When you don’t know how to start a piece of writing, you’ll find parallels to your argument in the most unlikely places, for there is nothing new under the sun.
“Cloudy With a Chance of Meatballs” is one of my favorite movies. It’s quite simple, quite hilarious and quite insightful. A young scientist — Flint Lockwood (Bill Hader) — invents a machine that can turn water into food to save his starving small town. The trial run goes terribly, and the machine disappears into a cloud. A failure once again, Flint walks away dejected — until a slice of cheese falls on his head … and then some lettuce, tomato and a bun, until a whole storm of hamburgers pummels the town. Flint is a hero. 
Before long, humanity kicks in: The populace floods Flint’s laboratory with orders specifically tailored to each person. Flint appeals to every single one, and the machine (as well as the people) become bloated with food  — wild and dangerous.
Flint gives the people what they want, and it takes a whole movie for the customers to see how foolish they were to make such unhealthy demands. 
Last week, Martin Scorsese capitalized on his controversial statements regarding Marvel movies — that they were “not cinema,” as he told Empire Magazine. In an op-ed for The New York Times, Scorsese did not recoil but rather expanded on his thoughts regarding the kinds of movies big studios like Marvel put out.
“Many of the elements that define cinema as I know it are there in Marvel pictures,” Scorsese writes. “What’s not there is revelation, mystery or genuine emotional danger. Nothing is at risk. The pictures are made to satisfy a specific set of demands, and they are designed as variations on a finite number of themes.”
First, we love a guy who calls movies “pictures.” Second, I agree.
Scorsese makes the case that movies are an art form because they carry intense emotional impact, take risks, speak to our common humanity — and all this spouts from a single artist. 
Richard Brody, writing for The New Yorker, writes that the idea supporting Scorsese’s argument is that of the “auteur.” 
“‘Auteur’ [signifies] the idea of the director as an artist who, though self-evidently not the sole artist working on most movies, is more than a conductor or stage manager,” Brody writes.
A true auteur director is one who is so involved in the construction of the film that what he or she says goes, and the result is a film that accurately captures their worldview, not the expectations of studio executives or a bunch of fans.
Scorsese cites some of these kinds of artists working today as some of his favorites: Paul Thomas Anderson, Claire Denis, Kathryn Bigelow, Wes Anderson, Spike Lee. There’s a reason these names are famous: We know they are directors in the true sense of the word. Their names conjure images with a distinct look, stories with specific themes and feelings with universal wings.
So, the problem — and Brody argues this, too — is not the content of Marvel films but the Marvel of it all. As Scorsese says, there’s little to no risk involved in these movies. They are made primarily (not solely) to appeal to the audience, to tickle their senses — not to challenge them, not to force them to walk a mile in a character’s shoes, not to make them uncomfortable.
Such was the plight of Flint Lockwood. He created something beautiful that was quickly handed over to the whims of the masses. In their hands, the machine malfunctioned; it did not do what it was designed to do. When all your energy is concentrated on making people happy, you are not doing what you were designed to do.
Too deep? Let’s bring it back to the cute old man with glasses.
Scorsese has helped me understand movies better. I want to believe in a world where “cinema” is not pretentious for most people because everyone could use a little more empathy. And that’s what critic Roger Ebert called movies: “an empathy machine.” 
If all we get is a diet of carefully tailored films, we won’t get uncomfortable, and we won’t grow. Art expresses humanity, and humans (shocker!) are very, very complicated. If we’re not willing to wrestle with the complicated, sometimes shocking portraits of Travis Bickle in “Taxi Driver,” of Guido Anselmi in “8 1/2,” of Mookie in “Do the Right Thing,” of the Kim family in the best movie of 2019 (yes) “Parasite,” then will we be willing to try and understand real-life people who are even more complex than these screen characters? 
I hope you can see this isn’t about worshipping Scorsese. It’s not about abhorring superhero movies. It’s about you, me and our neighbor. We can be entertained by the cookie-cutter Marvel movies  — for movies should also be entertainment, and Marvel makes some really good cookies — but we must not settle. Our own humanity may be at stake.

From paintings and photographs to hand-drawn stickers, several unique pieces of artwork filled the Tutor Campus Center ballroom at the annual Cultural Art Expo, this year titled “You Belong,” and hosted by the Asian Pacific American Student Assembly Thursday.
The event featured diverse student artists Alfred Bordallo, Nishant Tripathi, Alexia Sambrano, Marcia Cagandahan, Autumn Gupta, Brian Xu, Sarah Wang, Yichen Zhang and Ambika Nuggihalli. 
“I’m most happy about how much exposure and space we’re giving to artists, because I think we give a lot of space to people who are good at singing and dancing and things like that, but not necessarily to people who are good at photographing or making art,” said APASA member Jessica Kim, a sophomore majoring in environmental engineering. “I’m really happy that this is one of the only events on campus where they get more exposure.”
Cagandahan, a freshman majoring in animation, showcased paintings inspired by her and her parents’ experience in the Philippines, demonstrating what a Filipino local would see every day through their eyes. Her art highlighted close-up shots of her culture such as the jeepney, a major form of transportation, a lantern and an animation of a traditional Filipino dance.
“This is actually my first time [at an expo] so it’s really exhilarating, because usually either one of my drawings gets posted up in a museum … but that’s just one,” Cagandahan said. “But to have this whole gallery and to interact with people – I’m already having a good time, I’m just vibing.” 
Sambrano, a junior majoring in neuroscience and cognitive science, showcased paintings titled “La Ansiedad” based on Lotería, a Mexican bingo game, and “Impending Doom,” which many interpret as a person drowning or falling from the sky. Her other art pieces also emphasize mental health, sexuality and femininity. 
“Looking back now, these paintings are a reminder of the strength that it took for me to lift myself back up … I’m more focused on myself as a person and my growth, rather than what I could do better or how I’m not perfect,” Sambrano said. “No one is perfect. That’s also another thing that my art deals with, embracing yourself for who you are. All your flaws and imperfections are a part of you and that’s just how you come out as a person. And if there are certain people who don’t like that, then that’s on them.”
With vendors from Northern Cafe and Chichen Itza, attendees enjoyed food and drinks while watching singers and dancers perform on a stage. Attendees also participated by making their own art at various assembly booths including do-it-yourself eco lip scrubs, face painting, tie-dye shirts, an embroidery table, an art canvas, inspirational wall and a pledge-to-vote table. There was also an APASA gallery that featured poster boards with information and infographics on immigration and other identity issues. 
Through diverse booths, performances and artwork, the main goal of the event was to drive an ambition within guests to challenge the idea of “acceptable.”
“We just really wanted to stress the theme of inclusion this year, so if you walk around looking at the art or performances, especially if you look at the APASA gallery, you’ll find a lot of information on people who might not really feel at place in whatever way – culturally or other identity-wise,” Kim said. “So … the whole team really wanted to create a space where you can come in and see how other people discover how they belong.”

Royalty made a special appearance Saturday night at USC. 
The Queer and Ally Student Assembly’s 10th annual drag show, dubbed the “House of Troy,” drew scores of students from all across campus. The night was filled with jaw-dropping performances, laughter and cheers, and a lot of Billie Eilish music. 
The audience was greeted by host Dillon Powell. A fashion publicist and designer, he introduced the judging panel, gave a brief history of the drag show and emphasized the importance of positivity. 
According to senior Angel Zayas, the show’s director, producer and artist behind drag persona Angel Dust, this was the biggest collegiate drag show in the country. 
“The university scene is a drag scene that is often overlooked,” Zayas said. “We’ve never gotten any mention of it in popular media when it comes to things like “RuPaul’s Drag Race” or any reality-based competition,” Zayas, who is majoring in theater, said. 
Zayas hoped the drag show was able to provide more visibility for QuASA within the L.A. and queer USC communities. 
“QuASA, in itself, is very unknown to people outside the queer community, and even then, the queer community sometimes doesn’t know who [QuASA is],” Zayas said. “It’s kind of like us also trying to put QuASA on the map for something in the same way our film school is on the map … and our marching band. We wanted to add to that legacy that USC has, and more importantly, add to that legacy that queer students at USC have.”
The show kicked off with a runway walk to “Sissy That Walk” by RuPaul. The student performers wore outfits fit for royalty — gowns that sparkled in the spotlight and golden crowns. 
Act one of the show featured diverse student talent, including drag kings, AFAB (assigned female at birth) queens and drag queens. Each of the eight performance pieces were created and produced by each performer.
Renee Ye, a sophomore majoring in media arts and practice, and the artist behind Lil Baby Bok Choy, sewed together all of her outfits for her performance number. 
This is Ye’s first time performing in the drag show. Ye, although nervous about being a bio queen, a woman drag queen, hopes the drag show will open people’s minds about the inclusivity of drag. 
“Because [the drag show] is opened to the public, it isn’t just for the USC eye,” Ye said. “Anybody can come and anybody can see your work, and you just have to prove to them that you are worth seeing.” 
For Warren Hastings, a senior majoring in music industry and the artist behind wren, drag has made him feel more comfortable in his skin.
“There was a lot that I didn’t even know how to address inside myself before I started watching other people living their lives so thoroughly and truly,” Hastings said. “I think for me a big part of what it is, is that I get to do something that I used to judge myself for wanting for so long. And I have people show me respect for it.”
Throughout the night, the judges panel praised the student performers, highlighting the importance behind giving people opportunities to showcase their art. 
One of the most memorable moments of the night was Angel Dust’s performance. Starting off with a sound bite from “Tribute to Troy,” Angel Dust delivered a performance with choreography that could give Beyoncé’s Coachella set a run for its money. 
Act two featured a performance by each judge, nine of whom have appeared on “RuPaul’s Drag Race.” Another judge on the show was the winner of “The Boulet Brothers’ “Dragula” season three, drag king Landon Cider. Cider spoke throughout the evening of his excitement to represent “a subculture within a subculture.” 
The judges’ performances wowed the crowd. Many of them delivered powerful lip sync performances, such as a burlesque piece by drag queen Scarlet Envy and an emotional rendition of “This is Me” from the musical “The Greatest Showman” by drag queen Ongina. For a few minutes, drag queen Silky Ganache engaged with the audience as everyone in the ballroom sang along to the Fugees’ rendition of “Killing Me Softly.” 
Lots of factors were involved with picking the judges for the evening, but Zayas mainly wanted to pick performers that were local to the L.A. community. 
“House of Troy is more than it being … the drag house of USC. We’re influenced by the other L.A. communities,” Zayas said. “And so I wanted to definitely make sure it was very locally represented, as well as people who just wanted to celebrate with us.”
The drag show ended with both student performers and judges on the stage, and a few speakers shared words of recognition and appreciation.
“Drag takes a lot of hard work, and each and every single performer put just as much hard work in tonight as the other,” said drag queen Gia Gunn. 
“So please remember that the moment is now. Love each other, cherish each other and just be who you are.”

The USC women’s basketball team defeated the Virginia Cavaliers 59-49 in its home opener Saturday. The Trojans’ matchup with the ACC school measured the young team’s potential to take on its ranked conference opponents later in the season.
The Trojans took the lead with just over five minutes remaining in the first quarter and didn’t look back. The game was all about defense — both teams kept each other’s field goal percentages low and the backcourts dry on the stat sheet. 
Head coach Mark Trakh was especially proud of the team’s persistent pressure on Virginia even with a steady lead.
“It was 40 minutes of defense,” Trakh said. “I mean, it was 40 minutes — every time down, did they not struggle? Every single time we did not want to give up anything easy at any point, so I was really proud of that.” 
Trakh’s lineups focused on the team’s freshmen, who made up five of the nine players who saw action in Sunday’s contest. Among them was freshman guard Endyia Rogers, who showed out in the second half despite a slow start to finish with 10 points and six rebounds. 
Another notable performance came from freshman guard Kyra White. The numbers on the stat sheet don’t entirely reflect White’s strong showing. She guarded Virginia senior Jocelyn Willoughby and held the first-team All-ACC guard to 10 points and four rebounds to prove her tenacity on the defensive end of the floor. 
Graduate transfer guard Stephanie Watts posted her first double-double as a Trojan with 14 points and 12 rebounds, playing 32 minutes and adding five blocks on the game. 
Even after besting her impressive performance against CSUN on Tuesday, Watts still saw the ability in her freshman teammates to produce for themselves.
“They’re just so willing and eager to learn,” Watts said. “They’ll be like, ‘Oh, should I play this a different way?’ during the game, like they want to know [and] they want to do better.”
The Trojans’ presence down low adjusted throughout the game with Trakh incorporating freshman forward Alissa Pili, senior forward Kayla Overbeck and freshman center Angel Jackson. The trio took on Virginia’s 6-foot-3 senior forward Lisa Jablonowski and 5-foot-11 freshman guard Carole Miller, totaling 15 rebounds and four blocks between the three of them. This was Overbeck’s first game, as she sat out against CSUN due to an injury.
The competitive matchups between USC and Virginia extended to the sidelines as well. Virginia head coach Tina Thompson’s knowledge of USC’s basketball program could rival Trakh’s — she was a three-time All Pac-10 selection and second-team All-American for Southern California from 1993 to 1997. 
Thompson’s No. 14 jersey was retired by USC in a pregame ceremony. Former USC assistant Fred Williams presented her framed jersey in front of both Thompson’s former teammates and her current team.
Besides multiple NCAA honors, Thompson put together one of the most impressive careers in WNBA history. With four championships and nine All-Star appearances, as well as two Olympic Gold Medals from the 2004 Athens Games and the 2008 Beijing Games, Thompson’s resume earned her an induction into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame’s 2018 class. 
“To see her jersey up there was just something so well deserved,” Watts said. “So we’re all really happy for her and can’t wait to celebrate her even more.”
The game gave the Trojans their second straight win to start the season and evened Virginia’s record at 1-1. 
USC will have several days to rest before hitting the road for a Thursday game against University of California, Riverside and a Monday game against UC Santa Barbara.

USC football’s 31-26 victory over Arizona State in Tempe, Ariz. Saturday displayed two truths of the soon-to-end tenure of head coach Clay Helton. As has been the case for a few years, the Trojans showcased elite individual talent that allowed the team to gain an advantage over ASU, but the team’s inability to put it all together for an extended period of time resulted in a lackluster performance.
USC provided a vision of that ideal team with a nearly perfect first quarter. Freshman quarterback Kedon Slovis was absolutely dominant, throwing four touchdowns and breaking the team record for passing yards in a first quarter with 297. This included what is likely Slovis’ best throw of the season, a frozen rope that traveled 35 yards between three defenders before finding sophomore wide receiver Amon-Ra St. Brown’s hands en route to a 95-yard touchdown and a 28-7 lead.
Slovis and co. had so many plays where the sheer level of talent made me say “whoa.” The defense wasn’t far behind, forcing two Sun Devil punts and only allowing a touchdown because of a 97-yard kickoff return. But that lapse in discipline — or execution, whatever you want to call it — kept the Trojans from putting this game away in the early going.
Things really started to go wrong in the second quarter, when the offense was unable to punish Arizona State for two turnovers. It was an all-or-nothing half for the defense, which allowed a 62-yard touchdown to redshirt junior wide receiver Frank Darby. 
Here are the results of the Trojans’ second-half drives: turnover on downs, field goal, fumble, punt, punt, punt. Only the field goal drive took up more than six plays, and the second-to-last possession would’ve ended in a Slovis pick-six if not for a holding call on ASU. Granted, Slovis departed the game with a leg cramp and redshirt junior Matt Fink took over on a few of those possessions, but it was startling just how incapable the offense was after appearing unstoppable for the first 15 minutes.
The defense, on the other hand, at times appeared unable to do anything to stop backup freshman quarterback Joey Yellen, who threw four touchdowns on the afternoon. It was alarming that a defense with as much talent as the Trojans’ wasn’t able to bottle up a signal-caller making his first collegiate start. 
Yellen played in place of injured freshman starter Jayden Daniels, and it’s hard not to think that this would’ve been a Sun Devils victory had Daniels been able to go. Not that Helton has much of a chance to retain his position, but a loss to the team that fell to Colorado at home and which didn’t have its starting quarterback would have left a real sour taste at the end of Helton’s reign.
However, in the end, Helton was bailed out by his team’s talent. Redshirt senior defensive lineman Christian Rector, who has struggled with nagging injuries all year, made his first huge play of the season by deflecting a pass in front of him before laying out to cradle it for the game-sealing interception. It was a miraculous play, and, judging from the progress ASU was making on its final drive, a necessary one for the Trojans to emerge victorious.
Before you keep reading, try to think of a game during the Helton era in which the whole team fired on all cylinders from beginning to end. It’s pretty difficult to name one that USC has dominated until the final whistle, a truly satisfying win in every facet. Victories over Stanford and Arizona earlier this season come to mind, but those were home matchups with pretty bad teams. The best teams — a level the Trojans aspire to reach — beat down on inferior competition but also take care of business against stronger foes by executing in every area for 60 minutes.
Take No. 2 LSU’s 46-41 win over No. 3 Alabama Saturday. It was fitting that these two games ran in the same time slot because it gave USC fans a glimpse of what they missed out on. Tigers head coach Ed Orgeron filled the same position for USC on an interim basis in 2013 before then-athletic director Pat Haden passed him over for the permanent role in favor of Steve Sarkisian.
Since then, USC has had four athletic directors, Sarkisian was fired in no small part due to alcohol-related incidents, Helton’s teams have regressed and Orgeron has built one of college football’s best programs in Baton Rouge. It must have hurt USC fans who, like me, had a second screen up to watch Orgeron go toe-to-toe with Alabama head coach Nick Saban and come out on top. A guy like that might be useful next year when the Trojans kick off their season against the Crimson Tide in Arlington, Texas.
LSU is successful because its offense, defense and special teams deliver for four quarters game in and game out. It’s not easy to put it all together, but it’s what a program of USC’s caliber deserves.
For now, Trojan fans can only look longingly to the past and wonder about the future because there’s no chance at reaching that level with the present staff.

The No. 4 USC men’s water polo team delivered a decisive 10-7 win over No. 1 UCLA Saturday. The win continued the Trojans’ three-game winning streak and keeps them undefeated in MPSF conference play. 
With this victory and wins over then-No. 1 Stanford and No. 12 San Jose State at home last weekend, the Trojans are turning the season around as they look to defend last year’s national championship. 
The Trojan defense was formidable out of the gate, as sophomore goalie Nic Porter collected two saves early on. Redshirt senior 2-meter Sam Slobodien blocked a UCLA shot and drew an exclusion to open the scoring on a power play with an assist from sophomore driver Hannes Daube almost four minutes into the first period.  
After the Bruins turned the ball over to senior driver Marin Dasic, sophomore 2-meter Jake Ehrhardt added his name to the score sheet. Though UCLA junior attacker Nicolas Saveljic was able to sneak one in on a power play, USC quickly answered on its next drive with a goal from redshirt junior driver Luke Wyatt. 
This situation was replicated in the last 30 seconds of the period. UCLA sophomore attacker Ashworth Molthen scored on a man down, and Ehrhardt responded with his second goal of the day.
After both teams took several shots late in the second period, Dasic was able to bring the score to 5-2 with an assist from Wyatt. Bruins freshman attacker Andy Rodgers managed to send one to the back of the net in the last minute, but the Trojans took advantage in transition with a center-score from Slobodien. 
The third frame brought a hard press from UCLA, drawing an exclusion on Daube to allow junior attacker Chasen Travisano to score on a 6-on-5. Dasic didn’t let the Bruins celebrate for long, scoring a near-side goal with help from freshman driver Chris Sturtevant. 
Daube commented on the team’s adjustment to UCLA’s defensive shift.
“We knew they were going to come out strong. We just had to lead going into the third quarter,” Daube said. “And we knew that we were either going to close it out right there or give them a chance to come back in the game. So we came together in the huddle and just motivated each other, reminded us to stay strong and be with each other.”
Entering the fourth with a 3-point lead, the Trojans focused on moving the ball and minimizing the Bruins’ scoring opportunities. About two minutes in, Dasic collected his third goal of the day on a man-up, but UCLA answered with goals from sophomore attacker/utility Jake Cavano and Saveljic after a timeout. 
USC brought its final score to 10 with goals from Daube and junior driver Jacob Mercep. Even with one more goal by Saveljic, the Bruins ultimately were unable to close the gap. 
With one more MPSF game to go against Cal Saturday before heading into the MPSF Tournament the following weekend, the Trojans are looking to extend their winning streak against some of the toughest teams in the conference. 
“Cal is going to be extremely dangerous,” head coach Marko Pintaric said. “They’re very young, they’re very explosive, they play press, the freshman goalie is very energetic. And you don’t take any opponent this year for granted, and we are getting ready. You’re taking every game like it’s the last game of the season, in a way, because we’re in that position.”
The Trojans’ matchup against the Bears begins at 1 p.m. in Berkeley.

Land of “fit teas” and thirst traps, Instagram is where we millennials and Generation Z have made our home. After all, we can’t exactly afford houses with all that avocado toast we’re buying, so we build our nests among Kardashians and #sponsored posts.
Complaints of millennial narcissism gone wild on Instagram are rampant. The Habsburgs could sit and wait for a year to get one extra-inbred portrait of themselves, but heaven forbid I take 15 seconds out of my day to post a picture of myself.
With a billion monthly active users, Instagram’s popularity has exploded. More than half of these users are under the age of 35, placing this app firmly within the millennial and Gen Z territory. Are all 621 million of us just extreme narcissists? Perhaps. More likely, however, this accusation — like so many of the accusations lobbed at younger generations — are more reductive and simplistic than they are true. 
So why do we post on Instagram? Enjoyment, peer pressure, boredom. Many more reasons than words I have in this column. Let’s focus on this: the representation of our lives in the digital sphere. Social media offers us a perfectly curated digital record. Our memories are made incarnate online; they’re preserved in perpetuity.
But more than that, they are perfected. Camera in hand, we are our own historians. What we record is a heightened reality. Shift the camera a couple of feet to capture the stunning, picturesque sunset. No one ever has to know about the unsightly pile of litter just outside of the camera’s view. We can record our memories and remember them how we want to, not how they were.
We curate a life for 
ourselves online that matches the perfected aesthetic sensibilities we aim for but can never quite achieve. Thus, Instagram is not just a representation of our lives but a “re-presentation” — a construction that cleaves reality into fragments and reconstitutes them into an idealized composite that we can control. 
The visual nature of photography as well as the presentational and permanent nature of Instagram make it the perfect platform for this “re-presentation.” Our profile becomes a tangible record of this new life we construct for ourselves. We solidify this newly-minted version of ourselves within the digital pages of the timeline. The sensible grid that organizes our profile creates an illusion of order for this new sense of self.
We enter the cultural record with our offering to the digital gods and perform these new identities until they become real — at least online. A participatory medium, Instagram invites our audience — friends, family, even strangers — to engage in the construction and reinforcement of these new identities. Each like, comment and view offers a quantifiable measure of our success in reimagining ourselves.
As more and more aspects of our lives enter the digital space, our collective ability to distinguish reality from its online avatar diminishes. Ironically, that only further pushes us to grasp for what is real, what seems authentic against the current of increasingly fake representations. Our lives seem to have shifted from the world in front of us — the one we can touch, smell and feel — to the one in our hands: this secondary digital world unlocked by our smartphones.
In the face of this increasingly digital age, there is an understandable desire to establish and confirm the reality of one’s own being, to scream “I exist” in the face of the incoming digital void. Yet this impetus only pushes us further into the digital space as we post and post and post, hoping to confirm our own actuality in the cultural record of Instagram through the validation of others.
Only time will tell if we will be able to untangle ourselves from the digital embodiments we’ve built or if reality and simulation will merge until the digital becomes the real. But these inclinations are hardly new. Humans have always constructed new identities for themselves. They’ve always told stories and asserted these reconstructions in the cultural record: in paintings, plays and films. So don’t fret too much about our generation. 
After all, to be human is to grapple with your own story and how you tell it. Sometimes those stories come in the form of Instagram posts.
