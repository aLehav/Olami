Rising junior Kwayera Burrows knew she wanted to study abroad before she was accepted into USC. During her freshman year as a mechanical engineering major with a heavy course load, she was unsure if she would be able to do so and still graduate in four years. Under the guidance of a new adviser her sophomore year, Burrows made plans to attend the University of Botswana in Fall 2020 to participate in community service with local nongovernmental organizations. 
“I was really excited about spending a semester abroad, and I’m especially interested in community service — the place where I was going, they have a lot of NGOs,” Burrows said. “I was just overall excited for a new experience, getting new perspectives, traveling the world more.”
With uncertainty surrounding international travel and the resumption of in-person fall classes, USC extended the suspension of its study abroad programs through Fall 2020 May 11. Students were given the option to defer their semester abroad and were assured their academic continuity would not be affected. The decision followed the Office of Overseas Studies’ announcement via email April 20 that all programs beginning before Aug. 15 would be canceled due to the ongoing pandemic. 
“We have made this difficult decision based on health and safety concerns and the high degree of uncertainty associated with international travel and host country measures,” the email read.  
Though Burrows was given the option to defer study abroad to Spring 2021 or move to a program that started after Aug. 15, she no longer believes she would be able to fit a semester abroad into her academic schedule. 
“It’s just a difficult situation because it’s not like there’s anything that could have made it better, but it also just feels a little bit unfair that I had this one semester that I was able to study abroad, and then that’s the one semester that it got canceled,” Burrows said.
Andrea Rodriguez, a rising junior majoring in neuroscience who planned to study in New Zealand at the University of Auckland during the fall semester starting in July, believes the decision should have been relayed sooner. Rodriguez has been left to search for housing for the upcoming semester. 
“When I found out that we weren’t studying abroad anymore, I was very, very sad,” Rodriguez said. “Now I have so many other worries on top of me, like housing, like what am I going to do next year? — as opposed to the worries I already had where it’s finals season, classes are online, you’re dealing with [the] pandemic … [it’s] just so overwhelming to me.”
Rodriguez had also reached out to a professor in the neuroscience department at the University of Auckland to conduct research before she received the email from USC on her study abroad program cancellation. Like Burrows, Rodriguez is no longer able to fit study abroad in her schedule due to her prerequisites as a pre-health student. 
“The opportunity to possibly do research there was also going to work out with me really well because [the research] was also in the neuroscience department, which is what I’m majoring in at USC,” Rodriguez said. “I do have a research job at the Keck School [of Medicine], but it would be a totally different situation if I were able to do that.”
Because Burrows suspected study abroad would be suspended, she said she prepared by registering for fall semester classes. However, she had not applied for on- or off-campus housing and is unsure how she should proceed with uncertainty surrounding the status of fall classes. Faced with similar housing predicaments, Rodriguez has been searching for available leases with Burrows. 
“I wasn’t really worried about housing at all, but now I have to figure that out,” Burrows said. “But also I don’t even know if we are going to be on campus in the fall, so should I try to get housing?”
Regarding accommodations for students who were scheduled to study abroad in the fall, USC Housing Director Chris Ponsiglione said in an email to the Daily Trojan that students will still be allowed to register for University housing. This arrangement also applies to other students who had not planned to study abroad. 
“Students can still apply for USC Housing if they have not already. However, assignments are not guaranteed and currently on hold until the university formalizes plans for the fall semester,” the email read.
Rising senior Ankit Shah is enrolled in the World Bachelor in Business program, which relies on study abroad. Students in the Marshall School of Business program spend their first year at USC, second year at the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, third year at Università Bocconi in Milan and fourth year at one of the three locations of their choosing to conclude their degree program. 
Shah originally planned to return to USC for his last year but recently decided to study in Hong Kong where classes are being held in person. With hybrid or online classes being a possibility at USC, Shah said he prefers an in-person experience.  
“At the end of the day, the city of L.A. is really what’s pulling me back or really is what drives me toward USC,” Shah said. “L.A. is still probably going to be pretty unsafe, no matter how much USC says ’We’re going to do a hybrid model’ … It just wasn’t enough for me, especially when you start factoring in the amount of money that I’d have to pay.”
Shah was able to switch his decision from USC to HKUST but now has to find housing in Hong Kong and cancel the lease he had already signed in Los Angeles.
Although this was not the senior year he had originally planned, Shah said he had always wanted to return to Hong Kong and is trying to make the best of the situation.
“At the end of the day, I think my overall takeaway from all this was you can be sad about it, and you can complain and reminisce,” Shah said. “Or you could just face reality and find the positive in it.”

For students in undocumented or mixed-status families like Alexia Sambrano, a rising junior majoring in neuroscience and cognitive science, the coronavirus pandemic has caused struggles most citizens don’t face — like not qualifying for the federal Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act direct payments and, in Sambrano’s case, being the sole breadwinner for her household. 
“My parents are undocumented. My mom doesn’t work, and my dad lost his job — he was laid off when everything happened,” Sambrano said. “I was the only one, within the first month [after USC’s transition to online classes who] was the only sole provider through my part-time, minimum-wage student worker position.” 
To help others in similar situations, students in Emerson Whitney’s “Contemporary Issues in LGBTQ Studies” course, including Sambrano, created the USC Care Collective, a website and fundraiser designed to provide resources to marginalized communities on campus. Since its launch via social media and advertising on student assemblies’ newsletters April 23, a total of $840 has been distributed to more than 20 students who applied to the fund.
“It’s been super nice and really encouraging to see so many people interact with our posts and talk about [the Care Collective],” Sambrano said. “Seeing the impact that it’s actually having is kind of mind-blowing — not scary, but it’s shocking because a lot of people are actually paying attention to us.”
Whitney’s course usually requires a final project that focuses on connecting LGBTQ issues to problems faced by other marginalized communities. Following the transition to remote learning, Whitney made the assignment optional. Sambrano, who is the Care Collective’s lead creator, and Seth Mitchell, a graduate student studying occupational therapy, originally planned to create a website that would provide information and educate students on diversity and inclusion resources available on campus for their final project. Their initial project evolved into the Care Collective, which is similarly dedicated to student solidarity but focuses more on providing identity-specific financial aid. 
Inspired by a course reading by Leah Lakshmi Piepzna-Samarasinha titled “Care Work: Dreaming Disability Justice,” a book about increasing access to resources for marginalized communities, Sambrano, Mitchell and Lupe Mota, another student in the course who was not a part of Mitchell and Sambrano’s original idea, decided to highlight the book’s concept of a care web in their final project. A care web, as coined by the reading, is a system of mutual aid where communities, especially those that are marginalized, come together and help one other by providing resources to each other, rather than relying on top-down assistance. Sambrano said she and her classmates felt the need to emphasize the care web aspect of the intiative that serves marginalized communities, such as undocumented and international students, since many USC resources are not openly available to them.
“I wanted to emphasize it and the class wanted to emphasize it as well, that it was specifically for [Black and indigenous individuals, people of color], low-income, undocumented, queer and trans students, just because these are the communities that are being affected the most by COVID, and we don’t see a lot of that coming from USC as a whole,” Sambrano said.
To apply to the Care Collective, students complete an online form that requires applicants to provide a USC email address and list which marginalized communities they identify with. Besides access to funds, the website also includes links to various identity-specific resources, including the Undocumented Trojans Online Resource Center and Student Equity and Inclusion Programs. A radical reading list, spearheaded by Mota, a 2020 graduate, is also available on the website and features works that focus on communities and topics often not discussed in academia, such as anarchic studies and indigenous histories. Mota, a researcher for the Department of Art History and a Mellon Mays undergraduate research fellow who studied faculty diversity in colleges and universities, said she was initially unsure what to contribute to the collective but ultimately decided to incorporate her knowledge from past academic research. 
“I spent hours trying to figure out ways in which I could bring knowledge … that I feel like most marginalized communities would access and could benefit from accessing,” Mota said. “I think what was really special about this collective was that we all took up certain roles that we could, in our own capacity, take care of.” 
With links to small businesses run by USC students, as well as a page accepting direct donations to provide financial relief to students in need of assistance, the collective initially planned on collecting donations through their website. However, once the website had been running for two weeks, Sambrano found most of the website’s traffic went toward the identity-specific resources and radical reading list rather than the small businesses and student direct payment pages. This prompted Sambrano and Mitchell to launch a GoFundMe campaign to provide aid for students in need who are not qualified to receive financial relief through the coronavirus relief bill, such as undocumented individuals. 
Under the Higher Education Emergency Relief Fund, USC received $19.3 million to provide financial assistance to students facing dire circumstances during the pandemic. However, these funds are not available to DACA or international students, those who do not achieve satisfactory academic progress and other students, such as those with prior drug convictions, who do not qualify for federal financial aid. The Care Collective aims to redress this gap.
“What we were really concerned about was finances for those in need, with uncertainty around evictions and rent freezes, as well as regular everyday needs, like groceries,” Mitchell said. “We were concerned for our community and those students who traditionally get left behind by administration.”
Honorio Antonio, a rising junior majoring in psychology, was one of the students who received funds from the GoFundMe page. Using his work-study money to pay his internet bill to be able to take online classes, Antonio said the Care Collective supplied not only compensation for his lost funds but affirmation that the group was looking out for marginalized students. 
“What was given to me just came at the perfect time,” Antonio said. “In a way, it’s providing us with that reassurance that everything’s going to be OK more than the actual physical value of the money that’s being given.”
With uncertainty about whether classes will resume in person in the fall, programming departments such as the Queer & Ally Student Assembly have adjusted to promoting their resources and preparing to hold events online. QuASA assistant director Ren Ye said the Care Collective has proven helpful in highlighting QuASA, as well as other LGBTQ resources on campus, to students who may need them. 
“It’s hard to advocate for a group that’s underrepresented, and the initiative that the [USC Care Collective] is providing is really helpful,” Ye said. “[QuASA has historically had] to do a lot of tabling fundraising events in order to kind of get traction or get our name out to students who might not necessarily know that there are LGBT resources that are friendly … Having something like this really helps us bring attention to this stuff.” 
The Care Collective founders hope the initiative will remain active and available following the pandemic. Sambrano said she aims to work with Whitney to incorporate the Care Collective into his future classes so students can continue adding up-to-date resources and publicizing the website. Sharing resources with students in need is important now more than ever due to rapidly changing circumstances, Sambrano and Mota said.
“We don’t know what the state of the world is, even in a month or two,” Mota said. “I hope that people see [the Care Collective], and they want to create their own or donate to this one or another one that they want to give back to.”

Walking up to the USC Housing booth outside Troy Hall on her scheduled move-out day to retrieve her boxes and drop off her USC Bookstore textbooks, Kathrin Altmann was not expecting the process to go so smoothly. She thought her move-out experience would be similar to the one she had had moving her boyfriend out of his apartment complex — moving out his belongings little by little, with no communication from the landlord on specific protocols or social distancing guidelines. 
For students living in off-campus housing complexes, Altmann, a graduate student studying communication management, said her boyfriend had been facing insufficient communication from landlords amid the pandemic. Other students have battled issues with rent payments, many contending that the remainder of their rent should be credited, reduced or refunded as the pandemic progresses. 
Ahmad Faisal, a 2020 graduate who majored in architecture, has lived in Tuscany Apartments since his junior year. Faisal’s two roommates moved out when classes first transitioned online and students in the USC area were asked to return home. Faisal decided to stay and ride out his yearlong lease, which his parents will cover through July.
“It’s completely empty now,” Faisal said. “Ever since spring break, I’ve been living alone in this apartment, which is a good thing and a bad thing because I technically have a three-bedroom apartment to myself, so there’s a lot of space and stuff, but also at the same time, it gets really lonely … when I would leave my room and go outside [before the pandemic], I would always see people around, but now I barely see anyone. Even the leasing office has been shut down.”
Tuscany Apartments prohibited common access to its public amenities, including gyms, study lounges and the pool, beginning March 13 due to concerns regarding community transmission of the coronavirus. However, the apartment complex continued to charge residents the full price of their rent and denied requests to end leases, while residents of University-owned housing received prorated refunds based on their checkout date, regardless of the length of their contracted rental period.
“I thought [USC Housing made] a very morally ethical decision because if [students] aren’t living [in housing], why should they be paying rent?” Faisal said. “Given the circumstances where so many people have moved out, I don’t think it’s fair for people like my roommates, who did move out so early on, to keep having to pay rent until the end of July.” 
At the time of publication, other housing complexes near campus, such as The Lorenzo and West 27th, are also mandating residents pay their monthly rent, despite many vacating their rooms. Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti banned no-fault evictions resulting from pandemic-related changes in financial circumstances March 23 and has extended the policy through the end of the local state of emergency.
Some students, including several who have lost their jobs amid the pandemic fallout, feel the housing complexes’ no-refund policy is unfair given the unforeseeable circumstances that forced them from their residences. Students living at Lorenzo Apartments started a petition calling for management to temporarily reduce their monthly rental rates.
“Although most of the residents have already left the complex due to fear of their own safety … Lorenzo still charges all residents,” the petition read. “Students are [on] a tight budget. Many have lost their source of income and are forced to head back home. These students have to figure out a way to pay their rent.”
The petition, started by a group named Lorenzo Residents, cites the cancellation of amenities and services that Lorenzo management typically provides, such as weekly events, twice-weekly free meals and in-person fitness classes, as grounds for modification to rental contracts. The benefits, according to the petition, are what many believe justify the price tag of renting a room at the housing complex.
However, Lorenzo management has upheld the complex’s original rental rates despite the cancellation of benefits. According to the petition, students who have lost their main sources of income face tighter budgets and may not be able to pay the $1,140 for rent and utilities.
Emma Zhang, a Tuscany resident who traveled back to China, said she also believes she should not be asked to pay rent when she is not physically present in her apartment. 
“I just packed everything into boxes, just in case I couldn’t go back in time to move out so somebody else [could help me move out],” said Zhang, who recently graduated with a master’s degree in global communication. “The only thing that’s [bothering] me is I’m paying for housing without living there, so I’m actually paying for nothing.”
The University coronavirus website strongly advises students who live in off-campus non-University housing to discuss their individual situations with their current landlords or hire an attorney before taking any action related to off-campus housing because of the coronavirus pandemic. However, unlike other USC students facing issues with paying rents for off-campus housing complexes, Altmann is facing another problem: moving into her new apartment complex. 
Instead of staying in Troy Hall along with her other roommates who could not go back to their homes abroad, Altmann decided to pack a large suitcase with essential belongings and move in with her boyfriend at Park La Brea after USC asked students to vacate University housing, as classes would be held online for a week after spring break.
The week of virtual instruction stretched into months. While Altmann first worried about housing refunds and picking up her belongings, those issues were soon resolved, leaving her with another concern: finding a new apartment complex she and her boyfriend could stay in upon their leases’ expirations.
“Having to find a new place during this time … was obviously tricky because how do you look at apartments [with ongoing] social distancing?” Altmann said. 
After finding a place to live, the two also faced the issue of moving into a new apartment and buying new furniture. Previously living in University housing, Altmann owned few living essentials and had to find most of her furniture on Facebook Marketplace, Wayfair and Target, finding difficulty throughout the process since many items were sold out or not being manufactured at the time. 
“I do realize it’s a very privileged problem to have,” she said. “But you need a bed.” 
Moving to a housing complex farther away from campus, Altmann applied for a California license in early March in hopes of using a car for her commute. However, with the pandemic forcing the Department of Motor Vehicles to postpone driver’s license tests, Altmann is now concerned she will have to rely on public transportation in the fall if the pandemic does not subside.
“Riding buses right now, to me, doesn’t really seem safe healthwise,” Altmann said. “I’m very worried about not being able to get my license, get a car and get to where I need to be in fall because what if I [have an internship] or I work on campus? That’s something that is kind of worrying for me with the move.”
Compared to how USC Housing handled the situation — allowing students to remain on campus if they were unable to return home and issuing refunds — Altmann said she believes off-campus complexes should improve their communication with their residents amid the pandemic and ensure social distancing as leases are ending and residents are moving out. 
“It wasn’t like my boyfriend’s old complex wasn’t attentive, because if we had an issue, they came … but it was more corporate,” Altmann said. “[Our new landlord is] more like ‘Oh, I want to make sure that the tenants who are in there right now are going to be totally safe, so please wear masks, please wear gloves’ … With the other complex, I didn’t even know where we were going to drop off the key.”
With bans on international travel in place, Zhang also worries she will be unable to return to the United States in time to move out by her lease’s July 30 expiration date.
“There is a great possibility that I won’t be able to make [the move-out date],” Zhang said. “I still need to find a place to stay after that, I still need to know where I’m going to move my stuff to.”
In regard to move out guidelines, Zhang said housing complexes should be more cautious of social distancing and keep health and safety standards. She also said she believes off-campus locations should follow USC Housing’s lead by creating a schedule for resident move-out to limit students’ interpersonal contact. 
Faisal also said he would have liked more communication from his housing complex regarding the move-out process and wished landlords acknowledged that economic circumstances incurred by the pandemic may have impacted residents’ ability to pay rent. Privately owned residential complexes would benefit from better emergency planning and more thorough efforts to ensure residents’ well-being in these scenarios, Faisal said.
“I feel like it’s going to be very hard to get back to the ways things were before … but I feel like [housing complexes] do need to take care of how to go about this in the future in a more proactive way … just making sure that [housing complexes] are more hygienic over a period of time,” Faisal said. “They should be making more of an effort to make sure everyone does feel more [safe].”
For students holding leases in housing complexes closer to campus, many are weighing the costs between trying to break their lease and continuing to pay full price for their vacated room. Nicole Moreno, a rising senior majoring in cinema and media studies, said breaking her lease may prove to be more costly than paying full price for her vacated room at West 27th Place.
“It will be probably more money to try and get out of [the lease] than to just continue paying [full rent],” Moreno said. 
The University is offering students the chance to speak with housing lawyers about how to legally proceed during these circumstances. According to Moreno, one of her roommates spoke with a lawyer who advised that they continue to pay rent. 
Students who face similar circumstances of making full rent payments despite vacating their residences are starting to see their options for moving forward dwindle. Popular alternatives such as subleasing also appear to be less desirable avenues for reducing monthly payments for vacant rooms. 
“Everyone wants to sublease wherever they can [to anyone], but then again, no one’s looking for places to live,” Moreno said. 
For students like Zhang, subleasing is not a possibility, as most of her belongings remain in her apartment while international travel bans prevent her from retrieving them. In combination with potential tenants’ health and safety concerns, Zhang said she believes the possibility for subleasing is limited. 
“Since we’re [in a pandemic], people are more worried about hygiene and living in someone else’s place, so I don’t feel like people are willing to rent a room right now,” Zhang said. “It’s not an easy thing to do under the current situation.”
The circumstances surrounding the coronavirus pandemic place students in varied and complicated financial situations, Altmann said, and may be amplified for students with strained financial and legal resources.
“From my perspective as an international student, it’s really important to consider that not everyone has appropriate resources,” Altmann said. “There’s the stimulus check and the [Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security] Act, but we international students literally don’t get any of it. I don’t think landlords should not get their rent … but I think the state or government should step in and make sure no one gets evicted or at least … [landlords get] their money from the city or the state and not from people who don’t have money.”
Housing complexes contacted by the Daily Trojan, including Tuscany Apartments, The Lorenzo and West 27th, declined to comment.

Despite the rampant chaos and dysfunction that’s likely ensued since I left my throne as Daily Trojan sports editor, some positives still remain — one of them being the abundance of time that I have now, which leads me to the topic of today’s column: “The Last Dance.” 
For those of you who haven’t logged on to any form of social media in the past month, “The Last Dance” is a 10-part ESPN docuseries that chronicles the final season of Michael Jordan’s tenure with the Chicago Bulls. I binged every single episode recently and it was an honest-to-God masterpiece.
Often, the focus of this column is American politics. Today, however, we’re gonna shift the focus to American society, and American society should not strive to be like Mike. More specifically, American society should not strive to be like the Mike that “The Last Dance” portrays. 
First, calm down. I am aware that Michael Jordan is one of the greatest competitors in the history of sports. I would encourage any inspired American to try to reach the same heights that Michael did during his career.  
In fact, if anyone got even remotely close to six NBA Finals MVPs and 10 scoring titles, I’d buy their bobblehead, dedicate a shrine to it and shed all of my worldly possessions to worship their athletic greatness. 
Yes, Michael was a six-time NBA champion and the best player of all time. By the end of “The Last Dance,” that reality had already been successfully instilled into the nether regions of my consciousness. The documentary captured how great Michael truly was and sent one message clearly: Michael Jordan was an absolute badass. 
Immediately after watching the series, even I, a lifelong Lakers fan, had been fully converted — more than anything, I wanted to be like Mike. Not like Kobe, Shaq or Kareem — but Mike. 
However, the more I read about Michael after watching the series’ last episode, the more I realized that I was wrong. Michael Jordan was a badass, yes, but what “The Last Dance” fails to honestly explore is the fact that Michael, by many accounts, was a tyrannical bully.
I’m not saying that the documentary completely ignored some of Michael’s less savory qualities. In episode eight, an incident where Michael punched his teammate, Steve Kerr, in the face is described and recounted by both of the brawl’s participants. 
Rather than characterizing the event as what it was — a dick move — the documentary presents the incident at practice as a positive development in Michael and Kerr’s relationship.
Listen, I know sports is often the domain of testosterone-fueled egos, but you shouldn’t have to defend yourself against a sucker punch to mend a relationship with a co-worker. 
And Michael’s fight with Kerr wasn’t just a singular dick move but part of a recurring pattern of dick moves made over the course of Michael’s career. 
Along with Kerr, Michael also punched teammate Will Perdue at practice. This instance goes along with other dick moves such as Michael repeatedly deriding Bulls captain Bill Cartwright and mocking Bulls general manager Jerry Krause for his height and weight. In the documentary, this behavior is either excused, ignored or characterized as the traits of a champion. 
Many have analyzed Michael’s leadership style and come to various conclusions, one of them being that Michael suppressed his humanity and behaved this way to lift his team to greatness. 
That may be true. Michael does demonstrate some vulnerability in “The Last Dance,” nearly reaching the point of tears when discussing his harsh leadership style and obsession with winning.
I don’t discount the possibility that Michael did what he felt he had to do, but even if it’s true, we are still led to the same conclusion: His brutal leadership style and win-at-all-costs approach to basketball shouldn’t be the model we aspire toward. 
I’ve said it a thousand times — sports is a medium through which we spread and teach values. In an equally significant way, sports is also the most influential education on masculinity children receive as they grow up. 
If America embraced the Michael Jordan that is presented in “The Last Dance,” our society would be in shambles. The American family would crumble underneath everyone’s no-holds-barred, winner-take-all pursuit of success and children would claw and gauge each other’s eyes out at youth basketball games. 
It should be noted that for all the attention the documentary pays to Jordan’s athletic accomplishments, little is paid to how his personality affected his own personal relationships or to how some teammates felt like they played for, not with, Michael. Considering Michael had editorial control over the series, this is not surprising. 
And in exercising his editorial control, Michael made sure he had the last word in the documentary. 
“When people see this, they’re going to say, ‘Well, he wasn’t really a nice guy; he may have been a tyrant,’” MJ says right before the documentary ends. “Well, that’s you because you never won anything.”
C’mon, do you really think we’d be better off as a society if we all tried to be like Mike?

While USC football has pledged to “Take Back the West” by recruiting top high school talent in the Southern California area, other USC sports are also gearing up for the fall. Here’s a look at how USC’s soccer, men’s water polo, women’s tennis and women’s volleyball teams have bolstered their 2020 rosters.
Soccer
Last month, head coach Keidane McAlpine announced the addition of nine freshmen and one graduate transfer to the team after 12 players, including offensive contributors seniors forward Natalie Jacobs and midfielder Ashleigh Plumptre, graduated. 
“One of the lessons from last year’s injuries was that we needed to retool our depth, and I think this class certainly does that and much more for us,” McAlpine said. 
Graduate transfer forward Jennifer Westendorf can bring the experience and versatility the young team needs. Westendorf compiled 20 goals and 13 assists at Notre Dame and also played with the Brazilian U-20 Women’s National Team.
Other recruits include forward Angeles Escobar from Lancaster, Calif., who scored a record 181 goals across four varsity seasons, and No. 43 2020 recruit midfielder Alexa Gonzalez from Riverside. 
The team will also bring in Palo Alto native Talia Grossman and Emily Rhinehart from Fallston, Md. as goalkeepers who both held a goals against average at or below 0.50. They will compete with junior Anna Smith and redshirt junior Emily Cuthbert to fill the gap left by recent graduate Kaylie Collins.
Incoming freshman defenders Mary Shin and Anuhea Kane, both from Hawaii, will work to solidify the defensive line. McAlpine was drawn to their situational awareness and communication.
“Technically and tactically, they definitely have strengths that will accent our team and help provide different tools, as well as create much-needed depth,” McAlpine said. 
Men’s water polo
The men’s water polo team will see plenty of additional talent on its 2020 roster. 
Standout two-meter Max Miller from San Juan will fill the gap left behind by 2020 graduate centers Sam Slobodien and Matt Maier, as well as potential Olympian junior Jake Ehrhardt. Miller ranked No. 7 in all-time scoring for the CIF Southern Section with a career total of 512 goals. Incoming freshman Tony Nardelli will compete with him for time in center as a two-time MVP at California’s Mountain View High School.
“[Miller’s] talent in the water is one of a kind, be it his offensive goal-scoring prowess or his defensive ability to cancel the opponent’s best player,” head coach Marko Pintaric said.
Drive defenders Tom McGuire from Campolindo and Newport Harbor standout Reed Stemler will allow the Trojans to quickly convert and push their opponents to the perimeter. 
Oliver Von Karl from Miramonte High and another Newport Harbor recruit in Blake Jackson will compete for time in the cage this coming season. Jackson will be one to watch after collecting 391 saves as a junior.
“Blake’s admiration for the game of water polo and unparalleled desire to compete makes him the defensive backbone [of] every team he has played on,” Pintaric said. “His quick reaction times and great decision-making is a result of his incredible work ethic and his toughness, both mentally and physically.”
The Trojans will have to overcome the loss of graduated driver Marin Dasic and possibly the departure of potential Olympians junior drivers Marko Vavic and Hannes Daube. But USC’s offseason additions have the team poised to fill those gaps.
Women’s tennis 
The USC women’s tennis team has signed two prized recruits this spring in graduate transfer Clare McKee from Princeton and Scottsdale, Ariz. native McKenna Koenig. 
McKee spent her senior season as Princeton’s team captain, amassing impressive records of 16-5 in singles and 15-8 in doubles. This followed a three-season stretch in which the former five-star recruit led her team twice in wins. 
Koenig is a five-star high school recruit herself, ranking No. 69 nationally. A member of Heisman High School’s back-to-back singles state champion teams from 2017-18, Koenig also captured the doubles state title in 2018 after finishing runner-up the year prior. Koenig also brings experience from multiple victories in national USTA tournaments in both singles and doubles play. 
Koenig and McKee round out a 2020 recruiting class that also includes Naomi Cheong from Las Vegas and Snow Han from China. 
Women’s volleyball
The USC women’s volleyball team has been hot on the recruiting trail this spring. Three new players have signed for the upcoming season: blocker Aleksandra Gryka, libero Samantha Hastings and outside hitter Malaya Jones. 
Gryka hails from Warsaw, Poland and was a member of the Polish National Team in the 2017 FIVB U20 World Championships. Her decorated career as a middle blocker includes three first-place awards at the U18 and U20 Polish National Championships.
Hastings starred as a defensive specialist at Frisco Centennial High School in Texas, where she was twice named Texas District 9-5A Most Valuable Player and Defensive Player of the Year. 
Jones spent the first three years of her high school career at San Juan Hills High School in Mission Viejo, Calif., where she helped her team win state championships in 2017 and 2018. After lettering all three years, Jones transferred to Santa Margarita High School, where she earned a spot on the AVCA Under Armour All-American Watch List.
After a frustrating 18-14 season cut short in the second round of the NCAA Tournament, the Trojans hope these recruits can help the 2020 squad bounce back.

Experimenting with substances, drinking and partying is a cornerstone of many college students’ social life. Some may argue that these are simply rites of passage in the undergraduate experience, but it is imperative to remember where the line is drawn between use and abuse, especially in the wake of multiple substance-related student deaths. While the University has responded to pressures placed by students, faculty and Los Angeles Times headlines to address its mental health crisis by expanding resources, students must also be cognizant and conscious of their own well-being, especially when it comes to their relationships with substances. 
Four of the nine student deaths recorded last fall have been ruled drug overdoses. Some of the incidents were found to be related to the lethal synthetic opioid fentanyl, leading many in the community to speculate that the deaths were accidental rather than deliberate. That being said, the high risks associated with using prescription and illicit drugs may be indicative of further mental health concerns.
While not all drug users suffer from a diagnosable mental illness, it is important to consider that  substance use and addiction often occur comorbidly. Mental illnesses like anxiety and depression may be causally related to substance use. Inversely, substance use can lead to the onset of anxiety and depression. 
Research indicates that self-esteem may also play a role in a student’s proclivity to misuse substances. According to a study conducted by researchers at the University of Idaho and the University of Minnesota, undergraduate students with higher levels of self-critical perfectionism exhibited higher levels of drinking to cope compared to their peers, supporting pre-existing findings that suggested self-critical perfectionists engage in worser coping mechanisms. This is all the more relevant in a high-achieving academic environment like USC’s, where students are known to both “work hard, and play hard.” 
Additionally, illicit drug use (including popular party drugs like cocaine, ecstasy and hallucinogens), demonstrates an even stronger association to suicidality compared to other risk-taking behaviors. According to an article published in the Journal of Clinical Child and Adolescent Psychology, the habituation of using drugs with potentially lethal consequences may increase one’s acquired capability for suicidal behavior, desensitizing one’s fear of death. 
Excessive substance use may be easily excused, and even encouraged, in high-paced collegiate social environments, leaving underlying mental illness to go unchecked. Students engaging in substance abuse may be doing so not only to cope with an illness but also simply to maintain social status-quo. As a result, mental illness and maladaptive coping mechanisms are inconspicuously disguised in the thriving social scene of USC. 
The consequences of maintaining this norm include the perpetuation of an on-campus health crisis and preventable student deaths. While many students now remain bound to their homes, isolated from their friends and the campus social scene, it is paramount that personal time be allocated toward acknowledging mental well-being. 
For many students, the now-limited access to parties and events typically held during the school year can provide an opportunity to slow down, pause and reevaluate one’s intrapersonal relationships concerning mental health and substance use. This can be achieved through spending more time with family members, devising new self-care strategies, utilizing the Engemann Student Health Center’s TeleHealth resources and finding different outlets and environments to try alternative coping mechanisms. The increased time for respite and reflection offers benefits to personal well-being, whether or not a student may face diagnosable mental health concerns. 
Although the University along with the larger global community continues to face a public health crisis with the coronavirus, mental health must be at the forefront of the conversation. Students’ emotional and mental well-being is without a doubt a subject of concern in the face of radical changes in their academic environments. The long-term sustainability of USC ultimately depends just as much on the mental well-being of its students as it does on their physical health.

While the coronavirus is still the most pressing priority for state and federal governments, the response to the pandemic, quick implementation of restrictions and reopening guidelines prove that if the need is dire enough, countries have the capacity to work together to bring about drastic change. 
Over the past several months, social media feeds have been rife with visual evidence of the lockdown’s environmental relief. While some of the photos were exaggerated and the caption “the Earth is healing, we are the virus” became a comedic catchphrase, the principle itself holds true. As the economy shut down and people worked from home, levels of particulate emissions decreased drastically, and the environment healed itself — albeit temporarily.
The stay-at-home orders have been an unprecedented experiment in global emissions reduction. Around the world, people are experiencing cleaner air and clearer skies. Notably, in India, home to some of the most hazardous air pollution and toxic particulate emissions on the planet, NASA recorded the lowest atmospheric aerosol levels in 20 years, and people in northern villages reported seeing the Himalayas for the first time in decades.
Back at University Park Campus, clear views of downtown Los Angeles and the San Gabriel Mountains were regularly visible during March and April as traffic decreased by one-third. The fresh air and clean skies were a preview of what one of the largest cities in the world might look like if California could pass the legislation to have only zero-emission vehicles on the road.
As the world begins to reopen, the environmental impact of the end of society’s brief slumber is immediately noticeable. Cars are reclogging the roads, and freeways are filling up with commuters returning to their now-social-distancing-approved workspaces; greenhouse gas emissions have begun to cloud the landscape once again as a smoggy haze descends back over the downtown skyline.
The clear skies and clean air experienced during the stay-at-home order should be a wake-up call — while it simply is not realistic to halt the economy and bustle of everyday life, governments do have the means to invest in clean-air solutions and take a stronger stance on developing strategies to mitigate climate change. While the decline of pollutants was temporary, the message it sent was clear: The pandemic has shown that governments and citizens have the capacity to incite global change if an issue is prioritized enough. 
Air pollution isn’t only an environmental hazard but also a question of public health. Studies have shown that those living in industrial regions and areas of high levels of air pollution are at a greater risk for asthma and respiratory illnesses. It’s possible that the temporary respite from breathing unclean air could even be a factor in “flattening the curve” of illness. 
Research conducted during the 2003 SARS outbreak found that death rates in the most heavily polluted areas of China were twice as high as those in regions with better air quality. People living in these areas of extremely toxic air quality are already at a greater risk for respiratory illness and consequently are one of the groups most vulnerable to contracting the coronavirus.
While the temporary air quality improvement this spring came at a heavy cost, the effects are reproducible with a lot of hard work and effective policy changes. When the economy reopens, particulate pollutant levels will likely return to or exceed pre-coronavirus measurements. That being said, the government is in a unique position to declare air pollution and toxic emissions health emergencies of their own and prioritize the development of commercial-grade green energy alternatives along with more sustainable assembly line processes. It will be a long, grueling and intensive process to create fiscally feasible alternatives to traditional energy industries, but the state of the environment has people’s attention right now. In a rapidly changing world, it’s the perfect opportunity to enact even more change in hope of yielding a permanent difference.
While restarting fossil fuel industries results in more immediate financial return, renewables are a more sustainable long-term investment, both in terms of steady financial gain and public health. The change will not occur overnight, but people around the world have had a taste of a future that is entirely within our grasp and need to continue to fight for long-lasting change. Slow, steady and strict implementation of regulations and tighter pollutant standards at a regional and statewide level are the key to reducing emissions locally. On a greater scale, governments should invest more money and attention into incentivizing fossil fuel-dependent industries to develop better technologies and mitigate the long-term effects of climate change.
As commerce slowly resumes and companies attempt to make up for revenue lost during the lockdown, the memory of clean skies and crisp air is still fresh in people’s minds. While the mind-numbing weeks of strict lockdown may almost be behind us, the virus has paved the way for a sliver of hope in the face of a steadily worsening climate emergency. There is no better time for environmental activism and action than the present.

For Asian Americans, it is the best of times and the worst of times. 
On one hand, there has never been a better time to be an Asian American. Asian American representation is at an all-time high, and it is no longer difficult to rattle off a slew of Asian American films, TV shows and cultural icons that have changed the public’s perception of Asians for the better. 
In a world where most of the United States’ perception of the Asian identity was informed by dehumanizing caricatures, that development is a big deal. 
On the other hand, racism and physical attacks against Asians have spread in tandem with the progression of the coronavirus. In recent months, the nation has seen a surge in xenophobic and racist incidents targeting Asian Americans. Examples of this trend exist in abundance.
In February, a woman of Chinese descent was attacked by a man in New York for wearing a mask. The man called the woman a “diseased bitch” and proceeded to beat her over the head with an umbrella. 
In March, three Asian American family members, including a 2-year-old and a 6-year-old, were stabbed at a Sam’s Club in Texas. An FBI report describing the incident stated that the suspect indicated that he attacked the family because he thought they were “Chinese and infecting people with the coronavirus.”
In April, a Chinese American man was assaulted for not wearing a mask while walking his 10-year-old son to a bus stop in Queens, N.Y. His attacker yelled “you fucking Chinese” and then attacked the man in front of his son. 
As one might expect, the situation hasn’t gotten better in May. Racist and violent crimes against Asian Americans abound, and what is perhaps the most infuriating part of the trend is that no one seems to care. Instead, many Americans appear all too eager to join in and foment the flames of anti-Asian hatred. 
Unfortunately, in the face of this bigotry, many feel helpless and unsure of how to proceed. 
Sure, a couple of paragraphs about how the government should take action (they should) may peak public interest but, in reality, that likely will not accomplish much. President Donald Trump doesn’t read the Daily Trojan, and he seems far more interested in fanning the aforementioned flames than extinguishing them, anyways. 
This lack of options leads back to an undervalued conclusion: The most significant action that can be collectively taken during this time is to settle down and take some time to learn a thing or two about Asian Americans. The grim fact of the matter is that most Americans do not know enough about Asian Americans to care about Asian Americans.
A Pew Research study is not necessary to confirm this. One only has to recall what they’ve been taught to realize that, most likely, they’ve been taught nothing about Asian Americans. 
Americans cannot think back to high school history classes in which teachers taught students about the riots, lynchings and burnings that terrorized Chinese Americans during the 19th century because those classes never took place. Most Americans cannot reference books they’ve read about the role of American cinema in forming a prevailing perception of Asians as vile and disease-ridden because those books were never assigned. 
The point of this article is not to launch into a tirade about how public education is sorely lacking Asian American studies curricula (though it is) but rather to bring light to the fact that America’s lack of collective awareness creates an environment not only ripe for anti-Asian hate crimes, but also one where few people even know or care that these crimes are occurring. 
It is unlikely that reading a book like Erika Lee’s “The Making of Asian America” is going to cure anti-Asian racism. It is also improbable that racists would recognize the error of their ways simply by watching PBS’s new five-part documentary series “Asian Americans.” However, neither of these resources are a bad place to start. 
Clearly, America has — and has always had — an anti-Asian problem. However, if Americans can’t even begin to summon the empathy necessary to learn about the issue, it seems hopelessly unlikely that it can be solved anytime soon.

Caleb Griffin is coming out from behind the camera and into the spotlight. With photography that is rooted in reality but also maintains an otherworldly aspect, Griffin, a 2020 graduate, aims to bring his own truths and the truths of others to light. 
Since childhood, Griffin has been drawn toward artistic mediums such as drawing and fashion design. Before coming to USC, Griffin attended the performing and visual arts division of the Booker T. Washington Magnet High School in Montgomery, Ala., where he concentrated on photography and saw his love for the artform bloom. 
“We spent about two hours every day in our area of interest, and mine happened to be photography from my freshman year to my senior year,” said Griffin, who majored in art with a concentration in photography. “So from me already having a love for art and fashion, it grew into photography. [I] was drawn to it because I could include so many things I liked within one medium.”
In high school, Griffin knew he wanted to pursue a career in the arts. When he arrived at USC, Griffin planned on studying graphic design because he felt that it was a viable career for an art major. However, he quickly discovered that graphic design was not his passion and returned to his first love: photography. 
“My original plan was to be a graphic designer because I figured … [it was] the easiest way to get a job while majoring in art,” Griffin said. “[But] I realized in college that I don’t like graphic design that much. So I was like, ‘OK, I’m gonna do this photography thing full speed ahead,’ and the surrounding photography was artistic direction.”
Griffin’s high school photography classes taught him a number of essential skills that have helped shape him into the photographer he is today. Under the guidance of Roski School of Art and Design’s program, based primarily on critical theory, he has continued to hone those skills.
“[I now] construct visually what I’m experiencing in my mind,” Griffin said. “Whether that is the composition or the color palette or the materiality that I’m working with … [critical theory] has helped me think critically about what the topic is and how I’m going to build the image around that topic.” 
Griffin is inspired by an array of artists, including photographers Deanna Lawson and Richard Avedon, as well as painters like Hindy Wiley. The book “Steal Like an Artist” by Austin Kleon not only taught him how to draw ideas from artists such as these without plagiarizing but also how to analyze the world around him to develop original ideas. Griffin seeks to bring out his subjects’ emotions in their entirety.
“My process is informed by ideas and emotions and how best to pack those emotions within a photo, whether that’s manipulating the pictures in some Photoshop way,” Griffin said. “Because I feel like a lot of my work teeters the line between graphic design and documentary photography, which I like. There’s a tension there. So I want that to be a part of it.”
Throughout his portfolio, many of Griffin’s main subjects are performers. He has been mesmerized by performance ever since childhood. The son of a pastor, Griffin watched his father perform for a congregation every Sunday. 
“Every Sunday made me realize why I like photographing people like in the liminal space so much of being consumed by their performance or their activity where they don’t rely on the audience at all,” Griffin said. “It’s just about them. It’s just about committing to that performance.”
But being a pastor’s son came with challenges. As a gay man, Griffin found it difficult to navigate the world he saw his father immerse himself in; wanting to escape from the societal pressures on his sexuality felt like a performance in its own right. Griffin used his photography collection “Praise Break” as a vessel to explore this tension. 
“[‘Praise Break’] was more about me trying to figure out how to engage with specific materials or specific attributes of the Black church,” Griffin said. “It definitely has let me hone in on what it feels like to be consumed by religion.” 
Some photos from the collection were taken in Griffin’s home state of Alabama, and some were taken at his apartment in Los Angeles and the Roski photography studio. This duality added a dimension to the photographs of craving religion in an unfamiliar place. 
“It was about me … feeling displaced, longing for a familiar  connection because I’m so far away from home,” Griffin said. “‘How am I about to engage with the spiritual realm that I’ve been distant from for the last three years?’”
In addition to creating his own photography, Griffin photographs a number of USC musicians. Two that Griffin photographs are USC artists Ayoni Thompson, a rising senior majoring in popular music performance, and Amir Kelly, a USC alumnus who majored in popular music performance. 
Thompson and Griffin met a few times through the music scene at USC. They first worked together in early 2019 for a casual shoot. Ever since, the two have worked on numerous other projects, where Thompson has watched Griffin work behind the camera.
“In the shoots that followed, it was very clear that he’s someone who really values just being intentional in every degree,” Thompson said. “We talk a lot about what we’re trying to accomplish [and] what we want our viewers to feel and experience and even in that first shoot, he was extremely encouraging. His intention is always just to bring you out in the best light and to just showcase people in a very beautiful and simple way.”
Kelly met Griffin in an on-campus Bible study club where they quickly became close friends. Now, Griffin serves as the creative director for Kelly’s music, having a say in every decision from the songs on Kelly’s records to the outfits he wears in Instagram posts. Watching Griffin’s growth in this role and as an artist has been extremely rewarding for Kelly.
“As he’s grown as an artist, and as I’ve been able to see more of his work, I’ve been able to see him telling his own stories,” Kelly said. “It’s so powerful to hear him stand confidently and tell his own story … I get so proud of him. Because we both started very far from where we are now but it’s a very emotional experience to watch.”
With all of his work, Griffin hopes to introduce viewers to perspectives they may have not been exposed to before and address the biases they may not have known they possessed.
“My goals as a photographer are to confront the viewer’s inherent biases as well as inform them on different aspects of life that they, for whatever privilege [or] whatever background, have not been exposed to prior,” Griffin said.

To be honest, during quarantine, I’ve spent an embarrassing amount of time staring at myself in the mirror. I’ve picked myself apart, criticizing the size of my pores and the shape of my nose, among other minor imperfections that have pervaded my day-to-day.
Though, to me, it feels like my insecurities have heightened out of the blue. I imagine it has a lot to do with the fact that stay-at-home orders have sent iPhone screen time reports through the roof. Spending more and more time on social media apps like Instagram and Snapchat has made me acutely aware of just how corrosive these platforms can be — particularly to the female psyche. Sure, that’s not a hot take by any stretch, but I feel as if I’m watching female beauty standards quickly and unforgivably move to a dangerous place.
We’re all familiar with Instagram and Snapchat filters that give you fuller lips, clearer skin and bigger eyes. The truth (whether you want to admit or not) is that many of us have or know someone who has turned to FaceTune, a photo-editing app, for a quick fix before posting a pic. And we’ve definitely all clocked other social media users for edit fails. These tools are so ubiquitous and normalized that no one bats a fake eyelash at them in the same way that cosmetic procedures like cheek fillers and lip injections have become lunch break pastimes for the professionally beautiful. Social media, photo editing apps and plastic surgery have combined forces to create a distinct cyborgian look, complete with a dark tan, catlike eyes, a cutesy ski-slope nose and full, lush lips. In the powerful words of The New Yorker, “the face is distinctly white but ambiguously ethnic” — think Kylie Jenner, Kim Kardashian, Bella Hadid and other public figure dotting Instagram’s “Explore” page. 
Simultaneously, for better or for worse, mainstream feminism has evolved to compliment rather than criticize this cultural shift. The burn-your-bra style feminism of the ’60s saw embracing the natural and rejecting the artificial (bras, curlers, high heels, etc.) as a symbol of independence from men and while I categorically reject the notion that a woman can’t be a feminist and prioritize her physical appearance, The New Yorker is not wrong that “a strain of mainstream feminism teaches women that self-objectification is progressive.” 
In 2020, many public figures are as open as they come about their plastic surgery journeys; popular YouTuber Tana Mongeau has posted a litany of videos documenting her cosmetic procedures: “Get a Face Full of Filler with Me.” “I Got a Nose Job?” and “i Got Kylie Jenner butt shots… oops (needle warning).” At this point, it is common knowledge that social media influencers lean into the plastic hard. And honestly, I’m torn about how I feel about this. On one hand, I am a huge proponent of taking control of your body and doing what feels right to you no matter what anyone thinks; whether what’s “right to you” means monthly fillers, a strict diet or nothing at all. On the other hand, I have to ask, when it comes to getting plastic surgery, where do we draw the line between “taking control of your body” and mutilating your appearance because of changing societal norms that are deceptively and insidiously imposed upon women? And how are young girls meant to tell the difference between the two? Can they?
What comes to mind is the concept of The Overton Window, a political model for understanding how ideas in society change over time and which currents of thought breach the mainstream. The Overton Window can both shift and expand, either increasing or shrinking the number of ideas politicians can support without risking electoral support. Basically, everything inside the window is fair game while everything that lies outside of it is taboo, too extreme or too far of a reach to tickle public sentiment. (Sen. Bernie Sanders, for example, managed to shift The Overton Window by normalizing socialist policies previously thought to be radical and out of the question, such as taxing the rich.)
The way I see it, the Insta-thot industrial complex — composed of the Jenners, the Kardashians, the Hadid sisters and Hailey Rhode Bieber, among many other celebrities — is shifting The Overton Window of beauty in a big (and probably harmful) way. Female beauty standards are as unattainable as ever; we are desensitized to the most invasive cosmetic procedures and the criteria for “perfection” are narrowing and homogenizing.     
These airbrushed superhumans endorse and reinforce an impossible beauty ideal with every post, on every platform, as their followers — myself included — become more accustomed and receptive to it with each passing day (not to mention the fact that this blueprint for beauty depends entirely on cultural appropriation, which is a whole other article in and of itself). So, all things considered, just how much of the plastic-surgery-positive ideology is a choice for young women growing up in this climate? 
I am writing this column because I am a woman struggling to navigate this climate, and recently — left alone with my thoughts in quarantine — I have found it quite difficult and demoralizing at times. I have contemplated nose jobs, fillers and injections, totally convinced I want them in one moment only to find myself thinking in the next, “How much of this do I really want, and how much of it is because social media is telling me that this is what ‘pretty,’ this is what ‘hot,’ looks like?”
I don’t intend to come off as superficial or judgmental — I commend those who own their decisions proudly. But I have to wonder to what extent these decisions are really “ours” and to what extent they are the direct product of insidious social norms.
