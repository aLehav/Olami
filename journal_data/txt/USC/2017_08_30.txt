Planet Mu signee Claude Speeed has emerged from seclusion once more to gift us with Infinity Ultra, an album that is as stylistically broad as it is undefinable. A Scottish native, Speeed originally began his musical career as part of “American Men,” a post-rock outfit where he allegedly traded “guitars for synths.” His presence within electronic music is sparse, having released only a few remixes and an EP since his debut album My Skeleton. 
However, having few releases does not equate to inactivity in Claude’s case: Between 2012 and 2017 he wrote 120 tracks for Infinity Ultra, of which only 15 made the cut. As a result, Infinity Ultra plays like a mix of five years’ worth of captivating musical ideas, kept together by deftly placed sonic mortar, and proves to be worth its painstaking creation.
If nothing else, Infinity Ultra is full of tonal changes. Bridled alongside its short descents into noisy chaos is an everlasting love for the emotional power of the synthesizer, used throughout the album to display apexes of hope and joy and nadirs of despair and bleakness. “XY Autostream” and “Fifth Fortress” call us back to the ’80s and ’90s respectively, using synths to foment nostalgia for the soundtracks of the Nintendo Entertainment System and Sony PlayStation, while “Entering the Zone” blends an arpeggiating synth with powerful rock drumming which recalls Phil Collins’ flair for the instrument.
Taking cues from Oneohtrix Point Never’s Eccojams Vol. 1 and Ekkehard Ehlers’ Plays, the final track, “Dreamdream,” fixates upon a loop of Katy Perry saying “dream” over and over, swelling it gradually into a saccharine anthem, worthy of the finale of a colorburnt 80s movie.
“Alternate Histories” deserves a special mention here. The track features Kuedo, a longtime collaborator of Speeed’s. Much of Kuedo’s solo work takes heavily from and focuses on deconstructing club music, which brings with it bassy rhythms and staccato hi-hats. However, this track finds him restraining those elements in favor of Speeed’s focus on anxiety and space. The track begins with a signature bass kick and cymbal, and immediately shifts to something almost resembling a meditative drum beat, interspersed with scraping metal and a faint twinkle of a synthline. Having helped Speeed perform the final cutting of the album, Kuedo’s contribution to Infinity Ultra is most heard in sparse and dissonant tracks like “Center Tech” and “Windows 95,” where his flair for dynamics and reserved, dark elements take center stage. Infinity Ultra also presents a certain aggression to the listener. The record weaves in and out of noise the way one would manually adjust a camera lens: at once blurring the picture beyond recognition, and gradually moving from soft focus into a landscape of sudden clarity. Walls of noise ebb, flow and crash in tracks like “800 Super NYC,” which bears some similarity to experimental artist Kevin Drumm’s all-enveloping and infernal noisescapes.

Although these breaks from music can register as harsh and dull, these interludes never seem without purpose. By contrast, they are carefully spaced within the record: The overamplified and muddled guitar experimentation in “Serra” presents an immediate stark divergence from the bucolic and uplifting synth tones of “BCCCC,” and “VZJD” serves as a final reminder of Speeed’s willingness to integrate unforgiving feedback and drone elements with ethereal and wispy synth lines.
With its undefinable concept and hodgepodge of ideas and stylistic influences, Infinity Ultra seems difficult to categorize nicely into the fold of modern electronic music.  Speeed has been OK with this being the case, as the album was borne of a nebulous concept and defies explanation from the artist himself. 
“It’s very difficult for me to come up with any words that really describe it,” Speeed said in an interview with Bandcamp Daily. “It’s like a lot of different elements that loosely hang together, or spin ’round the same sort of fulcrum.” 
More than anything else, Speeed desires that Infinity Ultra should speak for itself, as it should — it has a lot to say.

Shideh Ghandeharizadeh | Daily Trojan
Last Friday, President Donald Trump did the unthinkable. As a Category 4 hurricane threatened to engulf Texas, he pardoned controversial former Arizona police sheriff Joe Arpaio. 
Arpaio, who called himself “America’s Toughest Sheriff” until recently, is infamous for his long tenure as the sheriff of Maricopa County,  Arizona, where his department became known for its cruel treatment of inmates and the surrounding Latinx community. 
A federal court found that the Maricopa County Sheriff’s Office unconstitutionally carried out — in the words of one federal investigator quoted by The Atlantic — the “most egregious” example of “racial profiling in the United States” under Arpaio’s leadership. Arpaio himself was convicted of civil and criminal contempt of court when he refused to change the department’s policies. 
Make no mistake: Arpaio’s pardon is just the latest in a long line of Trump’s embrace of destructive police practices. With this latest action, Trump emboldens local law enforcement around the country to profile, discriminate against and ignore the rights of the Latinx community to fervently enforce immigration laws.
The climate created by the Trump administration is of particular relevance for the South Central Los Angeles community. The pardoning of a police sheriff famous for using racial profiling to illegally attack the rights of immigrants sends a dark message to immigrants throughout Los Angeles. Trump’s decision could embolden the law enforcement officers in the community who may have vendettas against immigrants by telling them that they are above the law, and racially charged and illegal action or excessive use of force by police can be pardoned and even condoned.
Latinx people constitute roughly half of the community — thousands of whom are undocumented. In Los Angeles, condoning racially discriminatory policies would be widely felt. The city has already started to feel the brunt of Trump’s policies, with increased ICE raids and a Justice Department threatening to cut millions in federal funding over its refusal to comply with federal immigration policy. In May, more than 200 undocumented people were arrested in Los Angeles.
Trump’s decision was instantly denounced by people from across the political spectrum, from former Democratic presidential candidate Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) to Sen. John McCain (R-AZ). It is comforting to know that many in positions of political power are able to see the pardon for what it is: a short-sighted maneuver to appeal to the president’s ever-shrinking base of support. But those who disavow the president’s actions must be careful to note that it is not an isolated incident. 
The president’s words about race and policing hold heavy weight. They embolden seeds of racism that may already exist in some law enforcement officers across the country, from Ferguson, Mo., to South Central Los Angeles.
In June 2015, Trump broke into the political scene with lurid descriptions of “rapists” and “murderers” flooding across the border from Mexico. He has yet to moderate his rhetoric during his time in office. Trump has consistently and disturbingly espoused a violent, triumphalist and deeply out-of-touch view of policing. 
In a speech to law enforcement officials this July, for example, he referred to MS-13 gang members as “animals” before endorsing the use of causal police brutality. In particular, he verbally supported the “rough rides” responsible for the death of Freddie Gray at the hands of the Baltimore Police Department.
The new status quo that Trump has created by his outrageous statements and actions causes real harm and mistrust in the real world. In the process, only the gangs benefit.
To function, local law enforcement needs the support of and cooperation from the communities they serve. If undocumented and recent immigrants fear they may be deported, they may be less likely to report crimes or talk with the police. 
With less crime being reported, gangs are able to get away with more brazen activity. A vicious cycle is created, where immigrant communities have no place to turn for help. In the past, even strict immigration policy has benefited gangs. MS-13 as we know it today was formed due to mass deportations in the 1990s, which enabled the gang to establish international roots.
The good news is that, despite the grim picture on the federal level, law enforcement in Los Angeles still shows some promise. The Los Angeles Police Department, in the process of reform themselves, came out strongly against Trump’s remarks. LAPD Chief Charlie Beck, during a recent speech to Senate Democrats, went as far as to say “we are all less safe” with more extreme immigration enforcement. They understand the danger these policies pose to public safety.
At the end of the day, Trump’s pardon of Arpaio is only the latest action to display his administration’s disregard for the Latinx community and policing procedure as a whole. But nonetheless, to South Central Los Angeles’ prominent Latinx and immigrant community, this sends a uniquely dangerous message.
You know what REALLY affects Los Angeles? Decades of illegal immigration by largely unskilled, uneducated and illiterate foreigners.
Pardoning Joe Arpaio will hopefully affect freeway drive times in LA – fewer illegal immigrants on the road means fewer hours wasted in traffic.
By the way – being “Latinx” doesn’t preclude one from obeying the immigration laws of a sovereign nation state.
Neither Joe Arpaio or the millions of illegal immigrants in our country should be pardoned. When you commit a crime you need to do the time.
I couldn’t agree more…. but how often does someone do the full time for their crime.  The difference is that Arpaio was convicted of a misdemeanor and has a clean record…. unlike the thousands of FELONS that obama pardoned…. They ALL have extensive records and have been given a second chance… third chance.. forth… 100th chance, etc.  Anyone else that committed the same crime that Arpaio committed, would receive probation and not jail time.
Obama pardons a terrorist bomber and cop killer along with commuting the sentences of countless violent drug dealers and you harp on about a sheriff enforcing immigration laws that may not be PC?  Take a breath. Remind yourself that you are another of the throng that made up its mind to be hateful more than a year ago.
May I suggest that you do research beyond chats at Starbucks to support conclusions on socio-economic policy.
Completely agree!
So you were ok with the thousands of pardons Obama ordered?

Last week, pop sensation Taylor Swift’s return to social media and the music industry sparked an internet avalanche and inspired a wave of think pieces both criticizing and celebrating her. All evidence from the artist’s social media, as well as the lyrics and music video of her newly released single, “Look What You Made Me Do,” indicate that the album will tell the story of a woman empowered by her “haters” — who range from celebrities like reality star Kim Kardashian West and her husband Kanye West, to a media that’s been obsessed with her since the 2000s. The new Taylor Swift of reputation is one who reclaims the hateful, misogyny-laced narrative that’s followed her for close to a decade — a Taylor Swift who slashes previous feminine, starry-eyed versions of herself to pieces.
Since the moment the single dropped last Friday, pop culture pundits have been zealous in their hyper-analysis of Swift and her lyrics, and have come to some very different conclusions. Where BuzzFeed is celebrating Swift as a feminist hero, Slate is blasting her new style for being grudge-fueled and melodramatic. 
Both of these arguments are ridden with their own sets of flaws: In criticizing Swift for having the audacity to express her emotions, Slate is, however inadvertently, playing into the societal narrative of sexism that Swift is criticizing in her music. But in the same vein, in the age of Ivanka Trump — a time when words and verbal declarations of feminism from wealthy, privileged white women increasingly ring hollow — BuzzFeed’s appraisal of Swift as a rising feminist phoenix is equally frustrating.
At a time when women in the United States are suffering from the highest maternal mortality rates in the industrialized world, when our elected political leaders seem determined to tell Muslim, undocumented and trans women that this is not their America, celebrity feminism can no longer exist merely as a marketing ploy. Affluent white women who identify as feminists and wear the movement as a label to sell everything from clothing lines to, in Swift’s case, music can’t just speak out only when feminism concerns them as individuals and can be used to promote their brands.
Deena Baum | Daily Trojan
Feminism is an intersectional movement for the equality of all groups. It can’t be selectively deployed to advance rich, married white women like Ivanka Trump’s maternal leave plan does, or, like Swift’s social media and music, to shield oneself from criticism and mean comments while turning a blind eye to the racism, misogyny and intolerance that other, less privileged Americans face every day. 
To be sure, Swift and her fans are right about one thing — much of the criticism she faces is sexist. For years, Swift has been trolled and attacked for being a young woman and having the nerve to date men. Feminists can both sympathize with Swift for the misogyny she’s faced, and also criticize her for being silent and apathetic at a time when silence and apathy only serve to normalize and embolden bigotry. Where pop artist Katy Perry actively campaigned for former Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton, and R&B artist Rihanna called for young people to vote — and vote for Clinton, at that — Swift maintained an unapologetic radio silence on politics.
Few Americans have platforms as far-reaching as Swift’s. That’s precisely why silence from “feminists” like her doesn’t just speak volumes — it also reverberates throughout social media. She has profited immensely from wearing the “feminist” label, as this particular moment in our nation’s history is one in which millions of millennial women have made the once widely stigmatized feminist movement their home. Interviews with Swift prior to 2014 reveal she certainly wasn’t interested in the movement before recognizing that aligning herself with it was economically advantageous. 
At the end of the day, it’s one thing to not care about today’s political dialogue — already a disappointing stance at a time when challenges to health care, if successful, could cost thousands of poor, old and sick Americans their lives. But it’s a darker, more innocuous feat entirely to claim to care about and be part of a movement to empower the marginalized and market your brand through doing so, and then be silent at a political moment when your star and influence are needed most. 
Among both liberals and conservatives, many have always agreed that music, sports and entertainment should be politics-free zones to avoid desecrating art with conflict and petty squabbles. Following this argument, celebrities like Swift have no obligation to speak out and be activists, and shouldn’t be criticized for silence. 
But this line of thinking emerges from a different era. Today, the line between politics and human decency is becoming increasingly blurred. It’s impossible to recognize politics as just politics when our national political dialogue is discussing whether the state should be allowed to force low-income women to give birth, and whether minorities and LGBTQ people have a right to equal treatment. Silence on “politics” from people with wide-reaching platforms has become just about impossible to justify — least of all from people who profit from claiming to be feminist.

Success in the pool hasn’t stopped for three Trojans who took home new hardware from Taipei at the 2017 World University Games this weekend. The women’s water polo team was well represented at the annual championships, with recent graduate Brigitta Games taking home a gold medal for the United States.
Trojans faced off against each other throughout the Games. Senior Hayley McKelvey saw action in the pool with the Canadian team, which fell to the United States in the quarterfinals. The team won its final two games in the tournament to stay alive and take fifth overall.
The finals pitted Games against former teammate Flora Bolonyai, who graduated from USC in 2013 and played in goal for Hungary at the tournament. The Americans took home the victory with a high-scoring 16-9 victory, headlined by Stanford alumni Kiley and Jamie Neushul. Bolonya took home silver along with the rest of the Hungarian team.
During the tournament, McKelvey notched seven goals across eight games played with the Canadians. She served up two goals in the team’s fifth-place victory over Australia. Games had her biggest showing against Italy, netting three goals in the team’s victory. She finished the tournament with a total of six goals, scoring a critical goal in the semifinals against Japan.
In the net, Bolonyai racked up 19 total saves over the course of eight games of action. She knocked away six saves in the team’s quarterfinal victory over France and five in the semifinals against Russia.
Each of the Trojans featured in the tournament won NCAA championships during their time at USC. Bolonyia took home NCAA MVP honors in 2013 after leading her team to an overtime national championship victory. Games and McKelvey played side-by-side to secure the team’s 2016 NCAA championship.

Emily Smith | Daily Trojan
On Tuesday, the Trojans had what head coach Clay Helton called “one of our best [practices] of the entire camp.” In the first practice leading up to their opening game against Western Michigan, the Trojan coaching staff emphasized speed and tempo. With preparation as a key going into every matchup, Helton shouted  “win the game today” at his players as they team stretched and warmed up. 
Not taking the Broncos lightly 
After starting the 2016 season with a bruising loss to perennial powerhouse Alabama, USC has a much more forgiving opener. Although the Broncos are coming off of a 13-win season in which they went to the Iron Bowl, they’ve lost former head coach PJ Fleck and All-American wide receiver Corey Davis. While Western Michigan can’t compare to Alabama, Helton knows that the Trojans can’t take any team lightly. Helton emphasized that Western Michigan still has a considerable amount of talent returning. 
“They have everything you need to go win an away game,” Helton said. “Pack your run game, pack your defense, and pack great special teams. This is a very dangerous team and we’ll have to play our best to compete with them.” 
Reality check 
As the Trojans take the field for the first time this season, many players will be making their collegiate debut. These first reps in a real game will be an opportunity for coaches to analyze which players are truly prepared to perform at a high level.
“This is really a reality check for us to see where we are.Everybody has great, high expectations for us and it’s neat to see as a coach exactly where you are after this first game,” Helton said. “How are these 24 newcomers going to react? How are the kids that we redshirted last year, where are they at now? That’s kind of the unknown. I’m really excited to see the young people and how they can help this football team.”
Shuffling the Receivers
With several options at wideout, Helton talked about how he plans to rotate them. While the depth chart lists three starters — juniors Deontay Burnett, Steven Mitchell and Jalen Greene — the Trojans are deep at the position. 
“They really showed their experience in training camp, the expectations of what practice should look like, what execution should look like, what repeating it should look like,” offensive coordinator Tee Martin said.
While the Trojans have experience, they also have young talent on the roster that’s ready to contribute. 
“The competition, the depth, the type of talent, the variety of talent that we have, it makes for a balanced room and I really like what we have,” Martin said. “We’re going to play seven or eight guys a game. We preach quality of reps over quantity of reps. I’d rather have a fresh 40 [plays] than a tired 80.”
Helton must manage his stable of wideouts come Saturday. As far as rotations go, Helton said that in a no-huddle offense, coaches are relatively hands off.
 “To start off the game we’re going to go with experience and then we will [use] that youth in this game as well as all games,” Helton said. “They control themselves. In a no-huddle offense you’re always keeping an eye on your teammates. They have a buddy, they watch their buddy and if they raise their hand they’re ready to go.”
Message to Houston 
Helton opened his press conference by addressing the devastation caused by Hurricane Harvey throughout Texas. 
“Our thoughts and prayers are with the great city of Houston, Texas and everyone in South Texas that has gone through that hurricane,” Helton said. “I have friends and family down there and hearing the tales of how horrific it is right now, our thoughts and prayers are with them right now.” 
Injury Report 
Helton anticipates senior offensive guard Viane Talamaivao will be ready for Saturday. Redshirt sophomore tight end Daniel Imatorbhebhe was limited on Tuesday and Helton will update his status later in the week. Sophomore wide receiver Michael Pittman is doubtful for Saturday’s game. Sophomore wide receiver Keyshawn “Pie” Young is nursing a hamstring injury and his status will be determined later in the week.

On Saturday night, pretty much all of America was tuned into one event — Mayweather vs. McGregor, a massive money-grab of a fight that was hyped to be one of the greatest sporting events of the decade for months leading up to its ultimate climax this weekend.
I had looked forward to the fight for weeks until I discovered that it was unfortunately positioned on the final night of sorority recruitment. Despite trying my hardest to make it to a viewing party, I ended up relying on Snapchats from my best friend to keep up with the fight and its 10 rounds of drama.
But ultimately, I wasn’t disappointed in missing out on what at one point was predicted to be one of the greatest superfights of all time. The recaps betrayed the truth of the matchup — a veteran facing an energetic but underprepared rookie who, despite all of his outside training, was not a match for a long-standing boxing champion.
As a casual fan of boxing, the night was disappointing to me. It was certainly one of the biggest nights in fighting in years. Yet something rang hollow about the experience as a whole. Call me an idealist, but Mayweather vs. McGregor just didn’t feel like boxing to me.
I probably didn’t get into boxing for all of the right reasons. My mom is a huge fan of the Rocky movies, and she convinced me to watch them the “perfect way” — Rocky I and II back-to-back with no break, as if it’s a full movie — as a freshman in college. 
Shortly afterwards, Creed came out and my love of fake-movie-boxing was cemented after the 133 minutes of that unbelievably quotable movie. Sure, it’s not the real thing, but the movie lent me a certain appreciation of the sport that I’d never had before. 
I used to see boxing as a grotesque sport, an even more brutal form of football with its unrelenting violence. But watching those movies, as fake as they are, gave me an appreciation of boxing and boxers and the fans who watch it. 
It took coming to USC, joining a recreational boxing gym and making several close friends who were fans of fighting for me to be completely won over. But as I continued to watch more of the sport, I came to appreciate the intricacies and techniques that set each boxer apart. Fighters are a certain type of dancer; no two people fight the same, and the ring is a stage for the most basic type of physical competition.
The hard part of loving boxing, though, is that the sport as a whole is dying out. This has been said for decades, and it’s also been true for decades. The death of boxing has been a slow one, but it’s been a steady degradation, as a society increasingly sensitive towards brutality in athletics shifts to the NBA and the MLS and away from so-called “traditional” American sports.
Now, boxing is successful only on the grandest stages. Fewer and fewer boxers can “make it,” and the result is a sport that thrives off of spectacles such as the one on Saturday night. I heard plenty of people describe the match as a “good fight” in class on Monday. 
To be fair, it wasn’t a bad fight like Mayweather’s previous bout against Manny Pacquiao that disappointed casual and avid fans alike. But I don’t think Saturday’s fight can be remembered as a great fight by any means. It was a spectacle of an event and a major money-making move for both fighters, but the action wasn’t anything to write home about.
In several weeks, one fight has the potential to be a truly spectacular fight — Canelo vs. GGG, a face off between Canelo Álvarez and Gennady Golovkin on Sept. 16 that pits two of the best middleweight boxers in the world.
That fight will be everything that the Mayweather vs. McGregor fight wasn’t. Both fighters are equally matched, with a slight advantage given to Álvarez, who has only been beaten by Mayweather earlier in his career. But this is an example of an actual superfight, in which two top-ranked fighters take on the greatest challenge in their division.
That match will be a true fight. It also won’t receive half the hype or attention. It won’t be a national event, even though it is truly and indisputably a better matchup and a more interesting fight. This is the rub of modern boxing — the superfights aren’t the mainstage anymore, and much of the hype revolves around names rather than quality.
It’s hard to proclaim the sport dead when a single fight night generated $400 million. The interest for boxing is certainly still available, and if properly directed, it could bring some life back into the sport. But it’s hard to refocus any fanbase once it’s gone so far off its original track.
I’m not calling for an overhaul of the sport. One of the greatest parts of boxing is its glitz and glamor, and I will stand behind the belief that Prince Naseem Hased’s entrance into the ring on a magic carpet is one of the coolest things to happen in the history of sports. Every great boxing match deserves the pageantry of the weigh in, the walk-up music and the trash talking.
But in order to keep boxing alive, we need to go back to the basics. A stunt like Saturday’s match is short-lived, and the fun dies quickly and leaves few memories. Boxing will stay fun if the biggest fights are the best ones, not the ones with the biggest price tag attached.

Everything was planned. Gina Luciani was ready to take a camping trip. However, after one phone conversation, she decided to cut the trip short after receiving an offer to play the famous flute solo on the hit song “Down Under” with Colin Hay of Men at Work for ABC’s nationally televised Greatest Hits.
In the shows, musicians performing with the band would typically be placed in the background and only appear on camera for a few seconds. However, nearly an entire week’s worth of preparation paid off for Luciani. The recording crew asked her to walk to the center of the stage during the song’s instrumental solo and let her know which two cameras would be filming her, as she was to be broadcast frequently during the televised program. If Luciani had not cut her camping trip short, this opportunity would have gone to someone else. 
Luciani’s intense passion for music has driven her impressive career. When she was 4 years old, her favorite movie was The Little Mermaid. She wanted to know what instrument Prince Eric played. Even though the instrument in the movie was a fife, the closest instrument her mother could think of was the flute, which Luciani has been playing ever since.
Music brought Luciani to Los Angeles where she attended the Colburn Conservatory of Music for her bachelor’s degree and USC for her master’s degree. She is now a recording artist for various mediums, such as film, television and video games. Some notable projects she has performed in include: Straight Outta Compton, League of Legends, Halo Wars 2, Planet Earth II, Penny Dreadful and Chef’s Table. Luciani also made appearances in High School Musical 3, Glee and Teen Wolf.
The flutist has been featured on many stages aside from her gig with Colin Hay — one of her favorite performances of all time. The opportunities are so numerous that she has difficulty pinpointing one as her favorite. However, playing at the Music Center with famed composer John Williams was a highlight. Another memorable show was playing with the Wu Tang Clan at the Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival.
Luciani creates music for composers around the world, leading her to offer remote recordings. This is beneficial to L.A. composers who have to meet a short deadline and do not have time to set up a recording session at a studio. In addition,  it allows her to work for clients no matter where they are. Remote recording requires Luciani to be not only the musician, but also the recording engineer. Providing this unique service has led her to work on diverse projects ranging from pop songs to film soundtracks.
Two months ago, Luciani decided to display her flute skills to a broader audience when she began uploading her own arrangements of movie and television themes, a genre of music that she is passionate about, on her  self-titled YouTube channel. 
Because a flute can only play one line, she included all the accompaniment in her covers with various screens of her playing different parts with multiple flutes from a collection of over 100 traditional and ethnic flutes that she owns. Actors and composers for the respective films and shows, like Up or House of Cards, have responded to her covers and have even shared them.
While anyone can use her YouTube channel to find tutorials on topics aimed at musicians and flutists, she also provides lessons through her one-on-one Skype lessons, enabling her to instruct students from many different countries. Luciani recalls having to travel to musicians or wait until they were touring nearby so she could have a lesson with them when she was younger. Now, people can find her on social media or contact her through her website.
Luciani has also gained a substantial following on her Instagram, Facebook and Twitter accounts. She made her Instagram public for her professional career about two years ago and her account has since grown to over 24,000 followers. One of Luciani’s favorite things about utilizing social media is that she can connect with anyone from anywhere in the world. She also loves that music can bring people together, regardless of their backgrounds, beliefs or other affiliations.
Although Luciani aims to post photos or videos daily, she still displays strong artistic integrity. 
“Of course, it would be easier to produce more content than I’m currently doing if I didn’t maintain the quality, and it would probably boost my numbers,” she said. “Ultimately I would rather sacrifice numbers over quality.”
However, social media is not the only hobby that Luciani partakes in aside from flute playing. She has utilized her love of design to start selling merchandise including an instrument cleaning cloth that she co-designed with a British company. Because classical music has been seen as old and dated, she wanted her brand to be fresh and fun. She put in so much effort that she is close to creating her own music lifestyle brand, which she hopes to launch this spring.
Luciani  continues to give back to the USC community in spite of her busy career schedule. This year marks her second year on the USC Alumni Association Board of Governors. She has also served on the Thornton School of Music Alumni Advisory Council since 2013.
When she was studying to earn her Master of Music at USC, professor Jim Walker inspired her the most out of all her peers and professors. In fact, Luciani cites Walker as a catalyst to her career.
“His career encompasses recording, performing, teaching, publishing his own music and much more,” she said. “I think every musician should model their career after his by having many aspects to their career and not putting all their eggs in one basket.”
With an impressive number of performances and upcoming projects, from the recently released “Birth of the Dragon” to Alexander Payne’s Downsizing, Gina Luciani has had an accomplished career as a flutist and her decision to follow Walker’s career model has proven to be conducive to her success.

In many respects, the progression of a successful career in music is marked by change. Many great artists evolve and adjust their instrumentation, tone and possibly even genre in the process of discerning their creative identity. 
For Philadelphia rocker Adam Granduciel and his band The War on Drugs, this creative breakthrough came with their 2015 album Lost in the Dream. But The War on Drugs’ new project, A Deeper Understanding, is the product of a band looking to expand upon an established, discovered musical identity. It is a testament to Granduciel’s evolution as a student of his own craft and a figure in rock music.
Granduciel’s songwriting contains obvious nods to classic and psychedelic rock in The War on Drugs’ discography. The comparisons to Bruce Springsteen and Tom Petty are as warranted as they are numerous. The authenticity and introspection of folk music mixed with Brian Eno’s ambient production give The War on Drugs an edge suited for today’s rock scene. Granduciel is a jack-of-all-trades: singer, songwriter, guitarist and sound engineer.
The War on Drugs’ past records found an identity in instrumental onslaughts that one would typically find on an early Sonic Youth track. Tracks like “Red Eyes” and “An Ocean in Between the Waves” from Lost in the Dream possess musical grandeur that only builds on itself through each song. The incredibly diverse musical arrangements and effortless self-reflection are the reasons these songs sound as monumental as they do. While Kurt Vile provided an element of folk and improvisation, it is Granduciel’s ambitious songwriting and embrace of the studio that has propelled the band into the music of today.
Embracing this identity, The War on Drugs goes for the home run in the instrumentally epic “Strangest Thing,” a true showcase of Granduciel’s emotive chord progressions. The record’s focus on detail is a testament to Granduciel’s inner Brian Wilson as a studio perfectionist. Every melody, lyric and progression on A Deeper Understanding is a product of an undaunted work ethic and frequent experimentation. Even at the album’s relatively lower points, Granduciel’s detail-oriented approach to recording leaves the listener awestruck.

Undoubtedly, the band’s greatest strength lies in Granduciel’s understanding of the power of the unexplainable. The War on Drugs’ songs give no hint where they will go next, which makes the 66-minute project feel much shorter. The tendency to get lost listening the record has been a trademark of the band’s success.
This ambient effect that permeates in the band’s music culminates in the dreamy ballad “Thinking of a Place.” The song’s progression feels like two distinct songs seamlessly molded together by their mysterious nature. The first half of the song slowly builds its ambient instrumentation as if the subject is thinking before the ambitious second half poses a resolution to the first. 
It is easy to compare Granduciel’s songwriting to that of Neil Young’s on this track. Granduciel, however, is not Young; his grasp of the power of the studio is much more apparent than that of his idol’s.
Comparisons aside, The War on Drugs establishes independence from its influences from the offset. The band may not transcend the genre’s direction as a whole, but it is undoubtedly refining it in ways very few can. With frontman Adam Granduciel at the helm, The War on Drugs is confident in its direction. Granduciel’s vision, for now, is deeply understood.

Lately, I’ve been thinking a lot about identity. From my public speaking class requiring an introductory speech to my communication professor assigning an autobiographical essay, this semester thus far has brought a bevy of forces all pushing me to confront the conundrum of self. I completed both tasks by presenting cookie-cutter synopses of my 19 years — my background, passions and ambitions all conveniently rolled up in a neat little package. I willingly allowed myself to be reduced to a list of circumstantial details that barely scratched the metaphorical surface of my identity as I recited mundane facts about myself: “I am a sophomore majoring in communication. I grew up in a suburb of Washington, D.C. I hope to go to law school.” 
But that’s not me. What I didn’t reveal to my classmates — due to deadlines, rubrics and the general rules of human interaction — is that I am so much more. 
I am a notorious memory hoarder, with old concert tickets, business cards and Polaroids overflowing my desk drawer. I am double jointed in a way that tends to gross people out. I am an indomitable overachiever and, consequently, a perpetual ball of stress. I am a vegetarian with flexible morals. I am a living, breathing hot mess of neuroses and insecurities. I am an editor, an intern, a friend, a girlfriend, a sister, a daughter.
The most recent identity I have had to accept, however, is that I am a child of divorce. This is a trait many of my peers tout but it isn’t a label I thought I would ever have to bear. 
A mere week before I jetted off to the West Coast to start my sophomore year, my parents blindsided my brother and I with their plans to separate and divorce. I never quite understood how the atmosphere of a room could be so thick you can feel it, but in that moment, breathing was truly an endeavor on par with suffocation. I remember the heat in my cheeks and the pounding of blood in my brain more vividly than I can recall my father’s carefully crafted rhetoric. He did his best to say all the right words and to let me and my brother know that we were deeply loved and completely blameless. In later, private conversations with both parents, I was enlightened of a secret past of infidelities, mental health issues and financial troubles that will forever change the way I see them and myself. 
Growing up in a Chinese-American household, I naively fancied myself immune to the trials and tribulations that afflicted divorced families. True to cultural roots, my parents were not the most affectionate people, especially toward each other, but I learned from an early age to accept the distance in their relationship as a version of normalcy — a sort of tacit, mutual love and understanding. As long as we lived under the same roof and ate our home-cooked dinners together every night, everything would be OK. As long as I played the role of model-minority firstborn and fulfilled my parents’ American Dream by proxy, life would be perfect, right? Wrong.
For days, I was overcome with guilt at the news of my parents’ separation. However unwarranted and illogical, I felt that I was to blame for not being a better person. Why did I cause them so much stress when I rebelled in high school? Why didn’t I choose a less financially burdensome, public university closer to home? Why didn’t I notice sooner? Why didn’t I do something to stop this? Why did this happen to us? 
In addition to the responsibilities and stresses of school, the weight of this profound and unexpected change weighs heavily on my heart, even though I am thousands of miles from home. I think of my little brother entering the hardships of his junior year of high school, my mother now as a single parent and my father alone in an unfurnished apartment, and I am overcome with hopeless longing for the life I once knew, now a bygone era. 
But eventually, as all things must, these feelings came to pass. Since the initial shock, I have spent a few sleepless nights and a few weeks cramming my schedule full of distractions to come to terms with the situation. I came out the other side with a strong sense of self and purpose — a new take on my identity. 
I know that I am by no means the first person to lose a family to divorce, but I am the first to lose my family, and that makes all the difference. 
But in spite of all this, I have close friends to confide in, a boyfriend who makes me his number one priority, a new job and classes I love. And, only a plane ride away, I still have my family. This family is far from over, and I will continue to do everything in my capacity to give them all endless reasons to be proud of me. I know that my parents made a rational, civil decision and that we will be grateful for it in the long run. The tough months ahead are simply a period of transition, toward a new equilibrium where everything will be different but everything will ultimately be OK. 
I am equal parts dog person and cat person, despite being mildly allergic to both. I am a lover of contemporary art. I am vaguely trilingual. And, in a new twist on my identity and everything I thought I was, I am a child of divorce.

Earlier this month, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported that rates of mental health struggles and severe depression in teens have steadily risen over the last 40 years.
There are many potential reasons teenage suicide rates may be on the rise — namely more rigorous academic and professional pressures — but social media and its powerful, sometimes dangerous hold on American youth are also powerful factors in the equation. Social media’s omnipresence reaps profoundly negative consequences for all. And while social progress has inched forward in recent years, social media still tends to promote unattainable standards and hurtful stereotypes. 
The Royal Society for Public Health, a United Kingdom-based charity and research institute, released a study in May measuring the costs and benefits of using social media. What it found was unsurprising: Platforms such as Instagram and Facebook reliably produce negative effects for a significant portion of their users. Half of the study’s respondents reported escalating feelings of anxiety from the use of Instagram and Facebook. And Instagram was found to produce the most negative effects. Seventy percent of respondents reported feeling less confident with their body images when using Instagram. 
Body image issues transcend the surface and contribute to mental health issues, such as depression and, for young women, eating disorders. A 2014 University of Pittsburgh study, which surveyed over 1,700 adults between the ages of 19 and 32 highlights the sharp, undeniable correlation between excessive social media use and eating disorders. The study concluded that those who check their social media accounts the most often on a daily basis are more than twice as likely to develop eating disorders. 
Some of the mental health issues that spring at least in part from high social media consumption are exacerbated to the point that people take their own lives. And the unique relationship between young people and social media, which has risen to be a more dominant force in their lifetimes than for any other generation, comes at a time that suicide claims the lives of more young women between the ages of 15 and 19 years than any other cause of death, according to the National Institute of Health. This disheartening reality is often overshadowed by misogynistic stereotypes, one of which mischaracterizes female suicidality as a ploy for attention. We must have zero tolerance for this kind of rhetoric, as it is a masked attempt to brush an important problem aside.
These higher rates of mental health issues among today’s youth can have resounding consequences. Though there is no evidence of a direct correlation between mental health issues stemming from social media usage and suicide, the startling increase in teen suicides in recent years brings another dimension to the mental health conversation among adolescents. From 2007 to 2015, 10.8 to 14.2 per 100,000 male teenagers committed suicide, and 2.4 to 5.1 per 100,000 female teenagers committed suicide. In 2011, for the first time in more than two decades, more teenagers died from suicide than from homicide. And on college campuses, 2016 data from the American Foundation for Suicide Prevention showed that one in 12 college students will develop a plan for suicide. 
A study from the Oregon Health and Science University suggests that face-to-face interaction can play a role in countering depression, and could be one part of the solution to mental health disorders stemming from excessive social media use. Ultimately, while broad societal issues such as this one do not have instant cures, awareness of such issues and their nuances and, more than anything, awareness of the resources available to suffering people, are the best starting point. 
USC Engemann Student Health Center offers counseling services to students on and off campus, and many campus organizations and student groups provide similar services and support. One substantial obstacle to improving mental health and lowering rates of teen suicide is ensuring that students know their options, and it’s crucial that USC and all universities broadcast and educate about the resources they offer as much as they can. Ironically enough, social media could be one way to powerfully boost these efforts.

It’s commonly believed that if people read the fine print, they can avoid a lot of trouble. For college students and their families, though, reading the fine print doesn’t change much at all. Student fees, the fine print on college tuition bills that can fund student unions and scholarships, have begun to include large costs for technology fees in recent years. 
Last week, the Washington Post explored the role played by technology and growing dependence on it education’s in increasing student costs. Student fees, the Post reports, have grown faster than tuition since 2000. With more and more of this fast-growing fee allocated toward technology advancements at universities nationwide, a careful consideration of the distribution of student fees, and the true benefits of technology, is crucial. The advances in technology from student fees, which are widely praised for being constructive in higher education, are in many cases just making higher education more expensive. In order to support all students, higher education institutions like USC must devise a balanced plan by tightening spending on classroom technology, in order to best allocate the student fee budget. 
Much of the research on technology’s role in education focuses on early education, with split arguments about what technology does to a child’s cognitive development, while the research on technology’s role in higher education is less divided. The concerns of researchers studying technology in higher education are often unified: Technology increases distractibility. The use of e-textbooks, for example, has been shown to create challenges in fostering extended engagement, deep-thinking and self-monitoring in students. While there are certainly benefits to technology in college classrooms, few of them are unique to technology itself. The commonly perceived benefits of increasing the use of technology budgets in higher education, such as interest in course material, cultural relevance or new platforms for learning, can be replicated with solid teaching, student engagement and classroom dialogue — all stalwarts of a strong educational setting anyway. 
Not only are there drawbacks to increasing technology in classrooms, such as the aforementioned lack of unique benefits and increased distractibility, but also, USC students already have to spend a considerable amount on technology that is not included in student fees to be competitive. Students at all schools within the University often have to spend considerable fees on online attendance platforms, like Top Hat, or are required to buy supplemental e-book materials for their already expensive physical textbooks. 
It’s almost impossible to attend the University for four years without, in one way or another, spending personal funds on technology for schoolwork. Therefore, channeling student fees to increased development in technology is simply a repetitive burden for students already paying steep prices for technology. 
What’s more, using student fees for technological developments may take away money from other programs, also funded by student fees, that truly help the University grow and support its students. For example, every semester, $8 from each student’s mandatory student fee goes toward maintaining the Norman Topping Student Aid Fund which assists students with high financial need and extraordinary community awareness in pursuing their education at USC. Programs like the Norman Topping Student Aid Fund, which inarguably benefit the USC community, could be better served if student fees were re-allocated to de-emphasize technology developments. Student fees are not inherently wasteful or burdensome, and if the University is more transparent and better prioritizes where these fees go — less to unnecessarily high-end technology and more to philanthropic causes — all students will benefit from this.
As student fees continue to grow rapidly nationwide, USC will put itself ahead of the curve if its administration sees the value in funneling fees that might be distributed to increased technology efforts into other programs at the University. In fact, the move might be more cutting-edge than any development in technology ever could be. 
 
I have a hard time understanding the broad use of the term, “technology” in this article and why students should pay less for it? For example, why are e-books the target of pernicious tech cost? Are e-book more expensive than analog paper books? The article does not say and it is not clear if the author is against e-books or books in general as a cost cutting measure.
High school is over and in college you should be treated as an adult. You have to make choices with your money. You can invest in your education or not. No one said college should feel like a free 4 year vacation at Shangri-La. 
Is the author saying let’s not use the internet and go instead to the library to check out books when you have to do any research? Where are the potential cost savings this author seeks?

Shideh Ghandeharizadeh | Daily Trojan
Last Friday, the New Yorker published a conversation between editor-in-chief David Remnick and Columbia University professor Mark Lilla — who is best known, in recent memory, for his opinion piece titled “The End of Identity Liberalism” published in The New York Times 10 days after President Donald Trump won the election. Lilla is a scholar of the humanities, who writes books about the intellect and history. So what, particularly, about liberals and their identities makes him so set against them? 
In his New York Times piece, Lilla writes that identity politics is why the Democratic Party and Hillary Clinton lost. Identity politics mean, to Lilla’s dismay, a focus on individual and diverse groups within the great American patchwork quilt — a bad thing, according to him, because “if you are going to mention groups in America, you had better mention all of them.” 
And yet, in a political climate where issues of campus free speech are coming to a head, Lilla’s words feel like what critics of student activism mean when they say everyone’s voice — the diverse, American student body and hateful speakers, including Ann Coulter and Milo Yiannopoulos, who spread discriminatory beliefs — deserve equal weight. It feels like what Trump meant when he equated the neo-Nazis with those who marched for tolerance and inclusion in Charlottesville. And for marginalized students across the country, it feels once more as if they are being told that their urgent concerns hold equal weight with the ideals of those who refuse to see them as full people. 
What’s dangerous about Lilla is that he doesn’t view a dialogue about America’s marginalized identities as important or necessary. He thinks those are hindrances in the way of political unity, and this bleeds into a more insidious and generalized approach to how conservatives talk about minorities involved in political discourse in this country: that minorities are wrong to fight over the politics that define their very livelihoods, that they are exaggerating when they decry discriminatory rhetoric and legislation, and that they have it no harder than anyone else. That is why white supremacists continue to rally around the so-perceived crusade of free speech, believing that being held accountable to hateful speech hurts just as much as having rights, resources and safety legally taken away.
To be clear, everyone uses identity politics — not just Democrats. Trump does when he targets discourse and legislation on needs specific and exclusive to white citizens, and so do liberal-minded Americans who ask for focus on causes specific toward women, groups of people of color, and the like. Where this goes wrong is what happens when each side believes the other isn’t seeing the full picture, and the frenzied noise of the left and right’s collective echo chambers escalates to an inescapable pitch. 
What’s key, at this point, is to listen. And yet, who must listen to whom?
Simply put, when it comes to politics governing the identity of marginalized groups, it’s not enough to be bipartisan, or nonpartisan or even apolitical. For marginalized communities, identity politics surpasses politics — choices made in Washington not only affect their financial circumstances, but are inherent to what it means to live as a minority or a woman or a disabled person or a member of the LGBTQ community today. Really, to these groups “identity politics” is exactly what it sounds like — a threatening prospect where political decisions are inseparable from who they are fundamentally.
When so much is at stake, for marginalized groups and others like them, rhetoric about what Americans all have in common feels like white conservatives asserting that “All Lives Matter” is the same thing as “Black Lives Matter.” It gets the country nowhere. If an entire side of the political sphere refuses to understand or even acknowledge the problems affecting specific, long-silenced groups, then there is little progress that can be expected to be made. That is what’s causing division on college campuses like UC Berkeley and in cities like Charlottesville: not both sides that refuse to listen to each other, but the right that will not listen to the left. There is no way about it. 
Just as transgender students trying to safely use school bathrooms cannot shed their identity, just as DACA students trying to succeed at their studies while unsure what the future holds cannot shed their identity, just as female students struggling to access resources for their reproductive health cannot shed their identity — so students of these marginalized demographics cannot shed the political decisions tied to them. A member of a marginalized group cannot avoid thinking about the political climate without contextualizing about what’s at stake for him or herself. It’s understandable that a wide swath of the country has the luxury of being able to separate themselves from national administrative decisions, but it’s also imperative to understand that there are those who do not. 
Though free speech is paramount to American democracy, it is ultimately not what is at stake in today’s political turmoil. When someone who has lived an oppressed existence asks someone who has not to listen, that is not the same thing as silencing. Undoing a long-held narrow-mindedness takes thinking, and it takes understanding, and that’s reasonable. But what’s most useless is talking over marginalized groups, and then bemoaning the growing rift befalling the country. When determining how to heal national division, empathy is a good place to start.
More “Trump 2020” campaign fodder.
You know not what you do.
Adapt, or become extinct.
Lilla is the canary in the coal mine.  Listen to him or suffer the consequences.
Hillary could (and should) have won the electoral college by wide margins but unfortunately she chose to cater too much to identity politics.
I’m of Mexican descent and I ignore the ludicrous demands of illegal immigrants and MEHhA trolls all the time. They’re an embarrassment and a scourge. This is America – blend in or drop out.

Undergraduate Student Government President Austin Dunn appointed a new chief justice to the Judicial Council at the USG Senate meeting on Tuesday.
Charlynn Yeung, a senior majoring in philosophy, politics and law and business administration, was a justice on the court this past year. The Senate will have to approve Yeung’s appointment at the next USG Senate meeting.
The new appointment for chief justice was necessary as the previous chief justice, Kshitij Kumar, graduated last year. Chief justices are required to have served at least one year on the court and must be a USC student, according to Dunn.
A new justice will also need to be appointed in order to fill the vacancy left behind by Yeung as she takes on the new position. A group of USG officials will select the justice in order to ensure balance and fairness, according to Dunn. 
Dunn emphasized the detachment of the selectors from the candidates for the new justice, and described the selection process as removed and unbiased.
In addition to the Chief Justice appointment, the Senate also discussed a bill which would change the phone numbers listed on the back of all students’ USCards. Currently, all USCards list USG’s phone number and an emergency information line, but a resolution to institute a change in the USCard numbers passed last year, according to Dunn.
The resolution includes five phone numbers that may be added to the USCards, and USG will vote to select two of these numbers. They include the DPS emergency line, the USC Engemann Student Health Center’s phone number, a direct line to the Relationship and Sexual Violence Prevention and Services office and a potential 4-1-1 number to connect students to any of the aforementioned services, depending on their needs.
Dunn said that the 4-1-1 number — which has yet to be created — is his favorite option, as he said it would be the most accessible and efficient. It would serve as a 24-hour line, similar to a 9-1-1 hotline.
The Senate will vote next Tuesday on which changes to make to the USCards. 
“The USC 411 [number] would be a new avenue for students to have access to all of the resources the school has,” Dunn said. “I think it would be great to have this avenue at USC.”

Last year, former assemblymembers Mike Gatto and David Hadley were working in their respective offices, crafting policy for the state of California. This year, Gatto and Hadley have swapped their offices at the California State Assembly for new ones at USC. 
Gatto, a Democrat, and Hadley, a Republican, are the two former elected officials who now comprise the bipartisan USC Unruh Institute of Politics’ Legislators in Residence program. In its fifth year, the program aims to bridge the gap between former and future policymakers through open conversation with all students.
“The thought process was to have practitioners in policy come teach students what they know and to give a first-hand perspective to our students,” said Meghan Ginley, the community engagement director at the Unruh Institute of Politics. “You have all of these awesome professors here that teach theories and public policy, but wouldn’t it be cool to have people who have actually done that?”
In addition to holding open office hours for all students — regardless of major — and participating in Unruh panels, Gatto and Hadley will each teach a class in the political science department. Gatto is currently teaching a class titled POSC 323: Practical Politics — How Campaigns are Won or Lost.
“Hopefully I can relay a lot of valuable information to students,” Gatto said. “I had a reputation, I hope, as somebody who was willing to unite the two sides and accomplish something for the good of the state. I hope I can get students to think along those lines because both sides have a lot to offer and both sides probably believe that they are part of the solution.” 
Hadley also looks forward to teaching a class on politics and public policy in California this spring.
“I’ve guest lectured before and done public speaking in my political work,” Hadley said. “But the chance to engage directly with the same students for a full semester and to have discussions in more than sound bytes is great.”
According to Gatto, more students are becoming interested in being politically educated and active.
“Political awareness has reached a level this year that I haven’t seen in a long time,” Gatto said. “More people naturally want to get involved.”
Gatto and Hadley are entering their positions at USC at a time that many have referred to as a period of “political unrest.” Ginley believes that political life at USC took a turn starting with election night in 2016.
“There was a huge level of uncertainty when the election happened,” Ginley said. “Regardless of where you are on the political spectrum, a majority of the students expected an outcome that just didn’t happen. People didn’t really know what to say or do and students start looking at us and say, ‘Well, what now?’ We, at that point, made this decision to have open dialogue conversations and host events that cater to collaboration.” 
According to Hadley, collaboration is the essence of the Legislators in Residence program, as he and Gatto represent cohesion between the two major political parties. 
“Many people, not just students, are very cynical about politics and think about it as some kind of partisan war or partisan game,” Hadley said. “It’s great that USC pairs up two legislators from the two major parties because there are a lot of political issues that cut across party lines, and we have common issues and common opportunities we are trying to confront.”
Although the Legislators in Residence program consists of just two officials at the moment, Ginley said the Unruh Institute is looking forward to possibly expanding the program in the future.
“There is absolutely something in the works,” Ginley said. “That’s going to be something very, very exciting that our team is working on.”

The Cannes Film Festival, a talent show for the Hollywood film elite, usually conjures up images of A-list actresses in custom-made gowns and Academy Award-winning directors. While this year’s lineup included films by established directors such as Sofia Coppola and Todd Haynes, it also showcased the work of USC student Aman Adlakha. 
Adlakha, a junior majoring in film and television production, recently transferred to the USC School of Cinematic Arts from UCLA this fall semester to cultivate his budding passion for motion pictures.
While in Westwood, Adlakha wrote and directed a short film called “The Spaceman,” depicting a man who abandons his day job to pursue his lifelong dream of becoming an astronaut. Produced with a budget of less than $100, the film received widespread acclaim from viewers and critics alike, eventually being selected to screen at the Cannes Film Festival in France.
Adlakha has always considered himself artistically inclined. Growing up in New Delhi, India, he was usually seen with a camera in his hand from a young age, taking photos of remarkable landscapes and recording memorable moments while on family vacations.
In addition to his interest in film, Adlakha also developed a love for writing during his childhood. Pursuing these separately, it occurred to him that he could merge his two pastimes through writing and directing his own screenplays. However, he still was reluctant to commit to a career in film, entering UCLA without a declared major and waiting to ensure that his interests were true passions instead of mere hobbies.
It was only through his involvement with Delta Kappa Alpha, a co-ed cinema fraternity, and the Campus MovieFest — the contest through which “The Spaceman” was selected to screen at Cannes — during the past two years that drove Adlakha to major in film.
Adlakha has specialized primarily in short films, citing the limited funds and resources available for students to work on feature films. He hopes to create features later on, tapping into the inspiration behind his shorts to provide direction for his larger-scale projects down the line.
“My goal is to create the best short films that I can right now and use those as a foundation from where I can do feature films in the future,” Adlakha said.
Growing up in New Delhi with what he referred to as a Westernized upbringing, Adlakha also notes the impact other cultures have had on his work, as well as cinema’s unique ability to communicate across cultures and languages.
“I feel that it’s impossible to watch something and not be influenced by it, whether it’s Hollywood, Bollywood or Japanese films,” Adlakha said. “I’ve seen a lot of different kinds of films from different countries and filmmakers, but they all touch upon things that are very universal, which is what makes films very exciting for me because they do transcend language and other boundaries.”
This desire to allow viewers from disparate backgrounds to see elements of their own experiences in his work was one of the motivating factors in his creation of “The Spaceman.”
“It’s about this man who grows up to realize that he hasn’t really followed through with what he wanted to do,” Adlakha said. “I think that that’s something we can all relate to, because everyone has dreams and aspirations.”
The short film drew the praise of the judges in the CMF competition, and was later selected, along with 30 other films submitted by students across the nation, to be shown at Cannes. The festival attracts some of the most talented filmmakers from around the world, and proved to be a pivotal experience for Adlakha.
“Cannes was magical. It was a beach paradise in the south of France, and every day you feel so fortunate to be a part of it,” Adlakha said. “On top of that, you have some of the best movies in the world being screened and some of the biggest celebrities there.”
While at the event, Adlakha wanted to learn, since he is just beginning his career in film.
“I haven’t worked in film for 30 or 40 years, so the way I saw it was that I can learn from these people and see how [making films] actually works,” Adlakha said.  “I’m very happy that that was the perspective I went into [Cannes] with.”
Attending Cannes helped to reinforce Adlakha desire to become a filmmaker after graduation, prompting him to transfer to the School of Cinematic Arts to take advantage of the school’s modern facilities and noteworthy faculty.
Ultimately, Adlakha encourages all students to chase after their dreams, regardless of the school they attend or their specific circumstances.
“At the end of the day, if you feel that, in your heart, you know you’re supposed to be doing something, it doesn’t really matter what school you go to or which program you’re in,” Adlakha said. “If you have that vision, I always feel that no matter what it is you’re doing, whether you’re a filmmaker, an artist or a doctor, I feel that I have an obligation to follow that passion, and hopefully others pursue theirs as well.”
