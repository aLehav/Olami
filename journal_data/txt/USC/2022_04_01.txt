Samplings of baklava, joyful music and belly dance performers invited passersby to gather at Tommy Trojan for Thursday’s celebration of Arab American History Month. President Carol L. Folt spoke about the recognition of the Middle Eastern and North African Student Assembly, marking the first time students from these backgrounds were represented on an institutional level. 
Representatives from MENASA first announced their desire for recognition as a student assembly within the Undergraduate Student Government in a Feb. 15 senate meeting. Senator Brian Stowe collaborated with other senators and MENASA representatives to accomplish full recognition for the assembly. 
The official acknowledgement of the organization and the Arab presence on campus is an important step to Middle Eastern and North African students feeling seen, said Paul Rodriguez-Anter, president of the USC Lebanese Club and a senior majoring in international relations.
“Oftentimes, there’s not a place to mark that you’re Arab American, you have to mark that you’re white. When in reality, a lot of us are proud to be from our culture and don’t identify as white people,” Rodriguez-Anter said.  
Organizers and attendees said that the diverse representation of Arabic students was an important part of the cultural celebration. The event showcased performers from many groups including the USC Lebanese Club, the Persian Student Organization and the Armenian Students’ Association.
“Our events are definitely for our Middle Eastern and North African students, but the line does not stop there,” said Nour Myra Geha, event coordinator at MENASA and a freshman majoring in international relations. “[By] sharing our experiences, sharing our heritage, sharing our culture, we’re sharing it with all of the students and we welcome everyone on campus to come and experience all of these things with us.”
Folt and professors gave speeches to attendees recognizing Middle Eastern and North African members of the community. 
“Having the president of our University speaking at this event for representation for Middle Eastern and North African communities is a huge deal because I’ve seen her address other cultural groups … but I feel like I haven’t ever heard her like talk about specifically Middle Eastern and African representation,” said Marwa Alami, a freshman majoring in business administration.
Abdullah Muayad, a junior majoring in biology and the outreach leader of MENASA, invites members of the Middle Eastern and North African community to visit the MENASA lounge, located in Student Union 100, where he said a mix of different cultures underscores the beauty of the community. The MENASA culturally-affirming lounge opened in Fall 2021 within the Center for Black Cultural and Student Affairs to provide a physical space for identity expression. 
“I just hope people get a sense of home,” said Stella Seppassipour, a junior majoring in political science. “A lot of people here are international students. So sometimes it’s difficult to adapt to American society and the mentality in the United States. So it’s like a bit of a relaxing place [where we] understand each other and it’s like home.” 
Alami said MENASA “revamped” their organization this year and the additional University representation is a “huge deal” to her. 
“Having baklava, a cultural desert, being handed out, and having our music being played like belly dancing in the beginning kind of validates it for me,” Alami said. “It’s really nice to see that you’re being seen on campus and you’re accepted here on campus and there’s other people from your community.”
Rodriguez-Anter said the individual Arabic and Middle Eastern clubs plan to collaborate to host additional events this month, including a beach bonfire and potluck. 
“The hard truth is that the Middle Eastern and North African culture is represented in such a bad way [in the] media and in such a bad way [in the] news,” Geha said. “It’s shown as such an ugly part of the world but we’re here to tell them that no, we have so much love and peace in us. We have so much culture to share with you. We have so much to give to this campus.”

The USC Survivor Support Community — launched this semester by Sammie Sorsby-Jones and Yi-Ann Li — aims to create a safe space for survivors to find community, emotional support and advocacy. 
Sorsby-Jones, a sophomore majoring in law, history, and culture,  and Li, a sophomore majoring in English and psychology, first met when they were 16 at a summer program in Rhode Island. In the span of three weeks, they bonded and were thrilled when they found out they both would attend USC in the fall of 2020. Connecting over a shared biology class, the pair became even closer throughout their first year on campus.
“We’d study for all our biology tests, and then we very much became closer over being survivors together,” Sorsby-Jones said. “I had the idea for a while, and then I was like, ‘Please join it with me.’ And yeah, it would not exist without [Li].”
Sorsby-Jones and Li, who serve as the club’s president and vice president, respectively, said they understand the unique challenges people face after experiencing sexual violence.
“You walk out of that office after the report, and there are no systems in place to help you stand back up when you freefall … You feel incredibly lonely and isolated,” Li said. “Because they have everything they need from me, till maybe they come back asking for more. So now I’m left on my own.”
The USC Survivor Support Community’s weekly meetings intend to cultivate an environment of openness and guidance to alleviate feelings of isolation, according to the club’s founders. Rather than demand administrative accountability, Sorsby-Jones and Li said they hope to spark change through healing and empowerment.
“[We need] much more open conversations, but in a way, that actually leads to community change — not in a way that’s just ‘Let’s throw money at a national organization without actually seeing how we contribute to this,’” Sorsby-Jones said. “What we have more control over is bottom-up [reform] and actually making really tangible change in our own communities.”
Last fall, USC faced nationwide criticism following multiple incidents of drugging and assault at the Sigma Nu fraternity that were reported to the Department of Public Safety between Sept. 25 and Sept. 30. After weeks of student-led protests, the University suspended the fraternity and later announced the suspension of four additional fraternities in a Jan. 18 communitywide email.
“I was one of the victim survivors from that incident … I was told that there were so many other people who were in the same shoes as me,” Li said. “I felt like there wasn’t quite a space on campus for survivors.”
Sorsby-Jones and Li cited the University’s lack of transparency and accountability following the 2021 reports as motivation to strive for change.
“There is so much confusion,” Li said. “There’s no transparency, no cohesive statement of support, and it just feels like there’s a lot more the administration and people in higher levels of the bureaucracy could be doing to try to better protect the students on campus.”
Weeks after the suspensions, the Interfraternity Council conducted an investigation after “multiple reports of potential violations of the moratorium on social events,” according to an email sent to the Daily Trojan from the organization Oct. 24. 
“It’s really fascinating to me to see how sexual assault on campus is this open secret,” Sorsby-Jones said. “The only difference, the only standout thing, about last semester, in terms of having a reckoning, was that people reported and there was a Universitywide email sent out … It’s not because there was more sexual assault, there was the same amount of there’s always been.”
The club’s Instagram has garnered more than 200 followers since its launch in January and aims to advocate and provide information regarding campus resources for survivors.
“We really wanted to bring advocacy into a personal light, because it’s a lot harder to … disagree with something when you know someone who it’s happened to,” said Kate McQuarrie, the director of advocacy at SSC and a sophomore majoring in English literature.
Li also hopes to discuss the unique struggle of being a survivor from a marginalized community through her role in SSC.
“There’s so much cultural stigma tied to different minority communities about [sex], that when I went through what I went through, I felt like there was nobody I could talk to — I wasn’t even sure if I could talk to my own parents about it,” Li said. “Part of my participation on the e-board in this club is trying to create a space for survivors in marginalized communities to understand that it’s okay to talk about it.”
SSC participated in the University Visions and Voices event, “Hues of Healing: Restorative Art Therapy for Survivors of Sexual Assault and Their Allies” Friday. Through meditation, art therapy and discussion, event planners intended to “foster a community where survivors feel safe, heard, and supported.”
“This event really helped people think of different ways on how to heal from their experiences, and meet new people that can help them as well,” said Ivy Riley, director of diversity, equity and inclusion for SSC and a freshman majoring in sociology.
The club plans to continue building its community through campus events and weekly meetings, which are open to survivors and allies.
“I really hope that my club will create an open dialogue around it because, far too often, these things are surrounded in silence,” Sorsby-Jones said. “I think of myself, even more than being a survivor, as just being a support to survivors.”

No. 21 USC women’s tennis will return to action at home this weekend for conference matches against Washington State Friday and No. 24 Washington Saturday. 
USC’s recent losses came on the road against Pac-12 rivals Stanford and UC Berkeley, who both remain undefeated in conference play. These were the Trojans’ final matches in March, a month that saw them go 4-4 overall. 
Sophomore Naomi Cheong has been a welcomed sight for USC since returning from injury. She entered the ITA rankings for singles last week at No. 78 and currently holds a 6-2 record in singles matches. 
“I want to do my very best to help out the team in any kind of way, whether that’s on-court or off-court,” Cheong said in an interview with the Daily Trojan. “Being able to compete with other schools and competing with my team, just being able to have the opportunity to play, I’m not really taking it for granted.”
The Trojans began March with a loss to No. 37 Utah, which was their sixth consecutive loss at the time. The team then turned things around after that match as they went on a four-match winning streak. 
As April begins, the Trojans ride a three-match losing streak, with Pac-12 championships right around the corner. 
In their last three losses, USC has consistently given up the doubles point. Because of this, Cheong said that the team emphasized doubles play in practice this week in order to feel less stress when going into singles.
The Trojans will be looking to further spoil a tough stretch for the Cougars Friday, as they have secured two victories since the start of February. On the season, Washington State is 6-10 and has gone 1-6 in road matches. 
Despite this, Cheong said the team is not taking their conference opposition lightly, and they can only assume that the Cougars will play their best.
“Anyone can beat anyone, especially in the Pac 12 conference,” she said. “It’s just who can show up on the court and play better that day.”
USC will then host the Huskies Saturday. Washington sports a 13-5 record on the season, 4-1 against the Pac-12 — its only loss in Pac-12 play coming against Oregon in its most recent match. Before losing to the Ducks, the Huskies rode a six-match win streak, with four of those wins coming against other Pac-12 teams. 
Although Washington has a winning record and ranks No. 24 in the nation, the team does not have any players ranked nationally for either singles or doubles. 
The Huskies, however, have senior Vanessa Wong, who was a part of the 2021 All-Pac-12 First Team and named the ITA Northwest Region Senior Player of the Year last year. Wong also has 109 career singles wins and sits two singles wins away from setting a record at Washington. 
Although the Trojans took a couple of defeats against Pac-12 rivals last weekend, team morale is still high heading this weekend. 
“We have the full trust in each other that everyone will do their best and compete,” Cheong said. “We just know that we have to keep doing what we’re doing to do our best and the results will come.”
The Trojans played five of their eight total matches in March on the road. However, moving forward, USC will be playing at home for seven of its next eight matches. With a 3-3 conference record, two wins this weekend can be pivotal for the team, as they are currently tied with Oregon for fifth place in the Pac-12. 
USC is set to play against Washington State Friday at 1:30 p.m. and Washington Saturday at 1 p.m. in back-to-back home matchups.

USC faces a major test this weekend as it faces No. 1 Stanford for the second time this season. The No. 3 Trojans fell to the Cardinal earlier this season, losing 16-10 in the Barbara Kalbus semifinals. USC will look to disrupt Stanford and give the Cardinal their first loss in 10 games, as well as reclaim the top spot in the rankings.
It has been about two weeks since the Trojans were last in action, as they had a week off after heading to Hawaii for a week-long training session.
In Hawaii, the Trojans took down the Rainbow Warriors 12-9 March 18. This improved their record to 13-2 on the season and gave them their third straight win.
Redshirt sophomore 2-meter Tilly Kearns notched 4 goals in the win against Hawaii. Kearns is having a dominant season for the Trojans, leading them in scoring with 43 goals in her first season back since taking Olympic leave. 
Kearns earned her second Mountain Pacific Sports Federation Player of the Week Award for her performance against the Rainbow Warriors. 
She views the extra time off since the last game as a good thing, as a way to better prepare for this week’s tough opponents.
“We were able to step back and have that extra week that we could afford to just focus on [Stanford] and not worry about other teams,” said Kearns in an interview with the Daily Trojan. “We’ve dedicated almost two weeks to solely studying them and their tendencies and how they play, so we know exactly what we’re going to face and exactly what we’re going to do to beat them.”
The entire team is ready to redeem themselves after the last game against Stanford. The 16-10 loss marked only the third time in the last five seasons the Trojans have lost by 6 or more goals; Stanford again in 2018 and UCLA last season. 
It was an irregularity and the team and Head Coach Marko Pintaric would like to keep it that way.
“We entered the season as number one. That’s in their heads, and then we are now going to show you how to go and beat Stanford at Stanford. There’s no other thoughts, there’s no other doubts,” Pintaric said. “That’s the beauty of playing for USC, you always go for the win … I know the team is confident going into the game, and despite the result I know they will keep fighting like they always do.”
USC will take on No. 13 San Jose State Sunday after Stanford Saturday 
The Trojans are also quite familiar with the Spartans, having faced them back in February and winning by a score of 20-3. The games this weekend against the Spartans and the Cardinal will mark USC’s second and third straight away games. 
By the time the Trojans play their next home game, the last game of the season, it will have been more than a month since their last home game. Senior utility Claire Haas thinks not playing in front of their home fans could play to their advantage this weekend.
“When you don’t have fans and they’re cheering for the other team, it’s also a little bit more of a push. It brings out that competitiveness because you’re like ‘you know what we’re the underdogs in this situation,’” Haas said. 
The Cardinal have had the Trojans’ number the last five seasons, as Stanford has beaten the Trojans more times than any other opponent has. 
Kearns and the rest of the team hope to flip that script come Saturday.
“Against Stanford, there’s redemption to be done. Last time I was here back in 2019 we lost to them back in the [NCAA] final, and of course we lost to them earlier in this season,” Kearns said. “I’ve got a fire in my belly, I want to prove myself and I want to win, finally, against them.”
USC heads to Avery Aquatic Center Saturday to play Stanford at 1 p.m., and on Sunday it goes to SRAC pool to match up against San Jose State at 12 p.m.

As March turns into April and the due dates for final exams and papers inch closer, there’s no better way to avoid the stress of the second semester than by watching some baseball. 
While the Trojans are well above .500 in their overall record, their conference play has left something to be desired, going 4-5 thus far. Fortunately, there are plenty of high-stakes series remaining for the USC baseball team. Here’s a breakdown of the five key remaining series for USC as it seeks to climb out of the bottom half of the Pac-12 rankings.  
At Home vs. No. 3 Oregon State
Potentially the Trojans’ biggest matchup, No. 3 Oregon State comes to Los Angeles with a 19-5 overall record, 6-3 in conference play. 
The Beavers have a strong batting lineup, with a team average of .336 and over 10 runs scored in 10 of their 24 games. Junior outfielder Jacob Melton has had a monster season, with an on-base-percentage of .405, slugging percentage of .760 and 9 home runs in 24 games. 
USC’s bullpen will need to be on their A-game when facing the Beavers. 
At Home vs. No. 15 Arizona
Another telling series for the Trojans will be against No. 15 Arizona in May. Fortunately for USC, this series will also take place in the comfort of Dedeaux Field in L.A.
The Wildcats started the season with three consecutive wins against Kansas State, Oklahoma and then-No. 14 Texas Tech. Recently, Arizona swept Stanford, winning its three games by a combined score of 19-10. With strong starting pitchers such as sophomore TJ Nichols and senior Garrett Irvin, the Wildcats can control the game from the pitching mound. 
Away vs. Arizona State
The Trojans will travel to Tempe to face Arizona State in mid-April. With an 11-15 record, the Sun Devils haven’t had the best of seasons. However, they currently have a leg up on USC with a 3-3 record in Pac-12 play. 
The top eight teams in the
Pac-12 earn a spot in the conference tournament, so defeating teams that are similarly on the bubble will be crucial for USC. With a team ERA of 5.94, the Trojans could take advantage of a team that has struggled to keep opponents off of the scoreboard. 
At home vs. Washington
USC will have another chance to climb the Pac-12 standings against Washington in mid-May. The Huskies are fourth in the Pac-12 with a 5-4 conference record. 
Offensively, Washington is led by redshirt sophomore infielder Will Simpson, who has 7 home runs in 24 games, and redshirt sophomore catcher Johnny Tincher, who sports a .414 on base percentage and a .341 batting average. 
The Huskies have an impressive team ERA of 3.58 and have allowed double digits just once all season. Late in the season, a few wins against Washington would be big for the Trojans. 
Away vs. Stanford
A team that just fell out of the D1Baseball.com top 25, Stanford struggled in its series against Arizona and Oregon. Early in the season, the Cardinal had an impressive win against No. 2 Arkansas, in which junior starting pitcher Quinn Mathews allowed just 2 hits in the six innings he pitched. 
Stanford sits tied with USC in the Pac-12 standings, also sporting a 4-5 conference record. The Trojans will travel to Palo Alto to face the Cardinal in their last series of the season, and depending on how the season plays out, it could mean the difference between making the conference tournament and missing out on the postseason.

“Aramark, listen. We are in the fight,” custodial staff and supporters chanted in Spanish outside Union Hall Thursday afternoon. Messages clipped to their chest, some read “Aramark Unlivable Wages,” others said, “Janitors are worth more than 3%.” Passing cars honked in support and megaphones blared, chanting “Justice for Janitors!”
The struggle for fair wages for the USC custodial staff continued today as the janitors gathered in front of Union Hall on Washington Boulevard to support the negotiations between the custodial staff and Aramark. Thursday was the last day of the contract extension.
Rosa Franco, a janitor participating in the protests, said she hopes the negotiations will lead to a contract with more benefits, or at least higher salaries. For Franco and many others, more benefits mean the ability to survive. 
“It’s not fair, you can’t survive with 30 to 35 thousand a year to pay mortgage bills, gas right now is so expensive,” Franco said. “We can’t survive with five cents.”
Juan Carlos Venejes, the lead organizer of the janitorial division and organizer of the contract, said the workers came to Union Hall to “put some pressure” on their employers and “let their voices be heard.” The most important issue for the workers is a living wage. 
“We want to work towards having wages for people to be able to cover basic costs: be able to put a roof over their heads, provide for their families,” Venejes said. “At the current wages, we don’t believe that. It’s not possible for people to work at these wages and live a dignified life.” 
One student attendee, Vianca Ruiz, a freshman majoring in business, decided to show her support after seeing the custodial staff marching over a week ago. Once she heard that the protestors were mainly Latinx, as a Latina herself, she was bothered and wanted to find out more. A representative at the march said that the movement needed more student support. After hearing that, she said she felt it was important for her to come to the protest. Ruiz said students “have a duty” to help if they can. 
“If they’re put at an institution like USC, then you’re more than able to help and at least say something,” Ruiz said. “I’m not putting in any financial or anything other than just my time and my presence and I feel like that can be met by each and every student Hispanic or not.”
David Mendoza, a member of the custodial service, said he appreciates the help that USC students have given them, especially during the protest Wednesday. Thursday, however, was about fighting for a “good contract.” 
“Especially for the insurance for the medication,” Mendoza said. “We fight for better benefits for insurance.”
In a statement to the Daily Trojan, Chris Collom, associate vice president of corporate communications at Aramark, wrote that they “will continue to meet with the union in an effort to reach a new contract.”
“We respect the right of our employees to demonstrate and look forward to continuing to bargain in good faith to reach an agreement that works for everyone,” Collom wrote.
Michael Sullivan, a sophomore majoring in screenwriting who also attended the event, thinks students should support the workers by signing the petition, help hold the university accountable and make sure the custodial staff’s work does not go unnoticed.
“These good people are trying to do that job and they do a great job, the campus always looks shiny and clean,” Sullivan said. “The fact they aren’t getting the wages they deserve for all the hard work they do is really messed up.”
After chanting outside Union Hall, the supporters moved inside while waiting for the initial contract from Aramark. According to Venejes, he expects that Aramark will come to the table with an offer “meets our expectation of what we feel is a living wage.” 
Venejes said that students can help support the workers by spreading the word about their importance on campus. 
“When you go into your classrooms or different areas of the campus, you guys appreciate that they’re clean,” Venejes said. “That’s what they do, every morning or in the middle of the night, they’re fixing the tables, fixing the chairs, cleaning the blackboards and the whiteboards, whatever the case may be.”

I originally planned on writing this column about how I frequently go down rabbitholes when watching YouTube videos and how you can find yourself that way in novels as well. You know, how a viewing of the deleted scene of “Green Green Dress”  from “tick, tick … BOOM!” (2021) quickly turned into funny videos of “high school musical 3 being the best one” to “camp rock on crack” to “aquamarine is bae.” But maybe that would have been too much of an exposure of my chaotic YouTube watch history and really, the structure of the column changed a lot on Sunday night. So, as Joan Rivers said: “Can we talk?” 
My terrible secret? I’m an Oscars watcher. Like, I make it a night. It means takeout and the awards show and the Los Angeles Times list of nominees. Maybe it’s just an L.A. thing in spite of the declining ratings. Am I right often? No. But, I did anticipate Ariana DeBose and the best picture winner (10/10 would recommend) and totally did not expect that slap. Has there ever been such a moment since 2017’s envelope-gate? Has Twitter been so active in ages? Has anyone seen Faye Dunaway? I need answers. (Sorry. Ever since this happened, my brain has been like the guys in the OK GO treadmill video just jumping around.) 
I grew up on musicals and will say  this with confidence: Oscars season made my heart sing with the number of movie musicals (“Dear Evan Hansen” adaptation? We don’t know her!). You may be wondering what musicals have to do with books and why I rambled about the Oscars. Well, it goes beyond the traditional three-act structure. 
When I call a book cinematic, it’s a compliment. It’s a compliment that I use in my creative writing workshops on campus. It means that the story sucked me in, and  I could see the character and look at the world that the author created through their eyes. It’s something that I look for in a story, because when I crack open a spine, like many, I want to forget about the surrounding world for a second. A book is noise-canceling headphones for the soul. 
Speaking of that cinematic quality, have I told you all about how much I love Joan Didion? Maybe I have, I don’t know, time is still fake to me. But, anyway, like most other self-respecting California girls (No, not Katy Perry), I adore Joan Didion. Previously, I’d read most of her more popular stuff, but recently, I picked up her book, “Where I Was From.” The cinematic part of it? Walking around campus listening to the audiobook with the California sun on my shoulders, feeling like the main character through and through. Obviously, the ideal listening experience. 
“Where I Was From” melds memoir, history and journalism into 226 pages as Didion reckons with the California dream and how the state is full of contradictions. She talks about the parts of California beyond the two big cities that are said to represent the state and instead looks at the farmland, the city of Lakewood in Southern California and the Sierra Nevadas. She uses her journalism skills to dive into a scandal at Lakewood High School, and she gets a bit maudlin as she opens up the book writing about her great-great-great-great-great grandmother (if you’re wondering about how she was able to get that far back in her family tree, don’t worry, because I was too).  
 A Goodreads review on the piece mentioned that Didion could write about plastic bags and the reviewer would still read it. So, if you are the exact opposite of me and could not fathom picking up a book about history, read it instead for Didion’s writing. 
Speaking of writing and family and going back to the great-great grandparents and all of the things that I love most, let’s talk about Anita Diamant. Diamant is the sort of author that you probably know best from your mom’s book club from about 10 years ago full of yentas. She’s fantastic and I want her to get beyond that niche demographic. In 2015, as a sophomore in high school, I reviewed her book, “The Boston Girl,” on my Goodreads, having written, “I LOVE THIS BOOK SO MUCH. It feels like a big hug.” Diamant takes us on a cinematic (there’s that word again) journey of a Rabbinical student interviewing her grandmother about her life growing up in Boston’s North End at the turn of the twentieth century. The central question: “How did you get to be the woman that you are today?” It’s about family, sisterhood and history. One of my favorite sorts of stories is the kind that goes through the narrator’s life, and “The Boston Girl” delivers on that front with Addie — our protagonist — weaving seamlessly through the experiences that made her. Genuinely, I return to this book every two years or so. I still love it, in all-caps. 
Speaking of books that I love and devoured, let’s talk about Celeste Ng’s “Little Fires Everywhere” that made her a book club darling. Of course, it should come as no surprise to you that this book also deals with some history. (Not a lot! Don’t get scared!) “Little Fires Everywhere” wants you to think. It wants you to think about the custody battle, firebugs, the planned community of Shaker Heights and mother-daughter relationships. It’s stellar, and it’s not necessarily a hidden gem any longer thanks to the Hulu series. But, it’s worth picking up if you haven’t yet. 
Aside from my strongly-held belief that we should talk more about Mike Faist in “West Side Story,” I also believe that a book should hold a cinematic quality. It should feel like a can’t tear your eyes away film, a star-studded musical number, a lonely cowboy walking in the desert as the saloon door swings or the action sequence that makes you white-knuckle grip your popcorn. I’m a generally impatient person with my media, which is why I tend to go back to my old favorites in television, so trust me when I say that you want cinematic in your books.

This review contains spoilers.
It has been said that humans are born with only two basic fears: falling and loud noises. But, as Warner Bros.’ newest celestial rom-com “Moonshot,” released March 31, suggests, there may be a third fear to consider: loneliness. 
Stories help everyone feel a little less alone in the universe. “Moonshot,” directed by Christopher Winterbauer, tells the story of two college-age students who are willing to traverse the cosmos for human connection. 
The year is 2049, and Walt (Cole Sprouse) has made it his sole mission to be accepted to Kovi Industries’ Student Mars Program. With 36 rejections to his name and an impending graduation date, Walt realizes that this may be his final opportunity to find where he fits in the universe. Meanwhile, Sophie (Lana Condor) is busy missing her long-term boyfriend Calvin (Mason Gooding) after he takes a job out of town — way out of town. As a published scientist, Calvin is posted on Mars for eight months, and Sophie feels as though the only person who understands her is 55 million miles away. 
When Walt crosses paths with the alluring Ginny (Emily Rudd) at a college party, he becomes convinced that he’s found the one. The two spend a “Before Sunrise”-esque night together, which concludes with Walt learning that Ginny will be moving the following day — to Mars. Desperate to maintain a connection with her, Walt sets off in search of a way to fly to the fiery planet. When he learns that Sophie can afford a ticket — not to mention the fact that her boyfriend is stationed on Mars — Walt convinces her to pay up and proceeds to sneak onboard the ship. Thus begins this elaborate out-of-this-world escapade. 
The primary reason why the film is such a pleasure to watch is because of Condor and Sprouse’s performances. While the chemistry isn’t always there, the charm is never lacking. When asked about his approach to playing Walt in a roundtable event for college students hosted on March 24, Sprouse took the “Moonshot” approach by fusing sardonicism and sincerity. 
“I think, for me, I wanted Walt to feel super approachable, and I’ve been going so ‘My Chemical Romance’ with my emo dark hair on Riverdale for the last 16 years that I … I wanted him to feel like your kind of old best friend, the really annoying guy that used to hang around, like, the edge of the group, so I just shadowed my brother [Dylan Sprouse] for a while,” Sprouse said. 
Condor also admitted that she modeled Sophie’s character after someone she knew well: her mom. As a bonafide type-A personality who loves a plan, Condor studied her mother’s idiosyncrasies to help her get into character. Sophie’s obsessive nature provides a nice and satisfying balance to Walt’s impulsive and spur-of-the-moment antics, resulting in a film that feels like a hilarious buddy-cop comedy with a romantic twist. 
Similar to an incredibly tailored spacesuit, Sprouse and Condor actually appear to fit the ages of their college-aged characters. The decision to set the film in college allows Walt and Sophie to exercise a greater degree of independence than they realistically would in high school. In spite of this, both characters prove that they have a great deal left to learn.
Oftentimes,  the film’s central duo feels as though they are shooting for a sky of unattainable stars. As if what they desire most in this world — to belong to something bigger than themselves — is just out of reach. It is in this way that the film captures the typical college experience, the primary difference being the planetary backdrop. 
There is a particularly poignant moment close to the beginning of the film when Ginny quotes Mars enthusiast and astronomer Sarah Stewart Johnson’s 2020 novel “The Sirens of Mars: Searching for Life on Another World” to Walt. 
“We have seen in Mars a utopia. A wilderness. A sanctuary. An oracle … without data that could be used to cabin our inquiry or limit our imagination, Mars has been a blank canvas. And tenderly, our human seeking has rushed to fill it,” Ginny said. 
If life is the careful art of joyful interrogation, then “Moonshot” is brimming with joie de vivre. The film’s characters are, rather reasonably, questioning themselves, their places in the universe, and their purposes on this planet (and those that lie beyond). It is a testament to the singular nature of the human experience — to the vast, glowing, empty page that we call life. 
As the film blatantly suggests, we are the light for each other amidst the loneliness. By forging meaningful relationships with others, we can create energy where there once was none. 
Ultimately, “Moonshot” is a lighthearted love letter to the spirit of adventure, and a testament to the undeniable power of human connection. It is proof that planetary pilgrimages — however predictable or laden with tropes they may be — can make for wonderfully enjoyable entertainment, should you be willing to forgo all fear and explore what lies beyond.

With the next set of course registration just around the corner, it’s likely that all students will have the same two tabs open: USC Web Registration and Rate My Professors. Rate My Professors, as its name suggests, lists nearly two million professors and allows for reviews to be written on them. 
As noted by a 2018 Daily Trojan article, students are often swayed by the reviews left about a certain professor, regardless of certain factors such as the voluntary response bias. It is easy, especially for professors themselves, to see the drawbacks of the anonymous rating component of the site. However, the website can serve as a resource through which students understand aspects of the professor’s teaching style and class expectations prior to registering for the course. 
Professors receive University mandated course evaluations at the tail end of each semester, written by students in their class anonymously. However, changes don’t seem to be made based on the evaluations, as certain professors continue to receive negative feedback on the Rate My Professors website semester after semester. What does this say about how professors view students’ opinions in their end-of-semester course evaluations?
While it is true that certain students may have a unique experience with a certain professor that does not reflect the majority of their peers’ opinions, there is a transactional aspect to course evaluations that should be considered. 
For the class of 2025, USC’s acceptance rate fell to 12%, further reinforcing the difficulty students face in being admitted. Considering this and USC’s high tuition cost, it is understandable that students have high expectations of their professors. Comments that are repeated in course evaluations should be taken into consideration by professors, who have also done great work in order to earn their position at such a prestigious institution.
While anyone — even a student who has not enrolled in a certain professor’s course — can leave a random review, some students may feel more comfortable being honest on the site, knowing it is possible that their professor may not come across it. Additionally, many course evaluations are done during class time, where students may not feel completely comfortable writing a fully honest review. Furthermore, students do not have access to other students’ evaluations, so someone who is considering taking a certain course only has access to the public reviews on Rate My Professors. 
It is easy to see why many professors brush aside their reviews on Rate My Professors, as it is not a site associated with the University and has many aspects to it that make it a less credible source. Nonetheless, professors must take all of their students’ opinions into account, understanding that not every single one may be as valid as the next. This is salient considering both the private nature of course evaluations and the USC Schedule Helper Google Chrome extension. USC Schedule Helper automatically shows students a certain professor’s numerical rating from Rate My Professors as they are registering for their courses, creating a direct bridge between course registration and the website. 
As pointed out by another 2018 Daily Trojan article entitled “Here’s the problem with Rate My Professors,” the site is far from perfect. Students have the ability to write multiple reviews on one professor in an effort to skew their rating, and the site itself operates on “reduc[ing] individual instructors into mere numbers.” This is a nuanced problem, but one that requires cooperation from both students and professors. While students should be honest when reviewing a professor, they should not take advantage of the platform to cause harm. Professors, too, should try to absorb the different reviews that they receive, particularly ones that are repeated. 
Professors, similar to students, cannot be reduced to a number. Rate My Professors is a great tool to use, but it shouldn’t discourage students from trying out new classes or getting disheartened when they don’t get a professor with a rating of 4.0 or above. Nonetheless, the website was created for a reason: to allow students to give professors feedback and for other students to review them as they register for classes. A bad class schedule has quite an impact on a student’s college experience, so it’s the University’s responsibility to listen to its students and ensure their feedback is received.

I accompany my parents a lot on errands, especially if there’s a product return or complaint involved. My presence there serves a sole purpose: to translate.
Most of the time, I’m a funnel for my mom’s frustrations that takes her dicey words in Spanish and refines them to a polite English. I then take the worker’s civil explanation to my mom’s qualms and cross my fingers that she finally lets the issue go (she never does). 
This gets worse during the holiday season, with it, has come a sense of embarrassment of this back and forth that I experience. I feel the worker’s annoyed stare while I talk on the side with my mom, the line of customers getting long behind us, and I feel that this would all be easier if they understood her. 
Most of this comes out of my own anxiety, but it partially comes from a past experience running errands at the Macy’s store at Arden Fair Mall. I don’t remember what it was specifically, but for some reason, we were at the customer service center yet again. This time, the worker called us racial slurs.
For all my mom’s usual pride that she is right and has to be right, I saw that spark die out the moment she realized what she — what all of us — had been called. She gathered herself, said that it wasn’t worth it and let the issue go.
My mom likes to say she understands English, she just can’t speak it very well. And there is a fierce pride in how much she loves Spanish. She tells my cousins who don’t speak it well that they have to learn it; she corrects my grammar at the dinner table and she has a collection of Spanish almanacs that abuelita brings from Guatemala.
Her love for the language rubbed off on me, even though I acknowledge I’m speaking the tongue of conquistadors. Even though my parents never understood what I was learning about in school, they loved hearing about my Spanish classes. 
During my freshman year of college, I knew I wanted to pick up another major, but I just didn’t know what. I wanted it to enhance what I was learning about in my journalism classes, but I also wanted it to be for me.
I loved learning about Spanish in high school and all its intricacies and quirks, and I loved the whole other world of literature and political theory it opened up to me. I thought that if I wanted to learn about the history and inner workings of Latin America, I had to go straight to the source, so I picked Spanish as my second major. 
The significance of it didn’t really hit until my friend showed me a passage from Gloria Anzaldúa’s “Borderlands / La Frontera: The New Mestiza” where in the essay “How To Tame a Wild Tongue,” she writes, “So, if you want to really hurt me, talk badly about my language. Ethnic identity is twin skin to linguistic identity — I am my language. Until I can take pride in my language, I cannot take pride in myself.”
Taking pride in my language has been an ongoing struggle like I am desperate to prove that it is a worthy and legitimate thing to speak. I’ve realized I don’t speak it enough, and every time I’m in class I fear I don’t know it well, so, therefore, I don’t know myself well enough. 
I can be around my friends who speak Spanish — who know that we all speak Spanish, who speak Spanish with their families, who associate the language with part of their identity — yet our default is English. We only speak in Spanish when we want to trade secrets in groups so no one will understand what we are saying, reducing our mother tongue to something that can only be associated with shadows and not light.
There’s also the internal comparison between whose Spanish is more advanced than others’, who gets closest to the textbook and who mixes up English in their words. With this comes another discourse over which not knowing Spanish somehow makes you less Latinx.
At the end of the day, I can’t say I’m any better. I’ll never initiate a conversation in Spanish, especially around others who don’t understand the language. There’s a twinge of embarrassment that I can’t shake off, as if I’m using dirty words and dirty pronunciations, a feeling of wrongness that this is just not how people communicate in these spaces. There’s a twinge of guilt that I feel like I’m excluding others, that I’m not accommodating for everyone. 
To reserve language to designated safe spaces — to spaces where our Latinidad is sanctioned — feels wrong, especially when others who are not of Latinx background sign up to learn the language. If they can take pride in knowing it, why can’t I? Why can’t we?
