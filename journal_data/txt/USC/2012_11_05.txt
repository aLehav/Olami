The following incidents were reported in the USC Dept. of Public Safety incident report summary on Saturday, Nov. 3. 
Crimes against a person
At 1:25 a.m., a non-USC female reported that a suspect punched her in the mouth during a confrontation between her friends and several unidentified people outside Terrace Apartments. DPS officers conducted a search but were unable to locate the suspect.
At 1:19 a.m., a student reported that another student physically assaulted several people inside the Pi Kappa Phi fraternity and cut one of them with a piece of broken glass. The officers detained the suspect and recovered the piece of glass, then arrested him and transported him to 77th station for booking. A student whose finger was cut with the glass was treated by an LAFD RA unit and released.
At 12:48 a.m., a student reported that a security guard pushed her several times while she was leaving a party at the Sigma Delta Tau sorority. She was not injured and did not want criminal prosecution, but requested a report for documentation.
Miscellaneous incidents
At 12:30 p.m., an intoxicated student damaged the door latch and frame of a portable toilet on Child’s Way and Trousdale Parkway when he became trapped inside and kicked the door open.
At 12:35 a.m., DPS officers responded to a student who cut his head when he hit it on a beer keg while wrestling with his roommates. An LAFD RA unit responded to treat the student and released him to seek additional medical treatment on his own.
It’s the not beer but the keg that kills people!

Real estate entrepreneur David Dollinger donated $10 million to grow the USC Price School of Public Policy’s Master of Real Estate Development endowment, the university announced Monday.
The program will be renamed the Dollinger Master of Real Estate Development Program.
Dollinger is the first Price School alumnus to endow a degree program at the school.
The multi-million dollar contribution will be used to recruit additional adjunct faculty and provide professional development opportunities for graduate students, such as funding for attendance at national conferences and international travel, according to a statement released by the USC Price School of Public Policy.
Since 1929, the USC Price School of Public Policy has prepared students for careers in public service in disciplines ranging from real estate to transportation and infrastructure. The Master of Real Estate Development degree program has been offered since 1986.
After his graduation from the first class of the degree program, Dollinger created his family-owned business Dollinger Properties, which focuses on the acquisition and development of multi-tenant industrial and retail properties for long-term ownership. Dollinger has also had experience with developing and managing more than 60 properties and notable businesses in California, including Best Buy and PetSmart.
Dollinger made a contribution to the school because he believes the “Dollinger Master of Real Estate Development Program is the best real estate degree in the nation.”
His donation corresponds with the goals of the university’s campaign program, which aims to advance the university’s academics and global influence by raising more than $6 billion in the coming years through private donations. This is the third multi-million dollar contribution to a USC school in the past month.
Jack H. Knott, dean of the USC Price School of Public Policy, also believes this contribution will serve as inspiration for current graduate students in the Real Estate Development program.
“The naming of the Dollinger Master of Real Estate Development Program serves as a fitting tribute to David’s legacy at the USC Price School, as well as his commitment to supporting the next generation of leaders in real estate development,” Knott said in a press release.

Two-time Pulitzer Prize winner and renowned global health journalist Nicholas Kristof discussed his push for gender equality and his most recent book at a speaker series hosted by the USC Spectrum, the Program Board Speakers Committee and the USC Institute for Global Health at the Ronald Tutor Campus Center on Monday.
Columnist · Students filled the Ronald Tutor Campus Center ballroom on Monday to hear Nicholas Kristof discuss his work as an activist. – Joseph Chen | Daily Trojan
Kristof’s 2009 book Half the Sky: Turning Oppression into Opportunity for Women Worldwide was inspired by his efforts to improve the lives of women around the world, especially in parts of Africa and Asia. In the book, Kristof and co-author Sheryl WuDunn focus on women’s issues, such as sex trafficking, maternal mortality and women’s right to education — the latter of which, according to Kristof, could be integral to gender equality.
“Education really is the best way of bringing about change,” Kristof said. “One of the greatest ways to bring about change, for example, is bringing television to those people in villages with very traditional attitudes. Six months of [Western] television in a village was equivalent to four years of education. It was really profound.”
Kristof shared anecdotes about his experiences reporting abroad, including a story about Dei Manju, a young girl living in the Hubei province of China. Kristof said Manju was never supposed to go to school. Like many other Chinese girls, she was never afforded that privilege because some Chinese parents are reluctant to invest in their daughters’ educations. However, after Kristof wrote about her in his New York Times column, donations allowed for her to graduate from high school and eventually become an accountant — proving Kristof’s theory that education could truly be essential to gender equality.
“These girls that would have otherwise have been working in the rice paddies ended up being able to get jobs,” Kristof said. “And it created this virtuous spiral of development — so that after 22 years, this village is so much better off than the others.”
During the event, Kristof said he once purchased two Cambodian prostitutes from a brothel and freed them from sex slavery, an issue he said was “high on his agenda.”
In addition to the plights of women in foreign nations, Kristof said there are large gender equality problems in the United States, especially with the issue of sex trafficking.
“We also have to recognize that while trafficking tends to be worse in other countries, we have a huge problem here,” Kristof said. “And we don’t have the moral ground to reject what other countries are doing when we are doing the same thing here. We think about sex trafficking as foreign women who are being smuggled into the U.S., but I think the worst part of it is the domestic side of it.”
Kristof said one of his most important goals is to motivate college students to immerse themselves in social work abroad, which he argues is crucial to a well-rounded education.
“It’s so important to get students out of their comfort zones,” Kristof said. “One way of doing that is to go abroad — but if you go with other students, you might not necessarily be getting out of your comfort zone … It is so important as a part of your education to immerse yourself for a time in a part of the world that you wouldn’t otherwise encounter.”
Many students at the event took Kristof’s advice to heart. Bo Lee, a junior majoring in international relations, said hearing about Kristof’s work will inspire her when she studies abroad next semester in Cape Town, South Africa.
“Listening to what Mr. Kristof said about going out of your comfort zone to make a difference really struck me,” Lee said. “It’s something that I’ll remember when I’m in a foreign country that has inequality — something that will encourage me to try to change the world.”

As the final day of the 2012 election cycle winds to a close Tuesday, students still have several opportunities to get politically involved.
Students registered to vote in Los Angeles can take advantage of free trams to each polling location. Additionally, Yellow Cab will offer free rides to anyone on their way to the polls with the code “LA Vote.”
After the polls close, students can follow the results at a live screening, which will be held in the Ronald Tutor Campus Center courtyard.
USC Political Student Assembly, USC College Democrats and the USC College Republicans all coordinated the 5 p.m. event, which is meant to keep students engaged in the election through the announcement of the winner of the race. The Jesse M. Unruh Institute of Politics, USC Annenberg’s Center on Communication Leadership and Policy, USC Price’s Bedrosian Center on Governance and Public Enterprise, Undergraduate Student Government and Program Board are also co-sponsoring the event.
Audience members will be able to watch the results live, as well as hear Dan Schnur, director of the Jesse M.  Unruh Institute, break down each state’s significance to the race.
Students and staff attending the screening will also receive a ticket redeemable for a meal from Seeds. Obama supporters with a ticket can redeem it for Chicago chili in a bread bowl or a Chicago-style hot dog, while Romney supporters have their choice of Massachusetts clam chowder in a bread bowl or a homestyle peanut butter and jelly sandwich.
Traditions will offer a “Two Party Tea” cocktail for $5 in either blue or red, depending on the customer’s political party of choice, and half-off appetizers for anyone with an “I Voted” sticker.
The event will also feature photo opportunities with life-size cutouts of both candidates.

Brandon Spencer, a 20-year-old security guard from Inglewood, pleaded not guilty Monday to four counts of attempted murder in connection with an on-campus shooting last Wednesday, prosecutors told the Los Angeles Times.
Spencer allegedly opened fire after he became engaged in a verbal dispute with Geno Hall, a former football player at Crenshaw High School, at an Oct. 31 party promoted by LA Hype in association with the Black Student Assembly. Hall sustained several gunshot wounds in his leg, thigh, stomach and buttocks, Hall’s father told the Times. Spencer’s lawyer told reporters that his client was scheduled to begin taking classes at UCLA to become an emergency medical technician on Monday, according to City News Service.
Prosecutors believe Spencer, who also wounded three others outside the Ronald Tutor Campus Center, is affiliated with a gang. None of the victims from Wednesday’s incident were affiliated with USC, and the three unintended victims were transported to California Hospital Medical Center, where they were reportedly expected to make a full recovery.
A preliminary hearing has been set for Dec. 6, according to ABC News. If convicted, Spencer will face up to life in prison. Bail was set at $2.04 million, according to City News Service.
Student leaders from BSA, the Undergraduate Student Government and USC Program Board have issued statements in response to the incident as well as a letter to the Daily Trojan that states that BSA will suspend social events for the remainder of the semester and that Program Board will increase scrutiny on outside organizations for co-sponsored events.

Former judge Vaughn R. Walker discussed his role deciding often controversial cases as a part of the Justice Lester W. Roth Lecture series Monday.
Civil rights · Judge Vaughn Walker, who had a crucial role in deciding the Perry v. Brown case about the legality of Proposition 8, speaks about gay rights at a lecture Monday. – Arya Harsono | Daily Trojan
Walker served on the United States District Court for the Northern District of California as a district judge from 1989 to 2010, and ruled in such momentous cases as the Apple Computer Inc. v. Microsoft Corporation copyright infringement case, the various cases regarding the Terrorist Surveillance Program of the National Security Agency and Perry v. Brown, a challenge to Proposition 8.
Walker, who retired in 2011, allowed himself to speak freely of the Perry v. Brown case (formerly referred to as Perry v. Schwarzenegger), which he previously refused to comment on as an active judge in the legal dispute.
The 2010 case involved deciding the legality of Proposition 8, which recognized marriage solely as the union between a man and woman in California. Walker ruled that Prop. 8 was unconstitutional under the Due Process and Equal Protection Clauses of the United States Constitution.
As soon as the case reached his desk, Walker said he knew the case would be a dramatic one.
“I remember going through the stack of complaints on that day and noticed the name Schwarzenegger and thought, ‘This will be interesting,’” he said.
While Perry v. Brown was being discussed in the district court, many states around the country were also ruling on laws regarding same-sex marriage.
“A step forward, a step backward,” Walker said of the pro-gay rights laws that would be passed in one state and the anti-gay rights law that would be passed months later in another.
The lecture focused sharply on the “rapidly evolving situation with respect to marriage equality,” as Walker put it. Walker also provided background on the evolution of gay rights and discussed the impact of the positive changes that have been made in the last 50 years.
“Today … it’s hard to escape gays and lesbians in popular culture,” Walker said of the visible change in the presence of homosexuals in society.
As Walker noted, some 3 to 3.5 percent of the population openly identified as gay or lesbian in the 2010 census.
“We’re talking about 10, 12 million people … well, that’s not an insignificant number of people,” he said.
Along with the struggles of the gay community to fight for their rights, Walker noted how the fight for sexual orientation equality is essentially no different than the fight for gender equality. If someone can’t be denied a job based on his or her gender, Walker argued, marriage shouldn’t be any different.
Hey Bob McKinnon: This is the 21st century. There is no reason to pay any attention to a superstitious book that presents a primitive, crude, and sexist moral code. The Bible and its “punishments” are irrelevant to the Constitution of our country. If you want to live in a theocracy, then move to Iran or someplace similar.

USC coach Lane Kiffin is disappointed because of well, you know, his team’s record.
“With the players that we have, we should not be 6-3,” he said during his weekly conference call with reporters Sunday night.
That’s rather clear.
Once ranked atop the Associated Press top-25 poll, the Trojans are now nearly out of it entirely, falling to No. 21 after back-to-back losses to Arizona and Oregon.
Should they in fact finish the season outside the top 25, they would become the first preseason AP No. 1 team to finish the season unranked in 48 years, when Ole Miss went 5-5-1 during the 1964 season.
Though a trip to the Pac-12 championship game, a berth in the Rose Bowl and a top-10 finish are all still technically in play, because of such astronomically high preseason expectations, 2012 will always — at least on some level — be given the dubious distinction as one of the most disappointing seasons in program history. Fair or not, that will be the perception.
Here’s an attempt to explain what went wrong, at least through the first nine games.
Schematically, something is still off on defense
The most glaring problem for USC remains its defense. Counting the last two games, the Trojans have surrendered a total of 101 points and 1,318 yards of offense. The Ducks set various USC opponent single-game records Saturday for points, total yards and seemingly everything else. So it comes as little surprise that for the second-straight season a sizable portion of the fan base is calling upon Kiffin to fire his father, assistant head coach for defense Monte Kiffin, or at least suggest retirement.
Last season, coaches attributed the “growing pains” to inexperience. The elder Kiffin suggested USC’s defense needed more time to develop and better grasp the nuanced system. And for the final weeks of 2011, it looked like something was working; the trajectory pointed upward.
But Lane and Monte arrived in January 2010, and to maintain  “our guys need more time” would be a bit delusional considering we’re now 34 games into the Kiffins’ tenure.
So, it might be time to reboot the system
“We have to re-evaluate the whole thing,” Monte said Saturday night after the game. “I totally agree with that.”
Asked if a philosophical change was in order, Lane added: “We’ve got to look at what we’re doing, obviously.”
Something needs to be fixed — and what exactly needs fixing is probably above the pay grade of a college sportswriter.
Summer roster defections 
Over a span of 30 days in late July and August, USC lost two of its most important returners on defense in senior defensive end Devon Kennard and senior cornerback Isiah Wiley. Kennard, who has 135 career tackles, tore his pectoral muscle while weightlifting on the eve of training camp and is redshirting this season as a result. Wiley, who started the final six games in 2011 opposite Nickell Robey, was declared academically ineligible in August and lost his scholarship this season as a result.
Factor both players, particularly Wiley, into the rotation and some of the defensive issues on display in recent weeks are alleviated. The team’s problems on this side of the ball aren’t just limited to schematics — personnel, or the lack thereof, factors in too.
Experience hasn’t been evident
National pundits listed experience as one reason for USC’s lofty preseason ranking, evidenced by the nine returning starters on offense and the addition of junior Silas Redd, a transfer from Penn State. But despite that makeup, they have looked undisciplined for much of the season. Though the Trojans committed just three penalties versus Oregon, they have been penalized a total of 86 times this season, ranking last among 124 Football Bowl Subdivision teams.
Penalties have either stalled offensive drives or given the opposition another chance to move the ball downfield. It’s been a well-documented issue, but also one that’s lingered for much of the season and probably cost the team at least one game (see: Arizona).
The offense has had its lulls 
Counting some basic overlying statistics, USC’s offense meets the billing. Yes, it can score with the best of them and put up plenty of points even in a loss as seen last Saturday. On the season, USC averages 37 points and 465 yards per game. But these numbers are slightly misleading given the unit’s uneven performances.
Senior quarterback Matt Barkley has thrown 10 interceptions through nine games and it’s become increasingly likely he’ll surpass his single-season high of 14 set during his freshman season in 2009. Moreover, with those 10 interceptions, the team ranks 84th nationally in this category. And as for fumbles lost, it’s had 11 — 103rd nationally. For every big play, seemingly a fumble or interception is soon to follow.
Too many distractions? 
It’s funny, in a sense. USC’s slogan in the months leading up to the season opener against Hawai’i was “prep not hype.” The phrase was even painted on the sidelines at Howard Jones Field, but for much of the fall, there’s been one controversy after another instead. So much for a mellow scene.
In mid-September, USC barred Los Angeles Daily News beat writer Scott Wolf from practice after he reported sophomore kicker Andre Heidari had undergone knee surgery. The ban was later lifted.
A week later, Lane Kiffin stormed out of a post-practice news conference after a reporter inquired about an injured player’s return to practice.
“We made a mountain out of a molehill on the injury reporting, and I told [Lane] that,” USC athletic director Pat Haden said in an interview with the Los Angeles Times last month.
In October, USC also received quite a bit of attention for swapping jersey numbers, a potential NCAA rule violation, during its game against Colorado. Redshirt freshman quarterback Cody Kessler wore No. 35, the number of punter Kyle Negrete, during an extra point conversion. He usually sports No. 6.
None of these incidents alone were particularly alarming, but added up, it seems all the more the puzzling.
Maybe Lane Kiffin can’t exist without controversy? Maybe he’s just creative? Maybe he’s just trying too hard?
With a bevy of talent on USC’s, these all appear to be distractions that should have been avoided.

Offensively, I was hoping that, since we exceeded all expectations with the offensive line last year, they would be a dominating force with so many line men to choose from. I know we have a great coach for these players considering we had back to back first draft picks.
Defensively, during the pre-season most folks were talking about how great the defensive backfield was performing under their new coach. I believe his name is coach Sanders. They had been saying we were at least two deep at each position, yet what happened here?

If it felt like Oregon running back Kenjon Barner kept his jersey clean most of Saturday night and ran his 38 carries with little resistance, it’s because he did. Barner gained 273 yards before contact against USC — 12 more yards than he registered in that category in his previous five Pac-12 contests combined.
Records galore · One week after setting the Pac-12 receiving record, Marqise Lee broke another Pac-12 mark with 251 kickoff return yards. – Sean Roth | Daily Trojan
“It’s disappointing after playing them so well last season for three quarters,” USC coach Lane Kiffin said of the disastrous defensive performance.
Despite the latest humbling figure to emerge out of the 62-51 loss to the Ducks, Kiffin, in his weekly conference call with the media, praised two overshadowed facets of the game: the Trojans’ containment of all-purpose weapon De’Anthony Thomas and special teams play.
Thomas carried the ball three times for just only yards and caught five receptions for 59 yards and a touchdown.  The game marked the third fewest combined receiving and rushing yards Thomas has posted in 2012, behind his 29 yards at Arizona State and his 59 yards against Arizona.
The Trojans’ kickoff coverage against Thomas was arguably even more impressive. USC clearly schemed to kick the ball deep into the end zone for touchbacks in order to keep the ball out of Thomas’ hands, but on the three occasions he did return the ball, the former Crenshaw High School star averaged only 22.7 yards.
“We did a great job of coverage with obviously a very dangerous returner in De’Anthony — to limit him to 136 yards combined on offense and special teams,” Kiffin said.
Sophomore wide receiver Marqise Lee — Thomas’ counterpart — set a Pac-12 record with 251 kickoff return yards. Of course, the record represents a double-edged sword, because it’s mostly the product of his fielding several kickoffs after touchdowns. Still, in 2012, Lee leads all Pac-12 kickoff returners with a 29.43 yards-per-return average, which is nearly three yards more than second-ranked UCLA wide receiver Damien Thigpen’s 26.86 average.
Amazingly, Lee has recorded 877 total all-purpose yards in his last two games.
“I don’t know that you can ever imagine a kid having two games like we’ve seen,” Kiffin said. “I don’t think Reggie [Bush] ever even put two games back-to-back together like that.”
Lee could have added eight yards to that total when senior quarterback Matt Barkley threw him an eight-yard fade to the back of the end zone on a first-and-goal on the Trojans’ second offensive series. Unfortunately for USC, Oregon cornerback Ifo Ekpre-Olomu intercepted Barkley.
A day later, Kiffin was still perplexed that Ekpre-Olomu was not flagged for pass interference on the play.
“We can’t turn the ball over, though I’m sure everyone that was watching saw pass interference on the interception,” Kiffin said.
When asked about the play after the game at the press conference, Lee hesitantly remarked that it was “great defense,” to which Kiffin brusquely responded, “Quit it with the ‘great defense.’”

By the end of last season, the USC men’s basketball team had been so ravaged by injuries that it barely resembled the team that had taken the court just months earlier.
All systems go · After an injury-ravaged 2011-12 season, USC men’s basketball will benefit from senior forward Aaron Fuller’s return from last year’s season-ending shoulder injury. – Chris Pham | Daily Trojan
With four of their five starters suffering season-ending injuries by the end of January, the Trojans posted the worst record (6-26, 1-17) in the program’s history, sending the team to last place in the Pac-12.
“It was a catastrophe,” USC coach Kevin O’Neill said. “It was kind of like going to a knife fight with a spoon.”
The Trojan freefall began when senior point guard Jio Fontan tore his anterior cruciate ligament in a summer exhibition game in Brazil, causing him to take a medical redshirt year.
Over the next six months, forwards Aaron Fuller and Evan Smith and center Dewayne Dedmon suffered season-ending injuries as well, leaving sophomore guard Maurice Jones as the leader of a squad that featured two walk-ons in a seven-man rotation.
“One by one, we just started falling,” Dedmon said. “It definitely took a toll on the team, as you could see with our record at the end of the year.”
Jones has since transferred to Iowa State after being declared academically ineligible, but Fontan, Fuller and Dedmon are all back this season and are expected to form the backbone of a squad that features five transfers.
“Those guys returning that were hurt are going to have to be a big part of the team,” O’Neill said. “They all feel like they got something to prove now.”
Dedmon, a 7-foot junior who averaged 7.6 points and 5.5 rebounds last year, is a rising NBA prospect that’s expected to carry the team down low.
“He’s a potential pro, so we’re just going to go through him, feed him the ball inside,” Fontan said. “He’s starting to get more of a comfort zone on the offensive end.”
Last January, Dedmon tore his medial collateral ligament after a Colorado player fell onto his knee, leaving the Trojans with only one player taller than 6-foot-6 on the active roster.
“It was [the] nail in the coffin,” O’Neill said. “We knew we couldn’t compete without him.”
After rehabbing for several months, Dedmon was cleared for all basketball activities over the summer.
“I didn’t have to have surgery, so that was a blessing,” Dedmon said. “I just had to wait until the swelling went down so I could start working on my flexibility.”
Fuller, a redshirt senior who averaged 10.6 points and 5.9 rebounds last year, wasn’t as fortunate.
After injuring both of his shoulders last summer, Fuller played through the pain for a few months before aggravating his left shoulder against UCLA on Jan. 15. Surgery and six months of daily physical therapy followed.
“I was working out a bunch of small muscles that I didn’t even really know I had,” Fuller said.  “I just really wanted to get it healed and get ready for this year.”
According to Fontan, Fuller is back in full force.
“He’s still banging and aggressive as usual,” Fontan said. “His aggressive nature helps us out, kind of lifts the intensity up of the whole team.”
Fontan himself, however, has taken a bit longer to fully recover from his torn ACL — he’s still held out of a few drills for precautionary reasons, but isn’t anticipated to be limited in the season opener on Friday against Coppin State.
O’Neill still expects Fontan to lead the Trojans’ resurgence after the team crumbled without him last year.
“Last year in Brazil when he got hurt, we knew our season was doomed,” O’Neill said. “I’m just really looking forward to him having a big year. I think it’s going to be one of those years where he just breaks out and has a great go of it.”
O’Neill hasn’t finalized USC’s starting lineup outside of Fontan and Dedmon. But he’s confident that if the injury bug bites again this year, the Trojans are better equipped to swat it away.
“We might have the best depth in the country,” O’Neill said. “We have more size, more veterans… It’s a completely different team. We have a lot of work to do and we got a long way to go, but we have a good starting point.”
And there’s at least one Trojan who’s motivated by the memories of the worst year in program history.
“The season we had last year, you don’t want to go back and have a season like that again,” Dedmon said. “We got to come out and show everybody that it’s a different USC team out here.”

Biff, Happy and Willy Loman are nowhere to be found in Death of a Salesgirl, a new play presented by the Bootleg Theater.
As the program boasts, “Bootleg Theater is a space for art.” Since its establishment in 2000, the theater has been committed to creating “brave, boundary-pushing, artistically outstanding and highly collaborative new work.”
Where’s Willy?· Despite its title, Death of a Salesgirl has little in common with the Arthur Miller play. With it’s very absurdist approach, Salesgirl makes for one strange but enjoyable theater-going experience. – | Photo courtesy of Justin Zsebe
Thankfully, the Bootleg Theater has succeeded in this endeavor with Salesgirl.
The space itself is a work of art. Walking into the Bootleg is like walking into a well-filtered Instagram picture. The small, dark lobby gives way to a high-ceilinged warehouse, with a small stage for musical acts on one side and a bar on the other. This area functions as a music venue some nights and as a holding pen for theatergoers others. Industrial sculptures of giant orange tubes and Edison bulbs hang over the heads of attendees. Five minutes before curtain, a metal door swings open and audience members are ushered into the theater (and you can bring your drinks inside!), which actually used to be a bra factory.
The set consists of three walls of a standard hotel room, free of any forced perspective tricks. The walls are bare except for two empty, wooden frames, but the moment the show begins, they become canvases for nonstop projections.
Animation by Dan Lund and other projections by Adam Flemming provide a running reflection of the characters’ actions and emotions during the play. In some scenes, the walls are merely covered in a drab wallpaper pattern, with the frames surrounding stunning animations of birds being conjured in and out of thin air. In others, videos of sprinting actors are projected behind the live actors, and the actors even interact with the projections.
If Death of a Salesgirl has a plot, it is indecipherable. A lot happens in this play, but the way in which the events are related is completely mysterious. Here are the facts: Cat, played by a highly energetic Patricia Scanlon, is a traveling saleswoman who has seen little success lately.
“Sales aren’t what they used to be,” she says over and over.
As she prepares herself for what she hopes will be a “very big day” for her career, the manager of the hotel visits her and warns her not to damage the room. Once he leaves, another man, Frank (Paul Dillon), enters and proceeds to destroy the room over the course of the play.
This play is advertised as a dramedy, and for the first ten minutes, that’s what it is. Scanlon, dressed in a traditional trench coat, enters into a noir soundscape with black and white projections of lightning on the walls. She addresses the audience while drawing ridiculous eyebrows on herself with the intensity of Norma Desmond, explaining that she has just completed a course in “conversational reality.” Once she enters the sphere of the hotel room, she removes her trench coat to reveal a green Girl Scout uniform, complete with dozens of patches and brass pins (the first real hint that this show is about to depart from realism).
As soon as Frank bursts through Cat’s door, the madness really begins. First of all, Frank and Cat’s relationship is murky — are they married? Siblings? Father and daughter? — and is never fully explained. The two of them engage in hardcore emotional and physical combat over the most bizarre little things: When Frank can’t find his lucky rabbit foot or Cat refuses to have a drink with him, they end up chasing each other around the room. In addition, Cat spends half the show worrying over the state of her “samples,” two suitcases full of foot-long blue and white rectangular boxes, and doesn’t mention what they contain until the last five minutes — and even then, it’s not entirely clear what she’s selling. Things get especially weird when densely leafed vines crawl over the corners of the set and through the chest of drawers into the room, taking over the scene but garnering no response from the actors.
Even if absurdist theater isn’t exactly your cup of tea, this play is worth seeing just for the opportunity to watch Scanlon do her thing. She plays Cat with a sort of manic intensity that is both heartbreaking and a little unsettling to watch. Her physical commitment to the character is arresting: She is fearless, extremely versatile and looks like she could be anywhere between 30 and 70 years old.
Ultimately, as is the case with other forms of abstract art, different pieces will resonate with different viewers. Death of a Salesgirl jumps between outrageously funny and nearly sickening to watch in a snap, but it will keep your rapt attention for all 70 minutes. Even if you walk out feeling completely confused, there is no way you’ll forget the experience of seeing this play.

The outcome of the presidential election not only decides the new leader of the country, but also the course of events for the next four years. Each time a new president steps into office, they assume responsibility for decisions that could affect the country far beyond their term.
Street statement · On this brick wall in Los Angeles, street artist Bumboywc puts a new twist on Eddie Adam’s famous Vietnam War photograph of a South Vietnam police chief pointing a gun at a Vietcong prisoner. – Eva Recinos | Daily Trojan
By opening an American history textbook, citizens today can get a play-by-play of each presidential term and the big events during the presidency that changed the course of history. Yet, an artistic reminder might communicate these important moments more quickly and effectively. Through iconic photographs — and by extension, works of art — viewers can look back at America’s best and worst moments. In seeing these time capsules, they can also link past eras’ events with past presidents and their terms.
That power hopefully leads to learning from our mistakes and understanding the things that help the country progress and those that hinder its growth. What artists today should take into consideration is their unique ability to capture certain moments so they will not be forgotten.
Associated Press photographer Eddie Adams caught such a moment during the Vietnam War — one of the most contested, talked-about events in American history — when a South Vietnam police chief blatantly put a gun up to the head of a Vietcong prisoner to kill him. Adams caught the stark violence of the war and, as an American photographer, displayed the involvement of America in Vietnam’s actions.
Today, a reproduction of this image resides on a brick wall in Los Angeles across from a liquor store. The wheatpaste work features only the two major figures in the photograph. Candy corn flies out of the head of the Vietcong man.
The image comes from street artist Bumboywc, whose work tackles everything from politics to popular culture. In a different location, the artist also pasted a work depicting President Barack Obama asking for spare change in a cup, holding up a sign bearing the his 2008 campaign slogan “CHANGE?” with a puppet-Mitt Romney handing him a dollar. As the election draws closer, many street artists have pasted similar images along the streets with the candidates’ images reproduced in a variety of situations.
The image of the Vietcong man shot with candy corn bursting out of his brain might seem dangerously satirical at first, substituting blood for a common Halloween candy. Yet, that very decision might indicate the artist’s message — art shouldn’t focus on just creating creepy pictures for our delight, but also creating haunting pieces, such as Adams’, that will serve as a lasting reminder of the past.
Art is as an important medium for preserving the present for future generations. It also helps current citizens understand just what occurs during their chosen president’s term. Each event that takes place can be recorded and transformed under the aesthetic styles of each artist, as Bumboywc does; if artists decide to engage in the present events of their era they can capture them as a means of getting citizens to think more closely about them. Their art can serve as a means of evaluating the decisions a president makes during his term.
Bumboywc most likely chose the image because of the photo’s familiarity to so many people. That the image survived the passage of decades and remains one of the most recognizable photographs in history indicates that photography exists as an important medium in the art world and visual language doesn’t confine itself to labels — especially when out in the streets.
Street art, in particular, proves a powerful tool for thought. Bumboywc’s decision to paste his work somewhere as routine as a brick wall near a liquor store and a residential area causes passers-by to look twice. When they do, they also might pause to assess America’s history, their own present and the possibilities of the future. Art can reach across demographic categories and affect everyone from the art historian to passers-by that are not even old enough to vote. That power should be taken with care, under the hands of those looking to benefit society, not harm it.
Bumboywc’s street art piece might not last very long — a law official will probably come take it down — but its impact for the period of time it stays up could prove more lasting. Each time that one artist takes a political matter into his or her hands, he or she can inspire others. If a few artists begin to allot more time and attention to current events, others in the art world can start to move in the same direction.
The power of an image can cause both positive and negative effects, in that it captures a moment and evokes emotion quickly. Though artists should not be afraid to tackle current events in their work, art viewers must also approach these works with a critical eye. The new president will be decided today and after that, only time will tell what happens — and, consequently,  how artists decide to record those events.

Wreck-It Ralph, the new Disney Animation feature that came out last weekend, does for video games what Toy Story did for toys and, arguably, what Who Framed Roger Rabbit did for the animated cartoons of old. It achieves the right balance of finding humor in the absurdities of video games and arcades — and with a genuine admiration and heart in the medium.

The approach is notable since, up until recently, video games were still treated as a niche form of entertainment, the equivalent of Dungeons & Dragons or chess club. Before the days of Call of Duty, Madden or Halo, people who played video games were perceived not just as nerds, but as introverted individuals who spent all day hiding in their parents’ basements playing games.
Movies and television shows didn’t do anything to discourage the supposedly fringe culture of video gaming; in fact, this portrayal contributed greatly to that misconception. In most dramas or comedies, if someone played video games they were either kids or stereotypical dorks. This stereotype remains to this day; in television shows such as The Big Bang Theory, the people who play video games are still shown as predominately male, socially awkward and out-of-touch with reality.
This, of course, is inaccurate. According to the Entertainment Software Association, 37 percent of players are actually 36 or older with an average age of 30; meanwhile women make up 47 percent of gamers. This shift in demographics is partly because of the rise of casual gaming and the all-age success of mobile gaming, which has brought in demographics that had simply never played video games before or hadn’t since the days of the Atari. Nowadays, a 70-year-old grandmother is just as likely to be playing a quick round of Angry Birds as a 7-year-old boy.
Regrettably, the film industry has yet to embrace video games as a mainstream aspect of popular culture. This is no more obvious than in movies that have tried to adapt video games, which has mostly proven to be disastrous. Doom, Super Mario Bros., Street Fighter, Wing Commander: There have been so many awful video game movies that studios lack confidence in funding more ambitious adaptations, such as the Peter Jackson-produced Halo movie that fell through.
The fundamental flaw in most video game adaptations is that the screenwriters, directors, and producers not only don’t seem to understand the nuances of the video games they were adapting, but also feel that they can do a “better” job at the story. In the infamous 1993 Super Mario Bros. movie, which some consider one of the worst movies ever made, filmmakers turned the Mushroom Kingdom into a strange subterranean city filled with dinosaur-humanoids with tiny heads. Instead of embracing the quirky and distinctly magical aspects of the franchise, they attempted to Americanize it in the worst way possible.
It’s the same issue that pervaded comic book adaptations for the longest time: Rather than embracing the idiosyncrasies of the material, filmmakers and producers felt that they could improve it by altering it or making it more mainstream. They were never projects that ever felt like they were being made by people who understood or loved what made them work in the first place.
But sometimes it takes a certain film to set a precedent for a respective genre. For comic books, it was Spider-Man. That film and its sequel understood not only what made Peter Parker work, but also embraced the Silver Age attributes and eccentric quality of the characters and the world that the superhero inhabited.
A similar passion project has yet to occur for video game adaptations. It’s not that the task is an easy one; video games, while drastically improved in the storytelling department, are for the most part a series of action sequences with a fundamental stake in interactivity.
For game players, the arcade era held a certain charm. You were going to enjoy yourself, spend a few quarters, switch over to the latest arcade box and compete against your friends in person, which, to this day, still beats competing against someone online. It was as pure as video gaming could be.
Wreck-It Ralph understands this, embraces it and exploits it for laughs.  However, the hilarity doesn’t come from the film patronizing on arcades and video gaming but instead from a charming attitude towards the video game world.  It’s the mark of a good parody, one that, while making fun of the source material, also manages to stand on its own, much like how great friends can make jokes at each other’s expense.
It’s not surprising that the director of Wreck-It Ralph, Rich Moore, worked extensively on the early seasons of The Simpsons and nearly all the episodes of Futurama, which was a similar satirical romp of the science fiction genre.  These series have gone a long way to making insider sci-fi knowledge mainstream.
Though video games have yet to create a defining cinematic adaptation, the latest feature from Disney Animation goes a long way toward making the conventions and quirky details of video games and the arcade era something nostalgic, hilarious and utterly charming to all ages.

After eight years of dabbling in the field of motion capture, Robert Zemeckis returns to live action with Flight.
The USC School of Cinematic Arts alumnus — also known for directing the Back to the Future trilogy and Forrest Gump — took a turn into the field of performance capture, which combines digital technology with live actors to record more subtle aspects of motion and movement, when he directed 2004’s The Polar Express.
Afflicted aviator · Denzel Washington stars as Whip Whitaker in Robert Zemeckis’ latest film, Flight. Given the actor’s recent involvement in thriller films, it’s a nice treat to welcome him back to deeper material. – | Photo courtesy of Robert Zuckerman
But after finishing two additional films in this style, both of which were met with middling critical and financial success, Zemeckis has apparently satisfied fans with a much-awaited return to live-action films in Flight.
Zemeckis chose Flight as his “comeback” project and cast Denzel Washington in the lead role. Written by John Gatins, Flight is the tale of airline pilot Whip Whitaker, who miraculously lands a mechanically defective plane, saving nearly all passengers on board. Investigators soon discover, however, that Whitaker might have been intoxicated during the flight, a crime worthy of prison time. Gatins surrounds this seemingly simple premise with a multitude of heavy themes dealing with addiction, religion and family life.
Predictably, at the very heart of Flight is Washington in his performance as Whitaker. Though a very accomplished dramatic actor with two Academy Award victories, Washington has recently starred in exclusively action thrillers, including this year’s Safe House. As a result, his involvement in a heavier film is refreshing from the start — the performance Washington gives is quite remarkable. Washington infuses Whitaker with a “two-faced” persona, in which one side is selfish and destructive and the other is compassionate and sympathetic. Cleverly, Washington never places too much extremity on either side of the ethical balance. He walks a thin tightrope that forces the audience to constantly question their subjective feelings toward Whitaker’s success.
Of course the mere conceptual characterization of Whitaker in Gatins’ script lays a partially duplicitous foundation, but it is Washington’s nuances that seize this framework and make the film soar. The talented actor exudes a charm that counteracts the destructive abyss Whitaker pushes himself into. Washington’s portrayal adds an aura of complexity to the film, in which the audience can empathize with the protagonist one moment and despise his actions the next. Whitaker’s character is conflicted and struggling throughout the entire narrative, and Washington is able to illustrate this to great effect. Undoubtedly, his name will talked about this upcoming awards season. Perhaps Washington could be in line for an astonishing third statue in a weaker Oscar year.
The performances from the rest of the cast are solid, albeit nothing extraordinarily brilliant with the exception of John Goodman. Playing Whitaker’s best friend Harling Mays, Goodman remains absolutely hilarious and steals the few scenes he’s featured in. Despite the stark tonal disparities between Mays and Whitaker, their interactions are completely enthralling.
For the majority of the run time, Zemeckis remains his revered, award-winning self. Most scenes are directed with an acute realism that reflects the harsh truth of Whitaker’s alcoholism. The early scene depicting the plane crash is particularly phenomenal. The computer generated visuals seem amazingly realistic as Zemeckis truly places the viewer in the experience of a falling aircraft. This portion of Flight matches, in just about every respect, the effective plane-crash scene in his prior film Cast Away. Though he displayed some weaknesses in animated pictures, Zemeckis shows again that he’s one of the best live-action filmmakers today.
The main and utterly damaging flaw of Flight surprisingly lies in Gatins’ script. Though some were excited by the originality and presumed simplicity of story, upon the conclusion of the film it appears Gatins took on much more than he could handle. Supposedly a portrait of the plummeting alcoholic (Whitaker), Flight spends an unnecessary amount of time on other characters who add no depth to Whitaker’s descent. The principal perpetrator of pointlessness is the drug addict, Nicole Maggen, played by Kelly Reilly. Through no fault of Reilly’s — she does a serviceable job — her character is simply not needed. Maggen distracts the audience’s focus from Whitaker and tarnishes the film’s attempt at realism. Every scene she is involved in feels forced and comes off as completely inauthentic.
The plethora of ideas and themes Gatins attempts to incorporate becomes a juggling act of superficial notions rather than a consistent critique of a very horrifying addiction. The occasionally blatant symbols and visual allegories should just hint at Whitaker’s downfall, but they branch off and attack other themes, making Flight seem somewhat convoluted. Gatins’ concept is strong, but his execution is very disappointing. Whatever emotion Washington’s performance incites is completely erased by the absurdities of Gatins’ script.
Ultimately, Washington’s excellent performance makes Flight a moderately compelling drama with some gripping individual moments. Yet taken in totality, the film lacks coherence and the expected emotional punch experienced so frequently in previous Zemeckis films.

Elementary students’ dreams came true last month when French President Francois Hollande promised to ban homework in all of the country’s public schools.
Xingzhou Zhu | Daily Trojan
The announcement was just one part of the newly elected president’s robust educational plan, which attempts to prioritize learning and equalize students’ abilities to succeed. In addition to eliminating take-home assignments, Hollande plans to extend the school week from four days to four and a half days of classroom instruction.
The idea behind the decision to ban homework and increase class time isn’t new: Students from wealthier homes typically have more involved parents and access to resources that give them an unfair advantage over their less-wealthy counterparts.
But though this argument has its merits, it does not justify the changes Hollande is promising.
Using homework as a scapegoat for classroom inequality jeopardizes parent involvement in their child’s academic pursuits. Removing the tool that parents rely on to help their children succeed only caters to less-involved parents. And weakening parents’ roles as at-home educators, Hollande’s proposal hurts the type of overall education that students, particularly younger ones, need to thrive in school and beyond.
Proponents of anti-homework policies argue that many parents simply complete homework for their children, unfairly inflating certain students’ report cards and providing no academic value. Indeed, a Los Angeles Times survey found that 43 percent of parents have done their kids’ homework.
But responsible parent involvement with homework has also proven to be dramatically beneficial to students’ successes. A study of elementary and middle school students by Joyce Epstein, a leading Johns Hopkins University professor on school, family and community partnerships, found that parent involvement drastically boosted sixth and eighth-grade writing scores.
Whether ideal or not, parent involvement in schoolwork might have a positive effect overall. Homework directly corresponds to increased student performance, and it is the most common tool that parents rely on to promote learning. The Institute of Education Sciences found that 65 percent of parents check to make sure that their high school students’ homework is completed each night. And a study conducted by online academic system TeacherEase estimates that missed work drops by 41 percent when parents are involved in their students’ homework.
Despite this wealth of statistics, the trend to equalize the academic playing field is a concept being played with all over the United States. Gaithersburg Elementary School in Maryland recently replaced homework with a mandatory requirement for 30 minutes a day of after-school reading, and charter schools across America are extending their hours.
Just as in America, Hollande plans to extend the school week by adding a half-day on Wednesday, which French students usually have off. But France should take a lesson from its own statistics: More time in school doesn’t correspond with improved performance.
French students already spend more hours per year in school than average — 847, compared with 774 among countries in the Organization for Economic Development and Co-operation, which measures academic performance among almost all developed countries.
Yet France ranks 21st in reading among countries in the OEDC.
In contrast, Finland, which is the third lowest in terms of total classroom instruction per week, according to an OEDC study, has one of the highest-ranked public school systems in the world.
Students with more involved parents or those from wealthier households will always have resources that others do not. Whether it’s access to personal tutors or the privilege of graduating debt-free, it is impossible to eliminate the benefit of wealth or parent investment for certain students. But the overall benefit of homework more than justifies this disparity. Parents have always been, and need to remain, the main conductor of a child’s academic success — and homework allows them to do so.
In the end, Hollande’s regressive proposal will not improve the quality of learning in French public schools, but will only lower academic standards for everyone.

At 12:01 a.m. on Nov. 1, USC students and faculty enjoying Halloween all over Los Angeles received an alert asking them to take “shelter in place and avoid opening doors for unknown persons” because there had been a shooting on campus. Beyond the initial fear that students felt, a bigger question emerged: How did an armed person make it onto USC’s campus?
Last Wednesday’s shooting put a spotlight on the university’s open-campus policy, under which people of no relation to USC are free to roam the campus with access to most buildings. But the incident last week has led USC parents, students and administration to question the university’s open-campus policy. In order to improve on-campus security, a stricter policy needs to be implemented by the USC administration.
In a statement President C. L. Max Nikias issued the day after the shooting, he wrote, “In light of this and other events, campus safety and security has been a major topic of discussion at the highest levels of my administration.”
What’s concerning about this statement is that Nikias clearly notes that there were other events — incidents prior to last week — that should have raised more concern about who is allowed on campus.
Though many people will argue that the shooting is not USC’s fault (as the school simply is in an area with an elevated crime rate), this is no excuse for what happened within USC’s own controllable boundaries. With a closed-campus policy, DPS could be able to monitor who enters and exits the campus, potentially preventing serious crimes such as that of Halloween night. According to CLRSearch’s 2010 Crime Rate Indexes, the murder rate in USC’s zip code, 90007, is more than three times that of the state of California and four times that of the United States overall. With such potential risk surrounding campus, USC needs to be as cautious as possible.
Still, students cannot forget that USC has close ties with the surrounding community, which makes it unwise to close the campus completely. A compromise could be to implement a window of time every day when non-USC persons are free to enter and wander the campus, and then enforce a closed-campus policy after dark. During the day, with so many students, faculty and staff on campus, the chance of a serious crime occurring is lower — and it is a great time for non-USC affiliated persons to have access to our beautiful campus.
According to the U.S. Department of Justice’s website, crimes committed by offenders over 18 years old are most likely to occur during the hours of 9 p.m. to 3 a.m. -— prime hours for students to be studying at hotspots on campus such as Leavey or Doheny Libraries. Monitoring the premises after 9 p.m. could reduce the risk of these crimes occurring when many students are still on campus.
What happened on Halloween was a tragedy. Though a closed campus policy might not have prevented it from happening, it could have lowered the risk of such a crime taking place. Students and parents alike should urge USC’s administration to implement a more rigid policy for who is allowed onto campus — if only to make a solid attempt at improving on-campus safety.

Full agreement.  I have two additional points to offer:  (1)  On-campus social activities should Not be advertised to the community at large; why take any chance attracting strangers?  (2)  The safety of the students if Paramount and the campus is Private, so why not say that Private property and those associated with the university, or with some legitimate purpose, can be allowed; and those who are not associated orwithout legitimate purpose can be asked to leave.
Choose cowardice. Choose fear. Choose a closed campus.
What possible benefit is there to a completely open campus? Many have overreacted to the incident, but these measures have been due for years.
Are you a student? If so, why should this offend you?
If not, well, who cares?
Looks like the administration agrees with you. Campus to be closed 9pm-6am. About time!
Yes!!  The administration HAS to do something to take a stand and help lesson the risk for students on campus and on it’s perimeter.  Enrollment will suffer if this serious security issue is not addressed from a multitude of angles.
Well said!!  I agree completely.
I’ve been saying this for years.
Close it down.
Great article, I completely agree. I hope the administration seriously considers this proposal.

Brandon Spencer, a 20-year-old security guard from Inglewood, pleaded not guilty Monday afternoon to four counts of attempted murder in connection with an on-campus shooting last Wednesday, prosecutors told the Los Angeles Times.
Spencer allegedly opened fire after he became engaged in a verbal dispute with Geno Hall, a former football player at Crenshaw High School, at an Oct. 31 party promoted by LA Hype in association with the Black Student Assembly. Hall sustained several gunshot wounds in his leg, thigh, stomach and buttocks, Hall’s father told the Times.
Prosecutors believe Spencer, who also wounded three others outside the Ronald Tutor Campus Center, is affiliated with a gang. None of the victims from Wednesday’s incident were affiliated with USC, and the three other victims were transported to California Hospital Medical Center, where they were reportedly expected to make a full recovery.
The case will be prosecuted by Deputy District Attorney Antonella Nistorescu of the hardcore gang division.
A preliminary hearing has been set for Dec. 6, according to ABC News. If convicted, Spencer will face up to life in prison.

A 20-year-old Inglewood man, who was arrested last week in connection to an on-campus shooting, has been charged with four counts of attempted murder, the Los Angeles district attorney’s office said Monday.
Authorities said Brandon Spencer opened fire on four people, including former Crenshaw High School football player Geno Hall, at an Oct. 31 party promoted by LA Hype in association with the Black Student Assembly. At least seven gunshots were fired at approximately 11:45 p.m. last Wednesday when one suspect engaged in a physical confrontation with Hall. Hall sustained at least seven gunshot wounds to his left thigh, back of his leg, buttocks and arm, according to the Los Angeles Times. Three other victims were also wounded and transported to California Hospital Medical Center, but are expected to make a full recovery. The complaint alleges that the shooting was to benefit a criminal street gang.
Student leaders from BSA, the Undergraduate Student Government and USC Program Board have issued statements in response to the incident as well as a letter to the Daily Trojan, which states that BSA will suspend social events for the remainder of the semester and that Program Board will increase the scrutiny it places on outside organizations for co-sponsoring events.
Deputy District Attorney Antonella Nistorescu — from the hardcore gang division — will prosecute and ask that bail be set at $2.04 million at an arraignment Monday afternoon. If convicted, Spencer will face up to life in prison.

Following a 62-51 loss on Saturday to No. 3 Oregon, the USC Trojans have dropped to No. 19 in the most recent BCS standings.
The Trojans fought hard in the highly anticipated Pac-12 showdown, but were simply unable to contain the highly explosive Oregon offensive attack, surrendering over 730 yards to the Ducks.
For the second consecutive week, junior receiver Marqise Lee put up big numbers, registering two touchdowns to go along with 408 all-purpose yards. Freshman receiver Nelson Agholor also had a large impact in the game, scoring his first touchdown of the season to cap off a performance in which he accumulated 162 yards receiving, more than half of his season total.
The Trojans also plummeted in both the Associated Press top 25 poll as well as the USA Today coaches’ poll, dropping to No. 21 and No. 22 respectively.
The Pac-12 as a whole has four teams, USC included, currently ranked in the BCS. With the victory over the Trojans, Oregon moved up one spot to No. 3, ahead of Notre Dame. Following a 66-10 dismantling of Arizona, UCLA re-entered the top 25 and now sits one spot ahead of the Trojans at No. 18. In two weeks, the crosstown rivals will face off with bowl implications in a battle for the lead atop the Pac-12 South. Finally, with its shutout victory over Colorado, Stanford remained steady for the second consecutive week and is ranked No. 14 in the BCS standings.
The Trojans return to the field Saturday at the Coliseum against the Arizona State Sun Devils for USC’s homecoming game.
