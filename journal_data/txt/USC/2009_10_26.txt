Taking advantage of almost every public safety resource in the school’s arsenal, a female student who was robbed on campus Monday was able to recover her property and see two suspects arrested.
After nearly a month without a reported robbery at USC, a female student walking through the parking lot behind the University Park Health Center at 12:25 p.m. Monday was robbed by two juvenile males, who shoved her from behind and stole her property.
Thinking quickly, the student followed the two teenagers, who fled the scene with her possessions.
As she pursued the two into the North University Park area, just north of Jefferson Boulevard, she found a yellow-jacketed Contemporary Services Corporation security ambassador, whom she asked for help.
The student and the security ambassador followed the two robbers to the area of Orchard Avenue and Jefferson. The security ambassador contacted the Department of Public Safety via radio, and DPS found the two teenagers in the area of Jefferson and Hoover Street. They were then taken into custody.
DPS Capt. David Carlisle said this incident exemplifies how the CSC security force can help the USC community.
“It is an example of how they can assist us by observing and assisting a citizen,” Carlisle said. “That’s what they’re there for … In this case, it worked out as it was supposed to.”
Carlisle said the capture of the two suspects was also a good example of the type of teamwork DPS and other safety officers strive for.
The CSC security ambassadors are new this semester, and Carlisle said he suspects their presence has contributed to the decrease in crime.
Robberies in broad daylight, like the one Monday, are uncommon, Carlisle noted.
“I might attribute to this act that these were juveniles, so maybe they were a little more bold,” he said. “Fortunately, they’re now in custody.”
In many cases it would be dangerous to follow someone who has robbed you. Is it wise to condone following thieves? Sure, your possessions are nice, and it is important to catch and prosecute thieves, but is it worth risking your life to do it?
Im glad the bad guys are off the street.  Good job DPS and CSC guys, nothing is 100 preventable…but it is good to know people are doing the best they can to prevent it.  Pay attention to your surroundings and be safe.
After reading this article my first reaction was “WOW!” Also it made me think “How safe are we?” I also thought “How safe is life on campus?” an in that case i think that they should have a better security system like have more cameras and more security guards out there so that students feel safer while on campus. Because like if this had happened at my school i would have felt unsafe at school. I think all college students should be aware of what can happen while on campus. The good thing about this article is that the robbers were caught and she got help.
After reading this article, I think that the CSCU campus is not well secured. The female student got her property stolen while she was on campus. This campus should have more cameras to watch out for other thieves. The two juvenile males probably thought that this campus was not well watched, and that they could have gotten away with her belongings easily. This campus should be more protected by securities. If this campus had security guards, then the female would not have gone through the trouble to look for someone. She was vey fortunate to find the security ambassador, and that he helped her receive her property back. This article made me question of how safe we really are because this incident was on a campus, but what if it would have been somewhere else where there was no one to help her.
I think that this article is interesting. It is interesting because a student getting robbed is a common thing with no one around; but with the new security guards there that should prevent anything like that to happen. So what is weird is that they were there on campus but they did not get the robbers until after they did it. Since the security guads are there why did they let them on campus? Nobody is safe no matter who is around the people around you can end up not noticing whats going on around them. So I think that they should either get more security guards or not let anyone but the students on the campus.
Maybe they should have more people going around campus, making sure everything’s okay. I really don’t know what to say about this. What happens, happens. You can’t really stop it. It’s their decision what they want to do and they most likely won’t listen to you if you tell them not to do something. You do something you want to do, right? You don’t just go out there and do something you think it lame. So to me, I don’t think there’s anything to do about this to make anything better except maybe more people going around campus. But what I don’t get, is that all those students at USC are there all for one reason: Education. If you’re smart enough to think about your future and how you want your life to be like, I don’t see why they would want to screw it up now by robbing someone. They caught the suspects and the lady who was robbed got her stuff back. So their plan didn’t even work. They just got in trouble for something they thought was cool or fun. That’s what I have to say.
After reading this article i can concluded that no one in the world is safe. This college students was robbed while being at campus..??WOW i think thats crazy.Maybe you guys should have more people watching out or even have cameras around.The students should be aware of the situations they can go through while being  on campus. The only good thing was that they were able to catch the robber but just because the victum found someone that could help.We can say she was just in luck.But take in mind what will happen next time that someone gets robb and theres no one around to help.
In this article it is very interesting by the way that the woman that got her purse stolen and managed to follow the two juvenile guys and got her purse back. The most exciting part of this article was when the lady finally found a yellow vest security guard and started to chase those two guys. Those guys should be sued and apologize to the lady. The cscu campus from reading this article has made me think that it is very well secure and has wonderful security guards. I can connect to this article because I was once a security guard for a corn maze and it is amazing to see the person reaction when they’ve lost something.

Sometimes the shrewdest businessman in the room is the one wearing a Goofy cap.
Seventy-two-year-old Charles Franklin has been selling souvenir football programs at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum for nearly six decades now.
Constant presence · Charles Franklin, 72, has been selling  souvenir football programs at the Coliseum for the last 60 years. - Tim Tran | Daily Trojan
In those six decades, Franklin has been consistent in both his location and his headwear.
Franklin, who always sets up in front of Tunnel 21, has worn his signature Goofy hat to every home USC football game since he got it eight years ago. And while the floppy ears dangling over his temples and the brown pom-pon nose don’t appear to be all that relevant to his job selling programs, he says he knows what he’s doing.
“I wear [the hat] all the time,” Franklin said, “because it draws the crowd. They like it, and all the customers enjoy seeing the Goofy cap.”
Despite suffering severe brain trauma in his youth and being diagnosed with Parkinson’s disease in 1968, Franklin has carved out a satisfying life for himself, working a series of odd jobs throughout Los Angeles.
A Beverlywood native now living just outside of Downtown, Franklin began selling programs at the Coliseum in 1952, at the age of 15. Over the years, he’s seen multiple teams pass through the famed stadium. Most of them — including UCLA and the since-relocated Los Angeles Rams NFL franchise — spent less time at the Coliseum than Franklin has.
His consistent attendance has made him a fixture at the Coliseum.
“He can only remember one time when he was sick,” said John Heil, a close friend who lived with Franklin in a boarding house in the mid-Wilshire district in 1971.
Despite his age and his illness, Franklin is able to function well almost on his own, though he does need help with certain things.
“He doesn’t drive and he doesn’t cook meals in his own apartment,” Heil said.
Sometimes the hand tremors associated with his Parkinson’s disease prove to be an impediment to his program distribution, but it’s rarely enough to keep him out of work.
Franklin seems more than aware of his status as a game day staple at the Coliseum.
He has met USC coach Pete Carroll (“Yeah, he seemed nice and everything,” Franklin said) and, according to Heil, was once made an honorary Trojan Knight.
When asked if he thought people would be disappointed if he were not at a game, Franklin answered only “yes.”
Come two hours before kick-off on any given game day, Franklin can be found picking up the 125 programs he’s allotted, stationing himself in front of Tunnel 21 and situating himself to project his voice to any fans within earshot.
While Tunnel 21 isn’t actually part of the Coliseum’s designated student section seating, generations of Trojans have become acquainted with the high-voiced pitchman hollering from his place just outside the breezeway.
Jeff Michel, a USC alumnus who lives in Long Beach, was one of those students. He said he knew of Franklin while in school, but only now feels as if he knows the man beneath the hat.
“I was a freshman in ’71, and then we’d be walking over to the Coliseum for the games, and I’d see him,” Michel, now a regular customer of Franklin’s, said.
Several years later, in 1997, Michel tried to reach out to Franklin by offering him some extra work.
“I was in the tunnel and I started talking to him and I gave him my business card,” Michel said. “By Monday morning … I had [received] three pages from him within a five-minute period. And I go, ‘Oh boy, he’s a very, very persistent fellow.’”
According to Michel, Franklin has an affinity for collecting business cards and forging contacts.
“He’s an incredible networker,” Michel said.
Franklin acts as if he’s in a current state of unemployment, never withdrawing from the job hunt for even a second. He’s also not above using transparent marketing ploys, like the popular hat, to turn a profit, Michel said.
To keep busy, Franklin also holds a five-day-a-week job Downtown.
“He does odd jobs over in the Cal Mart building down in the Garment District, including picking up the company’s mail and delivering their mail,” Michel said. “His favorite job is stuffing envelopes.”
Though many Franklin’s age would be considering retirement, Franklin says he has no plans of stopping. While he cites the turkey sandwiches and grilled chicken at the International House of Pancakes and Denny’s as one of his favorite ways to spend his earnings, he isn’t holding onto his jobs strictly as a means to finance his diner habit.
More than his need for money, Franklin needs work to fill his days.
“With Charles, it’s more of a self-image building thing: Always stay busy,” Michel said. “He’s got an incredible work ethic.”
No matter what else the future may hold for Franklin, it’s likely going to involve shouting the words “souvenir program” to USC football fans. As long as there are programs to be sold to adoring patrons, he’ll be there.
“He’s a lovable character,” Michel said. “He’s a real survivor.”
It’s a Pluto hat, I know.
Good journalistic instincts to do this story!  Good job, Louis!

Every Wednesday from 12:30 to 2:30 p.m., Undergraduate Student Government President Holden Slusher sits at a table on Trousdale Parkway, ready and waiting to answer questions about USG.
“Anyone can come into my office hours, but we all know walking into a foreign office is intimidating, so that’s why it’s important to have it on Trousdale,” Slusher said.
Slusher’s tabling, along with tabling by Vice President Ashlie Chan and a few USG senators, is part of an effort to reinvent USG’s public relations campaign and address concerns about students’ lack of familiarity with the organization.
“We know that students know that we’re here, but what I want to do specifically is make what we actually do, whether that’s the events we plan or what we advocate for to administrators, [visible] to students,” said Paige Hill, senior director of communications for USG. “I don’t want to be just an organization that exists, I want students to know what we do on campus, and to increase student involvement.”
With a wide-ranging list of events and activities that often receive very little attention from students, USG’s communications department has always had to come up with new ways of reaching out to students.
Former USG Vice President Tony Jercinovich said the 2009-2010 administration’s tabling initiative is a step up from last year’s public relations efforts, which focused primarily on maintaining connections with campus media and reaching students through email listservs and conversations with their senators.
Although last year’s officials tabled on Trousdale on an occasional basis, Jercinovich said he and other executive officers could have taken greater advantage of these techniques.
“It may have been more useful to get out among students,” he said. “One of the major challenges USG faces every year is making itself known to the student body and even beyond that, that we provide a lot of services and we’re actually there to listen to what students have to say.”
Charged with finding the most effective way to achieve this, USG’s communications department — including Hill, three assistant directors and Director of Outreach Chris Cheng, whose position is new this year — began its work over the summer with a focus on increasing USG’s social media presence and developing projects to be implemented during the fall semester.
To help the communications department accomplish the new goals, the administration gave it a $5,000 boost in its overall budget for the year, USG Treasurer Ashwin Appiah said. The total communications department budget is $35,000.
Those funds were redirected from the elections and recruitment committee budget after the administration determined USG’s annual elections carnival was no longer a sound investment, Slusher said.
“[Last year] the elections carnival didn’t have that large of a turnout. It was mostly grad students, and not that that’s bad, but it’s not doing what it’s supposed to,” Slusher said. “So we gave that money to communications, and we wanted to make sure that we could do other things like [last Tuesday’s promotional event] the Hallowiener as a gift to students and to show them that we’re here for them.”
The budget increase has allowed the communications department to program more promotional events like the Hallowiener — a USG-sponsored event held at Tommy Trojan that featured free food from Wienerschnitzel and a chance for students to meet USG executive officers, Hill said. In previous years, the department was rarely able to host events focused primarily on promotion due to its smaller budget, she added.
Dannie Taylor, a junior majoring in communication and sociology, said the redirection of funds to events like Tuesday’s Hallowiener would help USG connect more to the student body.
“I don’t see a problem with [the increased public relations budget] if it helps reach out to students because groups like USG will often be doing something, but students won’t know about it,” she said.
But other students believe the budget increase is not the best use of students’ money.
“I don’t understand why it’s necessary for them to have promotions,” said John Scott Gibney, a junior majoring in cinema-television production. “[The money] should be going more toward resources for students, like KSCR.”
Besides communications efforts, the added funds have also contributed to USG’s outreach initiatives.
According to Slusher, the volume of projects and responsibilities falling under the communications department was often too much for the department’s director to handle alone, so they created the new director of outreach position necessary to better pinpoint and respond to concerns like Gibney’s.
Cheng said he and his committee are working to assess what students want from USG and to make those requests a reality.
“My job isn’t just to be a trophy boy, but it’s more for people to know we’re here to help,” Cheng said. “It’s more for students to know we’re a resource, and they can give their input to see the change they want to see in the university.”
Outreach committee initiatives include promotional street teams, comprised of students from different housing complexes on and around USC’s campus, and the planned Council of Presidents, which will invite the presidents of student organizations to learn about USG’s advocacy efforts and to provide feedback. The Council of Presidents is scheduled for November.
Aside from working to increase USG’s campus presence, the communications department has focused on creating an online presence for itself with a Twitter account and Facebook event invitations.
The department has also added a virtual suggestion box to the USG website and has distributed its weekly event summary, known as the Week-In-Brief, more frequently. In September, USG also began webcasting its weekly Senate meetings to improve the organizations’ transparency.
Many of the communications department’s efforts have also gone toward more visible branding, which places the USG logo on items such as T-shirts, tote bags, sunglasses and highlighters, and uses these items as giveaways during events.
Some students, like Ryan Woods, a junior majoring in cinema-television production, said the public relations changes have given them a better sense of USG’s role on campus.
“I feel like they have more of a presence this year than last year,” he said. “I feel like I’ve just seen their name out there more, like in [Daily Trojan] headlines.”
But for students like Gibney, USG’s increased public relations efforts have not changed their view of the organization’s purpose or reach on campus.
“It’s pretty much the same. I’m part of a student club, so I’ve heard their name for funding, but outside of that, nothing,” Gibney said.
Hill said she hopes to affect perceptions of USG by conducting frequent surveys to gather student feedback on the new initiatives and altering public relations methods accordingly. The communications department also plans to host another promotional meet-and-greet event similar to the Hallowiener in the spring, Hill added.
“It’s a constant battle. As much as students want to know what USG is and what it does, there are avenues to do that but they opt out of them, but you have to respect what they want,” she said. “Until you’re involved in the organization, until you’re involved in USG, you’re not going to care.”

With the midpoint of the season in the rearview mirror, college football award speculation is in full swing. Let the complaining begin.
Monday’s announcement of the semifinalists for the Davey O’Brien Award for quarterbacks drew a few surprised looks when USC’s Matt Barkley made the cut. For all of his accomplishments, Barkley has the fewest touchdown passes of the 15 signal-callers on the list.
Snubbed · Despite his stellar play, USC’s Damian Williams is not a semifinalist for the Biletnikoff Award, given to the nation’s top receiver. - Dieuwertje Kast | Daily Trojan
But Barkley’s inclusion as a semifinalist wasn’t Monday’s biggest awards injustice.
Despite being named the Pac-10 Special Teams Player of the Week for his performance against Oregon State, wide receiver Damian Williams was left off the list of semifinalists for the Fred Biletnikoff Award. After all of the memorable games and plays that the redshirt junior has had, it’s hard to argue that he hasn’t staked his claim as one of the country’s best receivers.
The statistics don’t work to Williams’ favor. He has fewer receptions and receiving yards than all of the 10 receivers that made the list.
But many of the semifinalists play on pass-happy teams that force the ball to their top playmaker. And among those in competition for the award, only Texas’ Jordan Shipley and Cincinnati’s Mardy Gilyard play for a top-10 team like Williams.
Think back to almost any USC game this season. The likelihood is that somewhere along the way, Williams made a key contribution that gave the Trojans an important edge.
“Damian has been tremendous for us,” USC coach Pete Carroll said after defeating Oregon State. “When he has his chances, he’s just a big play guy.”
As consistent as Williams has been, his most recent performances may be his most impressive. His 66-yard punt return for a touchdown against Cal helped deliver the knockout blow to the Golden Bears. Against Notre Dame, he made a 41-yard screen pass for a touchdown look easy with a little help from fellow receiver Brice Butler.
And on Saturday against Oregon State, his sideline dash to the end zone ended up being the difference in USC’s 42-36 win.
“The punt return was exhilarating,” Carroll said. “I thought it was one of the plays of the year.”
Williams now has two punt returns for touchdowns on the season, becoming the first USC player to achieve that feat since some guy named Reggie Bush. But if the Biletnikoff Award wants to look at his credentials strictly as a pass catcher, Williams has plenty to show off there as well.
Consider his impact on a USC offense that is just now finding its stride. Through seven games, Williams has 34 catches — or eight more than the rest of the USC wide receivers combined. Even when you include catches by tight ends and running backs, Williams is accountable for roughly 30 percent of the USC passing offense’s production so far.
Barkley has received most of the fan adulation so far this year, but given all the close games the quarterback has been a part of and his reliance on Williams, maybe some of that praise should be going to the deserving wide receiver.
With wide receiver Ronald Johnson sidelined for the early part of the year with a broken collarbone, Williams had to do most of the heavy lifting for the receiving corps. After Johnson announced his return with 99 yards receiving against Oregon State, Williams might have another partner in crime split out wide.
“Damian’s always going to be open,” Johnson said after Saturday’s win. “He does whatever he has to do on the other side, so now I just have to get open, too.”
The job description of “doing whatever he has to do” has included being a well-rounded receiver. Williams is a willing and able blocker in the run game. Against Washington State, he helped spring Joe McKnight for a 21-yard gain with a near perfect block that was called holding in the infinite wisdom of Pac-10 referees. Carroll took issue with the bogus call, but Williams humbly shrugged it off.
In all, it’s not surprising that Williams was left off the list of Biletnikoff semifinalists — just disappointing. He likely won’t end up with inflated stats like many of his pass-catching counterparts to garner the kind of national attention he deserves.
But if college football aficionados keep watching for the rest of the season, maybe they’ll keep an open mind for once.

The No. 6 USC women’s golf team fell from eighth to 16th on the final day of the NCAA Fall Preview in Wilmington, N.C. for its worst finish in five seasons.
A final round of 31-over-par — the worst of any team for any round in the tournament — sealed the Women of Troy’s fate after leading the first day. The team finished at 52-over 916 (288-309-319), 35 strokes behind first-place Duke at 17-over 881 (296-297-288).
Back in action · In her return to competition, Lizette Salas led the way for the Women of Troy, finishing tied for 12th place. Without standout Jennifer Song, however, the team placed a disappointing 16th. - Photo courtesy of USC Sports Information
The Women of Troy were without top golfer Jennifer Song, currently in South Korea preparing for the Hana Bank-KOLON Championship, a Ladies Professional Golf Association tournament.
The team was led by junior All-American Lizette Salas, who finished tied for 12th in her return to competition. After missing the previous tournament for a wedding, Salas came back with a four-over 220 (72-75-73) to finish 10 strokes back of tournament-winner Cydney Clanton of Auburn.
Senior All-American Belen Mozo was tied with Salas at three-over through two rounds, but had to withdraw on the last day.
“Towards the end of the second round, she had a lie in the rough, and I think she jarred her shoulder,” USC coach Andrea Gaston said.
Four holes into the fourth round, Mozo called Gaston over, and explained the situation.
“She told me, ‘It’s kind of cold out and I don’t know if I should try to play on this, because my shoulder is really hurting,’ and I told her that we didn’t need any heroics right now,” Gaston said.
Her withdrawal left the team with only four players, meaning USC had to accept all scores instead of dropping the highest. Mozo, ranked ninth individually coming into the season, has struggled with a shoulder injury since last year, which forced her to have shoulder surgery over the summer.
Sophomore Inah Park finished tied for 50th at 13-over 229 (72-76-81). Senior Caroline Kim finished tied for 70th at 20-over 236 (73-82-81). Senior All-American Stephanie Endstrasser tied for 79th at 26-over 242 (75-83-84) in her season debut.
The tournament, held at the Country Club of Landfall’s Pete Dye Course, was designed to give teams a good look at the course which will host the national championship in June 2010.
The Women of Troy broke a 32-tournament streak of top-10 finishes, dating back to the 2005 NCAA Championship, when the team finished 11th. In both tournaments the Women of Troy led after the first day, only to fall from the top 10.
The team looks to rebound this weekend in Hawaii at the Turtle Bay Collegiate Invitational, its final tournament of the fall. The roster is up in the air, as Song is still in South Korea and Mozo may not be able to play.
Besides the roster uncertainties, there’s not much time to practice before leaving.
“We’re a fairly decent ball striking team, but we need to work on our short game and putting,” Gaston said. “We need to work twice as hard on that, because that’s where mental toughness comes in, as you don’t hit every green or make every putt.”

For the second year in a row, USC junior Maria Sanchez captured the Wilson/ITA Southwest Regional championship Monday in San Diego.
Sanchez, who totaled six straight victories during the six-day tournament, posted a 6-7 (8), 7-5, 6-4 win over UCLA’s Yasmin Schnack in the finals. Schnack had defeated USC’s sophomore Alison Ramos in the semifinal round on Saturday.

In Monday’s long-fought final match, the No. 2-seeded Sanchez came back to win the last two sets after slipping to Schnack in a tiebreaker in the first set.
“I was really close to winning the first set, so I just needed to start the second set strong. I wanted to show her it wouldn’t be easy for her to beat me,” Sanchez said.
With the score tied 5-5 in the second set, Sanchez was able to do just that. She held her ground and broke Schnack to win the second set, providing her with enough momentum to finish off her opponent in the third set.
“It feels really good right now,” Sanchez said. “All of my matches were tough, so I was relieved to have pulled them out.”
Sanchez met some familiar faces along the way. First, she had to defeat her own teammate, freshman Danielle Lao, in the quarterfinals on Saturday.
“It’s never easy to play against a teammate because you want them to succeed just as much as you,” Lao said. “Although I’m disappointed that I lost, I wouldn’t want to go down to anyone else but my teammate.”
The next day, Sanchez faced off against UCLA’s Andrea Remynse in the semifinal round. In a close three-set match on Sunday, Sanchez won 4-6, 6-3, 6-2. Sanchez ousted Remynse last year in the ITA Regional semifinals as well.
In the preseason, Sanchez is ranked No. 17 in the nation and now holds a 6-2 overall singles record.
Sanchez also kept busy this weekend with doubles play. She is ranked No. 47 in doubles alongside her partner freshman Valeria Pulido. She and Pulido were the tournament’s No. 2 doubles seed. They had a tight match with No. 5 Ashlee Brown and Micaela Hein of Arizona State, but they came up short of a semifinal bid, losing 9-7 Friday.
“She’s definitely one of the best doubles partners in the country,” Pulido said.
Pulido said Sanchez certainly deserved to win the singles title.
“She has a great attitude all the time, especially through practices and workouts,” Pulido said.
“No one knows better than me and the other girls on the team how hard Sanchez works,” Lao added.
With this singles title in her pocket, Sanchez earned the main draw acceptance into next month’s ITA National Collegiate Indoor Championship, where she will travel to Yale University for singles play Nov. 5-8.
Sanchez played in the same national tournament last year and made it to the quarterfinal round.
“It will be a tough tournament so I’m hoping to just go out there and play well. I hope to improve on everything I have been working on,” Sanchez said.
USC assistant coach West Nott said it was an impressive week for Sanchez.
“It was nice to see her grind through so many tough matches and get some confidence under her belt,” Nott said.
Nott is confident that Sanchez has a great shot at this upcoming national tournament.
“She will build on her experience from last year, and do even better. She can definitely compete for the title,” he said.

USC scored in a variety of ways in Saturday’s 42-36 victory against Oregon State at the Coliseum, and the Pac-10 honored two players who may have been most the involved in the No. 4 Trojans’ success.
Redshirt junior running back Allen Bradford was named Pac-10 Offensive Player of the Week and redshirt junior Damian Williams was named Pac-10 Special Teams Player of the Week for their performances against the Beavers.
Conference honors · The Pac-10 took notice of running back Allen Bradford’s breakout performance Saturday, awarding the redshirt junior Player of the Week honors for his two touchdown, 147-yard outing. - Mike Lee | Daily Trojan
Bradford had a breakout game after junior running back Joe McKnight injured his hand in the first half. He took advantage of his second-half opportunities, rushing for a career-high 147 yards on 15 carries with two touchdowns.
“It made me feel good,” Bradford said. “I’ve been working hard. I’ve had a long, tough career. It’s been four years now to finally get my opportunity. I’ve got to stay humble.”
USC coach Pete Carroll was pleased with the way Bradford stepped in and seized his chance on the field after spending most of his time at USC in a rotation of running backs, behind players like McKnight, Stafon Johnson, Chauncey Washington and C.J. Gable.
“It’s been a long time for him,” Carroll said. “He’s a guy that everybody respects and loves and he’s as tough as can be. He just hasn’t really had the chance to break out, and boy he really did in a big way.”
Carroll also admitted the coaching staff probably overreacted to McKnight’s hand injury and that the No. 1 running back will be ready to start against Oregon on Saturday. Bradford, however, will still get his opportunities.
“I’m just going to get in where I fit in,” Bradford said. “I’m just going to keep doing what I’m doing.”
Williams was honored for his play on special teams for the second time this season. He returned a pair of punts for 68 yards, including a 63-yard touchdown in the fourth quarter that ended up as the game’s winning touchdown after the Beavers rallied late.
It was Williams’ second scoring punt return of the season. The other came when he returned a punt 66 yards for a touchdown in USC’s dominating victory over Cal. Williams is now one scoring punt return shy of matching USC’s single-season record set in 1952.
“He’s just so good in the open field,” Carroll said of Williams, who also had six receptions for 68 yards in the contest. “He is a legitimate threat. I don’t know how many guys have run back two punts this year, but we’re at the halfway point, and he’s just kind of getting warmed up.”
Williams, ranked fourth nationally and first in the Pac-10 in punt returns — he averages 18 yards per return — said most of his punt-return success has nothing to do with him.
“Our team is so good and has so many great athletes. If it wasn’t me, the blocking is so good [that it] could be anybody. I just happen to the lucky guy back there,” he said.
u
Senior tight end Anthony McCoy, another offensive weapon for the Trojans, went down Saturday with a sprained ankle, and Carroll is not sure if he’ll be able to play against the Ducks.
“It didn’t swell up, which is really unusual,” Carroll said of McCoy’s ankle. “So there’s some hope that maybe he’ll have some mobility, but right now I can’t tell you.”
If McCoy can’t play, redshirt sophomore Rhett Ellison will likely start in his place.
USC is also hoping to see senior fullback Stanley Havili return to action Saturday. He participated in practice Monday and is recovering from a dislocated shoulder he suffered against Notre Dame.

You know the story: You interview for the job of your dreams and walk out confident. Your interviewer Googles you, Facebooks you and generally stalks you on every website possible, and, in doing so, comes up with a few good reasons — namely, your history of naked keg stands — why you are not a “perfect fit.”
Because this not-so-urban legend has been retold by Human Resources to potential employees a number of times, most of us are under the impression that we are using our social media in the correct way.
So, are we?
Probably not. Although we may have cleared all those pictures of same-sex make-outs and red-cup sculptures, our error lies more in what we’re not paying attention to at all: LinkedIn.
If you’re like me, you’ve registered for LinkedIn (a business-oriented networking site that allows users to maintain a list of professional contacts and credentials), realized it meant you had to do “job stuff” and then returned to your trusted Facebook. It may now be time to bring that other account back from the dead, because LinkedIn is a sensation with everyone who might hire you.
We are taught that getting a job is all about networking, networking, networking. How is it that this does not immediately translate to online “social networking?” From the beginning, we should have seen that LinkedIn perfectly capitalizes on how the Internet can be a great connection tool, and how it can make our lives easier. The site sounds like a great idea — but then you actually log on, and the seemingly ad-cluttered interface immediately turns you off.
LinkedIn can improve on its web image, but it can’t improve on the way business professionals see its service. Ask anyone whose job you someday want what he or she thinks you can do to get ahead, and you’re almost guaranteed to hear, “Well, are you on LinkedIn?”
Whether you have an account or whether you don’t, today is the day to make one. Suffer through the job stuff and you’ll thank yourself later. LinkedIn is the passport to a career fair you’d otherwise never get invited to.
Of course, before you start connecting with past employers and future bosses, make sure your profile looks freaking good. Upload your up-to-date résumé, job position and photos. Browse through the groups section — find people who seem like cool dudes to you and join their conversation.
You may be surprised that the older, working demographic is so involved online. We often think that our generation is the only one technologically literate enough to take full advantage of social networking. The reason for this older generation’s infatuation with the network is the same reason we spend hours on Facebook: Once you get into the working world, your co-workers become your friends, and your job, as sad as it is, becomes your life. LinkedIn is like a Facebook for people who see life through the eyes of their profession, which will sooner or later be all of us.
Because social networking is enjoyable, it allows adults to take their work relationships up a notch. Ever notice how you thank someone in person for the nice comment she left on your status? Imagine doing this at the water cooler, and noting the strength that virtual interaction for some reason adds to your relationship. By adding another element, LinkedIn helps make the work place a whole lot more fun.
We often don’t realize how much depth online networks bring to our common social practices. I feel uniquely close to the friends I follow on Twitter, and if I see them in the real world, we talk more than we did before — usually about the network itself. Sure, it’s just small talk, but essentially, small talk is networking. Therefore, social networking is small talk, and as working men and women run out of things to say about the weather, LinkedIn brings them more to discuss.
Everyone loves to gossip, and the same goes for CEOs and secretaries. Members of LinkedIn can see what’s going on with their co-workers — who’s leaving, who’s staying, who is cousins with a famous person. If you look past the whole career part, LinkedIn is just like Facebook for the older set, playing to its different priorities. The benefits can also be explained through this metaphor: When it comes to recommending someone for a job, wouldn’t you prefer it be one of your Facebook friends than some random not even in your network?
Take the time to get your LinkedIn profile out there. It’s worth the time and getting on their level speaks volumes to employers. On the other hand, if college-oriented Facebook is still your only network, it may be time to graduate.

I appreciate the spirit of your article, but I honestly think that its dated, misleading, and fundamentally incorrect for the following reasons:
Employers don’t make hiring decisions based on how you represent yourself socially on a friend network.  In fact, most employers don’t even check references.  If a company doesn’t hire you because of how you spend your weekends, you don’t want to work there.
It’s a social network – not a recruitment network.
Authenticity trumps posturing every time.  Companies want dynamic people who can move in different social and professional settings.
My 2 cents.

In truth, Shakespeare’s Richard III needs us far more than we need it. It is a play purely for the stage, not the classroom. Without an audience with which its titular villain can manufacture an all-important connection, the play is nothing but a poetic mess of political and literal backstabbing, a crude and unsubtle pageant of bloodshed that we could no doubt do without.
If, however, we are made to like Richard III, in spite of the unconscionable enormity of his villainy, watching the play becomes worthwhile and truly dramatic.
Blood thirsty · Steve Weingartner stars in A Noise Within’s Richard III. - Photo courtesy of A Noise Within
A Noise Within’s production of Richard III, which opens its 2009-2010 season, stages the play so as to maximize that connection. Steve Weingartner’s Richard III, who begins the play as Richard, Duke of Gloucester, is made to recite his opening soliloquy from a staircase in the audience as if he were one of us — a mere observer to the glorious events unfolding onstage. We see what he sees, if only for a moment. His words are infamously chilling.
Of course, the staging stops being effective once we realize that Richard is not really an observer and certainly not one of us, but the principal actor. Evil incarnate, Richard is man who would just as soon butcher children as eat his breakfast.
The entire play rests on Richard’s deformed shoulders, for the play really only concerns one man and his bloody ascent to power. Richard, brother of the ailing King Edward IV of England (Apollo Dukakis), starts off as seventh in line to the throne, but not for long. Once Edward dies, Richard offs everyone in his way — man, woman or child — in his quest for kingship. Of course, he mostly contracts out these murders and rarely bloodies his own hands.
Weingartner’s Richard is no revelation, nor is it standard. He is far more playful than we might expect, highlighting Richard’s cavalier attitude and sardonic wit to the ninth degree. The results are mixed. On the one hand, he is better able to form some kind of connection with the audience, but on the other, he dilutes his character, to the point that connection is rendered mostly ineffectual. Weingartner is merry in his evil, but perhaps too merry, which measurably reduces his stage presence. By making his villainy into comedy, he ensures that we won’t take him seriously as truly evil, but merely as a caricatural representation thereof and someone who could never possibly exist outside the stage.
Richard risks audience alienation almost no matter what — which is not helped here by the sheer excess of his physical deformities (Richard should have a noticeable limp, but the useless arm with weirdly bandaged fingers and the hunchback and the deep scars on his face amount to overkill) — and Weingartner never quite masters the role. Regrettably, the production suffers for it, as Richard is its center. We do not connect with him as we should. In Richard, we see not the secret lust for power that inhabits some part of all our souls, but an evil clown of a villain whose death in the end is mostly a relief.
There to save the show from banality (and unfortunate comparisons to postmodern Hollywood fare) are a few valiant performances from the women, who consistently outperform their male counterparts. Their feat is made all the more impressive by the fact that some scholars — including our preeminent interpreter of Shakespeare, Harold Bloom — consider the women in Richard III unplayable. Indeed, Shakespeare was not generally kind to women in this play, making Lady Anne (a remarkable Lenne Klingaman) weak-minded and susceptible to Richard’s false charm. He woos her at the height of her misery, even though she knows he killed her husband and her father-in-law.
Susan Angelo’s widowed Queen Elizabeth deals with grief very capably and exudes regality. But it is Deborah Strang (a company mainstay) as the banished Queen Margaret who steals the show. Sometimes her part is excised to save time — Richard III is second only to Hamlet in length, and requires serious editing — but thankfully it was kept fully intact here. A witchlike prophetess of the impending doom, she hurls imprecations at a deaf royal family with delicious ease.
What doesn’t make the cut is the Duke of Clarence’s (an underutilized Bo Foxworth) dream speech, which is one of the most poetic passages from the play. Otherwise, the editing seems generally fluid, even if the references to past events in Shakespeare’s preceding histories can be confusing at times to those unfamiliar with Shakespeare’s version of English politics.
Along those lines, director Geoff Elliott was right to use the traditional setting of the play, the War of the Roses in England. Elliot’s direction in general is bold, but sometimes diminished by imprecise lighting. The fight scene at the end is fun, but never exactly thrilling, in part because Freddy Douglas is hard to buy as the valiant Richmond (his quavery intonation is better suited for more introspective characters, like last season’s Hamlet), and also because Richard’s deformities make his fighting style slightly comical.
But when the show ends, it ends; it doesn’t stay with you. Ultimately, this is only serviceable Shakespeare from a generally wonderful classical repertory company — nothing outrageous, but then, nothing revelatory. We might have hoped for outrageous.

Everyone knows what being terrified feels like.
The adrenaline rushes through your veins, your heart begins to pump violently and your sweat glands release every secretion possible — it’s an awful feeling, right?
Why then, when October rolls around, do the masses flock to theme parks and spend an evening getting truly terrified at every turn?
The insinuation that the characters in these theme park productions have the ability to kill you, but will only get close enough to make your blood curdle, is the ultimate appeal. Nothing masters that task quite like Universal Studios’ Halloween Horror Nights.
“It’s kind of like a sport,” said John Murdy, chief creative director of Halloween Horror Nights. “It’s … like the most dangerous game there is.”
Reopening three years ago after a long hiatus, Halloween Horror Nights have for the last couple of years included a variety of the public’s most feared characters — Freddy Krueger, Jason Voorhees and Leatherface. But this year, Universal has changed the game.
Inspired by a year’s worth of new horror movies, Murdy and his staff put together a brand-new crew of grotesque murderers. With four all-new mazes — “Chucky’s Funhouse,” “My Bloody Valentine: Be Mine 4 Ever,” “Halloween: The Life and Crimes of Michael Myers” and “Saw: Game Over” — fans of horror films will get a chance to walk through their favorite scenarios and become a part of the action.
“We decided that it was time for something new,” Murdy said. “We heard feedback from the fans that they were looking for a new look, and even though the fans and I love the classic horror films, it’s all about what the fans want, and since Saw is a very popular franchise right now, it’s been popular with the fans.”
The park’s first maze is  Chucky’s Funhouse maze. What is used everyday at Universal Studios as a classic horror film maze has been changed into a rundown carnival house that Chucky and his gang of possessed dolls take over to torture carnival-goers.
My Bloody Valentine reenacts the life of Harry Warden, the only survivor of a coal mining tunnel collapse who wanted revenge, and awoke on Valentine’s Day to kill. He is found popping out of crevices trying to find the people walking through his town of Harmony.
Halloween, quite possibly the most well-known horror franchise in recent years, depicts the life of Michael Myers, a troubled child who later becomes a masked killer. Guests get to walk through the house where it all began, and with every twist and turn of Michael’s old home, he is lurking and ready to take their lives.
The dread continues down to the lower lot, where Jigsaw is waiting. In the scariest maze of the event, Jigsaw makes you play a game with him, as you wander through his lair and visit all of the others who were forced to play for their lives. It’s amazing that you can make it out alive with the absolutely true-to-life scenes in that maze. Universal Studios is the birthplace of horror and is the only park that has the ability to take you through the actual sets of the most famous horror films around, but it adds one more terrifying step to this every year.
Guests begin the infamous studio tour, where they are supposed to ride a tram through Universal’s back lot, but Jigsaw has something else in mind. He drops the guests off and forces them to walk through sets like the Bates’ Motel, the destruction of the War of the Worlds set, and others, all while being accosted by the terrifying people that guests had seen through the mazes.
“Nothing like this has ever been done before where we stop the tram and allow guests to get out and wander around the back lot,” Murdy told the Los Angeles Times. “We let you walk around the real Psycho house! Where else in the world can you do that?”
With all of the sheer terror involved in the night so far, guests might be dying for a something a little less heavy.
That’s where the park’s two stage shows come into play: the Rocky Horror Picture Show: A Tribute, and Bill and Ted’s Excellent Halloween Adventure.
Bill and Ted’s has been a staple of Halloween Horror Nights since it’s resurgence, every year taking the humorous and news worthy happenings of the past year and making them come to life in a funny and provocative show filled with pyrotechnics and pizzazz. This year’s show involves a Star Trek and Cobra battle to the death, a Christian Bale freak out, a battle of the infomercial men and, of course, Lady Gaga and a bunch of dancers getting their groove on with a tribute to the late Michael Jackson.
New to this year’s event, Rocky Horror brings the cult classic to life in a larger scale, as performers depict the show on stage and provide a dancing and singing explosion that puts you right back into the film like it was the first time you’ve seen it.
If you are into the adrenaline rushing, heart pounding, sweat-pouring scare and the chance to see nearly naked dancers strutting their stuff, you’d better not miss the last few nights.

The film Stan Helsing, written and directed by Bo Zenga, prominently displays the words “A Parody” in the opening credits, which leads one to believe that the movie will, in fact, be an acceptably humorous spoof. It’s supposed to poke fun at the horror genre, which has been done repeatedly (Scary Movie 1, 2, 3, and 4, anyone?).  And so one begins watching the film with certain expectations: that the film will at least clearly reference some past horror classics and reframe it in a comedic context. This is the least a viewer could ask for in horror parody.
Living up to this meager expectation is what made Scary Movie indulgently funny, if not spectacular; after all, there always have been scenes in horror movies that were worth teasing (see: the snot-drippingly honest apology in The Blair Witch Project). However, Stan Helsing’s unforgivable flaw is that it labels itself a parody without really taking the effort to parody anything at all. Instead, the viewer is left in a haze of vague circumstances and reactions that seem familiar but not specific enough to be funny in a new context.
Bloody mess · Stan Helsing is the latest attempt at parody filmmaking. Freddy Krueger and Chucky are among the characters featured. - Photo courtesy of Anchor Bay Entertainment
Stan Helsing basically drivels for two hours by regurgitating the same horrible stereotypes and clichés that it’s supposed to be making fun of in the first place. And if that’s what a spoof should be, well, I guess I never got the memo.
The movie starts with Stan Helsing (portrayed by Steve Howey) working at a video rental store (“Schlockbusters:” really clever). This beginning scene is an omen for things to come in the rest of the movie. In the scene, Stan gets a phone call from a customer requesting advice on pornography picks, to which he responds with various “creative” titles (to highlight but a few: “Schindler’s Fist” and “Six Degrees of Penetration”); and with that auspicious start, 120 solid minutes of the same uninteresting sex jokes and stereotypes begins.
One problem is that the sex jokes, toilet humor and racial clichés are neither surprising nor interesting enough to be funny: Perhaps Zenga believes that America has not seen or heard enough of someone having a go in a bathroom stall. Black people loudly commenting on what characters do in a horror movie isn’t funny anymore; by now, it seems practically racist.
Why bother telling the same stale joke for the trillionth time? Having another one-dimensional blonde portrayed as unintelligent and promiscuous isn’t “parody” or “satire,” it’s old. To make matters even worse, the cast never becomes cohesive — comedic timing goes out the window, to say the least — and the movie suffers even more for it. The actors can’t necessarily be blamed for this; there’s really only so much you can do with such an uninspired script.
Admittedly, there is a storyline in place, but it feels like Stan Helsing is just a string of bad jokes and innuendo barely stitched together. The plot involves a series of events which leads to the protagonists being trapped inside a creepy, bizarre town, which sets up the “escape.” In of itself, such a simple plot is not a complete failure. There are other horror spoofs that generally are capable of providing easy laughs. This makes the lack of a plot somewhat of a non-issue. With Helsing, however, the plot just makes the whole thing sink faster.
Even stranger, the movie sometimes gives up on the parody concept altogether, simply taking horror villains fully out of context in vain attempts to conjure some chuckles. I won’t reveal the “climax” of the film, but it definitely can be described as perplexing (to be kind).
To be fair, spoofing anything is a difficult art. There is a thin line between parodying something and succumbing to the film’s unfortunate pitfalls. Stan Helsing doesn’t merely cross this line; it sprints a good 50 meters past it.
There is something mildly terrifying about the trend of certain types of entertainment in this post-modern era of Family Guy and movies like Stan Helsing (or Epic Movie or Dance Flick or Meet the Spartans), where cultural references somehow are necessary to form a cohesive product. Hopefully, this trend does not mark the slow extinction of true originality in culture (which is downright disturbing).
The funniest part of Stan Helsing is that a modern movie studio approved and funded such a cockeyed project. In the end, it probably would be a little too much to expect this film to be the end of mediocre parodies.
Still, you can’t help hoping.

Cobwebs and carved pumpkins take their places on front porches. Using the holiday to justify their less-than-appropriate fashion choices, girls search tirelessly for the perfect modified workers’ uniforms (this year, I hear the Foxy Firefighter will be especially big). As always, kids on sugar highs dressed as witches, goblins and ghouls will soon be running rampant in our neighborhoods. We can blame overnight sensations like Twilight for the thousands of pretend vampires that will hungrily stalk the streets seeking a taste of blood — or maybe just some candy.
As Halloween quickly approaches, we prepare for a day in which the exciting festivities provide us the once-a-year opportunity to escape from our everyday, sometimes uninspired appearances. Salacious outfits, heavy face paint or an elaborate wig will most times be all that is needed to spice up our looks, but what can be said about a disguise with a bit more celebrity appeal?
Julia Vann | Daily Trojan
In times of desperation, dressing up as your favorite musician or movie star never seems to fail. This year, Spirit Halloween, a national costume retailer that sells nearly 800 different outfits, anticipated that costumes portraying celebrities and infamous public faces would be the store’s top sellers.
To continue with the trend, people are finally retiring last year’s sexy “Sarah Palin” office wear, “Victoria Beckham” hair-styled wigs and their gold “Flavor Flav” giant clocks, and trading them in for leather jackets and sequined gloves à la Michael Jackson, latex masks in the likeness of President Barack Obama, metallic space suits courtesy of Lady Gaga and practically anything studded, leather and remotely dominatrix-looking to pass for a Rihanna getup.
With the growing ridiculousness of celebrity wardrobes today, there is hardly a shortage of ideas for one to pursue.
But as we toy over the difficult decision of what costume to wear — choosing between Elvis and a member of KISS — the process can actually be quite self-reflective. At some point, it is important to step back from the busy consumer tradition and consider the rationale behind our decisions: Why am I dressing up this way?
Just like the choice of attending parties as a Playboy bunny — or perhaps a pimp — reflects its own list of unspoken intentions, the practice of playing celebrity dress-up offers a motive of its own: the glimmering chance for us to be more like our idols. Although we emulate the rich and famous in nearly all facets of our personal lifestyles already, Halloween is more obvious and playful. While gimmicky imitation can mostly be regarded as flattering to a celebrity, some Halloween primping and prettifying is not.
Costumes can also be used to fulfill our many attitudes and grievances for celebrities, both positive and negative. For as many admirers out there just itching to bring back Madonna’s ’80s style, haters of the pop star may use a costume as yet another vehicle for mockery or dissent. For example, for years people looking to poke fun at the politician have ditched a suit and tie and paired up the best-selling mask of former President George W. Bush with their worst hillbilly attire. Ouch.
Those anticipating an uncontrollable, drunken night of misbehavior on Halloween may have gone with costumes in likeness of junkie Amy Winehouse, “crazy Britney” or what will be definitely be a popular choice this year, Lindsay Lohan.
And surely, those of us opting to be Kate Gosselin for Halloween (complete with the god-awful haircut, mom clothes and eight babies strapped to your body) are probably not the reality star’s greatest supporters either. In an opposite light, costumes can still be a colorful homage to celebrity greats. A glittery military blazer, fedora and curly wig may be the right touch to pay tribute to the recently deceased.
With all the ridicule and respect talk aside, celebrities and famous faces can rest assured that when fans, haters and everyone in between are willing to dish out the money and effort to dress like them for Halloween, perhaps they’ve gotten somewhere.

Dear Daily Trojan,
As leaders and members of the Gay Lesbian Bisexual Transgender Assembly (GLBTA), the LGBT programming branch of the Undergraduate Student Government, we are frankly offended by the editors’ opinion column in Monday’s Daily Trojan. It is extremely disrespectful to us to declare that we have not been serious about reaching out to the Greek community. To suggest that we are not “serious” and only putting in a “halfhearted effort” when addressing the topic of LGBT identities within the Greek community is an attack on the hundreds of hours that the leaders of the GLBTA have devoted to the events of October’s National Coming Out Month.
This month of events is specifically themed “Rush: GLBT” and explores the intersections between the LGBT and Greek identities. We have been planning these events since June, reaching out to Greek leaders and trying to work through the busy student schedules of members of both communities to come up with an interesting list of events. The GLBTA has spent thousands of dollars and reserved venues for more than a dozen events on this topic.
The SpeakOut that the Daily Trojan has emphasized so disproportionately, meant for the GLBT community and scheduled during the GLBTA’s regular meeting time, was only one of many events (including a TV screening, a barbecue and a trivia contest) that we have sponsored in order to create a dialogue between the two communities. We applaud the efforts of our public relations chair, Karen Marcus, and dozens of other members of our assembly for making the greater USC community aware of such events, including the Greek community. GLBTA Executive Board member Emily Allen and Panhellenic sorority member Mary Walsh even went door-to-door last Monday during the weekly dinners of half of the houses to promote the GLBTA-sponsored toga party at Ground Zero Performance Café.
After the events of last year, we are extremely pleased that Greek organizations are taking more steps to a more inclusive Greek system. We applaud Delta Delta Delta for hosting the LGBT panel that GLBTA Executive Director Genevieve Flores and LGBT Resource Center Director Vincent Vigil organized for the sorority’s members on Monday. We also encourage Greek members to attend the “How to Be An Ally in the Greek Community” event on Wednesday that we have coordinated together with the Diversity Encouragement Council of IFC and Panhellenic.
We hope the Daily Trojan will take a second look at the effort of the GLBTA in working directly with IFC and Panhellenic organizing such events.
GLBTA
