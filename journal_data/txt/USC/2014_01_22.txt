The Brittingham Family Foundation’s mission statement is to create an enlightened community by supporting education, arts, social services, youth, health and the environment. The donation comes at a time when businesses, both large and small, have seen an increased interest in graduates with a social entrepreneurship background.
The Brittingham Family Foundation has close ties to the Trojan family, as two of its board members are USC alumni. Scott Brittingham received his MBA from the Marshall School in 1988, and Ella M. Brittingham received her bachelor’s degree in English in 1992.
The Society and Business Lab will be now dubbed The Brittingham Social Enterprise Lab. The gift will help the center move one step closer toward its $15 million initiative to support growth among social entrepreneurship programs on campus.
The center will also continue to serve the USC community through programs around the world with a focus on the long-term success of its students and faculty members.
Though housed at USC Marshall, the lab works across campus in terms of curriculum offered to students. Its events and career development focus on social entrepreneurship and guest speakers who are both Trojan alumni and non-Trojan alumni.
Adlai Wertman, founding director and professor at the Society and Business Lab, expressed his optimism about the new donation.
“I am so encouraged that dedicated Trojan alumni want to support our students in having a positive impact on the world after graduation,” Wertman said. “We are looking forward to some more good news soon and we expect to be announcing a new master’s program to be offered as soon as this fall, and also a program in entrepreneurship involving K-12 education.”
The center was founded in 2008 at a time when the world was still reeling from the financial crisis and economic recession. USC quickly saw an opportunity to differentiate itself among its competitors by giving its students and faculty a leg up in the face of the changing business landscape.
The program has been very well-received by students, faculty and the provost’s office. It aims to prepare the next generation of leaders to use the tools learned at school to solve new global challenges.
The generous donation continues the established relationship between USC and the Brittingham Family Foundation.
“The gift shows that the Brittingham family continue to see USC as having the perfect nexus to support cutting-edge social entrepreneurship programs at top-notch universities while also reaching their own philanthropic goals,” Wertman said.

Longtime political campaigner and speechwriter Robert Shrum will join the USC Dornsife College of Letters, Arts and Sciences as the Carmen H. and Louis Warschaw Chair in Practical Politics.

USC Honorary Trustee Carmen Warschaw and her husband Louis created the chair with the intention of increasing and improving citizen activism. Shrum’s appointment begins June 1.
As chair, Shrum will bring his research and expertise of practical politics to the undergraduates at USC. He will be developing courses starting next fall, along with seminars and a series of programs.
Shrum, the first to hold the Warschaw Chair in Practical Politics, hopes to draw on his 40 years of experience to give a concrete view of what happens in politics.
“I think [Carmen Warschaw] wanted people to have a real sense of what it’s like inside the relationship between government and politics, and that’s what I hope to do in the courses,” Shrum said. “I hope to give people almost a sense that they were there in the middle of some of these campaigns. Then they can see what happened and what mattered, and get a feel for it as well as an analytical grasp of it.”
Shrum has spearheaded and contributed to numerous Democratic campaigns and candidates. In the 1970s, Shrum worked as a speechwriter for      then-New York City Mayor John Lindsay, as well as for George McGovern’s 1972 presidential campaign. Shrum later worked for Sen. Edward Kennedy in the 1980s as his speechwriter and press secretary.
More recently, he has served as senior adviser to Al Gore’s 2000 presidential campaign, as well as John Kerry’s in 2004.
“I was actually there,” Shrum said. “To give students a real sense of what it’s like inside, it helps to have been inside and it helps to have experienced these things. And I want to share those experiences.”
In his course, Shrum plans to focus on political campaigns — or the “great races” as he calls them — in concrete terms in order to give students a vivid picture of what they were like.
“I don’t want to do [the class] in an anecdotal, ‘great stories’ course,” he said. “What I want to do is take people to really significant campaigns and examine the sights and turning points and why they mattered and why they occurred.”
The veteran consultant also said he looks forward to arranging events with political figures that might be stopping by the USC area.
“I think one of the great advantages of L.A. is that everyone comes here one time or another. If we’re opportunistic and know when people are coming, we can conduct a public discussion.” Shrum said.
Shrum gave the examples of Joel Benenson, chief pollster and senior political strategist in Obama’s 2008 and 2012 campaigns, and Steve Schmidt, senior strategist and advisor for Sen. John McCain’s 2008 campaign, as experts who could possibly drop by.
Vice Dean of Academic Programs Steven Lamy said he believes that Shrum’s real world experience will be highly beneficial to USC students in combining theoretical learning with practical learning.
“There are lots of jobs in the field and he will help find them and explain them to students who are interested in politics as a career.” Lamy said. “He’s well positioned to introduce students to key political figures.”
USC Provost Elizabeth Garrett, who is close with Warschaw, expressed her confidence in the new appointment.
“Bob Shrum is the perfect person for the chair because of his long experience in politics at all levels and because of his experience in academic communities, helping to bring politics to life for the students in a research university.”
USC Dornsife Dean Steve Kay believes the addition of Shrum will benefit the university by putting the college on the map in terms of having a nationally recognized program of practical politics.
“[The] key thing about hiring Professor Shrum is the national visibility that he will give to our overall program of political science and especially the tract that I like to call practical politics,” Kay said. “He’s a very well-known and successful political campaigner and he’s also been a very successful member of the faculty at NYU.”
Kay also hopes to involve Shrum in future plans to create a USC semester program in Washington D.C.
As an educator of political science, Shrum said he is impressed with the younger generation’s political activity, especially in the presidential election campaigns of 2008 and 2012. He encourages students to be educated in political science and get involved in one way or another.
“My hope and my aspiration is that students decide to become active public citizens,” Shrum said. “You don’t have to run for office to have an impact, you don’t have to directly be in a campaign to have an impact, but you can care, pay attention, contribute and make a real difference.”
USC needs another left wing ideologue to indoctrinate more students because we don’t have enough already. Thanks Dornsife and USC. :(

On Feb. 2, multiple former Trojans will showcase their talents in an attempt to take home the title of Super Bowl XLVIII champions.
Seattle Seahawks cornerback Richard Sherman stole the spotlight after the NFC Championship game against the San Francisco 49ers due to his passionate post-game rant. With 22 seconds left in the game, Sherman tipped the ball away from 49ers receiver Michael Crabtree, but it was former Trojan linebacker Malcolm Smith who came up with the interception in the end zone to clinch the game and the berth to the Super Bowl.
Smith, the younger brother of former Trojan wideout Steve Smith, played at USC from 2007-2010, recording 96 tackles and one interception in his career. The Northridge, Calif. native also played on special teams during his first two years as a Trojan. Smith was drafted by the Seahawks in the seventh round of the 2011 NFL draft, going 242nd overall. This season with the Seahawks, Smith has 34 tackles and two interceptions.
Smith is joined on the Seahawks by former Trojan linebacker Mike Morgan. From 2006-2010, Morgan recorded 83 tackles. Originally from Dallas, Tex., Morgan also played on special teams at USC. Morgan went undrafted in the 2011 NFL draft, but was later signed by the Seahawks, who might have been impressed by his 4.64 40-yard-dash time. This season, Morgan contributed six total tackles for Seattle.
Seahawks tight end Anthony McCoy will also represent USC at the Super Bowl, but hasn’t played this season after being placed on injured reserve. From 2006-2009, McCoy caught 24 passes for 274 yards for the Trojans. In the 2010 NFL draft, Seattle took McCoy in the sixth round, 185th overall.
For the Broncos, offensive tackle Winston Justice will carry on the Trojan legacy. The eight-year NFL veteran played at USC from 2002-2005. He was drafted 39th overall, in the second round of the 2006 NFL draft by the Philadelphia Eagles. Justice has fought injuries all season, but is listed as probable for the Super Bowl.
Both the Broncos’ and the Seahawks’ coaching staffs also feature former Trojan greats.
Seahawks head coach Pete Carroll is known as one of the greatest USC coaches in school history. From 2000-2009, Carroll posted a .835 winning percentage as head coach. Carroll led the Trojans to two national championships, produced three Heisman Trophy winners and boasted a national-record 33 consecutive weeks as the Associated Press’ top-ranked team. ESPN ranked the Trojans of 2000-2009 the best college football team of the decade. Carroll coached in the NFL prior to his tenure with the Trojans. The University of the Pacific graduate coached the New York Jets in 1994 for one unsuccessful season before leading the New England Patriots to the playoffs in 1997 and 1998. Carroll’s Patriots teams never made it past the Divisional Round of the playoffs. With the Seahawks, Carroll has gone 38-26 and reached the playoffs three times.
The Denver Broncos’ defensive coordinator Jack Del Rio was a Trojan linebacker from 1981-1984 while also playing for USC’s baseball team. Del Rio was voted the co-MVP of the 1985 Rose Bowl, and was drafted 68th overall in the third round of the 1985 NFL Draft. The Castro Valley, Calif. native served as the interim head coach of the Broncos for four games earlier this season, when head coach John Fox was recovering from heart surgery. He also served as head coach of the Jacksonville Jaguars from 2003-2011, taking what was at the time one of the worst-performing franchises in the NFL to the playoffs twice.
Smith, Morgan, McCoy and Justice will add to the 104 previous Trojans who have appeared in Super Bowls. After this game, USC will have been represented in all but five of the 48 Super Bowls.
Nice article, but you forgot to mention the asstc oaches and support staff who are former USC asst coachesa nd support staff.

A little less than a year ago, I wrote a feature piece examining the plight of private schools — USC specifically — in college baseball. That plight is this: an NCAA Division I baseball team is allotted 11.7 scholarships to allocate amongst 27 players. If divided equally, that’s a little less than half of a scholarship per player, leaving the remaining half of tuition to be paid out of pocket. At a public school such at Cal State Fullerton or UCLA, that’s $5,500 or $16,000, respectively. At a private school, such as USC, that skyrockets to more than $22,000.
Put yourself in the position of a recruit. USC baseball coach Dan Hubbs says his program can offer you a half scholarship to play for him. Pretty sweet, right? You’re getting some $90,000 in free education over four years. But your family will also have to pay that same amount out of their own pocket. Across town, UCLA baseball coach John Savage is also offering you a half scholarship to play for him. Now all of the sudden your family will “only” be asked for around $65,000.
Or, think about it this way: your family can afford $25,000 a year for school. To play at USC you would require more than half of a scholarship. At Cal State Fullerton, that’s the entire cost of attendance out of pocket, freeing up that half scholarship for someone else.
And so the question begs: is it possible for USC to be a national power in baseball anymore? Why would the average recruit choose to pay $90,000 for college when he could pay half that?
As I approached various members of the baseball staff and the athletic department about the story — from then-head coach Frank Cruz to athletic director Pat Haden — I was met with some resistance. It would be hard for them to talk about this and not sound like they were trying to make excuses.
In fact, that’s exactly what an online commenter called the story, “Nothing but excuses.” When you’re talking about the single most successful program in the history of the sport (USC baseball’s 12 national championships are the most all-time by double over Texas’ six), it’s hard to call it anything else. Plus, there are quite a few private schools around the country (Stanford, Rice, Vanderbilt) that are constantly among the top tier of college baseball teams, something that cannot be said about USC for at least the last decade.
There are many reasons those schools have been more successful than USC, not the least of which is their respective endowments, which per student range from double to more than 10 times that of USC. And yet, their performance has slowed in recent years too.
“Of all of the sports in college athletics, statistics show that baseball is the most difficult one for private schools to be consistently competitive in on a championship level,” Haden told me for that story a year ago.
As Haden said, the numbers back that up. Rice was the last private school to win a College World Series, back in 2003. In the 10 series since then, private schools have made the CWS a total of 11 times, including just twice in the last five years. The last time more than one private school made it was 2008, when Stanford, Rice and Miami all made their way to Omaha. None have been back since.
Yet, while the performance of those schools may not be what it once was, none have experienced the headfirst plunge in both success and national relevance that USC has over the last decade. Scholarship limitations do prevent the Trojans from being the superpower they once were, but those limitations alone don’t cause the program to suffer as it has. There is absolutely no reason they should continue to.
 
Nick Burton has probably spent more time at Dedeaux Field over the last three years than he has in class. He plans to focus quite a bit on USC baseball in his column, “Any Given Saturday,” this semester. To plead with him to do otherwise, visit dailytrojan.com or email Nick at burtonn@usc.edu.
There is no crying in baseball. Former AD, Mike Garrett sold his soul hiring Kreuter to be the head coach
to satisfy his father in-law Mike Gillespie when he was fired/retired. Too many top recruits rejected a
scholarship to turn pro after high school with no real good back up plan for next level player. Also, no
national search for a proven winning head Coach by Haden once he got rid of Kreuter.

Following Thursday’s home loss to Pepperdine, USC’s first loss of the season, the Trojans recovered with a three game sweep of Long Beach State on the road, winning 24-19, 25-22 and 33-31, respectively.

Their record now stands at 4-1 overall and 3-1 in conference play.
The Trojans started the first set with five errors, giving Long Beach State a 4-0 lead. The Trojans rallied with blocks by junior outside hitters Cristian Rivera and Chris Lischke, followed by kills from Lischke, Rivera and sophomore outside hitter Alex Slaught to bring the game within two points.
The 49ers, however, met USC’s rally with blocks and kills of their own, widening the team’s lead to 14-8. The Trojans rallied again, with four kills by freshman outside hitter Lucas Yoder thanks to three sets from junior setter Micah Christenson and one from senior libero Henry Cassiday.
A kill from Rivera tied the game at 15 apiece and a block by Lischke gave the Trojans a 16-15 lead. Kills from Rivera and Slaught elevated the Trojans’ lead to 21-18. Two more blocks and a kill by Rivera set up Slaught for the game-winning kill, ending the first set in USC’s favor with a 25-19 win.
Head coach Bill Ferguson acknowledged his team’s struggles in the opening set.
“We weren’t executing our game plan as well as we could’ve,” Ferguson said. “We cleaned things up and we got it together and things went well for us.”
The second set began evenly matched, the 49ers matching each point the Trojans scored. Kills by Yoder and Christenson kept Long Beach at bay with the game tied 10-10. Each side committed attacking and setting errors, keeping the score close.
Kills from Yoder and Rivera gave the Trojans a three point lead, making the score 17-14. Kills by freshman middle blocker Andy Benesh, Yoder, Lischke and Slaught, as well as an ace from Benesh widened the Trojans’ lead, bringing the score to 23-19. After  a kill by Yoder set up game point for the Trojans. USC won 25-22 after a service error by Long Beach State ended the game.
Ferguson was proud of his team’s play in the second set.
“We continued to stay in our game plan,” the eighth-year coach said. “Our diggers and blockers did a great job of that. We were able to be agressive from the service line and limit their offense to two hitters.”
In a must-win set for the 49ers, Long Beach quickly gained a 2-0 lead, though the Trojans were quick to close the gap and eventually gain a 5-4 lead thanks to two kills by Rivera with sets from Christenson.
Errors by the Trojans kept the 49ers in the game, but kills by Rivera, Slaught and Benesh prevented Long Beach from ever gaining back its lead, keeping the score tied at eight.
Due to errors committed by USC as well as key blocks by the 49ers, Long Beach was able to surge to a 14-13 lead. Despite two kills from Benesh and one from Slaught, Long Beach was able to hold off the Trojans, maintaining a 16-14 lead.
Two kills by Yoder were undermined by his teammates’ mistakes, allowing Long Beach to keep its lead. Kills by Yoder and Rivera tied the game at 19, however, and an attack error by Long Beach gave USC a 20-19 lead.
A service error by USC allowed Long Beach to tie the critical game at 22, followed by a kill to lift the 49ers over the Trojans, 23-22. Slaught matched a kill from Long Beach, tying the game at 24, which Yoder followed with a kill of his own, giving the Trojans a 25-24 advantage.
Long Beach held off a Trojan win with kills of its own, and later tied the game at 31 apiece. Two consecutive kills by Yoder ended the third set, earning the Trojans a 33-31 victory over the 49ers.
Ferguson was excited by his team’s strong play with the third set on the line.
“We had great confidence and we remained aggressive,” he said. “Once we settled down on serving we were better. Our errors came from being aggressive.”
Yoder led the team with 19 kills, followed closely by Rivera with 17. Christenson led the Trojans in assists and digs with 46 and 17, respectively.
The pair’s play made an impact on their head coach.
“Rivera was great,” Ferguson said. “He was really effective on the right side. Once he attacked well, that allowed Lucas to hit well.”
The ability to bounce back from such a tough loss was the most significant part of the win for Ferguson.
“We rely on our volleyball IQ and our overall ability,” the coach said. “Instead of creating opportunities to score and not executing, we had digs and converted them to kills to finish the deal.”
The Trojans face Cal State Northridge on Friday at 7 p.m. in their second consecutive conference match on the road. Ferguson will make sure his team is prepared for a potential trap-game against the unranked Matadors.
“Their style is different than Long Beach,” he said. “We will enjoy victory on the bus home, but back at USC we will focus. It is a great challenge and a great opportunity for us to play two different types of game plans.”

That spark finally came for USC (10-9, 1-5) on the defensive end, as the Trojans flustered Cal’s explosive offense from the opening tip-off. And the Trojans kept up that defensive pressure until the final buzzer to pick up their first conference win of the season against the Bears (14-5, 5-1) with a 77-69 victory.
Through the first five minutes coach Andy Enfield’s squad frustrated the Bears (14-5, 5-1) and their outstanding guard Justin Cobbs.
Arguably just as important as anything happening on the court, was a certain energy that permeated throughout the Galen Center.
Golden Bear basketball fans, eager to witness a Cal victory over the Trojans in a storied rivalry that spans all sports, made their voices heard in Los Angeles Wednesday night. Deafening “Go Bears” chants were thrust onto Trojan ears during USC free throws.  The Trojan faithful responded with one of their most spirited home efforts to date, setting the scene for an energized Pac-12 clash.
Whether it was the animated crowd, the challenge of playing a talented in-state conference rival, or simply being sick of losing, USC certainly came out strong in the early goings, leading by double digits midway through the first half.
“I thought when we defended we had a lot of energy and we made some shots early in the game to give us some confidence,” Enfield said.
A three-pointer from freshman guard Julian Jacobs put the Trojans up 26-16 with eight minutes left in the first. The Bears responded with a pair of free throws, but Enfield’s squad came right back with a dunk from senior center Omar Oraby.
Oraby had a strong first half, finishing with nine points after the first 20 minutes.
“Omar really helped us in the first half,” Enfield said. “He controlled the paint at times.”
USC went into the locker room up 41-32, and there was a buzz in the Galen Center that the Trojans were finally going to pick up their first conference win.
The competitive play continued early in the second half, but the Trojans were able to withstand a quick rally from the Bears and built the lead back up to 11.
Things got a little testy a couple minutes later, with a developing skirmish between Cobbs and Oraby. The mini-fight followed a questionable no-call on Cal after an aggressive elbow from a Bear found sophomore forward Strahinja Gavrilovic’s head.
The altercation seemed to be a turning point in the game, as the Trojans quickly built a 14-point lead behind the aggressive play of Oraby, and the phenomenal passing from the backcourt.
After Cal cut the lead to 10, senior guard J.T. Terrell, who’s struggled to find his shot all season, came out of a Cal timeout and promptly hit a three to put the Trojans back up by 13.
The Bears cut it to nine, prompting an Enfield timeout with 2:29 left. USC attempted to run a set play, but when that broke down it was senior guard Pe’Shon Howard who came through with the night’s heroics.
The Los Angeles native drove through the lane and found freshman forward Nikola Jovanovic for a game-clinching dunk with less than two minutes to play.
Jovanovic, for his part, finished with a game-high (and career-high) 23 points, easily his most impressive performance to date.
The freshman received a well-deserved standing ovation as he headed to the bench for the last time, and quite a bit of praise from his head coach.
“We’re 8-1 when Nikola scores double figures,” Enfield said. “Hopefully he understands that to beat a team like Cal you need players to have big games.”
Jovanovic certainly had a big game, but he was completely focused on the team after the win.
“It’s just team effort,” Jovanovic said. “When we did everything what coach said in the locker room, we played really well.”
The win was Enfield’s first Pac-12 victory of his young career at USC.
“This league is just a bear every night,” Enfield said. “We’re fortunate to win this game but we’ve got to come back and play another team on Sunday.”
USC will try to keep the momentum going on Sunday at 2 p.m. in the Galen Center against the 12-5 Stanford Cardinal.

Passion Play, a new production at The Odyssey Theater, is structured around three different “passion play” stagings — recreations of the biblical story of Jesus Christ’s trial and crucifixion.
Each staging takes place in a new era, and provides a new world with new characters. The three leads are performers within these passion plays, and the story provides a look into their lives offstage.
The play runs for two and a half hours across three acts, each of which present a new era and new characters. The first act delves into the theater culture of medieval England, backed by the culture of Christian morality in plays at the time. The second act presents the Nazi rise to power during 1934 and the German culture immediately prior to World War II. The final act takes place in the United States in the 1980s, in a small South Dakota town, fighting against the increased secularization of the townspeople’s world.
Written by Sarah Ruhl during her time as a graduate student at Brown University, the play promises both the epic quality of a biblical narrative and the personal quality of seeing the behind-the-scenes life of actors throughout the ages. First produced in 2005, this play provides an epic look at faith’s intimate connection with theater.
The Odyssey Theater collaborated with The Evidence Room Theater to produce Passion Play.  The Evidence Room Theater is a Los Angeles-based group of actors, directors and designers who work together on various productions of their own or in collaboration with other groups and venues.
USC alum Dylan Kenin, a longtime Evidence Room actor, plays a medieval machinist, a Nazi officer, and a draft-dodger in South Dakota in this production. Despite the vast differences between his roles, Kenin believes that each serves an integral role and requires the same level of performance.
“In the diversity of characters, I’m really fleshing out the world of the play, and giving it texture, for the main characters to live their lives,” Kenin said. “I’m giving the world of the play some texture, and why [I was cast] specifically for these particular characters is that they’re pretty imposing, meant to be strong and firm in their various convictions, and that’s a thing that I’m pretty much always cast to do.”
Despite the expansive list of themes he has to work with, Kenin sees his roles as a way for the audience to grasp the story both on a simpler, person-to-person level and on a larger scale.
“I’m also one of the observers of the action, somebody that’s there that the audience wants to identify with, to be kind of meta about it,” Kenin said. “I think that as an audience member, people will be swept up in the minutia of what the lead characters are going through. What just came into my mind was Jean Valjean from Les Misérables. There’s a sweeping epic, but you kind of get caught up in the largeness of the revolution. It’s easy to not feel that personally connected to it. I feel like the largeness of this play never overshadows any given moment with how characters deal with the world they live in.”
According to director Bart DeLorenzo, the production benefits both from his casting decisions and his previous work with Ruhl. DeLorenzo previously directed Ruhl’s other play, Dead Man’s Cell Phone. He founded the Evidence Room theater company in 1995 and has been building and grooming a group of actors ever since.
“I think that Sarah Ruhl is one of those innovative writers who is writing for the future,” DeLorenzo said. “[She] started her career as a poet, and that doesn’t mean that it is written in poetic dialogue, but the way that a poem rhymes, that feeling of exuberance when you read a poem — that’s what this theater piece feels like. I think it very unusually meshes with the theater.”
But for DeLorenzo, the secret weapon of this production is The Odyssey’s theater space.
“It’s a great space,” DeLorenzo said. “It’s a very large room where this play is performed, and the dimensions are nice for this play. It feels a little bit like a church. I think that the playwright is playing with the idea that the theater itself is like a church, and the space looks a little bit like a church. So it’s a really great location for this play.”
 
Passion Play, put on through the Evidence Room theater company at the Odyssey Theater, opens on Jan. 25 and runs until March 16.

On the heel of the Academy Award nominations last week, there has been plenty of analysis over who got just recognition and who got snubbed. There will always be performances that are overlooked by the Academy (and the seemingly endless string of yearly awards that precede the Oscars). This year, one in particular is not only getting overlooked, but is also being explicitly disqualified by some award events. Scarlett Johansson’s performance in Spike Jonze’s Her was disqualified from contention in the Golden Globe Awards because she played the voice of an artificial intelligence and thus never had a moment on-screen. She also failed to get an Oscar nod. The conventional thought is that her lack of time in front of a camera made her a complete longshot in the race for a nomination, let alone the award itself. These complaints are absurd, as Johansson put on a wonderful performance, easily good enough for a nomination — and just maybe for the award itself.
The discussion about Johansson’s eligibility is reminiscent of the 12-year-old debate over Andy Serkis’ eligibility for an award for his motion capture performance as Gollum in The Lord of The Rings: The Two Towers. He gave a captivating performance, but since he never actually appeared on screen, similar criticisms of his candidacy emerged. If one looks deeper into the comparison of both roles, however, many important differences emerge. First and foremost, despite never actually appearing in the film, Serkis still did all of his work in front of the camera. His performance was a physical one as much as it was vocal. Johansson’s job was an entirely different animal. Where Serkis acted in front of the cameras and was later heavily modified with computer effects, Johansson never spent a day on the set. She came in after filming had been completed and was asked to perform in a sound booth, similar to any other voice-over actor in an animated movie.
And unlike the voice actors in Frozen, Johansson didn’t even have an on-screen character upon which to reference her performance. All she had was the equally impressive performance of Joaquin Phoenix to play off of to create chemistry. She was essentially tasked with creating chemistry with a recorded video. Johansson deserves quite a bit of praise for not only finding a way to do this effectively, but also movingly. Her lack of interaction with the camera should boost her candidacy rather than hinder it. Where other actresses in strong consideration for the supporting actress award such as Jennifer Lawrence for American Hustle and Lupita Nyong’o for 12 Years a Slave excelled in doing what they have been practicing for as actresses, Johansson excelled while venturing out into very uncomfortable and uncharted territory for an actress.
It is, by all ways of looking at it, a very unique role. There have been other voiced interfaces in film, most famous Hal in 2001: A Space Odyssey, but Hal, if anything, is famous for his cold robotic bedside manner in dealing with the humans on his space station. In Her, Johansson’s character Samantha is a polar opposite to Hal. She’s friendly, funny and even sexy — something that Hal never quite managed to achieve. Some critics described the sensual scenes in the film as being akin to phone sex, as Samantha’s lack of a body limits the possibilities of anything else, and thus being irredeemable. These are probably the same critics who occupy the camp that argues against Johansson’s candidacy, they seem to be missing the forest for the trees. The film acknowledges very well that a relationship missing any physical interaction would be extremely difficult, but it also shows that chemistry and even sensuality are possible. Phoenix and Johansson build up a painting of an evolving, tragic relationship, despite the constraints of their roles.
At the Rome Film Festival back in November, Johansson was not only nominated as a leading actress, but won the entire festival’s Best Actress Award for Her. Stateside, the actress had been submitted as a supporting actress candidate and this, in an ideal situation, should have allowed her even more leeway when it came to the selection process. The Academy’s supporting category is notoriously permissive in comparison to others. Beatrice Straight managed to win the award in 1976 for Network despite under six minutes of screentime, and Hermione Baddeley snagged a nomination in 1959 for her performance in Room at the Top with only two minutes and some change onscreen. It would be extremely difficult to argue that a two and a half minute performance could be more impactful to a film than Johansson’s role (even though Johansson would have technically surpassed Baddeley for the new screentime record). Here’s hoping that the Academy failed to nominate Johansson for an award solely based on the merits of her performance rather than her lack of screentime.

In the middle of Beverly Boulevard now sits a shop with a calm and welcoming atmosphere. The door to Sweet Rose Creamery opens into a symphony of smells, coming from both the ice cream freezer and the sweets case.
True test · Sweet Rose Creamery proves its worth with a scoop of its mouthwatering vanilla ice cream nestled in a handmade chocolate cone. The newest Creamery is now open on Beverly Boulevard. – Danny Razzano | Daily Trojan
Sweet Rose Creamery got its start when the husband and wife duo of Josh Loeb and Zoe Nathan decided that the L.A. area lacked restaurants that are both delicious and down-to-earth.
As a result, Loeb and Nathan set out a few years ago to open restaurants with a commitment to high-quality local ingredients, talented and kind employees and hand-made dishes. They are now the owners of Rustic Canyon Wine Bar and Seasonal Kitchen, their farm-to-kitchen, dinner-only restaurant; Huckleberry Cafe & Bakery, a coffee and pastry shop; Milo & Olive, which features a bakery-driven breakfast and small-plate lunch, and Sweet Rose Creamery.
SRC pasteurizes on site and begins every ice cream and sorbet recipe from scratch — and it shows. The ice cream is of the highest quality in taste and in texture. Both the ice cream — with and without dairy — and the sorbet have a perfectly creamy texture and manage to melt slowly without dripping down the cone.
Even the sorbets, which are often tricky for eateries to master, have a creamy texture.  The pomegranate sorbet proffers the perfect tang with just a touch of sweetness.  This coupled with a creamy texture that isn’t normally found in sorbets makes the first bite a pleasant surprise.
Ice cream stores often try relentlessly to create unique flavors, usually to no avail; but SRC manages to create spot-on recipes for flavors such as toasted almond, ginger and pomegranate. The distinctive flavors help SRC to stand out in a crowd, but its versions of ice cream staples are what make it an outstanding shop.
The banana ice cream tastes exactly like freshly baked banana bread — just a little colder. The salted caramel is also a perfectly creamy blend of sea salt and rich caramel and, when served with a sprinkle of coarse sea salt on top, is a delectable treat for those looking for something less sweet. Together, though, the banana and salted caramel create the perfect Bananas Foster-esque delicacy.
The truest test of an ice cream store, though, is their vanilla. And SRC nails it. They steep the perfect amount of vanilla into a thick, creamy base to create a vanilla that exceeds expectations. In a fresh, homemade chocolate waffle cone, the SRC vanilla is nearly unbeatable.
The waffle cone, a welcome change from the traditional cone, is a delectable addition to SRC’s ice cream.  The perfect crunch on the ouside complements a softer inside, which, together, create the perfect bed for any of SRC’s flavors.  The cones, which come in chocolate and original flavors, are handmade every day by the staff at SRC.
The stores feature at least 12 flavors each day, which consist of ice creams, sorbets and dairy-free ice creams. The ice cream freezer holds a wicker shelf with elegant stainless steel bowls for each flavor, making them all the more appealing to sweet-toothed patrons.
Along with their ice cream, their sweets case contains hand-made, made-from-scratch cones and toppings, frozen treats, pies and cakes and patrons can order fruit pops, coffee, sundaes, milk shakes and ice cream cakes or pies, along with fresh pastries made at the Milo & Olive bakery.
The flavors offered rotate every month and the menu changes to place emphasis on what’s in season to continue their commitment to freshness. When they opened SRC, Loeb and Nathan hired Shiho Yoshikawa as the chef and co-owner of SRC. Every week, Yoshikawa shops at the Santa Monica Farmers’ Market for organic and locally grown fresh fruits and herbs to make the SRC products.
The friendly atmosphere of the shop only makes customers more likely to return for more ice cream. Loeb and Nathan make a point to hire friendly, approachable staff and it shows.  Customers feel comfortable and welcome throughout  their visits. The staff on Beverly Boulevard offers samples galore and topping suggestions based on their favorite combinations.
The only drawback at the SRC is the spoons. The bowls of the spoons used at SRC are too deep, which leads to residual ice cream left in the bottom after each bite.
Loeb and Nathan opened the original SRC location at the Brentwood Country Mart and, after the glowing response it received, opened a second location on Pico Boulevard. Yesterday marked the opening of their third location at Beverly Boulevard.
This post has been updated to reflect the Mid-City, not Downtown, location of the new Sweet Rose Creamery shop as previously reported.

More than 40,000 people — casual moviegoers and film industry professionals alike — flocked to the quaint resort town of Park City, Utah for the year’s largest and most internationally renowned showcase of independent cinema — the Sundance Film Festival. Now in its celebratory thirtieth year, Sundance has consistently served as a welcome beacon for domestic and international shorts, features and documentaries at a time when studio dominance and corporate, profit-driven filmmaking continues to grow.
Man behind the sun · Robert Redford, founder and president of Sundance, the world’s premiere film festival, spoke at seminars at the festival in Park City, Utah this week. USC cinema students had the opportunity to see the festival’s innerworkings and network with other festival attendees. – Photo courtesy of Sundance Film Festival
A group of USC students found themselves among the attendees, many through a trip organized by Delta Kappa Alpha (DKA), USC’s co-ed professional cinema fraternity.
For some, this was an opportunity to volunteer at the festival, while others used it as an opportunity to hone their ever-important networking skills.
But when so many opportunities abound for rubbing shoulders, it’s often impossible to grasp them all with equal vigor.
“You can easily feel disappointed in yourself,” said Keely Weiss, a senior majoring in writing for screen and television.
Still, Sundance undoubtedly acts as something of a democratizing force for attendees.
Audience members and celebrities alike are bundled up in brightly colored ski jackets to brace themselves against the bitter cold. Prominent distribution executives and agents strike up conversations with volunteers and locals whilst waiting in extensive lines and film recommendations are traded back and forth like candy among strangers united by their love for cinema.
This 10-day bubble of constant film-watching generates an atmosphere alive and buzzing with both business and pleasure as sales are made, talent discovered and films revered in a premonition of some of the theatrical releases that will, with some luck, pepper 2014’s filmic landscape.
“Sundance is a marketing haven,” said screenwriter/producer Marquis Smalls, who attended Sundance for his sixth year this week as part of the entourage representing the feature Dear White People.“ There aren’t many festivals that draw together so many people from the industry in one place; it’s all very condensed.”
Sundance is fundamental for both emerging and established filmmakers looking to attain distribution for their films. As one of the most highly-regarded and attended festivals on the international film circuit, Sundance attracts many up-and-coming independent films, the producers of which bank on breaking through at the festival in order to court wider audiences.
“Sundance is a market,” Weiss said.
Films like the opening night selection Whiplash (inspired by director Damien Chazelle’s short, which premiered at Sundance last year) are indicative of Sundance’s notorious characteristics.
Whiplash is a coming-of-age story starring Miles Teller. Last January, J.K. Simmons sold its international distribution rights to Sony Pictures Classics the very same night it premiered to an extremely receptive Sundance audience.
Unfortunately, many of the films screened at the festival are hard-pressed to obtain similar deals. In 2013, only 75 features obtained distribution deals out of the 119 screened, and many deals were made on limited terms, according to Cultural Weekly.
Though for the majority of the 40,000 visitors, including and especially the many students, the goal is simply the sheer pleasure of escaping class or work to indulge in the newest and most daring independent films.
This year’s most highly regarded films include I Origins, a bold narrative exploration of science fiction and spirituality, Boyhood, Richard Linklater’s cumulative coming of age tale that has been 12 years in the making, and Wish I Was Here, Zach Braff’s kickstarter-funded quirky dramedy.
Festival attendees can purchase individual tickets for $20 each, or splurge on a pass (starting at $1,500) to ensure access. Arabella Weston-Smith, a junior majoring in critical studies, took her chances and chose to scalp tickets and experiment with Sundance’s new smart phone wait-listing app instead.
“I’d advise people to really be on top of it if they choose to do that,” Weston-Smith said. “But luckily I was able to see nine films in five days without paying for a pass.”
The wait-listing app has inevitable kinks as lists of up to 200 ticketless patrons are filled up in a matter of seconds. The system has replaced the wait-listing method of previous years, which saw audiences without tickets lining up outside theaters as early as six hours before popular premieres.
“I wish I had planned a little better and read the program more thoroughly,” Weiss said. She admitted that the combination of an extensive selection and limited ticket purchasing for pass-holders led her to make some snap decisions.
Overall, the Sundance Film Festival offers a unique experience for students interested in the entertainment industry and looking to expand their knowledge of independent film, whether through networking opportunities or innovative screenings.

Despite the recent discovery that New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie’s staff intentionally caused traffic problems as a form of political revenge, the potential presidential candidate’s approval ratings went largely unchanged, according to the Huffington Post.
Wendy Fu | Daily Trojan
In fact, Gov. Christie’s approval rating only dropped by eight points amid the “Bridgegate” scandal, settling at approximately 55 percent. The polls show that this drop in popularity came from mostly democrats, with republicans remaining firmly in his corner.
Regardless of polling, Gov. Christie needs to close the book on this saga and provide answers to the public’s satisfaction.
Gov. Christie has a long history of being a “straight-talker.” He has long represented himself as a man who doesn’t trifle when it comes to his language or methods. When asked during the government shutdown what he would do if he were a senator at the time, Gov. Christie responded, “If I was in the Senate right now, I’d kill myself,” according to the Philadelphia Inquirer. That forthright persona has long lent Gov. Christie a air of trustworthiness, a sense that he is a man who does indeed rise up when the bell tolls. He comes across as the rare politician more concerned with the people who elected him last time rather than the hypothetical people who might elect him next time.
The problem with Gov. Christie’s long history of being a straight-talker, however, is that most of the narrative was built by him in the first place. It’s that old adage about how the truly talented don’t need to say how talented they are or the humble don’t need to walk around pointing out how humble they are. If Gov. Christie is so trustworthy, so unable to mince his words, why does he feel the need to constantly remind people how trustworthy he is?
Thus, the public is left with many different narratives — a media that is saying the story isn’t over so we’ll keep watching their stations, a democratic party that alleges Gov. Christie knew about the bridge closure and Gov. Christie himself insisting that the decision was made without his knowledge. Yet unfortunately for Gov. Christie, it doesn’t really matter. Regardless of the answer, we’ve learned something about the governor, something that he can’t talk the public into unlearning.
If Gov. Christie did know about the bridge closing, there’s likely no coming back. If a governor who spends all his time talking about how he refuses to play politics is discovered to have played politics in a way that directly, and very negatively, impacted his citizens, he’ll lose all credibility going forward. It’s the kind of behavior that would be genuinely funny on the Sopranos — the kind of thing an audience would laugh about for its creativity in putting down someone who didn’t support you. The problem is that this isn’t a premium cable drama series. It’s hurting real people in a real way, even more so for those unlucky few whose emergency medical needs went unmet because of traffic. If Gov. Christie had a direct hand in that decision, he won’t just get criticism from the Democrats — he’ll get it from his own party.
In fact, the situation reflects negatively on Gov. Christie even if he didn’t know what his staffer was doing. Much of what people have criticized President Barack Obama for over the past five years is a perceived lack of control over his staff. With the president currently struggling to gain footing in his second term, no one is going to race to the polls to vote in another leader who can’t control his own employees.
Politics has to run like a ship — everything has to go through the captain or you get crew members doing conflicting things because they have conflicting ideas of how to best reach their next port. The fact of the matter is the crew hired to steer the ship. Politics is much the same. The public didn’t elect Gov. Christie’s staffers, nor President Obama’s for that matter, and we as a people haven’t given them the power to make final decisions. By and large, the people of New Jersey probably agree on what they want for their state, but the only man they have allowed to get them there from the captain’s seat is the Governor — not anyone he chooses to appoint.
Overall, no side of this looks good for the governor. Either he’s the captain purposefully steering his ship the wrong way to spite a crewmember refusing to fall in line, or the captain asleep at the wheel with a crew run amok. No matter what, Bridgegate looks like it could be a rocky ending for Gov. Christie.

You’re leaning over backward to give Christie the “benefit of the doubt”. But that’s ridiculous. It’s absurd to suppose that this big bully and control freak didn’t know exactly what his people were doing.
Calum I am going to change your last paragraph a little. It is not shocking to see your bias as you write but it is sad . Why don’t you have some journalistic integrity and do a story on something that really matters.
“Overall, no side of this looks good for the POTUS . Either he’s the captain purposefully steering his ship the wrong way to spite a crewmember refusing to fall in line, or the captain asleep at the wheel with a crew run amok. No matter what, AFFORDABLE CARE ACT WEBSITE, IRS SCANDAL, NSA SCANDAL, BENGHAZI, FAST AND FURIOUS looks like it could be a rocky ending for PRESIDENT OBAMA.”
According to “Janae”, its “bias” if any journalist dares to challenge or criticize a Republican
In fact, he can’t defend christie’s behavior, so he tries to change the subject by dragging in all kind of irrelevance about (many of them fictional) about the President.

It’s hard to write a weekly column on a Congress that turns three-day weekends into weeklong recesses. That’s right — Congress has adjourned until Jan. 27. After Congress passed a $1.1 trillion spending bill that keeps the government’s lights on until September, it’s worth considering an idea that requires no government spending and was proposed in President Barack Obama’s State of the Union address last year: a raise in the federal minimum wage.
An increasing number of economists support a raise in the minimum wage, debunking the long-held myth that it would be a “job killer.”
Predictably, business backers of politicians overwhelmingly oppose the measure. All four candidates for governor in Illinois, for example, oppose raising the state’s minimum wage. Yet raising the minimum wage has polled favorably nationally among 64 percent of Independent voters and 57 percent of Republican voters in a CBS News poll conducted last November.
Since the 1960s, the increases in the minimum wage have lagged behind inflation, causing the purchasing power of a minimum wage salary to be even less than it was then. In other words, an employee in 1965 making the federal minimum wage of $1.50 an hour would have been able to buy more goods at 1965 prices than someone living on the minimum wage today.
A bill in the Senate proposed by Tom Harkin (D-IA) would correct both problems by bumping the minimum wage to $10.10 to correct for the historical lag and mandate that it rise in tandem with inflation, preventing such a lag from happening again.
The federal minimum wage, effective since 2009, stands at $7.25 an hour. The last federal law that reformed the minimum wage was passed in 2007. According to the National Conference of State Legislatures, 21 states have minimum wages that exceed the federal minimum wage (and 10 of those tie its increase to inflation). The rest of the states either don’t have one (and defer to the federal minimum), copy the federal minimum or have minimum wages below the federal level (causing the federal minimum to apply).
Is there something wrong with this picture?
The old-school economic curriculum holds that raising the minimum wage is a recipe for higher unemployment. This is because when a good (a job, in this case) is in demand (people are looking for jobs), raising the price floor (the minimum wage) of providing that good to the supplier (the employer) will create a shortage (higher unemployment) because the good is now more expensive to produce. In other words, if doing each math problem on tonight’s homework suddenly took twice as long (cost more to supply), a given student might decide to supply less math problem answers to the professor in the next day’s class.
I’m not an economist. If you’re looking for the economic case for raising the minimum wage, type “Paul Krugman minimum wage” into Google and read until your economic heart is content. If you don’t believe Krugman, move to San Francisco. The city raised its minimum wage above the federal level in 2004, and in seven years its employment rate had increased at a higher rate than any other county in the Bay Area.
But I don’t want to live in a society that solves social problems with an economics textbook. If I did, I would move to Pyongyang, North Korea. Isn’t there a moral case for raising the minimum wage?
A report out from Oxfam, a global organization dedicated to fighting poverty, reveals that the world’s 85 richest people are as wealthy as the bottom half of the world’s population combined — some 3.5 billion people. That should be enough to support any policy that tries to put more money in the pockets of those who are far too often exploited by the top 85.
President Obama gives his annual State of the Union address next Tuesday. Contrary to the beliefs of some, we shouldn’t measure prosperity by the state of the strong, the “job creators,” or the “investors,” but rather by the state of the millions of people that get up every morning to work an 8-hour day and come home every night to car payments, electrical bills and grocery receipts. The state of the union is measured by the state of those people, and President Obama should remind Americans of that Tuesday night.

I concur with what Rich K wrote.  Nathaniel is a sophomore majoring in poli sci and economics.  It appears he has yet to take his first econ class.  The poll indicating that the public favors an increase in the minimum wage does not mean it is good policy nor good economics.  The “public” has no dog in the fight so  they can easily say they are for it; I could say I am for it, except for possible higher retail prices. I am not the one to have to pay workers the higher minimum wage.   If you were to poll owners of small businesses such gas stations, donut shops, restaurants, etc., you might get different results.  Thus, the poll results add nothing to justify increasing the minimum wage.  Nathaniel brings up the case of SF with the high minimum wage and its increase in employment hiring in the city over the past 7 years.  There is no nexus between the two.  He should know full well that the employment increase in SF is a result of the tech boom in that city and all these new hires are clearly not minimum wage.  Like Nathaniel, I am no economist, but I try to think and argue logically rather than pander to emotion or morality.
My suggestion to Nathaniel is to take some econ classes and learn about the consequences of increasing the minimum wage. Typical academia makes snap judgments without understanding the ramifications.
He’s double majoring in poli-sci and econ. But alas it doesn’t seem he know what he’s talking about wrt minimum wage.
First, I’m glad to hear from Rich Kotite, the greatest head coach in the history of the 1994 Eagles. Good to know that mesh hats are still in vogue.
Second, Coach Kotite, it is not an argument against this article to tell its author to go read the very textbooks in the same classes that he confronts in the article. That’s like writing a negative review of “Super Size Me!” telling Morgan Spurlock to eat a Big Mac.  As Nathaniel has said, go read Krugman. See? See how easy that is?
Third, Nathaniel has supplied us with the logic of the conventional wisdom (which treats a job as a commodity, rather than an economic growth opportunity) and devastates it with evidence that the conventional model didn’t apply to San Francisco.  Reality beats theory like rock beats scissors.
Fourth, do you like or dislike academia? Because textbooks are the product of academia. I was unaware that it was the practice of academia to disregard the textbooks they produce, apparentky through “snap judgments.”
Fifth, I’m sure Nathaniel has taken econ classes. If you read his bio, he’s an econ major.

In this world of convergence, the line between journalist and blogger is continually distorted. On Jan. 17, a federal appeals court made the line even more obscure when it ruled that bloggers are afforded the same protections as journalists in cases of defamation, according to Politico.
Christina Ellis | Daily Trojan
The case involved Oregon-based blogger Crystal Cox, who was initially denied First Amendment protection after being sued by Obsidian Finance Group for accusing the company of tax fraud on her blog — a claim later proven to be false. Because the courts determined Cox was not a journalist, she was not afforded shelter behind the First Amendment in defamation cases. As a result, a jury awarded Obsidian $2.5 million in damages.
That was in 2011. Today, the courts stand behind the idea that journalists do not have to be associated with institutional media groups, such as The New York Times or Washington Post.
This decision is not the first ruled in favor of the journalist. In early 2013, a New Jersey court ruled that bloggers qualify for protection under the state’s shield law, according to the Business Law News.
Yet with these recent decisions, the high courts have ushered in the new era of media rights, after years of relying on outdated rules to bring sense to modern cases. The Internet and social media sites such as Twitter and Facebook have revolutionized the work journalists do and mediums through which they do them.
Some argue that providing shield law protection to non-affiliated journalists will dilute and corrupt the institution of journalism. Though it is true that there must be standards for journalists, as there are standards for professionals in any trade, excluding shield laws from bloggers is not the solution. The industry should be excited to include them.
The impact of bloggers has already been felt and surely will continue to grow as the daily presence of the Internet does. Bloggers have helped breathe life back into the industry while simultaneously revolutionizing and recreating it with their multimedia skills. Barring them from the same protection afforded to journalists at legacy institutions will only stifle the industry.
Judge Andrew Hurwitz, who ruled in favor of Cox, wrote that distinctions no longer matter. Hurwitz wrote, “The protections of the First Amendment do not turn on whether the defendant was a trained journalist, formally affiliated with traditional news entities … As the Supreme Court has accurately warned, a First Amendment distinction between the institutional press and other speakers is unworkable.”
The change in journalism is occurring, and bloggers are now legally along for the ride too. When shield laws were originally enacted in the 1970s to protect journalists from legal retributions for doing their job, there was no Gawker or YouTube. Yet because they are now an ever-present element of society, we cannot ignore their influence on the industry.
The Internet has expanded the role of the journalist and, proportionally, the laws protecting journalists should grow. With social media essentially available to anyone with a smartphone and Wi-Fi today, tradition has — at times reluctantly — bowed to the trends. As so too should the journalism industry when it comes to definitions of “journalist.” If the blogger is willing to follow the same rules of the game as a journalist, then there is no reason not to widen the playing field. Journalists are never afraid of the additional competition, right?

USC’s men’s tennis team began the season with a strong showing at the Sherwood Collegiate Cup this past weekend in Thousand Oaks, Calif.
Three of the eight Trojans at the weekend’s tournament — freshmen Connor Farren, Nick Crystal and Rob Bellamy — were competing in their first spring competitions at USC.
Farren made an impressive debut, advancing to the quarterfinals in singles and making a run to the semifinals alongside junior Roberto Quiroz in doubles play. Farren won his first match as a Trojan with a 6-3, 7-6 victory against USD’s Filip Vittek, then beat Stanford’s John Morrissey by a 4-6, 7-5, 6-4 score in the Round of 16. In the quarterfinals, Farren fell short against UCLA’s Clay Thompson, the No. 1 player in the country, by a score of 6-4, 4-6, 6-4.
Quiroz also advanced to the quarterfinal round in singles. After defeating players from Baylor and UCLA in the first two rounds, Quiroz fell the eventual singles champion, UCLA’s Marcos Giron, 6-2, 7-5.
In doubles, Farren and Quiroz reached the semifinals after taking down pairs from Stanford and UCLA. In the quarterfinals, they faced USD duo Vittek and Clarke Spinosa, falling 8-6.
Though sophomore Max de Vroome came up empty in the first round of singles play against UCLA, he bounced back with three consecutive wins in the consolation tournament, upsetting Baylor’s Tony Lupieri by a score of 6-4, 7-6.
Stanford players John Morrissey and Maciek Romanowicz won the Sherwood Cup doubles title this weekend, while UCLA’s Giron brought a victory for the Bruins in the singles tournament.
