The USC College Republicans hosted Breitbart.com’s Adelle Nazarian Wednesday in the Mark Taper Hall of Humanities for a discussion on the nuclear agreement the Obama administration brokered with Iran.
Jacob Ellenhorn, president of the College Republicans, helped to secure Nazarian as the guest speaker for the night’s Iran deal discussion.
“Adelle has been covering the Iran deal in depth on Breitbart.com for quite a while, and she is someone who is accessible,” he said.  “We have a lot of people in common, and I have run into her at a bunch of events.”
Nazarian is a first-generation Iranian-American and was born and raised in Livingston, New Jersey. She currently resides in Los Angeles where she works as a journalist specializing in politics and national security, specifically focusing on China and Iran.
To begin the discussion, Nazarian addressed the Iran deal’s controversial nature. Though she acknowledged the deal’s Democratic origins, she said discussions about it have crossed party lines.
“Both parties have actually found positives and negatives of the deal,” she said. “The way I see it, if it was a Republican-backed deal I have a feeling Democrats would have a lot of opposition to it as well.”
Nazarian explained the details of the Iran Deal to the club, addressing both Republican and Democratic opinion. She then took questions from the audience. Nazarian’s hesitance toward the deal was evident in her responses.
“What should have happened, in my opinion, after speaking to a lot of senators and congressional representatives, is that there should have been a more detailed deal negotiated because there were too many concessions made to Iran,” she said.
Nazarian said she advocates taking a stronger approach toward Iran. However, she does not feel that war has to be the solution. In fact, despite her reservations, she does see some positive aspects of the agreement.
“The only positive of this deal is that for a little bit of time, maybe for a few years, the Iranian people will have gotten back to zero again and will possibly get a little bit of money,” she said.
As a woman of Iranian descent, Nazarian has unique insight into life in the country. She said that based on her experience, the true threat to American security is the regime and believes that the Iranian people would benefit from revolution. She emphasized that the Iranian nation cannot be stereotyped based on the regime alone.
“The Iranian regime is a very different entity than the population,” Nazarian said. “The people of Iran are actually pro-West and pro-Western democracy. They love America, generally speaking, and they are very much against the regime.”
Though not in support of the deal, Nazarian said the future of U.S.-Iranian relations is difficult to anticipate.
“Right now, we are at a point where we’re living for today. Tomorrow will be determined by unpredictable actions on the world stage. So, we’ll see what happens next,” Nazarian said.

Stacks on stacks · USC Libraries has aquired an archive of 250,000 photos from architectural photographer Wayne Thom. Faculty is working with Thom to create an exhibit of the collection on campus. – Mariya Dondonyan | Daily Trojan
USC Libraries has recently acquired a 250,000 image archive of photos from architectural photographer Wayne Thom.
According to Hugh McHarg, associate dean of the USC Libraries,  thought Thom’s collection fit in well with the works they had already collected.
“It started because an architecture professor named Jim Steel knew Mr. Thom and of his importance in the world of architectural photography,” McHarg said. “And he thought that the collection would really supplement what we have already in terms of L.A. history, the history of photography, architecture collections and he thought that USC would make a great home for it.”
The collection is currently being transported. When asked about the future of Thom’s work, McHarg said that they are working toward an exhibition of the work around USC.
“There’s an exhibition coming up in November in Hollywood,” he said. “And we’re also working with [Thom] to develop our own exhibition probably sometime in 2016 after all of the images get here and we can talk to Wayne about how he may want to shape an exhibition.”
McHarg said what was particularly alluring about Thom’s collection was how it covered the duration of his career.
“[His photos] span about five decades, so within that collection you have the history of the architecture, the history of the photography, you have the style of the imminent photographer’s way of approaching the buildings as sculpture,” he said. “The other interesting thing about [Thom] is that part of the collection is his graphic design work from the ’70s and ’80s. He would also work with architects on their pitched presentations to build other structures. So he was really involved with image making and corporate branding long before any of us were thinking in those terms.”
“I think it’s great that USC is getting this collection from a renowned architectural photographer,” said Donald Annarella, a junior majoring in policy, planning and development. “I think it just enhances our understanding of contemporary and historic architecture.”
The collection also includes documents from Thom’s professional life as a corporate marketer. McHarg said that this allows them to look at multiple different angles when preparing their exposition of his work.
“Part of the collection is his work diaries,” he said. “We have notes from his presentations to corporate clients, he would design logotypes for their business cards, he would do their brochure design. So while it’s wonderful as a creative and artistic resource, it’s also a business resource. It’s the history of corporate image making. So there’s lots of angles for to this. When we begin to develop an exhibition we’ll be trying to do all of those things so it’s coming from as many disciplinary angles as possible.”
Annarella said the collection will act as artistic inspiration for others.
“One of the famous quotes is, ‘There’s nothing new under the sun,’” Annarella said. “So I think there’s all sorts of historical precedents for things that we think are new trends, and we now have some great historical precedents that we can look to for inspirations and ideas, and see that maybe it has been done before.”

Dan Schnur, director of the Jesse M. Unruh Institute of Politics, discussed the heavily debated Iran nuclear deal Wednesday night at USC Hillel during the first of two Trojan Leadership Dinners hosted by Trojans for Israel.
“We host the dinner in order to unite student leaders in a networking opportunity and as an educational way to learn about the U.S.-Israel relationship,” TFI President Samantha Viterbi said in an email. “We chose this topic  because we believe this is the most important policy issue of our time.”
The Obama administration has been negotiating a deal with the Iranian government for the past 20 months and after the deal was reached in early July, a 60-day review period commenced in Congress, where it was met with criticism. By Sept. 17, Congress must vote to either accept or reject the deal.
“Trojans for Israel is a bipartisan, undergraduate student organization that advocates on the vitality of the U.S.-Israel relationship,” Viterbi said. “We create leadership statements every semester, on pressing topics relevant to our local members of congress, and ask student leaders to sign onto them.”
Hillel held the event at their off campus location. According to its website, Hillel’s mission is, “To enrich the lives of Jewish undergraduate and graduate students so that they may enrich the Jewish people and the world.”
Student leaders and TFI members alike were in attendance at the event.
Tamar Fleshler, vice president of religious life for Hillel, also hoped to learn more from the dinner.
“My life goal is to bridge the gap between Israel and Palestine,” Fleshler said. “We’ve appealed to the offices of Senators Dianne Feinstein and Barbara Boxer to show that we care about these issues. We need to seek a better deal.”
After student leaders sat down for dinner, Schnur introduced himself and set the stage for open dialogue.
“The debate is not whether there should be an agreement, but the debate is what kind of agreement makes the most sense and what can verify Iran’s promise to delay their nuclear capabilities or prohibit them from supporting terrorism in the Middle East,” Schnur said. “It’s not as much as a discussion of the Iran deal as respecting and listening to the other side and not demonizing them.”
Schnur then opened the debate up to the floor.
Audience members asked questions regarding the future of Iran, their attack capabilities, the role of Russia and China, if Iran will be allowed to fund more terrorism and how this deal will affect the U.S.-Israel relations.
“The policy piece is really complicated — each side has their own valid reasons for and against the deal,” said Aaron Rifkind, a senior majoring in international relations. “I learned that we need to come together if the bill is either rejected or passed.”
Schnur stressed the importance of collaboration to solve this issue.
“Too often we tend to listen to who we agree with and people can’t talk about these issues without anger and violence,” Schnur said.  “We need to come together to reach a 40-yard line solution.”
“Demonize the Other Side”. You must be kidding Mr. Schnur. The only people being demonized are the ones trying to achieve peace. Israel has no interest in peace. Once peace is achieved, Israel must stop stealing Palestinian land and denying them their basic human rights–something they have done to the tune of dislocating over 4million people into the ghettos of Gaza and the Occupied Territories. Israel is an apartheid state–look it up–there is no other conclusion.
Hillel is a front for AIPAC. This is a fact. It is against Hillel policy to criticize Israel in any way shape or form. This is a fact. You will never achieve a fair dialogue within Hillel. Never and you know this. Hillel’s sole purpose is to train student leaders, with free trips to Israel amongst other incentives, to support Israel in everything they do, whether it is in the interests of the U.S. or not. Many universities have left the AIPAC-run Hillel to form the new Hillel which actually encourages free uncensored dialogue, which may include the interests of the world over the selfish interests of Israel, alone.
So, to hold this event at, what is basically a professional lobbying organization for Israel, is a total farce. Shame on you Mr. Schnur. I understand the power and influence of Ms. Viterbi and her family. They are titans for USC. But, USC has a responsibility to present both sides of the issue in a real dialectic. How many Palestinian supporters attended. Not too many I suppose. Hillel does not allow for opposition to their causes, and they could only get away with this exclusion by holding the meeting off campus.
Congratulations, I hope everyone is excited to go to Israel next summer on AIPAC’s dime to get “Educated On the US/Israel Relationship”. After all, what could be more important? Maybe, peace in the Middle East.
Shame on you Mr. Schnur for leading in such a political farce. The USC family is not necessarily pro Israel. Stop acting like it is. This is a good deal for everyone–and that is why it will pass.
David – focus on your stance on the policy.  By taking cheap shots at faculty, students, organizations and donors it cripples not just your sentiment, but those who share your position as well … Not to mention it also makes you look like a whiney grump!
Yes, the bi-partisan  opposition is trumped by the partisan support. So much for an administration that brings us together. Please answer your phone, your village is looking for its idiot. Peace and Iran don’t belong in the same sentence.

The Marshall Sports Business Institute hosted Pac-12 Conference Commissioner Larry Scott and Athletic Director Pat Haden in the second installment of its ongoing “Business of Team Sports” event series on Wednesday at the Radisson Hotel near USC.
The conversation was moderated by David Carter, executive director of the Sports Business Institute and an associate professor at the Marshall School of Business. Both  discussed the current state and business of college football, in regard to significant accomplishments and challenges to the sport, as well as the Pac-12 conference in recent years and where they see it headed in the near future.
Scott has been relatively busy since leaving the Women’s Tennis Association to take over the conference in 2009. Since, he’s expanded the conference from 10 to 12 teams, enabling it to hold a conference championship game, launched the Pac-12 Networks and, in 2011, secured a landmark media rights deal with ESPN and FOX Sport that was worth approximately $3 billion over 12 years.
Scott kicked off the conversation by discussing all of the success that college football has had in regard to television ratings and contracts, attendance, the contesting of the College Football Playoff and conference championship games, and how that has resulted in college sports having a greater impact on society.
He quickly toned that sentiment down, though, when he brought up the notion that college sports is being examined more closely than ever before.
“I don’t think it’s ever been under the kind of scrutiny and pressure it’s under right now in terms of trying to [reconcile] big business and sports and entertainment with students that are at our campuses to receive an education and be successful in life beyond sports,” Scott said.
Echoing Scott’s remarks, Haden said the messaging about what it means to be a student-athlete is missing the mark at a conference and national level and is being hindered by what Haden called a “tsunami of lawsuits” that put athletic programs at tremendous risk.
“It’s an interesting, yet challenging time at the university level,” Haden said.
When discussing USC Athletics’ business model, Haden explained how USC loses $2 million per sport, with the exception of football and men’s basketball, creating about a $38 million void amongst 19 varsity programs.
“There’s a lot of revenue at the top, but the cost of sales is very high and this isn’t a very high margin business if you will,” Haden said.
Aside from the business side of things, both Scott and Haden have taken huge strides in recent years to improve the overall student-athlete experience.
Recently, the Pac-12 increased athletic scholarships to include the “full cost of attendance,” including food, guaranteed four-year athletic scholarships and increased medical coverage for its student-athletes.
In 2014, the Power Five conferences, including the Pac-12, were granted autonomy to write many of their own rules when it came to issues like student-athlete stipends and benefits.
“That was really a defining moment in the history of the NCAA when the five conferences were given flexibility to agree amongst ourselves,” Scott said.
When talking about the role the NCAA is going to play in five to 10 years, Scott said he believes that there’s going to be more flexibility for conferences, which will allow them to take care of their own student-athletes. He believes that as an institution, the NCAA will remain intact as a body to govern championships, create rules and regulations and conduct enforcement.
As a student-athlete once himself, Haden wants to see student-athletes receive more time off that would allow them to reap all of the benefits of the college experience, aside from college athletics.
While there are a variety of issues that Haden and the rest of athletic directors around the conference agree on, Scott said that a main challenge has been pooling each institution’s self interests to come up with compromises that would satisfy everyone’s wants and needs, all while continuing to grow the conference.
“Larry’s done a great job of building consensus amongst a diverse group of interests,” Haden said.
Scott went on to describe a conversation he had with former USC president Steven Sample while weighing whether to take the job with the Pac-12.
“He said to me at the time that USC is a very strong brand and brings a lot of value to the conference with all of the national championships, but USC isn’t getting the attention and respect it deserves for the success it’s had here because the conference is weak,” Scott said.
Since Scott has turned the conference into one of the toughest and most widely respected in the county from not only an athletic standpoint, but from an academic institution perspective as well.
“We strike the ultimate balance,” Scott said.
The conversation — which demonstrated the connection between two different types of athletic administrators who operate on both the university and conference level — was well received by the 300 or so professionals, alumni and students at the event.
“To have Commissioner Scott come down here to talk to people about what’s going on put some great perspective to the hundreds of people that were here that now better understand what an athletic director and conference commissioner face on a daily basis,” Carter said. “The business of college football is amazing, it’s huge and in L.A. with USC and UCLA, there’s really a lot of interest, especially with the season coming up.”
Should’ve also discussed why women’s sports out number men’s sports.
It’s because Title XI says that there has to be the same number of scholarships for women as men and Football uses 85 so we get Lacrosse, Rowing, Soccer, Cross Country and Beach Volleyball for women.  Men also have Baseball.
Yeah, I get it. That’s why I don’t like the Title IX schollie requirement, but hey…. what’s UCLAs excuse?  They have sports teams that we don’t.
They should have talked about the NCAA and their mistreatment of USC/Todd McNair.  How the University has allowed this to happen unchallenged is a huge black eye on the USC Administration.  Shame on them!

Football is officially back. I’ve waited for what seems to be an eternity to write those words. And while my excitement for the new season is at an all-time high, my enthusiasm for a sport I love has been greatly tarnished over the past offseason.
It seems that at every level of football, collegiate or professional, there is some sort of conspiracy or cover-up.
Take the NFL’s handling of Deflategate, for instance. After hiring “independent” investigator Ted Wells to conduct an investigation into the events of Deflategate, the NFL was able to conclude that Tom Brady may have known a ball boy deflated footballs during the AFC Championship Game.
It’s been almost eight months since the New England Patriots steamrolled the Indianapolis Colts 45-7, and there is still no resolution to the matter.
Tom Brady has appealed, been denied by “impartial” judge Roger Goodell, and now sits in court awaiting a decision on his four-game suspension. Though the case has been in court for a few weeks, the judge has yet to come to a verdict. He expects to rule by the end of the week, but with this case, who knows?
Deflategate is just one of the many situations the NFL has messed up over the past decade or so.
In fact, you may have been so caught up in the Deflategate drama that you could have missed the trailer for Will Smith’s new movie, Concussion. The movie centers on the work of Bennet Omalu, a pathologist, who discovered chronic traumatic encephalopathy after performing biopsies on several ex-NFL players.
For those of you who are unaware of the NFL’s handling of concussions, it isn’t pretty. When Omalu went to the NFL to discuss his work, he was rebuffed repeatedly. The NFL basically discredited any work by any scientist that wasn’t paid by the league. Sound familiar, Ted Wells?
The NFL eventually admitted that repeated head bashing was a serious problem in the league. After being sued by hundreds of former players, the league was mandated to set up a system to help retired players who suffered from CTE and other        brain-related diseases.
Will Smith’s movie promises to bring light to the struggle that Omalu went through in getting his work recognized by the NFL. I was genuinely happy that finally the NFL would be exposed for mishandling a vital situation. After botching the Ray Rice, Adrian Peterson and now Tom Brady cases, the NFL would have its unethical practices seen by millions of people.
Or so I thought.
While browsing through my Twitter feed on Wednesday morning, I came across a tweet from                       a fellow USC student.
In his tweet, the student said that Sony altered the movie Concussion so they wouldn’t anger the NFL.
After looking into the issue myself, I found that what Schwartz had said was true. According to emails leaked during the Sony hack, executives at the company, the director of the movie and representatives for Will Smith discussed ways to not antagonize the NFL, instead of focusing on telling the complete truth on the subject. Sony has since denied the allegations.
If the NFL has the power of censorship now, there’s basically no stopping Roger Goodell and company from accomplishing anything they please.
Its own players have slowly started turning against the league. During this past offseason, numerous players as young as 24 walked away from millions of dollars due to fears of their health and safety while playing football.
Star 49ers rookie linebacker Chris Borland was the biggest name to walk away after just one year.
When you have former players suing you and current players retiring over fear of health safety, you know you have a big problem on your hands. Instead of owning up to its mistakes, the NFL continues to look for ways to hide and cover up anything that will cast the league in a negative way.
Until the NFL allows truly “independent” researchers and investigators to come in, there will be no progressive change.
I, just like most of you reading this, will be watching college football this weekend and the NFL in a week’s time, despite all the wrong the NFL has done. And while the popularity of the sport has never been higher, football faces an uncertain future off the field.

Chopping wood · Junior walk-on kicker Alex Wood handled the kickoff duties in the Trojans’ final eight games last season. – Mariya Dondonyan | Daily Trojan
The Trojans began Wednesday’s practice addressing a replenished and superbly athletic special teams unit under coach Johnny Nansen. The influx of talent should dramatically improve the coverage issues from last season.
“We really value special teams play and spend a lot of time on it,” said coach Steve Sarkisian. “It showed last year in our return game, where we always want to be explosive and aggressive. But we need to develop consistency in our coverage units.”
Last year, USC had a pair of kicks blocked, allowed a scoring kickoff return and finished in the bottom five nationally in punt return defense, allowing 16.3 yards a return. They were also in the bottom 25 in net punting, averaging just 35 yards a punt and were in the bottom 30 in kickoff return defense, permitting 22.5 yards per kick.
“The number one thing that the coaches have been emphasizing this camp has been effort. We want to be more consistent on every play that we are out there,” starting redshirt senior punter Kris Albarado said after Wednesday’s practice. “We’ve been in this program for a year now under Nansen so the details are there. We just have to go out there and execute with greater effort.”
USC’s special teams is returning punter Kris Albarado, snapper Zach Smith, holder Conner Sullivan, kickoff man Alex Wood and primary kickoff returners Adoree’ Jackson and JuJu Smith-Schuster. Last season, USC averaged 9.7 yards on punt returns and 22.1 yards on kickoff returns.
With Agholor gone to the Eagles as a No. 1 pick, Jackson is now listed on top of the punt return depth chart.
“I did it in high school. It was pretty fun. I’ve seen Nelson do it, Marqise Lee do it. I just want to have fun with it,” Jackson said.
With his 684 yards on 23 returns, Jackson is already 14th on USC’s career return list. His two kickoff return touchdowns, 100 yards against Utah and 98 against Nebraska, were second nationally and his 29.7 yard-average per return was fifth. JuJu Smith had 11 returns for 132 yards, averaging 12.0 yards.
“You got to have vision,” Jackson said. “There are a lot of guys trying to wait for something to set up or wait for a cut. But if you’re looking for a cut, it could be open somewhere else. When you see something, you just have to hit it and hit it hard. The first thing I do when the ball is coming is secure it, then let’s go.”
Battling to replace Heidari, who finished his four year Trojan career kicking with a Pac-12 record 187 extra points in a Pac-12 record 193 attempts, will be junior walk-on Alex Wood, who was perfect on all 12 of his PAT tries when he was called up to fill in briefly last season.
“On a consistent basis, I’d like my range to be between 50 and 55 yards. I think that’s what we’re looking for. I think I can do that,” Wood said.
Wood’s leg strength on kickoffs clearly improved last season with 14 of his 48 kickoffs going for touchbacks and another 11 leaving opponents inside their own 20.
Wood has been named the starting kicker after a friendly competition with redshirt sophomore Matt Boermeester this offseason.
“We had a fantastic spring and are probably neck and neck,” Wood said. “It was kind of annoying, to be honest, because every time I make a kick he would come back and make one, and every time he’d make one I’d go make one, so it’s been good. It’s a good battle between us, and we’re making each other better definitely.”
There also is a pair of redshirt freshmen walk-on kickers in Wyatt Schmidt and Reid Budrovich.
Junior Zach Smith is back for his third year as USC’s snapper after filling that role on all placekicks and punts in 2014. Junior walk-on quarterback Conner Sullivan is in line to be the holder again on all placement kicks, which he handled seamlessly last year.
USC returns fifth-year senior Kris Albarado, with redshirt freshman Reid Budrovich behind him on the depth chart. After being asked to be a placement punter in 2013, Albarado raised his punting average by more than four yards to 41.4.
“Eleven more of his boots traveled at least 50 yards in 2014 on 60 punts than the previous year so the potential is there, although his percentage of punts inside the 20 declined by 7 percent,” Mike Herman of kickology.com said.
“[I am] just focusing on those details so I can be successful and the team can be successful,” Albarado said. “That is to win the field position battle to help us win the game. We want to give the same amount of effort for every single play. And that is obviously awesome effort because it’s tough to win.”
After Tuesday’s practice, Sarkisian announced that the Trojans will be also adding punter Chris Tilbey from City College of San Francisco.
Tilbey is originally from Melbourne, Australia, where he was part of the Pro Kick Australia program that has sent multiple kickers and punters to the NCAA and NFL ranks. In 13 games last year he had 54 punts with a 39.4 average, including 19 punts inside the 20.
“We’re really trying to invest into here for our future,” Sarkisian said.
Tilbey will be available to begin the season and is expected to play the next three at USC.

Heisman candidate · Dynamic sophomore cornerback Adoree’ Jackson is aiming to become the first defensive back to win the Heisman Trophy since Charles Woodson won the award back in 1997. – Nick Entin | Daily Trojan
It was another intense and physical practice for the Trojans Wednesday morning. Based on their play, both coaches and players are expecting a great performance on Saturday against Arkansas State.
Head coach Steve Sarkisian was pleased with the scout team’s work throughout practice.
“Our scout team guys make it hard,” Sarkisian said. “That’s how you get good.”
The team this year will have a total of 10 graduate students on the roster, with seven of them as starters. Sarkisian said the situation is similar to what the Stanford team had a few years ago  and the Boston College team had last year. He sees this as beneficial for the team this year.
“We’ve got guys that have been through it,” Sarkisian said. “They are mature enough to handle adversity.”
The team will come with some added maturity, but the freshmen are making just as big of an impact. Sarkisian said overall he is impressed with the way the freshmen have been playing. Quarterback Sam Darnold, outside linebacker and tight end Porter Gustin, defensive lineman Rasheem Green and offensive tackle Chuma Edoga  are some of the players that have impressed Sarkisian early this fall.
“We’ll find out a lot about these guys,” Sarkisian said. “And the guys comfortable enough to go in and play.”
Sarkisian talked a bit about why he’s impressed with Edoga in that he’s “a little unassuming but extremely athletic.” He said Edoga will play Saturday night.
“He’s a physical, nasty guy,” Sarkisian said. “He really likes to finish guys.”
Green, who suffered a knee injury, has been cleared to play Saturday. Sarkisian is impressed with his athletic ability, long arms and explosiveness.
“He’s made great progress coming off the injury,” Sarkisian said. “He’s looked really good.”
Redshirt senior tailback Tre Madden will finally get to see the field on Saturday once again after missing two of his past three seasons thanks to turf toe, a knee injury and hamstring injuries. In his time playing this fall, Madden has looked pretty good. Sarkisian was reminded of Madden’s explosiveness, cutting ability, acceleration and natural pass catching ability.
Sarkisian attributes Madden’s high football IQ to his time as a quarterback in high school and playing on both sides of the ball at USC. He even went on to say that Madden’s football IQ “is about as high as any running back I’ve been around.”
“I expect him to play really, really well Saturday night,” Sarkisian said. “I expect him to be our work horse.”
Defensive coordinator Justin Wilcox  talked about the fluidity with the safety position and said there are plenty of options on the table for the season. For his defense in general, Wilcox is looking to give a variety of guys playing time in order to create as many opportunities as he can for his players that will help the team win as much as possible.
“More guys are going to play, no doubt,” Wilcox said. “It gets them really excited.”
Similar to last year, sophomore three-way player Adoree’ Jackson is looking to play on both sides of the ball. Both Wilcox and Sarkisian agreed Jackson is a solid athlete.
Wilcox even joked about how since Jackson plays on both sides of the ball, he can almost be unstoppable at times — especially on offense.
“He’s about the only guy that covers himself,” Wilcox said. “He helps our team in a lot of different ways.”
Ideally, Wilcox would like to see Jackson get a lot of playing time on defense, but he knows that Sarkisian is doing what’s best for the team to win.
Sarkisian said that he believes Jackson has a high standard of performance because it’s what he’s always known. With Jackson’s natural ability, most times he makes what he does look easy.
At one point in practice on Wednesday, it looked as if Jackson might have been a bit frustrated that he missed a catch. Sarkisian pulled him aside really quick.
“I’m not worried about it,” Sarkisian told Jackson. “You’re going to catch it on Saturday.”
Sarkisian recalled that Jackson laughed a bit about his comment.
“No, I’m serious you will,” Sarkisian said. “We’re going to call it and you’ll catch it.”
Jackson joked that if he was frustrated about anything, it’s probably because he just got a little dirty.
“I’m always happy,” Jackson said. “That’s just who I am.”
From the look of practice, Sarkisian is expecting great plays from all of his players on Saturday and he is pleased with the depth being developed on the roster.
The Trojans will face the Arkansas State Red Wolves on Saturday at the Coliseum at 8 p.m. to kick off their 2015 campaign.

Hogwarts halls · The University of Melbourne has many period buildings, bringing an old-school vibe to attending class there. – Photo courtesy of University of Melbourne
Before starting at the University of Melbourne, I remember noticing a common theme in all of the pamphlets, web pages and videos I had parsed through. The university is known for its rigor, but also the amount of autonomy it gives  its students. Professor-student relationships are a rarity, despite the fact that professors are almost always addressed on a first-name basis. Lectures are not mandatory to attend, and they are recorded and posted on the university’s version of Blackboard, which professors call the “Learning Management System,” or “LMS.” However, in order to pass a class, one must attend at least 75 percent of all tutorial sessions and discussion sections held for each lecture.
The most sizeable difference I expected was the grading system. In looking through the handbook at potential classes I could take, the weight that was assigned to individual assignments proved to be especially shocking. I found it hard to wrap my head around the fact that grades rested almost completely on written assessments. Even more surprising, for one of my classes, 75 percent of the grade is derived from one 3,000 word essay.
These differences were the ones I expected; little did I know I was about to encounter so many more.
First, I had to learn a new language in order to talk about school. In an Australian university, a “course” refers to the degree in pursuit and each class is called a “subject.” Syllabi are called “subject guides” and courses are generally taught by multiple lecturers. Instead of letter grades A-F, students are awarded with a “pass” and several different classes of honors.
Going to class also meant experiencing some new things. In my first lecture for “Human Rights and Global Justice,” the professor began by honoring the land she stood on as those of aboriginal decedents. I found out later that is customary in first lectures. I felt fortunate in that the material in all my lectures was rather interesting, despite the fact that I started to notice there was a small language barrier. The professors may have been speaking English, but I found myself repeating back words like “methane,” “schedule” and “vitamin,” to name a few. The language barrier again worked to my disadvantage when members in my tutorial started laughing at my pronunciation of “aluminum,” as I did not pronounce it “ahli-umi-knee-um.”
I also realized, with a “zed” not an “s,” that everything printed on the slides was in British English. When I asked my tutors, with undertones of hilarity, if American English would be acceptable for essays, they generally laughed and said they could make an exception.
Probably what struck me the most was the first time I heard a professor curse during a lecture. Though I have heard profanity used in instances of reading literature or rhetoric or for comedic purposes, I am still unable to believe the comfort some professors have in using quite colorful profanity. My criminal law professor referred to a “f*cked up trial” as an example of a miscarriage of justice, and before I realized, I had written that in my notes verbatim.
Before starting my semester at “uni,” I thought I was, in general, a pretty self-motivated student. Though I have missed the occasional class or two, I always turned in assignments on time, participated in classes and so on. But in the past couple of weeks I have been here, I have realized how much more self-reliant I need to be in order to manage the workload. Like several other disciplines, the classes I am taking have only a couple assessments that are due all around the same time.
And like several other students, I have procrastination tendencies. In general, people see going abroad as taking a semester off in a way, and I found that mentality to be a hindering force immediately. When the due date of my first essay neared, and the dates of three others trailed behind, I realized that I needed to start exchanging procrastination for motivation. Undoubtedly, it’s difficult to remain motivated and on top of the workload while also trying to add in exploration and socialization, and it becomes even more difficult as the end of the semester nears. I had to quickly adopt new methods in order to remain focused on absorbing the full experience; I began to combine studying with adventures, seeking coffee shops and study spots in the parks on rare sunny days. I also have found the Hogwarts-like appearance of the university to be especially encouraging. I have been using weekend trips as deadlines as well, so I do not have to think about writing that essay on multilateral environmental agreements while laying in the sun at Manly Beach in Sydney.
Despite the minor difficulties I have encountered while trying to meet the rather high expectations the University of Melbourne has created, I am happy I decided to study at a university abroad and at this one in particular. Like USC, the professors here are at the top of their respective fields and have endless experience to draw from. Though the workload might be rather difficult to manage at times, especially when trying to balance the overall study abroad experience, the environment remains conducive to learning, as everyone seems to have a genuine passion. Evidently, this semester is shaping up to one full of learning.

Nice article that gives light to what int’l students can expect when they come from afar
 to study at USC with a new culture. In fact, being an international student isn’t easy,
given our complex culture and language. Assistance must come from numerous sources
to aid these young people embarking on life’s journey. A new award-winning worldwide
book/ebook that aids anyone coming to the US is “What Foreigners
Need To Know About America From A To Z: How to Understand Crazy American
Culture, People, Government, Business, Language and More.” It is used in
foreign Fulbright student programs and endorsed worldwide by ambassadors,
educators, and editors. It also identifies “foreigners” who became successful
in the US and how they contributed to our society, including students.  
   A chapter on education explains how to be
accepted to an American university and cope with a confusing new culture,
friendship process and daunting classroom differences. Some stay after
graduation. It has chapters that explain how US businesses operate and how to
get a job (which differs from most countries), a must for those who want to
work for an American firm here or overseas. 
   It also has chapters that identify the most common English grammar and
speech problems foreigners have and tips for easily overcoming them, the
number one stumbling block they say they have to succeeding here. 
   Most struggle in their efforts and need guidance from schools’ international departments,
immigration protection, host families, concerned neighbors and fellow
students, and informative books like this to extend a cultural helping hand so
we all have a win-win situation.  Good luck to all wherever you study!

On Sept. 2, the USC Fisher Museum of Art opened its doors with two new exhibitions. The first exhibit, Gyre: The Plastic Ocean, features works of all art mediums conveying the realities of global plastic pollution. Also on display is Cynthia Minet: Beast of Burden, which presents art created almost exclusively out of recycled plastics, such as toys, milk bottles and everyday items.
Gyre: The Plastic Ocean investigates “issues of the contemporary culture of consumption and its consequences on nature,” according to its press release. The installation, which first opened in 2014 at the Anchorage Museum, features Los Angeles-based artist Cynthia Minet’s multimedia sculpture “Pack Dogs,” which intricately combines recycled plastics and LED lights molded into five Husky dogs pulling a sleigh.
“The colors of the dogs represent the Aurora Borealis,” said Minet, who created the sculpture specifically for this exhibition. “The order of the colors represents the sequence of colors in the Borealis.”
Plans for the arrival of Gyre: The Plastic Ocean have been in the works since early 2014, according to Fisher Museum curator Ariadni Liokatis. In the spring of that year, Fisher Museum curators approached Minet to commission a solo exhibit to accompany “Pack Dogs.”  Cynthia Minet: Beast of Burden is exclusive to the Fisher Museum and features illuminated sculptures similar to those seen in her past exhibit, Unsustainable Creatures, including a series of raptors suspended from the ceiling.
Gyre: The Plastic Ocean also features a colossal work by Atlanta-based artist Pam Longobardi. The sculpture, entitled “Bounty, Pilfered,” is shaped from ocean plastic and drift nets found by the artist herself on the beaches of North America and Greece, as well as the North Pacific Gyre.  The materials are sculpted into a cornucopia of black plastic with ocean debris cascading out from the hollow.
“[The title] is a direct reference to BP Oil,” said Longobardi, alluding to the catastrophic Deepwater Horizon oil spill in 2010 for which BP Oil has been held responsible. “The ocean is getting all this [pollution], and it’s vomiting it back up on beaches all over the world — and I go and find it.”
In addition to Longobardi’s work, the exhibition also features art by Evelyn Rydz, Fran Crowe and Dianna Cohen.  Cohen, a Los Angeles native, is no stranger to plastic; she began using plastic bags as her primary medium more than 20 years ago.
“We think of plastic as this thing that represents the future and all these great things that we depend upon,” Cohen said.  “It’s such an interesting and loaded material.”
Cohen is also the CEO of Plastic Pollution Coalition, which she co-founded in 2009.  The alliance has expanded into a global organization working to stop plastic pollution and encourage people to reduce their plastic footprint.
“Plastic pollution has no boundaries,” Cohen said.  “It’s become much more prevalent at the beach, in the sand and in the water.”
Cynthia Minet: Beast of Burden is on display until Oct. 10. Gyres: The Plastic Ocean is on display until Nov. 21.

Known for its over-the-top parties, beautiful mansions and sometimes elitist attitudes, the greek system at USC and other universities is no stranger to criticism. There seems to always be a story in the news about a fraternity’s dangerous hazing practices or a sorority’s harsh and demeaning emails. Most recently, critics have claimed a recruitment video from the University of Alabama chapter of Alpha Phi shows a lack of diversity. However, the recruitment video itself is not what’s wrong with the system. The problem is that, as a result of a stereotypical portrayal of greek life in the media, sorority recruitment videos are forced to target a very specific type of girl — hindering the chance at diversity.
The four minute recruitment video, which was deleted from YouTube shortly after going viral, showcases beautiful white, blonde girls and not much else. It opened up the doors for a bigger debate about the exclusivity of the greek system — an important issue on every college campus that sustains greek life. Many young girls at college campuses across the country who have gone through sorority recruitment have seen videos almost identical to Alpha Phi’s. By showing off the most physically attractive girls in the house, the videos are used as a marketing technique to attract new members.
The greek system is almost always portrayed the same way in the media and in pop culture, ultimately limiting the types of members sororities and fraternities recruit. For example, the popular television show Greek, which aired a few years ago on ABC Family, based its plot off the premise of beautiful college girls meeting beautiful college guys, both of whom care little about their academics or futures and more about “Greek Week” and social mixers. And in the iconic movie Legally Blonde, Elle Woods and her gang of blonde sorority friends seem to lack substance and intelligence, a portrayal that contributes to the stereotype that all sorority girls are superficial beings who have little to offer on their campuses, let alone in society. Rarely in these movies do we see the thousands of dollars women in sororities raise for philanthropic causes or the prestigious internships they land. Much like the Alpha Phi recruitment video, glitter and bikinis are the only things featured when sororities are mentioned, but in reality, the girls that make up these houses are much more than that.
Therefore, when a girl moves in to her dorm and her new roommate says, “Hey! Are you planning on rushing?” and her only exposure to sororities is the one portrayed in movies and on television, these stereotypes come to mind. If she is not gorgeous, skinny, rich or overly feminine, she may fear the process and the system as a whole, believing she won’t fit in. As one type of girl rushes sororities and other girls believe the greek system has little to offer for them, the cycle that limits diversity sustains itself. The poor portrayal of the greek system in the media is only one piece in solving a much more complicated question about diversity in sororities, but it constitutes an important perception for potential participants in the system. One cannot expect a more diverse greek system until the media more accurately represents the diverse aspects of real-life members.
With all of this in mind, there is one more vital thing to remember about the greek system: Sororities are not marketing toward the general public, but rather toward people who they think would be interested — which is no different than any other club or group on campus. The problem is not the sororities’ marketing techniques, but rather that the media has forced them to only have one target audience. The Alpha Phi chapter at University of Alabama shouldn’t be judged for doing this, nor should any other chapter. Rather than put down the members of these greek organizations for lacking diversity, we should focus more energy on figuring out how to get Hollywood to move away from these harsh and lazy stereotypes.

Perhaps one of the most stressful aspects of college life is registering for courses and organizing a class schedule. As if stressing about homework, exams and papers is not  enough, the process of registering for classes with USC’s Web Registration adds another layer of pressure and hassle each semester. Web Registration, to be frank, is egregiously outdated. In today’s world in which we are constantly connected, Web Registration is anachronistic in the face of other websites like Amazon or LinkedIn. And at a school like USC, it’s difficult and confusing to reconcile a university that prides itself on the cutting edge, yet still utilizes a site that rivals an old-school chat room on Hotmail. The process of registering for classes is stressful enough — it’s time for the administration to streamline the system and make it easier to navigate, search and register for courses.
To be clear, there is nothing wrong with the courses offered or the schedule of classes itself. But the way students access the catalog, add courses and register is outmoded. To even get to Web Registration, you have to either log in through myUSC and click on “Web Registration” or search “USC web registration” and click a link to the site. Through the latter, you have to sign in using your student ID and password — one which is completely different than the password used for myUSC. Once you’ve signed in and chosen a semester, it’s tab time. To clearly manage adding classes and viewing your schedule, you’re better off opening up separate tabs in your browser for the department list, course bin and calendar view to see which classes are available, which ones you’ve added (and can later unschedule or remove) and view your classes in a calendar format to see if there are any conflicts. Jumping between each category and making sure everything is squared away is cumbersome and superfluous. There are just too many hurdles to cross to identify a conflict, unschedule a class, remove the class, add another class to replace it and then check if that has a conflict as well. By the time you do that, you’ll be timed out or automatically signed out and directed to the direct login page that you most likely will not know the password for because you logged in through myUSC. Furthermore, there are no course descriptions or methods to search for a specific class, professor or time/day.
The site itself isn’t bad if it launched in 2005. There is something fundamentally flawed when it is easier to make an appointment on the website of the DMV than it is to register for “Arts of Asia.” Navigating the site is too archaic in terms of today’s standards of technology.
The Office of the Registrar and the Office of the Provost need to revamp Web Registration and make it easier, faster and more user-friendly for students to sign up for classes and organize their schedule. Students should be able to search by a number of filters and view the catalog of classes more easily. Perhaps there should even be a method of inputting the classes you wish to take in which the system offers a number of possible schedules you can register for. Let’s say you wanted to take two cinema classes, a French course and a General Education course, you did not want classes on Fridays and you preferred morning classes — you could then input those preferences and be presented with a list of possible schedules with dates, times and the availability of the classes. Or even more simply, students could view what a class is about or the level of difficulty of a course. Rather than splitting one’s time between a course bin and calendar view, combine the two fields and students can add or remove a class more easily if there is a conflict.
Any improvements are welcome improvements. Today’s Web Registration is ill-equipped to help students. Just as other sites students use, such as Financial Aid, have been updated and made easier to navigate, it’s time to update the process and system we use to register for our classes.
As our good friend would say, “Are you sure you want to drop ‘USC: Web Registration’?” Yes, I would.

Former USC linebacker Morgan Breslin is suing his alma mater for breach of contract, negligence and fraud by intentional misrepresentation, alleging that school representatives misguided him into purchasing a disability insurance policy that he was later unable to claim following an injury that would eventually end his career.
Breslin, who played for the Trojans in 2012 and 2013, filed the lawsuit in Los Angeles Superior Court on Aug. 28. He is seeking unspecified damages.
The suit claims that Breslin, 24, purchased “a total and permanent disability insurance policy that, in theory, protected him in the event he was unable to play in the NFL due to an injury sustained while playing for USC.” Breslin ultimately purchased the policy from Amtrust at Lloyd’s, part of Amtrust, a multinational property and casualty insurance company, “based upon the advice and representations of USC.”
The claim states that “USC directed Breslin in every step related to the policy” and purportedly breached its contract with Breslin by “failing to manage plaintiff Breslin’s relationship with Amtrust on Breslin’s behalf.”
After “Breslin was unable to play football and was rendered totally and permanently disabled as defined by the policy,” he made a claim under the policy in May of 2014 that was denied in December of the same year, according to the suit.
Following the denial, Amtrust filed a separate lawsuit in the state of New Jersey seeking to have Breslin’s policy “declared void,” citing “that the application, which Breslin completed with USC’s assistance, and the medical information that USC provided directly to the underwriter, contained material omission and misstatements.”
Prior to the 2013-2014 season, Breslin was designated as an Exceptional Student-Athlete by the NCAA, a program that offers incentives to student-athletes to stay in school, complete their degrees and play another year by giving student-athletes the opportunity to purchase disability insurance.
The suit reads that Breslin and USC had reached a contractual agreement wherein USC promised to “manage Plaintiff Breslin’s relationship with Amtrust on Breslin’s behalf” in return for Breslin’s promise to “forgo the NFL draft and remain at USC and play football.”
Under this same contract, USC purportedly agreed to “pay for all medical costs incurred by Breslin” while at USC. According to the lawsuit, USC’s breach of this aforementioned contract is the primary reason for Breslin’s decision to seek unspecified damages.
The suit also alleges that USC interfered with Breslin’s right to receive benefits from the insurance by controlling the flow of information between him and Amtrust.
Breslin, who recorded 13 sacks and 19.5 tackles for loss in 2012, sustained a hip injury that took place in a 62-41 loss to Arizona State in September 2013 — the same game that ended up resulting in the dismissal of head coach Lane Kiffin on the tarmac of Los Angeles International Airport.
A couple weeks after his injury, Ed Orgeron, who was the interim head coach at the time, went on to say that Breslin was one of his favorite players to coach during the course his career.
After Breslin went undrafted in the 2014 NFL draft, he had a brief stint with the San Francisco 49ers as a free agent, but did not make the team’s roster.
Breslin and attorneys were unavailable for comment regarding the suit. The University said it does not comment on pending litigation.
