USC announced in late August that its School of Social Work’s Children’s Data Network received an $800,000 grant from the Conrad N. Hilton Foundation to help further develop the new research project.
The CDN is directed by Emily Putnam-Hornstein and Jacquelyn McCroskey of the School of Social Work. It originally received its funding from First 5 LA for analyses on early childhood, from infancy to 5 years of age. The grant money from will expand the project to acquire and study existing data that focuses on transitioning youths out of the foster care system.
“We know it’s really important to look at young children to start with, but they do get older, so we approached the Hilton Foundation because we knew about their focus on transitional issues,” McCroskey said.
The goal of the CDN is to link administrative records that can be used to study children’s experiences across agencies and departments.
“We can bring our research expertise, our analytic expertise, to looking at data that already exists and helping the agencies that are on the front lines of providing services take a better look at what the patterns and trends are,” McCroskey said. “Emily [Putnam-Hornstein] and I are really hoping that by linking data across agencies we can support a better understanding of programs and policies.”
Much of the analysis is done on campus by faculty and graduate students. Ivy Hammond, who is currently pursuing a master’s degree in social work, is part of the research team for the CDN.
“I feel incredibly fortunate to have this opportunity,” Hammond said. “The CDN is in its early stages, and we’re really trying to grow the infrastructure. It is a scary thing to invest in a new project like the CDN, so it’s great that First 5 LA and the Hilton Foundation [are] willing [to] do that.”
Hammond sees the work the CDN is doing affecting people throughout both the university and the larger community.
“We’re all about painting a full picture of children and their families,” she said. “It’s definitely an interdisciplinary approach that could include students in the law school, medical school and all different fields.”
Kechen Zhao, who is currently in his fourth year of the biostatistics Ph.D. program, does statistical analysis for the network.
“The CDN is a project that allows me to expose myself to real problems,” Zhao said. “When we do mathematical problems, we always do hypothetical situations and models, but CDN is the first experience for me to apply what I’ve learned from my courses to solve a real-world issue.”
Zhao said the program brings together a diverse group of people.
“The CDN is a really exciting program in the fact that the ways researchers are looking at these issues are really innovative,” he said. “It also draws many agencies and people with different backgrounds to get involved. It’s kind of like you combine academic people with politicians, and we have to work together to somehow make change happen. I’m really looking forward to seeing where the program goes in the future.”

The USC Eye Institute, a division of Keck Medicine of USC, has begun a new demographic-specific study for residents in Inglewood called the African American Eye Disease Study.
Eye spy · According to research from the USC Keck School of Medicine, African-Americans are at greater risk for diabetic macular edema. – Ralf Cheung | Daily Trojan
In August, research by ophthalmology scientists from Keck showed that African-Americans have the highest incidence of diabetic macular edema, a disease that causes blindness in diabetic people, of any ethnic group.
The institute, which has offered free eye exams in the past, is extending these services as part of its new study.
The study will take place over the course of three years. The eye examinations, which are free of charge and voluntary, include an informational patient interview.
“We give a very detailed eye exam, staffed all by USC. It is not only beneficial to the patients themselves, but also beneficial to the future generations to help the needs within the community,” said Dr. Mina Torres, director of research studies at the Eye Institute.
The study’s primary focus is on providing quality eye examinations and research to African-Americans over the age of 40 who reside in Inglewood with the hope that this information can be helpful to African-Americans nationwide. The study is aimed at developing a further understanding of how eye disease affects this specific demographic.
“[The study] allows us to learn not only the eye health of African-Americans, but also to see if this is across populations and in conjunction with what we learned from our previous studies,” Torres said.
Past research spearheaded by the Eye Institute has shown that Native American ancestry increases the risk of diabetic retinopathy in Latino populations. Diabetic retinopathy refers to damaged blood vessels in the retina, and the progression of the disease can cause blindness.
“There hasn’t been a study like this one before, and technology has changed, ways of treatment have changed, and we really don’t have any recent data,” Torres said. “That’s what we are looking for. The Inglewood community is very supportive of us and [has] already taken advantage of 250 eye exams since April.”
The USC Eye Institute has conducted two previous studies, the Los Angeles Latino Eye Study and the Chinese America Eye Study. AFEDS is the first study of its kind in the United States to focus on African-Americans as a demographic.
Diabetic macular edema and diabetic retinopathy are treatable, and the study’s leaders hope to increase awareness and prevention among communities at risk for the diseases.
“There is not enough vision screening for DME among diabetics, yet there are much better therapies available that are covered by insurance,” Dr. Rohit Varma, director of the USC Eye Institute and professor and chair of ophthalmology at the Keck School of Medicine at USC, said in a statement on Keck’s website. “We hope that our research will help those in the position to influence policy to get a better handle on costs and where the need for treatment is the greatest.”

California State Senator Mark Wyland (R-Escondido) and former State Assemblyman Anthony Portantino (D-Pasadena) were announced as mentors for the Visiting Fellows Program, formerly known as Legislators-in-Residence, by the Jesse M. Unruh Institute of Politics at the Dornsife College of Letters, Arts and Sciences.

Visiting Fellows is a program that was created last fall through the Unruh Institute, which strives to aid undergraduate students in the field of politics and public policy with the guidance of local elected officials. From their experience in state politics, Wyland and Portantino will offer students an interactive approach to understanding the rigor of shaping public policy by monitoring various events, such as round table discussions and student forums. As mentors of the program, Wyland and Portantino offer a change in discourse for many students. While working closely with state-elected officials, students are encouraged to envision a life of real-world politics, gaining insight and preparation for the future.
“It is very important for us that USC students understand that there is a role for young people in politics and public service,” Unruh Institute Director Dan Schnur said. “We want our legislators to give students an understanding of how the political process works, but we also want to make sure that they explain to the students that they don’t have to be 40 or 50 years old to make a difference.”
Schnur also said that Wyland and Portantino’s record of bipartisanship will be an asset to the institute.
“Not only are Wyland and Portantino very smart and experienced in public service, but they both gained a reputation in the legislature for being able to work across party lines,” he said. “We want USC students to get involved in politics, but we also want them to learn how to work with people with whom they don’t always agree.”
Wyland has been in state office since 2000, when he was elected into the California Assembly. In 2006, he was elected senator of the 38th Congressional District, representing San Diego County and parts of Orange County. His passion for K-12 education in California led to his role as vice chair of the Senate Education Committee. Through his role in the Committee, Wyland garners legislative interest to various initiatives in educational reform, such as improvements in charter and public school education. Wyland joins the Visiting Fellows Program with hopes of promoting higher student literacy in public policy and politics.
“I think it is important that everyone, certainly students, understand both public policy, politics and forming policy, because it is rarely one or the other,” Wyland said.
Portantino, who is also an adjunct professor of political science at USC, returns for his second year as a Visiting Fellows mentor at the Unruh Institute this fall. Portantino is currently teaching a new political science course at Dornsife this fall called “Values Based Political Leadership and Public Policy.”
“I want to inspire young people to look at a career in public policy as a place to make a difference — it is an outstanding career path to work on,” Portantino said. “Whether the topic is science, business or the environment, public policy is a place to make a difference and I hope to inspire people to make it their career.”

In the weeks leading up to last summer’s Comic-Con International in San Diego, rumors were swirling like a cloak of levitation around Marvel Studios and its long-rumored big-screen treatment of Doctor Strange, the master of the mystic arts and sometime superhero whose arrival promises to inject Marvel’s ever-expanding cinematic universe with a welcome dose of the supernatural. The studio had already hired Scott Derrickson, the genre-friendly filmmaker behind Sinister and The Exorcism of Emily Rose, and fan expectations soared after the news broke that Joaquin Phoenix was in final talks to play the doctor himself. But Comic-Con came and went, and although convention-goers were treated to star-studded panels and exclusive sneak previews of Avengers: Age of Ultron and Ant-Man, no official announcement was made regarding Doctor Strange.

So what’s the hold-up? After all, Marvel is smack-dab in the middle of its most successful year to date. Last spring’s Captain America: The Winter Soldier proved that superhero flicks can be bold and topical without losing touch with their four-color origins, while August’s Guardians of the Galaxy, a film once viewed as a considerable box office risk, recently crossed the $500 million mark worldwide thanks to the wry, irreverent direction of James Gunn and the universal appeal of profanity-spewing raccoons, attractive green-skinned aliens and dancing Baby Groots. So why not strike while the iron is hot? The answer, as it turns out, might be very simple: One man is refusing to say the magic words.
Joaquin Phoenix is unquestionably an exceptional talent, one who could easily project both the arrogance and nobility inherent in Stephen Strange. From the teenage lunkhead driven to murder by Nicole Kidman’s devious weathergirl in Gus Van Sant’s media satire To Die For to the sneering, incestuous Emperor Commodus in Ridley Scott’s Gladiator to his tragic, tortured take on Johnny Cash in James Mangold’s Walk the Line, this is an actor who gives himself to an almost unnerving extent, crawling so deep inside his characters that one wonders how he’s ever able to find his way out again. Yet the world of the effects-driven blockbuster — especially one with a potentially limitless supply of contractually obligated sequels — is largely foreign to him, so it’s easy to see why he might be reluctant to sign on for a role that could conceivably limit his professional options and stifle his growth as a performer.
The last time Hollywood threatened to cast him in the mold of the conventional leading man, Phoenix rebelled by staging a controlled public meltdown that was used as fodder for the polarizing mockumentary I’m Still Here, featuring Phoenix as a bedraggled, mumbling version of himself who elects to forsake acting in favor of an ill-advised foray into hip-hop, heavy drug use and unprotected sex with a parade of progressively aggressive prostitutes. The film, directed by Phoenix’s friend and brother-in-law Casey Affleck as a muddled commentary on the pressures of the celebrity-publicity system, confounded the majority of critics and audiences when it was released in 2010, but it seemed to rekindle something within Phoenix, igniting the fire that would go on to fuel his two greatest performances: the damaged war veteran who falls for the honey-toned platitudes of a wily cult leader (Philip Seymour Hoffman) in Paul Thomas Anderson’s The Master and the lovesick dreamer who finds companionship with his smart phone in Spike Jonze’s Her.
Casting Phoenix as Doctor Strange would be a calculated risk for Marvel as well. The studio is primarily known for stocking its films with relative unknowns, at least when it comes to the leads. Chris Evans and Chris Hemsworth weren’t even close to being household names before they signed on Marvel’s the dotted line. Robert Downey, Jr., whose career was in dire need of resuscitation before he was cast in the first Iron Man, is the exception that proves the rule.
Marvel’s reasons for adopting this policy are three-fold: 1) Casting no-names ensures that star power won’t overwhelm the superhero persona in question; 2) These actors will command smaller paychecks, at least at first; 3) This in turn allows smaller roles to go to more established actors (think of Anthony Hopkins in Thor or Glenn Close in Guardians of the Galaxy), who will lend their gravitas to the project without griping about long shooting schedules or trying to assert creative control. If Phoenix lands the role, the film will be at the mercy of a brilliant but mercurial personality, similar to what Marvel experienced when Edward Norton rewrote the script for 2008’s The Incredible Hulk and balked when studio executives told him they were sticking with an earlier draft.
No matter who ends up playing him, adapting Doctor Strange was always going to be a challenge. The powers and abilities of the character, co-created by Stan Lee and Steve Ditko, have gone through multiple revisions since his 1963 debut in the pages of Strange Tales, but like many superheroes, his origin remains essentially the same: a brilliant but prideful neurosurgeon named Stephen Strange is forced to give up his practice after a debilitating car accident causes uncontrollable tremors in his hands. Desperate to restore his dexterity, Strange searches the world for a cure, eventually stumbling upon an ageless hermit known as the Ancient One. The kindly mage senses the doctor’s untapped potential for good and agrees to take him on as his disciple after Strange helps the old man defeat the treacherous conjurer Baron Mordo.
This deceptively simple backstory has given rise to a dedicated niche fandom over the years, including filmmakers Wes Craven and Guillermo del Toro, both of whom have attempted to mount their own big-screen versions of Doctor Strange, only to be met with either general disinterest or ill-timed studio restructuring.
The comic series itself, with its psychedelic imagery and freewheeling references to Eastern mysticism, was enthusiastically embraced by the 1960s counterculture, and its back issues are still a trip to read today. If Derrickson can find a way to transcend the tried-and-true Marvel formula and tap into the same creative wellspring Lee and Ditko once drew from, having an actor of Phoenix’s caliber in the role won’t just be an advantage; it will be a necessity.

USC School of Cinematic Arts graduates Aneesh Chaganty and Sev Ohanian experienced life-changing moments through their short film “Seeds,” which they shot entirely with Google Glass. Google Glass is a completely hands-free way to connect with the internet through the use of voice command.

The project began on campus after SCA professor Norman Hollyn brought the opportunity to the attention of Ohanian. “One honest two-minute film can change your life,” said Aneesh Chaganty of his experience filming “Seeds”, a short film shot entirely with Google Glass. Chaganty and Sev Ohanian, both graduates of the SCA.
“Google Glass was running a small program called ‘The Creative Collective’ throughout the country to see how the product could be implemented as a filmmaking tool,” Ohanian said. “I had to put together a team. When tasked with finding a great director, I brought on Aneesh instantly, knowing that he would have both the creative skillset and passion for story to pull it off.”
From here, Ohanian and Chaganty began a month-and-a-half long filmmaking endeavor that would not only jumpstart their careers, but change the way people view Google Glass technology.
“From day one, Sev [Ohanian] and I wanted to do something no one had ever done before,” Chaganty said. “Rather than just using the Glass and telling just another short film on it, we wanted to take a lot of the concerns the public had with the product and address [them] in the most epic and emotional way we could.”
The film outlines the story of a young man who travels from the United States to a village in India where his mother resides in order to share with her the ultrasound photos of her grandchild. The shooting of the film required traveling more than 9,500 miles from Los Angeles to South India. Chaganty, who wasn’t only director, camera operator and actor, also served as a translator of Telugu, which is a language spoken in the villages where they were filming.
“I remember standing outside the open door of a moving train at five in the morning, recording the sunrise as we sped through Indian countryside,” Chaganty said. “I would be lying if I said I didn’t have a suspicion right there that the world would really like what we were making.”
Chaganty’s premonition rang true as the video got more than 2 million views in the first few hours following its online debut.
“Looking back on it now, it’s funny to think that Google didn’t even know what we were shooting until it was all done,” Chaganty said. “The final product got just enough people excited for them to make a massive exception to their own rules and showcase an independent project on their official YouTube channel.”
Though it has received the most recognition, “Seeds” is not the first collaboration between Ohanian and Chaganty. Their first major project was an original screenplay they wrote titled Animal Heist, about a group of outsiders who band together in an attempt to steal a 400-pound gorilla from the Los Angeles Zoo. The two filmmakers entered a competition with 3,500 other screenplays and placed in the top 20.
“It was [our] first screenplay,” Chaganty said. “Writing it together was one of the most absorbing, stimulating and satisfying creative experiences I’ve ever had.”
Since graduation, Ohanian has produced the feature film Fruitvale Station with fellow SCA graduate Ryan Coogler, which ended up winning the Grand Jury Prize for a dramatic film at the 2013 Sundance Film Festival. Additionally, he has worked on multiple feature films for James Franco’s Rabbit Bandini Productions and just wrapped an independent film starring Cobie Smulders and Guy Pearce in Texas. Ohanian also teaches a few courses at USC.
“One of the main lessons that I push in my producing class, based on my real-life experiences, is that the majority of producing and filmmaking happens outside of meetings, outside of productions and outside of emails,” Ohanian said. “Everything from the way a producer carries themselves, to how they interact with every member of the crew, has a huge impact on a production. I make it a point to not only discuss how to make good movies, but how to be good people while doing it.”
Chaganty, who is only 23, made his biggest wave in the film industry with “Seeds.” Following the viral success of the video, Google offered him a yearlong position in the Creative 5, an elite group of five recent graduates from across the world to help manage the Google brand.
“We’ll be making spots, interactive projects and hopefully some of those cool Google doodles we see everyday,” Chaganty said.
 
Editor’s note: The original post misidentified Aneesh Chaganty as Sev Ohanian. The post has been updated to reflect those changes.

It’s that time of the season again: time for hordes of rowdy USC students and proud alumni to take over the Bay Area for the annual Weekender.
Though the trip to San Francisco is always entertaining, this year might shape up to be the best Weekender game in the last four years.
Since I was a spring admit my freshman year, I didn’t make the trip in 2011 — I just watched the game on TV. USC played against California at San Francisco’s AT&T Park while Cal’s Memorial Stadium was being renovated. I was especially excited to watch the game to see Cal safety Stefan McClure play, since he went to my rival high school and torched us on offense and defense every year.
USC cruised past an outmatched Cal team by a score of 30-9. A young Marqise Lee beat McClure down the sideline for a 39-yard touchdown catch in the first quarter, and my love affair with the Weekender began.
But 2012 was a rough year for my relationship with the Weekender. You could say the Weekender cheated on me. You could say I walked in on the Weekender cheating on me in my own bed.
The trip started off with my car breaking down, and I should have known it was doomed from the start. My friends and I were stranded on the side of the freeway in the middle of nowhere until a tow truck took us to Bakersfield, the home of then-backup quarterback Cody Kessler.
I still think Kessler and that Pep Boys are the only redeeming things about that city.
The game at Stanford the next day added insult to injury. USC had entered the season ranked No. 1 in the country and was ranked No. 2 at the time despite taking care of business in its first two games. (I’m looking at you, Associated Press and Coaches Polls.) Stanford was ranked No. 21 following Andrew Luck’s departure for the NFL. Matt Barkley had come back for his senior season, and USC’s athletic department was already deep into its “Barkley for Heisman” campaign.
Despite looking mediocre all game, the Trojans held a 14-7 lead in the third quarter, but then everything started going wrong — Stanford tied the game up at the end of the third quarter and went ahead 21-14 early in the fourth.
Barkley’s Heisman hopes were over after he threw two picks and failed to lead USC down the field in the last few minutes. “Tailback U” put up a total of 26 rush yards. The sold out Stanford crowd rushed the field, and the USC students in the stands stood there, mouths agape, crushed.
That game turned out to be the beginning of the end for USC in 2012. The team sputtered to a 7-6 finish, including losses to Arizona, Oregon, Notre Dame and UCLA, and fell completely out of the national rankings by the end. I look back on that game and shudder, and I’m sure you all do too.
But all of the fans who made it out to the 2013 Weekender knew that the result would turn out better. At the time, Cal was 1-8, with its sole win coming against Portland State. USC, on the other hand, was 6-3 and was infused with a new energy under interim head coach Ed Orgeron.
My friends and I spent all of Friday in the city, bumping into Trojan fans everywhere and filling Fisherman’s Wharf with “Fight On” cheers. We also fell victim to the infamous Bushman jumping out at us. I won’t pretend I didn’t scream like a little girl.
And the game? It was a blast.
Trojans swarmed the Cal tailgates down the hill from Memorial Stadium, which was a sign of the game to come. USC had a field day with the Bears, running up a 62-28 score.
My cousin had just transferred to Cal to play defensive end, so it was the first time I got to see him play (and he got wrecked — sorry, Kyle). I spent the entire third quarter sitting across from USC’s student section with my grandparents, uncle and cousin. I profusely apologized for how badly we were beating the Bears, since my grandpa is a lifelong Cal fan.
This year, No. 14 USC heads to No. 13 Stanford, which is coming off a 45-0 walloping of UC Davis in its first game. The Kevin Hogan-led Cardinal will surely provide a formidable opponent. The game will serve as a litmus test for first-year head coach Steve Sarkisian’s offense and will prove Kessler’s true worth this season.
If you’re reading this in print, that means you’re probably not headed up to the game, but I hope you all make it up to the Weekender at least once in your college career.
Fight On and Beat the Farm!

The last time the USC men’s water polo team encountered the Pacific Tigers, the battle ended with the Trojans rejoicing over their sixth straight NCAA championship. There won’t be a title on the line this time, but the fresh-faced Trojans will have to go through the Tigers once again when they open the 2014 season at the UCSD Triton Invitational Sept. 6 and 7 and begin the hunt for their seventh straight championship.
Lap it up · Senior driver Kostas Genidounias is the veteran leader of the Trojans this year. USC is aiming to win its seventh straight national title. – Ralf Cheung | Daily Trojan
The No. 2 Trojans will play No. 11 UC Davis and unranked La Verne on Saturday and Redlands on Sunday morning before going up against No. 5 Pacific in a rematch of last year’s NCAA finals Sunday afternoon. The Trojans defeated the Tigers 12-11 in overtime in last year’s finals to finish the season 28-4.
Head coach Jovan Vavic and his team aim to get off on the right foot with a sweep of their first tournament this weekend. Vavic emphasized the importance of starting strong in a conference marked by top-tier rivals Cal, Stanford and UCLA.
“Our conference is so competitive that one loss can actually take you out of [national tournament] play,” Vavic said. “You can’t afford an early season setback. We understand that, and we are really looking forward to this tournament.”
Following up a 2013 campaign in which he netted 79 goals, senior driver Kostas Genidounias will look to establish his goal-scoring presence again this weekend for the Trojans. Though heading a Trojan squad comprising more than half freshmen, the veteran Genidounias remains focused on establishing USC’s winning presence for 2014 at the invitational.
“Starting strong is always important, especially when we have so many new guys,” Genidounias said. “I’m really happy and proud about what we’ve been doing here with the team chemistry. We have a brand new team, and we have to show the other teams from the beginning that we’re not just here to play, we’re back to win.”
Last season, Pacific became only the third team in 25 years outside of Cal, Stanford, UCLA and USC to reach the NCAA final, finishing the year with a record of 23-5.
Davis, Redlands and La Verne come with 2013 records of 14-13, 19-14 and 7-23, respectively.
Opening against Davis Saturday, the Trojan defense will concentrate on Aggies utility man Chris Richardson. Richardson scored a team-high 49 goals last year.
Sunday’s game against the Tigers will feature many newcomers on both sides, including McQuin Baron for the Trojans and driver Chris Gardhouse for the Tigers. Both players were named First Team All-CIF as high school seniors last year.
Vavic said the Trojans’ first tournament of the year will be a big indicator of the team’s lineups going forward.
“Our goal [this weekend] is really to figure out our rotations,” Vavic said. “To me that’s the number one thing, to figure out who plays well with whom.”
Though he joins USC having previously competed for high school powerhouse Mater Dei and currently for the United States National Team, the 6-foot-9 Baron is not taking his first collegiate tournament for granted.
“First weekend tournament, I’d say it’s very important, honestly,” Baron said. “It sets the tempo for the rest of the year, and it shows us where we’re at and what we need to improve on. [My goal] is to play to the best of my abilities. I’m a new goalie, [USC has] had a lot of very, very strong goalies in the past, so I have a lot to live up to.”
Despite the changes to both teams since last December, Vavic feels his team is ready.
“When you are the returning national champion, you definitely feel much better about [the game] than the opponent,” Vavic said. “I think there’s a lot to prove for them, and this is going to be a game where they try to avenge that loss. For us, it’s really just another game.”

The USC football team faces its first true test of the season on Saturday when it heads to Palo Alto, California to take on the Stanford Cardinal.
The No. 14 Trojans (1-0) look to continue their hot start after a 52-13 drubbing of Fresno State last week. First-year head coach Steve Sarkisian’s new up-tempo offense worked to perfection against the Bulldogs, allowing USC to rack up 701 yards of total offense while running a Pac-12 record 105 plays.
Tough test · Senior linebacker Hayes Pullard said in practice that Stanford would be the toughest team USC would face all season. The team captain had 11 tackles against the Cardinal in last year’s 20-17 upset. – Ralf Cheung | Daily Trojan
No. 13 Stanford (1-0) saw similar success in its opening game, dispatching FCS opponent UC Davis 45-0. The Cardinal jumped on the board early, recording their first score on a 60-yard punt return from All-American kick returner Ty Montgomery. Montgomery, who is also the team’s top receiver, was a slight concern going into the game due to offseason surgery on his shoulder, but the senior appeared healthy as ever, also adding a 44-yard touchdown catch late in the second quarter. Head coach David Shaw emptied his bench for most of the second half after Stanford went into the break with a 38-0 lead, likely preventing an even bigger rout.
Though they made a strong opening statement, Shaw and the Cardinal’s biggest offseason question remains somewhat unanswered. Running back Tyler Gaffney gashed the USC defense for 158 yards and two scores last season, eventually finishing the year with 1,709 yards and a conference-leading 21 rushing touchdowns. With Gaffney now in the professional ranks, Stanford will have to rely on an unproven ballcarrier to drive its pro-style, run-heavy offense. Neither Barry J. Sanders nor Kelsey Young was particularly impressive in limited attempts against the Aggies, and both will likely see their workloads increase against USC.
Young will have his work cut out for him against a strong USC defensive front. The Trojans held Fresno State to a modest 157 yards on the ground behind stalwart efforts from senior linebacker Hayes Pullard and junior defensive end Leonard Williams, who combined for 16 total tackles. Still, Pullard knows the unit must tighten up to stop the Stanford attack.
“We definitely have the speed in one-on-ones,” Pullard said. “We just gotta be physically and mentally prepared. I’ve just been preparing, the defensive line, the secondary are just preparing.”
What Stanford lacks in experience at the running back position it makes up for in spades at quarterback. Senior signal-caller Kevin Hogan has led the Cardinal to back-to-back Pac-12 titles, acting as an efficient facilitator for a punishing rushing game. This season, without a premier runner, Shaw will have to lean heavily on his field general. Hogan looked sharp against the Aggies, completing 12 of 16 passes for 204 yards and three scores while playing behind an offensive line that featured four new starters.
Sarkisian acknowledged that this year’s Stanford offense could look different than the pure power running schemes of seasons past.
“When you look at their roster, they have three elite wide receivers in Montgomery, [Michael] Rector and [Devon] Cajuste,” Sarkisian said. “They have a pretty athletic quarterback that can run it as well as throw it. For us it’s about preparing for that and preparing for the power game as well.”
USC’s new-look offense should provide an early season challenge for a young Stanford defensive unit. Redshirt junior quarterback Cody Kessler spread the field last Saturday and successfully found a variety of weapons, including two-way freshmen Adoree’ Jackson and JuJu Smith.
Kessler will line up against a defense that looks far different from the one that stifled the Trojan offense for most of last year’s upset win. The Cardinal lost four first-team All-Pac-12 defenders to graduation, including linebacker Shayne Skov and safety Ed Reynolds. On the defensive line, first-team all-conference selection Ben Gardner and honorable mention pick Henry Anderson are also gone. In typical Stanford fashion, however, many of these players have been replaced by experienced upperclassmen instead of younger options. Junior Blake Martinez and returning starter A.J. Tarpley combined for 10 total tackles from the inside linebacker position against the Aggies, while junior linebacker Noor Davis added an interception. Sarkisian knows that breaking down this defense will be a much harder task than it was against the Bulldogs.
“They’ve got big, physical guys up front,” Sarkisian said. “They’ve got a good scheme. They’re well coached, they stop what you’re good at and they sack the quarterback.”
The last two seasons have seen each of these teams upset the other on home turf, and Jackson played up the intensity in this growing rivalry.
“It’s going to be a smashmouth football game,” Jackson said. “We’re just gonna have to come out and compete, and it’s not gonna be easy. It’s going to be a dogfight to the end.”
USC leads the all-time series 60-29 with three ties. Catch this year’s game at 12:30 p.m. on ABC.

There is danger in making political headlines sound more significant than they are. This week’s example comes from an article published by Slate that attempts to scare the living daylights out of Americans by criticizing a recent Supreme Court decision limiting the Fifth Amendment, which outlines, among other things, an American citizen’s right to not be compelled to testify against him or herself.
University of Virginia law professor Brandon Garrett disagreed with the Supreme Court’s limitation. In an article thunderously headlined, “You Don’t Have the Right to Remain Silent,” Garrett described the ruling as “terrible — and dangerous.”
Garrett is wrong. His article also demonstrates the problem of writing “click bait” headlines (flashy and provactive captions to elicit more traffic) about serious political issues.
The Supreme Court decided Salinas v. Texas last Monday. Here are the facts: Genovevo Salinas was charged with a double homicide in Texas in 1993. Before he was charged, he voluntarily agreed to answer questions at the Houston police department. During the questioning, Salinas provided an answer to every question until he was asked if his shotgun would match the bullet casings found at the crime scene.
He then became suspiciously quiet, and his demeanor changed. He was released briefly but charged with the murder several days later. By then, he had disappeared. He was arrested 14 years later in 2007, and his first trial was ruled a mistrial. During the second trial, the judge ruled that his refusal to answer the question in 1993 about the shotgun casings could be described to the jury and used as evidence against him. A ballistics report also proved that the bullets found at the scene did in fact match Salinas’ gun. He was then convicted and sentenced to 20 years in prison. Salinas appealed the conviction, arguing that the Fifth Amendment’s protection from testifying against oneself meant that the description of his behavior during the 1993 questioning shouldn’t have been discussed in court.
The Supreme Court disagreed in a 5-4 decision. Justice Alito wrote that any person being questioned must explicitly and verbally invoke the Fifth Amendment to be protected. A notable exception is that a defendant under coercion during questioning is given a reprieve from this requirement, but Salinas was never under coercion — he agreed to go to the station voluntarily. At trial, he submitted no evidence that the police coerced him during questioning.
Nevertheless, the crux of Professor Garrett’s argument in Slate on behalf of Salinas is that the Supreme Court’s limitation on the Fifth Amendment “encourages the kind of high-pressure questioning that can elicit false confessions.”
Salinas could have left the station at any time — in fact, he didn’t even have to agree to be questioned in the first place. Furthermore, if Salinas had evidence he was coerced, the decision likely would have been in his favor because of the coercion exception. Even Garrett admits later in his argument that police, to eliminate coercive interrogations, have begun videotaping the entire process — but he asserts that police will simply coerce a defendant before the camera starts rolling.
The way in which Garrett’s article is presented is also troubling. Blending serious political news with “click bait” headlines is dangerous, and the article is a textbook example. The headline, “You Don’t Have the Right to Remain Silent,” is absurd. Even worse, Garrett (and Slate) were so caught up in generating hits that they forgot about what their most important mission should be: helping future criminal defendants understand how their rights have changed, and how they can avoid being in the same unfortunate situation as Salinas. Instead, Slate oddly titled the article so as to apparently convince readers that the Fifth Amendment doesn’t exist anymore.
They should have devoted some time to informing readers of how their Fifth Amendment rights have changed. Put simply, during any interrogation, the ruling means that you must explicitly and verbally invoke your Fifth Amendment rights during any interrogation by the police. It might also do well to decline a voluntary visit to the police station if you know your shotgun is going to match the bullets found at the murder scene.

It’s safe to assume that pretty much anybody reading this article will interpret the combination of a colon and closed parenthesis as a “smiley” face. Created in 1963 by American advertising man Harvey Ball, the “smiley” face entered the world of typography in 1982 as an iconic yellow circle with two black eyes and a perfectly round smile.
Lili Scarlet Sedano | Daily Trojan
Now, the evolution of the happy face has progressed one step further with Emojli — the world’s first emoji-only social network that is slated to go viral. The wordless social network is now available on iOS.
While the concept of Emojli is simple and novel enough, the idea is wrought with complex negative implications. The trailer video states, “Now, we know what you’re thinking. This is satire. No one would actually make this thing. It’s not, and we have.” The very fact that the creators needed to clarify this points at the red flags the novel app raises. In a culture where people are taught from a young age to “use their words” and essay writing is a core component of primary education, this concept is definitely unconventional.
In this technological age, the birth of a platform such as Emojli seems all but inevitable, but there appears to be little to gain for the average texter. Though emoji, the pictorial language of emoticons and simple graphics, has gained incredible momentum in recent years, its practicality is limited. It’s true that emojis provide users with the ability to personalize technology, infusing black-and-white typography with a little zest, but this personalization has a price. According to Luke Stark and Kate Crawford’s essay “The Conservatism of Emoji,” corporations such as Facebook have already capitalized on this phenomenon, utilizing emoji for data tracking.
As Stark and Crawford pointed out, emoji homogenizes written expression by limiting the user to a finite selection of images. In providing emojis representing only a handful of items or types of people, the creators have inadvertently promoted and normalized a limited amount of behaviors and lifestyles. For example, on the current iOS platform, there is a distinct lack of diversity among the emojis representing human beings. For one, almost all of the female emojis wear pink.
Moreover, emoji undermines the flexibility of the written word. Sending a small graphic image can be the easiest way to convey tone, but emoji-speak can only be so personal. Instead of inserting a sparkling pink heart at the end of a message, someone messaging a loved one should actually convey their feelings using a phrase of their choice. Anyone can send their love interest a kissing smiley face, but every person uses written language in a unique way. In this manner, communicating in emoji is like piecing together a collage of someone else’s images rather than creating something completely original.
Even if emoji is harmless, there remains one gaping hole in the argument for Emojli. As unique a concept as Emojli might be, it might very well prove to be utterly useless. Business and technology news websites, including Wired and Business Insider, are drawing comparisons between Emojli and Yo, which allows users to tap a friend’s name and cause the friend’s phone to exclaim, “Yo!” Despite its apparent pointlessness, “Yo” made headlines when investors pledged $1.2 million toward the app’s development. All the while, downloads skyrocketed, setting the stage for future apps with similar aesthetic and novelty appeal. Even if Emojli receives similar attention and becomes a fad in its own right, it may prove to be just that, a fad that comes and goes, leaving no significant impact on written language.
Fad or phenomenon, good or bad, the effect of emojis and programs such as Emojli are certainly worth mentioning. Despite their inhibiting nature, emojis are on the rise. Its popularity lies in a subconscious desire for simplicity in an age of information overload, or perhaps it is just a side effect of a technology addiction, taking its roots in a need for instant creative gratification. A drawing can take hours, but an emoji creation only takes minutes, maybe seconds. Whether or not this growing language is something to humanize machines or mechanize humans, it is more important than ever that members of the technological age find the time to break free from the world of screens and symbols to decide which brands of social interaction are truly worthwhile.

Frederick J. Ryan Jr., who graduated from the USC Gould School of Law in 1980, will be the next publisher of the Washington Post newspaper. Ryan, formerly president of Allbritton Communications Company and co-founder of the online news source Politico, replaces Katharine Weymouth, whose family has owned the Washington Post for more than 80 years.
“I am honored to follow four generations of Graham family leadership and thrilled with the opportunity to work with Jeff [Bezos] and the incredibly talented team at The Post,” Ryan told USC Gould News.
Ryan’s new role as publisher comes after Amazon.com founder Jeff Bezos bought the Washington Post in August 2013.
“Fred has had a truly remarkable career, in both public service and the private sector,” Gould Dean Robert K. Rasmussen told Gould News. “Talented lawyers are essential to our democracy, as is a free and robust press. I am confident that with Fred at the helm, one of our nation’s great newspapers will get even better.”
After graduating from law school, Ryan worked in the West Wing of former U.S. President Ronald Reagan’s White House. In 1988, he moved back to California to serve as Reagan’s chief of staff after the former president left office in 1989, helping to establish the Ronald Reagan Presidential Foundation and Library.
He returned to Washington, D.C. in 1995 to head Allbritton Communications Company, and later helped establish the Politico news organization in 2007.
“I’ve always had an interest in communications,” Ryan told USC Gould News. “I dealt a lot with the media in the White House. It’s not so different being on the other side. The same way a candidate is seeking to get a message out, we’re seeking readers of our newspaper and website, and trying to establish our brand. We aren’t as far apart as most people would think.”

The recently acquired Dennis Hopper exhibit, “Part of Being an Artist: The Dennis Hopper Collection, Selected Artwork and Ephemera”, opened at the School of Cinematic Arts on Tuesday. The exhibit is currently open exclusively to USC students, faculty and staff, but will be open to the public Oct. 10 through Nov. 26.
The exhibit contains photographs, scripts and other memorabilia commemorating Hopper’s work as an actor, director and photographer. The main features of the exhibit are two large photographs of Andy Warhol and his work from Hopper’s collection, “The Lost Album”. Also on display is the Louisville Slugger baseball bat that was made personally for Hopper.
The photographs on display were taken between 1961 and 1967 during Hopper’s most prolific period. Steve Hanson, head librarian of the Cinematic Arts Library, is a co-curator of the exhibit. Hanson said the Hopper exhibit has “a touch of everything.”
“He took photos of everything. That was his thing,” he said.
Hopper’s life is documented through his work in both the film and music industries. According to Hanson, Hopper’s career as a director began based on the advice of James Dean. Dean, Paul Newman and John Wayne were all friends of Hopper and can be seen in some of the photographs on display.
“The circle of friends he had was amazing, from all walks of life,” Hanson said.
The Hopper exhibit was acquired by USC from the Hopper Art Trust, which distributes the artist’s work throughout the world. Initially, the collection started with various movie scripts, VHS tapes and books. It has grown to its current size with the help of Hopper’s daughter, Marin, and Steve Hanson’s co-curators, Taylor Livingston and Sandra Garcia-Meyers.
“It’s sort of like a family thing. Anything that someone donates to us, we work with,” Hanson said.
Pieces of Hopper’s collections have previously been on display in the Gagosian Gallery in New York and the Museo Picasso in Málaga, Spain. This is the first time a Hopper collection has been on display in Los Angeles since 2010.
SCA is working in collaboration with Visions and Voices to honor Dennis Hopper. Easy Rider, a film Hopper both directed and acted in, will be screened on Sept. 12 at 7 p.m. by Visions and Voices, which will also be showing another Hopper film, The Last Movie, on Nov. 14. After the screenings, panel discussions with some of Hopper’s colleagues will be held.
In March 2010, Dennis Hopper was honored with a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. He passed away two months later in Venice, California, after a 55-year career in the film industry.

E-cigarettes produce second-hand smoke that is less harmful than that of traditional cigarettes with respect to the carcinogenic substances, but they contain higher quantities of toxic metals, according to a recent study by USC professors published in the Journal of Environmental Science, Processes and Impacts.
Killers · Despite being less carcinogenic than traditional cigarettes, e-cigarettes contain higher levels of the toxic metals chromium and nickel. – Samuel Chang | Daily Trojan
“Our results demonstrate that overall electronic cigarettes seem to be less harmful than regular cigarettes, but their elevated content of toxic metals such as nickel and chromium do raise concerns,” Costas Sioutas, professor at the Viterbi School of Engineering and corresponding author of the study said in a press release.
In traditional cigarettes, the carcinogenic smoke is due primarily to the tobacco leaves used. E-cigarettes, however, are comprised mainly of nicotine cartridges and a special battery with an electronic circuit. They do not have any organic substances like tobacco and hence do not produce the cancer-causing smoke, like traditional cigarettes do.
But the research also uncovered that e-cigarettes contain the toxic metals chromium and nickel at higher levels than traditional cigarettes.
“In an e-cigarette, the container that carries the nicotine liquid is usually made of metals and this metal alloy used for manufacturing might most likely be the source for the toxic substances in the smoke,” said Arian Saffari, a Ph.D. student at Viterbi and lead author of the paper.
The research, funded by the National Institute of Cancer Research in Milan, Italy, went on for about eight months and involved field sampling, air and chemical analysis and mathematical modulations. The researchers felt the study was very challenging since it was an interdisciplinary activity involving both mathematics and chemistry. The samples tested were from real-life environments like offices and rooms to simulate actual conditions unlike the laboratories, making the results very reliable.
Regulation of e-cigarettes has been a controversial issue, but e-cigarettes are still a less harmful alternative for those struggling to quit traditional cigarettes. Even public places like cafés and hospitals do not prohibit their usage within their premises. Saffari feels that this research could be helpful in prompting some regulatory modifications that would benefit passive smokers. Though the e-cigarettes are less harmful than traditional ones, the research shows they are not harmless and aims to create an awareness regarding the usage of e-cigarettes in public places.
“We felt a huge gap of knowledge between what needs to be known before putting some regulations and what we know now, since [e-cigarettes] are quite new,” Saffari said.
Many students believe that e-cigarettes should not be regulated to the same extent as traditional cigarettes.
“I think e-cigarettes shouldn’t be [regulated] as strictly as regular cigarettes because research has shown it’s definitely not as bad,” Kevin Wang, a senior majoring in business administration said. “There should be some regulation like [how] most restaurants have smoking and non-smoking [areas], but the regulation shouldn’t be to the extent of normal cigarettes.”
Others said the government should allow e-cigarettes but should also implement programs to discourage their use.
“I don’t think they should be regulated as much as normal cigarettes because they’re not really harming other people, so you kind of have your free will to do whatever you want,” Swini Tummala, a junior majoring in international relations, said. “But I certainly think that with taxes and stuff, we put social pressure on people not to smoke or not to drink as much so I think that’s one way the government could maybe put pressure and do some social engineering to where it’s not as attractive to use e-cigarettes.”
 
Certainly people have the right and freedom to smoke (e-cigarettes or regular) however non-smokers have the right to work, eat, and socialize in public spaces free of tobacco smoke or vapor from e-cigarettes. The non-smoker’s/vapor’s right to a smoke/vape free environment does not impinge upon that of smokers and vapors. Smoke or Vape all you want in your residence, or designated areas away from non-smokers/vapors, but keep it out of my face. Your addiction is not my problem.
amazing how some people welcome social engineering by the government against something that will help smokers quit smoking. Have these students lost their use of research in seeking the truth and freedom.
Stop blowing smoke WHO….. your own researchers say the contaminates do not indicate a health hazard.
I always thought convincing evidence was all the emission studies
done. Environmental researcher Igor Burstyn read through all of them and
 cleaned up the ones where the researchers measured their own underarm
deodorant. He concluded in his review of over 9000 data points that
e-cigarettes present no health risk to the user and none to a bystander.
 They emit less than 4% of the universally accepted workplace safety
thresholds for VOCs. USC released a paper on one e-cigarette and found
the metals released in the vapor were even lower. When one looks at the
same VOCs only from a human breath, it takes 15 puffs on an e-cigarette
to match the acetaldehyde in ONE human breath.
In the meantime, both the American Heart Association and the American
 Cancer Association recognize e-cigarettes are safe. And why not. All
the individual ingredients have been studied for decades and found safe
by every regulatory body that has had to make a safety determination,
which includes the FDA, EPA and OSHA. The chemicals are very well
profiled. We need the standard consumer ‘Good Manufacturing Practices’
regulations that every industry has. We don’t need some weird WHO
created moralistic regulations. E-liquid is not tobacco.

Dr. Carol Atkinson, professor of international relations at USC and a veteran of the United States Air Force, gave an hour-long briefing to USC students at the Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism about U.S. military tactics on Wednesday afternoon.
Power move · Atkinson believes the changing landscape of foreign policy necessitates an emphasis on developing soft military power. – Carol Kim | Daily Trojan
Atkinson, who served in Operation Desert Storm, spoke on the shift of the U.S. military’s approach from hard tactics to soft, due to what she described as a changing tide of foreign policy and a new era in public diplomacy.
When Atkinson initially studied the nature of soft power, or using the relationships and collaborative nature of military educational exchange programs to build public diplomacy, she was met with opposition.
“Studying soft power is all the rage [now], but that wasn’t always the case,” Atkinson said. “The stereotype is that the U.S. Military teaches its soldiers to repress.”
Atkinson’s 10-year research project was mostly based on the War and Staff Colleges in the U.S., which house U.S. military students and offer grants to international students or give foreign countries the opportunity to “buy slots” for their citizens.
Currently, about 140 countries send their military personnel to these American military colleges, which traditionally host students over a two year period. Residents often bring their families and thoroughly integrate themselves into American culture.
“They form a cohesive group and form very close friendships,” Atkinson said. “It’s a social gathering as well.”
Atkinson surveyed international students at the military colleges about their experiences in the United States and their relationships with U.S. citizens, asking them a variety of questions such as what region they came from, whether they belong to a democratic or undemocratic country, what their most positive experience was in the United States, what they feel the United States can improve upon and how much time they spend off-duty with U.S. citizens.
Her studies found that the international students responded very positively to having their families in the United States with them. Atkinson refers to the impact of families on military officers as “underestimated and under-studied.”
She spoke from personal experience, having served overseas without her husband.
“It’s nice to have someone in your family there with you … [Y]ou’re not alone in dealing with [problems],” Atkinson said. “[I]t enhances the cultural experience.”
Atkinson said that Disney World was the most popular answer when she asked students about their favorite cultural and travel experience in the United States.
“Where is that anti-American culture?” she asked the audience.
Atkinson said the programs help improve the image of the United States.
“Most come away with positive impressions,” Atkinson said.  “It’s not just the country. It’s an international web of people educated in the United States.”
Students said the seminar highlighted the shifts in U.S. foreign policy.
“The findings from this seminar show that this soft power … has shifted from the military, power influence to the cultural influence,” said Danwei Wu, a first-year graduate student studying communication management.
All of Atkinson’s research and studies can be found in her book Military Soft Power: Public Diplomacy through Military Educational Exchanges, which was released in June.
“I think the bottom line of my presentation here is that the U.S. military is often thought of in a sense of coercion and fighting wars,” Atkinson said.  “But we are also interested in how the military extends its influence through soft power, through building relationships, building partnerships with other militaries around the world and I hope my study here helps contribute to a better understanding of this.”
