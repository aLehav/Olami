When she was in the fifth grade, Celeste Butler said she could feel it already — although she was cast as “Indian Number Four” and had no lines, when the choreography brought her to the front of the stage she thought to herself: “This is my calling.” Butler, a 2019 USC graduate, recounted her “breakout” moment in a youth theatre production of “Peter Pan” lightheartedly, attributing the not-so-super-star moment as the start of her foray into musical performance.
Now, audiences worldwide can see Butler experience another on-stage breakout moment, this time with the classic blue “American Idol” logo in the background. In the trailer for the show’s season four premiere, Butler appears belting in a bright purple outfit, with silver heart earrings rather on brand for the love-abundant way she carries herself as an entertainer, advocate and entrepreneur. 
“She’s the kind of person who will bring positive energy to a room and that shows not only in her work ethic but  in her performance,” said Ron McCurdy, professor at the Thornton School of Music and lifelong mentor to Butler. “I’m so proud of what she’s done and what she’s doing right now. I think we’ll be going to her shows and buying her CDs and watching her on television a lot here in the coming years, I’m sure.”
At just 24 years old, Butler’s resume reads like someone who has already lived a seasoned career. She has performed at the Hollywood Bowl and sung alongside renowned artists such as Diana Ross and Chaka Khan. She has produced a multimedia stage show that debuted at the GRAMMY Museum, acted in an award-winning short film and founded her own multi-branch entertainment company called Creation Against Barriers.
Throughout all of her work, themes of social justice and love are apparent — such as in a single she released with recording artist and producer Jacob Martin, following the police killing of George Floyd. Layered on top of steady funk beats, a gospel-esque backtrack and jazzy instrumentals, Butler repeats the refrain “no justice, no peace / no racist police.” She wanted to create a song that people could listen to while fighting for racial justice, whether that be while marching in a protest or donating to the cause, she said.
“I do talk a lot about social justice issues or community or identity,” Butler said. “At the end of the day, I do want it to be a source of love, as opposed to something that I’m putting out to be divisive or add fuel to the fire. I’d rather it be something that opens the door for conversations to be had, to increase understanding.”
Butler’s passion for music and creating art imbued with advocacy goes way back to her roots, she said. Namely, her faith, her family and her experiences and mentorship found at Thornton, where she received both her bachelor’s in popular music performance and her master’s in arts leadership. 
The youngest in a musical, faith-based household
The youngest of three children, Butler grew up in Oceanside, San Diego, in a musical, military and Christian household. Kathryn Butler, Celeste’s mother, said growing up in this type of household helped further foster Celeste’s naturally kind and caring personality. Values of love and respect for everyone were central to the raising of Celeste and her two siblings, who are also musicians. 
“She’s always been happy, loving, kind — even from a small child,” Kathryn said.“She’s always been this way. But of course, as parents, we nurture those gifts … the love and the radiance that you see in her, that’s the type of atmosphere she grew up in. That’s the type of atmosphere she lives in now.”
From a young age, Butler’s atmosphere has overflowed with music — whether that be at home or at church, where she sang in choirs, praise teams and ensembles. She said having both her church and theater experiences as foundational music moments helped her realize how powerful music is. 
“In church, music is like this healing agent,” Butler said. “Although we’re having our individual moment with Christ through music, it’s something that we’re all partaking in. And I feel like that translated when I got on stage [for ‘Peter Pan’] … you’re still a piece of this bigger picture, and then looking out and seeing the audience … it’s something that we’re all connected to together.”
Most of her early exposure to music was faith-based, but Butler said she remembers a moment at a birthday party when she heard the song “Ain’t Nobody” by Chaka Khan playing, and it “literally” changed her life. 
Years later, she would sing for Khan at a Thornton master’s class, but back at that birthday party she wondered, “Why has nobody told me that this exists?”
“I was very offended, but it’s okay because we rectified the situation,” she said, joking. 
Butler’s professional career with music began when she was 16 and joined a girl group that performed live, created music videos and competed on “X Factor.” Then, at 17, she applied to just one school, deciding that if it was meant to be it was meant to be. 
That’s when she found herself at Thornton as a popular music performance student. 
Navigating USC and Gateway practice rooms 
There are a lot of places Butler associates with her time at USC. There’s the Ronald Tutor Campus Center Ballroom and the basketball court outside of Cardinal Gardens, both places she performed with her band. There’s the Gateway practice rooms where she spent “hours, hours, hours” rehearsing and writing songs, such as “Prey Up, America” — which she wrote after finding out Trump had won the 2016 election. 
“I feel like I should have a room named after me in there one day,” Butler said, laughing about how much time she spent practicing. “I will fund the room.”
But what Butler associates more with her time at USC are the mentors she met and still holds close to this day, such as McCurdy and Patrice Rushen — an award-winning musician and composer, the first woman musical director of the Grammy Awards and Emmy Awards and the chair of the popular music program at Thornton. 
When Butler met Rushen, she was auditioning for the pop music program. Rushen said she was immediately impressed with how Butler possessed all of the qualities she looked for in a candidate. The selective pop music program only accepts 25-30 students each year, Rushen said. 
“That idea of great intellect, great spirit, great talent, drive and curiosity — she seemed to have all of those things in place, always did,” Rushen said. “From her freshman days right up through graduation and post-grad, she continues to be that kind of person and has really grown into an artist who has many capabilities.”
When Butler started school, she said she was the only Black woman in the pop music program, so she looked to Rushen for guidance. Rushen, as a leading Black woman in a predominantly white industry, was no stranger to navigating that arena, she said. 
“Being the only Black student and a woman in the department for a number of years, I know that she leaned into me being there, and I tried to use the experiences that I have had to offer ways in which [she could] find [her] way,” Rushen said. “I’m glad I had that kind of influence on her as she did me, because, you know, I had my days too.”
In the class “The Music of Black Americans,” Butler met McCurdy, the former chair of the Thornton jazz department who she described as a “walking encyclopedia.” Later on, in 2019, while getting her master’s degree in arts leadership at Thornton, he would invite her to produce his multimedia stage show “Harlem South: A View Through the Lens,” but at the time, he was another mentor who made her undergraduate experience memorable. 
“She was one of those students who was very dutiful, did her work, excelled in the class, very personable,” McCurdy said. “It was a historical class that dealt with not only just the music but also social, political, economic, religious variables as well. And as you might imagine we had some very spirited discussions at which she was always very happy to partake in.”
Overall, Butler said her time at Thornton helped her look at music more holistically. Prior to coming to USC, she said she had only looked at music as a performer, songwriter and singer; through her undergraduate and graduate studies, she began to see how marketing, composing and musical directing were all aspects as well, she said. 
“Having those different classes just opened my eyes to what could be,” Butler said. “That is the point in which I was like ‘OK, I’m taking it from this viewpoint and this angle, and it’s becoming much more expansive and I can see how many more people I would be able to impact with a message in my music, in these different spaces.’”
The next chapter: pursuing art in different spaces
Butler went to USC planning on making a career out of music. While she has done just that (just look for her released music or watch her on “American Idol” on Feb. 14), she has also found more spaces than singing to share a message through art.
Take Creation Against Barriers as an example. CAB, an entertainment company that provides creative and administrative services in music, fashion and events, was born during Butler’s time at USC, but it truly came to life in 2020 amid the pandemic, she said. 
“It’s really about creating a space and a platform for people who believe in social change and believe in social harmony, to come together and to be creative and to have that impact that they want,” she said. 
Along with using the time for CAB, Butler said she worked on an initiative called the Sugarhill Arts Revival Project. The project, in partnership with the California Arts Council and the School of Dramatic Arts at USC, pays homage to African American trailblazers of the Sugar Hill district in Los Angeles during the 1940s and 1950s and engages with and highlights current musicians and artists in the community. 
Butler has also partnered up with Jae Deal, an award-winning producer and professor of music production at USC, to share messages of unity, equity and love through Use Your Voice Global Collaboration. Deal, who founded the project, said it was founded to highlight the support of non-Americans for Black and Indigenous people and people of color, using music as a tool for advocacy.  
While the project was Deal’s vision, he said he realized that Butler would be the perfect leader and asked her to be the executive director of the project. 
“Celeste Butler is hard to put into words,” Deal said. “She’s one of the most amazing people I’ve met in my entire life, and I don’t use that term lightly … She’s a joy to work with and a great team player. She makes everyone around her better. I wanted to envision what the collective would do. It just hit me that Celeste is the perfect candidate to be the leader to take us into the future.”
For Butler’s own future, she said she’s ready to focus on recording her own music — as she pursues a funk, disco and soul “feel good” sound — and spend more time working with community arts and youth organizations. Ultimately, she describes herself as “message-based,” driven by purpose, advocacy and her faith. 
“I’m proud of her singing, I’m proud of her academics, I’m proud of all the things that she’s done,” Kathryn said. “But I’m most proud that she stands firm on her beliefs, no matter what it is. She is going to be who she is, based on that foundational principle, and that’s what I’m most proud of.”

Nancy Liu remembers reading “The Joy Luck Club” by Amy Tan for the first time in high school. For Liu, the book, which depicts the experiences of four Chinese American immigrant families in San Francisco, was the first work written by an Asian author that she had read, and the first that allowed her to read about her parents’ Chinese culture. 
“I grew up here, so it’s kind of hard because I don’t have as much of a connection to China and my parents’ childhoods and their culture growing up,” Liu said. “Reading about other people’s experiences with [Chinese culture] is really cool and really special.” 
When Liu came to USC, she felt like something was missing: a space for Asian Pacific Islander Desi American creators to showcase their talents and connect through shared experiences.
Liu, a junior majoring in public relations, pitched the idea of curating a platform for APIDA-focused content to some of her fellow APIDA creators, and many showed interest in collaborating with her. She recruited the first nine executive board members to kickstart Descent Magazine, USC’s premiere student-run APIDA arts magazine. 
“We’re the first APIDA arts magazine, so we’re trying to tell stories that specifically the APIDA population at USC can relate to, but that can also show other people at USC the different talents of APIDA creators and the depth of the things we can create,” Liu said. “Not everything is like ‘Crazy Rich Asians’ or ‘Bling Empire,’ but we also have more personal stories to tell.”
Launched this spring, Descent Magazine is a space for APIDA creators to share their experiences through artwork, such as photography, film and poetry. The magazine seeks to amplify APIDA voices and create a platform for APIDA creators at USC to display a diversity of artwork, stories and talents.
Liu serves as the director of writing and co-editor in chief of Descent. Outside of spearheading the APIDA arts magazine, Liu works as the digital editor for Palaver, another student-run online arts magazine. Working with Palaver and taking a special topics course called “Journalism for Mobile and Emerging Platforms” taught her the fundamentals of zine-making and gave her the confidence to launch Descent Magazine.
Last month, Descent announced the debut issue’s theme: “Liminal Spaces,” which features artwork that emerges from the people existing in them. The organization described liminal spaces as “the moment of transition from one reality and story to another.”
Long Le, a junior majoring in cinema and media studies, is Descent’s other co-editor in chief, as well as the multimedia and photography director. Le said the vagueness of the theme gives artists endless opportunities to create something meaningful to them.
“For Descent, it’s our first semester and currently we’re in this liminal space of becoming a magazine, making our first issue and hopefully becoming something greater just in general,” Le said.
Steven Gong, a junior majoring in public relations, is the director of web production for Descent. Gong said that he quickly connected to Descent after recognizing its unique emphasis on APIDA artists and their work. 
“I think a lot of Asian Americans grew up kind of distancing themselves with their Asian heritage,” Gong said. “It’s harder for them to really see Asian art as ‘cool’ or even see role models anywhere that are Asian. I feel like this is a really good opportunity to showcase talent that you would see in popular culture or everywhere around you, but it’s art that comes from a place of heritage and culture.”
The organization has planned open mic nights where interested artists can pitch their ideas and receive feedback before the submission deadline. Le said the event’s purpose is to create an inclusive environment where artists and the executive board can collaborate and finetune ideas to fit the issue’s theme.
“Our goal isn’t to weed out people — it’s more to bring people in,” Le said. “We really want to make sure that people feel welcomed to submit their ideas … so the pitch night is a way for people to introduce those ideas and then we can give them feedback on how to better formulate it into our theme.”
While the executive board members are working on completing the magazine’s first issue before its tentative publication in April, Gong said the organization also wants to build a community for APIDA artists and those interested in APIDA art. 
“Everyone at Descent is really passionate about building a community and, more than a community, a legacy that will stay at USC beyond our time here,” Gong said. 
For community building, Le said Descent also created an open Discord server to hold game nights and social events, and for members to gather and talk to one another. The server also includes bots that give users writing sprints, art prompts and challenges. 
“Sometimes there’s just not a really great space for people to share stuff,” Le said. “I think some people can get really nervous about things that they want to share and express about themselves, and so we kind of want to be a safe space for them.”
Descent eventually hopes to expand their zine beyond USC, by featuring and reaching other artists and individuals throughout the broader Los Angeles area or on other university campuses.
“[The magazine] helps show a different side of us and all the different sides that are within the APIDA community because even though we call ourselves ‘the APIDA community,’ there are so many different subgroups,” Liu said. “Art really helps to connect people and to show them all these different things about themselves.”

To address health inequities both locally in Los Angeles, as well as globally, Sana Shah founded the USC chapter of Blueprints for Pangaea in November with a mission to reallocate unused medical supplies from local hospitals to communities in need.
Blueprints for Pangaea is a national organization founded in 2013 and headquartered at the University of Michigan. The organization has expanded to eight universities across the United States, with the new USC chapter being the first on the West Coast.
Shah, a transfer student from the University of Michigan and a member of their Blueprints for Pangaea chapter, knew that she wanted to bring the organization with her to USC.
“I’m really passionate about two big things: health equity and sustainability,” said Shah, a junior majoring in health promotion and disease prevention. “I think Blueprints for Pangaea addresses healthcare from an environmental perspective. Not only are we working to bring supplies and resources to people who need it, but we’re also getting waste out of landfills.”
While Blueprints for Pangaea has always been committed to health equity, their work is even more critical during the coronavirus pandemic, Shah said. 
“The national chapter has donated personal protective equipment (PPE) to various clinics,” Shah said. “A lot of people are severely lacking things that we might get whether it’s gloves or face masks.”
While the USC chapter started with Shah, she is now joined by 14 other passionate student leaders. Together, they are building partnerships with hospitals and nonprofits across L.A. and the greater Southern California region. 
One of their non-profit partners, Rolling with Me, is based in San Diego and delivers medical supplies and equipment to communities in Tijuana and Rosarito, Mexico. Another partner organization, Not Just Tourists, works with individual travelers to deliver medical supplies to clinics around the world while they go on vacation. 
Nick Wong will serve as director of human resources, where he will help continue to build partnerships with organizations across L.A. and facilitate relationships between new members of the organization.
“My goal is to make sure that the foundation is strong so that members feel like this is an organization that they can be a part of in the long run and have a lasting effect on the community,” Wong said.
The Blueprints for Pangaea headquarters continues to support and guide the USC chapter. Mariam Tobia, the University of Michigan expansion manager, has worked closely with Shah in setting up the new chapter and recruiting members to join.
“The potential that USC has is truly phenomenal,” Tobia said, “When I was sitting down [for interviews], I was just mind blown by how much experience and how much passion the interviewees were bringing. That got me really excited to see what more we could do when we have a finalized group of leadership.” 
Although the USC chapter will be the first on the West Coast, they will hopefully not be the last. Blueprints for Pangaea hopes to continue expanding to other universities on the West Coast; however, there are many challenges that come with starting chapters in this area, mainly because it is more expensive, Shah said.
“One thing I’m really excited about … is being able to help other West Coast chapters grow,” Shah said. “On the West Coast, it’s going to be a lot harder, realistically, just because of the price of storing supplies. I would love to help support other LA-based chapters.”
After Blueprints for Pangaea receives supplies from hospitals, they need a place to store them until they are able to distribute them to their partner nonprofits. The organization is hoping to secure funding for storage units in L.A., Shah said.
“I think the first step I want to take with this USC Chapter is to ensure that we have enough funding to keep it going,” Tobia said. “It can be a tough market if we have to buy a storage unit or anything like that. It can get pretty pricey. Now, we’re looking at ways to fundraise. I think that’s really going to help us in the future.”
In addition to financial support, Blueprints for Pangaea also relies on the support of dedicated student volunteers. While the new chapter hasn’t started receiving shipments of medical supplies yet, they hope that the USC community will be able to come together to help them once they do.
“When we are back in-person, there are going to be a lot of opportunities to volunteer with us,” Shah said. “Executing a shipment is not easy. We always need a lot of people on hand to help us inventory the supplies and measure our impact.”

Mental illness is often thought of as a biological disorder. This idea is reflected in the range of medication aimed at curing it by elevating or suppressing certain neurotransmitters. However, users remain uncured, and the mental health crisis continues to grow. 
If mental illness is purely biological, then why doesn’t medication cure the affliction?
Most mental illnesses, such as depression and bipolar disorder, all seem to have a common denominator: stress. In addition to certain genetic dispositions, mental illness is caused by changes within the brain during periods of high stress.
Compared to war-torn or unstable states, there seem to be fewer threats to one’s safety in so-called “first world countries.” Despite the physical security of such citizens, mental illness seems to be egalitarian, affecting those with the highest income as well as those who are financially insecure. 
One likely factor behind the stress is anxiety.
Irish psychiatrist Peadar O’Grady defines anxiety as a threat that is not immediate or unclear, but is fear by another name. According to O’Grady, the threat behind anxiety is the fear of losing one’s autonomy over their personal destiny. The fear behind mental illnesses is fearing the  inability to self-actualize and an inability to express human drives, programmed deep within our psyches. 
It is difficult to imagine that the feeling of lack of agency is caused by some genetic malfunction, and anxiety, as well as the diseases which it causes, is too widespread to be attributed to individual attributes. The only plausible culprit is the relationships people hold in and with society. The main causes for mental illnesses are not exclusively biological, but also social, and our society’s oversight of the roots of such afflictions contribute to the ongoing mental health crisis.
The social vectors of mental illness are largely ignored within the discussion of mental illness as well as the response to it. Genomic theories of mental health can provide insights into a minority of cases of mental illness — and non-biological causes, i.e. trauma, are understood to be the causes of disorders such as PTSD. However, they are ill-equipped to explain psychiatric afflictions such as anxiety and depression. 
Mental illness itself is a capitalist construct, as is its perceived binary opposite, “wellness.” The “well” person is well enough to go to work and function in society — that is, contribute to the economy through “acceptable” levels of consumption. The “ill” person is the one who cannot, and therefore must be cured.
The false dichotomy of “well” and “ill” is incredibly destructive when wellness is conceived as the status quo; it invents illness as a temporary. On top of the shortcomings of palliatives, such as Zoloft and beta-blockers, which aim to provide short term “wellness” through elevating or suppressing certain neurotransmitters, this perception of illness is largely responsible for the stigma deterring people from seeking care. 
The medicalization of mental illness could be argued as a net positive, due to an international movement of academics and public health workers who are working to destigmatize and raise awareness about the severity of the mental health crisis. However, the movement fails to ask the necessary questions: Why are people physically and emotionally isolated? Why do we feel such lack of control over our own destinies? Which structures in society give rise to these conditions? 
As modern life’s social problems are not recognized, the movement addresses mental health with palliative drugs, designed to temporarily ensure mental stability, rather than work towards a permanent cure.

When the Obama administration first relocated to the White House, the First Lady infamously replaced the mound of buttery croissants and Danish pastries that used to be found on the Oval Office table with the more salubrious apples. When the Trump team migrated, they decided to install the big red “Coke” button onto his desk, which, with a single tap, dispatches a butler armed with a chilled Coca-Cola can. 
Although this subtle change in foodstuffs may have been due to their respective “personal food preferences,” the implications — especially on over-stressed time-pressed college students who yearn for an acceptable quick meal — are dramatic. Ultimately, the Trump team’s open eagerness for the “All-American palate” inevitably led to the destigmatization of junk food, contributing to the obesity epidemic that plagues colleges across the nation.
It is not enough to declare former president Donald Trump to be pro-fast food solely on his “Coke” button. Yet, some of the legislation he has passed indicates a definite bias to protect fast food joints. 
For example, the Trump administration issued a federal rule that protected the fast food behemoths from employee lawsuits in March 2020. This new regulation means that if disgruntled employees want to sue, they will have to do so with both the mega-corporation (e.g. In-N-Out) and the franchisee store they worked in (e.g. the In-N-Out at LAX). Trump’s administration argued that this was enacted to “address regulations that hinder the American economy.” Yet, the fact that this particular regulation focuses only on fast food restaurants and not any other large U.S. franchise points towards a pro-fast food policy perspective. 
Furthermore, when first picking out his cabinet, Trump attempted to choose Andrew Puzder, the fast food titan who runs firms like Hardee’s and Carl’s Jr., as labor secretary. Though this was eventually overturned, the decision again exposed Trump’s clear affinity for the junk food universe. But, how does this stance affect the general population, aside from the petulant workers?
The blatant fervor for fast food displayed by top politicians, who are arguably our role models, has normalised this unhealthy meal choice for the general public in the United States. Let’s look back to Jan. 15, 2019, when the college football champions, the Clemson Tigers, visited the White House for the traditional celebratory dinner. Trump decided these top-notch athletes deserved towering piles of Big Macs, Whoppers and curly fries; the most worthy meal Trump could think to serve was a fast food banquet. 
To Americans, a third of whom are already obese, this shows the upper echelons of leadership explicitly picking fast food. Arguably, this makes McDonald’s seem more acceptable as a meal choice, because these proposed idols are publicly gorging themselves on doughnuts and Coca-Cola. Moreover, even if Trump is not considered a good role model, there will still be some subconscious normalisation of junk food as a result of such a public information campaign.
This becomes even more dangerous when it comes to the crowds of stressed college students. According to the New York University “Live Well NYU” program, 59.9% of college students are “more stressed out than ever before.” When balancing their academic workloads, extracurricular pursuits and social lives, it is inevitable that something must be sacrificed — often, food. Hence, when the sleep-deprived college student who needs a quick meal turns on Fox and sees a fast food feast at the White House, Burger King becomes a slightly more acceptable dinner option. In fact, over 70% of college students eat fast food at least once a day.
Thus, this fast food mindset is ingrained in the minds of many Americans. As Trump and his minions tout junk food as “[America’s] favourite food,” campuses are once again beginning to become dominated by the neon lights of McDonald’s and Chick-fil-A. It is time for USC to recalibrate and bring health back to campuses.
