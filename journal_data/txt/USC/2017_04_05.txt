The National Hockey League announced on Monday that it had not reached a settlement with the International Olympic Committee, meaning the league will not send its players to the 2018 Winter Games in Pyeongchang, South Korea. The NHL was seeking more concessions from the IOC after being forced to schedule an inconvenient multi-week break in the season to accommodate its Olympians every four years.
But the two sides couldn’t compromise — neither ever really seemed to try — and the league followed through on its threat to skip the Games, declaring the matter “officially closed” in a press release. For the first time since the 1994, the best hockey players on the planet will not grace the Olympic ice, and their participation in Beijing 2022 appears to be in danger as well.
This was an outcome many saw coming after months of utterly unproductive negotiations between the NHL and IOC, but that doesn’t make it any less baffling. Almost every player and coach asked about Olympic participation has strongly supported it, and some, such as Washington Capitals superstar Alex Ovechkin, said they would travel to Pyeongchang even without the league’s support. With so much passion surrounding the Olympics, how can you justify barring athletes from competing for one of the greatest honors in their sport?
When the announcement was made, I had to be one of the most disappointed hockey fans on the planet. Ever since Pyeongchang won its bid for the Winter Games back in 2011, I had dreamed of watching NHL stars fly around the newly built Gangneung Hockey Centre a few hours east of my hometown of Seoul. I couldn’t wait to see some of my favorite Boston Bruins skate on Korean ice, and imagined that my brain would short-circuit if I ran into center Patrice Bergeron in the Olympic Village. Alas, it wasn’t to be, and now I would only think of Bergeron as selfish if he ditched the Bs to go play for Team Canada halfway through the 2017-2018 season.
There’s a lot of confusion right now about what the next step is. Teams could call on players from other professional leagues around the world (as Russia regularly does, pulling from the domestic KHL), or they could ask NHL teams to release their minor leaguers, veterans and prospects alike. But I have a better solution — one that would be a silver lining to this disappointment: full-on amateur hockey’s return to the Olympics.
I’m not sure if I would want it to stick around for good, but you can’t deny that it would be exciting to return to the format that led to the greatest sporting moment in American history, at least temporarily. I’ve watched the full replay of the Miracle on Ice on YouTube far too many times for someone who was 16 years from being born when it happened, but the magic bleeds through the screen every time.
“Do you believe in miracles? YES!”
Of course, it’s impossible to re-create either the circumstances or outcome of 1980 and that fateful day in Lake Placid, New York. That’s what made it a miracle. But a matchup between American and Russian amateurs would likely result in a rematch of the 2017 World Juniors semifinal in January, when the U.S. triumphed in a 4-3 nail-biter. Despite that tournament’s surprisingly sizable and passionate fanbase, however, the Olympics would take the rivalry to a new stage.
And unlike in the 2014 Games, when NHL superstars such as T.J. Oshie and Pavel Datsyuk starred, the players would be relatively anonymous. For most viewers, it would simply be nation versus nation — with players without other priorities like earning a contract extension and staying healthy for the rest of the season.
It’s an intriguing scenario, especially since U.S.-Russia tensions are probably at their highest now since 1980. President Donald Trump may be buddies with Russian president Vladimir Putin, but the allegations of election meddling have soured ties between the two countries. And they are guaranteed to meet in Pyeongchang, having been drawn in the same pool. If they both advance from Group B — which they are favorites to do — they could meet for a second time, possibly with a medal on the line.
Sure, it would have been great to watch the cream of the crop, the likes of Patrick Kane and Auston Matthews, face off against Ovechkin. But there are also plenty of reasons to get excited to watch young Americans such as Charlie McAvoy and Troy Terry potentially spearhead Team U.S.A. Both wowed at the World Juniors, coming up huge in the gold medal game against Canada. McAvoy tallied 2 points — a goal and an assist — as the two teams went to a shootout, where Terry converted the States’ lone successful attempt to win the championship.
Unfortunately, there’s no guarantee McAvoy or Terry would be allowed to go to Korea, either. McAvoy recently signed a tryout Amateur Try Out contract with the Bruins and could also miss the Olympics if he sticks at the NHL level. Terry remains on the University of Denver roster as the Pioneers play in the Frozen Four this weekend (McAvoy and Boston University were bounced in the quarterfinals), but the Anaheim Ducks own his rights after drafting him in 2015. If they opt to sign him early out of college, his availability for Pyeongchang would be in doubt. Considering he is just a sophomore, however, it seems like nothing would stop Terry from donning red, white and blue next February.
And that goes for most of this year’s junior roster, most of whom are still competing at the collegiate level. With the teams’ already-established chemistry, amateur hockey at the 2018 Games would likely be a much more fluid and exciting affair than a tournament with random collections of minor-league veterans. And like the 1980 team, many of the American amateurs will go on to have fruitful professional careers. After that, who knows? Maybe we’ll see the team again as All-Stars when the NHL returns to the Games — hopefully in four years.

No. 23 Stanford is coming off a marquee moment and the Trojans will have to try to stop their losing skid.
Last week, Stanford (15-9) head coach Mark Marquess earned his 1,600th win in a 8-4 victory over Cal. Meanwhile, the Trojans (15-12) have lost four straight games, scoring only six runs across them.
Despite their records going in opposite directions, the Trojans have  more wins in Pac-12 play, 4-to-3 against the Cardinal.
The struggle to score is still plaguing the Trojans. The team has been unable to use free passes from errors such as being hit by pitches or walked to their advantage, often stranding runners.
It is a dramatic difference from the team of the beginning of the season that won its first games against Coppin State and Wake Forest in blowouts. Back then, the Trojans’ pitching had been weaker, but the offense saved them. Now the pitching is stronger, giving up fewers runs than some of their earlier losses. However, the offense has been dormant with runners on.
Freshman Chris Clarke will most likely start on the mound for the Trojans on Thursday. He took a beating in his last outing, but has otherwise proven to be a strong spot in the rotation, especially given the loss of junior Mitch Hart.
The rotation against Stanford will change for USC as the team attempts to make adjustments. Previously, junior Brad Wegman (2-2) had been the No. 2 starter. However, sophomore CJ Stubbs took over his role last week and Wegman has been switched to long relief. Wegman seems to have had more success there, tossing three scoreless innings against Arizona on Saturday and a scoreless inning against Long Beach State on Tuesday.
Sophomore Marrick Crouse is still the No. 3 starter. With Stubbs’ promotion, however, junior Mason Perryman has taken over the duties of being the No. 4 starter. Freshman Connor Lunn has also success coming out of the bullpen, throwing 3.2 scoreless innings against Long Beach State in relief of Perryman.
Luckily for the Trojans, USC boasts a better record at home (11-5) while Stanford has struggled on the road, going 3-for-4 while visiting opponents.
Of all the teams in the Pac-12, Stanford ranks last in runs scored and runs batted in, which is good news for the Trojan pitching staff. If the Trojans score even a handful of runs, they should be in decent shape to win the game.
“Our pitching has been doing well, so we’re hoping they can keep doing that and trying to get those timely hits,” redshirt junior Frankie Rios said. “We haven’t been hitting so well lately.”
The series will be a good chance for the Trojans to regain their confidence in bringing in runners in scoring position.
One troublesome aspect of batting for USC has been the number of strikeouts the team allows on offense. They are second in the Pac-12 in strikeouts, which is not aiding their struggle to score.
The Trojans will face Stanford in a three-game series starting Thursday at 6 p.m. at Dedeaux Field.

In a couple weeks, Los Angeles will become the home of an ice cream sandwich swing, a seesaw shaped like an ice cream scooper, a colorful pool of sprinkles, as well as the many other eclectic art installations at the Museum of Ice Cream. The new attraction, which is located in the Arts District, will be a place where fantasy comes to life.
After winning the approval from hundreds of thousands  of people in New York City, the pop-up Museum of Ice Cream is shipping its pool of sprinkles to the West Coast. Beginning April 22, thousands of visitors will flock to the museum to make a splash in the world-renowned, swimmable sprinkle pool.

The Museum of Ice Cream is not only hopping to the West Coast, but is also expanding and improving its exhibits. The museum will expand to four times the size that it had been in New York City. The larger the museum, the larger and more interactive the exhibits will be. Favorite exhibits venturing out West include a banana split made up of 10,000 bananas, a mint “grow house,” a melted popsicle jungle and, of course, a sprinkle swimming pool filled with 100 million custom-made sprinkles.
Isabel Linder, a freshman majoring in English, spoke about her excitement for the museum’s arrival. Originally from the East Coast, Linder has wanted to go since the pop-up museum opened in New York City.
“I love ice cream, so the idea that I get to give a whole new meaning to playing with my favorite food is really exciting,” Linder said.
Maryellis Bunn, a design strategist who worked as the head of forecasting and innovation at Time Inc., co-founded and directed the Museum of Ice Cream. She channeled her enthusiasm and love for ice cream into an interactive and fun museum. Bunn’s mission for the museum is to constantly design environments that bring people together and provoke their imagination. It is a place where flavors are mysteries, toppings are played with as toys and sprinkles keep the world spinning.
The Museum of Ice Cream is not just a place that will be fun for visitors. Various creameries around Los Angeles will be an important part of the exhibits as well. The museum will have a Scoop of the Week, when creameries such as McConnell’s, Salt & Straw, Coolhaus X Cuisinart and CREAM will be showcasing their ice cream flavors. Every ticket includes two scoops of curated ice cream tastings.
Guests will not just taste ice cream, but they’ll smell it as well. The Museum worked closely with flavor and fragrance scientists at the International Flavors & Fragrances, an American corporation established in 1833 that creates scents and flavors inspired by ice cream flavors and toppings.
In addition to a Scoop of the Week, there will be mochi ice cream tastings from My/Mo and chocolate tastings from DOVE Chocolate. If visitors didn’t already imagine themselves at the Willy Wonka Chocolate Factory, swimming in a pool of sprinkles or running around in a jungle of melted popsicles, DOVE Chocolate makes sure these visitors will. In certain chocolates, there is the chance to find a golden chocolate. If they find it, they get to take home a prize, called a “winning promise.”
However, if the golden chocolate isn’t in the cards, visitors can still walk away with a souvenir from the museum. The shop has shirts, patches, pens, ice cream scents and perfumes, an ice cream scooper as well as a variety of other unique items.
The Museum of Ice Cream will make its appearance in Los Angeles from  April 22 to May 29. Doors are open from 11 a.m. to 10 p.m., Wednesdays through Mondays. General admission is $29 per person.

When he began our 5:30 p.m. interview by ordering himself a shot of espresso, a mocha and a tea, I could tell Nikhil Korula had not grown complacent in his success.
“Don’t be afraid of not having a schedule like anyone else’s because the best musicians, or the best businessmen — they’re not sleeping away the entire day,” Korula said.
Korula is a singer-songwriter who has shared the stage with music giants as wide-ranging as Herbie Hancock and John Mayer. A 2001 graduate of USC’s opera program, Korula has found his own musical niche writing what he calls a world-infused strain of pop meant to make you dance. But he doesn’t let his achievements stop him from maintaining a fastidious practice and songwriting regimen.
“The one thing that’s really hard to do as a musician is: How do you balance your time?” Korula said. “I could spend all day practicing. I want to spend all day practicing. But you have to find that balance if you say, ‘I want to play, I want to arrange sessions, I want to find work as a performer, as a producer.’”
That means Korula starts his day off with two songwriting sessions with his team, one from 11 a.m. to 2 p.m. and another in the afternoon. He spends the evening managing his business, returning emails and booking shows and tours. And at night, Korula practices all alone.
”Your best moments practicing are when no one’s listening,” Korula said.
Korula’s hard work paid off. Last year, Korula shared writing credit on “Start It Up,” the lead track from Ziggy Marley’s eponymous album, which went on to win this year’s Grammy for Best Reggae Album. Korula said that his musical achievements have led him to appreciate musical concision.
“The funny thing is, it’s come full circle, where the simplest things start to hit you more,” Korula said. “I was producing as an artist, and I was doing guitar tracks for this one song, by myself, in the middle of the night, when I started weeping. I was playing the most simple, two-note line, but the song was hitting me, and the parts were so perfect for the song. I said, ‘I’ve learned all this crazy stuff in music just to simplify.’”
Part of the success of Korula’s band, the NK Band, is due to his music’s
emotional vitality. Korula’s songs project joy and hope. That, plus the band’s unique ensemble sound, has earned it a diverse and loyal following.
But I wondered if Korula has ever felt confined by the expectations of his fans, or burdened by the task of uplifting them, show after show. Korula answered that the emotional dialogue he builds with his fans through music is what gives him energy.
“Being a creative, it is not all a parade,” Korula said. “You’re going to have ups and downs throughout your life, your career, and you have to document how you’re feeling in each moment. A lot of times, in my darkest moments, I would end up writing some of my happiest songs, almost to lift me up out of that place. And I think for me, the more I understand about myself, the more I’m able to be that vessel of positive energy.”
Understanding himself means that Korula also practices a healthy amount of self-care. He makes a point of avoiding creative projects he can’t put his heart into.
Korula’s success, then, hinges on his ability to balance creativity with self-compassion and business skills. He returns his emails every day, but he trusts his abilities enough to follow a creative thread even when the payoff is uncertain. And he knows when it’s time to take a break.
“When I’m on the road, I don’t always sleep as much as I want to sleep, but that day when I come back,” Korula said. “I make sure I have nothing to do. And then I sleep.”
I asked Korula to share a favorite story from the road, and he chose one that he said reminds him of how committed he wants to be to his fans. The show was a 2009 gig in Carbondale, Ill.
“It was the University of Southern Illinois, right around late June,” Korula said. “So I’m outside, and there’s lightning, and they’re covering instruments … And I’m like, ‘But [fans are] waiting in the rain. Those people are waiting outside, and they’re not going home, so we’re not going home.’”
Korula and his band waited it out and played their full set when the rain lightened up. He told me that such moments affirm to him the power of music.
“We are gifted to embrace a moment, and express that moment through sound, to affect people,” Korula said.
“That is a tremendous responsibility that people may take for granted, but every moment is like a soundtrack.”
The NK Band’s next local show is June 25 as part of Pasadena’s Arroyo Seco Weekend.

Nestled between the Hollywood Historic Hotel and radiating from the drabness of Melrose Avenue stands The Edmon, a modern-day testament to the gilded age of Hollywood.
Visitors were greeted by the ornate front door embossed with a bold “E” before entering into a dimly lit, spacious dining room reminiscent of the 1920s.
With classic Art Deco architecture, soaring ceilings, softly glowing chandeliers and a glittering bar that stretched the expanse of the back wall, the room effortlessly evoked a
Gatsby-esque elegance. The towering bar — stocked with a kaleidoscopic display of liquors and framed with decorated wooden panels — was the dining room’s most impressive feature, while the rest of its dark dining tables paled in comparison.
A series of throwback tunes featuring The Beatles and similar bands created an energized yet relaxing ambience. Even the bathrooms aligned with the calm, chic atmosphere, with gilded matte black wallpaper and clean-cut, black-and-white tiling.
The Edmon’s dinner menu consisted of an extensive cocktail, wine and beer menu, sectioned off by starters, plates, sides, shareable plates and charcuterie. It diverged from traditional offerings such as salads and soups and instead harkens to the extravagance of the Jazz Age, replete with small intrigues such as toasted hemp seeds, sunchoke veloute and fried quail egg.
The menus were printed on crisp, parchment-like paper with calligraphic adornments that fit the old-timey theme.
The Edmon boasted a variety of cured meats and cheeses in different combinations and shareable sizes for different prices. The two-person charcuterie dish came on an elegantly minimalist wooden board with wild boar salami, Spanish ham, prosciutto, blue cheese and goat cheese arranged alongside a selection of sauces such as dijon mustard, whole grain mustard and ghost pepper jam. The ensemble was  complemented by a delightfully crisp and soft freshly baked bread basket.
What the main plates lacked in vegetarian options, they more than make up for with vibrant flavors and refined presentation. The Tasmanian trout was grilled to perfection with a briny crust atop tender fish, imbued with citrus undertones. It was presented alongside red frill mustard, orange segments, radishes and an apple reduction sauce. The lamb shank ragu with thick sheets of buckwheat pappardelle pasta had astonishingly tender slices of meat and a decadent vegetable-infused sauce.
Other main course options — with prices ranging from $17 to $34 — included a hanger steak, roasted half chicken and wild boar chop, all with flairs of fanciful flavors and accompaniments conceptualized by executive chef Gabriel Cappelli.
For dessert, the bread pudding came fresh from the oven in a scorching square skillet, topped with toasted honey meringue and white chocolate pearls. With just one bite, the pudding melts easily.  The only other dessert option was a banana split with vanilla and strawberry miso ice cream, chocolate ganache and matcha white chocolate. However, the menu also offered a diversity of dessert wines.
After each course, plates and utensils were cleared and the table was carefully wiped clean of crumbs and greases by a server. Though food service was slow, the servers were attentive, personable and knowledgeable about the unique nuances of the restaurant’s offerings.
Ultimately, The Edmon may be out of most college students’ budgets; the restaurant is frequented by celebrities. However, its timeless homage to the Golden Age of Hollywood and its endlessly piquant menu render it an artistic and culinary jewel that, despite the cost, is definitely worth indulging in at least once.

Sen. Bernie Sanders, Sen. Elizabeth Warren and other democratic heavyweights joined forces on April 3 to introduce the College for All Act, a bill that establishes free public colleges and universities for students with family incomes under $125,000, increases funding for federal work-study, makes community college free and lowers student loan interest rates. While the bill is not likely to pass due to current state of Congress, this action demonstrates the progressive commitment to higher education accessibility while revealing the work that still needs to be done under the Trump administration.
Because millennials comprise a larger share of liberal voters, and Democratic politicians have begun to cater their policies toward this young voting bloc. With rising student debt and increasing cost of higher education, 2016 presidential hopefuls Sanders and Hillary Clinton’s education bills appealed to many millennial voters prior to the election. This bill, in contrast to Trump’s education cuts, aims to garner support and excitement from progressives, yet still falls short.
Nearly 50 years ago, only a quarter of middle-class workers had beyond a high school education, but today about 60 percent of jobs in the U.S. economy require higher education. As lower-skilled jobs are increasingly shipped overseas, the skills required by American employers have greatly increased. This, in turn, creates a larger wage gap and perpetuates the cycle of income inequality.
If President Donald Trump truly wants to employ Americans and create jobs, investment in education and making higher education a reality is an absolute necessity. Realistically, the jobs that have already been sent overseas are not coming back and cries from the President to “take back the jobs” have little to no realistic possibility. As Trump should be able to understand, given his history of managing a multination corporation that profits from the international labor that he condemns, it makes little business sense for American companies to “bring back our jobs.”
Instead, Trump must focus on the development of skill sets that employers require and need. Instead of harkening back to a nostalgic past where blue collar jobs dominated the economy, our government has a responsibility to fill the gaps between the skills of our population and the necessities of the business sector. The jobs don’t need to be created — they’re already here.
There are a few different solutions to the skills deficit that is plaguing our work force today. The first is a bill such as the one Sanders and Warren proposed, focusing on improving the higher education that currently exists. Cutting student loans interest rates and funding federal grants are absolutely crucial. This not only has a positive impact on closing the skills deficit, but it also upholds the fundamental principle of a highly educated citizenry upholding democracy. Yet, like many other planks in Sander’s platform, this bill remains impossible to realize in today’s political climate.
Another avenue to close this skills gap is to invest in more specialized programs such as the J.P. Morgan “New Skills at Work” Program, a $250 million initiative to help train people for specific jobs and programs. Deficits are especially prominent in fields such as science, technology and mathematics, which need increased training even for graduates of elite higher institutions. Vocational training programs may be a way to directly impact lower-income and less accessible areas. Though they may not provide the same intellectual breadth that universities and colleges pride themselves on, apprenticeship-centered and skills-based trainings would allow direct employment opportunities. These programs would come at a lower cost to taxpayers, and would be a more targeted way to approach the issue.
A bill such as the College for All Act is more about placing education back on our nation’s set of priorities. Additionally, direct programs and pre-professional academies may have a short-term and more immediate impact. These type of programs can indicate the beginning of compromise between bipartisan politicians and can begin the journey of making education a non-partisan education.
It’s time to double down on the notion that education is a human right.

California State Sen. Connie Leyva put forth a bill last month that would make the abortion pill accessible at all California public colleges with health centers that receive funding from the state. The abortion pill is a two-pill dosage of misoprostol and mifepristone, which inhibits the hormones necessary for pregnancy and, while approved by the Food and Drug Administration 16 years ago, requirements to access the pill vary widely across The United States.
While the bill does not include surgical abortions, it would be a step toward making a crucial women’s health service accessible to young women with limited economic means. After all, for female college students, control over their bodies is what makes higher education possible. But ultimately, by bringing abortion via the abortion pill to California campus health centers, the bill would also be a powerful step toward destigmatizing an objectively safe, medically necessary procedure, and toward unraveling the paternalistic, pernicious and, unfortunately, highly successful rhetoric conservatives have used to sideline abortion for decades.
Leyva’s bill still awaits debate and voting on the Senate floor, but it’s already fairly easy to anticipate the pushback in the form of paternalism and condescension disguised as concern for young women’s safety.
It’s worth noting that for all the expensive, medically unnecessary and — as of June 2016 — unconstitutional hospital requirements forced onto abortion clinics, surgical abortion is vastly safe. According to research by Columbia University, women are 14 times more likely to die giving birth than having a surgical abortion. And abortion medication, the object of Leyva’s bill, is arguably even safer. Since the FDA approval of the abortion pill in 2001, 3 million women have taken the abortion pill, and of those, only 19 women died of pill-related complications.
It’s funny that abortion opponents who are supposedly concerned with women’s safety couldn’t even take the time to acknowledge this research. Their opposition to abortion accessibility on campuses — to the extent that they are willing to put the health and academic interests of female college students on the backburner — is, in reality, the advancement of political agenda and personal ideology. They might as well just be transparent about it.
The debate about abortion accessibility on college campuses is sure to be a heated one since abortion, despite objectively being a medical procedure like any other, remains mired in controversy. The reason is far from random — it is the disturbingly effective conservative rhetoric that attacks abortion and makes it the great untouchable subject that it is, with two strategies.
One of these is, of course, to fear-monger and present abortion as dangerous; This results in harmful regulations on abortion that shut down clinics and render the procedure inaccessible to women without the economic means to travel out of state. That being said, a surge in popularity in abortion medication over the years (43 percent of abortions in 2014 were abortion medications, up from 35 percent in 2010) runs parallel to an increased trend of clinic shutdowns in rural states since 2012. This speaks to prevalent research that laws meant to restrict abortion — from mandated waiting periods to second-trimester bans — have no effect on the rate at which abortions occur. (A piece of advice for any anti-abortion conspirators who may be reading — guess what? Affordable contraception and accurate sexual health education actually do!)
The other part of conservatives’ rhetorical strategy is to portray abortion as murder. In anti-abortion narratives, whether for a 20-week fetus or a fertilized egg, abortion is baby-killing. And the consequences of this rhetoric can be deeply dangerous — extremists such as Robert Dear, who shot three dead at a Colorado Planned Parenthood clinic in 2015 to be a “warrior for the babies,” may retaliate.
Conservatives are able to pass restrictions on abortion in state legislatures across the nation because they have the rhetoric down to an art. Policies that put conservatives’ inflated notions of moral superiority before women’s health and safety pass because  their constituents often believe abortion is dangerous, shameful, criminal and should not be discussed objectively, let alone made accessible to those who need it.
And that’s precisely why the bill Leyva introduced to the California State Senate is such a game-changer. It brings abortion to college campuses  and makes abortion, as the crucial health service that it is, accessible to the women who arguably need it most.
Abortion is not dangerous. It is a health service that women with different ambitions, academic goals, dreams and desires need — no amount of rhetoric and boogeyman stories will change this. Legislation to mandate access to abortion on campus finally — crucially — acknowledges this reality.
Kylie Cheung is a freshman majoring in journalism and political science.  She is also the editorial director of the Daily Trojan. Her column,“You Do Uterus,” runs every Thursday.
Why don’t YOU get an abortion and then keep writing these garbage columns about how it’s a good thing. Or actually, your visage will serve plenty well as the next best thing after the condom in preventing unwanted pregnancies.
The author should at least accept that abortion is an elective procedure in most cases.  I find statements that abortion is a “medically necessary procedure” and that abortion is “objectively …. a medical procedure like any other”  a little disturbing even though I’m pro-choice.
If you are going to write on this issue get off of your political soap box, quit the mindless conservative bashing and address the actual proposal in Sen. Leyva’s bill.  I work in a public university student health center and there is no way the requirements of this bill can or will be implemented.
First at community colleges & CSU campuses this bill is useless.  Students on those campuses are not required to have health insurance and the health centers do not bill health insurance.  In the CSU health center pharmacies students pay cash for medications  The cost of these “abortion pills” is $600-800 so no student is going to buy the medication in the health canter and there is no way to bill insurance for the medication in that setting.  So Sen. Leyva may try to force the service on to community colleges & CSU systems but economics will prevent it from being used.
Both you and Senator Leyva should understand the health services provided on public college and university campuses in California before

Forward Bennie Boatwright will declare for the NBA Draft but will not hire an agent, USC confirmed on Wednesday. The decision to forgo the hiring of an agent will allow Boatwright to test the waters of his current prospects in the NBA without forgoing his future eligibility as a college athlete.
Boatwright spent almost half of last season on the bench after spraining his MCL in an early December game against San Diego. After taking two months to heal from the knee injury, he roared back into the starting lineup for the Trojans, dropping 23 points in his return against Washington.
Although the injury kept him off the court for the first half of Pac-12 play, it did not keep Boatwright from contributing to his team. He finished the season averaging 27.6 points and 4.5 rebounds.
Most importantly, Boatwright provided a vital spark throughout the team’s NCAA tournament run. He dropped a career-high 24 points against Providence, leading his team to rally back from a 17-point deficit to knock out a victory in the redemption match up.
The following game, Boatwright contributed 14 points to help in a stunning upset over SMU to advance to the Round of 32. And although the Trojans fell to Baylor to end their time in the Big Dance, Boatwright notched 16 points to keep his team neck-and-neck until the end.
Though his team learned to live without him this season, Boatwright was a vital piece of the Trojans’ offense and defense when he returned to the court. His announcement comes on the heels of a similar declaration by redshirt sophomore guard Shaqquan Aaron, who will also enter this year’s draft but not hire of an agent.
The futures of Boatwright and fellow sophomore forward Chimezie Metu were the most unclear for Trojan fans following the NCAA tournament. Metu has yet to announce his intentions for next season, but is also a possibility to declare for the NBA draft despite retaining two more years of college eligibility to play for the Trojans.
Although Boatwright and Aaron have declared for the draft, both could still return to the Trojans’ squad for next season. Due to their decision to not hire an agent, both players retain NCAA eligibility. They will have until May 24 to withdraw from the draft if they choose to continue in college next season.Until then, they will test the waters for any prospective outlets in the NBA in order to make an informed decision about which path to take.
Without Boatwright, head coach Andy Enfield would face challenges in filling the forward position to make up for his playmaking abilities and physical strength down low. However, if none of the three sophomores in question — Boatwright, Aaron and Metu — leave for the draft, expectations will be high for the Trojans next season.
The days leading up until May 24 will be a telling time for the Trojans, and no matter which way Boatwright goes, the decisions of young players will determine how the team will rebuild into next season.

Men’s basketball head coach Andy Enfield was granted a contract extension through 2023, Athletic Director Lynn Swann announced on Wednesday. Terms of the deal were not disclosed.
In four years, Enfield has revived the Trojans basketball program from dead last in the Pac-12 to a NCAA Tournament contender winning more games each and every season. The 47 wins in the last two seasons mark the most in any two-year stretch in program history. In 2016-2017, USC started 14-0, its best start since the 1971 season, and finished with a program record 26 wins, including two victories in the NCAA Tournament.
“With Andy Enfield as our head coach, we have built consistency and stability in our men’s basketball program,” Swann said. “Extending Andy’s contract will allow that consistency and stability to continue. The record-setting season we just had is proof that Andy has established the USC program as an annual contender on the national level.”
The team continued to succeed under Enfield this season, battling against mid-season injuries and cross-country doubters to clinch a spot in the play-in game for the No. 11 seed in the NCAA tournament. After storming back in a redemption matchup against Providence, Enfield led his Trojans to upset No. 6-seeded SMU.
The team’s time in the big dance ended with a 4-point loss to Baylor, a No. 3 seed expected to walk over USC on their way to the Sweet Sixteen and beyond. This year’s performance was a massive improvement, giving the team its second consecutive tournament berth after only a single NCAA appearance over the four years of Enfield’s predecessor, Kevin O’Neill.
And the team’s run in the NCAA tournament turned heads across the country, earning Top 15 rankings in premature Top 25 predictions from USA Today, Sports Illustrated and NBC Sports.
Katlyn Lee | Daily Trojan
Before coming to Los Angeles, Enfield coached at Florida Gulf Coast University, leading the program its first No. 15 seed in the 2013 NCAA Tournament. Under Enfield, the team went on to upset No. 2 seed Georgetown and No. 7 seed San Diego State, becoming the first No. 15 seed to reach the Sweet Sixteen.
The run came to an end against No. 3 Florida, but Enfield’s success after such a short time with a young program made its mark in the national attention. His impact on the Trojans’ program has been similar in the last two years, but the six-year extension will help to give him the time he needs to cultivate a winning program that can compete in a Pac-12 that is consistently growing as a national powerhouse in basketball.
Between sophomore forward Bennie Boatwright’s declaration for the NBA Draft and the possibility that fellow sophomore forward Chimezie Metu could follow, the team’s future isn’t entirely etched in stone. But the Trojans’ performance in his first two seasons has given Enfield and his team confidence as they look forward.
“Our coaching staff is proud of our players’ development and accomplishments both in the classroom and on the court,” Enfield said. “With the core of veteran returnees and incoming talented freshmen, we are excited about the future of USC basketball.”

Photo from USC NewsFarewell address · Alternative medicine advocate Deepak Chopra will speak as part of the University’s commencement festivities.
Deepak Chopra, a well-known author and medical pioneer, will present the 134th baccalaureate address on May 12 as part of the 2017 commencement. 
For the University, baccalaureate serves as a nondenominational celebration for the graduates and their friends and families.
The ceremony is interfaith, but the graduates will receive a blessing to commemorate their success as they embark on the next chapter of their lives.
Past speakers include Rainn Wilson, an actor notable for his role of Dwight Schrute on the American comedy series The Office, spiritual teacher Marianne Williamson and essayist Pico Iyer.
Chopra has written over 85 books in close to 43 different languages, 24 of which have made the New York Times best seller list. 
In 1993, he was featured on Oprah for his close relationship with Michael Jackson and world-renowned book Ageless Body, Timeless Mind: The Quantum Alternative to Growing Old.
His book was one of the first to analyze the ability humans have to retain creativity, memory, self-esteem and physical strength despite the passage of time. 
Chopra’s scientific theories blend with the ancient Indian AyurVeda meditation technique to prove that humans can counter the way we age. 
Chopra is also the founder of The Chopra Foundation, an organization dedicated to improving health and well-being, cultivating spiritual knowledge, expanding consciousness, and promoting world peace, according to the foundation’s website.
He is also the founder of The Chopra Center for Wellbeing, an outlet that provides meditation and yoga to promote well-being and self-awareness.
When speaking publicly, Chopra often presents on internal medicine, well-being, metabolism and endocrinology.
He is currently a professor at the University of California, San Diego School of Medicine and a researcher at Massachusetts General Hospital.
Chopra has been a pioneer in bridging ancient healing wisdom with modern science. This philosophy is shared by the University’s Center for Integrative Medicine.
Chopra’s baccalaureate address will be followed by actor Will Ferrell’s commencement address.

After an extended debate, Undergraduate Student Government Senators voted to approve USG President Austin Dunn’s appointees for USG Director positions at the Senate meeting on Tuesday.
Dunn appointed directors, who will lead sections of USG like the marketing and funding boards for the 2017-2018 school year.
Following Dunn’s presentation on the appointments, the Senate debated whether or not to confirm them. Some senators said they were uninformed of their opportunity to review Dunn’s appointments prior to the meeting, while others questioned the appointments, specifically within the Advocacy Branch.
Sen. Isabella Smith, who was absent at the meeting, urged the Senate to postpone the confirmation until next week, according to a statement read by Sen. Katie Han on Smith’s behalf.
“I think that postponing the vote would be beneficial because I’d like some more information on some of the people selected, particularly in the Advocacy Branch,” Smith said. “I want everyone to be voting in an informed way, and I know many people here were not given enough information to do so.”
Sen. Noah Silver also expressed concern over the Senate’s lack of familiarity with Dunn’s appointments.
“[The senators] did have the week to review the applicants, but I don’t think most of us understood that we had that week or that we were within that right to do so, so I don’t think that week was fully taken advantage of,” Silver said.
However, Sen. Joey Hall urged the Senate to rely on Dunn’s judgment and confirm the appointments immediately instead of next week.
“The process itself seems like [Dunn and the USG Executive Board] are supposed to be doing the job of electing [directors] in the first place, and Senate has not been part of the application process before,” Hall said. “Just going off of how it was, and this is the way we are just affirming his vote, I think we should respect his opinion.”
The former USG administration attended the meeting in order to assist the new Senate with parliamentary procedure. After many points of clarification and open debate, the Senate moved to deny postponing the confirmation, and affirmed the appointed Directors immediately.
“I think previously serving as Vice President, I understand that this is a very hard process to pick up on,” Dunn said. “We’re still in the process of transitioning, and the hardest thing that Senate has to go through is they don’t really get a transition period.”
In order to help with this transition and foster positive relations between himself and the new Senate, Dunn said he aims to stress his role as an approachable resource.
“I think one thing I’ve already noticed is sometimes there’s this natural intimidation between members of the organization about talking to the president, but I’m very much the open-door policy type,” Dunn said. “I made it very clear today that I will never tell Senate what to do — that’s not who I want to be or how I want to lead, but more so working in conjunction with one another and serving as a resource whenever I can.”

More than two months into the new presidential administration, the partisan gap between Democrats and Republicans is deeper than ever — a divide that was clear on Tuesday night as panelists debated the existence of equality in the United States under President Donald Trump. 
The event, which was hosted by the Jesse M. Unruh Institute of Politics, aimed to dissect a number of issues affecting citizens, such as income inequality, immigration and racism. Unruh director Bob Shrum and political science and international relations doctoral candidate Fabian Gonzales moderated the discussion.
The panelists included Ehsan Zaffar, a professor at the American University College of Law; John Thomas, a political analyst at KFI AM; and Ange-Marie Hancock; a professor of political science, gender studies and sociology at the USC Dornsife College of Letters, Arts and Sciences. 
The event started with an analysis of income inequality and the role of women in the current political administration, particularly given the recent Senate vote to allow states to block funding for organizations such as Planned Parenthood. Hancock argued that although there were women represented in positions of power in the White House, such as Assistant to the President Ivanka Trump and Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos, inequality is still rampant.
“It makes it very difficult for women who are trying to get equal access to opportunities to actually have the data to present their case because so much is swept under the rug,” Hancock said. “I think it’s a real challenge for women to understand where they can make progress in terms of policy.”
Thomas, who identified himself as a member of the Republican party, argued that economic regulation suffocated businesses, when stumped job growth. Under Trump, he said, this pattern has changed.
“I think that what we’re seeing here is freedom,” Thomas said. “It’s a significant shift. For the last eight years it was the reverse — Barack Obama felt that the federal government should dictate and that the state should follow.”
In addition, the panelists described their views on Trump’s immigration policies, especially regarding his temporary ban on travelers from six majority-Muslim countries. Zaffar said that people who support the ban conflate terrorism with a threat from people of the Muslim faith.
“We, in the United States, tend to focus on acts of terror that rile the national psyche in a way that resonates with people that is contrary to evidence that actually exists,” Zaffar said.
Zaffar went on to state that the way that we assess terrorism now is primarily based on Islamic extremism, which is rooted in a faulty understanding of Islam. He pointed to the lack of security in train stations, such as Amtrak, as opposed to the intensive security in airports. 
“The way that we allocate resources towards terrorism is not a good way to fight terrorism,” Zaffar said. “I expect more out of my political leaders, and I want them to keep me safe.” 
The panelists also discussed the administration’s attitude toward the African American community, focusing particularly on voter identification laws, which often require voters to show identification when reaching voter booths. Voter identification laws often reduce turnout, since many low-income citizens and voters of color often do not have driver’s licenses, according to The Atlantic.
Hancock stated that a field experiment conducted by one of her students demonstrated that the legislators who had higher levels of “racial hostility” were more likely to support voter identification bans. However, she said Trump’s position on this issue is still unclear. 
“I think that Trump could be swayed both ways on social issues,” Hancock said. “He could really go either way.” 
“Zaffar said that people who support the ban conflate terrorism with a threat from people of the Muslim faith.”
And is this connection somehow not real?  
Are you suggesting that 95% of all terrorist attacks are not committed by Muslims?  If so, what alternate reality do you live in?
You have to understand the Democratic Party’s reasons for their obstructionist views and the rhetoric of sedition. They lost the presidency. They lost the House, the Senate, and a lot of stat r and local representation.  The means they lost their power to control you.  Democrats have run the education systems in this country for 40+ years and have indoctrinated our kids into a socialist minset. Even US is moving in that direction.  A liberal perspective used to be an alternative viewpoint a conservative view, but today classic liberalism doesn’t exists.  It has become a far leftist ideology that is destructive to the future of America and our freedoms.  
Obama, Clinton, Schumer now…… they are not interested in you.  They are interested in power and control over your mind, your person, your wallet and your life.  That’s the Democratic Parry platform.  They are not interested in helping you learn to be self sufficient.  You cannot be controlled if you are.
It’s interesting that forums like this could be very informative and useful when applied to discussing causes that are really relevant in today’s world, such as government funding of the mass genocide of the unborn child, Obama over reach in spying on Americwns, breaches of security, Clinton cash for money laundering operations, Fast and Furious, IRS targeting conservative groups, Ben glazing lies perpetuated by the Obama Administration ….. there’s more, but too much to go mm into here.
As for President Trump, if the Dems cooperated with Trump, we would all be so much better off.  Sore losers are holding upmprogress, but Trump will continue to rebuild America and we all, God willing, will make America great again.

Annenberg lecturer Lisa Pecot-Hébert wants to burst America’s bubble. Pecot-Hébert, along with adjunct professor David Measer, spent eight months researching America’s “alt-middle” — the 100 million people in between the two coasts — and whether or not stereotypes about them hold up. 
Pecot-Hébert and Measer delivered the lecture “100 Million People You Don’t Know, But Should” to students and faculty on Tuesday, two weeks after the pair gave the same presentation at the South by Southwest media festival. The study was backed by the advertising agency RPA, where Measer is a vice president. Pecot-Hébert examined the topic from a journalism perspective, while Measer studied it from a marketing one. 
Measer began the presentation by asking who in the room had seen Westworld, then who in the room had traveled out of the country in the last few years, and eventually, who had seen a recent Daytona 500 victory. Some people in the audience raised their hands at first, then nearly all of them, and finally none. 
He explained that this room mirrored the crowd of 1,000 people at the South by Southwest presentation, and that those who live in America’s top 21 most populated cities are all in a similar bubble that follows the same trends, one that makes it difficult to see another person’s point of view.
“It’s very easy to form affinity groups among like-minded people,” Measer said. “It’s very easy to share experiences, preferences and attitudes with people who you see eye to eye with.”
Measer and Pecot-Hébert argue that living in these coastal states skews our perception of America.
“There’s a prevailing gospel in this country that was forged post-9/11,” Measer said. “This narrative showed that we derive our strength as a country from our diversity.”
Measer played the ad “I am an American,” which featured people of different ages and ethnicities repeating the line. This melting pot idea is true in Los Angeles, Measer argued, but as more Americans saw coverage of Trump supporters, a much less diverse image appeared, putting a crack in the “differences make us great” narrative. 
For this study, Measer and Pecot-Hébert wanted to know what happened when they took off these top 21 cities and examined the narrative in the rest of America, which “coastal elites” might dismiss as flyover states.
After looking at quantitative data, Measer and Pecot-Hébert reported seeing trends — the top 21 cities had more white-collar jobs while the alt-middle had more blue-collar. The top 21 watched Game of Thrones; the alt-middle watched Big Time RV. But the pair said they were discouraged by these stereotypes, which seemed to pigeonhole 100 million people into cliches. They decided to switch to qualitative data, and took to frozen corn fields and farmers’ living rooms to interview over 40 people in six states in Middle America from Kansas to North Dakota.
According to Measer and Pecot-Hébert, these interviews created a more concrete view of the alt-middle, one that Pecot-Hébert said blew her stereotypes away. The two condensed what they had learned into four categories of what everyone should know about these 100 million people, including that they “thrive on human connection” and then explained how what they learned translated into their respective fields. 
Measer explained that in marketing, this data was invaluable — when advertisers mirror their world, they isolate and lose the rest of the audience. He said that interviewing people tells a lot more than just Googling. 
According to Pecot-Hébert, journalists can learn something similar. She hopes that reporters learn to publish stories that are representative of more than just the top 21 cities.
“Or the top five, if we’re being real,” Pecot-Hébert said. 
Pecot-Hébert explained that she wants to train journalists to be non-judgmental and reflective of all Americans because “coastal” papers like The New York Times are papers of record. People all across America hear stories from the coast, but people on the coast rarely hear stories from the middle of America, she said.
In the future, Pecot-Hébert and Measer wish to replicate their study in the South and hope to make a podcast and take their research on the road. They said they want to continue compiling information that will inform journalists, advertisers and Americans across the country.
