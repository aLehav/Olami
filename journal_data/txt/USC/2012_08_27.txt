There’s a lot to love about the literature here.
Los Angeles has a wellspring of talented young authors, a history with scores of classic writers and an unusually rich noir culture, so it’s easy to see why the annual Los Angeles Times Festival of Books (moved two years ago from UCLA to USC) now draws upward of 100,000 visitors to sample new work and hear famous authors speak.
Oddly enough, despite the heady cocktail of sunshine, celebrity and the American Dream that is the Los Angeles of our imagination, most of the classic literature about the city is negative.
Frank Lloyd Wright once said, “Tip the world over on its side and everything loose will land in Los Angeles.” In On the Road, Jack Kerouac wrote that Los Angeles was the loneliest and most brutal of American cities. Norman Mailer famously called the city a “constellation of plastic.” Famous quips rendered by this formidable clique of writers, including the likes of Dorothy Parker and Christopher Hitchens, have allowed those who had not yet formed opinions about Los Angeles to latch onto that negativity quickly; instead of forming their own perspectives, some readers believe that the city’s intellectual capacity should be caricaturized because their favorite author said something funny about it.
Still, for those who don’t mind reading cynical depictions of Los Angeles, Charles Bukowski’s literature offers a well-written, if pessimistic, perspective of the city. Dubbed the “Poet Laureate of Skid Row,” the L.A. native wrote a staggering anthology about the City of Angels that warrants a read from even a regular city-dweller. Still, you can learn from his writing, even if you don’t like it. Ham on Rye, which follows a cynical protagonist through adolescence in Los Angeles during the Great Depression, is a great introduction to the darker side of Los Angeles.
If you’re one of those people who insists poetry is more intellectual, try reading So Now?, To The Whore Who Took My Poems or Melancholia. You’ll get a feel for certain key parts of the city, even with the  ennui that will nag at you when you’re done.
Still, despite the success of these particular works of literature, there’s no reason to believe that the best literature about Los Angeles is unflattering. Several artists embraced Los Angeles’ eccentricities and relished the perspective that came with the city’s apparent indifference to the human soul.
Andy Warhol said the people were plastic, but that was fine by him. The stories in Gerald Goldberg’s 126 Days of Continuous Sunshine contain characters that thrived on the chaos just as others were defeated by it. Read around and decide for yourself how the city makes you feel.
If you’re in search of L.A. literature with a humorous touch, reach for The Tortilla Curtain by former USC professor T.C. Boyle. Los Angeles has a nearly unparalleled dichotomy between its rich and its poor, and this novel is one of the best ways to look at both. Boyle places the story of an undocumented couple from Mexico surviving on dumpster scraps alongside the story of a comfortably wealthy white couple. The two plots weave together when both sets of characters are involved in the same car accident.
It would be remiss to talk about L.A. literature without mentioning Joan Didion. If you haven’t read The Year of Magical Thinking, Didion’s Pulitzer Prize-winning recollection of death and ill-health in her family (don’t be put off by the plot), do so immediately. Many of her essays from Slouching Towards Bethlehem are also provocative if you really want to get into the guts of L.A. culture — the politics, the drugs, the naivete, the wealth, everything.
Still, despite Didion’s meticulous literary style, less-structured novels can provide great reads. Ray Bradbury’s Dandelion Wine provides something more applicable to your life in and out of Los Angeles. Maybe you already read it in high school, but it’s really a classic for you to enjoy, not parse.
For a more condensed take on L.A. literature, check out 2002’s Writing Los Angeles collection. The authors selected for the compilation give a cutting, even humiliating impression of the city, for which the best antidote is Scott Timberg’s The Misread City.
Nevertheless, despite whatever you choose to read, such a variety of perspectives are sure to grab your attention and help you develop your own way of defining the city.
Welcome to Los Angeles.

If you’ve ever found yourself gleefully watching films about green ogres, fun-loving zoo animals or a feisty feline bandit with a Spanish accent, you’ve experienced the work of the imaginative minds at DreamWorks Animation.
Behind the scenes · “DreamWorlds” visitors can enjoy early sketches of the studio’s major films, such as The Prince of Egypt and Madagascar. – Zoe Roth | Daily Trojan
Now, the studio is bringing two decades of innovative legacy to USC with an exhibition titled “DreamWorlds: Behind the Scenes Production Art From DreamWorks Animation.” The exhibit is a glimpse at the artistry of DreamWorks’ extensive repertoire of animated features, including favorites such as Shrek, Antz and The Prince of Egypt.
“[The exhibit] really gives you a whole new insight for the level of imagination and creativity that goes into animation,” said Jeffrey Katzenberg, CEO of DreamWorks Animation at the opening reception for “DreamWorlds” on July 31. “I’m sitting here looking at art from Madagascar, and I remember very much the inspiration that created that movie.”
Now open to the public, this curated display boasts more than 100 digital prints and several original paintings from DreamWorks’ 24 animated features. From seeing a character sketch on a humble Post-it note to watching the end product projected on a large screen in all its colorful glory, “DreamWorlds” is a complete experience that takes viewers from inception to fulfillment in a walk around the exhibit.
Walking into the room, visitors will be awestruck by a towering eight-foot statue of Po from Kung Fu Panda, a promising sign of what lies ahead. The dimly lit gallery is decorated with every kind of detailed production art, from paintings and photos covering every wall to three-dimensional lifelike character statues propped up on pedestals around the room. The mood is further enhanced by the majestic,  orchestral music, which plays from the nearby miniature movie theater, accompanying the walking tour. All this makes the exhibit the ideal space to observe and contemplate the inner workings of the animators’ creative minds.
The chronology of character development that adorns the gallery walls is one of many remarkable aspects of the exhibit. For example, visitors can see first-hand the metamorphosis of Shrek through meticulously sketched drafts, which transform into the lovable monster later translated into a successful movie franchise.
The presence of small, handwritten notes on some of the drawings also illustrates the studio’s incredible attention to detail. One sketch of Madagascar’s Marty the Zebra, for example, includes scribbled suggestions that ask the artist to darken his eyebrows and add an additional stripe to his backside. These serve as a reminder that animation is a collaborative effort and that it takes the hands and minds of many artists to create a single image.
Media stations are also available for visitors to observe the extensive development each feature undergoes before it hits theaters. A progression reel from the 2010 film How to Train Your Dragon details all the steps animators utilize, from basic movement to coloring and lighting. Character sculptures and miniature sets also demonstrate how animators visualize their fantasy worlds before setting them on the screen.
Exhibition Director Lisa Mann, who is enjoying her 14th year as faculty at the School of Cinematic Arts, led the charge in bringing “DreamWorlds” to campus. While DreamWorks has held gallery exhibits at different locations in the past, the studio made sure this one was especially comprehensive and unique to USC.
“They printed out a lot of other work that has never been seen before, and we included original artwork which I don’t believe was in the other shows,” Mann said. “I think we raised the bar and really used this space the way it’s meant to be. It’s very exciting.”
With its clever storylines, beauty and escapism, the “DreamWorlds” exhibit showcases everything that has made animation a significant part of popular culture.
“Bringing here the best and the brightest students, giving them the best tools, great teachers, inspiring them with art like this … we’ve seen the results,” Katzenberg said. “We have 90 [USC] alumni at our company today, which is extraordinary.”
Whether you’re an aspiring animator or just a fan of these films, come experience the magic behind this exhibit and celebrate an art form that has become so much more than a Saturday morning cartoon.
 
“DreamWorlds” is open to the public now through Friday, Sept. 7 from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. in the USC School of Cinematic Arts’ first floor gallery at the Steven Spielberg Building.

If there’s still room in your schedule for the fall semester, a certain Grammy Award-winning professor might have some insights worth considering.
Techno-logic · Peter Erskine uses cutting-edge technology to develop a minus-one application for instrumentalists looking to jam along with his latest jazz album. Now, everyone can be his student. – | Photo courtesy of Peter Erskine
“I used to joke that if someone needed two credits — and it’s a toss up between medieval German literature and beginning drumming —it’s kind of a no-brainer,” said Peter Erskine, professor of jazz studies for the Thornton School of Music.
Erskine not only understands the appeal of music to younger generations but is participating in the creation of new media to enhance his students’ experience with his new Apple application “Erskine Joy Luck PlayAlong,” which allows its user to follow the instrumentation and play along with his jazz album Joy Luck.
The application distinguishes itself from other minus-one offerings by providing isolated stems for individual instruments. Karaoke, for example, is a popular music-minus-one offering limited in that only the voice is replaced. Likewise, Guitar Hero simply removes the guitar track. Additionally, both of these platforms remove the technicality from playing music. With Erskine’s app, practicing musicians can substitute Erskine’s studio recorded bass, drums or keyboard for their own live instruments using the original sheet music for guidance.
With his own 15-year-old record label, Fuzzy Music, Erskine has the artistic and financial freedom to pursue his own creative visions. For his latest project, Erskine decided to reach out to a diverse team of musicians and after teaming up with pianist Vardan Ovsepian and his nephew, electric bassist Damian Erskine, the jazz CD Joy Luck was born.
But through a new development, the album didn’t abide by normal recording protocol.
“We made this album in contrast to a lot of the other recordings I’ve done, where all of the instruments are in the same room. We did this in such a way that we could separate each instrument and its performance from the others so that we could create a music-minus-one play-along product,” said Erskine in regard to the app developed for iPhone and iPad by drummer Lucas Ives.
By combining his  jazz album with Apple software, Erskine’s project took on a second dimension. “Erskine Joy Luck PlayAlong” rejects the passive listening experience, providing instead a platform that invites active musical engagement.
Erskine should be praised for his own intrinsic curiosity, but the professor never fails to give credit where credit is due. When plans for a mobile application began materializing in Erskine’s head, Erskine turned to advice from those who use apps most — his Thornton students.
“I began asking my students at USC, ‘What’s the magic number to buy an app?’ Everyone said $4.99 — any more than that would give them pause.”
Erskine’s natural reaction to this: “All right, cool. No one’s going to get rich from this.”
But profit was not Erskine’s ultimate goal, anyway.
“It looked like the app store represented a new paradigm in getting music out to people,” Erskine said. “The app store provided inspiration for us to create musical tools not only for our students but for students all over the place. This is a good branding and representation of some of what we do at USC.”
The jazz studies professor is certainly proud about Thornton’s contribution to USC’s initiative to incorporate technology into formal education. Erskine cites Thornton’s popular music program and introductory drumming class MPPM 240 as prime examples of technology at work in the music curriculum.
Erskine might in fact be one of the most qualified people in the music world to teach such courses because of his affinity for technology and his industry experience.
“Electronics and music technology play a very big role in what we do in music technology courses. The dean gives full support to requiring drum proficiency to all pop music majors,” Erskine said. “In contemporary American music, the drums are really the grandfather of everything that’s going on.”
Still, even though Erskine raves about the benefits of technology in the classroom, he wants his students to know that there’s more to music than an iPad and a computer — true artistry happens through a mastery of the instrument on top of an openness to technological advancement.
“I’m happy to say that I see that happening more and more at USC — the blend of old and new, embracing technology but also realizing that what we do is a human art,” Erskine said.
Regarding the future of the music industry, Erskine thinks that the pendulum will swing in the right direction if musicians recognize that instantaneous access to music-related videos, archives and programs can spoil the artist.
“The challenge is in reminding ourselves and each other how magical playing an instrument is and how we can’t forget the importance of a piece of paper and a pencil and what it’s like to really sit with one piece of music,” Erskine said.
Erskine’s “warning hashtag,” as he calls it: “Don’t get lost in Candyland here. You have to focus on the instrument.”
Erskine, nevertheless, is clearly a believer in exploring and creating new technologies to amplify the musical experience. His recent album-app combination exemplifies forward thinking in today’s music industry and a type of adaptation necessary for artists and bands to survive.
“It’s an exciting, daunting time to be a musician because the relationship between the musician and the audience is changing every day thanks to technology,” Erskine said. “We can spend our days banging our heads against the wall, agonizing over the change, or try to embrace it in some positive way.”
“Erskine Joy Luck PlayAlong,” ….. kinda’ like Kareoke for drummers?

A recent poll conducted by the Policy Analysis for California Education and Rossier School of Education showed that California voters, by a slight majority, would support an increase in sales and income taxes in order to reduce budget cuts to public education.
California Proposition 30, which will be on the ballot in November, would increase the sales tax rate by ¼ cent per dollar for four years and the personal income tax rate for those with incomes of more than $250,000 for seven years.
“If it passes, the state will receive several billion dollars in additional revenue that will help prevent further cuts to education and other areas,” said Dominic Brewer, vice dean of research in partnerships and globalization at Rossier. “The state budget has essentially been built on the assumption that the extra revenue will be there, so there will be a scramble to identify new cuts if Prop. 30 fails.”
If passed, the proposition is projected to raise about $6 billion in additional annual state revenues for the next seven years. If the measure is rejected, the 2012-13 state budget would be reduced by $6 billion.
According to the poll, about 55 percent of Californians support Proposition 30 while 36 percent oppose it.
When opposition arguments to the measure were presented, however, poll respondents tended to agree with them more specifically. About 49 percent of people believe that state politicians should decrease wasteful spending before raising taxes.
“It’s hard for skeptical voters, who think there is still wasteful spending and too much state control of schools, to see specific examples of how the funds get used,” Brewer said. “Giving real examples for why more revenue is needed now will be essential — a general appeal isn’t likely to work.”
Some USC students said neither of these options seems especially appealing because the state of the budget has not left any easy choices.
“When you’re just hearing about these things without really being in politics, what you hear is that there are multiple taxes on the ballot,” said Cat Shieh, a junior majoring in political science who works for the Unruh Institute of Politics. “Who likes taxes? Nobody.”
The measure would increase personal income tax rates for the top three income tax brackets, consisting of those who make more than $250,000 annually. The exact sales tax rate increase would differ by locality. The average sales tax rate is  currently 8.13 percent.
“Everybody has a piece in this because that’s what separating the three tax brackets does,” Shieh said. “That will make the issue a little less partisan because everyone understands the situation at hand with the budget and everybody would have to be a part of the solution.”
California voters tend to agree that improvements need to be made to an education system that has dealt with drastic cuts in recent years. When asked what grade they would give public schools in the state, many respondents to the poll said that they would give their local schools a C.
If Prop. 30 passes, voters would most like to see programs that have been cut restored to schools and future budget cuts prevented. If the tax initiative fails, those polled said that they would prefer to deal with the budget reduction by eliminating transportation of students to schools, increasing class sizes and shortening the school year.
“There will be limited additional funding for state services, including education, for a period of time,” said Lawrence Picus, vice dean for faculty affairs at Rossier, on the implications of passing Prop. 30. “That will help limit the impact of state budget deficits on the provision of important government services to children and to others across the state. If it does not pass, school districts will have to make further cuts in their budgets in the middle of the school year.”
Though many said voters will face a tough choice in November, some experts said they believe the poll results will prove true.
“The state remains in a severe budget crisis despite years of sustained cuts to public services,” said Morgan Polikoff, assistant professor of education at Rossier. “Without the money, even more draconian cuts will have to be made. Perhaps voters are coming around to the idea that starving the state leads to worse results for everyone.”

This article originally appeared in the print edition of the 1969 Summer Trojan.
“Three-hundred feet. Down 3 ½, 47 forward. One minute, 1 ½ down, 70. Altitude velocity light. 15 forward. Coming down nicely. Two-hundred feet…
“Down 2 ½. Forward. Kicking up some dust. Big shadow. For 4 forward; 4 forward drifting to the right a little. Down one-half. Thirty seconds.”
And then, “One small step for man, one giant leap for mankind.” These were the words Command Pilot Neil Armstrong, one-time graduate student at USC, spoke a she stepped onto the surface of the moon Sunday to explore its bleak, forbidding crust in man’s first visit to another celestial body. The time was 7:56 p.m., PDT, as he swung his left boot to the surface of the moon to become the first man to set foot on the lunar surface.
About 20 minutes later Edwin E. Aldrin Jr. followed Armstrong’s path down the ladder from the spaceship Eagle and began collecting rocks to bring back to earth.
The third of the three-men Apollo crew was waiting and listening in lunar orbit. Michael Collins, command module pilot, has but one major duty — to keep Apollo 11 orbiting the moon.
Then came the Kangaroo Hop. Armstrong and Aldrin may have touched off the latest fad in dancing as they took advantage of losing 5/6ths of their weight and began testing the moon’s gravitational pull.
Armstrong could have missed his destiny — to become the first man to set foot on the moon — as the result of half a dozen close calls.
In Korea he crashed his Panther jet behind enemy lines, but escaped a day later.
As a civilian pilot in 1962, he plummeted uncontrollably toward earth in his X-15 when the rocket engine failed to start, but it caught on just in time.
As commander of Gemini 8 in 1966, he had to abort the scheduled three-day flight after ten hours when a short circuit threw the spacecraft’s thrusters out of control.
Last summer he had to eject from a lunar-landing research vehicle at an altitude of only 100ft. when it spun out of control and crashed.
Buzz Aldrin might have never become an astronaut at all but for his persistence, determination and good fortune.
He was turned down when he first applied in 1962. NASA regulations at the time demanded that astronauts be graduate test pilots. Aldrin was a veteran fighter pilot (two MIGs destroyed, one damaged in 66 Korean missions for the Air Force).
The next year, after the regulations had been eased to let in combat pilots with more than 1,000 hours of experience flying jets, Aldrin was accepted.
Michael Collins owes his couch on the moonship to bad health. He was to have been a member of the Apollo 8 crew, which made man’s first orbits around the moon last Christmas. A paralyzing bone spur in the neck sent him to the hospital in June, 1968, for a risky operation. Bill Anders took his place. The surgery was a complete success, and Collins was back on full flight status by last November. It was much too late for him to resume his original place with the Apollo 8 crew — but it meant he would join the Apollo 11.
Searching back through the files in the registrar’s office here, one can stumble across the name Neil Armstrong. It seems that while he was a civilian test pilot at Edwards Air Force Base from 1955-60, Armstrong took graduate courses in engineering which USC professors taught at the base. Armstrong completed almost all requirements for a master’s degree in engineering for USC before he was transferred from the base.
And so, once again USC identifies with a national fete — a fete for all of mankind. Pat Nixon, Herb Klein, Ron Zeigler, Walter Schirra, and now Neil Armstrong. Who next will descend on the world from the halls of Troy?
I remember as a student attending a session in Bovard auditorium to hear Neil Armstrong deliver an oral presentation of a paper he had written on how to land the lunar module. I’ve always wondered, who graded his paper?

Neil Armstrong, who became an American icon as the first man to set foot on the moon, died Saturday, weeks after heart surgery. He was 82.
Advice · Neil Armstrong spoke to graduates about the importance of strong moral principles in his 2005 commencement address at USC. – Photo by Lee Salem
The former astronaut underwent cardiac bypass surgery earlier this month, just two days following his birthday.
Armstrong, who attended USC for graduate school, was the commander of Apollo 11 when he planted the American flag on the moon’s soil July 20, 1969.
“That’s one step for [a] man, one giant leap for mankind,” he famously radioed back to Earth.
In 1970, Armstrong received a master of science in aerospace engineering. Though Armstrong was a few units short of graduating, Richard Kaplan, an aerospace professor at the time, recalls the university awarding him directed research credit for walking on the moon.
“It made it really hard for the next guy who did directed research,” Kaplan said. “Where was he going to walk?”
In addition to his professional achievements, Armstrong was remembered for exemplary character, including his humility and dedication to public service.
“Honor his example of service, accomplishment and modesty, and the next time you walk outside on a clear night and see the moon smiling down at you, think of Neil Armstrong and give him a wink,” his family said in a statement released Sunday.
Though Armstrong did not remain involved with the university after he graduated, he came back in 2005 to deliver a commencement speech in which he urged graduates to develop strong values and principles of their own.
“You can lose your health to illness or accident,” he said. “You can lose your wealth to all manner of unpredictable sources. What are not easily stolen from you without your cooperation are your principles and your values. They are your most important possessions and, if carefully selected and nurtured, will well serve you and your fellow man.”
Kaplan said both Armstrong and Apollo 11 crewmember Buzz Aldrin were aware of their mission’s significance and changed by it.
“They were both very dignified and thoughtful people,” Kaplan said. “It was something in their life that I think made them much more introspective.”
Neil Alden Armstrong was born on Aug. 5, 1930 in Wapakoneta, Ohio. In 1947, Armstrong enrolled at Purdue University as an aeronautical engineering student on a Navy scholarship. Two years later, he interrupted his studies to serve as a pilot in the Korean War, flying 78 combat missions.
Armstrong first enrolled at USC in 1955, according to assistant registrar James Feigert. He took courses through the university’s aerospace program at Edwards Air Force Base.
After landing on the moon, Armstrong continued working at NASA as deputy associate director for aeronautics until 1971. He later taught at the University of Cincinnati as a professor of aerospace engineering and became the chairman of computing technologies for Aviation, Inc.
Yannis Yortsos, dean of the Viterbi School of Engineering, said Armstrong is an alumnus who should inspire students to think innovatively.
“When you look back, you want the same type of spirit to be rejuvenated today and to help people imagine in the same direction as people imagined [then],” Yortsos said.
Kaplan said Armstrong’s passing reflects the passing of an era.
“We did so many wonderful things in those days and when the heroes of those times are gone you wonder who is going to replace them,” Kaplan said.
A private service is planned in Cincinnati on Friday.

As students flocked to the University Park Campus for the first day of classes Monday, new, portable bike lanes flanking Trousdale Parkway prompted varied reactions from students.
Traffic control · Students tested out the new bike lanes on Trousdale Parkway on the first day of classes for the fall semester Monday. According to Student Affairs, the lanes are meant to reduce collisions. – Ani Kolangian | Daily Trojan
 
Part of a joint project by USC Student Affairs and Undergraduate Student Government, the bike lanes are intended to enable students to bike up and down Trousdale without interfering with pedestrian traffic.
An email sent to students by Student Affairs mentions that the new bike lanes are the result of the “We are Considerate. We Are USC.” campaign started in 2011.
“The goal is to make the campus more hospitable to bikers and to benefit the students on campus,” said Michael Jackson, vice president of student affairs.
If these lanes prove successful, USC hopes to expand the bike lanes to thoroughfares, such as Childs and Watt ways.
“Student Affairs is excited about the new bike lanes and hopes this new experiment will be the first step in a broader solution to help keep USC a bicycle and pedestrian friendly campus,” said Tom Studdert, director at USC Orientation Programs. “This goes a long way in helping us maintain safety for all Trojans, particularly in the center of campus.”
USG President Mikey Geragos said USG became interested in bike lanes because of campus safety.
“The issue of bike safety on campus came to my attention this summer,” Geragos said. “While the bike lanes are by no means the only solution to this issue on campus, we hope that they work.”
For bikers around the university, these bike lanes provide a much-needed departure from Trousdale before its makeover this summer.
“Biking on Trousdale, especially when school starts, is really tough and kind of crazy,” Adrian Pedroza, a sophomore majoring in psychology. “I’ve even seen head-on collisions.”
A survey conducted by bikeusc.org, a campus cycling information group, gave a factual basis for the new bike lanes. The study reported that nearly 25 percent of USC’s undergraduate student body has had a collision with a bike in the past year.
The same survey also showed 20 percent of undergraduate students had no regular cycling experience prior to biking on campus, suggesting pedestrian unfamiliarity with bicycles, coupled with rider inexperience, often results in the frequent collisions on campus.
Last week, Dept. of Public Safety officers placed large portable metal dividers on Trousdale and urged pedestrians to stay out of bike lanes.
Several days after first sightings of the dividers, construction crews painted permanent bike icons on the sides of Trousdale. These sharrows, or shared-lane markings, coupled with the metal dividers, are intended to decrease the risk factor in having bicyclists and pedestrians share walkways.
In the past, campus cyclists like Pedroza found themselves in the way of pedestrians; they were also forbidden to ride on Trousdale during peak hours. Though Student Affairs said the peak hours rule and other safety precautions are still in effect, many confused travelers have needed DPS officers to inform about the new lanes and how to use them.
“It might take a little while for people to get used to using the bike lanes, but overall, it should help promote pedestrian safety,” said Selena Ng, a freshman majoring in business administration.
Though the project is in its preliminary stages of development, — evident by the placement of the bike lanes on only one campus walkway — Student Affairs hopes that the lanes will foster a more orderly and safer environment for pedestrians and cyclists.
Nicole Poritzky, an undeclared freshman, said the lanes made walking to class during peak hours easier for pedestrians.
“It’s a good idea and makes for safer travelling,” Poritzky said. “Now that I see how busy [Trousdale] can be at rush hour, I’m really glad there’s a system in place.”
Not all, however, are so optimistic. Matthew Lopez, a sophomore majoring in history, likes the lanes but thinks they could be marked better.
“I’m an aimless walker, so I like that it keeps me from wandering into bikers’ paths,” Lopez said. “I do think that the lane [boundaries] could be more clear, because a lot of people seemed confused.”

We begin this academic year boasting a football team poised to sweep the national championship and bring in millions of dollars for USC.
But even on our spirited college campus, many students challenge the merit of athletic programs, adding to a growing debate over the place of athletics in an academic atmosphere.
Lener Jimenez | Daily Trojan
 
Across the nation, student-athletes are used as scapegoats for unfair admissions practices and a rising sense of anti-intellectualism on college campuses. Athletic programs, however, should no longer be thought of as contradictory to a university’s academic pursuits, but instead as complements to the inherent goals of a university.
Unfortunately, the criticism comes from those who know the academic goals of a university best. In a blog post from The New York Times, University of Notre Dame professor Gary Gutting accused college athletes and programs of catalyzing an anti-intellectual culture on American college campuses. Gutting argues that the college athlete does not treat his or her sport as a secondary, co-curricular activity, but as his or her main focus, which “marginaliz[es]” academics.
Indeed, many athletes spend more time preparing for their sports than they spend concentrating on schoolwork. A 2011 NCAA study found that Division I baseball players devote 42.1 hours a week to their sport during the spring season — 10.4 hours more than they spend on academic work. For DI football players, the study found that the number of weekly hours spent solely on sports is even higher.
At USC, athletes are certainly given an abundance of resources to help them succeed on the field and inside the classroom. Some Trojans even point to the recently completed McKay Center, created in the hopes of fostering both academic and athletic pursuits, as an example of university irresponsibility. After all, the building’s $70 million construction cost could cover one semester’s full tuition for more than 3,300 USC students.
It’s easy to lambast this degree of funding without examining a fuller picture. USC invests in all of its programs to ensure the best faculty and facilities are available for students. To single out athletics as undeserving of this treatment begs the question: Are athletics truly co-curricular, or do they deserve to be recognized as curriculum themselves?
It’s clear that many student-athletes are athletes first and students second. But perhaps the two groupings aren’t as mutually exclusive as they are thought to be. Becoming an accomplished athlete is a process reached through time, study and perseverance — a development path shared by all ambitious USC students.
Our school’s athletes should be no less admired than our talented artists, actors, engineers or businessmen. Each student’s journey demands a significant level of skill and dedication that can be honed in college. USC is well-regarded for its ability to help students excel in a variety of technical as well as liberal arts areas of interest, such as our film, theater and fine arts programs — all ranked among the highest of their kind in the country.
The goal of a college education is to prepare students to excel in their chosen areas of interest. By every standard, USC’s athletic program is aligned with the goals of our university.
 
Ryan Townsend is a sophomore majoring in business administration. His column, “The Blame Game,” runs Tuesdays.
Athletics should not get all the blame. But the athletics game has got out of control in the United States. Penn state even had a statue of its coach! 
Universities should focus on what universities do: study, research, and debate.
This is a very well written and thought out opinion piece. As a mother of a 15 year old daughter who plays competitive soccer and hopes to play in College someday, your points are all well said. It is not easy to be a top athlete and student trying to gain entrance in a top university. Athletes work very hard, both physically and mentally, to be at the top of their game. Add to that the intense pressure to be a top student and get good grades, it is no walk in the park. Having brains is to be applauded, no doubt, but to have brains and athletic attributes, to graduate (hopefully) from a top ranked university, well, that’s priceless.
Well said. I have said this for years.
[…] For example, Bradbury’s antagonist goes on about filling students “so damned full of ‘facts’ they feel stuffed, but absolutely ‘brilliant’ with information.” Sound familiar? Searching the news on any given day will reveal complaints of how students regurgitate rather than understand. In Bradbury’s characters’ world, higher education is cranking out more athletes than creatives and intellectuals. Maybe that sounds familiar also? It should: this is another hot topic of debate in higher education, with people on both sides of the table. […]

The First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution guarantees the freedom of the press.
In college campuses around the country, student newspapers and magazines operate under the idea that all press is free, including their own work. Recent events at the University of Georgia, however, highlight how press freedom is hardly safe from attack.
Earlier this month, Polina Marinova, editor in chief of the university’s student-run paper The Red & Black, resigned and walked out of the office in protest after the university tried to gain editorial control over the publication. The paper’s editorial board joined her and launched a blog called Red and Dead to demand a reversal of the university’s policies and publish their own articles outside of The Red & Black.
Among the encroachments on the paper’s independence, Marinova noted that someone on the Board of Directors called for The Red & Black to have a change in the amount of “good and bad” content. What exactly was bad content?
The board member described it as “[c]ontent that catches people or organizations doing bad things. I guess this is ‘journalism.’ If in question, have more GOOD than BAD.”
The board also pushed to have a professional adviser become the editorial director, which would give individual prior review on what the paper published. That means that a hired, paid member of the university would be able to tell the student staff what could and could not run inside the paper, giving the university veto power over what students worked on. And the university did this without any input from the students who staff the paper.
The Red & Black’s walkout was the right thing to do.
Journalism isn’t public relations. Journalists are not there to serve as propaganda machines and to simply regurgitate positive news about institutions.
What the University of Georgia tried to do is an affront to student journalism. The Red & Black, like many other college newspapers, is explicitly student-run. It’s an independent and legitimate news publication.
There might be some idea that because its journalists are students they don’t have the same rights or authority on matters as journalists who work on a full-time basis. But students work hard, turn out stories and see them published. They strive to seek truth and report it, as the Society of Professional Journalists’ code of ethics dictates.
Student journalists are legitimate journalists, and to have prior review and other forms of censorship forced onto them is an affront to their freedom as press.
And as for the board member putting quotation marks around journalism to describe a body that exposes misconduct or corruption, that doesn’t deserve quotations as if it’s some dismissible idea. That’s what journalism is.
George Orwell once said, “Journalism is printing what someone else does not want printed: everything else is public relations.”
Downplaying that kind of reporting does more harm than good in the long run, as many cases of misconduct could go unchecked.
This kind of censorship shouldn’t happen, but it does, so at the very least it’s good that student journalists fight back and take action to protect their independence.
And if anything, this incident shows that the institutions that try to rein in student press can’t keep up with the students. Marinova and the other editors organized quickly, built a strong online presence and reached out to other publications and journalism groups to share their story. The university was on the defensive and could not keep up.
There is a happy ending here: the staff of The Red & Black managed to reach an agreement with the University of Georgia to stop the changes, and Marinova and other editors are back in their old positions. The former Red and Dead staff are continuing to push for a lack of censorship, and they did show the university that they won’t simply stand back and lose control of their paper.
What the editorial board of The Red & Black, and all of the other staff members who joined them, did is inspiring.
Journalists, whether they’re students or otherwise, should never have to fight for freedom of the press. But since they do, it is good to know that they don’t stand back and let others trample over them.

Forgive the typos in the previous message.  Lost my eyeglasses, using old ones.
We submitted a text link to be run in the Daily Trojan that reads:  HOLOCAUST HISTORY;  The kIssue of Academic Conformaty. The link leads to the text of a talk I gave at the Teheran Holocaust Conference in December 2006. The title of the talk is The Irrational Vocabulary of the American Professorial Class with Regard to the Holocaust Question.
The ad was rejected by The Trojan. No specific reason. It would appear that the issue of Academic Conformaty has been successful with the editgorial staff of The Trojan. It is not a matter to leave to the advertising department. If any Trojan readers have any sound reasons, based on the text of the talk itself, for not wanting it to be seen by USC students, I would like to know what they are.
The Trojan rejects (all) advertisements from the Committee for Open Debate on the Holocaust because of pressure from the Anti-Defamation League/Hillel and its captive USC administration.
These are PAID ADS, not editorial content, and yes, it is entirely within The Trojan’s rights to pick and choose whom they will accept money from for what ads. Freedom of speech, after all does NOT extend to advertisers, at least not in The Trojan. The Trojan (or its handlers) does NOT want open debate on THAT subject.
And what others? No way to tell, is there?
Buffitt’s idea has merit!  Getting a fractured American public to agree to make such demands on Congress is questionable.  Getting Congress to take action, even as a beginning, is more questionable.  We’ll never know until this gets support from the American public, so pass it on with good wishes.
Warren  Buffett, in a recent interview with CNBC, offers one
of the best quotes  about the debt ceiling:
“I could end the deficit in 5 minutes,” he told CNBC. “You  just
  pass a  law that says that anytime there is a deficit of  more
  than 3% of  GDP, all sitting members of Congress are  ineligible
  for re-election.
  The 26th amendment (granting the right to vote for 18  year-olds)
  took only 3 months & 8 days to be ratified!  Why?  Simple!
  The people demanded it. That was in 1971 – before computers,
e-mail, cell phones, etc.
  Of the 27 amendments to the Constitution, seven (7) took one (1)  year
  or less to become the law of the land – all because of public  pressure.
  Warren Buffet is asking each addressee to forward this email  to
  a minimum of twenty people on their address list; in turn  ask
  each of those to do likewise.
  In three days, most people
in The United States of America  will
  have the message.  This is one idea that really should be  passed
  around.
Congressional  Reform Act of  2012   
 1. No  Tenure / No Pension.
  A Congressman/woman collects a salary
while in office and receives  no
  pay when they’re out of office.
 2.   Congress (past, present & future) participates in  Social
   Security.
  All funds in the Congressional retirement fund move to  the
  Social Security system immediately. All future funds flow  into
  the Social Security system, and Congress participates with
the American people. It may not be used for any other  purpose.
 3. Congress  can purchase their own retirement plan,  just as  all
Americans do.
4. Congress  will no longer vote themselves a pay raise.
  Congressional pay will rise by the lower of CPI or  3%.
5. Congress  loses their current health care system and
  participates in the same health care system as the American  people.
 6. Congress  must equally abide by all laws they impose on the
  American people.
    7. All  contracts with past and
present Congressmen/women are  void
  effective 12/1/12. The American people did not make  this
  contract with Congressmen/women.
  Congress made all these contracts for themselves. Serving  in
  Congress is an honor, not a career. The Founding  Fathers
  envisioned citizen legislators, so ours should serve  their
  term(s), then go home and back to work.
  If each person contacts a minimum of twenty people then it  will
  only take three days for most people (in the U.S. ) to  receive
  the message.  Don’t you think it’s  time?
THIS  IS HOW YOU FIX CONGRESS!
I think it’s important to note that the The Red & Black is run by an independent 501(c)(3)
corporation with its own self-perpetuating board of directors, not appointed
by or controlled by the University of Georgia.  So your assertion in the ninth paragraph, “What the University of Georgia tried to do is an affront to student journalism,” is wrong.  The members of that board
are Georgia publishers, editors and other businesspeople, many of them UGA
alumni and former Red & Black staffers.  It is that board of directors that
has been in dispute with the student staff, not the university.  The Red &
Black has been entirely independent of the University of Georgia since 1980.  I just wanted to set the record straight.
Thank you,

Yes, and the Federal Reserve is NOT part of the US government.
It isn’t – you can look it up. The Fed is owned and operated by its member banks.

During the 2008 election season, political mumblings about who supported whom and for what reason quickly led to lunchtime debates, between-class conversations, public demonstrations and even drinking games.
Xingzhou Zhu | Daily Trojan
At a community as diverse as USC, such mumblings take on new meaning.
During this year’s “election semester,” students are presented with the biggest opportunity to explore a huge range of beliefs, values and ideals in order to form their own.
Yet amid the never-ending flow of opposition and polarization that defines politics today, it is difficult to know exactly where to stand.
Two years ago, MSNBC’s Nightly News broadcasted an interview with former President Jimmy Carter, who was quoted as saying that the United States was more polarized then (in 2010) than during the Civil War.
Carter’s quote could also be extended beyond the red and blue states to the current schism in Washington.
In D.C., a microcosm of the country as a whole, there exist a few drastically different ideologies regarding which direction the nation needs to go next.
But instead of actively seeking to bridge these differences and arrive at a compromise, political parties sling mud at each other, each hoping they will emerge from the metaphorical war as the victor.
Between an increasingly polarized Congress, attack ads and seemingly contradictory information coming from all directions, it can be difficult for voters to make informed judgments and decisions.
Yet college students are in a place where many differences — in backgrounds, interests, languages, cultures — collide and merge instead of clash and divide.
Do you think a certain way because of how you were raised or because of what has happened to you? Do you form your opinions because of where you are from?
Regardless of the reason, being exposed from students of all walks of life can take your political and personal beliefs in a fresh direction.
This is one of the biggest advantages of being a college student during the election — drawing from the experience and knowledge of others to learn about who you are and what you believe in.
Many students, however, will miss out on this rare opportunity.
Some might forgo researching the candidates, just voting because they have the opportunity to do so.
Some might skip the election entirely for various reasons — apathy, lack of knowledge, mistrust of the government or thinking one vote out of a million won’t change the current state of our country. Perhaps it won’t.
On a deeper level, however, voting is a rite of passage, an opportunity to shape the country’s future and your own.
By deciding to go to college, you are deciding to become a member of an elite group, joining some of the most educated people in the country.
Unequivocally, it is a chance to learn more, do more and be more than you ever thought you would be.
Even though politics can be annoying and the arguments unnerving, election season is the most exciting time to be a college student.
Take advantage of that.

Have guts. Don’t let your peers force you to follow The Herd Mentality of college life. Stand up for what’s right….not for what’s “popular” or trendy or “accepted” by the ignorant masses. Vote for the Romney Ryan ticket and do something GOOD for your country.

A few weeks ago my friend and fellow editor, Joey Kaufman, struck Tumblr gold.
There’s a post on the editorial-oriented blog Family Business (fambusiness.tumblr.com) titled “The Aughts Internet Is Over.” Joey found it and shared it on Facebook. I read it, hit the like button and unliked it — just so I could like it again.
I liked it — loved it — because the author rants about the difference between writers and at-home observers.
“Most internet writers were empowered by the internet’s growth last decade, when websites emerged as the preeminent vehicles for entertainment, news and commentary,” the author writes. “Personal blogs, in particular, anointed a new class of informed, passionate people who could suddenly fashion themselves as writers and pundits. With nothing more than a hyperlink, an embedded YouTube video, or a photograph lifted from somewhere else, anyone could publish opinions, serve as a filter and attempt to lead a conversation.”
Sound familiar? As readers in the digital age, we’re constantly being bombarded by news sites that aggregate and pimp, aggregate and pimp. (Let’s be clear: We’re talking about pimping brands — and image.)
The DT does that, too, and I don’t think there’s anything wrong with it. Well, except for the fact that pimping and aggregating gets boring and redundant really quickly.
As the Family Business writer notes, there is a way to stick out. For writers, the author says reporting is a good start. I couldn’t agree more.
The DT has been around for 100 years and reporting has been the constant that has kept us relevant as an on-campus news service.
We have a total staff of more than 200 writers. When we go out to report a story, we’re not repackaging the news; we’re bringing you back something real — something with a unique, personal edge.
Two lines, in particular, sum up what I want to push this semester:
“Give me fewer content aggregators masquerading as ‘writers’; fewer people who spend most of their lives in front of the television, computer, or smart phone and write like they only know other people doing the same. Instead, find talent — be it a good blogger or an actual investigative journalist (‘investigative’ meaning everything from Watergate to a person who knows what just happened at the community garden) — and tell that person to go cover something.”
USC is our community garden, and there’s going to be lots growing here, from the reverberation of the presidential election to critical issues on the state political level to the successes and missed opportunities of the USC community.
I want DT staffers to be the good bloggers and investigative reporters you wake up wanting to read.
And I know we can do that. We have writers on staff that are hungry for campus news, we have hard-hitting editorials coming your way, we have a Lifestyle section that is gunning to keep you in the know (both on and off campus) and we have a sports team fighting to cover the exploits of the Trojans and the Women of Troy.
As editor in chief, my goal is to facilitate real discussion on campus — not to endorse the Internet-age bad habit of sharing and retweeting recycled content and storylines. We’re covering the community garden — and if we can successfully catalyze a conversation on campus, then we’re doing our job.
Though the DT might not always have the sexiest of storylines, we’re still going to be focusing on what matters and relates to you, the students.
I want the DT to be the sounding board for USC. I want us to be relevant to you. I want our papers to crowd your desk at home or in your dorm room.
I want — and maybe this is pushing it — our website to be bookmarked on your Internet browsers.
But for that to happen, we’ll need to hear from you and we’ll need you to hold us accountable.
Tell us what you want covered. Tell us what you want more of. And — perhaps most importantly — tell us what we’re doing wrong and why.
 
Editor in Chief Sean Fitz-Gerald is a senior majoring in English. He can be reached at dtrojan@usc.edu.
Hear hear. Good stuff, Sean. Excited to see the DT’s work this semester.
