Adoree’ Jackson, the jack-of-all-trades who wowed USC fans for three seasons on offense, defense and special teams, now has an NFL home.
Jackson was selected 18th overall by the Tennessee Titans in the NFL Draft on Thursday, the first true cornerback in USC history to be selected in the first round and the first USC defensive back to be a first round pick since Troy Polamalu in 2003. Jackson also extends USC’s record of first round draft picks to 80.
Jackson won the Jim Thorpe Award last season as the nation’s top defensive back, recording five interceptions and 11 pass break-ups. But he also dazzled as a punt and kick returner and occasionally on offense. Jackson’s 2,045 kick return yards is a USC record. He scored four times on special teams last season, twice on kick returns and twice on punt returns.
He punctuated his USC career last season with a historic performance against Notre Dame in his final home game at the Coliseum. Jackson caught a touchdown pass and also returned both a punt and kickoff for touchdowns.
The Belleville, IL native was named a Freshman All-American and Pac-12 Defensive Rookie of the Year in his first season and was a first-team All-Pac-12 defensive back as a sophomore.
“Ain’t it a blessing,” Jackson tweeted on Thursday evening.
Jackson, who is 5-foot-10 and 186 pounds, will join Marcus Mariotta and a Titans team that will likely utilize him immediately as a cornerback. Jackson has drawn comparisons to the Houston Texans’ Jonathan Joseph and the Cincinnati Bengals’ Adam Jones.

Natalie Yee | Daily Trojan
I took over as the editorial director of the Daily Trojan in the third week of Spring 2017 after one week of shadowing my predecessor. At the beginning of the semester, I was preparing for my new role as an editorial assistant; my first big surprise on the Daily Trojan’s staff came when I learned my editor would be stepping down, and I was encouraged to interview to take his place.
I have no intention of making this entry of “Behind the Desk” into a quasi-autobiography, but for some context, I am the kind of person who finds fulfillment in keeping busy. That being said, the jobs and extracurriculars I’ve involved myself with all share one thing — I do them because I love them, and I wouldn’t do them if I didn’t love them. That’s why I’ve always been a writer — first for my high school newspaper beginning in my junior year, and then for numerous internet news publications over the past two years — because I cannot emphasize this enough: I love writing.
In this sense, I’ve never considered myself an ambitious person, but a hedonistic one. I’ve never perceived myself as a leader, or anything other than a girl who loves having opinions and loves writing about them. Stepping up and becoming an editor was a very uncomfortable idea for me.
When I was offered the position, I was astounded that people I had so much respect and admiration for saw potential in me that I never believed existed. I simply didn’t see what our editor-in-chief, Danni Wang, or our managing editor, Sonali Seth, saw in me, but I had so much respect for their opinions that I trusted them and nervously accepted the offer.
The only two things I’ve ever known for certain about myself are that, first, as I’ve previously, emphatically noted, I love writing, and second, that I am woefully inept at anything involving art and aesthetics. You can imagine my surprise at this point in the semester, that Adobe InDesign and the basics of Photoshop are second nature to me as I spend roughly 25 hours a week plopped in front of an oversized Mac desktop, laying out the editorial pages. 
And many more surprises have since been scattered throughout my semester as your editorial director.
Put simply, I was initially so plagued with self-doubt that at the beginning, I made it a goal to do one thing: everything and anything that I was told to. But the ultimate lesson I learned, not immediately but gradually, is that respect is not always about sweeping, blind agreement. In the newsroom every day, I watch as crucial decisions about our content and journalistic practices spring from sometimes contentious debate among my co and managing editors, people with such impressive backgrounds in journalism, diverse opinions and, above all, strong, mutual respect for each other. 
And the more I’ve learned about the Daily Trojan from sitting in the editorial director’s chair, the more inspired I’ve been to step out of my comfort zone and try to involve myself in the dialogues and decision-making. Respect isn’t about always agreeing; it’s about genuinely wanting to collaborate, have discussions, understand each other and produce the best work we can.
In the Daily Trojan’s newsroom, we share a passion for campus affairs, for being in the know and understanding what is going on around ourselves and around our peers, for leading discussion and following it. That is what unites us, and that is what’s placed us all in this room. But that being said, campus affairs are by no means the only things we discuss. Everyone brings their own special interests and unique backgrounds to the table. Whether the topic is dog spotting, the Trump administration gaffe of the day, Fifth Harmony, Planned Parenthood funding, the Warriors, the latest viral meme or how freaking life-changing podcasts are (for the 107th time, Terry, I’ll listen to some, eventually), the conversation is never dull, and no topic is ever off the table — though I could certainly go with less CupcakKe lyrics (I’m looking at you, Tomás).
At the end of the day, my biggest surprise from working as an editor this semester, as cliche as it sounds, is how much more I’ve learned in this new room than in any lecture hall here at USC. Sure, I’ve learned a lot about journalism, reporting and collaboration, but the most important lesson I’ve learned is pretty personal and unacademic. 
That is, you can simultaneously be proud and humble — and not at all arrogant. Pride is knowing that you’re on the right path and still getting there, but arrogance is when you think you’re there. It’s where you stop pushing yourself, cease to tinker with new ideas — new layouts and designs, new angles and editorial approaches, new anythings. 
At the Daily Trojan, we are incredibly proud of the work we produce, but we are also humble and acknowledge all the work that still must be done. We are constantly striving toward higher standards because we know we’re on the right path — but we also know we’re still getting there.
And as my semester as your editorial director draws to a close, I can honestly say that I’m proud of the job I’ve done. I’m proud of the columns I’ve written, the editorial boards I’ve contributed to, the stories I’ve pitched, assigned and edited and the pages I’ve made, all with the patient guidance of Danni and Sonali, who have been there for me every day to answer my ceaseless, stupid questions and support me through the general ups and downs of my first year of college.
But simultaneously, I am humbled to dust by the kindness I’ve been shown, the support and encouragement I’ve received regarding both my work and personal life, from my co-editors. And in my humble opinion, there’s no place I’d rather be, no people I’d rather work with.

Lucky. Looking back, that’s the only way that head women’s tennis coach Richard Gallien can describe his 22 years at USC.
In his time as a Trojan coach, Gallien earned accolades as five-time Pac-12 Coach of the Year, leading his team to 10 finishes in the national top 20 and four Pac-12 titles. But this season will be his last as a Trojan after he announced his retirement earlier this month.
It’s a bittersweet goodbye for Gallien, who carved his own legacy into the women’s tennis program. But as he comes to the end of his road with his team, Gallien feels that he finishes his time with his team with no regrets.
“I tried to give my all to the team, to the school and to my players,” Gallien said. “It’s meant so much to me to work in this type of environment, with these types of people, for so long.”
For all his life, he loved USC.
Gallien grew up as a fan. His role model and childhood hero was former USC Athletic Director and quarterback Pat Haden, and Gallien watched his idol play in every game on Saturday. When his family came to Los Angeles for games, Gallien always brought apples to the Coliseum to feed Traveler, the school mascot.
His path, however, didn’t take him to USC at first. Gallien attended Pepperdine University on a tennis scholarship, then stayed to become a coach. He was close to taking a job as the head men’s tennis coach when Haden called to give him an offer to coach the women’s tennis team.
If he wanted a job at USC, he had it. Gallien took the position and never looked back.
Before coming to USC, he’d never coached women before. Gallien wasn’t entirely sure what to expect, but he quickly found that while it was different from his past job, it was exactly what he wanted.
At a school such as USC, sports like women’s tennis often fly under the radar, overshadowed by football and basketball. Yet Gallien found that his athletes still bought into the mentality of being a Trojan, attacking each day with an edge for competition.
“The kids on the football team, they play in front of 100,000 people,” Gallien said. “The kids on the tennis team, they don’t have that environment pushing them on. But they’re still so remarkable, and they’re so incredibly lucky.”
Gallien’s presence made an impact on the program from his very first season. He stepped into the position at a time when the Trojans were struggling to find their place in the then-Pac-10, and quickly rose to notch a 367-144 record with the team.
His team reached this level through a mentality of flexibility. Gallien recognized that each player who joined his team would be different, bringing their own method of attack to the game. If he tried to force every player into a specific style of play, he knew that he would risk limiting their talent.
Instead, Gallien focused on developing each player individually, allowing them to play to their strengths in order to win. In a sport like tennis, he said, it is vital to let each player develop their own approach.
“[Tennis] is boxing without gloves,” Gallien said. “There’s no timeouts. There’s no substitutions. The clock cannot save you. I have a lot of admiration for the girls. They risk so much physically and emotionally.”
It wasn’t always about winning. Not for Gallien, and not for his team.
Whether he was approaching a practice or a championship game, Gallien felt that the most important thing was to make sure that his athletes felt fulfilled both on and off the court.
He believed in the little things, like taking his team on a trip to South Bend for the Notre Dame football game every other year, playing a friendly match against the Irish the night before and then attending the game the next day. These are, he believes, what truly makes a team — camaraderie and trust, not statistics.
As a coach, his highlight reel consists of little moments as well as championship games. Gallien is quick to remember the morning of the Final Four in 2015, when former player Gabriella DeSimone invited him to attend a Mormon service with her at her home church in Texas. The team lost later in the day, but the memory of a quiet morning spent with one of his players remains as one of the best memories of his career.
No matter what, Gallien emphasized that his focus as a coach was in providing each of his players with the best possible college experience.
“Coaching is an enormous privilege,” Gallien said. “I always wanted them to feel like I’m looking out for them. The collegiate experience … it’s special, and I always wanted them to get the very most out of it.”
In the end, Gallien says, tennis has defined his life.
He grew up in a low-income neighborhood in the San Fernando Valley, taking public transit to tennis lessons several days each week. Tennis gave him a scholarship to college and a job for when he graduated; it’s how he met his wife, Lisa, and built his family. And for the last 22 years, USC tennis has been his constant.
Gallien isn’t sure where his future will lead — the tennis court or elsewhere — but he knows that he will always remain anchored to tennis and USC.
“It’s given me everything,” Gallien said. “It really has given me everything, and I couldn’t be any luckier.”
One question which is obvious is why is he leaving or more appropriate was he forced out? Great that he is a Trojan at
heart, but no ncaa championship in 22 years disheartening or even making the title game when in the final four. Only so
many opportunities when you have the talent to take advantage of same to reach the pinnacle of success. Good luck to
him in the future.

How do you sum up four years in 1,000 words? With a collection of loosely related memories? An overarching thesis that tries to tie them all together?
For almost every one of the 120 or so weeks that the Class of 2017 has been at USC, I’ve had the pleasure and challenge of trying to break down the state of Trojan athletics in the space of this column. How can I cram all of those moments — every game, every play, every questionable call, let alone every football head coaching hire — into one column? (Granted, this one’s a little over 1,000 words).
It’s natural for any USC graduate to look at the history of Trojan athletics within the context of a student’s four years at the University. Of course, these four-year blocks overlap with others, and it’s hard to frame any one period separately from all the tradition and history that led up to that point. It’s not like breaking down presidential terms or cycles of Olympic Games. But nonetheless, I have one last argument to make in these columns, as I try to wrap my head around all the nostalgia and memories from my time here at USC.
The Class of 2017 witnessed the craziest four-year turnaround of Trojan football in its history.
This is certainly not to say that we witnessed the best four-year period in USC football history, even the greatest four-year turnaround or the craziest single four-year period. But we have seen a remarkable change in the direction of the football program from our freshman years, and it will be generations until the Trojans ever wind down a road wilder than the one we watched to get to this point.
Granted, my memory of USC football doesn’t include anything prior to 2000, so I qualify that any of my grand superlatives may sell short the accomplishments of the program under Howard Jones, John McKay or John Robinson. But you would have to go all the way back to the 2000 season to have anything which to really compare USC’s current turnaround.
That was Paul Hackett’s last year at the helm in the Coliseum. The team went 5-7. You almost have to stop and double-take at that record to really process it: USC football, at one point in the 21st century, finished a season below .500. Petros Papadakis, then a captain of the team before starting his career as a broadcaster, proudly refers to the group as “the worst football team in USC history.”
Then comes along a guy named Pete Carroll, quarterback Carson Palmer turns into a Heisman trophy winner and by the 2003 season, the Trojans have won an Orange Bowl then a Rose Bowl, the latter earning them an AP Poll National Championship.
So the 2000-2003 four-year block probably deserves the distinction as the greatest actual turnaround. In that span, the football program literally went from “worst” to first. Much ink has been spilt on this paper surrounding the legend of Pete Carroll during that window — the only thing that can really do it any justice at this point is ESPN’s 30 for 30 documentary about the program. Whether the greatest four-year period of USC football should include the 2005 season or end after the 2004 national championship, well, I’ll leave that up to you — but hey, one could even make a case for the string of four consecutive Rose Bowl appearances ending with three wins in a row from the 2005-2008 season.
When solely looking at the wildest, craziest, most bizarre and unbelievable four years at USC, these past four make a great case. But the real wildness within the USC program started just before we got here.
You could include the sanction seasons. You could include Carroll’s departure after the 2009 season and Lane Kiffin’s unremarkable first year in 2010. Almost everyone forgets how amazing Kiffin’s 2011 season was with the Trojans, when the postseason ineligible team went 10-2 — vaulting Matt Barkley into the top of the Heisman watch list and the Trojans to the No. 1 spot in the 2012 preseason AP Poll.
But that’s when I would consider the beginning of the single craziest four years ever of USC football. This was my senior year of high school, just as I was deciding if I would follow through on the lifelong dream of attending USC.
And the Trojans went 7-6. There was the first loss to UCLA in six seasons, what could have been Barkley’s legendary fourth season ending with an injury, coming just short of knocking Notre Dame out of the national championship game — the first time I thought I was going to storm the field at the Coliseum — and then the still unfathomable loss to Georgia Tech’s triple option attack on the windiest day ever in El Paso, Texas in the Sun Bowl — the one where the Trojans forgot to show up on time for the bowl game’s honorary dinner.
Then you can throw in every ridiculous turn that happened between 2013 and 2015 — the ones we on the Daily Trojan spent every week talking about. Kiffin’s us-versus-the-world mentality worked in the last sanction season of 2011, but then crashed on the LAX tarmac after the ASU blowout. Coach O cemented his place in the Interim Football Coaches Hall of Fame, putting the “southern” back in Southern California. But as much as I loved interviewing him — and I must say that my impression of his Bayou drawl was spot-on by the end of that 2013 season — he seems to have finally found his proper home back at LSU. Sarkisian was the final nail in the coffin of the Ghosts of Carroll, proving it was finally time to move on from that phase of USC history.
So concluded the strangest ever four-year stretch in USC football history. The Class of 2016 that got to witness it all will hold that distinction for a long time.
For us seniors, though, we got to watch the story unfold for one more year.
I don’t think anyone from the Daily Trojan was really sold on Clay Helton. It’s impossible to separate his legacy at USC from the performance of Sam Darnold — and I’d like to peddle one last 20/20 hindsight theory that if Helton had waited until after last year’s Utah game to replace Max Browne with Darnold, the Trojans might have played for the national championship this year. But the 2017 season proved that the Trojans have found a leader they can trust in Helton — one who can hopefully bring that elusive consistency that this program has always needed along with its ethos of Southern California swagger.
To put into perspective how remarkable of a turnaround we got to see, we need to look only at the two games that book-ended our four years.
My first USC home game — the first one I ever really tailgated, the first one I witnessed from the student section surrounded by the guys who would turn out to be my best friends, the moment I had spent all of high school looking forward to — was a 10-7 loss to Washington State. Not the respectable Washington State of the new and competitive Pac-12, but the Washington State I had grown up watching USC automatically beat. The Washington State that finished 2013 under .500 held a USC offense to single digits.
My last ever USC football game ever was Rose Bowl win. I had seen four growing up. This one was easily the sweetest.
And there you have it. The craziest four-year turnaround in USC football history.
A lot has changed personally over the course of those four years. I came into USC dreaming of a career covering sports. Now, I think any “job” I’ll have in the sports world will involve coaching them. I would challenge any aspiring sportswriter to never conflate the two. We write to inform fellow fans, not to challenge the coaches we cover. Coaches don’t read sports columns — or at least they shouldn’t — but every fan who loves their team does. If you really think you could have put together a better game plan, give it a try. There is an endless number of opportunities to get involved with youth sports coaching around the country.
To all of my sports editors, it’s been a pleasure. To Jake, the ever reliable ying to my yang in this space these past eight semesters, we’ll have to find something else to disagree about after we graduate. To TrojanCBB and BenFactor, my first-ever comment trolls on the Conquest Chronicles blog, you’re right — I’ll never be a real sportswriter — but to Chris Dufresne, thank you for making sure that I got published in the Los Angeles Times sports page at least once. To Mom and Dad, for the endless support at every different twist my career track, much love.
There will always be a hole in my heart until the Trojan dynasty brings back the national championship it let slip away to Texas. The 2017 season honestly may be the best chance in the foreseeable future for USC to do so, but I have no bold prediction to offer on next year.
If USC can turn that dream into a reality, it will be someone else’s story to tell.

You did not mention one other sports program other than football. State of Trojan athletics was your opening salutation in
2nd paragraph. You must have been asleep during the games and matches that didn’t involve football. A title win against
Texas would have been stripped away by the ncaa in any case.
No one gives a Rats @ss about what the NcAa says or thinks !
Many of those craps should be in Prison for strong arming the USC Trojans, just another Corporation above the law !!
When “2” teams take the field the best team Wins, regardless if one of the players on a team pulls up in a Ferrari !!!
What happens on the field ends on the field…
