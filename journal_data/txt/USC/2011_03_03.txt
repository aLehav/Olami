It was a tale of two halves for junior forward Briana Gilbreath.
In the first half of the USC women’s basketball team’s 74-67 victory over Washington State. Gilbreath scored only three points. But in the second half, Gilbreath scored 16 of her 19 points and collected a clutch rebound as time ran out to preserve her team’s victory.

“[Gilbreath] really took the game over, especially in the second half when we were looking around for some leadership,” said freshman forward Cassie Harberts. “[Gilbreath] always comes through for us.”
Both teams played aggressively throughout the game, as the conference foes both committed 17 turnovers and combined for 49 fouls. The Women of Troy (17-11, 9-8) shot 46 free-throws to match their 46 field-goal attempts.
“In the past we haven’t been a very aggressive team, and that usually works against us,” said USC coach Michael Cooper. “Tonight we were looking to attack the basket more, and put the onus on the officials to make calls.”
The Women of Troy held a 43-42 lead with 16:10 left in the game, but the Cougars (11-15, 6-11), proceeded to go on a 16-8 run. The streak was punctuated by a three-pointer from junior guard Jazmine Perkins, who shot the ball just as the shot clock ran out.
The basket seemed to energize Washington State and deflate USC, as Perkins pumped her fist while the Women of Troy stood in disbelief, in apparent awe of the circus shot Perkins had just pulled off.
But as the game went on, the opposite proved true. Behind 58-51, the Women of Troy got back into the game thanks to some clutch free-throw shooting from Gilbreath and Harberts.
Following Perkins’ three-pointer, USC was fouled on its next six offensive possessions. Each time, Gilbreath or Harberts was sent to the charity stripe. The two combined to make nine out of their 12 foul shots, which tied the game back up at 60.
After senior Kari LaPlante made a jumper in the paint on USC’s next possession, putting her team up 62-61, the crowd went wild.
But USC’s victory wasn’t assured yet, as its free-throw shooting wasn’t quite as clutch down the stretch.
With 17 seconds left, sophomore forward Christina Marinacci went to the free-throw line, attempting to extend USC’s 3-point lead. But neither of the free throws fell through, and it looked as though Washington State would have a chance to tie the game up.
But Gilbreath wound up with the loose ball rebound, and passed to junior guard Ashley Corral, who was fouled.
Corral converted both of her free throws to clinch the 74-67 victory.
Perkins led all scorers with 20 points, while Harberts chipped in 17 buckets to complement Gilbreath’s 19.

The foundation for USC’s men’s volleyball program was built long before Missouri native and senior outside hitter Murphy Troy began pelting the Galen Center hardwood court with explosive kills, and long before a prolific Hawaiian recruiting pipeline produced the McKibbin brothers, Tri Bourne and Henry Cassiday.
Pedigree · While past players will be honored prior to tonight’s game, senior outside hitter Murphy Troy has an impressive résumé of his own. - Daily Trojan file photo 
Two Trojan legends, Dusty Dvorak and Celso Wallace, who played on the 1977 national championship team, will see their jerseys raised to the rafters after tonight’s match against No. 2 BYU, in the presence of Ernie Hix, who coached the team from 1974 to 1981 and is regarded as the godfather of USC’s men’s volleyball program.
At risk of exaggerating comparisons, it is not unimaginable to think that some players on this year’s roster might one day join these icons. An opportunity to improve their résumés presents itself tonight, as the No. 1 USC men’s volleyball team (10-1, 10-1) puts its ranking on the line against No. 2 BYU (13-4, 9-3) at 7 p.m. in the Galen Center.
“[BYU is] a physical team that runs a strong offense, with great attacking in the middle,” said  Murphy Troy, who has accrued eye-popping statistics in his four years at USC. “It’s going to be a great weekend, and we’re really looking forward to the challenge of playing these guys.”
The Trojans’ two most recent road wins were noteworthy for different reasons, as the games posed unique tests of mental fortitude. A game at unranked Cal State Northridge team drew few fans, and questions abounded regarding whether the Trojans would take their lowly opponent too lightly; they won in straight sets.
Against No. 6 Long Beach State, the Trojans had to grind out a grueling five-set win — a stage of the match they have successfully avoided for much of the season. Undoubtedly, tonight’s game might require a fifth set, and the importance of the Trojans’ experience against Long Beach State cannot be discounted.
To defeat BYU, the formula to success has not changed, as the team sees no need to adjust its game plan.
“It sounds cliché, and I’ve said this most weeks, but we must pass the ball well,” said USC coach Bill Ferguson. “We must do a good job blocking when the team is out of its system in order to win the points we should.”
Although opposite Robb Stowell paces the BYU offense with 226 kills at an efficient .345 clip, Ferguson identified the team’s middle blocker Futi Tavana, who has supplemented his 121 kills with an impressive 107 blocks this season, as a player of particular focus for the Trojans.
“Tavana is leading the nation in blocking,” Ferguson said. “He is a big, athletic and skilled player who plays a really physical net game. He really sets the tone up front.”
Senior middle blocker Austin Zahn, however, refused to mask the importance of tonight’s match to his team.
“For us, this is like a mini national championship game right now,” Zahn said. “We’ve beaten [several top-ranked teams], but haven’t gotten a shot at BYU yet.”
[…] No. 1 USC volleyball set to clash with No. 2 BYU Sean McCormick | The Daily Trojan This preview story looks at how it’s fitting that former Trojan All-Americans Dusty Dvorak and Celso Wallace were having their jerseys retired on the same night the top two teams in the nation played each other. In addition, it highlights how the No. 1 Trojans were preparing for their match against No. 2 BYU. […]

By now, you probably have heard about the sex scandal at Brigham Young University. Basically, forward Brandon Davies was suspended from the basketball team for the rest of the year for having consensual sex with his girlfriend.
Now, although this is accepted pretty much anywhere else, BYU has a strict honor code that prohibits this kind of conduct, as well as other things like coffee and tea drinking and watching Charlie Sheen interviews.
Any other year, this would just be a chance for people to have a good laugh and move on. But not this year. What makes this such a big deal is that BYU is in the midst of a special season. Earlier this week there was talk of the Cougars gaining a No. 1 seed in the NCAA tournament after a huge win at No. 6 San Diego State.
Forget about the No. 1 seed now. BYU’s title hopes are pretty much dashed. Davies was the Cougars leading rebounder and third leading scorer. After I heard this news, my initial reaction was, “how could anyone survive at BYU?” It’s gotta be the only place in the country where Starbucks is less popular than Star Jones.
My second reaction was, “If USC had an honor code, so that all students would have to adhere to uniform Trojan standards, what would it be?” USC has a code of ethics and a student conduct code, but no university-wide honor code.
With Davies possibly getting expelled from BYU, I’m officially opening up my bid to make him a Trojan. He would have to follow the new honor code, however.
Here are my suggestions for the first-ever USC honor code to be followed by students and athletes alike (including you, Davies). Any violation of these guidelines will result in the forfeiture of Kevin O’Neill bobblehead the received at the basketball game last week. If you don’t have one (you are missing out), then you will have to stand in Lane Kiffin’s office until you can make him laugh. If he’s on a recruiting visit, you must eat a meal at EVK.
1) Thou shalt never accept losing to UCLA.
2) Thou shalt not accept golf cart rides from strangers.
3) Thou shalt not ride your bike or skateboard within a 50-mile radius of campus. It’s getting too crowded.
4) Thou shalt watch at least one Champions League soccer game in Café 84 on a Tuesday or Wednesday afternoon. The atmosphere is electric.
5) Thou shalt not sit in Trojan Nation at kickoff, especially without “tailgaiting” beforehand.
6) Thou shalt not fornicate … during a USC football game.
7) Thou shalt not attempt to hide Malibu in a sunscreen bottle before a night game at the Coliseum.
8) Thou shalt learn to pronounce the name of women’s soccer coach Ali Khosroshahin. I’m not going to help you. That’s cheating.
9) Thou shalt not speak poorly of the Song Girls. Ever.
So there you have it. I know nine rules are a lot to follow, but just think of the consequences. If somehow you do break one, you better have some good jokes lined up.
“Spittin’ Sports” runs Fridays. To comment on this article e-mail Kenny at klegan@usc.edu or visit dailytrojan.com.
I am curious, violation of code apart, did he volunteer the information? How in the world did they know and how did they prove it? 
Generally I’d assume codes/rules of ethics cannot survive if they are applied to ones personal life.
3) Thou shalt not ride your bike or skateboard within a 50-mile radius of campus. It’s getting too crowded.
Or at least ride on the street and/or in the bike lanes and not on the sidewalk – while on your phone.
My undergrad institution has this same issue and they painted bike and pedestrian designated paths. That may help. Also, if DPS enforced the “walk your bike” rule rather than just yelling at students as they ride by…  That may also help.
Thou shalt not espouse personal values of hate-mongering bigotry while serving in a public role representing USC – Oh darn but then we’d lose that guy on the football team.

USC baseball interim head coach Frank Cruz knows his team can play with ranked teams, but he’s anxious to see how his team plays against a top-10 opponent.
Taking the hill · USC ace Andrew Triggs will get the start on Friday. Triggs has struggled so far this season with a 6.75 ERA through two starts. - Daily Trojan file photo 
Cruz will find out this weekend when the Trojans (3-5) take on No. 7 Cal State Fullerton (6-3) in a split home-and-away weekend series that will begin tonight at 7 p.m. at Goodwin Field in Fullerton, Calif.
The two teams will again face off at Goodwin Field Saturday at 6 p.m. before playing the series finale Sunday at Dedeaux Field at 1 p.m.
USC has lost four consecutive games, each time giving up the lead in the final three innings. But Cruz seemed confident it won’t take much for the Trojans to get over the hump when asked about what needs to change.
“Timely hitting and not giving up the walk or hit by pitch in the seventh, eighth and ninth innings,” Cruz said. “It’s just baseball.”
The Trojans have left an average of 9.5 men on base per game, including 14 in the seventh, eighth and ninth innings during their current four-game losing streak.
Instead of worrying about the opportunities it has let slip away, USC is looking to take advantage of its time on the national stage.
“We’re not looking back on what hasn’t happened. We’re looking forward on what can happen,” Cruz said. “If we play well and get a few Ws this weekend, no one will remember what happened last week, so we’re really excited about that.”
Wins won’t be easy to come by this weekend with the Trojans playing the Titans, one of the top college baseball programs in the country. Fullerton has made six College World Series appearances in the last 10 years and has not missed the NCAA tournament since 1991
Fullerton coach Dave Serrano, who has won at least 41 games in each of his three seasons as coach of the Titans, has a strong pitching staff this season led by Noe Ramirez.
Ramirez was a second team All-American last season after finishing with a 12-1 record and a 2.54 ERA in 16 starts. This season, he has a 2.08 ERA with 13 strikeouts in 13 innings.
Ramirez will likely face off with Trojans’ ace Andrew Triggs on Friday night. Triggs (0-0, 6.75 ERA) has yet to find his groove in his first two starts this season.
“He’s fine to go Friday night,” Cruz said. “He’s a veteran and that’s why we have him there.”
Cruz said he is more concerned with how the junior will handle the Titans’ heavily left-handed lineup.
“He and [senior Logan] Odom have been working hard on pitches to get left-handers out.  It’s going to be a really good test for them,” Cruz said. “Fullerton has a lot of left-handers. UCLA and Arizona State in the future will have a lot of left-handers. This is a good way to get ready for conference.”
Odom, who is coming off a strong start against No. 22 Rice, will start Sunday, most likely against Colin O’Connell (1-0, 1.29 ERA).
Junior Austin Wood (1-0, 3.86 ERA) will get the ball Saturday against Tyler Pill, who received a no decision in Fullerton’s first of two wins at No. 4 Rice last weekend.
The Trojans do have an advantage on the offensive side, as their team batting average is 32 points higher than the Titans’ average. USC has four batters hitting above .365, led by senior Joe De Pinto’s .500 average and team-leading nine RBIs.
The Titans’ Richy Pedroza was named the Big West Player of the Week earlier this week and is currently batting .406, but Fullerton’s best hitter is first baseman/closer Nick Ramirez.
Like USC junior first baseman Ricky Oropesa (.281, 0 HR, 5 RBI), Ramirez has yet to find his power stroke with the new BBCOR bats this season.
After hitting .346 with 16 homers and 75 RBI last season, Ramirez hasn’t hit a home run this season. He leads the team with six RBIs, however.
The Trojans will have to contain Ramirez and get some timely hits to knock off one of the premier baseball programs in the country.
“I continue to tell these guys, it’s about continuing to persevere and continuing to battle and knowing that something good is at the end of the line,” Cruz said. “We’re looking forward to that.”

Coming off a four-game winning streak, the Trojans had third place in the Pac-10 in their sight, and were looking to win their final two games of the regular season to improve their résumé for the NCAA Selection Committee.
Defensive force · Despite scoring just six points Thursday night, senior forward Marcus Simmons held Washington State junior guard Klay Thompson, considered the Pac-10’s best scoring threat, to just 35 percent shooting from the field. - Tim Tran | Daily Trojan
Instead, after losing on Thursday at Washington State, 85-77, the USC men’s basketball team (17-13, 9-8) now needs to win Saturday to avoid finishing sixth in the Pac-10.
The Cougars (19-10, 9-8) jumped out in front early, starting the game on a 10-2 run. By halftime, The Trojans trailed 41-26.
USC came out of the locker room on fire, opening the second half on an 11-3 run. Senior guard Donte Smith made four three-pointers after halftime, sparking the Trojans’ rally.
“We started the second half hot,” Smith said. “We played with a lot of energy. If we would have come out like that in the first half, we would have won.”
Washington State bounced back and extended its lead to 16 points.
Undeterred, the Trojans cut the Cougars’ lead to one point with just eight minutes left in the game.
USC did not have enough depth to complete the comeback. Smith, senior guard Marcus Simmons and senior forward Alex Stepheson fouled out, forcing USC coach Kevin O’Neill to use walk-on James Dunleavy late in the game.
Eighty-five points is the most scored by an opponent against USC this season. For the game, the Cougars shot .547 and made .400 of their three-point attempts.
Junior forward Nikola Vucevic led the Trojans with 22 points and 11 rebounds. Freshman guard Maurice Jones had 16 points, and was 4-of-6 from beyond the arc. Junior forward Jio Fontan had eight points and a game-high seven assists.
Surprisingly, Washington State had the advantage in the post. Despite having two of the top three rebounders in the Pac-10, USC was outrebounded by eight in the opening half and six in the game. The Cougars outscored the Trojans in the paint by 14 points in the first half.
Simmons, USC’s defensive stopper, picked up two quick fouls in the first half and ultimately fouled out of the game. Washington State guard Klay Thompson, the leading scorer in the Pac-10, took advantage, scoring 10 points in the opening half and 22 points overall.
Junior forward DeAngelo Casto led Washington State with 24 points and 10 rebounds. Junior guard Faisal Aden had 20 points.
The Trojans conclude the regular season Saturday at Washington at 7:30 p.m.
“Saturday is now a must-win,” Smith said.
USC lost to the Huskies (20-9, 11-6) on Dec. 29 in overtime, 73-67, despite 28 points and 14 rebounds from Vucevic.
Washington won seven of its first eight Pac-10 games. Since then, the Huskies are 4-5 in conference competition.
Washington is led by junior guard Isaiah Thomas, who averages 16.9 points and 5.8 assists per game. With Simmons guarding him for much of the first match-up, however, Thomas only managed to score 10 points and had a game-high six turnovers.
Senior forward Matthew Bryan-Amaning contributes 16.5 points and 8.3 rebounds per game for the Huskies.
Washington is a high-scoring team and leads the Pac-10 with an average of 85.4 points per game.
“We are not going to score 90, 100 or even 80 points like they do,” Fontan said. “We need to slow the game down.”

Following its recent success at the Claremont Relays this past weekend, the USC track and field team is competing in the Ben Brown Invitational in Fullerton, Calif. this weekend with the intention of continuing to improve.
According to director Ron Allice, the team is still in the evaluation and training stage of the season.
Allice also spoke about how the team is constantly looking to improve towards a peak at the important meets of the season. In the early parts of the season, athletes use the meets as a chance to qualify for later, more important meets where winning is more important.
“This meet is part of the evaluation process on behalf of the coaching staff to see the results of our preparation,” Allice said. “It’s a way for the athletes to hopefully progress and see all of our hard work, that started in September, start to pay off.“
The track and field season is different from most athletic seasons in that the coaches must bring the athletes to a physical peak at the end of the season, where results really count.
“With track and field, nobody can help you but yourself,” Allice said. “You prepare your body to perform, and if you rush it or try to take shortcuts, ultimately your potential is stagnated or interrupted. We try to bring people around where it really counts.”
USC will be sending all of its athletes besides the male sprinters, although many will be competing in events that are not their specialization in order to train and prepare.
So far, the team has looked prepared. At the Claremont Relays last weekend, USC looked strong, with thirteen individual top five finishes as well as several relay wins, despite battling sub-40 degree weather and hail.
Freshman Laura Blackburn was the winner in the 100-meter high hurdles, finishing .75 seconds ahead of second place with a time of 13.81 seconds. Sophomore Thea Weiss won the women’s pole vault with a jump of 10-6.00ft, and Taylor Slingsby won the men’s with a jumb of 15-5.50ft. Sophomore Tyler Ruiz and freshman Viktor Fajoyomi won the high jump with jumps of 6-8.00 and 6-6.00 respectively.
“Everybody from the sprinters all the way up through the middle distance group looked pretty good for where we are at this point in time,” Allice said. “The staff was generally pleased with what we saw. With weather like that, you just want to make sure you get out of there healthy.”
The Ben Brown Invitational will take place Saturday and Sunday in Fullerton, Calif.

Aigerim Duiseneyeva graduated from the USC Marshall School of Business in 2007 with a Bachelor of Science in finance and international relations. After graduation she moved to New York, where she worked as an analyst for UBS’ Global Consumer Products & Retail Investment Banking Group for two years.
Worldly · Aigerim Duiseneyeva graduated from the Marshall School of Business in 2007 and is won second place in the New Venture Seed Competition. -  Courtesy of Aigerim Duiseneyva 
She returned to USC to compete against Master’s business students in the New Venture Seed Competition, in which she and her partners presented their business idea, Triptrotting, and won second place.
Daily Trojan: What is Triptrotting and how does it work?
Aigerim Duiseneyeva: Triptrotting is an online platform that connects travelers with like-minded locals around the world. Imagine yourself going to Dubai and actually knowing someone local before you arrive.
Someone who’s your age, is in the same profession, has similar interests and aspirations and also comes from one of the top universities. That’s what we do.
We connect students and young professionals when they travel with students and young professionals in their travel destination. And we connect them using a personality matching algorithm.
It looks at your interests and your personality and what you want to do, and it matches you with someone in that location who is similar to you.
DT: How did you come up with Triptrotting?
Duiseneyeva: The idea came from our own experiences, actually, myself and my business partner. We both went to USC’s Marshall School of Business, and while at Marshall we traveled extensively. I have personally been to over 10 different travel destinations: Tokyo, Taipei, Hong Kong, Beijing.
We went to Mexico, we went to Shanghai, Bangkok, Singapore … So in all of those trips we noticed that everywhere we went we met American students, but we never saw any of the local students … We wanted a way to go beyond just taking pictures of the Eiffel Tower, to actually meeting peers.
DT: How did you develop your idea?
Duiseneyeva: We founded Triptrotting in the end of 2009, and in April 2010 there was a Seed competition at Marshall. We competed against other people at the Master’s level, so against people with MBAs, and we were one of the winners … But really it was the connections we made through that competition that mattered.
Through that competition we were introduced to someone from Idealab, Brad Hines, who was one of the coaches there. A few months later when we got back in touch, they were interested in potentially investing.
DT: How do you want Triptrotting to influence students?
Duiseneyeva: Our mission is to expand cultural understanding. At the end of the day we are all the same; regardless of your background, regardless of what country you’re from, we’re all people. And what we want students to realize from the TripTrotting experience is that when you meet a person from another culture, someone you’ve never spoken to, and you become friends, that creates a special relationship across the world.
DT: What trips have you taken that have influenced your life?
Duiseneyeva: When I went to Dubai I met some locals, which is hard to do because 80% of residents in Dubai are expats from the Western World.  We met some locals, who were 25 and went to the university … It changes your perception of the local country from the local’s perspective.
What I learned is that the locals are not doing well; I saw first-hand the effects of Westernization in that country.
DT: What was the most influential trip you took while you went to USC?
Duiseneyeva: The most influential one was the first trip I took to Tokyo, which was in March of 2006. It was my first trip to Asia, and that really opened my eyes to differences in Asian culture and tradition … We had meetings with companies organized by Marshall School of Business.
So not only did I get to experience the culture, but I got to explore the business side of the city and the government … You’re not just going there and taking a picture; you’re taking real, educational experiences back with you.
DT: What is your present relationship with USC?
Duiseneyeva: We are working with Marshall School of Business, with all of their exchange programs, all of their short- and long-term trips. As an alum I am very connected. I like to work on career panels, talk to students about their experiences.
DT: What clubs or activities were you involved in at USC?
Duiseneyeva: When I went to USC I was part of the Marshall International Case Competition, which was the most amazing thing I could have done … They choose four students to compete in these competitions all around the world, in Hong Kong, Ohio State, McGill and at home. So in teams of four they present you with a case and you have to crack the case, come up with a solution and make a presentation.
DT: What was the most valuable part of your experiences with USC?
Duiseneyeva: One thing that I took away from USC that I really appreciate is the skill sets and abilities involved in networking. I acquired a lot of confidence from meeting people from other places, and I think those experiences are really what separates USC from other schools.
DT: What advice would you give to current students?
Duiseneyeva: Take advantage of the USC network. It doesn’t matter what career you’re choosing or where you want to go in your life, the USC network is the most amazing thing I have ever had access to. My second piece of advice is to follow your passion. There are a lot of myths about what you’re supposed to do after you graduate. I know a lot of people who I went to school with now who aren’t happy because they’re not doing something they like. It is really important to follow your passion, and when you do so, you are going to be very successful in your career.

The Princeton Review and GamePro magazine  recently named USC as the best game design program among schools in North America for the second consecutive year.

The rankings consider the success of both the Interactive Media Division, a part of the USC School of Cinematic Arts, as well as the computer science major with a concentration in game development available through the Viterbi School of Engineering. USC took the top spot for both undergraduate and graduate divisions.
“Obviously we’re really excited and honored that The Princeton Review would rank us as the top program again,” said Tracy Fullerton, chair of the interactive media division at the USC School of Cinematic Arts. “Our mix of practice and theory, as well as our focus on making and understanding games really helps us understand the culture of game design.”
Criteria for the rankings ranged from items such as the quality of faculty members to the post-graduate plans of students in the program, something Fullerton said she believes could have put USC above the rest.
“This program has a sort of notoriety for producing an amazing group of alumni that are currently in the industry,” Fullerton said. “We have a really fantastic mix of people in terms of our faculty and students that give our program a really neat culture.”
Many students cite versatility and breadth of the curriculum as reasons why they believe USC received the No. 1 ranking.
“The range is huge, from character development to sound design to programming, and what’s great is that you can structure your course load to what you are actually interested in,” said Brittney Black, a sophomore majoring in interactive entertainment. “You get a good combination of theory and practice with lots of hands-on learning.”
Yannis Yortsos, dean of the Viterbi School of Engineering, said he has seen a tremendous increase in interest in the program after being ranked for the second year in a row.
“Our program has become very popular, even though it only started five years ago,” Yortsos said. “Lots of kids are interested in coming here and are attracted to how we overlap computer science and entertainment. It’s a powerful combination and something I believe we do really well here.”

After a resounding defeat at the hands of archrival UCLA, the USC women’s tennis team looks to start another winning streak in its Pac-10 opener at home against Washington.
Despite their recent hiccup, the Women of Troy (7-2) have been a dominant force all season long, led by one of the nation’s best players in senior Maria Sanchez.
Facing Washington (8-4), Sanchez will have her hands full in her singles match, squaring off against No. 6 Denise Dy. 
Though Sanchez has notched victories against four top-10 players this season, how she comes out of the gate after a taxing match against McCall Jones on Wednesday will be critical. 
Sanchez won’t be the only one with a challenge on her hands, with sophomore Danielle Lao matched up against No. 27 Venise Chan. Lao suffered a rare defeat against the Bruins, going down quietly in what could have been her worst match of the season.
“If [Lao and Pamela Montez] played ten times it’s going to maybe be 5-5 or 6-4,” USC coach Richard Gallien said. “Sometimes it’s one of those things that you aren’t as good as you think you are nor as bad as you think.”
Freshman Kaitlyn Christian had a rough outing of her own against UCLA’s top player, No. 64 Andrea Remnyse.
Although her eight-match winning streak was snapped against UCLA’s Montez, sophomore Valeria Pulido had been playing very strong.
A win for junior Alison Ramos would also be a huge boost not just for the team, but also for her confidence moving forward. 
“We may be a thin team, but we are a tight squad in terms of chemistry,” Gallien said.
Although Washington isn’t nearly as talented as USC, the duo of Chan and Dy, both pose the biggest challenge to coach Gallien’s group.  
“I think we’re going to come out really well [against Wash.],” Gallien said. “Our girls will fight on Friday and I expect no one to hang their head with a tough game ahead.”
First serve is at 1:30 p.m. at Marks Stadium.

From brain teasers to major-specific challenges, students will have the opportunity to team up and compete for four free Disneyland tickets at “The Academic Race” today.
The event, hosted by the Academic Culture Assembly, will take place on McCarthy Quad from 5 p.m. to 9 p.m. Chick-fil-A sandwiches will also be provided to all participants.
“We really hope to mix up the student population because at school, you usually meet people in your major and not other majors,” said Frank Chen, director of the Academic Cultural Assembly. “We wanted to create an event that mixes people of different majors to get together and work toward a common goal.”
The event is loosely based on the popular TV show The Amazing Race and will have a similar set of rules.
Students are asked to form teams of four. Teams will start out at the first station with a problem. Upon solving the problem, they will receive a clue to the next station. The team that completes the problem at the last station with the fewest penalties will be the winner. There will be 10 stations total.
“We want this to be a way for [students] to spark interests in other fields,” Chen said. “We want to get students talking about what they’ve learned in their majors and to share it with each other.”
Although students are encouraged to RSVP before the event, it is not required.
“We’re trying to get 150 students to attend,” Chen said. “Right now we have about 10 to 15 teams, but we’re hoping that more people will come.”
Helen Yuan, campus relations director of the Academic Cultural Assembly, said they did not originally plan for many people to attend the event.
“Our limit is 20 teams,” Yuan said. “It’s the first year, so I’m not expecting too much, but hopefully it will be great.”
Although this is the first time the event has been held, Yuan, who came up with the event idea, hopes it will become an annual event.
“I’m really excited to see if everything works out and if people like the event,” Yuan said. “I think it’s great to let people of different majors interact and to emphasize people’s strengths.”

Audi has turned to a USC professor and five students to improve its automobile technology.
The aim of the new three-year research initiative, which is called “Audi Urban Intelligent Assist,” which provides detailed information to drivers so they have a better sense of the driving conditions surrounding them.
“Working on this project is good for the university and we will also be able to further our research,” said Petros Ioannou, professor and director of the Center for Advanced Transportation Technologies, which engages in transportation research.
Ioannou’s team consists of masters student Brandon Foster, studying computer science, and Ph.D students Afshin Abadi studying electrical engineering aerospace & mechanical engineering, Tooraj Rajabioun, studying electrical engineering, Vadim Butakov, studying electrical engineering and Yun Wang, studying electrical engineering systems, who will receive funds for their work while the projects will help them work toward their degrees.
The students were chosen based on their credentials, grades and ability to do research in the area, according to Ioannou.
Ioannou said the USC students will be designing technology that cars cab utilize in large cities. For example, the car will know to take a different route if there is road construction or traffic congestion.
Audi experts selected USC students to work on the project, which began Jan. 1, because the Center for Advanced Transportation Technologies is well known for its research in vehicles, according to Ioannu.
“Each student is responsible for a specific part of the project,” Rajabioun said. “This research is unique and no other universities are doing the same research. Therefore, at the end of this project, USC will be the first university to have this technology.”
The vision is to develop Audi models that will recognize individual motorists behind the wheel, know preferred destinations, routes the motorists have most commonly traveled and the time needed to reach appointments. The car will be able to help the drivers detect and avoid dangerous situations as well.
“The intent is to develop new technologies and make better use of the transportation system,” said Randolph Hall, associate director of the Center for Advanced Transportation Technology. “It connects us to one of the international auto producers and enables us to think forward.”
Mansour Rahimi, associate professor and coordinator of the human factors laboratory, said the research project deals with the intelligence transportation systems.
“This is not a new phenomenon or a new line of research, but safety and risk ultimately is a question of trust in technology,” Rahimi said. “With proper design and proper testing, however, one can minimize the hazards associated with the automated systems.”
Along with USC, the University of California, Berkley, the University of California, San Diego and the University of Michigan are also contributing to the three-year project.
“It is a great learning experience in mathematical modeling, traffic simulations and programming,” Rajabioun said. “The future connected Audi will basically take care of all the little things that make driving in the city tedious and dangers so that motorists can enjoy the drive and get to where they want to go efficiently, safely and comfortably.”

A great story is a terrible thing to waste.
The Adjustment Bureau, the new thriller starring Matt Damon and Emily Blunt, offers an intriguing concept that is poorly realized. The stars manage to rise above their material, but as a whole, the film still fails to deliver.
Very loosely based on a 1954 Philip K. Dick short story entitled Adjustment Team, The Adjustment Bureau stars Damon as David Norris, a Congressional candidate from Brooklyn who meets Elise (Blunt), a ballerina, on election night. The two share an electrifying kiss, meet again by chance on a city bus and sparks fly.
But it turns out Norris was not supposed to be on that bus and was not supposed to see Elise again. His fate is thrown off-course by a mistake, and he sees something no one is supposed to see — the mysterious fedora-clad men of the Adjustment Bureau, who must keep people on their fated tracks.
The men of the Adjustment Bureau order Norris to keep their existence a secret, threatening to erase his memory and adding that he cannot see Elise again.
They reveal that being with Elise would mean ruining both his political career and her chance to be a world-class ballerina.
But as Norris becomes more and more convinced that he only wants to be with Elise, he will do whatever it takes to escape the men who insist she is not part of his destined path.
It’s a promising setup with the potential for suspense and the exhilaration of intriguing science fiction, but director and screenwriter George Nolfi, in his directorial debut, fails to capitalize on any of this.
The film, which superficially addresses questions of fate and free will, is clumsily handled and inconsistent in tone.
The film’s lack of a clear or effective mood turns the Bureau itself into something of a joke. For an organization that ominously and mysteriously controls all lives, it fails to actually be ominous or mysterious, making countless silly mistakes that just aren’t believable.
Moments when Bureau members ought to appear menacing are more comical, and it is entirely unclear whether the humor is intentional.
Anthony Mackie (The Hurt Locker), the empathetic adjuster who reaches out to Norris, is likable enough, but neither he nor Mad Men’s John Slattery, Mackie’s superior on Norris’ case, seem invested in the characters they portray.
The film could have benefited from a darker tone and more potent energy (think Minority Report, another Dick adaptation dealing with similar themes), but Nolfi keeps everything lighthearted, never delving beneath the surface.
In addition, the weirdly religious overtones (the Adjustment Bureau might or might not be made up of angels, and their unseen “chairman” seems to be God) only detract from the potential for purely sci-fi intrigue.
The film makes an odd, undeveloped attempt at being topical with frequent clips from news networks discussing the congressional race and a clip of Norris appearing on The Daily Show.
It briefly captures the incessant chatter of the 24-hour news cycle, but never goes anywhere profound with it.
America’s current mess of a political system provides something of a backdrop for The Adjustment Bureau, but without intelligently integrating it into the story, Nolfi fails to make any cogent point on the matter.
Still, Damon and Blunt have the talent to make The Adjustment Bureau an occasionally enjoyable experience despite its overwhelming flaws.
They both exude their own magnetic charisma, and the pair’s electric chemistry is the only thing that keeps the audience invested.
Blunt is stunning, managing to imbue Elise with a depth that is completely lacking in the script itself.
It seems Damon, by no means at his best in this role, can’t fail to charm an audience, and as the hopeful congressman, he exhibits an uncorrupted moral compass that makes the audience wish it could actually vote for him.
The attractive pair is convincing enough to make us believe their love can overcome all obstacles, but the biggest obstacles in the film are the lackluster screenplay and clumsy direction.
The only surprise in Nolfi’s tryingly predictable film is that Damon and Blunt can craft a believable and even exhilarating romance in a picture that offers nothing else to be exhilarated by.

Our culture seems to be built around barriers.
For the past few decades, these barriers have divided entertainment media. Television was television; film was film. The barriers divided people, too. There were geeks, there were jocks, there were rebels and there wasn’t any crossover.
Things are changing. These barriers are breaking down and different media are crossing over now.
Additionally, niche interests are not just for geeks; now, everyone obsesses over something.
Different areas of the entertainment world are branching out and not only affecting other media, but also offering commentary on the changing world.
In no medium is this more evident than in comics.
“We live in what has essentially become a hyper-evolved, rapidly changing market,” said comic book writer Jonathan Hickman. “It’s not even just the market, it’s the environment. If you’re not writing stuff that feels ahead of the curve, you’re missing out. And the curve is just ripping away from you as a creator.”
Hickman is one of many writers looking at current culture to influence his work, focusing on how technology, urban life and the convergence of trends affect daily life.
Each writer offers his own commentary on today’s changing culture, whether it’s the mad futurism and development in Hickman’s Fantastic Four, the breakdown of cliques and the use of technology in life in Nick Spencer’s Morning Glories and The Infinite Vacation, or the psychological overtones in Scott Snyder’s Detective Comics and American Vampire.
Part of this comes from the crossover between comic books and the rest of the entertainment world, as more and more comic book properties are being licensed to television, cinema and video games.
“This is the kind of weird period of history,” Hickman said. “I don’t know any comic book guys that aren’t meddling in TV and movies.”
It’s not just the media changing the comic world, but people, too. Thanks to the rise of social media, people are sharing more information about themselves with others and finding out they are not alone in their interests.
“What happens in an information society when you do that is that you can suddenly connect easily with people who like similar things,” Spencer said. ”If you were the one kid on the street who liked comics or video games, now everyone who likes that is just a click away.”
This has helped to erode the long-held social archetypes, especially with comics, as geeks are finally shaking off fears of being loners and proudly admitting their interests.
“We don’t feel like outcasts for liking them or enjoying them anymore,” Spencer said. “Now we sort of have community in these things. I don’t know if geek culture even exists anymore, there’s no real sense of isolation with readers, no fear of rejection.”
This is most true in the way the comic book audience is being perceived. The stereotype of readers as The Simpsons’ Comic Book Guy, once quite popular at the end of the last century, is now dead and shows no sign of reemerging in modern culture.
“When I was a kid, comics were barely coed,” Snyder said. “Now you go to Comic-Con and you’ll see people of all backgrounds, genders, races, everything. It feels much more diverse and much less stereotyped than it used to be.”
And as the culture continues to change, writers are continuing to explore that shift. With the barriers that once separated parts of society now broken, it leaves both the present and the future without any framework to evolve in.
“For me I’m telling more and more stories about what’s good, what’s bad, what’s working for people individually about that change and what’s missing,” Spencer said. “What are people’s personal destinies, their calling and their purpose? That’s the stuff I’m interested in.”

Since first coming into the pseudo-main stream world of music, Chaz Bundick, who created the stage name Toro y Moi (Bull and Me), has returned with his second album in two years, Underneath the Pine. Sadly, only a few songs in the album are really worth listening to.
Magic trick · Underneath the Pine recalls Radiohead tracks at times, but also presents tracks that lull the listener to sleep. The album makes it difficult to fully understand the songs the first time through. - Photo courtesy of Force Field PR
As a whole, the album is overwhelmingly bizarre. In Bundick’s previous album, Causers of This, the sounds were energetic but not overpowering, and still allowed the album to be interestingly off-beat. Underneath the Pine, however, fails to generate the same curiosity the first album spurred. This time, the feeling is one of annoyance.
The biggest problem with the album is its poor use of instrumentals. “Intro/Chi Chi” feels straight off of a Thievery Corporation album with only instrumentals. It’s an interesting mix of keys, drums and feedback, but in the beginning of the song, it seems as though the instruments themselves are in pain.
The mood fluctuates from there on. At times the album plunges into a negative vibe and instrumentals that are hard on listeners’ ears. Other times it presents much calmer tunes. The mood of “New Beat,” a combination of ’90s jamming and chill-wave vibes gives the listener a good tune to sway to. The song gets better as it continues, but the boingy-boing, phase-shifting sounds in the background can prompt a headache. The song eventually weaves into a kaleidoscope-type trance that includes people in the background chanting “don’t forget.”
Thankfully, “Go With You” lets the listener relax a little more. It is closer to what one might expect from Toro y Moi and is far less obnoxious than the previous song. Less than half of the song is lyrically based, and the other half is instrumentals with calm, cool sounds alongside sparkling chimes in the background. The song’s parts are nice and make for easy background music for things like doing homework or riding an elevator.
The tone comes down even more with “Divina,” which brings a much darker tone to the album, sometimes echoing “Deep” or “Fame” by Radiohead. When listening to this song, the stirring effect music can have on the soul is audibly evident. There are no lyrics and the sounds are effectively mixed together. Be warned, though, the song is definitely somewhat sleep-inducing. Keeping a pillow nearby is not a bad idea.
Unfortunately, these calming melodies do not make up for some unspectacular and strange songs found in the album.
“How I Know,” in particular, has conflicting sounds that lend the song a faulty composition. Bundick would do well to consider sticking with one rhythm or pattern.
“Good Hold” starts off dark enough to induce frowns and maybe a tear drop or two. The piano is intense, and even though the song eventually evens out, the beginning of the track practically ruins the whole piece, leaving a sour taste in the listener’s mouth.
The album ends well with “Elise,” once again harnessing the familiar rhythms one might expect from Toro y Moi. In the middle of the song, however, what sounds unnervingly like a Boy Scout choir adds a straining layer of vocal chords. With this song, the album partially redeems the album’s midsection failures.
Underneath the Pine can only really be enjoyed if the listener is willing to deconstruct the songs before actually enjoying them. In this case, that process could take three listens of the calmer but perplexing LP.

The Texas state legislature recently introduced a bill that would allow students to carry concealed firearms on college campuses. With broad support in both the Republican-dominated House and the Senate, the bill is likely to become law soon, and Texan students will then be able to bring their hidden guns to class.
Julia Vann | Daily Trojan
Supporters of the Texas measure, especially the advocacy group Students for Concealed Carry on Campus, are quick to point out that the bill does not allow anyone who does not already have a permit to carry a concealed weapon to bring a gun to campus. The bill ensures Texans have “the same right to self-defense on college campuses as they do elsewhere in Texas,” according to the group’s website.
The group and other supporters note that colleges generally lack adequate protection against shootings, that rules against carrying guns onto campus are unlikely to stop anyone with intent to kill from doing so and that the Second Amendment gives everyone the right to protect themselves with firearms.
These are all solid points, but they are underwhelming relative to the weighty proposal being pushed by their proponents.
It is true rules will not deter a crazy person from bringing a gun to campus and shooting, and it is also true there is a small chance someone else, if allowed, could be armed and able to  potentially stop a disaster.
College campuses, however, are places of learning and trust. Guns should simply not be permitted to intrude on the positive environment that so many colleges  seek to create. I certainly would not be happy with the knowledge that a classmate is carrying a gun, even if he is licensed to have it.
In the wake of the Virginia Tech massacre in 2007, and especially in light of the recent shooting of Rep. Gabrielle Giffords in Tucson, Arizona, the movement to liberalize gun regulations has gained new momentum based on the argument that more armed citizens could have prevented these tragedies or ended them sooner.
No matter how popular it is, though, this argument is a logical fallacy. More guns possibly could have prevented the Virginia Tech or Tucson shootings, but they might also would lead to new acts of violence that otherwise would not have happened.
Defenders of gun rights often respond to this line of thought by claiming the stringent requirements for gun permits mean only those interested in self-defense will be able to purchase them legally. Even if guns were outlawed, or at least made more difficult to buy, they argue, criminals would continue to find ways to arm themselves, leaving innocent people defenseless.
This logic does not hold. Both Seung-Hui Cho, the Virginia Tech shooter, and Jared Lee Loughner, the Tucson shooter, purchased their guns legally. The response to these events cannot be to make it even easier to buy and carry guns.
Although the Second Amendment guarantees the right to own a gun, the original Constitution also defined a slave as three-fifths of a person and allowed only white, property-owning males to vote. The Constitution as originally conceived was full of rules that seem archaic today; the whole concept of amendments was designed to allow the law to change with the times.
The Second Amendment was conceived in the context of a colonial revolution that owed much of its success to militia forces. In the revolutionary era, when militaries were not only seen as potential oppressors of their own people, the Constitution aimed to secure citizens’ ability to resist their government with force if it became necessary.
Today, when our military spends hundreds of billions of dollars annually on fighter jets and cruise missiles, this entire rationale is an anachronism. It has been replaced in the public debate by the misguided idea, pushed aggressively by the National Rifle Association, that more liberal gun laws will reduce violence by allowing innocents to defend themselves.
The idea is manifested in the legality of semi-automatic assault weapons in the United States and the ability of people like Loughner to purchase guns from a store. Soon that list will include the legality of concealed weapons on some states’ college campuses, to the detriment of the students, universities and ultimately, the nation.
Daniel Charnoff is a senior majoring in international relations (global business). His column, “Through the Static,” runs Fridays.
I don’t see how you “not being happy” about a classmate having a gun has any relevance to whether or not they should be banned on campus. Fifty years ago, I’m sure we had a lot of students who said they would “not be happy” about a classmate being black. 
Thankfully, we live in a nation of principles, and were able to get rid of those bigoted ideas against minority races that were contrary to the spirit of the Constitution. Maybe someday we will be able to get rid of the bigotry towards responsible gun owners as well.
Maybe we should take a look at the rest of the world, and see that people all over are fighting to free themselves from oppressive governments and oppressive laws. Maybe we should learn that the way forward involves empowering the populace, not emasculating it by only allowing a very small minority of people to be arme. 
In feudal times, the only people who could legally arm themselves were knights, the peasants had no right to do so. In a free society, there is absolutely no room to discriminate between a class of people who have the right to arm and protect themselves, and a class of people who do not.
I don’t go to USC, I go to another college, but I wanted to comment on this.  I have a stalker.  He wants to kill me.  I’d really like it if campus police could keep me safe, but they can’t.  I’d really like it if they could keep the students he might hurt trying to get to me safe if he decides to show up with a gun, but they can’t.  Read the reports of “suspect with a gun” and how quickly things go bad. I can’t afford to hire a bodyguard to go to class with me, so I take the chance because I refuse to put my life on hold because of some nutjob. If my stalker shows up with a gun, I hope you have one too, because I’m a student, so I’m not allowed to protect myself on campus.
Hey getalife, disagree, disagree means there is something to debate, and the government data and simple facts show unequivicably that people who carry concealed are not a risk, contrary to Daniels ka ka claims. So there is nothing to debate.
Daniel wrote a pathetic piece of schiite supported by nothing but emotional ka ka and used his bully pulpit to insult the intelligence of all those who know so much more about this subject than some wet behind the ears college student.
His was not a debate, so maybe you should get a freaking clue as to what a debate entails, you know FACTS, none of which Daniel presented in any fashion.
In fact, Daniels heroes, the anti gun crowd, don’t have the balls to face people like me in an open debate not of their choosing as they would be shown to be utter idiots from their complete and utter lack of facts to support their position, just like Daniels.
This is not a discussion, no solutions to violence were offered, no methods of changing mankinds predisposition to violence, all Daniel stated was he and a few minority are afraid of something they can’t see and have no evidence to prove there is a risk.
If you are stupid enough to publish such unsubstantiated ka ka like Daniel did, then in a real world, where exists our first amendment rights of free speach, expect to be challenged and ridiculed as we are perpetually tired of hearing such blatant ka ka from such unenlightened sources as COLLEGE STUDENTS. So grow up and get a thicker skin as real life is not politically correct or quit posting such biased ka ka.
 Of course you could actually  counter all the data above with real government facts and you could make me eat crow, then again, hell would have to freeze over for that to happen little boy.
So how about you accept the challenge and debunk the data I presented or go find some topless bar stool and sit and rotate little child!
it seems the authors argument against guns on campus is that it disrupts the fung shui that is so pivital in the aquireing of higher knowledge
The author writes: “Both Seung-Hui Cho, the Virginia Tech shooter, and Jared Lee Loughner, the Tucson shooter, purchased their guns legally. ”
This statement is false.  Both individuals LIED when filling out the required BATF Form 4473.
Seung-Hui Cho falsely answered “No” to Question 11.f. – “Have you ever been adjucated mentally defective(which includes having been adjudicated incompetent to manage your own affairs) or have been committed to a mental institution?”  In fact, according to CNN, “A Virginia judge in December 2005 deemed Cho “an imminent danger to himself because of mental illness” and ordered outpatient treatment for him, according to court documents.”
Jared Lee Loughner falsely answered “No” to Question 11.e. – “Are you an unlawful user of, or addicted to, marijuana or any depressant, stimulant, or narcotic drug, or any other controlled substance?” It is well documented that Loughner was a self admitted “habitual marijuana user.”
Both individuals are criminals that committed a felony by providing false information in order to illegally purchase a firearm.
“It has been replaced in the public debate by the misguided idea, pushed aggressively by the National Rifle Association, that more liberal gun laws will reduce violence by allowing innocents to defend themselves.”
I’d like you to supply one shred of evidence that this idea is misguided.
Thank you.
There are already 71 campuses in three separate states (Utah, Colorado, W.Virginia) that allow concealed carry on campus with Utah having allowed campus carry for the last 5 years, and the grand total of crimes committed either by, or against a concealed carrier is exactly ZERO.
Also, the tide is changing because people are starting to realize that gun laws do not work and our idealistic nanny state will not protect them.  Dependence on the government to keep us safe at all times is a loosing proposition.  If someone is not willing to engage in self-preservation then their genes will be swept aside as they rightfully should.
“The Texas state legislature recently introduced a bill that would allow students to carry concealed firearms on college campuses.”
The first sentence of this article is inaccurate, misleading, and it is what takes the discussion in the wrong direction.
This bill has almost nothing to do with students.  It would remove the prohibition on adults who have carry permits from carrying on campus.  These are the same adults (you must be 21 to get the permit) who currently carry in movie theaters, restaurants, and everywhere else, with very little in the way of problems.   Students who are 21 and have the permit can currently carry all over town.  So can 55-year olds.  This is the group of people who would be able to carry on campus — safely and responsibly, just as they currently do.
It distracts the discussion to say this bill allows students to carry.  It just removes the ban for the hundreds of thousands who currently carry everywhere else.
The anti-gun lefties are always whining about the existence of the 2nd amendment.  What these idiots will never realize is the 1st and 4th amendments they hold so dear will vanish without the 2nd.  
BTW, there is no mention of race or slavery in the Bill of Rights, so bringing issues in from elsewhere in the Constitution is a trite argument as those issues could all be addressed through future amendments.  That’s why they laid it out this way.  DUH!
Campus Police officer point of view:
Licensees can be armed in city libraries, but on campus we prefer to create a situation of giving easy access to guns to criminals? That doesn’t make sense.
If you were a campus police officer on a call to a burglary of a vehicle in progress, would you prefer to walk up to a burglar holding a bunch of CDs and an I-Pad, or holding a gun a Licensee had to store in his car while he runs into the library?
Let the Licensee who carries daily in a secured concealed holster keep his or her weapon secured and concealed, not in a car for a criminal to take.
Passing the campus carry bills will aid in keeping guns out of the wrong (criminals’) hands.
Exactly!
Here’s the problem in Texas:
Motor Vehicle burglary crimes have steadily increased on all campuses.
Current policy requires that Licensees can carry their gun all over Campus, but must store it in their car while in a class or Library or building.
Sec. 46.035 TEXAS Penal Code
f) In this section:
(3) “Premises” means a building or a portion of a building. The term does not include any public or private driveway, street, sidewalk or walkway, parking lot, parking garage, or other parking area.
Guns are allowed on Campuses already and always have been. It’s only inside the buildings that they are prohibited.
It is 100% more likely that my car would be broken into and my gun stolen, than someone reaching into my pants inside a classroom to steal a concealed gun they didn’t even know was there which is safely holstered and retained by a reinforced belt. (Sadly, I can’t even remember the last time anyone in a classroom reached into my pants to try to grab anything concealed in there)
Current policy gives criminals easier access to guns.  70% of gun crimes are committed with stolen guns.
This bill needs to pass, it’s just common sense.
Ray Hunt, the 2nd vice-president of the Houston Police Officers’ Union, 
the largest police union in the state of Texas, spoke out in favor of 
legalizing licensed concealed carry (of handguns) on Texas college 
campuses and dismissed the notion that the presence of armed citizens 
would somehow cause chaos or confusion during or following a campus 
shooting.
He also mentioned that the union had been originally fairly anti-CHL, 
fearing shootings of CHL-holders by police amongst other things. Upon 
seeing that that hadn’t occurred at all, they were happy to throw their 
support behind the concept of CHL in general, and they now specifically 
support concealed-carry on campus.
It isn’t hard to tell a person walking desk to desk executing people 
from a CHL hiding under a desk waiting his turn so he can shoot upwards 
at the shooter and any bullet passing through the shooter hits the 
ceiling instead of other students on the floor.  Police are trained for 
shoot-no shoot situations.
The current status quo of forcing responsible adults who conceal a 
weapon safely every day store it in a car to go into the library on 
campus, just provides easier access to guns for criminals. 70% of gun 
crimes are committed with stolen guns.
If I were a Police Officer, I’d rather respond to a car burglary and 
find someone holding a bunch of CDs, than a gun someone had to store 
there.
If the largest group of Police in Texas who encounter licensees on 
almost a daily basis during very stressful traffic stops etc. support 
it, it must be a good idea.   It’s just common sense.
When guns are outlawed
Only Outlaws will have guns…
What will be outlawed next? knives? glass?
You Dream World lefties are Pathetic.
When weeds are destroying your lawn,
They must be killed, not talked to !!!
Hey Daniel?
We tried it your way at Virginia Tech.  Even with cops on campus (investigating the two earlier murders) response time was 9 minutes and all the shooting was over.  During Cho’s rampage he encountered over 100 students.  In most states, about 2% of the population is licensed to carry, thus, had the students not been disarmed by the school’s rules, there’s a good chance one or more students would have been armed and able to respond to his attack.
I don’t understand why you have a problem with people being able to defend themselves.
We don’t live in a cotton candy and sugar plum world.  There are real bad guys out there who want to do real bad things to innocent people.  YOU don’t have a solution.  Those who advocate campus carry DO have a solution.
As I said, we tried it your way and 30 people were executed.  Excuse us if we consider your bleating about “learning and trust” irrelevant to the adult discussion of how to stop bloody massacres of young adults.
What’s even scarier than this proposed legislation is the fact that people at USC apparently support it…
And that is an ignorant comment. There is nothing scary about this, and any thinking person, who reads these comments, would understand that.
This just in: even scarier: people support people who support this dumb law. I think a thinking person like Diane should know how to use commas.
The fact actually is that students in Utah can carry concealed handguns into all of the colleges and universities there, and have been doing so.  There have been no serious problems as a result. Those who can legally carry firearms onto Utah campuses must be concealed carry permit holders who must also undergo strict criminal background checks. Student permit holders are like the rest of those in the country who are licensed to carry. They are among the most law abiding. 
School shootings are rare; however, they do happen. And, when they do they are horrendous and make spectacular news stories. But, the frequency of guns on campus and concealed carry licenses have no relationship to past shootings on college campuses.
A “No guns allowed policy” will not stop a determined killer. Post all the “No Guns Allowed” signs you can print. Do you believe that campus police will arrive on time when a mass killing is underway or completed? They haven’t been able to do that yet. It takes time to get to a crime scene unless they are already at the building, as unlikely as that is. 
Seung Hui-Cho didn’t have a license to carry  a gun when he used his to kill 32 people at “gun free” Virginia Tech. But, he did show disturbing signs symptoms of severe mental illness that many people including college staff at the school noticed, but did not report to authorities. All students could do was to try to hide under their desks as he walked down the rows and murdered them. 
At Northern Illinois University, Steven Kazmierczak had no gun carry permit and was off his Xanax and Prozak when he killed 5 people and wounded 21 others. He graduated high school in 1998 and was hospitalized for mental illness at a Psychiatric Center. A gun free policy did not stop him. 
The only common thread  in these university killings is  that they all took place in “gun free” zones like USC. At Applachian School of Law, a former student came on campus and shot several people, killing some. He was still crazily waving his loaded gun around when two armed students stopped him with their own handguns.
College students are not at risk from those who carry legally. They are at risk from the likes of Seung Hui-Cho and Steven Kazmierczak. 
God forbid that some law abiding person, who had undergone a criminal background check, carrying a licensed, concealed handgun might have been in the classrooms at Virginia Tech and N.I.U. Someone could have been seriously hurt.
“I certainly would not be happy with the knowledge that a classmate is carrying a gun, even if he is licensed to have it.”
-You would not know that someone is carrying becasue it is concealed.
“that more liberal gun laws will reduce violence by allowing innocents to defend themselves.”
-that is true, look at the statastics, Texas CHL holders are the most law abiding citizens and areas with high CHL holders deter criminals, according to Texas DPS reports on CHL conviction rates.
“More guns possibly could have prevented the Virginia Tech or Tucson shootings, but they might also would lead to new acts of violence that otherwise would not have happened.”
-Colorado and Utah have allowed students to carry on campus for years now and they have not had one incident realted to firearms being carried on campus
You can use all the if’s/and’s/but’s you want, the true is that everyone should have the right to protect themselves from crazy people on a mission to kill. The only way to do that is to allow people to carry; police can not be everywhere at the exact right time. Gun free zones are nothing but shooting gallaries for people that want to create a mass shooting.
So you recommend that women walking back from class late at night ask rapists to just respect them and that should stop them. How dare you disarm someone with your thoughts about what is right. If we practiced that argument on any other right I am sure you would be calling foul. But since you don’t personally agree with the right to bear arms this one is OK. Also I would be fine with a gun free campus if there was full security screens at all entrances with armed security guards checking people in and out. But by posting little signs with a gun crossed out you are creating a false promise of protection and I think any damages that are caused by criminal acts where a law abiding citizen is harmed should be payed for by the College that chose to dictate everyones best means of self defense. It’s easy to bang up a sign it’s hard when you have to pay for promising fake protection.
The first amendment is more of an anarchism than anything as words have led to more deaths than anything in the world. Or do you believe that religious zealotry has not been the leading cause of deaths throughout history?
What about all the propaganda the Germans used to demonize and desensitize the public to killing the Jews?
So since words and ideas are more dangerous, we should eliminate the anarchism that is the first amendment eh little wet behind the ears little boy?
Oh, fyi, your free to state your opinion, just as everyone else is free to respond to your public ka ka and detail what an idiot you are!
Poor little wet behind the ears little boy hasn’t a clue as to the real world, referred to in the future as “the one”
The one where the US government, BATF, judges, prosecuting attorneys, police, and doctors, fail to enforce the background check more than 1% of the time. USDOJ Background Check & Firearm Transfer report 2008.
The one where the state &  federal courts have ruled ten times the police are not legally liable to protect the individual citizen.
The one where the US vs Haynes Supreme Court ruling 390, 85, 1968 ruled that people were not legally liable to follow a law requiring them to violate their 5th amendment right of no self incrimination making 85% of gun control laws not applicable to felons.
The one where the police only solve 8.75% of all violent crimes FBI UCR & USDOJ National Victimization report 2008.
The one where where the 700k doctors in the US in a JAMA 2001 Medical Malpractice report, killed 44k to 98k people per year (.065 to .14 deaths avg)
The one where the best the anti gun zealots can claim is 137 deaths from the 8 mil cpl licensee’s over a 3 year time frame in a VPC 2009 report. (Florida & Texas ccw government databases show this number to be less) or .00000562 deaths per licensee.
The one where when you compare doctors to people carrying concealed, doctors are 12,000 to 25,000 times more likely to kill you than a person carrying concealed. (.065 or .14) / .00000562 = 12,000 to 25,000.
The one where US Census shows 2008 where 18.4 mil students, 42% of whom 21 or older, went to 4,300 schools. Compared to the 4.3% of the population who have a cpl 8 mil BATF / 186 mil US Census 21 or older, we see you anti gun zealots will be exposed to 77 people in a school or 1.8% of the student population, who again is 12,000 to 25,000 times less likely to harm you than your doctor.
The one where fools who can’t even spot a criminal carrying concealed are crying chicken little about lawful abiding gun owners carrying concealed.
The one where the last ten mass shootings in gun free zones, we see the body count was ten times higher in the 5 that did not have any resistance. Ft Hood, Luby’s Cafeteria, Columbine, Va Tech, N Illinois.
Versus the 5 that had resistance at Pearl High School 1997, Appalachian Law school 2002, Shoney’s Alliston AL 1991, New Life Church Colorado 2007, College Station Georgia May 4th 2008.
The one where we see actual police and media reports collated in web sites like Keep & Bear Arms, KC3, A rmed Citizen, American Rifleman and many more showing 80 successful defensive gun uses a month, and 170 lives saved, not including injuries. Since the NRA or the 80 million law abiding gun owners do not own or manage the police departments, any claim of bias is the claim of a the village idiot.
All while the background check only prevents less than 1,500 people a year form acquiring a firearm and factored against the FBI UCR & CDC database, show maybe one death and 7 injuries prevented a year.
USDOJ Background Check & Firearm Transfer report 2008, DOJ Felons Firearm Use survey 1997, published Nov 2001.
The one where the US government acknowledges that 95% of deaths where a firearm was used, were committed by the career criminals/gang members, and the crazies who commit suicide. But hey it is morally acceptable to blame the the 80 mil law abiding gun owners and the NRA instead. USDOJ National Gang Threat Assessment 2009, CDC Database.
Too bad for little wet behind the ears little boys that all those government agencies, reports and independent studies exist proving that people who carry concealed are not a risk. If you don’t like this reality, well you can go to the responsible government agency and cry and wail to them.
So go home to mommy as your depends diapers, like your belief stinks from being full of schiite!

Oscar Garcia, a sophomore majoring in psychology who  transferred to USC this semester,  is one of a very small number of undocumented students on campus.
And, as he put it during a panel Monday night about the federal Development, Relief, and Education for Alien Minors Act, that is unacceptable.
The collective student action that has been taken to confront the structural barriers undocumented students face in today’s educational system demonstrates the importance of the act.
The DREAM Act is well known as the federal bill that would provide undocumented immigrants access to higher education and, eventually, legal citizenship. The federal bill failed to pass the Senate in December.
Lesser known is California’s version of the DREAM Act, which was first introduced in 2006 and addresses the inequalities undocumented students currently face in California.
The California DREAM Act is split into two parts, AB 130 and AB 131, in response to those who don’t agree with spending state dollars on illegal immigrants. AB 130 offers the students access to grants and aid administered by colleges, and would not cost the state a penny. AB 131, however,  would allow undocumented students to apply for state-funded Cal Grants.
If the California DREAM Act passes, undocumented students who graduate from California high schools will be able to access financial aid at  public institutions.
For undocumented students at USC, passage of the California bill might prompt university officials to offer similar access to aid in the form of grants and scholarships.  Such action would be a critical first step for students at private colleges struggling to pay much higher tuition.
Students have a wide variety of opinions about illegal immigration, the issue at the core of the DREAM Act. But what we can agree on is that bringing the act to the state level gives students more of a collective voice.
The action California students have taken in support of the DREAM Act is exciting, inspiring and necessary to propel the act forward.
This month, the UC Student Association gave out thousands of postcards addressed to Gov. Jerry Brown asking him to sign the bill into law this year. The organization hopes to collect 10,000 postcards signed by UC students and then deliver them to Sacramento. UCLA collected 500 postcards on the first day alone.
Here at USC, Garcia recently created the Organization for Undocumented Student Issues, a support and advocacy group for undocumented students. He spoke about the need for such a group at the event Monday evening, which was put on by the Latino, Black, and Political Student Assemblies as well as Improving Dreams, Equality, Access and Success (IDEAS),  a support network for undocumented students at UCLA.
Such demonstrations of student initiative indicate the potential power students hold to take the next step forward.
Since its creation in 2006, the California DREAM Act has been introduced, passed and then vetoed by Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger a total of three times. Brown, however, has voiced support for the act.
In light of this, and the current surge of student activism, maybe the fourth time is the charm.

By the way, how do undocumented students and illegal immigrants add to the “pool” when they legally do have a social security number and are “undocumented”? Is it because they steal social security numbers from people who are deceased?? Tell me, this law abiding taxpayer, how this is possible?? Are they breaking another law to add to the “pool” and to buy clothes, etc.?  How many other laws do they break that goes unnoticed for the pursuit of a higher education and to live in California? Tell me more.
This is about law abiding taxpayers protecting the dreams of their children who are citizens who have paid taxes for possibly generations in California. We want the DREAM saved for our children. What right do you have to feel entitled when our country is suffering from an economic crisis with Californians suffering from high unemployment. These families who are taxpayers are struggling to send their children to college becaue they pay taxes and report incomes to FAFSA. Why cut the budgets to California colleges and then turn around and give financial aid to undocumented students. This increases tuition for students. California taxpayers and students speak out against the DREAM Act.
its saddening what people say now a days, to many i am the innocent, i am merely a teenager, as soon as you read i am a “child” you will stop reading, but don’t. America is known for freedom and DREAMS, i am legally here for those of you wondering, and yet i still see no reason why you would want everyone who isn’t quite “legal” to leave. Honestly i do not understand the reasons, and i know i know, i do not pay taxes yet and i will in a while, but i have read many articles and have come to the conclusion that has remained the same! If you people are concerned in paying for “illegals” college your not, in the end it turns out that out of your own pocket you  gave, lets see no more than a $1.00, yea they’ll be thanking you for that. If you where in their situation, wouldn’t you want support, i mean those who apply for the dream act have to acquire certain criteria. They are no criminals; most of them where brought here as very young children, they didn’t really have the choice. I have to agree with educate yourself. Anyway we are all immigrants, our ancestors traveled here for the exact same reason everyone else is. So whats the positive side, its going to help America’s debt, and the dropout rates will decrease. Shouldn’t we all have the same rights? Or are we heading back to the same thing? I mean they do say history repeats itself, and I’ve heard some scary stories…
Oscar Garcia, i hope the best for you and wish you to obtain the support from others, i know i can not do much, but expressing myself is something, i give you the credit for speaking out, something to admire.
It is always going to be a blame game for the mismanagement of this country and exploitation of others. It’s all cause and effect. Open your eyes people! There’s this thing called GLOBALIZATION and if the United States didn’t want to be “burdened” they shouldn’t have taken the lead. Undocumented people in this country are for the most part paying taxes–taxes from which they don’t receive a cent back. So sorry to break it to you, undocumented people do pitch in to this pool of money. Even with purchases like groceries & clothing, they’re contributing to the economy. Allowing them to legalize their status would bring in a large amount of money as well in lawyers, paperwork and fees. It would also ensure that EVERYONE pays their taxes. 
Keep your head up Oscar Garcia. Mad props for speaking out and being unafraid at SC.
Keep hating hater. The cause will pass and this is an investment in long term, California will make 100x the profit when the undocumented students graduate! Get education before hating on other peoples rights.  Google up Texas Dream Act, it has already passed and Texas is more republican state than California.  Californians are freakin H.A.T.E.R.S.. like how Govana was last year.
I know the government is perfectly capable of ridding the country of these scumbags. I don’t care where they come from. they are unamerican, just like their parents. They should be locked up for life, through the expense of their home country.
Students who are citizens against ab 130 and 131 stand up and voice your opinion. If you don’t and these bills pass, you will be competing for financial aid from undocumented students who do not report income to FAFSA and in effect would take priority receiving financial aid. Another impact of giving financial aid is creating a huge incentive for undocumented students to attend our colleges thereby taking seats away from citizens! We don’t have space in our colleges to fund education for illegals! Do we really want to fund collleges which will end up educating undocumented students and paying for it as well instead of US citizens who would be second in priority! This is absolutely absurd! Brown is going to cut the college budgets which means higher tuition and possibly close a couple of campuses. Make college affordable for US citizens. California and US citizens wake up to this nonsense and speak up!
Our state is broke. Lets give money we don’t have to people who break the law!
Or better yet – let’s have schools give money to people who aren’t here legaally – when they could give it to someone who is.
This whole DREAM Act makes me ill.

Elena,
Just what is it about the word, “illegal” that you don’t understand?
JLH
Journ, ’58
Garcia – Stop complaining and apply to be a citizen.
This country is for free legal immigrants and native born only. I am a legal Mexican American and I know it is wrong for any race to illegally come here. Their kids should not be citizens either. Come on think if you came to Mexico, and had your kids there, do you think your kids would be called a Mexican or given Mexican birth certificate. NO! It is sad to watch so many illegal’s try to fraud this system. The simple facts are if they did not pay and wait like I did, then they should be deported to where ever they came from. Tell me if they get amnesty will I get my refund. Most legal American Latinos do not support this unless they have illegal relatives in their homes. I bet we should check all that voted for this Dream Act and you would see they are the criminals who are trying to cheat this system. How could we watch so many schools get closed and teachers getting fired, while we give free health care and WIC to these illegal people. It is sad because Americans like myself can’t even get freebies but so many of these illegals are, it makes me want to say I don’t have a SSN or instead of filling out a job application I should just say I’m illegal. Then I get the job even though it’s not a high wage I’m still getting paid right. Think long and hard mi familia. We don’t want America to become Mexico and then no one has a future but to watch drug cartels kill and kidnap our kids for ransom everyday. I say remove every illegal and california will not have to day 600 million dollars in WIC to illegals.
Word to Jose Lopez!!
Very very true!!
What? You have to be kidding. Illegals already get way too many government freebies (WIC, Section 8, Medi-Cal, Free School and school Lunches, etc.). Which is one reason why California is in the hole. Why are hard working Americans being force to foot yet another bill for someone who is here illegally? Most middle class Americans don’t qualify for any financial aid, but an illegal like this Mr. Garcia will likely qualify because illegals often do not report or report very little of what they make, so they almost always qualify for these grants. Yet, hard working middle class American families are forced to get loans and get in debt to fund their kids’ education. When is enough, enough? Where the hell did these people get such sense of entitlement? Why do they think we are obligated to give them give them, give them? If you go to Mexico illegally, you get deported (if not raped, killed or held for ransom) and you sure as hell aren’t getting any free housing, free education, free food stamps, or free anything anything. Or in any other country for that matter. I lived this France last summer, there, the police randomly goes around in the subway asking for papers to prove you are there legally, if you don’t have them, you get arrested and deported. I was shocked. And they complain about Arizona? At least Arizona only asks for papers if you are stopped for breaking the law. No wonder the world thinks we are stupid and no wonder everyone wants to come here.
Something is really wrong with California when it is 30 billion dollars in the hole and yet can find  money to spend state dollars on illegal immigrants.
Why is Garcia not being deported if he is openly admitting that he is here in violation of the law? How DARE he attempt to advocate for more lawbreakers. That’s appalling.
Garcia says it’s “unacceptable” that he is one of a very small number of undocumented students on campus. So, it’s acceptable that he’s taking a slot, using taxpayer dollars (in his  grants/scholarships), that  a qualified American student citizen will not be eligible to receive? It sounds to me like rewarding those who break the law. AJ

Forever the Sickest Kids’ second full-length album is officially available in stores everywhere and on iTunes.
The Texas natives first hit the scene with an EP titled Television Off, Party On, in 2007 and later released their first full-length album, Under Dog Alma Mater, in April of 2008.
After the success of Under Dog and several tours in the states and the United Kingdom, the band’s next step was to write more music. At first, it was a little unclear what the band had in store. The band announced their plan to release a collection of three mini-LPs. The first, The Weekend: Friday, was released in November of 2009, but the other two, The Weekend: Saturday and The Weekend: Sunday, fell to the wayside.
Instead of following the LP route, FTSK’s frontman, Jonathan Cook, announced on his tumblr that they would instead release a full-length album. The reason? According to FTSK’s official tumblr, they found themselves wanting to record more than a few songs.
The sound of their self-titled album is very similar to Under Dog.. With new songs named “Keep On Bringing Me Down,” “Bipolar Baby!” and “What Happened to Emotion (Killing Me),” listeners would expect mellow and morbid tracks but FTSK has continued to turn bad situations into a upbeat tunes though.
Even after the loss of their keyboardist Kent Garrison this past January, nothing seems to be bringing them down. In one day, their new album became one of the top ten albums on iTunes. The band are currently touring with pop punk veterans, Good Charlotte.

Saddle up, partner.
Quentin Tarantino has been itching to make a Western and he’s one step closer to having his dreams realized.
MTV News recently reported that the writer and director best known for Pulp Fiction and Kill Bill is said to have already completed the screenplay for his desired Western. Inglourious Basterds, his most recent film, reportedly took a decade to come to fruition, but t this time the screenplay seems to have “flowed out of him,” Deadline reported.
The Weinstein Company, fresh off their win for Best Picture with The King’s Speech, will reportedly start looking for a production start date when the screenplay is delivered.
Quentin Tarantino has expressed his desires in the past for making a spaghetti Western that deals with American slavery and the recent success of True Grit at the box office shows that audiences seem ready and willing to see those good old American Westerns again.
