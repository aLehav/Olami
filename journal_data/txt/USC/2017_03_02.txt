I lived alone for a month last May. I was impressed with myself because I kept the apartment impeccably clean. Having no other people there made me feel accountable for each crumb or shirt off a hanger. 
I didn’t have much to do while my friends were out of town. Cleaning the apartment kept me busy after work. And for one weekend, Rick kept me busy too.
 He and I matched on Tinder and I knew I recognized him immediately. I texted our one mutual friend, my childhood best friend Anna and asked where I knew him from. “Did you guys hook up in high school?”
 “No,” she wrote back, “but we were in the same friend group in Jordan.” 
I was in the clear. I swiped right and immediately messaged him, “Anna says ‘hi.’”
 We had a quick conversation about how I used to visit Jordan every spring, our favorite spots in Amman, and what a small world it was. 
The conversation stopped but I didn’t think much of it until Anna texted me a screen grab a few days later. Rick’s old phone had broken and he wanted my number so he could ask me on a date.
 On the first date, knowing me, I probably should have been more put off by his cigarette smoking and stick-and-poke tattoos. On the second date, when I went to see him, I should have thought more about him living with his parents, or that he paused for a break to roll a joint after sex.
 None of these were clues that Rick was what I was looking for. But I was bored, working alone in D.C. with an impeccably clean and empty apartment, and I thought Rick might fill my time as the clock ticked down until my friends arrived in town.
 But after standing me up three times in one week, Rick was out of the picture. I do not take sex lightly. And I knew I’d made a mistake.
 For the next three months, I followed a set of self-imposed rules so that I could get to know myself better. I stopped swiping on dating apps. I only opened them up occasionally as a joking social interaction with my guy friends. I didn’t go on any dates. 
This means I didn’t seek out dates or accept any.  I wouldn’t have sex. I could still kiss boys occasionally and dance in bars, but I needed to take some time off to figure out what was negotiable and what wasn’t. 
I knew I’d miss the physical aspect, but I hadn’t yet figured out what I wanted from guys, or how to demand these things once I figured it out. I met Sam one night at a bar. 
He was much taller than me and — for a guy at a bar — quite impressive. He was an Amherst grad; we knew some of the same people from my New England connections. He played baseball there, and I could tell his body was still chiseled under his linen shirt. He was working his way through law school as a baseball coach for kids in D.C., and he didn’t pressure me to exist anywhere in his life outside of the bar.
 The first time I met him, I told him I had to leave with my friends, pulled away from him,and giggled the entire walk home. 
All spring, the men I encountered had left me wanting more without a trace. But that night, although in the most micro sense, I had reversed that role. He had my number, and for a while we had a nice thing going. 
We’d text only on weekends, only past a certain time, and meet at bars. He’d joke around with my friends and me, we’d make out and I’d leave when I felt like it — but never with him.
 Eventually, he asked me on a date. After almost three months, the summer without boys was beginning to wear on me, so I caved and said yes. 
My friends knew I was on the break, so they gently asked if it was a good idea. I said I’d only do it if I were sure. So when that Saturday rolled around, and I realized how few weekends left I had with my friends in the city, I canceled on Sam. All of the sudden I knew what I wanted.
 My break stopped when I got back to Los Angeles this fall. I went on a date my second day back. By the third date, and the question of sex came around, I clearly listed my expectations: no one night stands, no sleeping around with too many other people and total honesty. 
When that agreement stopped working and I started to want exclusivity, I had that conversation too. When it didn’t work, I moved on to the next boy. Knock on wood, I haven’t experienced a shock like Rick since.

The USC Thornton Baroque Sinfonia will perform a series of early modern European pieces at the Newman Recital Hall on Friday night. 
The Baroque Sinfonia is a period instrument ensemble that specializes in music from the 17th to mid-18th century. Adam Gilbert, an associate professor at USC Thornton School of Music, will be leading the Sinfonia.
The Sinfonia is made up of graduate and undergraduate students who are apart of USC’s early music program. These 25 members perform four times a year at USC and have played across the country, in addition to having been featured on NPR for their talents. 
This event will include myriad different sounds and instruments, including a seven-member band made of baroque oboes, bassoons, and guitars, the violin and viola da gamba, recorders and renaissance trombones, with additional vocal components.
The Sinfonia is known for mixing different cultures and musical styles during their performances. One of the most popular performances hosted by the ensemble was an event through Visions and Voices. In this performance, Italian bagpipes, an instrument that has exerted much influence on baroque and classical music, was featured with the Sinfonia.
Friday’s performance will have two main elements. The first is improvisation, something that the ensemble has never done onstage before. These techniques  are a recreation of the improvisations that began in the 1500s until the baroque period during the 17th and 18th centuries. Four major chord progressions will be repeated with players extemporizing with every chord change by building upon the previous one. 
The program will open with André Campra’s Entree and Chaconne from Les Fetes Vénitiennes. Other pieces include Romanesca, which comprises of similar underlying harmonies to the popular Greensleeves; Juan de Araujo’s The Canario, a folk harmony poking fun at the country people of Northern Italy; and Portuguese villancico Sa qui turo, a common poetic and musical work in the late 15th century. 
The performance will close with improvisations of Gabriel Garcia de Mendoza’s Moderno that features sounds from Moorish dances and A siolos molenas. 
“The perform will be joyful,” Gilbert said. “It is very rousing, toe-tapping music. We are having a conversation with people who have made music hundreds of years ago.” 
Gilbert specializes in 15th- century music and has directed the Early Music Program since 2006. 
The second component of the performance is the European perceptions on African dialects, done through three
villancicos, a unique type of vocal typical of Spanish and Portuguese Christmas songs. 
These villancicos are a European mimicry of the
Afro-Spanish and Afro-Portuguese dialects of the African slaves and are based on the songs of the shepherds who were the first to greet the Angel and announce the birth of Jesus. 
These mixed African and Spanish chord progressions are akin to those heard in today’s pop music. 
Though these pieces are so varied with different histories, they are all joyous pieces that will celebrate the diversity of the music of the period. 
“When the audience leaves, we want them to feel less tired and more excited,” Gilbert said. “Music should make people feel like they are part of a community and rejuvenated. Even though the music we are doing is centuries old, every time we play, we are bringing the piece back again.”
The Baroque Sinfonia will showcase this unique blend of music of different cultures this Friday at 8 p.m. The performance will last for 70 minutes and is free for all.

It’s not hard to find great coffee in Los Angeles. In Downtown, a high-end coffee bar, low-key diner or chaotic Starbucks are never more than a few hundred meters away from each other, and more are popping up every month. 
What is rare, however, is a truly unique coffee experience, and Tilt Coffee Bar offers just that. In a sea of competitors, Tilt differentiates itself with a gorgeous location, quality ingredients and its one-of-a-kind signature drink, the cloud mocha.
 Tucked behind a wall of apartments on the corner of 4th and Main Streets, the small coffee bar is situated on a grassy courtyard with striking views of the L.A. skyline.
 The interior is small, sleekly designed and airy, with stainless steel accents and a warm-colored wooden bar, but the wide expanse of outdoor seating gives customers plenty of room to enjoy their coffee and pastries.
 The intentional design and higher-range prices — most small drinks were around $4 — signal that this is not a simple coffee shop for a quick caffeine fix. Rather, it’s more well-suited for sitting and savoring a drink, and the sun-drenched patio is perfect for lounging with a latte on a slow afternoon.
 Tilt serves a full menu of espresso drinks and filter coffee from Heart Coffee Roasters in Portland, Ore. as well as teas from San Francisco-based Red Blossom Teas, and sells pastries from DTLA mainstay Bread Lounge.
 Owners Suk Hong and Kyu Choi opened Tilt on the last day of 2016. The two decided to open a shop together after Hong left the world of architecture design — although he did design the shop’s warm interior — and work with Choi, a decorated barista with six years of experience in the L.A. coffee scene.
 As they developed the concept for the shop, Choi traveled to Canada, Japan and Korea for research and development. A particular experience in a Korean coffee shop soon developed into Tilt’s signature drink.
“Korea has a lot of differently styled cafes with dessert coffee or different focuses in their coffee shops,” Choi said. “I ordered hot coffee, but there was cold cream inside of it, and I was like ‘Wow, this is very unique.’” 
 Intrigued by the idea of contrasting a cold, creamy element with a warm, bitter one, he began experimenting.
 “I just bought tons of milk and tried it myself, and I just made it up,” Choi said. “I didn’t ask them for any recipe, I just imagined it in my palate and tried tons of different things.”
 The resulting drink, called the cloud mocha, is made with warm espresso, milk and chocolate, with a dollop of cold, lightly whipped cream added in a large white dot in the center of the cup. 
The cloud mocha is served in a small, eight ounce cup, while its counterpart, the cloud latte is comparably larger.
As with all great coffee drinks, the first sip is the best: The hot and cold elements enter the mouth simultaneously, contrasting each other before mixing into a sweet froth.
“A lot of people are really surprised because of that contrast, it’s very unique and only Tilt has it,” said Choi, who made it to the quarterfinals of the Latte Art World Championship Open in October 2016. 
He said that he named the drink because of its unique presentation. 
“The creamy white part is like a little white cloud floating on top of the coffee,” Choi said. “It’s kind of a cute name.”
An iced version, the cloud latte, is also available, and features a layer of cream and ice floating above the espresso in a tall glass. In the cloud latte, the chocolate is replaced by maple syrup, creating a more traditional, less dessert-like flavor. 
Though the latte is iced and will surely attract overheated customers in the coming spring months, the warm, original cdloud mocha should not be passed over. 
“I made the cloud mocha first and then a lot of people wanted iced coffee because L.A. is usually so hot,” Choi said.
Because of the contrasting temperatures within the signature drink, the cloud mocha stands out in comparison to the latte. The flavor from the cloud latte is not as impressionable; its taste is comparable to lattes found in other L.A. coffee joints.
 Together, the cloud mocha and the cloud latte are two of the most unique and enjoyable cups of coffee in Los Angeles.
 “These two are new to the community,” Hong said. “There is no drink like this in L.A., and that’s really compelling for coffee lovers.” 
 Combined with the peaceful location in the midst of downtown’s bustling core, Tilt Coffee Bar is an essential experience for any coffee nerd in search of a truly unparalleled cup.

Let’s not bury the lede. President Donald Trump’s address to Congress was an embarrassing display not only of the rookie nature of our Home Depot-colored pseudo-president, but also of the vast lock-step cultishness of the Republican establishment. In their inimitable fashion, they have continued to tout anything that wasn’t a total blunder as “presidential” — funny, considering that just a few years back, former President Barack Obama could quite literally win a Nobel Peace Prize only to be met with Republican claims that they saw Goody Proctor with Obama’s fake birth certificate. But now, in the calm, warm days of a white president, the leader of the free world can debate the size of his inauguration crowd for weeks on end, suddenly tell Congress on a given Tuesday that the “trivial fights” need to end and then be called the most presidential president ever to occupy the presidency. In fact, I’m almost sure  senior adviser Kellyanne Conway said exactly that. If not, call it an alt-quote.
Here’s the cold truth: Donald Trump is lying to you about the problems, the plans and the administration, right through his teeth. And any college student who hopes to be an educated adult — including my beloved California conservatives — should not be here for it. Trump’s speech was falsified, directionless, largely accusatory, desperate and sad. It was not “presidential.” It was a national embarrassment. 
Trump began his speech by justifying his disastrous half-baked plans, essentially by reading the smudged writing on his hand: “Jobs, Muslims, Guns, Chicago.” Of course, all the reasoning comes straight out of the usual Republican playbook — lie, embellish and terrify. Tell your supporters that everyone’s getting shot, getting poorer and getting terrorized by scary brown people with beards. 
“The murder rate in 2015 experienced its largest single-year increase in nearly half a century,” said the tall, sweating glass of Tropicana Freshly Squeezed, describing the increase in murder rate from 4.4 people per 100,000 to a staggering 4.9. The president then went on to describe exactly how many people were shot in Chicago last year — rudely failing to address the reasons behind his feverish preoccupation with the Windy City. Perhaps, while House Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, barefoot Conway and Russian President Vladimir Putin are busy running the country, Trump’s been enjoying the racy fourth season of Chicago PD. 
Of course, Trump also made sure to touch on jobs, touting the “tens of thousands” of them being created by Keystone XL and the Dakota Access Pipeline. The real figure is 1,950 temporary and 30 permanent full-time jobs, according to experts cited by CNN. He also did his usual song-and-dance around terrorism, claiming that nearly all terrorist activity in the United States is perpetrated by foreigners — a lie substantiated only by a study conducted by our dear friend Attorney General Jeff Sessions, whose research sociologists found to be 42 percent fabricated. Come to think of it, Sessions hasn’t been the most trustworthy source as of late. How very odd. 
Finally, he got to his actual plan — and there aren’t many specifics. But then again, it’s hard to iron everything out when you’re busy bogeying through those 18 holes at Mar-a-Lago every weekend. Perhaps he intends to intimidate his communications staff with his drive? Judging from what he was able to eke out in between the Republican establishment’s 53 standing ovations, immigration is the priority on the agenda. Trump’s idea of shooing out immigrants is economically disastrous (by the billions), spectacularly racist and also vastly unachievable without draining taxpayer dollars for a war on labor the country needs. 
And this is all information Trump probably knows, considering he’s softened his stance on immigration considerably. But what the heck — let’s flip flop. Let’s lie.
Then, of course, there was the base-level call for school vouchers, another way to royally ruin the public education that the middle and working classes so desperately rely on — of course eliciting a big standing ovation from the party of Pizzagate and hatred. Betsy DeVos was sure to clap her very hardest, probably Googling the term “school voucher” as soon as everyone sat back down.
By the way, another fun activity the Trump administration has been up to this week: Championing the proposed repeal of the Cardin-Lugar Act, which prevented global corruption by requiring transparency in payments to foreign governments. I’m sure Vlad is pleased. 
This speech was not “presidential.” I am hard-pressed to find any evidence that the speech was given by a man who is fully aware he is the president at all. His new, measured persona was contradicted immediately by extremist actions taken behind the scenes. His new tone of calm should fool none but those who were already deceived on and before Election Day.
Lily Vaughan is a sophomore majoring in history and political science. Her column,“Playing Politics,” runs every Friday.
The term “astonishingly deceptive” is a wild exaggeration. Trump’s address did not include any deception as massive as, “If you like your plan, you can keep your plan.”
Lol, name calling and conclusory statements are not arguments. She cited a couple of facts at most, hardly a cogent opinion. Next!
Don’t hold back tell us how you really feel, It’s always fun to read a snowflake opinion just make’s my day to know that when you leave school ( aka your safe place ) that life is going to hit you square in the face and you won’t know which way is up.
You’re doing it too. This post is the mirror image of her article, as far as tone and sentiment go. You two should get a room.
awww did I hurt someone’s feelings with my ‘ tone and sentiment ‘ ? Guess I better give myself a time out.
This editorial proved that you need to get out more, talk to more people, read a wider variety of news media, work harder to obtain facts to substantiate your point of view, and realize that the World is a little more complicated than you currently think.  While the prose was colorful, it was sadly disappointing in content.
This piece is what happens when a young mind is brainwashed and indoctrinated by the left; crucial, formative years for someone her age.  They have no idea whatsoever that there are alternative approaches that might prove better for the American public.  Of course, it doesn’t help to be taught by leftists who are not fair and objective when teaching politics, economics, and social sciences.  It’s really sad when you stop and think about how many in her cohort “think” the exact same way.
Writing like this just entrenches us. It’s bad for discourse and it stops dialogue in its tracks.  Worse, it’s bad for the soul of the reader. It dries out the heart. 
I don’t like him either but man are you trivial in your accusations. Editorials like these make me embarrassed to be a democrat. Stop being so emotionally charged against him and leave absolutely zero room for admitting his pros. 
I don’t know where to begin with attack dogs.  Her perception of reality is astonishingly tainted.  This is another primal scream.  Sad….really.
There is too much vitriol in this piece, and too many ad hominem attacks, to be effective.  When you open with:
 “Let’s not bury the lede. President Donald Trump’s address to Congress was an embarrassing display not only of the rookie nature of our Home Depot-colored pseudo-president, but also of the vast lock-step cultishness of the Republican establishment. In their inimitable fashion, they have continued to tout anything that wasn’t a total blunder as ‘presidential'”
… the reader knows that everything that follows is emotionally driven and therefore probably not an objective analysis of the speech.  If you want to people to take your writing seriously, you need to be more professional in your approach.
Concur. Effective political commentary acknowledges the merits of the other side, be they limited or otherwise, in order to establish the reasonableness of the counterargument that follows. No place for vitriol at any of our newspapers or TV stations or other specialty media properties. Grade D-.
Agreed.
Well-Said.  I totally agree.  The language used in this piece doesn’t even meet the codes of conduct and civility required of those posting public comments.

On Wednesday, USC announced that tuition for the 2017-2018 academic year will rise by roughly 3.93 percent of the current total. In its press release, the University marked the tuition increase as a five-year low, while highlighting increases in the financial aid offered.
“USC’s average net tuition is ranked 134th out of all private, nonprofit four-year universities thanks to its generous financial aid packages,” the press release stated. “The new charges for undergraduate tuition during the 2017-18 academic year will total $53,448.”
The University’s treatment of the perennial tuition hikes begs an examination of what administrative transparency should look like. Instead of misleading students with positive messaging surrounding the ever-increasing price tag, USC should respect the immense challenge of college affordability by clearly highlighting where students’ tuition dollars go.
While the press release did not contain technical inaccuracies, it is worth noting that crucial context was excluded. In terms of transparency, the University is moving in the right direction by disclosing this increase in tuition, as opposed to years past when students were greeted with a rude awakening of thousands of dollars in additional tuition costs upon opening up their USC e-bill. 
But improved communication means little for students who fail to see what they are receiving for paying more. Though the end-of-year budget report details University expenses, the press release says little about the justification for rising tuition besides reaffirming USC’s commitment to financial aid. 
Despite the fact that the 3.93 percent tuition increase is low for USC, it is above the 3.6 percent average tuition increase by private colleges, according to data published by the College Board. Meanwhile, the median family income did not grow at all from the beginning to the end of 2016, forcing families to shoulder the growing costs of college with little means to do so.
As a private university, USC is certainly not legally obligated to divulge the allocations of its funds. However, the onus is on the University to set a precedent among other institutions to be forthright about their investments with student money.
USC should look to other universities as a model for tuition transparency. For example, when Point Park University experienced a 3.9 percent tuition hike for the 2015-2016 academic year, the university president released a statement explaining that the increased cost of attendance would support “financial aid, core curriculum, staffing new courses, a program to help freshmen to graduate on time, campus WiFi, campus safety and campus service upgrades.” 
A transparent USC would not only say where students’ money is going, but provide hard numbers to show why a tuition increase is justified. Our tuition also undoubtedly contributes to tenured professors and administrative salaries and funding for athletic programs — all of which are on the rise for universities as a whole. But expansion projects at the University, such as the construction of the USC Village, leave students wondering how much tuition funds new buildings and amenities. These questions were fully ignored in the press release.
Additionally, while USC’s focus on affordability for low-income students is laudable, the University ranks 10th in terms of highest tuition among all private schools. And tuition is far from the only cost of attending an elite university. Rising costs of additional expenses such as books, housing and food should not be kept nebulous but rather clearly delineated, especially in Los Angeles, where standards of living are high.
Even with generous financial aid, many Trojans struggle to cover basic necessities, much less keep up with tuition increases. Regardless, higher education should be a right, not a privilege afforded to the most affluent in order to thrive in today’s competitive economy. Research shows that obtaining a college degree today is the educational equivalent of receiving a high school diploma during our parents’ generation. The contrast, however, is that a high school diploma does not come with a $70,000-plus contingency. The least the University can do is to inform students what they signed up for.
Given these realities, the statement released yesterday missed the mark. It failed to paint a realistic picture of what it means to attend USC — one that, for many students, is saddled with economic burdens.

I think we can all agree that nobody wants to be a freshman in college forever. Sure, it is the beginning of the most exciting experience of your life up until that point and within the first few days and weeks of school, there is the possibility that you’ve met lifelong friends. With all that said, there are a lot of downsides. You don’t know where your classes are, you don’t know anyone in your classes and you don’t know what the status quo is for anything.
Welcome to studying abroad.
While all my friends at USC and in the States have been in full midterm mode, I was back to feeling like a freshman during my first week on campus. Walking around with a map pulled up on my phone, I was trying hard to avoid bumping into anyone while I tried to make sense of a maze of buildings on a city campus.
It’s interesting to have such a similar experience two years later though because while I was terrified of walking into class alone as a freshman at USC, here I was able to just cruise in and take a seat. These little differences in my confidence and demeanor have made me so proud of myself for continuing to grow and push my comfort zone in college.
This week I also gained a new appreciation for what international students go through when they come to USC for their first semester. Going to a new country makes everything different, even buying school supplies. I just wanted to buy a notebook and some pens, but New Zealand and the United States don’t use the same size paper and the pens were all sold individually.
Little things can easily throw you off, but I’ve learned that you very quickly adapt to your surroundings — there isn’t really any other choice.
There is a big difference between visiting another country and deciding to not only live there, but also attend a university. Everything you’ve been taught since kindergarten when you were five, is subject to change (see school supplies above).
Another thing that is vastly different is when class literally starts and stops. This has been a challenging adaptation for me since I usually operate on a schedule. On my class schedule — timetable as they call it here — classes start and end at the top of the hour. There isn’t a 10-minute break inbetween the beginning and the end as there is at USC. Consequently, there is a 20-minute window in which a professor can start class, and I’ve experienced both ends of the spectrum. Some professors start ten minutes before the hour, some start on the hour and some start at 10 past.

In reflection on my first few days of class, I’ve started to realize how these little things add up to huge differences in education systems between countries. I expect that this semester, for as much new information as I will learn from books, I will also learn about different ways of life from immersing myself in a new culture.
Everything on campus is written in English as well as in Maori, the language of the native Maori people. This is still a shock of sorts since it is a language so foreign to anything I have been exposed to in the United States, but an immediately telling sign on the importance of the native culture to everyday life in New Zealand.
In my first week I was not only introduced to a wealth of new knowledge from the three New Zealand cultural classes that I am taking, but also a new culture in the classroom. Academic differences wasn’t a huge consideration in my decision to study abroad, but I now know that it is something everyone should be aware of before leaving their home country.
As this journey carries on, I continue to explore new physical, academic and intellectual areas of a completely new culture. The idea that every week will be a new challenge is simultaneously daunting and exhilarating. What better way to get to know a country than to be taught in their education system? I look forward to learning new things about New Zealand both in and out of the classroom for the next 12 weeks of this semester.

Half of me wants to spill all the tea that has been my life these past couple of weeks to you all and the other half of me wants nothing to do with other human beings right now. I’m not even sure what I wanted to talk about because lately I have been feeling so lost in the sauce. As I was brainstorming article ideas that would be inspiring, the lack of the creative juices was very evident. Lately I feel like I have been running on E —physically, emotionally and mentally. 
I feel like everyone goes through waves of wanting to just hit the eject button from life. With spring break three weeks away, my desire to run away from all my responsibilities has been turned on high. Unlike probably so many other people, I have no special, exciting or tropical plans for the break so I will most likely just pop over to Arizona for a couple days to recharge with my family. 
I decided to write a short letter to my future self for this week’s blog. Part of this act of vulnerability for me is that I want to acknowledge some good and some not-so-good (I guess?) parts about myself and my life right now so I can look back at this and see how far I’ve grown. Whether my personal letter is something that resonates with you or not, I highly recommend anyone reading this do this themselves. Being open and honest can be hard, whether it’s with friends or family, but I’ve learned that sometimes the hardest person to get real with is yourself. 
So, here goes nothing…
 
Dear Future Self, 
I know lately you’ve been feeling really lost. But I want you to know it’s okay and that as cliche as it sounds — it won’t last forever. You’re someone that thrives on working toward goals. Lately, some of those goals have seemed very overwhelming. When there are bumps in the road or detours in your grand plan you get really thrown off. It’s okay to not know where to go next. Life isn’t a pre-programmed GPS with just one destination. It’s okay to feel lost sometimes, to feel like you want to throw in the towel, that you’ve failed.
Everything will happen in God’s time. So now matter how much you are wanting to press the gas, if the tank is on E, you have to let God refill the tank. You can’t be at point Z if you haven’t gone through X and Y yet. I know you want so many things and often your impatience, perfectionism and sensitivity to what seems like the whole world makes it feel like those goals are unattainable or that life can’t possibly have something as great as you want really in store for you. But it does and you just have to replace that fear with faith.
Once you stop comparing your journey to other’s or even to where you think you should be or who you think you should be, you can finally be at peace with the path you are on. Let God prepare you for what you want in the future, so that when it presents itself you are ready for it. 
Have patience in the journey. Acknowledge that through struggle and failure and being vulnerable you are only growing. And sometimes growing is painful, but it is also worth it. 
– Me

Brace yourselves, SoCal residents; the apocalypse has arrived. No, it’s the not the heralded 9 point magnitude earthquake you were expecting, it’s something far, far worse: rain. But even as L.A. grinds to a halt, you don’t have to let some water falling from the sky ruin your day — or your cute outfit. Here are some tips and tricks for surviving the inclement weather until the next drought mercifully arrives.
DIY rain gear
Considering it hasn’t rained here for the past decade, it’s quite understandable if there’s a conspicuous lack of raincoats in your wardrobe. But now that the streets are starting to resemble the Rio Grande, some waterproof gear is probably a good idea. Here’s a fun and fashion-forward DIY poncho idea: get a large black trash bag, cut slits for your head and arms, and voila — the leak-proof, odor-proof bag will keep you nice and dry as you make your arduous, five-minute trek to class. Besides, you are what you wear, right?  
Be prepared 
There’s something about rain that makes everyone want to snuggle up in bed with a steaming cup of tea and Netflix queued up, and refuse to step foot outside until the watery onslaught is over. But most are only equipped to hole up for a day or two at most — certainly not an entire week. Make like a Boy Scout and ensure you’re prepared, with crackers, peanut butter, protein bars, canned vegetables, fruit preserves, non-perishable pasteurized milk, freeze-dried ice cream, duct tape, a flashlight, a battery-powered radio, a fire extinguisher, adhesive bandages, antibiotic ointment, sterile dressings to stop bleeding and at least three Costco-sized water bottle packs. Under these hazardous conditions, there’s no way you can just pop into Ralph’s to satisfy your cookie cravings. 
Shampoo your hair
Let’s be real: even if you carry an umbrella/wear a hat, the dampness of the air and the thick knit beanie are going to cause some serious hair frizz. Instead, why not embrace the showers and have them stand in for your actual shower? Before stepping outside, lather up your hair with your regular shampoo and let the torrential downpour do the rest of the work–the acidity of the LA rain will work wonders for silky smooth strands. If you really want to go the whole nine yards, then don’t forget to wear your towel — and nothing else.
