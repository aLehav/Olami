West 27th Place Apartments on Figueroa Street and 27th Street plans to add five retailers on the Figueroa side of the ground floor.
The first to open will be Five Guys Burgers and Fries, a Virginia-based burger restaurant.
Bagel · Five Guys and Brooklyn Water Bagel Co. will move into the ground floor of West 27th Place. Three more retail locations in the building have not yet been rented. - Carlo Acenas | Daily Trojan
Tabitha Stevens, property manager of West 27th Place Apartments, said Five Guys should open by the end of the semester and Brooklyn Water Bagel Co. should open in fall 2012.
Many students who live in the building said they are excited about the new options.
Greg Gunter, a sophomore majoring in history, said he was excited Five Guys was coming to the area.
“Five Guys is easily in my top 10 favorite restaurants,” Gunter said. “The burgers are pretty decent and the fries are amazing. It also happens to be pretty affordable.”
Brooklyn Water Bagel Co., a small Brooklyn-based bagel company that uses water from Brooklyn, N.Y. as a key ingredient, will also join the complex. Brooklyn Water Bagel Co. will offer a variety of New York-style bagels, coffee and a convenient study environment.
Katie Roughan, a sophomore majoring in psychology, said having a place to get coffee nearby will be convenient.
“It’d be nice for students who have early classes to be able to walk downstairs and get a coffee,” Roughan said. “Coffee and bagel before class? I have nothing against that.”
With three spots still open, many students hope healthier food options will occupy the spaces.
Max McTee, a junior majoring in business administration, said he agreed healthier options would be a good addition.
“I love Five Guys but students want healthy options nowadays,” McTee said.
Stevens said the companies that will occupy the other three vacant retail spots  are ultimately up to the building owner.
“Our office does not really have a say in it,” Stevens said. “Students have been asked their opinion but the building owners want to make sure that whoever comes in can pay the rent.”
Stevens said Whole Foods Market considered occupying a space, but the space was too small to accommodate a supermarket.
“There was talk of including a Whole Foods but the spacing is more suited to smaller restaurants,” Stevens said.
Hours of operation for Five Guys and Brooklyn Water Bagel Co. have not yet been determined.

USC students, alumni and faculty will soon compete to develop innovative methods of communication for a top prize of $50,000.
Young President’s Organization, a global network of young entrepreneurs and U.S. Trust, an investment management company based in New York, are sponsoring the Y-Prize Business Plan Challenge at USC.
Contestants are required to submit an idea by Oct. 10. Students, alumni and faculty from the Marshall School of Business, Annenberg School of Communication & Journalism, Viterbi School of Engineering and School of Cinematic Arts are eligible. YPO said it chose these schools because they were best suited for the competition.
The competition is intended for students who have a business plan but lack the means to finance it.
“It’s for the early stages,” Miller said. “You may have your own business plan but you haven’t gone to professional investors yet. If you have raised outside money, you’re probably too far and don’t qualify for the competition.”
Gene Miller, director of the Grief Center for Entrepreneurial Studies, said the competition is one of the largest competitions at Marshall.
The awarded team can decide how to divide and use the money, according to the Y-Prize website.
Twenty semifinalists will be chosen Nov. 1 and will receive a YPO mentor who will help develop their plan into a feasible business opportunity. The teams will be narrowed down to three Dec. 1 for the finals.
Finalists will give a 15-minute presentation to the judges and answer questions for five minutes.
The panel of judges will be members of YPO, U.S. Trust or people who have experience in entrepreneurship. The winner will be chosen using the Return on Investment Approach, which compares the money needed to endorse the plan with how it will advance new media.
“The idea is to stimulate new businesses,” Miller said. “To stimulate entrepreneurial thinking. That’s the motivation.”
The final presentation and award ceremony will be Jan. 26, 2012 at Town & Gown.

The Dept. of Public Safety and the Los Angeles Police Department responded to a call about a body found on the University Park Campus early Wednesday morning, and have confirmed the incident is being investigated as a suspected suicide.
Dept. of Public Safety · The Los Angeles Police Department and DPS responded to a call about a body found near Parking Structure D at 7:15 a.m. Wednesday. - Kristy Pyke | Daily Trojan
The body found on the Figueroa Street side of Parking Structure D was identified as Michael McCann, the 28-year-old son of a USC faculty member, according to LAPD Sgt. John Bertino. McCann did not attend USC.
The Los Angeles County coroner’s office confirmed the identity of the body. The faculty member, a professor of philosophy and English, is a residential faculty adviser for North Residential College.
Tim Gustafson, associate professor of English and American studies and ethnicity and a residential faculty adviser for New Residential College, remembered McCann as an amicable and genuine person and said his children grew up playing with him.
“He was a beautiful kid,” Gustafson said. “He was a neighbor and a part of my extended family. My kids grew up with him.”
The victim was reported as having jumped or fallen off of the parking structure. The call came into LAPD at 7:15 a.m. Wednesday and eight LAPD officers responded by 7:19 a.m. DPS is assisting in the investigation.
Parking Structure D was temporarily closed as LAPD conducted its investigation and was reopened to the public at 10:41 a.m.
Mike was such an awesome guy.  He will be missed by his family and friends.
This is such a tragedy for the university.The McCanns are the most generous, open and welcoming family Their contributions to USC are immeasurable. I pray for Ed and Linda and hope that they know the entire Trojan family supports them during this difficult time.
I pray that Professor McCann and his family have the strength to bear this huge loss. May God bless his son, Mike.
I never really knew Mike, but I lived in New/North freshman year and have wonderful memories of speaking with Prof. McCann and his wife.  My thoughts and prayers are with them.
Yeah, Tim you are totally right.  Mike was an awesome guy and he was loved by many…
Thank you Tim, for the lovely remembrance of Mike. He truly was a wonderful man. We miss him and our thought are with the McCanns.

As the three-time defending NCAA champions, the No. 4 USC men’s water polo team has plenty of reasons to remain optimistic. Despite losing their first two games of the season last weekend, the Trojans, with a bevy of youth and experience, are still in prime position to make a run at a fourth consecutive title.
Dyanmic · Senior goalie Joel Dennerley broke USC’s all-time record for career saves against UCLA earlier this year. He has also notched a Conference Player of the Year award and three NCAA titles in his career so far at USC. - Kevin Nguyen | Daily Trojan
Perhaps no one, though, has been more pivotal to the Trojans’ most recent run of success than senior goalie Joel Dennerley, last year’s Mountain Pacific Sports Federation Player of the Year, who recently became USC’s all-time career saves leader.
“It’s something special for sure,” Dennerley said of breaking the record. “It’s a great honor.”
Forecasting a bright future for Dennerley, a native of Chester Hill, Australia, has been easy — at least to some degree.
Arriving on campus as a wide-eyed freshman in the summer of 2008, Dennerley has served as the Trojans’ starting goalie throughout his entire tenure with the program. And every season the three-time All-American has been in between the pipes for USC, the team has captured an NCAA title.
In spite of the multitude of hardware, the 6-foot-4 Dennerley insists his college experience expands beyond the pool.
“It’s been great,” Dennerley said. “I’m unbelievably lucky to get this sort of opportunity — coming to a great school and a great water polo program as well. It’s been unforgettable.”
Dennerley, perhaps most notably this season, set the USC career-record for saves, which was 674, during the finals of the NorCal tournament against rival UCLA on Sept. 18 — a game in which the Trojans won 10-8. Notching his 675th save, Dennerley immortalized himself among greats who have played for the Trojans, something that isn’t lost on the native Australian.
“USC has such a great tradition of water polo,” Dennerley said. “Many great players have come through here, and to be among those goalies that have played here in the past and have basically set up the tradition that we have here at USC is a privilege as well.”
Though he has made his mark playing for USC, Dennerley also played on Australia’s national team before coming to the United States to play on the collegiate circuit.
“I still play for Australia, but I was playing for the junior national team and we had the Junior World Championships in Long Beach … so from there [USC coach Jovan Vacic] scouted me and recruited me from there,” Dennerley said. “Then, basically a year later, I was back over.”
Though he is certainly pleased to be a record holder, he is not losing sight of this season and the team as a whole. He has made sure the Trojans keep their eyes on the ultimate prize: another title.
“[We feel] good, you know. We sort of set up goals for ourselves and take each week as a new week,” Dennerley said after a recent 14-4 home victory over Princeton. “We try not to get too far ahead of ourselves, but I think we’re on track.”
At this point in his career, Dennerley does not have a lot left to prove. But for now, he remains content with simply being a good teammate, helping to lead the Trojans to what would be an unprecedented fourth-straight national championship.
“It’s funny,” Dennerley said. “The last season [at USC], you never thought it would come. But here it is, and I think the main thing is still trying to teach the younger players as much as I can, pass on as much information as I can to the new players.”
Having fun, however, doesn’t mean that he and the rest of the team are content with only three titles in three years.
“I think the guys are very hungry,” Dennerley said. “They wanna get back to that national championship. It’s a good vibe amongst the team for sure.”

Despite the announcement he would be redshirted for the 2011 season, freshman George Farmer’s transition to tailback has gone well in practice, earning him praise from USC coach Lane Kiffin.
Dual threat · Freshman wide receiver George Farmer has given the USC offense another option at tailback after improving during practice. - Chris Pham | Daily Trojan
“I was surprised, having not played running back for a while, for him to go back there and look pretty natural at doing it,” Kiffin said. “It says a lot about the athlete that he is. If we could ever get that where he was really a real running back with that size and that speed — and we know what he can do outside — there aren’t many people like that ever.”
Farmer, who was the No. 1 wide receiver recruit out of high school, hurt his ankle in Tuesday’s practice, but came back Wednesday unhindered.
“It really says a lot about him to sprain his ankle yesterday and come back out today,” Kiffin said. “I wish all of our guys did that.”
Though Farmer struggled early on during fall camp and throughout early practices, Kiffin called true freshman struggles a normal problem.
“You probably only get five to seven unique, true freshman stories around the country where guys come in and make major, major impacts, like [sophomore wideout] Robert [Woods] did last year,” Kiffin added. “Once they get some time in the system, they get comfortable, the pressure’s off of them, you see what [they] did in high school.”
—
On a rainy Wednesday morning, Kiffin looked at the weather as a positive aspect for his team during its final bye week practice.
“The weather was good for us to have,” he said. “We haven’t really dealt with bad weather much. It was good, especially for our skill guys, to work in this [weather]. Obviously, [there is] a possibility of that coming up with a couple road games on our schedule.”
Starting Thursday, USC will prepare for its Oct. 13 game against California in San Francisco.
—
Starting with Cal, USC will face a slew of 3-4 and multiple defensive packages, which could cause problems for USC’s offensive line.
“If the team’s only 3-4, it’s a little bit easier because that’s all you prepare for the week,” Kiffin said. “But these guys are so multiple. Sometimes there’s two downsmen, three downsmen, four down linemen, so it makes it really difficult on young linemen especially.”
—
Senior fullback Ross Cumming’s play Saturday was solid and surprising although it was his first game at fullback.
“I wish we had done [the position change] earlier,” Kiffin said. “It’s just an example of a guy staying around here, understanding the systems, understanding the techniques. What we teach on special teams can really carry over to offense and defense regardless of positions, and Ross is a great example to step right in and contribute.”
—
Junior quarterback Matt Barkley returned to full practice after freshman quarterback Max Wittek took extended snaps Tuesday.
Sophomore Robert Woods was a full participant in the rain, although Kiffin originally thought Woods would sit out for a couple days to recover from an injured ankle and elbow.
Kiffin reported there were no major injuries sustained during Wednesday’s practice.

For the first time since mid-October of last year, the No. 4 USC men’s water polo team will look to dive back into Mountain Pacific Sports Federation hoping to rebound from a loss.
Offensive lift · After USC scored just 10 goals in its last two games, junior driver Michael Rosenthal hopes to give the Trojans a boost. - Ralf Cheung | Daily Trojan
Last week the previously undefeated Trojans (9-2, 1-0) suffered back-to-back losses at the hands of No. 1 Stanford and No. 3 UCLA by a combined three goals in the semifinals and third-place game of the SoCal tournament, respectively.
Yet, with a snapped 22-game winning streak, the Trojans remain optimistic they can get back on track, as they host No. 14 Long Beach State on Thursday at 5 p.m. at McDonald’s Swim Stadium.
“We need to bounce back from these losses,” senior goalie Joel Dennerley said. “Hopefully we address the areas where we didn’t execute and put in a much better performance.”
USC’s MPSF duel with the 49ers is followed by an exhibition match later that evening against Long Beach City College, and another conference battle against No. 12 Loyola Marymount on Saturday at 1 p.m.
“[Long Beach State] is usually always a tough game, so we have to be ready for that one,” sophomore driver Nikola Vavic said. “They’re all tough teams but we should be alright as long as we get back to what we know we can do. This weekend was a real eye opener. We realized that things aren’t going to be as easy as we thought.”
Following a pair of losses over the weekend, the Trojans’ ranking slipped from the top and gave way to Stanford, who ended up winning the SoCal tournament.
Some of the team’s recent struggles, at least according to Jovan Vavic, can be attributed to injuries, as senior two-meter Matt Burton, who finished with 33 goals last season, has been sidelined in recent weeks.
“The fact one of our best players did not play for the last few weeks really affected us,” Jovan Vavic said. “We could have used [Burton]. When your offense isn’t really clicking, you fall back on your defense and we could have really used him there.”
With a  familiar setting playing host to a pair of conference games, the Trojans insist they can bounce back, having learned lessons from last weekend.
“Every team is dangerous,” Dennerley said. “Every team can beat anyone and nobody is safe. We need to play more consistently and we need to prepare for every team. We have set ourselves on a tough road.”
Complacency has not historically been a problem for the Trojans. As evidenced by the team’s previously-held 22-game winning streak, USC is not accustomed to losing.
But it can settle in.
“We were definitely starting to get a little complacent, a little de-motivated, so I think now we realize it’s not going to be a walk in the park this year as some people might have thought,” Jovan Vavic said. “We should be a different team this week.”
Looking forward, Dennerley’s experience in the net — the senior already has 87 saves on the season — and the efforts of young players such as Nikola Vavic and freshman driver Kosta Genidounias will play a pivotal role this weekend for the Trojans.
“We need to come out with more intensity,” Nikola Vavic said. “We were pretty low and pretty down last weekend and we need some more fire this week, but I think we’ll definitely see improvement there.”

In my 10 years or so of playing Madden and NCAA Football video games, I had never blocked a kick or even seen one blocked. Sunday evening, that changed, when I denied a 31-yard field-goal try.
So shocked and excited was I by this event, it occurred to me just how much I had taken special teams for granted up until that point. And it reminded me: It seems like most people, except for those really keyed in, are taking USC’s special teams for granted.
All the talk centers on junior quarterback Matt Barkley and sophomore receiver Robert Woods’ astonishing chemistry, the general absence of a running game and remaining questions on whether the defense really is any good. No one’s talking about special teams coach John Baxter and his unheralded guys.
Baxter came to USC from Fresno State prior to the 2010 season to bolster coach Lane Kiffin’s special teams unit — and bolster it he did. Under Pete Carroll, the Trojans’ special teams were unimpressive, a characteristic unknown to most with an elite offense and defense to cover it up.
Now it’s the staple of the team, the consistent unit that persists even when the offense or defense does not. And a lot of it is because of Baxter’s attitude and schemes.
Baxter is very serious about his commitment to special teams. He’s a strong believer in the maxim that USC should be the hammer, not the nail. That’s why Baxter awards an actual hammer every week — as voted by the players — to the greatest special teams contributor in the previous game. That player gets to keep the hammer for the week and carry it out of the tunnel for the next game.
It’s cheesy, but it makes sense that it works. When you can’t play for money, you have to play for pride and teamwork. These incentives, however symbolic, can mean a lot to the players and foster a positive sense of competition among the unit to excel on the field.
Special teams, more than any other unit, is fueled by effort. And Baxter seems to have found an effective way to motivate his players to work their hardest. Eighty-four blocked kicks and punts and 39 special teams touchdowns at Fresno State speak for themselves.
But it’s not all about motivation. Some of it is about the technical aspect. I’m not going to pretend I know the intricacies of how his systems manage to routinely shut down kick returners before a big gain, but they do. I’m not going to pretend I know how his plays tend to end in blocked kicks, but they do.
In Pete Carroll’s last season, the “Block that kick!” chant was a mere formality; it wasn’t going to happen all that often. Through the last two seasons, with Baxter running the show, there’s some hope that on every field goal attempt or punt, someone’s hand is going to get in the way before the ball goes sailing.
Of course, at times these kicks will go unobstructed. But the threat of a blocked kick is almost just as helpful as the block itself. Punting or kicking requires a high level of concentration and confidence that you’ll get the kick off before a defensive player can get in the way. Baxter has these punters and kickers looking over their shoulders to the point that they get distracted and are unable to perform.
That’s why teams are missing extra points and field goals against the Trojans.
When junior left tackle Matt Kalil blocked Utah’s field goal attempt to seal the win at the end of the week two game, it got everyone’s attention. And Kalil got to carry that hammer for a week.
But the problem is these plays don’t always get the attention they deserve. When Arizona kicker Alex Zendejas had an extra point blocked last week, there was no ceremony. When he missed a point last week, it was assumed he made a mistake, but I suspect the USC special teams had something to do with it.
The problem is that special teams, much like offensive linemen, is better off not being in the spotlight. When an offensive lineman gets attention, he usually did something wrong. Same goes for a kicker or a punter. Just ask New York Giants’ punter Matt Dodge.
Special teams players are expected to do what they’re supposed to do without receiving any credit.
Baxter and his players are probably fine with that. But it’s important not to underestimate their effect on USC’s play this season because they’ve been spectacular.

Long after players, coaches and equipment managers exited the USC locker room last Saturday after the Trojans’ narrow 48-41 victory over Arizona, two jovial voices could still be heard chatting it up in the far left corner of the room.
Fab freshman · Freshman wide receiver Marqise Lee has impressed the coaching staff with his play this season. He is second on the team with 21 receptions, 323 receiving yards and three touchdowns and helped ease the burden off sophomore wideout Robert Woods. - Kelvin Kuo | Daily Trojan
Huddled closely around their adjacent lockers were two teammates, two friends, two students of the game, reminiscing about the roads which brought them from Junipero Serra High School in nearby Gardena, Calif., to their newfound lives of highlight-filled Saturdays and sudden nationwide recognition.
The elder, sophomore wide receiver Robert Woods, had just recorded a career-high 255 receiving yards (five short of the school record) and a career-long 82-yard touchdown reception, while the younger, freshman wideout Marqise Lee, had a coming out party of his own with a career-high eight receptions, 144 yards receiving and a beautiful 38-yard touchdown catch.
Regardless of where their individual journeys might take them, the two have come to terms with the fact that they will forever be linked to one another. But if Lee’s “I belong” moment against the Wildcats serves as any indication, he might already be walking down a solo path that he and Woods can both appreciate.
“It’s been hard creating my own path,” Lee said. “When I made the change from defense to offense, the first challenge was making a name for myself amongst all of these great receivers. Then when I came out in the fall and moved up on the depth chart, naturally people brought my name up with Robert. It’s an honor, but we really are two different players. And I think people are starting to see that.”
Though Woods has joked on many occasions Lee is the stronger, faster and more athletic receiver of the two, the freshman’s last three performances (14 catches, 257 yards and three touchdowns for 24, 38 and 43 yards a piece) are no laughing matter. Overshadowed at times by his longtime teammate, his progress through five weeks is not lost on anyone.
“Just look for him to get better and to continue putting up numbers for our offense,” Woods said. “I know that he is his own person and his own player. It’s exciting to see him grow and I’m just proud of him.”
Though Lee’s game champions humility instead of flashiness, the former national champion track star (his long jump of 24-8 was top in the country in 2011) is not afraid to step up in the big moment. Whether it was his acrobatic touchdown grab to pull the Trojans close in the third quarter in their loss against Arizona State or the leaping catch he made on a 45-yard jump ball pass to open the fourth quarter against Arizona, Lee admits he thrives when the lights shine the brightest.
“My ability to go make a play for the offense is my best asset,” Lee said. “If we need a big catch down the field or a short first down or just a big block, I just want to be a part of it. It’s about knowing your role at all times and executing.”
Lee is by no means riding on the coattails of his recent success, however, because in his eyes, he hasn’t lived up to the expectations he set for himself.
“I might have a great game here and there, but that’s not the time to be content,” Lee said. “I am a young guy trying to go out and execute when my name is called, whether that’s in practice or in a game. The test should always be, can I do better than I did the week before. Maybe that comes with maturity, but that’s where my focus is right now.”
If his scholarly approach to practice, big play capabilities during crunch time aren’t enough to sell you that he’s the next big thing at USC, look no further than his coaching staff, who on a daily basis is not shy on showering praise on the Inglewood, Calif., native.
“I know it’s early to say, but I think he is going to be one of the best receivers ever to play at this school,” USC coach Lane Kiffin said after last Thursday’s practice.
Others have expressed similar sentiments.
“He is a pleasure to coach because what you see on game day is what we see during the week at practice,” wide receivers coach Ted Gilmore said. “He a delightful young man who is mature beyond his years. Not to mention, he is as good a student of the game as he is a player.”
Through the first five games of Lee’s collegiate career, his output is on par with the likes of Woods, as well as other former Trojan All-Americans such as Keyshawn Johnson, Mike Williams and Lynn Swann. And though it might be a tad early to crown him the next face of the USC football program, it’s hard not to like a guy whose ear-to-ear grin is never far behind.
“I just love to play the game,” Lee said. “I want fans to see a guy who just plays with passion, plays hard and does what it takes to help the team be as successful as it can be. For me, that’s enough.”
Awesome story Denise. Love to hear positive things about the charector of our players!
My husband and I were walking back to our daughters new dorm room after the last task at the credit union was completed on 2011 move in day. Marquise Lee was walking on campus and he and my husband struck up a conversation. The unassuming young man was gracious and polite.  As we parted ways my husband asked him what his name was and with a smile told us.  We said we would look for him.  Little did we know we met the new promising receiver!  Fight on, Marquise!

It’s been four months since Oprah Winfrey arrived at Harpo Studios in Chicago to host her final episode of The Oprah Show. Fans and even some critics thought daytime television would never be the same when the queen of daytime left to work on her next big project, The Oprah Winfrey Network.
With Oprah out of many people’s schedules at 3 p.m., whom can you watch on a daily basis to get your dose of news, inspiration or entertainment? Katie Couric’s show doesn’t debut until 2013. Holly Robinson Peete and Leah Remini weren’t asked back to The Talk.
Viewers need not worry; there are, in fact, plenty of shows out there to choose from. Here is a look at some programs that might fill Oprah’s spot and keep you enthralled in between classes and work.
The Ellen DeGeneres Show, NBC
Ellen might just be the new queen of daytime. The host can make you laugh, feel compassionate and of course, dance. Every A-list celebrity stops by her set when promoting his or her new movie, television show or album.
She might not ask hard, nosy questions, but with her endearing charm you can’t possibly get mad at her for it. Plus, her fun and popular segments, such as “Bad Paid For Photos” and “Know Or Go,” never get stale.
Besides, who can resist watching the audience freak-their-freak when receiving the best giveaways in daytime TV? Washers, dryers, trips and $500 gift cards — if only obtaining tickets wasn’t impossible.
Anderson, FOX
New this fall to the daytime spectrum, Anderson Cooper steps up to try his hand at hosting two programs. Compared to his nightly CNN show, Cooper’s daytime gig allows for a different portrayal of the hard-hitting journalist.
In his debut week, he went spray tanning with Jersey Shore star Snooki, proclaimed his love for The Real Housewives when some of the Beverly Hills housewives showed up and even went on vacation with Kathy Griffin.
Don’t expect every episode to be all fun and games, though. Cooper has already devoted episodes to more serious issues such as foster parents, conjoined twins and former Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints members, providing a well-rounded and intriguing lineup.
The Today Show with Kathie Lee And Hoda, NBC
At 10 a.m., the fourth hour of The Today Show might be too early for some college students.
Regardless, wine-lovers Kathie Lee Gifford and Hoda Kotb transform the news program into happy hour with hilarious banter, memorable segments and energetic guests sometimes willing to have a sip or two of alcohol.
Previous programs have featured ambush makeovers, an interview with Morgan Freeman and Taylor Lautner and foods to put you in a better mood. It’s informative and entertaining, just as morning news should be.
The Dr. Oz Show, ABC
Dr. Oz, one of the few lucky people to be considered one of Oprah’s best friends, is taking over the former host’s time slot in Los Angeles.
The famous doctor has been in the headlines recently for his investigation of apple juice safety after his show found amounts of arsenic in some brands of the favorite children’s drink, demonstrating Dr. Oz is more than just a television personality and truly invests himself with the subject matter at hand.
When not scaring parents, Dr. Oz spends his hour-long program discussing everything from weight and food choices to anti-aging and fitness.
Wendy Williams Show, FOX
“How you doin?” are the famous words repeated on Wendy Williams’ talk show day after day.

Proudly wearing one of her many wigs, the host begins every show with the day’s hot topics. Whether she’s telling viewers her thoughts on Brad Pitt’s comments about Jennifer Aniston or her reaction to some of The Real Housewives of New York City cast members being fired, she doesn’t hold back.
Williams is willing to dish it out, even if that means A-listers are less likely to visit her show.
The Chew, ABC
Food lovers, rejoice! ABC has developed a new daytime program celebrating life through food to replace All My Children.
Hosts Carla Hall (Top Chef), Clinton Kelly (What Not To Wear), Daphne Oz (daughter of Dr. Oz), Mario Batali and Michael Symon (Iron Chef America) unite to talk everything gourmet and entertaining.
From cooking to interior design to holiday traditions, the hosts will share their tips and expertise on a daily basis live from New York City. If you can’t watch, make sure to check out the website at TheChew.com for the day’s top recipe featured on the show.
To be honest, no TV host will ever replace Oprah. I know other TV hosts will be entertaining but they will not change people’s lives like Oprah did. It is estimated that she has changed millions of lives and personally, if it weren’t for Oprah, I wouldn’t be here at USC. Yes, you will know who I am because I have been known on campus as the only USC student who watches Oprah.

Pepper has been a force in lesser-known music circuits for more than a decade. Its sound features a blend of punk, reggae dub, metal, Hawaiian spirit and plenty of good times. And the tireless band from Kailua-Kona, Hawaii, has toured constantly since it first left the backyards and house parties of its hometown at the start of the 2000s.
Raucous trio · Pepper, notorious for its rambunctious and risqué antics, is making a tour stop in Los Angeles to advertise its new EP Stitches and to appease fans with the band’s relentless energy and talent. - Photo courtesy of Reybee Productions
Supported by a remarkably networked, passionate fan base, Pepper has released a number of LPs, including Kona Town and No Shame. The band is now touring in support of the five-song EP Stitches.
“The EP is something we’ve never done, so we can check it off our list,” drummer Yesod Williams said. “A handful of songs felt really strong and we always want to put our best foot forward. We also just wanted to get some new blood in the lineup.”
The atmosphere at a Pepper show, livened with ubiquitous drinks in plastic cups and the floating, hazy swells of pot tokes, lifts you in a tsunami wave of energy. Shirtless, tattooed, devil-may-care party animals Bret Bollinger, Kaleo Wassman and Williams have gained a reputation for being one of the most exhaustively enthusiastic bands you can see live.
“The philosophy of Pepper has always been, and always will be, about spreading the message of fun,” Williams said.
But while the band’s rager-in-full-effect live shows continue to be a major priority, the liquid, herbal and chemical boosts that elevated its antics have proven to be less necessary. What used to be a constant state of inebriation and recklessness has finally (somewhat) mellowed.
“We’re certainly not getting any younger,” Williams said. “The bounce-back time is not so quick anymore.”
The lifestyle would be nothing without the music to back it up. The band’s songwriting process normally takes on a part-to-whole structure, where singers Bollinger and Wassman will come in with lyrics or melodies and the band will work them out together until they’re finished.
“We’d sit down and I’d try to see if it all made sense, we’d see if the songs were telling stories, if it was really finished,” Williams said. “In that sense it was more collaborative this time than before.”
The current “Last Calls & Liabilities” tour, stopping at Club Nokia in downtown Los Angeles on Oct. 9, will show Pepper at perhaps its most interesting stage given that each record to date has been an exploration of the different threads of possibility in the band’s sound.
Stitches seems to be the ultimate amalgamation of the cherished hybrids the band has created. Though Pepper will surely dig deep into its expansive catalog — it seems perpetually game to play the crowd favorite “Give It Up (Dirty Hot Sex)” — the trio will be sure to showcase the newfound diversity of the latest EP.
A lot of people only focus on the breasts and booze aspect of Pepper’s music. What’s less obvious are the unique textures to the songs, the breezy sensitivity and the lyrical desperation in even some of the edgier tunes. Few bands are capable of this.
And despite the band’s constant travels in the continental United States, it doesn’t seem like Pepper has any plans of slowing down.
“Being away from home, Hawaii, is never easy, but we do take full advantage of ‘normal life’ anytime we are there,” Williams said. “We’re able to recharge the batteries.”
Being Warped Tour regulars and touring with other bands, vaguely similar to the band’s genre (Slightly Stoopid, 311, Passafire, Ballyhoo!), the Kona Town homeboys have become fixtures in areas like Boulder and throughout Southern California, where the band’s sound perhaps has the most resonance with beach and snow cultures.
Pepper’s cult following constantly aches for new music and for more appearances. And it’s this hunger that makes it likely the members will probably keep playing until the ocean dries up and all the tattooed girls in the world start listening to only top 40.

CicLAvia
If you thought Carmageddon — that time the 405 closed, leaving absolutely no cars on the road — was a blast, just imagine the fun in store with the surface streets intentionally shut down.
Started as a health initiative in Bogotá, Colombia in an attempt to fight against the city’s persistent pollution, CicLAvia has now extended throughout Latin America and the United States, providing citizens with a brief moment of serenity in their bustling cities, even if only for a moment.
On Sunday, an unbelievable 10 miles of Los Angeles streets will be closed, including added stops at South Los Angeles and Olvera Street. Bikers will be abundant. Shops will open their doors. And, of course, there will be delectable food.
It’s not often Downtown Los Angeles transforms into a pedestrian friendly, park-like setting. This Sunday marks the third CicLAvia event, so make the most of it and enjoy the brief moment of openness in our typically crazed concrete jungle.

Let’s hit up a gallery this weekend. This probably isn’t the first thing your friends say when you’re planning your epic weekend. The usual image of a gallery is a cold, unwelcoming place only wealthy art lovers dare visit.
In reality, it’s easy to saunter into a gallery and enjoy yourself. Los Angeles and its surrounding cities have broken through the snobby stereotypes with a few kooky, unpretentious, bold galleries.
Memorable art · Galleries like “Hold Up Art” feature myriad quirky art exhibitions and pieces, such as this graffiti painting by artist Nick Dattomo, located on the outside wall of the “Hold Up Art” exhibition. - Eva Recinos | Daily Trojan
A few spots in particular can make the experience a memorable one.
The Hive Gallery & Studios
With so many different featured artists and an expansive space, this locale really does feel a lot like a beehive, but in the best possible way.
Hive Gallery displays Neo-Pop Art, a modern adaptation of Pop Art, which usually means really humorous, fun art. The gallery makes sure to display some affordable pieces and all the items in the store are less than $50.
On any given Art Walk night, you can buy an alcoholic drink and stumble upon everything from impromptu talent shows to giant, horror movie-esque stuffed animals. It’s a little like falling down Alice in Wonderland’s rabbit hole, minus the danger of getting your head chopped off by a crazy queen.
Just make sure to visit Wednesday through Saturday between 1 p.m. and 6 p.m., as all other days are by appointment only.
The Hive Gallery & Studios is located on 729 South Spring St. For more information, visit hivegallery.com.
Royal/T Cafe
The opening party at Royal/T Cafe for the current exhibition “East Village West” was a little like a sweet sixteen: There were DJs, pyramids of colorful free donuts and makeup artists.
These days, you can peruse some intriguing art and eat in the cafe, which meshes Japanese, Californian and French flavors and dishes up everything from grilled salmon to macaroon rings (which are exactly what they sound like). And oh, I almost forgot: the servers are waitresses in maid costumes.
In terms of the actual art, Royal/T primarily focuses on contemporary Japanese works, but has a penchant for anything playful and eclectic; its store includes everything from Hello Kitty Lomography cameras to bookends in the form of mini-Jeff Koon steel balloon dogs.
Royal/T is also conveniently close to Culver City’s Art District, a cluster of art galleries near Washington and La Cienega boulevards. Check Royal/T’s Facebook page for opening parties and occasional free yoga lessons.
Royal/T Cafe is located on 8910 Washington Blvd. For more information, visit www.royal-t.org.
Hold Up Art
Little Tokyo is almost always filled with people heading to sushi restaurants, karaoke bars and American Apparel.
But you’re missing out if you don’t stop by Hold Up Art. This intimate gallery literally always has its doors open during regular business hours, and practically invites you to walk in and discover some fascinating art. It feels like the kind of place where you could unknowingly sit next to the exhibiting artist, casually sipping on a Pabst Blue Ribbon.
Hold Up Art has showcased works stemming from a variety of inspirations, from Star Wars to Los Angeles, all created by California-based artists. Check its website to see past and current featured artists.
Hold Up Art is located on 358 East 2nd St. For more information, visit www.holdupart.com.
Crewest
With the growing interest in street art, it’s no surprise there’s a gallery dedicated almost entirely to this blossoming phenomenon. Crewest strives to put the spotlight on art “too edgy and non-conventional for other elitist venues,” so you’re bound to find something intriguing (or at least different).
The venue is part of the Gallery Row in Downtown Los Angeles, which also includes Hold Up Art and Hive Gallery, as well as other galleries of various flavors. Crewest displays art in a variety of media, but gives special attention to graffiti art and street art, including work from artists such as Chaz Bojorquez, a pioneering graffiti writer.
And if you’re inspired by the works or want a souvenir, check out its store or website for T-shirts, books and even an assortment of caps — special spray paint can tops that can help you create your own masterpiece.
Crewest is located on 110 Winston St. For more information, visit www.crewest.com.

New Found Glory rarely ever changes things up. It has a simple formula of crafting songs that melds together the sugary sensation of pop tracks with the fast-paced, hardcore elements of punk songs.
Kings of rock · New Found Glory’s newest album Radiosurgery serves as the quinessential pop-punk record, leaving listeners amped up with good vibes and reciting simple yet catchy lyrics. - Photo courtesy of Miriam Santos
When looking at its discography, one doesn’t see evolution, but consistency. There is, however, one glaring inconsistency in its catalogue: 2006’s Coming Home. It was a record in which the band left its usual formula behind and crafted something truly ingenious and unexpected: a somber, honest, polished, pop-alternative record.
Many fans were taken aback, but the record, which now often gets overlooked in the band’s discography, is truly its best and 2009’s Not Without a Fight could not compete with it.
Essentially, New Found Glory decided to leave behind this evolution and return to its roots, which was disappointing considering the critical success it had in stepping out of its comfort zone on Coming Home. This regression on Not Without a Fight weighed down the record, and it proved to be nowhere near as memorable as its predecessor or any of New Found Glory’s earlier records.
Now, the band returns with Radiosurgery, a record that is neither a step forward nor backward. It is just a sideways step in the direction the band has always seemed to take (excluding Coming Home).
At first, it sounds like the record will be a condemnation of popular music as it exists today, a sentiment echoed in the artwork’s declaration that “Pop Punk’s not dead!”
This sentiment persists throughout Radiosurgery, and although the record is not overwhelmingly powerful, it is catchy and fun. It is what New Found Glory has always epitomized. It will not necessarily win over new fans, but it will appeal to fans who have been around since the band’s inception.
The relatively mellow title track features riffs reminiscent of Green Day and The Ramones and smooth, memorable melodies as vocalist Jordan Pundik sings, I can’t get your face out of my head / It makes my brain hurt / I need radiosurgery.
These simple, somewhat corny lyrics illustrate the theme of the entire record. As explained in the album’s liner notes, radiosurgery is a recently developed medical procedure used to “target unwanted memories in the brain” and has been shown to be “beneficial in the treatment of past regrets and lost love.”
This theme runs through every single song on Radiosurgery, as many of them dwell on failed relationships. It sounds depressing, but the upbeat music backdrop provided by Chad Gilbert (guitar/background vocals), Steve Klein (guitar), Ian Gruska (bass) and Cyrus Bolooki (drums) complements Pundik’s trademark nasal vocals to create a catchy, celebratory record in true New Found Glory fashion.
Songs like “Drill it in My Brain” and “I’m Not The One” are absolutely anthemic, and are sure to be live favorites. The sing-a-long choruses and fist-pumping instrumentation easily cement these tracks as surefire classics in the band’s catalogue, and single-handedly make the album worth buying.
Other songs like the bass-driven “Summer Fling, Don’t Mean a Thing” and “Trainwreck,” however, are utterly forgettable and lackluster, sounding more like never released b-sides from past material. The melodies and guitar parts all sound recycled and show unoriginality in the songwriting process. Tracks like these prove the band should consider substituting this filler material with more experimental material — like the songs on Coming Home.
The simple lyrics are quite effective in delineating feelings of frustration and resignation regarding failed relationships. In the pleasingly melodic “Dumped,” Pundik sings, You were, you were the only one to break my heart / If I could just go back to the start / I’d tell myself I don’t need anyone.
Meanwhile, the fun, fast-paced “Memories and Battle Scars” shows the passion of attraction and affection with lines that include I want to kiss you so hard that your lips bleed / And I want to hold you so tight that your ribs break. There is nothing mind-blowing about Pundik’s lyrics, but the words are meant to be simple and relatable because New Found Glory live shows are all about crowd participation and sing-a-longs.
New Found Glory has deservedly become one of the definitive faces of the pop-punk music genre and Radiosurgery, despite its flaws, is a further reinforcement of this. It feels much like a summer record, a release that begs to be blasted out of car stereos with the windows down and a group of friends dancing and screaming the words.
It generates good vibes and leaves listeners smiling. In essence, it does just what a pop-punk record should do. It proves that pop-punk is, in fact, alive and well.
Listeners can see it for themselves when New Found Glory plays at the House of Blues in Hollywood, Calif., on Friday.

On Oct. 4, illustrious screenwriter and playwright Elliot Shoenman visited the USC School of Cinematic Arts to give a presentation to undergraduate and graduate aspiring writers.
His presentation, moderated by USC screenwriting professor Paul Wolff, offered valuable first-hand advice about getting started and ‘making it’ as a writer in the cutthroat film and television industry.
“Write what you know,” declared Shoenman, acknowledging the cliché in the statement, “but then let your imagination take over.”
Shoenman began his career with persistence and dedication, sending speculation scripts to the popular sitcom Maude until he was finally offered a job as a writer for the show.
Producers for the show were impressed by his impeccable comedic timing, which eventually gained him a reputation as one of the most desired writers in television. He went on to serve as the showrunner for The Cosby Show, earning an Emmy for the record-breaking hit sitcom.
Shoenman continued to thrive as a television writer, working for such famed shows as Home Improvement, but he never lose sight of what got him there in the first place: a fundamental love of the craft. He implored the audience of young writers to stick to their guns and never lose sight of their artistic goals and personality, reminding them that an Emmy is “ultimately, just a piece of metal,” but that the feeling of creating a wonderful piece of writing will live with you forever.
He described writers in Los Angeles as “refugees from the real world,” because a writer’s work inevitably transforms into his or her “real world.”
Shoenman concluded his presentation by telling aspiring writers that when he was first starting out, he never had any intention on becoming a television writer; he wanted to write feature films. Life, however, had other plans for him. Shoenman, eager to revert to the craft he loves so much and escape from the film industry for a while, is dabbling in playwriting. His critically-acclaimed play Aftermath just finished a six-week run in Los Angeles and is up for an Ovation Award for Best Writing.

This week, Tuscumbia, Alabama became the latest town to join the fight against a fashion trend long known to offend the eyes — sagging pants. Areas that mandate an ordinance against said crime of fashion, such as Albany, Georgia — which began enforcing the law last November — have recently begun to see an increase in cash flow from the fines.
The law prohibits both men and women from wearing pants that hang more than three inches from the hips, allowing both underwear and unmentionables to become visible. The first offence will cost a violator $25, but jumps to $200 for the second.
A city attorney reported to the Albany Herald that since the ordinance went out, “The Municipal Court advises that 187 citations have been issued and fines collected of $3,916.49.” The Herald estimates there are $1500 dollars in citations expected to come in before the end of the year.
Though sagging pants can’t legally get an offender arrested, other penalties include serving up to 40 hours of community service. Critics call the mandate racist, saying it targets African American pop culture; however, city officials claim the law doesn’t discriminate..
Other cities, including President Jimmy Carter’s hometown of Plains, Georgia have been reported to enact similar laws.  Lynwood, a suburb of Chicago, was the first city to take strides against the criminal fashion faux pas in 2008.

Reforms to NCLB are autocratic
Elena Kadvany’s Oct. 3 letter (“Reforms to No Child Left Behind are positive”) contained a reasonable critique of the failed No Child Left Behind policy. Calling standardized test scores “antiquated” and “very harmful,” however, was too radical, given the continuing success of AP courses and the undeniable value of objective testing in math and science courses.
In the scheme of things, this might be a mere quibble. Hardly anyone would call the current policy a success and most would say it privileges testing too much.
What is curiously missing is any analysis of what change she hopes the Obama administration will pursue by conditioning waivers on the adoption of “new academic standards.”
Kadvany is hardly to be blamed for not analyzing the text of the new waiver policy because there’s no text to analyze.
The Washington Post reported that waivers will be subject to the “final decision” of one unelected man, Secretary of Education Arne Duncan.
The waiver application, contained in a Word document titled “ESEA Flexibility Request,” is hopelessly vague, resulting in a diaspora of contradictory analysis from confused journalists. In the end, without any democratic accountability or objectively defined requirements, any state will be at the mercy of whether or not it can effectively lobby the favor of Czar Duncan.
What is to prevent a second-coming of Obamacare waivers, which were finally eliminated after they inequitably proliferated in Rep. Nancy Pelosi’s (D-CA) district?
We, the people, are left to guess as to Duncan’s intentions. Monty Neill, working for a non-profit campaigning against test proliferation, warns that the waivers will bring more of the testing Kadvany opposes.
The waivers “are demanding more, not less, testing.” They demand states use “test results to judge teachers and principals.” States are required to create or buy new tests to hold students to “college- and career-ready standards,” which “are likely to resemble current tests — but be harder to pass.”
It is naïve to think national standards for education could veer from a test-centric approach. After all, the rule of 64 million students by one man and his elite advisers will always require the reduction of cognitive diversity to abstract statistics.
Now, Neill’s analysis might be off, but there is ultimately no way to tell in advance. Even Charlie Barone of Democrats for Education Reform admits, “the proof will be in who makes it, and who doesn’t.”
Since NCLB is a proven loser, and every state is considering a waiver application, a single unelected man now holds the power to veto the education plans of all 50 states until they are changed to meet his will, however arbitrary. To quote a voice of my generation, “No one man should have all that power.”

The journal Science recently published a study that claims single-sex education is more detrimental than beneficial.
Unfortunately, our world is incredibly segregated by gender. Men and women often feel the need to live up to certain expectations society has instilled in them.
Esther Cheong | Daily Trojan
Thus, single-sex education is not as harmful as Science asserts it to be.  In fact, it has many positive effects. Students who attend same-sex institutions can explore their minds in an environment free from gender stereotypes.
At USC, students obviously attend classes taught by members of the opposite sex and with members of the opposite sex. Students at universities and colleges such as Wellesley and Barnard have a vastly different experience in that respect.
The authors of the study, a group of researchers that includes psychologists, child development specialists and a neuroscientist who specializes in gender, claim sex segregation is not a catalyst for higher academic performance.
According to these researchers, there is no scientific backing to statistics that render higher test scores from single-sex classrooms, so there should be no reason to continue educating girls and boys in separate environments.
In fact, they argue breaking up gender is actually harmful to society, for the separation in itself is the first step to exacerbating gender stereotyping and reinforcing sexism within the work environment.
Advocates of single-sex environments, however, assert gender stereotypes are broken down, rather than reinforced, at such institutions.
Without the pressure of traditional male success in subjects such as math or science, girls are more likely to pursue careers in fields that otherwise would have been discouraged, such as engineering or biochemistry.
Without the stereotype of “girly subjects” looming overhead, boys are also presented with the opportunity to explore subjects such as music, poetry or home economics, classes that might otherwise be deemed “too sissy” to take just because they are considered more feminine subjects.
The absence of stereotypes under the guise of peer pressure will put a stop to gender roles that might consequently be broken in the future.
Students in single-sex classrooms or schools might not have any previous conceptions of what girls and boys are generally expected to do and how they are expected to act, which gives them an advantage as they stride forward without hesitation.
This is key to seeing the number of female CEOs or politicians rise because society still reinforces the idea that men are stronger, smarter and more capable.
Sex-typing, such as unequal pay for the same office position for males and females, only continues the very stereotypes that should, by now, be eradicated.
With that, Wellesley and Barnard seem to have their female students’ best interests in mind.
The conclusion might not be a direct result of keeping genders separate, but it is a success for those four years.
Individuals who attend single-sex institutions have the liberty to pursue their goals without the cultural values otherwise ingrained into the minds of everyone else — the lack of pressure serving as an advantage to stepping ahead without fear.
As a girl — and a likely minority in my future workplace — living in a weakened economy and male-dominated society, the eradication of gender roles is something I want to see in the near future to ensure my chances at proving myself are not lost to years of stereotype reinforcement.
The bigger picture needs to be taken into consideration. Stereotypes must be broken in the real world.

The idea of creating a new identity, or “brand,” to attach to the name of the USC Dana and David Dornsife College of Letters, Arts and Sciences was introduced at the Dornsife Commons discussion last week. The new identity looks to emphasize Dornsife as an interdisciplinary school.
Congyu E | Daily Trojan
Branding Dornsife, however, would be a step in the wrong direction. Dornsife is too broad a college to be “branded” at all.
The college encompasses many students with a variety of interests and majors; finding one label to fit everyone is nearly impossible. Labeling could indirectly cause students with various majors or minors to feel excluded because they are no longer part of the “brand.”
Yes, the name of the college has changed, but that does not mean that we need to change its core identity and values along with it.
Labeling Dornsife as an interdisciplinary school could be polarizing. Some students might be interested in pursuing interdisciplinary topics, but others might want to focus on a specific major.
To get any more specific is to risk alienating some of the applicants, not to mention all the students currently part of Dornsife who applied to the school prior to any branding.
We can’t fit such diversity into one label, and we shouldn’t try to do so. To try and narrow down Dornsife to one brand is to take away from the openness that makes it unique among the colleges at USC.
Moreover, the freedom from a label in schools within a university has worked well for other institutions that  USC hopes to rival. Consider Harvard, for example, which has a focus on Liberal Arts Education.
This school is similar to “Dornsife: Faculty of Arts and Sciences.” Its goal, according to the Harvard website, is to redefine the Liberal Arts Education of the 21st century.
USC parallels this ideology. USC is a mecca for diversity with tolerance of varying interests. If we are to remain a competitive institution, we should, in no way, do so by casting aside certain students in USC Dornsife.
USC Dornsife stands out from the rest of the university because it is not a pre-professional school. The university should want a school that is different and offers a different educational focus than the rest.
By forcing USC Dornsife to conform, the university would be making a mistake. The school has value in its differences and the administration should embrace them.
If USC Dornsife were to change, this image could be in jeopardy. Clearly, the current perception of USC Dornsife works. Students are interested in applying to USC and to USC Dornsife, regardless of any fancy label.
The College of Letters, Arts and Sciences hasn’t needed a special brand in the past, so why adopt one now?
USC Dornsife should be proud of its heritage as a College of Letters, Arts and Sciences, instead of trying to reinvent itself under a new brand. One hundred and thirty-one years of history have gone into the college, and building on that tradition would be a more rewarding course of action than changing course completely.

Last Friday, I stepped out from behind my screen long enough to enjoy an ancient form of entertainment: a play.
Fittingly, the play was called Dead Man’s Cell Phone.
Jovanna Tosello | Daily Trojan
The theatre department’s production tells the story of a woman who encounters a dead man at a cafe. Unable to forget the event, she takes his cell phone, answers the calls and weaves her way into his surreal life.
The play is wonderfully complex, and I won’t pretend to know how to distill its message in a few sentences. One thing struck me, though — its strong emphasis on communication technology’s ability to isolate people.
Throughout the play, the main character describes strangers jabbering away on cell phones, totally unaware of the life going on around them. The idea is bleak, but it’s not unheard of. The media — professional and otherwise — constantly produce commentary about the ways technology cripples our ability to deal with real human contact, but that might not be the case. We should not view technology as something that governs our lives.
In all, there’s a whole lot wrong with this portrait.
On the other end of the spectrum, companies like Facebook and Google proclaim technology turns society into a hub of positive human interaction. In 2010, Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg said his team is “building a web where the default is social.”
There’s a whole lot wrong with this portrait, too.
Why does the dichotomy need to exist? It’s a simplistic product of hasty conclusions and marketing. Though all devices are designed for different uses, technology itself doesn’t have inherent values like “good” or “bad;” to follow that line of thinking is to forget who’s in power. The machines don’t use us. We use them.
Instead of seeing communication technology through this divisive lens, we should recognize it for what it is: a set of tools. We can use these tools to meet people or shut people out. Either way, it’s a choice.
The cell phone demonstrates the incongruity of this divide. All around campus, people match the descriptions in Dead Man’s Cell Phone.
Many students walk to class with cell phones glued to their ears, eyes fixed on a random point in the distance.
Yet, in the process of ignoring our surroundings, we’re often using our time to communicate with the people who are most important to us.
Without cell phones, many of us would go for weeks without talking to our friends and family.
It’s funny that some older people use cell phones as proof that our generation is disconnected. According to the Social Issues Research Centre, however, texting functions as “social grooming,” a kind of mobile stop-and-chatting that actually strengthens relationships.
Instead of revolving around categorization, the conversation needs to be about usage. There’s no reason to blame communication technology for destroying our relationships, or to lavish it with praise for making us more social.
We need to ask ourselves how to make the best of what’s already being created. Silicon Valley certainly isn’t going away.
Plenty of other technologies developed outside of Silicon Valley also connect and disconnect. Blogging platforms are no different. Tumblr, for example, is designed to let bloggers take bits and pieces of the Internet and scrapbook them. It’s quite possible to become glued to the computer, collecting these pieces and finding new things to post — just search “Tumblr addiction” on the search engine of your choice.
But Tumblr also generates local meet-ups, introducing bloggers to nearby residents with similar interests. These people would have never found each other if they hadn’t spent some quality time with their screens.
Knowing people use technology for such different purposes, how can anyone describe it as isolating or connective? It’s both.

The following incidents were reported in the USC Dept. of Public Safety incident report summary on Monday, Oct. 3.
Crimes against property
At 2:43 P.M., a student at Sigma Phi Epsilon reported the theft of his cellular phone. He had left the phone on the back seat of a taxi and when he called the number the driver answered. The driver agreed to return the phone to the student and stated that he was on his way back to Sigma Phi Epsilon Fraternity, but he failed to show and the student was unable to contact him again.
Miscellaneous incidents
At 10:51 p.m., DPS officers responded to a staff member who was struck by a three-wheeled patrol vehicle driven by another officer outside Heritage Hall. The staff member complained of an injury to his ankle and the officers transported him to the student health center for medical treatment.
At 9:59 P.M., a student drove a university vehicle into a pole at Parking Lot SSRI, causing minor damage to the passenger side door.
At 12:41 P.M., DPS officers responded to a student who collided with a vehicle that turned in front of her while she was riding her bike at Jefferson Boulevard and Hope Street. The student was not injured and the officers cleared the scene after assisting the involved parties with the exchange of information.
At 8:25 a.m., DPS officers responded to a report of possible liquid nitrogen leaking from a canister at John Stauffer Hall of Science.  Safety Office personnel were requested and responded. An unattended canister with an open valve was found to the rear of the building and the safety personnel and a professor confirmed that it contained liquid nitrogen. The valve was turned off and the officers cleared the scene without further incident.

You might remember months back, when The X Factor was literally still a foreign concept to the United States. All we could do across the pond was marvel at the Youtube videos that would pop up the day after each episode aired. These videos created loads of buzz that eventually helped the show transition to Hollywood.
One of the most successful internet sensations to come out of the European X Factor was Cher Lloyd. Her rendition of Soulja Boy’s “Turn My Swag On” has garnered more than 17 million views on Youtube. From there, its history.
Though Lloyd only made it to the final four of the performance competition, she might have been the show’s biggest and most promising star. Her combination of pop, hip hop and R&B yielded entertaining and impressive performances. It was only time before Lloyd was destined to become an international star.
A couple of months ago, Lloyd debuted her first single from the upcoming album Last One Standing (awkward, since she was the fourth-to-last one standing…), “Swagger Jagger,” which eventually topped the UK singles chart. Despite the song’s inane lyrics, Lloyd is definitely on to something with her music stylings. The song is catchy and could possibly become a cross-over hit.
But what really sells the song is the music video. The bubbly cartoon animation complimented by the energetic dance stylings of the crowd of dancers create a massively appealing interpretation of what is a pretty darn good urban dance track.
Now it’s October and Lloyd is back with a surefire fourth-quarter radio hit. The music video for “With Ur Love” has just premiered and it features the moderately successful Mike Posner. Though she tones down the color scheme with a pastel filter over the footage, her vibrance is still noticeable and definitely the marketable aspect of her personality.
Lloyd spits out faux-rap vocals over the simple bumping beat like Rihanna in “Rude Boy.” The chorus soars to new heights as the singer shows of her actually vocal abilities. But its that “swag” that Lloyd loves to reference that really gives her sound that unique “X Factor.”
Posner’s verses on the track are chilled out and very complimentary of the style of the song. The two artists’ personalities definitely have chemistry, which you can actually see when they goof off in the closing seconds of the video.
 
 
I LOVE CHER LLOYD!

Angelina Jolie was honored at the United Nations Refugee Agency Awards ceremony held in Geneva, Switzerland on Oct. 3.
She was recognized for her work as a UNHCR Goodwill Ambassador in the last 10 years. She also presented the Nansen Refugee Award to the Yemeni aid group Society for Humanitarian Solidarity. The next day, she announced plans for a new role to deal with the refugee crisis.
At the ceremony, the actress was overcome with emotion and fought back tears as she came on the stage.
“Most of all I’m so grateful – I don’t want to cry – to the refugee families that I have the honor and privilege to spend the last years with,” Jolie said. “From them I’ve learned so much. I’ve learned to be a better person, a better mother. They’ve inspired me by showing me the unbreakable strength of the human spirit.”
Speaking the next day at the UNHCR’s governing Executive Committee’s annual meeting, Jolie said, “Today, three-quarters of a million people are at risk of death in the next four months in the Horn of Africa. The work we are doing needs to scale up to meet the needs of these individuals. How we continue to respond to this period of malnutrition and famine is going to define the work of those NGOs, governments, and international organizations working in the Horn of Africa. It will, quite starkly, determine whether a huge number of people live or die.”
Reuters reported some UNHCR sources to be saying that she could be named as Special Representative on the Afghan refugee situation, to help resolve the fate of 2.7 million Afghan refugees in Pakistan and Iran.
Jolie later confirmed talks for her new role. However, she stated that nothing had been finalized yet.
Jolie has been an active goodwill ambassador for the UN ever since the announcement in August 2001. She has been to 20 different countries, including as Afghanistan, Chad, Pakistan and Sudan, as part of her duties.

It’s hard to believe that after 23 seasons, sheer exhaustion won’t kill The Simpsons — but money just might.
It was announced Oct. 4 that unless the famed voice cast agrees to take a 45 percent pay cut — from the $8 million they receive a year to just over $4 million — Fox sees no other alternative but to cancel the show.
The uncomfortable reality is that despite the show’s incredible effect on pop culture, ratings are down. As it stands, despite the boatloads of money Fox makes on reruns and merchandising, Fox is losing money producing current episodes. Economically, the decision makes a depressing amount of sense.
The few recent episodes I have seen demonstrate the show can still bring it. Because only 7 percent of the audience is watching, the show rightly feels it can really stretch its boundaries and produce unique work. I’d hate to say the cast might need to take a pay-cut in order for the show to continue, but Fox could also give an inch: by giving the voices of the famed yellow family a percentage of the merchandising rights that they stubbornly refused to hand over earlier this year.
Of course, much discussion centered around when The Simpsons’ glory days ended, and how it should have gracefully exited years ago, but I have a hunch that even the “yellow purists” aren’t really contemplating what a world without The Simpsons would be like. No ‘SC undergrad has lived in a world without The Simpsons. This is a show that celebrated middle-class America, with all it’s foibles; it would truly be sad to see it go. =
