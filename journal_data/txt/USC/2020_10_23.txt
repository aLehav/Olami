While volunteering at local food banks during the ongoing coronavirus pandemic, a group of students realized that nationwide shortages on food and supplies have led to a decrease in donations, placing unhoused populations, who are already vulnerable, at a higher risk of contracting the coronavirus. 
To help alleviate these disparities, several students teamed up to rally volunteers, set up an assembly line with socially distanced tables and compiled sanitary kits one by one. In the process, Hope Hearted, a nonprofit organization dedicated to providing food and sanitary supplies to unhoused populations in the Bay Area, was born. 
To help protect these vulnerable populations, Hope Hearted began distributing sanitary supply kits, including masks and hand sanitizer, at shelters and food banks across the Bay Area beginning in mid March. 
“We want to essentially bridge the access gap in COVID sanitary supplies, and make sure that the unhoused community have access to the same sanitary supplies that the average person did,” said Chloe Duckworth, a sophomore majoring in computational neuroscience and COO of Hope Hearted. “They don’t have access to the same health care that the average person does, so they’re also more likely to be put in the ICU and to die from COVID than the average person.”
After seeing this need, Chloe and her sister Heather, along with Asavari Gowda and Quynh Nguyen, formed Hope Hearted. 
One of Hope Hearted’s partners is Second Harvest, a food bank in California whose mission is to end hunger in Santa Cruz County by providing fresh produce for those in need while also working to erase the stigma associated with food banks. Since March, Second Harvest has served almost 3,000 families a week, nearly three times as many as it averaged before the pandemic began, according to Josue Barajas, the organization’s nutrition programs director. 
Jazmin Ponce, Second Harvest’s community engagement coordinator, helped establish the partnership between the two organizations. Ponce said she believes partnering with Hope Hearted was a great way to combine both organizations’ vision for the community, allowing residents to access both food and sanitary supplies. 
“It is a difficult time right now, and when [Hope Hearted] went to one of our sites in September, the participants were really surprised and really happy that they were able to get a goodie bag at the end of the day when they got their food,” Ponce said. 
To raise money for these supplies, Hope Hearted set up a donation box through its website to expand its donor network beyond friends and family. The organization also partners with local groups, including Girl Scout troops, that help them fundraise.
“The community has really come together and tried to help the unhoused through our organization. We’ve received so much support, even from people that couldn’t donate but they would share it on their Facebook,” Chloe said. “[Even if] small businesses couldn’t donate, they would post [our] flyer and talk about us to the customers. Things like that really inspired me and encouraged me to keep going because I know that I had the support of the community, which was really meaningful.”
Currently, Hope Hearted relies primarily on community donations to fund its projects, but the organization hopes to achieve more corporate sponsorships from businesses that are financially able to provide larger donations, according to Chloe, who focuses primarily on financial tracking and transactions. 
“I’d like to scale up so we’re not constantly asking the community for money when everyone is struggling financially right now,” she said. “That doesn’t really feel right, so I’m trying to get more corporate sponsorships and apply for grants from larger foundations that are able to provide $1,000 here and there to basically sustain our operation.” 
As of now, Hope Hearted’s partners include Costco, Target and Lucky’s, all of which donated store credit for the organization to buy supplies. The organization also received funding from local council members in Fremont and other community funds for the work they’ve done. 
Sarah Daoudi, a USC sophomore majoring in neuroscience, is a volunteer at Hope Hearted who helps with the distribution of sanitation kits. Through her work at the organization, Daoudi said she has witnessed the benefits of the organization’s pledge to make sure supplies are being put to proper use. Before Hope Hearted was an established organization, the students received donations from hospitals, such as O’Connor Hospital, which kickstarted the project that became the foundation for the organization. Oftentimes, supplies are thrown out by hospitals if the material does not meet their strict standards, Daoudi said. 
By partnering with local hospitals, Hope Hearted ensures that they are making full use of all resources so that supplies are not being wasted while others are struggling to get access to them.
“[Hope Hearted] started out as an initiative to not waste,” Daoudi said. “They began reallocating resources to make sure everyone’s getting the best use out of everything.” 
Because of the coronavirus pandemic, members of the unhoused population are in need of  products they need to survive. For Hope Hearted, its mission is to help make these supplies more accessible, Chloe said.
“The overall response that we’ve received has been overwhelmingly positive,” Chloe said. “People are very grateful to be getting the supplies that we’re just giving them.”

On Sept. 22, the White House issued an executive order banning federally-funded entities from using “blame-focused” diversity training. Ingenuously named the “Executive Order on Combating Race and Sex Stereotyping,” Executive Order 13950 characterizes the concept of white privilege and systemic inequality as a “destructive” and “malign ideology.” This initiative is just the latest attempt of the current administration to push back against the anti-racist movement.  
However, the order is based on fallacious logic that willfully misinterprets the past and present of the United States. President Donald Trump’s lies have suppressed diversity and inclusion efforts in higher education throughout the United States, potentially subverting USC’s ability to work toward racial justice.
From the outset of the order, the president has relied on falsehoods to mischaracterize diversity training as hurtful toward white people. As its impetus, the order lists four different programs, the first of which was a seminar held by the Department of the Treasury. The president specifically claimed that it “promoted arguments that ‘virtually all White people, regardless of how ‘woke’ they are, contribute to racism.’”
Simple fact-checking proves this is not the case. Snopes, an online fact-checking platform, found that the quote originated not from the seminar but from a Ted Talk that the seminar suggested as a resource. More importantly, guest speaker Howard Ross clarified that the seminar’s overall message was “how can we work together?” and that Ross actually discouraged demonizing white people. Whatever the validity of an argument generalizing all white people, the reality is that President Trump used decisive lies to substantiate an official executive order.
Moreover, the order resorts to blanket statements to describe the complex range of research findings about diversity training. It claims that “research also suggests that blame-focused diversity training reinforces biases and decreases opportunities for minorities.” The president is clearly seeking to portray diversity training as counter-productive.
To be fair, some studies have found that mandatory training can spark backlash, reinforcing stereotypes against marginalized communities. A 2019 Wharton study found that voluntary training had no effect on white and male trainees. However, it led some people to recognize their own racial and gender biases. 
Diversity training isn’t perfect, but it is a decent first step. The solution to any problems inherent in diversity training is certainly not to ban it outright.
Ultimately, Executive Order 13950 stems from a wider culture war for control over the United States’ national narrative. Previously, the president held the White House Conference on American History to criticize critical race theory as “toxic propaganda” and threatened to cut funding from schools that used the 1619 Project, which retells U.S. history through the lens of Black Americans. The current administration is determined to force educational institutions to adopt its narrative that systemic racism no longer harms Americans today.
In reality, evidence for systemic racism’s continuation is impossible to ignore. For example, public policy has continuously prevented racially marginalized groups from accessing good homes, whether it be through denial of suburban homeownership or gentrification to spike housing prices. The result is a persistent racial wealth gap which traps Black, Latinx and Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders in a vicious cycle of economic turbulence, preventing them from accessing better opportunities. This is but one example in an ocean of interwoven and nuanced manifestations of systemic oppression, and any attempt to censor these truths from the public constitutes a type of warfare.
The national community of historians has even stepped forward to oppose the president’s denial of systemic racism. The American Historical Association issued a statement criticizing the president’s attempt “to purge history of its unsavory elements and full complexity,” calling it a “disservice to history.” It was joined by 46 other history organizations.
This unwarranted attack on diversity training has already rippled nationwide, stifling higher education’s ability to address issues of identity and justice. Fearing that the directive’s broad language applied to all employees, the University of Iowa suspended all training on race and sex stereotyping. John A. Logan College in Illinois canceled a Hispanic Heritage Month talk and a military academy canceled a screening of Malcolm X, a Black history movie.
The president’s lies prevent colleges and universities from telling the truth. They stifle academic freedom, cheating students of opportunities to expand their horizons and challenge their narrow preconceptions. Without the ability to declare systemic inequality a problem, higher education is incapable of holding productive problem-solving discussions.
USC’s anti-racist efforts are especially vulnerable to Executive Order 13950’s repressive prohibitions. The University has already fallen short on a practical level; after five months, school policy and curriculum have seen little concrete change. If anything, its efforts have been largely performative.
The executive order may deliver President Folt the perfect excuse to roll back the University’s inadequate reforms. This would undermine years of hard-fought advances in racial justice, allowing discrimination to go unchallenged and racial tensions to fester.
Ultimately, the executive order’s consequences stretch beyond the ivory tower or even the future of diversity training. They have serious implications on how Americans understand their past and the path towards a better future. If the White House truly wants to lead America toward a new era of greatness, it must acknowledge the reality of systemic racism.

British singer-songwriter James Bay stuck to his roots by performing at the iconic Shakespeare’s Globe in London Oct. 21 to bring his fans worldwide a uniquely personal online viewing experience. 
Making the most of the legendary setting with wowing camera shots and angles, Bay offered four different livestreams to accommodate listeners from different time zones. His incredible vocal talent shone with the lack of overwhelming crowd noise or excessive background instrumentals. Vocal runs showed off his ability to conquer all octaves, and the entire show demonstrated his grasp of styles ranging from folk to soul to rock.
The livestream began with stunning shots of the London skyline lit up at night backed by subtle guitar instrumentals. The camera panned down to what appeared to be Bay sitting on top of a wooden house. Holding his single electric guitar, he dove into a rendition of “Scars.” He set the understated, emotional and comforting tone with how personal the performance felt, aided by close-up camera angles that would not be possible in a live show. His flawless live vocals and range jumped out from the start, accompanied by his electric guitar’s raw sound.
As he closed the song, the camera panned down to a more traditionally Shakespearian set where his entire band was set up, backed by stunning marble columns and architectural detailing. Bay’s second song, “Peer Pressure,” added in drums, keyboard and guitar players and backup singers. However, he stayed true to the folk feel by sitting and playing guitar with the band in an understated plaid flannel and a leather jacket.
For the first time, Bay stepped out of the music to address the viewers, and his genuine personality jumped out.
“We are as London as it gets,” Bay said. “It’s been a weird year, I know you know, but if this is how we can do it, then this is how we’ll do it. And it’s just so nice to have you with us.”
The next song, just a couple of weeks old, “Chew On My Heart,” called on his upper range while switching between his full, soulful sound. His acoustic guitar complemented the emotional lyrics that categorize Bay’s songs.
Seamlessly tuning and switching out the guitars between songs, Bay next threw it back to his second album, “Electric Light,” for a performance of “Us.” The yellow uplighting and subtle fog rolling across the stage added to the warm feel. However, Bay pointed out that it is actually very cold in London in October.
Bay exclaimed “feels good” after songs and laughed with his bandmates, showing their close and genuine bond. Even through the screen, it was clear how excited they were to get the chance to perform, even if not in the traditional sense. 
“It’s still a gig, we still get to play and it’s such a beautiful place,” Bay said.
Bay’s most famous song, “Let It Go,” came next, and it sounded almost identical to the recording in the best way. The hit, made famous by its 2015 re-release, is categorized by its story of a crumbling relationship and blues and rock undertones. Some artists change the octaves of tricky notes in live performances, especially if it’s cold outside, which can strain the voice. However, Bay never shied away from the high parts. True to the hit record, the background vocals were only meant to highlight Bay’s unique, raspy voice.
“I hope everybody can feel at home, the excitement,” Bay said. “We got to do all the things we love to do in the middle of this crazy year. It’s a lot of fun sort of reinventing songs for a special occasion.”
He then went into a live version of “If You Ever Want To Be In Love.” Bay’s vocal endurance came in clutch as he gave one of his most impressive renditions. He kept the performances passionate, reflecting his love-song niche yet understated with a not-too-flashy show.
The next segment was a personal highlight: Bay walked off the stage, and the viewers got a glimpse of the exterior of the famous theater with exposed wood details that could not have fit his aesthetic better. Bay entered a dark room lit by a few light bulbs and old-fashioned lamps casting moody shadows on his face. The atmosphere reflected the song’s somber tone as he played “Break My Heart Right” on a single keyboard. The moving piece was complemented by the delicate high notes of the keyboard.
The performance smoothly transitioned into a cover of “Life on Mars?” by David Bowie. Bay altered it just enough to fit his style, but his vocal run on the lyrics “It’s the freakiest show” resembled Bowie’s voice.
For a drastic tone shift, upbeat instrumentals and beats came in as he returned to the main stage. The performance became distinctly energetic, with the entire band standing, clapping and incorporating electric guitar riffs and solos as well as banging drumsticks. The uplighting turned an electric blue for “Pink Lemonade,” matching the more alternative, disco vibe of the track’s music video. The song shows his ability to switch style and genre to a rock feel. His song “Craving” shows how Bay can pair emotional lyrics about his childhood and hometown with an energetic performance typical of a rocker.
The seamlessness of the entire performance shows how well-rehearsed, flawlessly planned and coordinated the virtual performance was. The great chemistry with his band, which he shouted out in between songs, was a significant bonus.
For the final section of the performance, the stage darkened, and pink dotted lights vaguely mimicked the effect of an audience waving lighters. This not only made it feel more like a live performance but fit well with “Wild Love,” in which Bay sings, “where the lights burn low.”
The technical preparation remained impressive through “Best Fake Smile,” with flashing lights syncing up with the rhythmic high hat.
“Hold Back the River,” a lively song dedicated to missing his family while touring and being taken away by the never-ceasing flow of life, rounded out the show. Bay balanced the folksy, soul beginning and latter rocker vibe. The song had a soulful, gospel feel with harmonies while remaining true to his usual discography tone. Bay appeared to have fun with the entire performance as he ended with a clapping section, which made you feel like you were in the audience. His consistent energy and positivity were refreshing in the midst of difficult circumstances.
“We know you’re out there, and we feel you,” Bay said. “And thank you so much for getting a ticket and tuning in. Cannot wait to have you back in the room with us and us be in the room with you. I hope you’re safe. Sending loads of love.”
Bay ended with an impressive run on the moving lyrics “Let us hold each other” — unintentionally an excellent metaphorical message for these times.

It’s almost two weeks from USC’s first conference matchup on Nov. 7, and the Trojans are closing out this week of camp with high hopes. 
Deemed “Hell Week,” players wore pads every day, bringing the physicality and competitiveness that focuses on ball security on the offense and four-man rushes along the defensive line.
Head coach Clay Helton noted in a Thursday press conference that this practice schedule is integral to having any sort of success this season, especially without a spring camp. Helton also credited the competitive spirit that the team brings every day to offensive coordinator Graham Harrell and defensive coordinator Todd Orlando.
“I think it really has started with the coordinators. I’ve got two guys that probably are the most competitive souls I’ve ever been associated with,” Helton joked. 
Orlando, who joined as defensive coordinator this spring, has focused on growing the talent of the existing defensive line, especially junior safety Talanoa Hufanga. 
“In choosing a coordinator for this position, I don’t know if I was just fortunate or lucky, but TO’s system just fits our personnel so well,” Helton said. “And the variety of different fronts and coverages that he gives — it was really made for Talanoa.”
Hufanga is coming even more into his own after already being considered one of the country’s top safeties. According to Helton, Hufanga has shown his versatility in his healthiest camp yet as a post safety, box safety and flat-zone defender — all positions that highlight his man-to-man coverage skills.
Determining the starting defensive lineup might be one of the hardest decisions to make going into the first game against Arizona State. With lineman vets such as redshirts junior Marlon Tuipulotu and senior Caleb Tremblay bringing discipline to the front, Helton sees potential for newcomers like redshirt freshman Stanley Ta’ufo’ou and freshman Kobe Pepe to apply pressure to quarterbacks in a primarily passing league. 
Over the past few scrimmages, the defense has been running four-man rushes that have gotten to the quarterback a number of times, which Helton sees as a benefit of Orlando’s decision to drill down a handful of plays rather than overwhelm the group with a dozen new ones. It’s the kind of performance “that wins championships,” Helton said.
The starters against Arizona State won’t be named until the Friday before the matchup, just as with last season, according to Helton.
The rest of this Hell Week will take the Trojans to the Coliseum field Friday night for passing and simple drives under the stadium lights. Saturday will start out with a 6 a.m. scrimmage —  an early start meant to prep the team for the 9 a.m. start time against ASU.
Helton’s hopes come from the team’s ability to continue adapting to the circumstances and rising to the challenges that precede them. 
“There’s three things that have really stood out to me, not only during this camp but since we’ve left this place March 15,” Helton said. “One has been their mental toughness, in being able to handle adverse situations, and the toughness they’ve shown on the field … The second thing has just been their discipline … and lastly, they’ve done it together.”

Results from a USC Student Health antibody testing study conducted in May show that the vast majority of students had remained vulnerable to the coronavirus. While it is still unclear how much protection antibodies can offer amid the pandemic, the study, which was published in the Journal of Adolescent Health Oct. 15, can potentially help Student Health pinpoint coronavirus cases during cold and flu season. 
The cross-sectional study aimed to determine how much of the USC student population had contracted the virus by analyzing the prevalence of COVID-19 antibodies in student blood samples from April 29 to May 8. According to the study, of the nearly 800 students who answered a questionnaire and had their blood drawn at Student Health, only 4% — 31 students — developed antibodies, indicating prior infection.
“We tried to do that timeframe … because what we want to do is to get an estimate of the incidence in our population before everybody left, because we weren’t sure if people are traveling back and forth, if there was an increase in risk,” said Dr. Vladimir Ayvazyan, an assistant professor of clinical family medicine at the Keck School of Medicine, in an interview with the Daily Trojan. 
According to the study, the 4% prevalence of antibodies is similar to what has been reported in prior population studies in both Los Angeles County and Santa Clara County. Based on these results, the study determined that the virus was not widely circulating among students by the time USC transitioned to a virtual format in mid-March, and the spread of infection at USC reflected local public health conditions in May.
“If we had a large proportion of students showing antibodies, indicating that the virus was widely circulating in our community between January and April, this could have informed our safety plans. But the rate was low,” said Co-Medical Director and Faculty Physician of Internal Medicine Dr. Kimberly Tilley, the lead author of the study, in an Oct. 16 press release.
Additionally, the study found that 81% of students who tested positive for antibodies reported loss of smell or taste, symptoms specific to the coronavirus and not influenza. This finding can help doctors narrow in on coronavirus cases during cold and flu season, Ayvazyan said.
“It’ll be really interesting to look at in the future,” Ayvazyan said. “But at this point, this was actually one of the questions that whenever we’re doing the interviews for contact tracing and the symptomatic patients. We would always ask because it would give us an idea of whether or not the coronavirus risk was present in the patient population.”
However, Ayvazyan stressed that loss of taste and smell are not the only coronavirus-related symptoms to be wary of moving forward, since there are other symptoms such as shortness of breath, cough and fever that are not exclusive to the coronavirus. 
“This is why USC has implemented the Pop Testing [provided by external testing distributor Color] … which allows us to test a higher volume of students,” Ayvazyan said. “So I don’t think necessarily we need to focus on one particular clinical symptomatology. Although we have noticed in our study that most of [the participants] at that time period had a loss of taste and smell, that doesn’t necessarily mean that this is the only thing you need to have in order to be positive.”
The study noted that there is “not a strong argument” in issuing widespread antibody testing to inform reopening decisions for college campuses, especially when it is not known how much protection antibodies provide in already-infected individuals. According to Ayvazyan, the reopening of universities will depend on social distancing, contact tracing, rigorous testing for infection and other measures to mitigate spread.
According to Chief Health Officer Dr. Sarah Van Orman, Student Health is considering a follow-up to the study for specific student populations. Since May, USC has experienced multiple outbreaks, so much that in early September, University Park Campus had the fastest growing rate of coronavirus cases in L.A. County. 
“We are actually considering repeating it, particularly among some of our groups of students who we know had a lot of disease,” Van Orman said in a student media briefing Thursday. “I think it’s really important though that we still are not at all at a situation where any indicators are that we have enough infection for there to be herd immunity, and … people are not even sure herd immunity is an important concept with COVID.”

Like everywhere else, the sports world has not been the same since the coronavirus made its way across the globe. All NBA, WNBA and NHL games were confined to small bubble formats while the MLB season was shortened significantly. The World Cup and Olympics were postponed. In-person fan attendance as we knew it was suddenly eliminated from our sports-viewing experiences until further notice.
Enter the NFL. Recent team outbreaks — most notably the Tennessee Titans — have many speculating if the league will fully cancel its season.
News flash: The NFL won’t cancel the season, and it shouldn’t. There’s too much money involved, and one team should not be enough to ruin it for everyone else.
While world economies and sports leagues entered deep hell when the coronavirus pandemic hit, the NFL seemed to stay relatively calm. Sure, the coronavirus CBA negotiation period between the Players’ Association and the league itself was a little “bumpy,” so to speak, but both sides got through it in a very timely manner.
To get to my point, I gotta talk about baseball real quick. The MLB negotiations with players earlier in the year were so messy that the season truly was in jeopardy. They got it done eventually — a 60-game season in home markets — but they were soon faced with multiple teamwide outbreaks (I’m looking at you, Miami Marlins and St. Louis Cardinals).
The NFL changes include smaller practice squads, opt-out options and no preseason. However, the NFL still wanted fans in the stands at limited capacities, games in home markets and a full 16-game schedule as planned.
When the outbreaks happened with baseball — which is a limited-contact sport — there was widespread debate about whether MLB should throw everything out the window and cancel. Low and behold, however, the World Series is finishing this month.
The Titans recently had an outbreak that was largely exacerbated in part due to careless gatherings and decision-making by players. They were able to get their Week 4 game rescheduled and were threatened with receiving a loss if too few players were healthy enough to play in Week 5.
What the NFL did with the Titans is undoubtedly the correct thing to do. Reschedule the game if you can. If you can’t, the team should be forced to take a loss.
It’s a tough realm to enter because rescheduling games for an unhealthy opponent unfairly affects other healthy, willing and able teams’ schedules. So, even though the NFL is unlikely to cancel the season and players are tested daily, it’s important for players to exercise caution. If — God forbid — enough teams get infected for there to not be enough games in a given week, the NFL might face a brick wall.
According to Forbes, the NFL is losing 38% of its total revenue already this year. Commissioner Roger Goodell could, literally, not afford to lose any more games. The fans who view football as a secondary sort of religion, they don’t want to see their Sunday prayers unfulfilled — and they won’t.

My introduction to the fandom subculture was sudden and explosive.  
Like many good things, it began at 2 a.m. On a segment of the “Late Late Show,” I watched a group of seven South Korean boys navigate Los Angeles traffic with a surprising sense of humor and unexpected enthusiasm. When 5 a.m. rolled around, I had already devoured every video of their appearances on “Ellen,” “The Tonight Show,” “America’s Got Talent” and “The Voice.” 
There is no contest that BTS is a worldwide phenomenon but up until that night I had always been apathetic toward them. Initially, I was drawn to the idol group purely out of curiosity about their rise to global stardom. A week later, I could officially be declared a fan. 
As they took on ambitious vocal performances, hard-hitting rap verses and intricate dance sequences, I jumped headfirst into its fandom, ARMY. There were YouTube compilations to watch, BTS Run episodes to binge and online concerts to attend. I was thoroughly educated, learning what a “bias” means (mine is Namjoon), what the “Maknae line” is and that V and Jimin are best friends. 
A few months ago, I didn’t know what BTS stood for, much less the names of its members. Now, I can give you detailed, perhaps unnecessary, explanations of their personal quirks, favorite hair colors and the order in which each member joined the band. 
At first, I rationalized my whirlwind courtship with the Bangtan Boys as a fixation borne out of boredom during the pandemic. I told myself it would fade, and I wouldn’t have any reason to worry or be embarrassed. 
In doing this, I was doing a disservice to BTS, myself and fandoms all over the world.
I have always been wary of boy bands and teen artists. This no doubt stemmed from the fear of being typecast as the hysterical teenage fangirl. In middle school, I was a huge critic of Justin Bieber, largely because I hated the way his fans were viewed as extreme, fanatical and superficial, as people who didn’t know any better. For years, I maintained a safe distance from Bieber, One Direction and 5SOS until it was deemed reasonable to like their music openly. 
In retrospect, I’ve realized how ignorant I was. In actively avoiding such artists and fans, I was effectively telling my peers that their views weren’t valid. Our culture tells us time and time again that there is something wrong with having a predominantly tween girl fanbase in pop music. It questions the legitimacy of artists and doesn’t recognize their competency unless they cater to a more “sophisticated” or “cultured” audience (i.e adults and men). Language such as “fangirl” and “groupies” are heavy with negative connotations that demean the safe space that fandoms can provide. There’s a form of internalized misogyny that manifests itself as guilt or shame in young women and discounts our opinions as unreliable and easily swayed. 
It follows that BTS is often criticized for its enormous, predominantly female fan base, and despite their record-breaking success with the new single “Dynamite,” they are viewed as unworthy of being an international standard. For instance, one of my high school friends recently informed me that BTS’s claim to fame can only be attributed to the members’ attractive features that girls “go crazy for.” Out of all the xenophobic, homophobic and sexist rhetoric the group has been subjected to, this comment was the one I took most personal offense to. 
If sexual appeal and attractiveness were the only things that mattered, I’d argue that there would be many groups more popular than BTS, especially considering that the members don’t fit Western male beauty standards. What makes BTS so beloved is that they create music that touches people regardless of racial, cultural or language barriers. Whether you prefer the songs that are catchy and easy to sing along to (“DNA” or “Boy with Luv”) or their ballads about mental health and growing pains (“Spring Day” or “00:00”) or simply to be amused by their interactions with each other, the band produces a large variety of content that makes it hard to dislike (when you go in with an open mind).
It should go without saying that if you feel the need to criticize such artists, do so on the basis of their art, not on how they rose to fame, who their fandom consists of or at the expense of women. 
Somewhere on the road to the present, society decided that women were vapid, fickle and heavily influenced by a pretty face and good haircut. The adolescent girl, with hormones to spare, is patently the most unreliable of the bunch. In the context of pop culture (and arguably life), the consensus is that girls like me are unable to think critically and form informed decisions on what we like or dislike. It’s almost instinctual to question the credibility of our preferences. 
This is accompanied by the defeated understanding that things I like or enjoy become free real estate for people to find fault in. 
Whether you notice or not, most of us subscribe to this ideology, and it impacts the attitude we have toward life. Young female fans are undeniably major drivers for revenue in the music industry and are key to raising sales and awareness for artists. It seems unfair that the same demographic that led to the rise of the Beatles, Beyoncé, The 1975, Justin Timberlake, Taylor Swift and Harry Styles are not given the credit they deserve. If we continue to equate female excitement with hysteria, passion with infatuation and appreciation with tastelessness, we risk creating generations of women with a lack of confidence in themselves and their decisions. 
As I write this column, a small part of me still feels the need to downplay the fact that I am a fan of a boy band. I hope that if my interest in BTS ever fades, it’ll be because I can no longer relate to the music or the members, not because popular opinion tells me their celebrity is unearned or their fandom is too passionate. Until then, I’ll probably watch the “ON” Kinetic Manifesto video for the 10th time and listen to “Inner Child” until I can recite it by heart.

The intention of being inclusive is different from the act of being inclusive and that distinction is where we, as a nation and as a community, have drawn lines in the sand. 
For me, the earliest form of discrimination I experienced was on the playground. In a comical demonstration of how children mindlessly repeat what they hear at home, my first brush with subtle racism happened in my small town elementary school at recess. At midday near the plastic blue slides, I had — in my challenger’s mind — overstepped in using the section of the playground he had commandeered. Shaking with rage, he raised a pointed finger at me and bellowed with his whole chest, “You white girl!”
Though my dad had grown up here all his life, I was new to the United States, and I lived in a predominantly white community. I didn’t speak much English, and I cried from the tone of the accusation, despite the fact that he was fairly off in his profiling of me. 
I was a small girl from the Pacific Islands with a heavy accent and suntanned skin. It had to be explained to me that what was hurled at me as an insult was actually just a show of prejudice. 
Growing up with two cultures was just as confusing as this run-in with a bigoted 5 year old. I was the only one out of my siblings, cousins and family friends who was born in the Philippines and spoke fluent Tagalog. My mom, my only tie to what was more Pilipino than American, struggled with me through the assimilation pressures. 
The tangibility of microaggressions against foreigners was a subtle part of my childhood, but it was present nonetheless. Against the warm glow of a normal childhood experience, there was a quiet thread of tension. 
I remember being ashamed to bring my rice meals and Pilipino food to school. The natural desire to be affirmed by my peers was a battle waged day-in and day-out. To say the least, my formative years were a struggle of learning English, settling into life without the comforts of my homeland and learning to find my stride in this new Americanized setting. 
Later in life, I clung to the stories of author Amy Tan, finding uncanny similarities between her stories and my own. It felt like some aspects of myself were being welcomed with open arms while others were not. 
Without being told, I found cues within society that signaled there was a specific part of me that was favored over others. It never needed to be said aloud that the part of me that was Western and spoke with the trademark Californian drawl was that part.
Perhaps it’s human nature to discriminate between what is foreign and what is familiar, but I don’t believe that we should be content with calling ourselves inclusive if this inclusivity is merely nominal. 
While our politicians and media preach about the inclusivity of U.S. society, microaggressions toward immigrant Americans run rampant, rendering assimilation a prerequisite to claiming the label “American.” These are harmful not only in their encouragement of blind nationalism but also for the confusion they cause immigrants when choosing how to culturally identify. 
In my case and many others, immigrant children are encouraged to adopt U.S. mannerisms and forego their existing ones. It was a gradual decline in my Tagalog speaking ability that supported this notion for me, and I was surprised to find studies solidifying the idea that bilingualism is very poorly encouraged in the U.S. education system. Our classes are taught in English by English-speaking teachers and slowly, but surely, bilingual speakers often become English speakers with varied second-language comprehension. 
Food and culture were things I lost for a period and later rediscovered. I refused to bring the aforementioned Pilipino cuisine to school and I adopted more Western trends of fashion. 
Before long, I had my favorite burger spots and I was a girl who owned more Roxy and less Lacoste — a brand name particularly beloved by the Filipino people. Without any intention of it, my likes and dislikes shifted to exhibit the effect of having U.S. friends and the role of that socialization. 
The difficulty was in discerning which of my interests were genuine and which stemmed from what I thought was expected of me. These two ways of thinking were difficult to reconcile with for a long period of time. 
With maturity came more awareness, and I was able to rediscover those parts of myself that I tried so earnestly to bury in my formative years. From sharing stories with those around me, I know I am not alone in this experience. 
Collectively, we should be striving to do better. For immigrant youth, it should not have to be a question of either-or. U.S. culture should not be characterized by the negation of a pre-existing one. 
In any case, prejudices might begin on playgrounds, but they shouldn’t continue into our adult lives. On both sides, a willingness to learn is imperative to fostering a healthier, non-divisive environment — this should be what defines the cultural narrative in America.
