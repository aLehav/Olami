Ball control · Freshman running back Ronald Jones II leads all USC tailbacks with 380 total yards on the season. His three rushing touchdowns are second to the four redshirt senior Tre Madden has racked up on the ground. – Brian Ji | Daily Trojan
After a 41-31 loss to Notre Dame in South Bend, the 3-3 Trojans will return to the Coliseum to host the No. 3-ranked Utah Utes. A loss to Utah this week would effectively knock the Trojans out of the Pac-12 South race.
Utah, on the other hand, is a perfect 6-0 heading into Saturday’s matchup. They lead the Pac-12 South while the Trojans are in fifth place, ahead of only Colorado. The undefeated Utes beat Michigan in Week 1 and have gone on to beat Oregon, Cal and Arizona State.
At the start of the season, USC was a favorite to win the Pac-12 and even compete for a national championship.
After a loss to Washington and the midseason firing of former head coach Steve Sarkisian, the Trojans are now in danger of falling below .500 and losing any chance for postseason play. A win over the highest ranked team in the Pac-12, and third highest in the nation, however, would keep the Trojans in the hunt for a Pac-12 title.
Utah is a fundamentally sound team that doesn’t commit a lot of errors. The Utes lead the Pac-12 in turnover margin, run defense and sacks allowed. They are a sound team that executes well. They have not allowed a team to score more than 24 points all season.
The Trojans, on the other hand, are a team loaded with talent and potential that can’t get their turnovers and penalties under control.
Utah senior quarterback Travis Wilson has completed nearly 70 percent of his passes this season and has thrown 980 yards and seven touchdowns. He also has 203 rushing yards and three rushing touchdowns. His consistency in the air is accompanied by a stout run game. Running back Devontae Booker is 12th in the nation with 783 rushing yards and eight rushing touchdowns.
“He’s just an unbelievably physical runner,” interim head coach Clay Helton said of Booker. “He’s a guy that reminds you of the old Roger Craig days, to be honest with you. His legs explode on contact.”
USC’s defense struggles against mobile quarterbacks like Wilson. Last week, the Trojans exposed their weakness in the trenches, as Notre Dame running back C.J. Prosise proved to be unstoppable against the Trojan defense.
On offense, redshirt senior quarterback Cody Kessler will need to get back to the consistency he displayed last season. Kessler has already thrown five interceptions this season, the total number he threw all of last year. Heading into the fourth quarter against Notre Dame, Kessler and the Trojans had a chance to win the game, but Kessler made some bad reads and threw two costly picks.
“We’ve got to eliminate those things, especially me,” Kessler said. “We’ve got to finish games.”
That’s not to say that Kessler isn’t capable of leading the offense to another 600 yard game. Utah is ranked 11th in the conference in pass defense, and Kessler is equipped with an explosive target in sophomore wide receiver JuJu Smith-Schuster, who will get him even more yards after the catch.
Smith-Schuster had six receptions for 139 yards and a touchdown against Notre Dame. Sophomore cornerback Adoree’ Jackson had an 83-yard touchdown against Notre Dame that helped the Trojans overcome a 14-point deficit in the first half.
Jackson, who plays on both sides of the ball but is listed as a cornerback, practiced on offense for the first time this season, as the mounting injuries in the running back and receiver positions have required Jackson to play more offense than defense.
“We’re dropping numbers pretty fast, so we’ve got to move guys around,” Kessler said. “But they’re doing a great job, and it’s my job to get them ready, get them prepared and be on the same page with them, because obviously in fall camp I didn’t work a whole lot with them.”
The key for the Trojans to pull off an upset is to minimize the errors and for the team to play to its full potential. The Trojans are looking to avoid losing three consecutive games for the first time since 2012.
“These kids want to go out and show the world how good they are, and we plan on doing that in these last six games,” Helton said.
Last season, the Utes handed the Trojans a 24-21 loss in Salt Lake City.
Kickoff is set for 4:30 p.m. in the Coliseum. It will air live on FOX.

Drive a little less than 60 miles south of USC, and you will find the small beach town of San Clemente, California — my hometown.
Unlike many of the surrounding cities who have multiple high schools, there’s only one in San Clemente, which is perfectly described by the school football team’s motto: one town, one team.
Come Saturday, though, this one town will be represented by players on two opposing teams.
Utah senior quarterback Travis Wilson hopes to march into the Coliseum on game day and get his first ever win back home in Southern California, while taking the No. 3-ranked Utes to 7-0.
On the other side of the ball, a trio of former San Clemente Tritons including redshirt junior wide receiver Christian Tober, freshman quarterback Sam Darnold and freshman walk-on wide receiver Jake Russell, and the Trojans will attempt to spoil Wilson’s homecoming in a game they desperately need to keep their season alive.
Wilson and Tober, who was recently awarded a scholarship, along with Stanford offensive lineman Kyle Murphy and Oregon State offensive lineman Sean Harlow, were teammates on the San Clemente team that reached the CIF-SS Pac-5 Championship game in 2011.
The younger generation in Darnold and Russell continued the tradition of San Clemente players going on to play in the Pac-12, which currently has six in the conference.
In proper fashion, USC and Utah match up during friends and family weekend in a game that carries more than just Pac-12 South implications —  for these San Clemente natives, bragging rights are on the line.
One of USC’s priorities has to be trying to stop a dual-threat in Wilson, who helped lead a game-winning drive to overcome the Trojans in Salt Lake City last year.
Standing at 6-foot-7, Wilson is probably one of the greatest athletes to ever come out of our city of about 65,000. Growing up alongside side Wilson and playing on a couple of youth sports teams with him over the years, I always knew that Wilson would make an incredible athlete one day.
I just hoped it would never come against a team in which I had ties to — wishful thinking, I guess.
USC’s secret weapon against Utah might very well be a player that doesn’t even see the field this Saturday in Sam Darnold, who is probably the closest thing the Trojans have to Wilson. He’s got an arm, is large in stature and can do a lot of damage with his feet.
Darnold, who was a freshman in high school when Wilson was a senior, is following in his footsteps — on track to continue the lineage of former San Clemente quarterbacks to start in the Pac-12. However, before he takes his first snaps under center in a game, he was given the task of simulating his elder in the Utes read-option offense.
USC coaches employed Darnold, a highly touted recruit out of high school, as the scout team quarterback against the USC first team defense.
San Clemente head  football coach Jaime Ortiz said that it is so awesome to see Darnold living his dream at USC, while watching Wilson help Utah become a force to be reckoned with on the national stage.
When Wilson originally committed to Utah, he told Ortiz that he wanted to make the Utes a national contender before it was all said and done, and he has done exactly that in his senior year.
In the process, he has also inspired a new recruiting pipeline in his home town with two San Clemente players already committed to play for the Utes. High school seniors Cole Fotheringham and Tucker Scott will try to build on the success that Wilson established, while class of 2017 quarterback Jack Sears has been extended an offer by the program.
Utah also intrigued a lot of interest in Darnold before he decided to commit to the Trojans.
Conversely, Wilson was never offered by USC and enrolled early at Utah in the spring of 2012, in which the Utes were coming off just their first season as a Pac-12 school. Just four years later, he has the Utes at the national forefront.
Wilson has overcome a lot to get to where he is today — the passing of a close friend in former UCLA player Nick Pasquale — and an almost career-ending brain injury.
In Wilson’s homecoming, the only thing standing in his way of a Pac-12 south crown now is the Trojans.

Victorious Vavic · In his 21 years as head coach, Jovan Vavic has been the recepient of an unprecedented 12 National Coach of the Year awards. – Mariya Dondonyan | Daily Trojan
Coach of the Century is a once-in-a-lifetime award, and men’s and women’s water polo coach Jovan Vavic has earned the prestigious Pac-12 honor.
“He is the most intense coach I have ever had,” sophomore goalkeeper and All-American McQuin Baron said.
Vavic has created a dynasty at USC in the 21 years he has been coaching the men’s team. Vavic currently has a .863 winning percentage for his career. During his 21-season tenure at USC, his teams have lost a mere 75 games while winning 472 and counting.
Coaching is not the only thing that garners such strong talent, and Vavic has been able to develop his program into a recruiting powerhouse, consistently bringing in top talent from around the globe. USC’s team this year features players from Australia, Canada, Italy, Montenegro and Serbia.
“He is the main reason why USC pulls in so many recruits,” Baron said. “Realistically, it’s a self-recruiting program because when I came in they had won six [championships] in a row, and everyone is like, ‘I want to win championships,’ so obviously this is where you want to go.”
Vavic has won nine NCAA championships with the men’s team, including six in a row from 2008-2013. There have been an additional four titles for the women’s team, and Vavic has led both teams to glory in the same year, sweeping the NCAA championships in 2004, 2010 and 2013.
Vavic’s experience and success is something no other program in the country can offer. Baron said coaching was an integral reason he decided to attend USC.
“[Coaching was] the biggest part,” he said. “Jovan is the most knowledgeable coach in the NCAA, and he’s the most successful coach at USC.”
Vavic’s path to success is not for the weak, and the players know that coming in. The coach runs a tight program, but one that consistently garners not only national attention for the team, but also for individual players.
Vavic has coached 10 winners of the Cutino Award, often considered the most prestigious individual award in water polo. It is given to the most outstanding player in the country every year.
Vavic’s teams generally also have a slate of All-Americans. Last season, in addition to Baron, junior Nick Bell, sophomore Mihajlo Milicevic and sophomore James Walters each earned All-American honors.
“He makes sure you are always playing to the top of your ability,” Baron said. “There are no days off.”
Vavic himself has been the recipient of many awards, being named Coach of the Year 12 times, and is the 10-time Mountain Pacific Sports Federation Coach of the Year. In 2010, Vavic swept the coaching awards, winning both National and MPSF Coach of the Year.
Vavic has high expectations that have been consistently met by the Trojans, who have never had a lower winning percentage than they did in 2002 when their record was 20-8.
Vavic has a winning record against every opponent he has ever faced. Since he began in 1995, Vavic has lost only two games to teams outside of the MPSF conference.
Last season ended in disappointment for the Trojans, who lost in the NCAA championship game to crosstown rival UCLA after six straight championships. The game marked their record 10th straight appearance in the title game.
“We’re probably the youngest team that he’s had in a really long time — we had eight or nine freshmen on the NCAA team,” Baron said of some of the team’s struggles last season. “We didn’t even have a month before we played our first game together, so now, having another year of experience playing together is definitely the biggest improvement we’ve had.”
This was supposed to be a time of rebuilding, but the Trojans have continued to build on Vavic’s legacy.
Vavic is a native of the former Yugoslavia, and earned his bachelor’s degree in history from UCLA in 1992. Vavic came to USC soon after his graduation in 1992 as an assistant coach, and then joined John Williams in 1995 as co-head coach before taking over full time in 1999 when Williams retired.
In 1996, the coaching duo earned MPSF Coach of the Year honors after leading USC to the conference title. In 1998, both he and Williams were named Coach of the Year for guiding USC to its first ever national championship. Vavic was also head of the women’s water polo program when it transitioned from Division II in 1995 to Division I in 1996.
Two years later, 1998 marked a record-breaking season for Vavic, who became the first water polo coach in history to win three national championships with three different teams. Vavic captured both the men’s and women’s national title, as well as earning the distinction with his men’s senior national club team.
Vavic’s current team has nothing but respect for their head coach and appreciates the dedication he has for them as they strive to win him his 14th national title.
“It’s well-deserved,” Baron said. “His accolades definitely prove why he got it.”
Vavic and the men’s water polo team will jump back in the pool this Sunday on the road against the University of the Pacific.

Digging success · Led by senior outside hitter Samantha Bricio, the Women of Troy are off to the fourth best start in program history. – Tal Volk | Daily Trojan
The women’s volleyball team embarks on a four-game road trip this week, beginning on Friday at Oregon State. After playing the Beavers, the No. 1 Women of Troy will travel to Eugene to take on Oregon, and they will wrap things up in Washington, where they will face Washington and Washington State for the second time this season.
USC has been No. 1 in the nation since Oct. 5. With a 20-0 record, the Women of Troy received a unanimous vote for the top spot for the first time this season in the AVCA Coaches Poll.
Not many expected such a strong season out of this year’s team. After a subpar 2014 campaign, USC went into the fall with a young team and a good deal of roster turnover. Additionally, head coach Mick Haley asked his players to adapt to a new, physical system in hopes of lifting his side’s play.
With all that in mind, it was a tall order for this 2015 team to improve on last season’s record — let alone blow it out of the water — but the players came together and responded to the challenge. The Women of Troy racked up 16 wins in total last year: a mark this season’s roster hit just over a month into its campaign.
Junior libero Taylor Whittingham, who was named Pac-12 Defensive Player of the Week for the second time in her career on Monday, praised the new members of the team for gelling with the rest of the squad so quickly after entering the program.
“The freshman came in, and we got really close with them as a group,” she said. “That helped a lot for our team’s chemistry.”
Whether it’s been the team chemistry, the new system, sheer determination or some combination of the three, the fact remains that the Women of Troy are off to their best start in over a decade. The last time the team found itself 20-0 was in 2003, when USC defeated Florida in the NCAA Tournament Final in Dallas to cap off a perfect 35-0 season. It was the second of Haley’s two championships at USC and the second consecutive tournament-winning year for the Women of Troy.
Haley refuses to look beyond the short term for now, however, knowing that playing Pac-12 rivals for the second time this season would be a tougher challenge.
“The first time through, everyone is just trying to feel each other out,” he said. “The second time, everyone’s seen the data and has seen how you play, and they’ll try to attack all of your weaknesses.”
USC will play its first rematches of the season when the team travels to Washington and Washington State. Both schools visited the Galen Center earlier in the season: The Women of Troy first swept past the Cougars 3-0 and moved on to beat the Huskies 3-1 two days later.
Before USC plays its two opponents in Washington, though, they will have to get through Oregon State on Friday and Oregon on Sunday.
The Beavers have had a tough campaign, and they sit at 4-14 going into their match against USC. The two sides split their season series last year. The Women of Troy took the first game at the Galen Center 3-1, and OSU took the second by the same score line back in Corvallis.
Oregon has endured an up-and-down season to this point, with the Ducks’ record at 10-7 going into their first game of the week against UCLA on Friday. Interestingly, they have spent most of their season so far away from home. Oregon has only played two games at the Matthew Knight Arena this year, but both have been close, five-set contests. The Ducks will look to get a boost from their home fans this weekend against the Women of Troy.
No matter the opposition, USC remains focused on executing its game plan.
“We’re just working on getting comfortable and knowing all our roles in the system,” Whittingham said.
Haley echoed his libero’s comments.
“We’re still a work in progress,” he said. “Every game, we get a little better so that it can all come together in December.”

Maggie Lee | Daily Trojan
We’ve all been there. We never want to go back there. But, for some of us, we inevitably end up back in the brutal cycle of an all-nighter. Here are the stages of an all-nighter that we are all familiar with:
Stage One: The moment before
You totally have this under control. That 12 page research paper you’ve been putting off for a month will be easily conquered by the productivity and efficiency you will have tonight. You already have a vague idea of what you need to write about and, even though you haven’t looked at the prompt yet or opened up the textbook, you’re sure the right talking points and answers will spontaneously reveal themselves in your midnight brilliance.
Stage Two: Preparing yourself
You can’t start a night of hard work without first mentally and physically preparing yourself, of course. First you have to get something to eat, but you can’t eat just anything. It has to be a big, hearty meal to get you through the long night. Of course, after you finish your meal, you just have to take a power nap. After all, how could you possibly attack that essay when you’re in a food coma. Now that you’ve prepared yourself, you just have to prepare your surroundings. That means cleaning your room to rid your surroundings of clutter, effectively clearing your mind. Now you’re ready to work.
Stage Three: The first break
You just spent three hours preparing to take on this all-nighter. You deserve a break. Open up a tab with Tumblr and then catch up with your friends’ activities on Facebook. Not studying or working for the last few hours has means that you should definitely reward yourself with continuing to not work or study, right?
Stage Four: Procrastination cycle
As a continuation of stage three, stage four will include all procrastination methods available. Some highlights include waiting to start at a certain time but, when you miss that time, insist that you’ll be sure to start again at the next time because, well, you missed this one. You message someone in your class to commiserate with them as they are probably also pulling an all-nighter. Then, repeat stages two and three until there are no more mundane tasks to complete and falsely reward yourself.
Stage Five: Actual work gets done
At this point, it’s midnight and you realize you have nothing done. An underlying panic fills you and all of a sudden you achieve pure concentration. You work for an amazing two to three hours without interruption and actually get things done.
Stage Six: Delusion
Anywhere between 3 a.m. and 5 a.m., you will begin to question all of your life choices and the concept of time disappears. Aside from your eyes being extremely heavy, you feel the burden of every decision you’ve ever made and soft crying or hysterical laughter may commence. Ultimately, stage six is a very personal experience. Everyone will devolve to delusion differently.
Stage Seven: The end
You’re finally done. The product of your night of hard work is either a masterpiece of academia or just enough to count as a completed assignment. Either way, the end has come. You may drag your semi-lifeless body to a printer to print your paper or crawl into bed for the last 15 minutes before your alarm goes off. Your night ends – or your morning begins – with a vow to never pull an all-nighter again, though you have the foresight to know that next week this cycle will repeat.

A lot will be on the line for the unranked Trojans this Saturday, when they host No. 3-ranked Utah in a game with tremendous Pac-12 South implications.
Daily Trojan sports editor Darian Nourian sat down with Utah’s Daily Utah Chronicle football beat reporter, Kim Brenneisen, to give Trojan fans a better picture of what to expect from this  Utes squad on Saturday.
Daily Trojan: What has been the main reason for Utah’s success this season?
Daily Utah Chronicle: It’s really been a complete team effort from the Utes, but it’s really the leadership of the seniors that is pulling the team. There are plenty of guys on the team competing in their final season as a Ute, so they have something to prove before year’s end. The defense, though they have not been registering as many sacks as last season, is more than making up for it in interceptions. They are not dropping balls like they have in the past and the overall intensity has increased. The offense has more of a balanced attack this year, and Utah is no longer dependent on the run game. Special teams is also doing pretty well, and Tom Hackett continues to punt balls within the other team’s 20-yard line.
DT : Is this Utah team overrated or is it a true national championship contender?
DUC : They are definitely not overrated, and even with Utah’s No. 3 ranking, analysts have them losing this game, which only motivates this team. The Utes feel like they have been the underdog for such a long time, and still feel like that, but in a more positive light than before. Being around the players, they’re confident, but not cocky. They are relaxed, but not lazy. The Utes are clicking on all cylinders, like I said before, and it certainly helps that the majority of teams in the Pac-12 are not having their best seasons.
DT : What does Utah need to work on leading up to the USC game?
DUC : Special teams without a doubt. Even though I said this is a big reason why they are playing well, it could have very well been the reason they almost lost to ASU this past weekend. They allowed a kickoff return for a touchdown and, later in the game, allowed another big gain off of a punt return. Then, most ugly of all, they had a botched trick play in which Britain Covey was flagged for an illegal forward pass in the end zone that resulted in not just a safety, but also a field goal. Whittingham called the special teams play horrible and Covey called it stupid. They certainly won’t be doing this again and will make sure to get their act together before heading on the road.
DT : Who on USC will give the Utes trouble?
DUC : The Utes are actually concerned with the entire wide receiving unit for USC, but more specifically, JuJu Smith-Schuster. Whittingham mentioned his name earlier this week and knows his secondary will need be aware of where he is on the field at all times. The Utes have yet to face someone of his caliber so it will be a real test to see if they can cover him. Smith-Schuster is a savvy wide receiver, and playmaker in general, so Utah will need to be sure to not give him any space.
DT : Who will the Trojans need to keep their eyes on?
DUC : Devontae Booker is always ready to go, and after not having an ideal three quarters last weekend, he’ll definitely want to make it up for it. Although he did not get much going throughout most of the game, he still finished with two rushing touchdowns — one of which essentially secured the Utes’ victory — and finished with 118 yards on the ground. Booker wants that Heisman and, more importantly, his teammates want it for him. They’ll do whatever it takes to get the run back on track and even if it doesn’t, he can be effective otherwise. He did a nice job picking up blocks for Wilson when he needed it and he’s also a threat catching the ball so he will keep the Trojans on their toes throughout the whole game.
DT : If Utah wins, what will be the main reason why?
DUC : Utah will win the game if two out of its three units are in sync but, most importantly, the offense. This team has been doing a good job of scoring lately, and USC surely can, too. Wilson will need to play with as much confidence as he has been doing so all season long. Also, he finally needs to hit a deep shot. Last game he attempted to throw a couple long ones and both times overthrew his receiver. Other than that, the receivers have been doing a good job of getting open and will need to continue to do the same against the Trojans. Then, Booker essentially just needs to do Booker-like things, creating more space and fighting for extra yards whenever he can.
DT : What does a win in this game mean for the Utah program and would it solifify the Utes as a new Pac-12 powerhouse?
DUC : A win validates this team even more. USC is one of the most storied college football programs, and plenty of people still have their doubts. For instance, the Utes are ranked No. 7 in the Coaches Poll — for some reason Michigan State is ranked above them even though Utah had more decisive wins against Oregon and Michigan. People overlook Utah a lot, and then, when the Utes do make any sort of noise, people are quick to assume they are not really what they seem and that they are overrated. A win against a program like USC, on the road, depicts them in a better light, but at the same time, some won’t value it because of USC’s record; so essentially, a win just keeps them in the conversation. A loss would completely deter the Utes’ chances of making the playoffs and would only verify some people’s thoughts that they aren’t good enough. A win does make the Utes a powerhouse in the Pac-12, but only for the time being. Utah will need to continue winning, and winning decisively, to be considered a true favorite.
DT : Who do you think will win and why?
DUC : I think Utah pulls out a close win in a high scoring affair, 42-39. The Utes still have a lot to prove to the entire country and will be more focused than ever to win in the Coliseum. Any loss at this point is a bad loss, and the Utes will win because they need to. They need to prove to everyone that their season is not a fluke and, in the end, they will because every single player knows what is at stake against the Trojans.

High impact · Students and alumni shared their experiences coping with the lasting impact of concussions. According to Popular Mechanics, a defensive back can exert up to 1,600 pounds of force per tackle. – Brian Ji | Daily Trojan
It takes one hit to change a life.
One hard hit, fall or tackle. That can be enough for a concussion. The result, at best, is a few hours of headache, dizziness and nausea. At worst, the injury leads to a lifetime of excruciating pain and depression.
Concussions aren’t a new topic. They’ve made headlines again and again. According to studies by the CDC, anywhere from 1.6 to 3.8 million concussions are incurred in the U.S. every year. It’s an inescapable part of athletics, yet experts remain unsure how to diagnose a concussion, and even more unsure how to treat one. Proper tools for prevention, diagnosis and treatment are still under research, but the main key to solving the concussion problem revolves around the culture of athletics itself.
The day Seau died
Few days have changed the world of football more than the day that USC alumnus Junior Seau died. It was a Wednesday in May 2012. Seau’s girlfriend found him sprawled on the floor, a self-inflicted gunshot wound to his chest. He left behind no note, only the scrawled lyrics of his favorite country music song — “Who I Ain’t” — on a piece of paper on the kitchen counter.
A year later, studies by the National Institutes of Health showed that Seau had a degenerative brain disease caused by multiple concussions when he committed suicide.
It came as a shock to the culture of football. Seau was a 12-time Pro-Bowler, 1992 NFL Defensive Player of the Year and a two-time AFC champion who would be posthumously inducted into the NFL Hall of Fame. He played hurt, he played hard and he challenged every offense he faced with his athleticism and his relentlessness. But, in the end, every hit and tackle was chipping away at Seau’s brain. The game of football killed one of its finest players.
The day that Seau died, former USC quarterback Todd Marinovich received a text from a teammate. It had been years since he’d seen Seau, but he’d followed his former teammate’s career with pride. When he read that Seau was dead, that Seau had taken his own life, he couldn’t believe it.
“It was unthinkable,” Marinovich said. “It floored me. It took my breath away. That wasn’t the Seau I knew.”
The Seau he knew was so full of life he almost burst with it. He walked into practice with a grin that crinkled the corners of his eyes. He spent endless hours in the weight room when he was sidelined for low grades. He was single-minded, too focused on football to be caught at frat parties or bars. And he was joyful — “God, was he joyful,” Marinovich said — in love with the game, in love with the team and in love with life.
And 23 years later, he killed himself. It was unthinkable, Marinovich said.
One year later, Marinovich received another text. This one was more expected. Another former teammate, a linebacker,  had died from extreme hypertension after a long struggle with alcoholism. His name was Scott Ross. Marinovich had spent the last year on the phone, trying to help Ross fight a battle with his own mind.
The Ross he’d been speaking to was not the same Ross he adored in college, who once chased Marinovich across campus for 40 minutes, shouting out a mix of curses and laughter. Ross had changed.
In his final years, he was inconsolable. Something was deeply disturbed. Marinovich couldn’t put a finger on it, but he felt the desperation in Ross’s voice as they spoke on the phone. His friend was damaged.
“What both of them became … It was different,” Marinovich said. “Something broke in them. We need to figure out how to keep these players from being broken.”
Marinovich lost two teammates in two years. They were both men he looked up to, men whose presences  he cherished. They were also both linebackers.
“It’s not an easy job,” Marinovich said of the position. “They take hits again and again and again. It’s relentless. It’s exhausting to watch. I couldn’t do what they did. I’m not sure if anyone is really meant to.”
According to a study by Popular Mechanics, the average defensive back unloads up to 1,600 pounds of force in a single tackle, often resulting in a G-load three times the force of a barrel roll in a fighter jet. A defensive player might land 100 of these hits in a single game, leading to concussion after concussion.
There wasn’t a culture surrounding concussions when Marinovich was playing with Seau and Ross. When they were playing, an especially hard hit to the head provoked a quick sideline check-up. If the trainer diagnosed a concussion, the player sat out for a play, maybe two. But then they went back in the game. They almost always went back in.
“No player wants to sit,” Marinovich said. “We all wanted back in. Junior, you could try to drag him off the field, and he would fight you the whole way. I’ve had concussions, and I’m certain Junior and Scott and all of those guys had concussions, more than we probably know.”
The culture is different now. Athletes receive concussion education at the start of each season. Last year, the Pac-12 conference cut down the number of contact practices that football teams are allowed to hold and launched a $3.6 million per year Head Trauma Task Force program. But football has only become more intense: the players bigger, the hits harder.
“It’s a violent sport,” Marinovich said. “And it’s a beautiful sport in its violence, its physical nature. That will never change.”
It’s not just football
Senior Sarah Urke can still remember the day she lost her Olympics dreams: Oct. 27, 2009.
Rewind to the start of that summer, when Urke was 16 and life was almost perfect. She moved to Santa Barbara to train with the Aquamaids, a premier synchronized swimming team that groomed athletes for the Olympics. She had no goals for the future besides an Olympic gold medal.
Then, during practice on Oct. 27, a teammate’s kick accidentally slammed into the side of Urke’s head. She surfaced in a daze. Urke sat out for five minutes, swallowed a handful of ibuprofen and dove back in to finish practice. The next morning, she woke up to a dangerous realization — something was horribly wrong.
Urke felt like she was floating. Her head pounded. Her thoughts felt disjointed. She was rushed to the hospital, then referred to a neurologist who had no formal training in treating concussions. He told her to return to physical activity “as tolerated,” so she ignored her symptoms and kept swimming.
That was a mistake. Each day was worse, plagued with dizziness and headaches. A new doctor told her to stop all activity, to stay home from school and avoid watching television.
But it didn’t get better.
When she returned to school in January, Urke couldn’t make it through a class. In February, she moved back to Minnesota and began to process that she might not be going to the Olympics anytime soon.
More than a year later, after countless consultations, a combination of rest, upper cervical realignment and physical therapy finally began to relieve Urke’s symptoms. But at this point, she had missed a full year of high school, spending most of it in bed, listening to audiobooks. And Urke had lost synchronized swimming, the entire focus of her future.
Urke wasn’t a football player. She was a dedicated athlete in a non-contact sport with a likely prospect of making the 2012 Olympic team. But on Oct. 27, 2009, a concussion shattered her world, proving that any athlete can suffer from the effects of head trauma.
Now a USC student, Urke has dedicated herself to the world of concussions. She leads support groups for other concussion victims, heads a club that raises awareness and is dedicating her research as a pre-physical therapy student to treatments for head trauma. Her main goal is to create a better understanding of how to treat a concussion.
“I was so eager to keep swimming that I just powered through the pain,” Urke said. “I know now that I probably hurt myself even more, just with those few weeks that I kept swimming. Athletes have to know when to stop. If you’re in pain, don’t fight through it. It’s not strong to fight through pain — that pain is a sign that your body needs to slow down, or stop, in order to heal.”
Searching for a solution
When it comes to recovery, pain is the ultimate sign that an athlete should stop activity. But what is the cure for a concussion? It’s a question that baffled Urke for years and that continues to challenge experts in the field.
One of the USC faculty members helping Urke to answer this question is Dr. David Baron, vice chair of the Department of Psychiatry and a national leader in concussions research. This spring, a piece of technology, Brain Injury Research Strategies, designed by Baron, won the Maseeh Entrepreneurship Prize Competition, allowing him to test a new way to approach concussion diagnosis.
When discussing diagnoses, Baron emphasized a little-known truth about concussions — they don’t require direct contact to the head. Due to the structure of the head, the brain is relatively loosely fit into the skull. During a collision, a player’s head might whip around, causing the brain to “slosh” against the sides of the skull. This means that a jarring shock to the torso can result in a serious concussion without the head-receiving contact.
“The nastiest concussion I ever saw came from a player being hit in the shoulder,” Baron said. “It’s all about the trauma that the brain is undergoing, and oftentimes that has nothing to do with an athlete hitting their head.”
This makes it even more difficult to notice when a player incurs a concussion — especially in contact sports such as football or soccer, where collisions are a necessary part of the game. At USC, Director of Athletic Medicine Russ Romano trains athletic staff to observe athletes for symptoms, especially after noticeable collisions.
“An athletic trainer is trained to observe the activity and [train] their student-athletes to look for signs and symptoms of concussion,” Romano said. “USC Athletics has taken great strides to educate all student-athletes about the signs and symptoms of concussion and the need to report those signs and symptoms immediately.”
Though trainers can pull athletes if they’re concerned, it often comes down to a test to determine if that player remains sidelined from future play. The most popular test is the ImPACT test, a computerized system that tracks an athlete’s cognitive abilities before and after an injury. Though it doesn’t actually diagnose athletes with concussions, the ImPACT test works as a first step toward treatment.
There is, however, a major flaw in the ImPACT test’s accuracy, Baron said. ImPACT relies on a baseline test, taken by each athlete at the beginning of the season. After a notable collision, the athlete retakes the test. If performance is lower than the baseline, then the athlete is considered at-risk and is sidelined until a doctor gives a proper diagnosis. Though this works for many athletes, Baron said that it is extremely easy for determined athletes to trick the test by purposefully underperforming their baseline.
“There will always be players who want to play through it, to keep fighting through injuries even when their body is begging them to stop,” Baron said. “And those are the players that will get around [the ImPACT test]. What we need is a solution, some type of diagnosis or test, that can’t be cheated.”
This is the focus of Baron’s work with BIRS, which tracks eye movement and notes slower reaction times. It is harder to fake eye movement than it is to flunk a baseline ImPACT test. Baron and his team hope that this improvement will allow for more accurate results.
What comes after a concussion diagnosis is just as uncertain. Baron said most professionals agree that full rest is necessary after a concussion, followed by a gradual return to full activity. But the timing of concussion recovery remains imperfect and frustrating for concussion experts.
“The problem is that, when it comes down to it, there’s way more that we don’t know about concussions than we do know,” Baron said. “There’s no perfect way to treat a concussion, and different things work for different people. Some players can take huge hit after huge hit, get up, and be perfectly fine. Others, it takes one hit and they’re done, career over. We don’t understand it, not yet.”
To combat this lack of knowledge, Baron stressed that precaution is a necessity in avoiding life-altering damage. Yet, while new restrictions and safer helmets can soften the blows that cause concussions, prevention is a game with too many factors to control. Treatment, Baron said, will change the world of concussions, and it begins with the players themselves.
It’s an unglamorous truth, but a vital one — there isn’t a cure for concussions.
The injury’s danger is that a bulk of the responsibility in the healing process falls directly upon the athletes themselves — athletes who are often young, inexperienced and hungry to constantly play, perform and prove themselves in their sport. In this dynamic, Baron believes that coaches and trainers alike must train their athletes to truly believe that “toughing it out” is neither admirable nor responsible.
In Marinovich’s days of playing, a rub-some-dirt-in-it mentality was accepted, but its consequences are manifesting themselves now.  Concussions are part of popular culture, but their ultimate solution is still far off and intangible. In the meantime, athletes must do the best they can, or pay hefty prices like Urke did six years ago.
“I lost years of my life because of a single kick to my head,” Urke said. “And many others pay a far steeper price. It comes down to whether or not we’re willing to make a change in who we are and how we think about our bodies and our brains. In the end, you only get one brain in this life. You have to protect it at all costs.”
Editor’s Note: A previous version of this article incorrectly stated that Scott Ross had died of suicide. Ross died of extreme hypertension with alcohol poisoning.  It also incorrectly stated that Ross was part of the 1989 team’s secondary; he was not.

Jurassic film · Matt Nolte, character art director for The Good Dinosaur, speaks at the School of Cinematic Arts Thursday evening. – Dina Colunga | Daily Trojan
An animation team from Disney Pixar was on campus Thursday night to show an exclusive behind-the-scenes screening of their upcoming adventure animation film The Good Dinosaur. To promote the film’s upcoming release, Pixar invited the USC community to the screening to learn about the character animations in the film.
Character Art Director Matt Nolte presented the film and several of his animations at the event and answered questions from the audience after the screening.
Several students and School of Cinematic Arts staff and faculty attended the event held in the SCI building. The attendees were treated to short clips, sequences and concept art created by Nolte and his animation team.
The protagonist of the film is a young dinosaur, Arlo, who is accidentally separated from his family and home. Journeying to find his way back home, Arlo befriends a human cave-boy that he names Spot.
Nolte said that a lot of the great ideas for the drawing and animation of his characters came from Peter Sohn, the director of the film.

“He is an amazing craftsman and writer. He allows us to help him and I think that is pretty cool,” Nolte said.
Nolte pointed out the primary drawings and sketches that were used in developing the characters. He also mentioned the difficulties in the process of making the characters come to life.
Nolte debated with his animation team over how to design the jaw structure of the dinosaurs in the film. He had to deviate from scientific accuracy in order to create a suitable character for the film.
“We had fun working [to] create these dinosaurs. I grew up a dinosaur fan … I was a T-Rex fan, so I was very stoked to work with these characters,” Nolte said about his enthusiasm for creating the characters of Arlo and his dinosaur family members.

When showing clips from the film, Nolte highlighted scenes of nature depicted in the movie. Nolte said that he is satisfied with the movie’s depictions of the environment as the director wanted to make the world in the film feel natural and real, a world before human civilization.
“A lot of Pixar films talk a lot. I think it is really cool that this one doesn’t during the first few moments” Nolte said.
Nolte explained that this would allow the audience to appreciate the vivid and realistic depiction of natural scenery in the movie.
This screening at USC is part of a promotional tour for the film that Walt Disney Studios and Pixar is sponsoring at several college campuses.
Nolte told the USC audience that he enjoyed being on tour showing his animations to different audiences.
“It’s been really fun to see the responses … it’s fun for me to see,” he said.
The Good Dinosaur is scheduled for release on Nov. 25.

University President C. L. Max Nikias announced last week that he will teach a course on government in Ancient Greece next semester, available only to freshman and sophomore students. Nikias gave the Daily Trojan an inside look at what’s to come in his course, “The Culture of the Athenian Democracy,” which he will teach alongside professor of classics Thomas Habinek.
A native of Cyprus and a graduate of the National Technical University of Athens, Nikias holds a deep connection with Greek literature and culture. He believes that understanding Athenian democracy’s influence on Western civilization is invaluable in students’ education.
Students who are interested in the course must submit an application, including two responses about the applicant’s interest in the course and former experience with  classics, by Nov. 6. Nikias also encourages students to consider a minor in the classics, for which his class in the spring will fulfill a requirement.
Daily Trojan: This is a topic that you’re very passionate about. What do you think your personal passion is going to bring to the classroom?
C. L. Max Nikias: I want to bring the passion and hopefully to spark the fire in the minds of the students. There is so much wisdom, timeless wisdom, in the classics. And this wisdom is so relevant to our everyday life today as citizens of the world. So this is what I really want to achieve with this class, and I feel honored and humbled that Professor Habinek agreed to co-teach the class with me, who, as you know, is a renowned classicist.
DT: What was the importance of just making the class available to freshman and sophomore students?
CLMN: We are only going to enroll 40 students, and that’s why we’re not inviting everyone to apply. Because of the limited size, this isn’t the type of class where we can accommodate 100 or 200. With Professor Habinek, we decided that we should restrict it for freshmen and sophomores. And hopefully we can excite kids in the classics so that they might seriously consider pursuing a minor in the classics, whatever their major might be.
DT: What do you think will be most impactful part of this course?
CLMN: We’re going to cover a period that history refers to as “The Golden Age of Athens.” And then in particular, I’m going to do the analysis of three tragedies, three masterpieces of Sophocles — Antigone, Oedipus the King and Philoctetes. Then, Professor Habinek — and we are going to interchange in the lectures — he is going to cover the Peloponnesian War, but also the events that surrounded those periods of time. So hopefully the students will try to get in the minds of the Athenian audience when these tragedies were staged for the first time. Antigone was staged in 442 B.C., Oedipus the King in 429 B.C. and Philoctetes in 409 B.C. So we’ll cover a long period of time in the Athenian democracy.
DT: What is important about studying this period of time?
CLMN: We basically study these people, we ask the question, “Who were these people?” They pretty much gave us the principles of democracy because that’s when democracy was practiced and introduced, invented and practiced. So who were these people that gave us the first democratic experiment in human civilization? These were the people who gave us the trial by jury, these were the people who gave us the separation of church and state, these were the people who gave us that military authority must always be under civilian control. Or the right of dissent and open criticism, without having the fear of being persecuted — so they give us free speech. That’s why we chose the particular period of time.
And, of course, theater was invented, in other words, theater as we know it today pretty much was born around the same time that democracy was born in Athens. So theater blossomed in parallel, together with this democratic experiment. And through these plays, these stories, these tragedies there are so many leadership lessons that could apply today. That’s what I want to emphasize in this class — what are the leadership lessons that we can extract as individuals from these three masterpieces of Sophocles?
DT: What types of students are you hoping to see?
CLMN: We want students from all disciplines to apply. Ideally, Professor Habinek and I would like to have a class that is very diverse in disciplines too. So we would like to have students from every professional school, whether it’s business or engineering or cinema or Annenberg and so on. And yes, we would also love to have students from the Dornsife College.
DT: What are you most looking forward to about getting back in the classroom?
CLMN: I feel that I’ve been missing that. I’ve been doing, for the last 10 years, micro-seminars where I do the analysis of Antigone over two days and a little bit of history of theater. I found that I enjoyed those micro-seminars very much, and the interaction with the freshman students. I think I have come to a point now, as president of the University, that it’s really worth going back to the classroom to co-teach a full course. It’s a lot of work, preparing for it, much more than just doing micro-seminars. But honestly, I am very excited. I am looking forward to it.

Nothing fishy here · Two Years Eight Months and Twenty-Eight Nights is author Salman Rushdie’s latest book. A play on Sheherezade’s One Thousand and One Nights, Rushdie explores different magical worlds. Though acclaimed, Rushdie has been embroiled in controversies. – Photo courtesy of Salman Rushdie
With midterms in full swing, and work and responsibility raining down on everyone’s heads, Salman Rushdie’s Two Years Eight Months and Twenty-Eight Nights provides some welcome magic and entertainment. This is the newest book by the controversial author, who has dealt with brutal critics. Rushdie has also been through a fatwa, an Islamic religious ruling, among other things, in response to his recent works. Nevertheless, he returns to his old brilliance with a dazzling epic of a novel.
I chose to read this book because the title, a play on the classic One Thousand And One Nights — the same amount of time as two years eight months and 28 days — was interesting to me. I’m a great fan of fairy tales and classic folk tales, so this modern retelling of Sheherezade’s enchanted stories seemed like it would be right up my alley. I wasn’t wrong. Rushdie has concocted a tale that is both grand yet intimate and sure to captivate readers.
The plot itself is too overwhelming to try to summarize, with not one but truly a thousand and one stories within the pages of each other. Each story springs from one another, miraculously intertwined and ranging across time and space. The story, on the whole, follows the intermingling of our world and the world of the jinns and jinnias. These are creatures of lust, magic and mischief who occasionally visit Earth through cracks in walls to play with the emotions of mankind or even take a male lover.
Such is the case with one such jinnia, referred to by many names including the Lightning Princess and Dunia. She meets and embarks on a relationship with an exiled philosopher, Ibn Rushd, who has been banned from his position in court for his writings supporting reason, logic and science, which are deemed to conflict with the ruling power’s doctrine of God’s complete power. During their romance, marriage and Dunia’s overwhelming number of pregnancies, Ibn Rushd placates his tempestuous wife with stories. It is, of course, worth remarking that Rushd bears an uncanny resemblance to Rushdie himself, as a highly criticized writer who relies on the art of storytelling. Eventually, Rushd leaves Dunia, unaware of her true mythical nature. In time, she retreats to her own world of magic, luxury and sexuality. This culminates in the closing of the gaps between the two worlds.
Then, hundreds of years later, in a time a little after our own, strange events happen in North America. An elderly gardener who relies on the use of reason and rejects all fantasy wakes up one morning and discovers that his feet do not touch the ground. This is only the beginning of a series of fantastical events — including tumultuous weather, a baby who can mark corrupt individuals with a single touch and a comic who encounters a strange apparition in his home — spanning, of course, two years, eight months and 28 nights. Evidently, the divide between our world and that of the jinn has been reopened.
The narrative is neither episodic nor continuous, but rather an intricate web of stories within larger stories, and stories that grow from other stories. What I loved about reading this book was its supernatural nature. I’ve always appreciated a little bit of wackiness in books as it makes me feel like I’m not just staring at a picture of my own world. I love the hilarious merging of the magical and the practical, as the levitating gardener contemplates every possibility but the mystical to explain why he leaves no footprints as he walks through the mud. I love the way that the story feels like a crazy whirlwind of characters and worlds — the reader has been thrown into the mix as well. There is also some truly gorgeous language, such as his description of “a girl of perhaps sixteen summers,” which truly sounds like the language of the original Arabian Nights, or his comical comparisons of New York City and Eden.
Still, beneath the comedy and artful manipulation of language, Rushdie is trying to tell us something more serious. The battle between the religious extremists and the men of science is not even thinly veiled. Rushdie alludes to the importance of not only logic and reason, but also of keeping an open mind to all things otherworldly. At the end of the day, this is a classic good-versus-evil story, but I can honestly say that I have never seen a story told like this before. Though the book has received some criticism for being too convoluted, I think the wildness of the plot and the multitudes of characters, places and events creates so much magic and beauty on the page that it is only a positive thing.
At the end of the day, I love magic. I also love innovative writing. I picked up this book because I thought it would provide a nice break from studying, but it ended up giving me so much more than that. Every time I opened the black and silver cover of my hardback copy, I found myself wholly engulfed into a world so different from my own, and yet so vivid and gorgeous. I almost wished I could stay in this make-believe world forever.

Top-selling American Idol winner and country singer Carrie Underwood is looking to return to the music industry with a bang. Her last album, Blown Away, was released in 2012 to critical acclaim, giving her more than enough time to create more hits. After giving birth to her first child with husband Mike Fisher in April, Underwood is ready to release her latest album this Friday — Storyteller.
“Smoke Break” is the standout single from the 13-song album. The single pays homage to hardworking people who just need a break, with the opening lines, “She’s a small-town,
hard-working woman just trying to make a living / Working three jobs, feeding four little mouths in a run-down kitchen.” Underwood’s vocals are breathtaking, and the lyrical content demonstrates so much depth. Many will be able to relate to this song.
“Renegade Runaway,” the opening track from the album, is a surprise hit, as Underwood’s vocals and the instrumentals are incredibly strong. It’s an Old Western storytelling song with a catchy beat. “Heartbeat,” on the other hand, is softer than the previous powerhouse songs; a strong welcome back to laidback country music. Underwood’s vocals have a strong country sound to them, but she is able to encapsulate a lullaby-esque sound. “What I Never Knew I Always Wanted” is a ballad that Underwood co-wrote with acclaimed songwriters Brett James and Hillary Lindsey about her husband and son. The lyrics are sweet and soulful, as Underwood speaks about singing lullabies to her son and loving his resemblance to his father, with lines such as, “I didn’t know there was a hole / Something missing in my soul / ‘Til you filled it up with your love.” “Like I’ll Never Love You Again” returns to that ’90s and early 2000s country jam that Tim McGraw and Faith Hill were able to perfect with their duets. This is a great love song, as well as another soft contribution to  the album.
However, one disappointment was some of the far-fetched tales in some of the songs. In “Mexico,” for instance, Underwood sings about telling her partner-in-crime to “look for the golden sombrero” and that if they get caught, they’ll get “25 to life.” Aside from the subtle deviations, Underwood’s tone is consistent but doesn’t carry enough edge to make the song feel believable.
Underwood has a great voice and is certainly one of the more memorable in country music in the last decade. In 10 years, she has been able to go from being a complete unknown country girl to one of the most powerful country singers of our time. That’s an incredible feat, and Underwood shows no signs of letting up with the fantastic album that is Storyteller. She is able to combine other people’s stories while remaining true to her country roots. Though some songs are inconsistent, the album generally feels put together and in place and is, without a doubt, one of Underwood’s stronger records. Underwood is able to achieve worldwide domination without necessarily trying to strive for it — she just does what she knows: show up, write amazing songs and perform them fantastically.

Matt Damon asked a good question in Good Will Hunting — “How about them apples?” As autumn’s freshest fruit, apples make for an excellent component of any dish, whether it be sweet or savory. Combining complementary flavors, these recipes can help students prepare for the colder weather. They might even keep the doctor away.
Apple Crisps
For a lighter take on America’s favorite dessert, the apple pie, try making an apple crisp. Though this dessert has origins in the Midwest, other fruits can be used in this recipe for a more tropical take. For example, switch out apples for mangoes or pineapples.
 
– 5 cups peeled, cored Gala apples
– 2 teaspoons white sugar
– ½ teaspoon ground cinnamon
– 1 ½ cups brown sugar
– ¾ cup all-purpose flour
– ½ cup softened butter
– 1 cup raisins (optional)
– 1 cup mixed spices (optional)
Serves 6. Active time: 15 minutes; Total: 1 hour.
Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Place apples in an ungreased baking dish and combine with sugar and cinnamon. Add raisins or mixed spices if desired. Mix together flour, brown sugar and softened butter in a large bowl, and place mixture over apples. Bake until mixture is lightly browned, around 45 to 60 minutes. Serve hot, with vanilla ice cream if desired.

Crispy Chicken and Apples Salad
Fried chicken might not be the healthiest option, but the Southern food is currently one of the most sought-out food trends, with many restaurants developing gourmet versions. Paired with apples and dried cranberries, the chicken is made more fall appropriate.
– ¼ cup all-purpose flour
– Salt and pepper, to taste
– 1 large egg
– 1 cup panko breadcrumbs
– 1 pound boneless, skinless chicken breast, slightly pounded to even thickness
– 2 tablespoons olive oil
– 1 large head of torn red-cabbage lettuce leaves
– 2 cups dried cranberries
– 2 apples, sliced thinly
Serves 4. Active time: 10 minutes; Total: 20 minutes.
Set up flour, egg and panko breadcrumbs in separate bowls for dredging stations. Whisk one tablespoon of water to egg. Add salt and pepper to panko breadcrumbs. Drench chicken in flour, shaking off excess. Then, place in egg, and finally, in breadcrumbs. In a pan, add olive oil. Fry chicken until done, patting off excess oil. Place lettuce on plate and sprinkle apples and cranberries. Add chicken and desired dressing.

Apple Chips
Unlike the previous recipe, apples can be a healthy snack by themselves. A better alternative to potato chips, apple chips are easy to make and do not require a fryer.
Simply core one apple, thinly sliced, and place onto an oiled baking sheet. Place into an oven set to 200 degrees for two to three hours until dry but still soft.
Apple Cheese Danish
No doubt, pastries are the perfect companion to a hot cup of tea, coffee or cocoa. Instead of waiting in long lines at Starbucks, prepare an Apple Cheese Danish fresh from the oven.
– 1 package cream cheese
– ¼ cup sugar
– 1 egg
– 1 teaspoon. vanilla extract
– ¼ teaspoon salt
– 2 medium Honeycrisp apples
– 1 teaspoon lemon juice
– 2 teaspoons sugar for apple mixture
– 1 sheet frozen puff pastry
Confectioner’s sugar, for sprinkling
Serves 6. Active time: 25 minutes; Total: 50 minutes.
Combine cream cheese, egg, vanilla extract and salt in a bowl. In a separate bowl, toss apples and lemon juice. Preheat oven to 400 degrees. Roll each pastry strip into squares and portion cream cheese mixture evenly among the squares. Top the pastries with apples. Fold the opposite corners of dough to meet in the middle. Put the pastries on greased pan. Bake for 20 to 25 minutes, or until golden.

Apple-Cheddar Waffle Panini
By now, it should be evident that apples are some of the most versatile fruits. For a different flavor, combine apples with cheese for a sharp contrast in taste. Mustard and maple syrup can also be added to this recipe for a more layered flavor.
– 4 frozen waffles
– 3 ounces grated cheddar cheese
– 1 apple, thinly sliced
– Vegetable oil
Serves 2. Active time: 10 minutes; Total: 20 minutes.
Layer the cheese and  the apple on a waffle. Stack another waffle on top. Lightly oil panini maker and place waffle sandwich. Cook until waffle is golden, turning after 5 minutes. If desired, cut panini in half.
Adapted from Country Living.
Roasted Applesauce
Sometimes, it’s best to return to basics. For an updated take on Gerber’s, this recipe features essential spices that accentuate the sweetness of the apples.
– ¼ cup water
– 6 tablespoons brown sugar
– 1 teaspoon lemon juice
– Pinch of salt
– 2 tablespoons unsalted butter, cubed
– 10 Fuji apples, cored and sliced
– ½ teaspoon ground cinnamon
– Pinch of nutmeg
Preheat oven to 425 degrees. Combine water, sugar, lemon juice and salt in a baking dish. Add butter cubes in mixture, topping with apples. Bake until apples are soft, 30 to 40 minutes. In batches, blend apples in food processor. Strain to sift out pieces. Heat over stovetop for warm applesauce.

In elementary and middle school, report cards were always effective in influencing student progression. Even then, however, complaints arose arguing that report cards weren’t accurate measures of determining development. But in a greater sense, that’s untrue. Report cards allow assessment of character highs and lows, specific areas for improvement and overall achievement. That’s why creating a report card for elected Los Angeles city officials is such a fitting idea. Recently, the Los Angeles Times graded the current mayor, city controller, city attorneys and council president, marking all with an overall average grade of C. Let’s take a closer look at this metric scale.
It seem’s like the L.A. Times’ overarching sentiment for Mayor Eric Garcetti hinges on the current mayor employing lots of talk and little action. As many politicians begin their campaign trail with promises for grandiose policies, Garcetti was no different in 2013 when he first ran and surely won’t be in 2017. I can’t blame him for setting his eyes on large policy changes, but I can blame him for failing to effectively execute these promises. And while I am understanding of the length of time necessary to make large changes, it’s lately becoming increasingly more evident that policy leaders are more interested in putting on the heroic facade and less interested in fixing problems. So while the L.A. Times endorsed Garcetti in 2013, they have now — instead of fully denouncing support for him — given him a C on his overall performance upon these five categories: a C- in leadership, C in effectiveness, B+ in vision, C+ in transparency and a D in political courage. Even I was shocked after I saw these scores.
Meanwhile, Garcetti is about halfway through his term as mayor and has been actively fundraising for his re-election campaign since March. Here’s what I’m seeing and can wholeheartedly agree with the Times for: There is a lack of comprehensive plans for education reform, job creation, homelessness and domestic abuse. But that’s not all of it. It begins here in South Central. Garcetti must take efficient measures to combat issues local to USC’s neighborhood.
In The Prince, Niccolo Machiavelli recommends that those who lead must appoint ministers who don’t already hold power. Perhaps Garcetti failed to realize that using political cronies is a mistake, especially when he promised to hire a deputy mayor of the economic and workforce development department. I’m cautiously optimistic in that I believe Garcetti has room for change in the less than two years left in his term, but the key word in this is “cautious.” I’m looking forward to educational reform which promotes funding for programs against gang violence resistance, charter schools and a lofty goal toward combatting low graduation rates. It’s possible for Garcetti to treat plans especially in the economic workforce for the Angelenos in South Central as he said he would during his campaign. Since Garcetti’s backdoor incident in which he snuck out the back door of his home when black rights’ protesters asked for answers, he has been coined as the figure who speaks only when it benefits him politically. The mayoral race is non-partisan, but never have I seen Garcetti work outside of his party. The Times editorial board said, “to be a leader, he has to be willing to make hard, unpopular decisions for the greater good of the city.” At best, Garcetti deserves a C+ for his term as mayor.
The Times’ offered Herb Wesson’s placement as council president average at best, noting that his work merely serves as a placeholder with a lack of willingness to discuss major issues at council meetings such as minimum wage increases and cuts in retirement benefits for city workers. Wesson’s portrayal suggests he plays ball as the captain of court with little room for negotiation. Quite clearly, Garcetti and Wesson are less fond of spending the city budget on restructuring of the streets — specifically the potholes and busted sidewalks. City planning that promotes integration, rather than political motivations, should be considered on his behalf and more issues need to be put on the table. City Attorney Mike Feuer received the best grade by far with a B+. According to the Times’, Feuer’s focus on the neighborhood prosecutor program where he helped pave the way for lower instances of neighborhood crime disputes and greater resolutions among low-level crimes.
Los Angeles politicians —step your game up.

In presenting its resolution on campus climate reform this past Tuesday, the Undergraduate Student Government provided a much-needed structural answer for overt racial discrimination present on campus. Moreover, the Daily Trojan editorial board is pleased to see that its recommendation to include a vice president for equity, diversity and inclusion is included in the resolution — which also presents definite, large-scale efforts to institute real change on this campus.
It is entirely frustrating, then, that the proposal’s call for transparency, accessibility and equity was answered by accusations of racial discrimination and condemnation for the negligent use of University funds. Opposition to the resolution, which has manifested in a Facebook event titled “Say No to Race Quotas and Tuition Hikes at USC,” has misconstrued the proposal’s goal to address diversity, cultural competency and underrepresentation at USC with a demand to institute racial quotas and unlawful increases in tuition at the expense of marginalized students. Despite the reductive and divisive rhetoric employed to tie down the effort, USG and allied campus organizations alike provide a comprehensive proposal that above all else establishes resources and equal opportunities for minority students. The opposition to the bill misrepresents the purpose, intention and practical result of the bill — blowing a minor point of the resolution out of proportion, misunderstanding its effect and echoing greater false narratives that have historically pitted communities of color against each other.
The most attention-grabbing claim of opponents to the resolution is that it will create, as the Facebook event claims, “a de facto racial quota system on our campus.” This is entirely untrue. The resolution calls for the creation of a “Vice President of Diversity, Equity and Inclusion to measure and analyze diversity, inclusion and equity within a year as well as publically report and significantly increase recruitment, enrollment/hiring/appointment, and retention of students, faculty, staff and trustees of underrepresented populations to reflect national demographics by 2025.” Such language advocates for a more thorough and inclusive application process to be put into place — it does not advocate for a racial quota system. The purpose is to address the systemic obstacles that make higher education inaccessible for people of certain races and religions, socioeconomic backgrounds and gender identities. Evidently, a more holistic admissions process does not serve to unfairly advantage or disadvantage any group.
And the event description, along with many opponents of the resolution, professes that a manufactured “racial quota” system would be “devastating” to the Asian American community because “Asians would be considered an over-represented minority on our campus, forcing the school to reject them.” Such an assertion paints the Asian American community with a single brushstroke as a model minority, ignoring the struggle of subgroups — for example, Native Hawaiians or Pacific Islander students, 52 percent of whom are below the poverty line in California, according to California Standards Test data. In short, despite the assertions of diversity opponents,  many of whom are not Asian Americans themselves, policies that support minorities support Asian Americans, as well. Instead, using Asian Americans as a wedge piece to stop policies that help minorities pits communities of color against each other, stalling progress for all.
Some opponents of the bill also operate under the ill-advised assumption that the proposal will lead to increased tuition rates. Yes, it will take funds to hire a vice president for diversity, equity and inclusion and an additional Title IX investigator to provide cultural centers for minority students and diversity training and to provide a $100 million fund for underrepresented students. But to allocate less than 2 percent of the University’s projected  $6 billion endowment campaign to support minority students is not unreasonable. Moreover, it is disingenuous to assert that providing resources for minority students will directly result in hikes in tuition.
It’s important to remember that USG does not have the power to enact this recommendation. The very nature of the language employed calls for the issues to be “further resolved,” which means that this is simply a draft for action. On Tuesday, it will be voted on by the Senate, and, if it passes, the resolution will be presented to the administration. Understandably, when dealing with the University administration, student organizations need to anticipate the push for compromise that will ensue from the administration if the proposal passes through Senate. At this stage, the administration will choose which policies it will consider, and it’s likely that they will choose very few of the recommendations. Negotiation between student government and the administration will determine which proposals are feasible. So to those doubtful about how the University will make the commitment to the resolution — that’s their problem.

As my first semester as a graduate student at USC heads toward its conclusion, the most fascinating comment I’ve encountered was stated at the beginning of the semester across the street from campus. It was stated casually, with a sense of underlying sadness by a staff member of the Neighborhood Academic Initiative. Simply put, she referred to being able to contact Gov. Jerry Brown to let him know how many beds would be required in our state prisons simply by examining test scores from local students in high school.
While the deterministic nature of this statement was immediately baffling, it piqued my interest in a subject that has thus far been the focus of much of my research this semester, and at its core can be identified as the school-to-prison pipeline. What exactly is this? Well, it is a social phenomena based on the relationship between how our primary education often predisposes children in low-income neighborhoods to entering the correctional system. How does this occur? Well, the answer to this question is complex and, naturally, remains a subject of contention. At its core though, lies an examination of the correlation referred to by the staff member of NAI, the manner in which subjects around education have been informed by correctional facilities, and how tone-deaf administrative policy around marginalized students lends itself to underperformance and the spike in drop-out rates that we have seen in low-income high schools across the country.
In the wake of many rural and suburban campus shootings, it is remarkable that security measures around search and seizures and routine friskings have seen dramatic spikes on urban campuses in which this phenomena has not regularly occurred. However, these policies treat students as prisoners in their own education experiences, grooming the normative nature of these experiences during important formative years. It is also proven that zero tolerance policies around petty academic offenses such as cell phone use, dress code violations and truancy disparately impact low-income students, for whom nuanced family responsibilities and ties make adherence to such policies more difficult. Moreover, the correlation discussed by that staff member has all but been documented by social scientists who have examined the relationship between male underperformance in school and propensity toward criminal behavior. If we are treating people as criminals before they are criminals, then how are we as a society surprised when they grow up to behave in that manner?
This subject is of great importance to this generation of students, as we not only face record incarceration rates, but also drop-out rates in L.A. Unified School District that continue to rise dangerously close to 50 percent. The implications of this relationship can only benefit the dialogue we have around the importance of education as not just a goal of a just society, but also a deterrent to the teeming prison cells that are a burden on our state.  While this may have been news to me, unless further discussion is had about this, it will continue to be the source of news for a new generation of students entering the education system this year.

On Oct. 8, Sen. Dick Durbin of Illinois introduced the Affordable College Textbook Act to the U.S. Senate. This act aims to “pressure the traditional college textbook market to come up with cheaper alternatives and innovations,” according to Sen. Durbin in the Chicago Tribune. Though the bill has been referred to the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee, no further action has been taken in the past two weeks. In 2013, a similar bill was introduced to the Senate by Durbin, but it never made it out of committee and on to the floor of the Senate. Unfortunately, even if this iteration of the bill manages to make it through committee, it still faces an increasingly Republican House of Representatives reluctant to increase social program spending. These national trends, however, shouldn’t stop USC from considering taking some initiatives of its own on campus.
Even without federal or state funding, USC should work with textbook publishers to make resources more accessible to students. Online-only resources, educational commons or even access accounts for USC students on publisher websites could make the difference for students caught in a financial pinch. Libraries should work with departments to standardize textbook use. Libraries could then purchase extra copies of textbooks and loan them to students at no charge. Additionally, departments should consider using older editions of textbooks, which often sell for considerably less than their more recent counterparts and, in many cases, have much of the same information.
According to the College Board, textbooks and supplies cost college students about $1,200 annually. Another article published by The Economist last year reports that “the nominal price of textbooks has risen more than fifteenfold since 1970, three times the rate of inflation.” College textbooks are evidently highly expensive, and many students wish they were cheaper or even free. Sen. Durbin’s bill would put more pressure on the college textbook market to create viable, cheaper alternatives to the bricks of paper worth hundreds of dollars that students currently carry around campus. If textbooks, or key textbook materials, could be made accessible online at no cost to students through federal, state or institutional funding, then a great financial and literal weight will be lifted from their shoulders.
For many students, simply paying tuition is hard enough. Thankfully, not every class requires a textbook, and many professors are using online sources of distribution such as Blackboard and ARES to reduce dependency on textbooks. Though these initiatives and book rentals from the USC Bookstore lower costs for students, the prices of the books themselves is still very high. One must look no further than the top floor of the bookstore to get a feeling of just how much some textbooks cost. ECON 317, for example, requires that students purchase Statistics for Business and Economics, a book that that the bookstore prices at $319 for a new edition. And PHYS 135A, a prerequisite class for four majors, requires that students purchase Physics: Principles with Applications, which goes for $233.75 new.
These books and many others are required by classes, and the most reliable source of new and used textbooks on campus is the USC Bookstore, which cycles proceeds from purchases back into the University. However, the prices at the bookstore are excessive. This steers students away from purchasing their materials through USC. Savvy students can find better deals on used and new books online, but this doesn’t keep student funds within USC. In order to keep money on campus, USC has to do a better job of being competitive in earning its students’ money. Slashing prices on books and offering other materials at low cost will accomplish that objective.
Even if USC makes less money per book, keeping the USC Bookstore’s prices competitive draws in more students, keeps money circulating within USC and helps the Trojan Family as a whole. Lowering student dependence on costly textbooks will free up student financial resources for other academic, professional and recreational pursuits. Financial barriers associated with textbook costs shouldn’t prevent good students from being successful. USC ought to invest in its best and brightest, even if those students do not have the income necessary to afford to purchase their books.

Packaged in colorful little bottles plastered with claims of “scientifically proven” benefits, dietary supplements are flying off the shelves and into the stomachs of health-conscious Americans. Replacing their dubious predecessors of magic weight loss pills and miraculous appetite suppressants, dietary supplements like vitamins and mineral pills have been welcomed as a more scientific and trustworthy “fast food” approach to health.
A stop at the local Vitamin Shoppe in my hometown revealed that now, there truly is a pill for everything from muscle building to memory improvement. For college students, the idea of taking a pill to achieve a healthier lifestyle seems appealing, especially when our schedule gets chaotic and eating right is not a priority. A study published last week in the New England Journal of Medicine, however, uncovers how millennials’ supplement obsession is impacting health.
Citing data from 63 emergency departments in the US, the probe revealed that more than 23,000 ER visits were due to dietary supplement usage — 28 percent of which involved adults 20 to 34 years old. Most of the visits were more specifically attributed to “herbal or complementary nutritional products” for dieting and energy. Of the many severe side effects reported, chest pain, high heart rate and irregular heartbeat were the most common for college-aged patients.
Yet, once you look at the Food and Drug Administration’s supplement approval processes, these findings are hardly surprising. Supplement companies do not have to ensure that their products are effective or even safe. The FDA monitors the dietary supplement market by the sole means of recall — only if the supplements are proven to be unsafe, after they are already on the shelves, can they be regulated and removed.
Though there might be a small minority of college students that use vitamins and mineral supplements, energy-boosting pills are definitely popular on campus. The long list of energy supplements, caffeine pills, guarana, ginseng, Vitamin B12 and Coenzyme Q10 parallels their popularity. A study from Northwestern University found that of caffeine supplement abuse cases, the average age of patients was 21. Dietary supplements are increasingly becoming an issue on college campuses –– students turn to them in desperate times as “study aids,” but there are a few natural and much safer alternatives for students finding themselves in a bind:
Now this might seem obvious, but it is far easier to abuse caffeine, which is technically a drug, if you take a pill versus waiting in line at TroGro. Also, caffeine pills are highly concentrated. Magnum 357 Caffeine tablets have 200 milligrams of caffeine in each pill, which is at the tail end of the safe range of caffeine consumption per day. Take two or three, and depending on your body weight, you could overdose on caffeine.
Your body is built to absorb vitamins and minerals from food, not chemically synthesized pills. Though not all the evidence is in yet on the effectiveness of dietary supplements, marginally overdosing on Vitamin A and Retinol has been proven to cause a multitude of negative side effects. 
If you feel the need to take a vitamin or mineral supplement to make up for deficiencies in your diet for example, talk to a doctor first. Make use of your student health fees and stop by Engemann to get a second opinion and ensure that the brand of supplements you want to take is effective and safe.
Dietary supplements can complement a balanced diet, but till the effects of nutrition pills are truly understood, it might be best to err on the side of caution, and stick to safer alternatives.

Boy, you know it’s a slow week in college football when College GameDay is at James Madison instead of an FBS school. But predicting games can make any mundane week of matchups fun. Besides, after last weekend I think everyone’s hearts could use a break, especially Michigan fans. But oh man, what a time to be alive. The Associated Press Top 25 now has four non-power conference schools (Memphis, Toledo, Houston and Temple), along with teams such as Pittsburgh and Duke that are known more for their basketball teams than anything else.  Even with just a handful of ranked matchups this week, there’s still plenty of mystery games for us to talk about.
No. 15 Texas A&M at No. 24 Mississippi (Spread: -17)
This matchup should be known as the “regroup” game. Last weekend, Ole Miss had a surprising loss against Memphis, while Texas A&M was on the receiving end of a ’Bama beatdown.
The Rebels will get back their excellent left tackle, Laremy Tunsil, who has missed the first seven weeks of the season due to an NCAA investigation. Despite this, the Rebels will have other defensive holes with defensive tackle Robert Nkemdiche out due to concussion protocol and center Robert Conyers out with a torn ACL.
While the Rebels’ defense is looking rather thin, Aggies quarterback Kyle Allen’s three pick-sixes against the Tide last week show that Texas A&M’s quarterback situation isn’t looking too hot either. Our model has Mississippi as 17-point favorite but the personnel issues for both teams means this game could easily be much closer.
Tennessee at No. 8 Alabama (Spread: -18.5)
While the rivalry between these two teams isn’t what it has been, Tennessee is looking to keep the momentum going after their upset of Georgia before their bye week. Alabama has won the past eight meetings with Tennessee quite handily. Last year, however, was a different story. Tennessee cut an early 27-0 deficit to to 27-17. The Vols still eventually lost 34-20 but with Quarterback Joshua Dobbs back at the helm, Tennessee will be looking to keep this game close. For this to happen, Dobbs will need to have another good game and lead the Vols defense against a tough ’Bama defense.
No. 6 Clemson at Miami (Florida) (Spread: -17)
This matchup is the first of two straight road games for Clemson before a possible showdown of undefeated teams against Florida State. But focusing on this weekend, Clemson at Miami features one of the best quarterback matchups of the week and possibly the season. Quarterbacks Deshaun Watson (Clemson) and Brad Kaaya (Miami) both started as freshmen last season and have steadily improved since then. This season Watson has thrown 235 yards per game, 14 touchdowns and 7 interceptions. While impressive, the number of interceptions is a potential source of concern for Clemson fans, especially against a Miami offense led by Kaaya. Kaaya has proven that he will be a top choice in the 2016 NFL draft with 300 yards per game, 10 touchdowns and only one interception on the season. The main problem for Miami is that Watson, unlike Kaaya, has the backing of a well-rounded team that, according to S&P+ ratings, has a top-25 run offense, a top-10 pass defense, a top-five pass offense and the best run defense in the league.
Now this is where things get weird. Our model has Miami as a two-touchdown favorite. I know what you’re thinking and trust me, we’re quite confused too. The best explanation is that our model overemphasizes turnover margins. Miami’s 2.17 per game turnover margin compared to Clemson’s -0.17 per game turnover margin causes our model to favor Miami, despite the wealth of evidence suggesting otherwise.
Texas Tech at No. 17 Oklahoma (Spread: -15)
Man, this will be an interesting one. Yes, I say that a lot, but this matchup, in particular, is going to be interesting because of the varied performances of both teams each week. The same Texas Tech team that nearly upset Texas Christian struggled to beat Kansas 30-20 last week. Meanwhile, the Sooners put up 55 points in their shutout of Kansas State after getting rocked by Texas.
Both of these teams performances’ have varied from week to week but what’s clear is both teams have high-powered offenses and the scoreboard operator better be ready for an eventful Saturday.
No. 3 Utah at Southern California (Spread: -11)
I know what you’re thinking, “USC is favored?!” You know what’s crazier? Vegas has us as a favorite (OK, only three points, but better than nothing). And it should go without saying — the folks in Vegas usually know what they’re doing when it comes to college football.
So what’s the deal then? First, we’ve had quite a few close losses (the Stanford, Washington, and Notre Dame scoring margins were all within 10 points). As surprising as this may sound, scoring margin is a pretty good predictor of future performance, sometimes even better than a team’s win-loss record. USC and Utah have the same scoring margin (+17 points per game). True, the Trojans have an interim coach, but we also have a lot of talent on offense. The deciding factor will be whether or not USC’s offense will be able to stay on the field and make enough big plays against Utah’s tough defense.
Utah has proven itself on the road twice against Fresno State and Oregon. And the Utes have beaten Michigan and Cal. So there’s no doubt that Utah has a great defense and an impressive resume of wins this season. And it’s quite possible that USC simply looks better on paper, but trying to guess the outcome is what makes college football so much fun.
And if we do lose, at least we know the experts in Vegas still believe in us.

Students and faculty gathered at the Davidson Conference Center Wednesday afternoon to celebrate the rededication of the center as the new home of the USC International Academy.
The USC International Academy prepares international high school students for college and international USC students applying for master’s programs. This program was launched in 2014, and this fall, approximately 700 students are enrolled across all three programs: English, undergraduate preparation and master’s preparation.
“We equip them fully for university life,” said Deborah Detzel, academic director of the Language Academy, in her speech at the event. “With courses like ‘Exploring Your Major’ and ‘University Communication and Culture,’ we prepare our students to enter degree programs ahead of the learning curve in an academic culture far different from their own.”

University President C. L. Max Nikias and Anthony Bailey, vice president of strategic and global initiatives also spoke at the event following a video that described the International Academy and depicted the firsthand experiences of students in the program.
“We celebrate a landmark moment in our University’s continued push to stand at the forefront as a global, American research university,” Nikias said. “We also acknowledge that we are building on an already very rich history. An international character that runs so deep that it defines our very DNA as a University.”
The Spirit of Troy also accompanied the event speakers, playing at the beginning and the end of the event.
After the speaking portion of the program concluded, students and faculty in the International Academy were invited into the Davidson Center for appetizers and tours of the new classrooms.
This newly renovated space, which was used for large conferences prior to the rededication, now features 28 classrooms, advising spaces and offices.
Xi Cheng, an electrical engineering student, is looking forward to starting her master’s degree this spring through classes offered at the International Academy.

“I want to continue studying this major,” Cheng said.  “[The International Academy] will allow me more opportunities in the future.”
Bailey believes that by replicating an American study environment, students like Cheng will be successful.
“The USC International Academy is designed to help students to really be successful in a U.S.-style classroom and to be acclimated to university life in the U.S.,” Bailey said.  “Students who want to get their English up are getting test preparation and attending admissions consulting for admissions — so we help them with how to navigate the U.S. admissions process to gain admission into U.S. universities.”
While those enrolled in the English, test preparation and admission classes constitute a large majority of the student body, the biggest program is the Pre-Master’s Program.
“The whole idea behind the Pre-Master’s program is that there are a lot of really well academically qualified students who had really good grades in national universities, but don’t have the English level yet to get into a USC program,” Bailey said. “So what we will do is for the master’s programs that are participating at USC, academy students will apply to that program and they will gain conditional admission in that program [predicated] on the student taking a semester or two in the academy.”
USC is unique among private universities for spearheading this program, which aims to acclimate students to the typical classroom and culture found at the respective institution while at the same time adding to the mélange of current international and national students.
“This is the first time that a top research university has created a program of such singular depth and scope,” Nikias said.

Burying the hatchet · The USC Song Girls, UCLA Spirit Girls and mascots Traveler and Joe Bruin participate in the rally Wednesday. – Mariya Dondonyan | Daily Trojan
In spite of the schools’ longstanding sports rivalry, representatives from USC and UCLA came together Wednesday afternoon to support the second annual Rivals United for a Kure Rally. The event, hosted by the Irvine-based nonprofit Kure It Cancer Research, aimed to raise awareness and funds for cancer research at the UCLA Jonsson and USC Norris Comprehensive Cancer Centers.
The rally, which took place in Downtown’s City National Plaza, kicked off with a performance from the Spirit of Troy marching band accompanied by the USC Song Girls, followed by the Bruin Marching Band and Spirit Girls. Both schools’ mascots — Traveler and Joe Bruin — made an appearance and offered photo ops for attendees. Throughout the event, guests could enjoy free food giveaways and purchase raffle tickets or “Cancer Sucks” t-shirts, the profits from which would be donated to Kure It.
According to studies by the National Cancer Institute, one in two men and one in three women will be diagnosed with a form of cancer each year.
Kristen Rhynerson, associate director for Cancer Research at Kure It, said that because cancer is so common, more people should be invested in searching for a cure.
“Cancer is a disease that affects us all,” Rhynerson said in an email to the Daily Trojan. “We hope that students will unite with the greater Los Angeles community as Trojans and Rivals United.”
According to USC alumnus and former Cleveland Browns starting quarterback Paul McDonald, Kure It chose to hold the rally at the City National Plaza due to its prime location for students and alumni of both schools, as well as professionals working in the area. McDonald said that the organization owed much to its sponsor, City National Bank.
“We wanted to bring [guests] Downtown — that’s why we’re here at this unbelievable plaza,” McDonald said. “City National Bank … has been incredible for us each and every year.”
Students such as Max Rorsted, a sophomore majoring in economics and political science, helped make the event possible by working the sales booths as volunteers. Rorsted, a member of the Phi Kappa Psi fraternity, said that his fraternity decided to volunteer in order to show that any sports rivalry is overshadowed by the need to work toward a cure for cancer.
“A lot of us have lost friends or family members — for example, my grandmother passed away from cancer,” Rorsted said. “It’s something that each of us has a chance to make an actual difference in once we put in some effort. Since it affects every one of us personally, we are bound to make a contribution to the community and just put our work and effort in to make a better society.”
Rivals United aims to raise $500,000 by the end of the year, which is part of a larger $1 million goal that the organization hopes to meet within two years. Since 2012, Rivals United has raised more than $1.1 million for cancer research, and hosts multiple fundraisers at both USC and UCLA sporting events. Most prominently, representatives from Rivals United will be on campus at the Conquest concert and rally before the USC-UCLA football game in November.
Kure It was founded by USC alumnus Barry Hoeven after he was diagnosed with kidney cancer in 1998, an event that inspired him to reach out to others afflicted with cancer and raise both funds and awareness for the cause. In 2007, Hoeven partnered with City of Hope to raise $400,000 for a cancer research fund, which became a nonprofit in 2010. In founding Kure It, Hoeven aspired to create a nonprofit that was able to raise money for vital and collaborative cancer research, which is why Rivals United aims to bring USC and UCLA together in seeking a cure.
