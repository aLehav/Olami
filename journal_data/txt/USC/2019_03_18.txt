The No. 1 women’s water polo team continued its winning streak with a decisive 12-8 victory over No. 5 Hawaii Saturday at the Duke Kahanamoka Aquatic Center in Honolulu. With this victory, USC improved to a 20-0 record for the season. 
Junior utility Maud Megens had 5 goals to lead the Trojans offensively, while senior goalie Amanda Longan manned the cage with nine saves.
Although the Rainbow Wahine scored the first point of the game, the Trojans fired back quickly with 3 consecutive points from sophomore driver Paige Hauschild and freshman driver Grace Tehaney to set the tone for the rest of the match. After Hawaii scored another goal, USC went on to net 7 straight points, 5 of which came from Megens, to set the score at 10-2 with 2:28 left in the third period. The Rainbow Wahine made a comeback with 4 goals in the fourth period, but it was too little, too late for the team to outscore the Trojans. 
“I think toward the end of the game — and I think this comes with all athletic sports — when you have a big comfortable lead, obviously your focus kind of drops a bit, and you’re kind of on cruise control and that just comes down to discipline,” interim head coach Casey Moon said. “Do you fault the girls? No, but we’ve got to minimize that fault and prepare for future games to come.”
Moon said the team had to take Hawaii seriously, especially in an unfriendly setting.
“We’ve been preparing for them for the past week as well as when we were back at ’SC,” Moon said. “Hawaii is a dangerous team playing here at home, they’ve had some close games with a lot of other big [Mountain Pacific Sports Federation] schools.”
The Trojans had to shut down two of Hawaii’s best players, senior attacker Irene Gonzalez and junior center Elyse Lemay-Lavoie. They did their best to deny those two players the ball with swarming double teams. 
“We had to focus on our defensive end to make sure our matchups were set to minimize them touching the ball,” Moon said.
Gonzalez and Lemay-Lavoie had 3 and 2 goals, respectively, to lead the Rainbow Wahines in scoring, while freshman goalie Bridget Layburn logged eight saves in the net.
The Trojans pulled out this win amid controversy involving the team’s recruitment efforts. Former head coach Jovan Vavic was arrested by the FBI around 6:30 a.m. on March 12, when the team was already in Hawaii for the match. Vavic — who was indicted for his involvement in the “Operation Varsity Blues” college admissions scandal — was fired by USC that afternoon.
Despite the turmoil, the Trojans entered the match with high energy.
“The excitement that we had starting the game was great,” Moon said. “I think that excitement kind of comes from our two senior leaders who are our captains, Amanda Longan and [driver] Courtney Fahey. They know what we’re about, they know what this program stands for. While we were here, it’s been a great opportunity for [the team] to bond and yes, water polo is just a game, but it’s an opportunity for them to bond and truly play for one another and enjoy doing it.”
With an undefeated record well into the season, and not having lost to Hawaii since 2006, Moon said the leadership of veteran team members kept the Trojans from growing complacent. 
“It comes from our leaders, the girls who have been with this program and understand what we’re about and that for us, these games are important, but these are just games to help us for the big picture,” Moon said.
Moon said he believes the Trojans can achieve their ultimate goal of winning back-to-back national championships, something the team has never done before. 
“I think we have a special group of girls here to be able to make it happen,” he said.
USC returns home to host Stanford at 2 p.m. March 30 at Uytengsu Aquatics Center. The game will be broadcasted on the Pac-12 Network.

USC is no stranger to scandals and controversy, and its athletics department is not immune. The illegal benefits case surrounding former running back Reggie Bush, which also applied to basketball player O.J. Mayo, is perhaps the most well-known college athletics scandal of this century. Last year, then-assistant coach Tony Bland was one of a few college basketball coaches named in a FBI probe that found recruits were paid under the table to choose certain universities. USC is even related, albeit indirectly, to one of the most famous court cases of all time, involving former running back O.J. Simpson.
Now, the department is facing more scrutiny as part of  a nationwide FBI investigation into bribery in college admissions. The big name involved is men’s and women’s water polo coach Jovan Vavic, who was arrested last week for helping students get admitted into USC as recruits without even having played the sport. Other members of the department were also implicated for the same reasons, including senior associate athletic director Donna Heinel, who was taken into custody. 
This marks a low point for USC Athletics; in the last few months, the once-hallowed department has taken multiple big hits to its reputation. After a disappointing football season, Athletic Director Lynn Swann decided to retain maligned head coach Clay Helton while firing a fair amount of the rest of the coaching staff. Swann then brought the University more embarrassment by bungling the Kliff Kingsbury signing. Kingsbury was hired as offensive coordinator for about a month before he used his tiny buyout to scorn the Trojans for the Arizona Cardinals head coaching gig.
Things only got worse as the men’s basketball season continued. Despite a promising recruiting class and returning productive starters in forwards senior Bennie Boatwright and junior Nick Rakocevic, the Trojans floundered to a 16-17 season marked by inconsistency and dysfunction. This included Swann’s puzzling decision to remove the Song Girls from basketball games, which became controversial due to a lack of logic or explanation. 
The reason this latest scandal represents the department’s low point — until it screws up again, anyway — is the dismal state of its teams’ performance. It would lessen the blow if the department at least had good results to point to, but there are no positives to find when the organization is corrupt and still can’t produce winning teams. Like it or not, winning covers up a lot of moral and legal concerns for fans and executives alike. Do you think any USC fans would trade the excitement and success of the Bush era to escape the embarrassment of what followed? Maybe some would, but those teams carry so many fond memories for fans that it seems doubtful that many of them would rather it never happened.
Therein lies the power of winning, and USC lacks that advantage right now. Its secondary teams have been proficient (although water polo is now embroiled in this scandal), but the major teams are well below average. The football team, one of the sport’s traditional blue bloods, is in a performance and reputation crisis. The basketball team, which struggles to attract attention even when it’s good, has been unable to capitalize on its strong recruiting numbers. The baseball team, which has won twice as many championships as any other school, has one College World Series appearance under the current leadership and hasn’t seriously contended since 2001.
That’s not to say any of the University’s teams is more important than the others, but, in terms of the athletic department’s reputation and the discourse around it, the perception of these three teams (and specifically the football team) are bigger factors than the others. Whatever the states of those teams are will decide much of how fans and the media view the department, and right now, those three are struggling mightily. Those failures make it so much harder to rebound from humiliating scandals. It’s not morally right that team success can make up for corruption, but USC Athletics’ lack of integrity both on and off the field does explain why the program is at an all-time low.
Much like many of its teams, USC Athletics is at a crucial crossroads. Swann and his staff need to start making positive steps because it could still get worse if more corruption is revealed. Until the teams improve, Swann needs to make up ground by tightening up his department and preventing further corruption. USC teams need wins between the lines, but perhaps more important is the department avoiding losses off the field.

The Trojans claimed two road victories in their weekend series against Cal to improve their overall record to 7-11 on the season. Prior to its series against the Golden Bears, USC had lost four of its last five games.
This was the first weekend series against a Pac-12 opponent for the Trojans. The Pac-12 is recognized as one of the toughest conferences in college baseball, so it was important for the Trojans to start off Pac-12 play in a positive fashion.
The Trojans kicked off the series with a 9-4 victory over the Golden Bears on Friday.
They were first to put runs on the board, scoring 3 unearned runs in the top of the third inning. However, the Golden Bears retaliated right away with 4 runs in the bottom of the third.
But the Trojans would not allow the Golden Bears anymore runs in the game. In the top of the sixth inning, redshirt junior catcher CJ Stubbs tied the game up at 4 runs apiece with a solo home run to left field.
Shortly after, in the eighth inning, sophomore right fielder Jamal O’Guinn hit a 2-run home run, bringing the score up to 6-4. USC went on to pick up 3 more runs in the ninth inning to finish the game 9-4.
“We haven’t started off the way we wanted to, not too hot,” O’Guinn said in an interview on Twitter after the game. “When we’ve been up, we haven’t been able to keep the leads and stuff. So tonight was a good … [way] to show how good our offense really is.”
In his first start of the season, junior pitcher Connor Lunn claimed the victory in Friday’s series opener. Typically, Lunn is used in relief to finish games off, but head coach Dan Hubbs opted to change his role for this game. In his seven innings on the mound, Lunn struck out six batters and allowed 4 runs.
The Trojans were able to win the second game of the series despite only scoring 1 run. Sophomore pitcher Isaac Esqueda emerged as the X-factor in Saturday’s game, pitching six scoreless innings to make up for the gap in the team’s offense. 
“I thought Isaac was really the story of the game,” Hubbs said. “He just pitched with a lot of heart and got them to hit with some poor contact. I thought we made some more plays behind him. I just can’t say enough of what he did.”
In the third inning, the Trojans scored their only run of the game after junior left fielder Blake Sabol hit a sacrifice fly to left field to score sophomore third baseman Ben Ramirez.
The Trojans lost 9-8 in the final game of the series Sunday despite a late comeback in the ninth inning.
The Trojans fell behind 6-1 in the sixth inning, as the Golden Bears scored 4 runs in the frame. While USC followed up in the seventh by scoring 3 runs of its own, the Golden Bears countered by scoring 3 more runs in the bottom of the seventh to make the scoreline 9-4 and seemingly put the game out of reach. 
The Trojans scored 4 runs in the ninth inning. O’Guinn started the rally by connecting on another home run in the series, and the Trojans batted through the lineup, forcing Cal to change pitchers. However, it proved to be too little, too late for the Trojans, and the Golden Bears took the game on a flyout in O’Guinn’s second at-bat of the inning.
USC is now four games below .500 on the year, and the competition will only get tougher as they prepare to face multiple Pac-12 opponents in the coming weeks.
In its next game, USC will host Long Beach State Tuesday. On paper, this game looks to be one that the Trojans should win; the Dirtbags hold a dismal 3-15 record on the year. In recent years, however, Long Beach State has been a tough opponent for the Trojans. The two teams split their two series last year, with each team winning on the road.
After their game against Long Beach State, the Trojans will prepare for another Pac-12 matchup on the road with a trip to Washington over the weekend looming.

Following last Tuesday’s exposure of an alleged college admissions bribery scheme in which parents allegedly paid to have their children falsely admitted as student athletes at USC and other universities, the University has terminated senior associate athletic director Donna Heinel and water polo head coach Jovan Vavic. Both Heinel and Vavic worked for USC Athletics for over a decade.
Athletic Director Lynn Swann, who denies having had any knowledge of the alleged illegal activity taking place within the department, has insisted he will not be stepping down from his job. Some have called for Swann’s resignation and firing for allegedly allowing such bribery and high-scale corruption to take place under his watch.
“I think everybody was blindsided by this,” Swann told the Los Angeles Times Friday. “[Heinel and Vavic] are people that have been here a long time, and people who had been here during difficult times and had seen bad things done and knew better.” 
Swann said that the alleged illicit behavior in his department went unnoticed due to faults in the system athletics officials used to correspond with the admissions office. 
Heinel was the sole person in charge of submitting athletes’ academic records to USC’s Office of Admissions and subsequently returning admission information to coaches. Because her power went unchecked, Heinel could add the names of fake athletes to a list given to her by a particular coach, and remove that name before returning correspondence to the coach after it was sent to admissions the FBI investigation alleged. 
“When there’s trust that this one person is doing the right thing, which [Heinel] had been doing for years, there’s not a problem,” Swann told the Times. “We will work with the administration, admissions, sports administrators, recruiters and scouts so there are more eyeballs on this.”
Vavic had worked with the women’s water polo program since it was established in 1995. The men’s and women’s teams won a combined 16 national championships under his leadership.
Along with cooperating with the government’s investigation, the University said it will be implementing new procedures to ensure that such a scam does not occur again. In the athletics department multiple administrators will be in charge of athlete admission information going forward.
Swann declined to comment on the admissions scheme. Interim women’s water polo coach Casey Moon also did not comment on the investigation.

Conan Gray isn’t in Texas anymore. From establishing a YouTube channel with over 1.1 million subscribers to performing sold-out shows across the country, the 20-year-old songwriter from Georgetown, Texas sticks to his humble roots through music. After signing with Republic Records, Gray moved from his small town to Los Angeles in 2017 to attend his dream school, UCLA, and pursue his musical career. With dreamy tracks like “Crush Culture” and “Generation Why,” Gray has been on tour nonstop since the release of his debut EP “Sunset Season” last winter, and he even opened for Panic! At the Disco shows in February.
While getting ready for L.A. rehearsals one Friday morning, the artist chatted with the Daily Trojan to discuss how he’s balancing music, YouTube, friends and everything else life throws at him.
Though Gray is currently on leave from UCLA for his tour, when asked about whether he bought into the USC-UCLA rivalry, his loyalty to the Bruins was clear.
“Oh yeah. I hate you guys,” Gray chuckled. “One of my best friends goes to USC, so I’ve actually been spending a decent amount of time on your campus. I’ll give it to you, you guys have a really pretty campus, and the [USC] Village looks like Hogwarts.”
Gray said building his musical career while at UCLA was like his “Hannah Montana” moment — taking classes during the day and pursuing music outside of school.
“I feel like now, it’s super special because I get to actually hug the people I’ve seen on my phone for so long,” Gray said. “I actually get to sing and see these people face-to-face, and it feels so much more rewarding and so much more intimate than making videos on the internet, so it’s just been really, really nice.”
Though promoting his EP is currently a priority, Gray dedicates time in his day to engage with fans on Twitter and YouTube, two platforms he credits his success to. Die-hard fans know there’s a distinct difference between his personalities on the two platforms, which Gray explained reflect what it’s like getting to know him in real life.
“All of my friends who are really close to me know that Twitter Conan is the real Conan, and YouTube Conan is like the acquaintance Conan, the person that you meet on the street and will hug you and be very, very nice,” Gray said. “Twitter Conan is just like angry, angsty, very shy and introverted. It’s just really who I am.”
Gray noted that moving around a lot while growing up and living in a small town played a crucial role in shaping his identity and, ultimately, his music. Even though he is currently living in Los Angeles and touring the country, Gray finds ways to stay connected to his hometown in order to stay in touch with his Southern roots.
“I FaceTime my best friend from back home, Ashley, every single day,” Gray said. “It’s pretty hard to forget my hometown when I’m talking to her constantly,” Gray said. “And I think I’ll always be a small town kid no matter what. I think there’s just something about being from the South and also just being from a place where nothing ever changes, and it really does impact your youth, and I think I’ll never really be able to forget that small town mentality and the slower-paced life that’s back there.”
Currently, Gray is living a fast-paced life, performing two sold-out shows at the El Rey theatre in Los Angeles on March 14 and 15. The singer, however, is relishing doing what he loves. 
“Songwriting is the love of my life,” Gray said. “I can’t wait to be making music for as long as I can.”

When I was newly admitted to USC over two years ago, I, like many of my peers, was eager to get my hands on all the information I could find about the upcoming years at my dream school. Once I exhausted the school’s website and College Confidential, I turned to a much more honest form of content that came directly from the students: memes.
Defining what exactly constitutes an internet meme can be a little tricky, but it is essentially a phrase, graphic or idea that comically conveys a societal phenomenon through cultural references. Importantly, memes are highly shareable, relatable and reduce the complexities of the human condition into a simple punchline — most of the time, they don’t have to even make sense.
Realistically, almost anything can become a meme if it accurately captures the cultural moment, which is why they spread like wildfire and have such large-scale impact in the internet age.
The term “meme” was coined in 1976 by British evolutionary biologist Richard Dawkins, who wrote that memes were the cultural parallel to genes, as both exist to transmit information and replicate themselves. With modern technology factored in, memes became an integral part of internet culture. 
My 17-year-old self started scrolling through the “USC Memes for Spoiled Pre-Teens” Facebook group. The flawless, shiny facade USC donned throughout information sessions and campus tours faded to reveal aspects of USC’s culture that would be difficult to derive at face value. For a while, the memes mostly featured common college experiences with a Trojan twist: EVK jokes, Greek life, “University of Spoiled Children” references, stereotypes surrounding the individual schools (looking at you, Marshall snakes) and so on. 
The days of simple, lighthearted USC memes, however, are long gone. As darker days have descended upon a University plagued with scandal, the memes page and its student contributors have demonstrated that they want a stake in the conversation.
Last April, Daily Trojan published a feature about how the memes page has become the backbone for discussing campus culture. But now, what makes up USC’s “campus  culture” has changed dramatically. With USC constantly in the spotlight for its attempts to recover from various hits to its public image, USC memes are no longer just about discussion — they’re about coping.
Now a sophomore in college, I don’t know ‘SC without scandal, nor do I know scandal without its corresponding memes. 
The most recent scandal implicating USC as one of the eight colleges involved in the national college admissions bribery scheme was practically bred for virality. Most notably, former “Full House” star Lori Loughlin was accused of paying $500,000 to have her daughters admitted to USC through fabricated images of them rowing crew. Even though USC wasn’t the only school involved, when there’s a history of national scandals combined with A-list celebrities like Loughlin tied to the headline, infamy is inevitable.
This time, it wasn’t just USC students who went to town on the memes — it was the entire country.
My personal favorite post from the USC memes page poking fun at the admissions scandal is captioned “Hollywood glare be like” and depicts USC at a press conference receiving all of the attention while the other schools involved slip by unnoticed.
While everyone else was seemingly enamored with the details of the case, USC students (especially my very hard-working Daily Trojan colleagues) have come to accept the situation as an almost routine occurrence. Many joked that they were proud that USC had gone almost six months without a FBI investigation. In a time when scandal has become normalized, even expected, memes have become the way to both cope with the repercussions of scandal and escape reality.
Meme culture as a way of coping extends far beyond USC, too. Take any major societal event or tragedy, and a quick Twitter search will yield a plethora of memes attached to the situation. Even on a more personal level, individuals can find memes that relate to moments or mental health struggles in their lives (like my friend who made a meme about their breakup just to have some fun with it).
Everyone loves a good meme. I understand some may shake their heads at them, but if memes help us understand and deal with the challenges that life brings, then I’m all for it.

Dreamy chants of “Why, why, why” from the chorus of the song “Generation Why” gradually evolved into loud shouts of “Conan, Conan, Conan,” to welcome 20-year old heartthrob Conan Gray onto the stage at the El Rey Theatre Friday night. It was Gray’s second performance in Los Angeles and the fifth performance on tour for his debut EP “Sunset Season.” 
Indie artist Girl in Red set the perfect tone for Gray’s performance with her opening act. The singer, Marie Ulvin, sported her iconic rainbow-colored guitar strap, inciting a member in the audience to throw a rainbow flag onto the stage. Her affinity for audience interaction and her banter with the sound technicians put fans in the ideal space for Gray’s comparatively calmer yet equally passionate performance. 
Cool blue lights, floating clouds and theatrical smoke complemented Gray’s dreamy set. The small El Rey Theatre was the perfect location for the audience to feel intimately connected to the artist onstage. 
Gray alternated between grooving to “Greek God” and swaying slowly while singing “The Other Side.” The pattern continued throughout the concert, keeping the audience on its toes. His more upbeat performances were coupled with intense flashing purple lights, while calmer tracks were set against a memorable dreamy, blue and cloudy background. 
Gray introduced each of his songs with insights into his struggles and inspirations as a singer and songwriter. 
Before landing into “Idle Town,” Gray delivered a speech about growing up in a small town. In another instance, the audience reacted with screams when Gray posed a rhetorical question: “You know those people you’re so in love with that you know you’re never really going to get over them?” He then immediately delved into the heartfelt “Lookalike.” 
Gray also performed his unreleased “Comfort Crowd.” To introduce the number, Gray discussed missing his college friends during the summer when he needed them most. 
Gray ended his set with “Crush Culture,” wearing an orange hat much to the audience’s delight, as they threw out cries of “yeehaws.” Gray replied by channeling his own Texan energy: “Y’all gonna make me cry.”
The overall nostalgic dreaminess of Gray’s appeal was salient during his performance on Friday night. His defining style — dreamy alternative pop — is reminiscent of Troye Sivan’s first few songs in “TRXYE.” Gray embodied a similar dreamy attitude onstage, engrossing his young audience even further.

In recent years, it seems that USC is rocked by new revelations of a scandal or cover-up every other month. And like clockwork in the hours following the breaking news, students receive emails from University officials offering flimsy solutions and weak promises of change. It’s hardly surprising that USC is at the epicenter of a national investigation into college admissions fraud, demonstrating the indisputable need for sustained cultural reform at the University. 
Last week, three former coaches, along with former senior athletics associate director Donna Heinel, were indicted in a nationwide college admissions bribery case. Wealthy parents were accused of paying hundreds of thousands of dollars to athletic officials to portray their students as athletic recruits, or conspiring to boost their children’s standardized exam results by feigning learning disabilities or having other individuals sit in for tests in their child’s name. 
The initial FBI investigation into the case detailed 27 instances of parents cheating or bribing their kids’ ways into college. Of those, 16 involved USC, while most other universities were involved in just one or two instances. 
Sixteen instances of misconduct occurred at the top level of USC Athletics. Yet Athletic Director Lynn Swann claimed he was “blindsided” by the revelations of the investigation in a Los Angeles Times interview. Interim President Wanda Austin claimed the University was the “victim” of the scheme in an email to the USC community. Again and again, the University rolls over and acts helpless after it has turned a blind eye toward the systematic abuses of power happening under its own roof.
It’s clear that this wasn’t a small mistake that flew under the administration’s radar. This was a methodical, years-long operation that Heinel, a top administrator, was able to carry out because the University lacks meaningful checks and balances to prevent corruption at the highest levels of its administration.
Heinel allegedly accepted up to $1.3 million in bribes to admit unqualified students posing as athletic recruits. From the start of her employment at USC, it was clear that the University didn’t care to keep track of her ethical lapses: Heinel was able to advertise her own consulting business to prospective student athletes, making a profit off of a service that most college athletic departments offer for free, the Los Angeles Times reported. 
USC lacks a cohesive system of oversight to ensure accountability at all levels. It’s the same reason former campus gynecologist George Tyndall was able to practice for 30 years despite the complaints made about his alleged sexual misconduct. It’s the same reason former Keck School of Medicine dean Carmen Puliafito was able to allegedly use methamphetamines on the same days he saw patients. 
Scandal after scandal, USC consistently claims it isn’t at fault — even going so far as to pin itself as the victim in this most recent case — because it supposedly had no prior knowledge of these incidents. But this purported oblivion does not grant USC a clean slate just as the administration would like to have us believe. On the contrary, the University’s ignorance to egregious corruption reflects a gross, unforgivable negligence that further implicates USC for all of these scandals on its own. 
Under Austin’s leadership, the University has taken steps to increase accountability at the school. This included the creation of an Office of Professionalism and Ethics, the establishment of the USC Office of Ombuds and the hiring of a new vice president of ethics and compliance. 
But these changes feel cursory, and seem to place the onus on students, faculty and staff to submit complaints and serve as the watchdogs rather than actively holding University departments accountable. 
At present, every department at USC seems to operate on its own accord, with little to no central regulation or accountability. Without significant structural changes, the University’s penchant for scandal will see no end. 
USC should implement protocols throughout all departments to ensure that no one person or body is responsible for making major decisions — that means running such decisions through the Office of Professionalism and Ethics and the Office of the Ombuds to establish a system of checks and balances on every school, office and department at USC. 
Furthermore, the University needs to conduct comprehensive internal reviews of its top employees and decision-making bodies on a regular basis, perhaps annually or every six months — from the Office of Admission to the Board of Trustees. Naming offices to uphold ethics and accountability means nothing unless the University shows students and the USC community that it is truly enforcing both the University rules and the federal and state law. 
When former President C.L. Max Nikias was inaugurated in 2010, he claimed he would “run the next marathon at a sprinter’s pace.” And that’s exactly what he did — under Nikias’ leadership, the University reached its goal to raise $6 billion in just over six years and enjoyed a meteoric rise in national college rankings and prominence. 
But Nikias’ tunnel vision on fundraising and improving the school’s reputation allowed a culture rife with misconduct to fester below the surface, and the University is still reeling from its consequences, nearly a year after Nikias’ resignation. 
Even without Nikias at the helm, the mindset among top University administration officials and the Board of Trustees remains focused on maintaining USC’s reputation and prominence, rather than making structural changes within the University. At the end of the day, they only attempt damage control. There’s still little transparency with students and employees, and this series of scandals illustrates that the changes the University claims to have made don’t have much tangible effect. 
USC is made up of more than the rich kids described in the college admissions bribery case.  We are low-income students who work multiple jobs to pay our own ways through college. We are legacies who grew up fantasizing about one day donning cardinal and gold. We are first-generation students whose parents struggle to fund the elite educations they themselves could only dream of. We are transfers who applied multiple times because we believed so strongly in the value of getting an education here. We have worked hard to get here and we have placed our trust in USC. 
There are thousands of prospective students across the world just like us who are dreaming of getting into USC with wide-eyed anticipation. We were once those kids, but now, we can only look upon our University with disgust and outrage, while retaining an unwavering hope for improvement. Until USC brings about tangible changes to its mindset and culture at the top level, its students — past, present and future — cannot see it as the elite educational institution it claims to be.

“You’re saying it’s a falsehood […] Sean Spicer, our press secretary, gave alternative facts to that,” Kellyanne Conway, counselor to the president, said in 2017 on national television in an interview with NBC.
This quote was in reference to the lie former White House press secretary Sean Spicer told in his very first press conference that Trump’s inauguration had been attended by the largest audience in history. Conway’s words, particularly her claim of the viability of “alternative facts,” have come to represent a trend made evident by Trump and his administration, in what political scientists have dubbed the “Post-Truth” era.  
The term encompasses the idea that public opinion is shaped increasingly by emotional appeal and decreasingly by objective fact. This is demonstrated by the list of falsehoods that Trump has made throughout his presidency; according to the Washington Post, he has made over 9,000 false or misleading claims since assuming office. Among these was the boast he made to the United Nations in September of 2018 that his administration had accomplished more than almost any other in history. This claim was met with laughter. 
Yet his lies find great success, at least among his supporters, because he offers a narrative that is not only flashy and seductive but, critically, one that his intended audience has already accepted. This gets to the heart of our Post-Truth problem: The departure from the truth is not inherent in our politicians, but in ourselves. The public has become far less discerning with information that is presented to them, and more sloppy in the process of forming judgments. Instead of drawing opinions from the evidence, we’ve begun to place facts nearer the end of the process, where they do little more than reaffirm our prior convictions. Our problem, then, is not in the propagation of untruths, but in their wide and unquestioning acceptance. 
As tempting as it is to blame this trend on the president’s disregard for truth, Trump is but a sign of the times. We are likely witnessing the culmination of several societal shifts. For one, our politics have more consistently recognized the rhetorical value of entertainment. Trump understood this especially well in the 2016 election, utilizing his Twitter account to make snappy jabs at his opponents. Catchier information inevitably grabs public attention; it’s far more gratifying to read a 140-character tweet that the “concept of global warming was created by and for the Chinese in order to make US manufacturing non-competitive,” than it is to painstakingly pore over the data and form an independent judgment yourself.     
Another likely cause is the age of digitalisation, which floods an online viewership with too much information to effectively verify. After all, when’s the last time you fact-checked an article online? In climate change denial and the anti-vaccine movement, we see the grim repercussions of our devaluing of truth. 
The Post-Truth era is an indication of our collective response to information, and it is through monitoring our responses that we can resist its perpetuation. Primarily, we must become skeptics of any information presented to us. Through the internet, we are all publishers. This makes holding an opinion a responsibility, one that requires you to check, assess and verify every claim, especially if it pillars your own beliefs. 
Post-Truth is a symptom of our willingness to believe, and our eagerness to be right. We have been slipping into a state of vulnerability, becoming the kind of society that a foreign agent or authoritarian ruler would lick their lips at. It is not too late to reverse this trend, but any solution requires us to demand the truth, and to settle for nothing less. The facts are out there, and it’s our job to find them.
