This past week, the women’s soccer team tallied two wins — topping Loyola Marymount University and the University of San Diego. Both victories were in comeback fashion, which improved the Trojans’ overall record to 6-1.
On Friday, No. 12 USC began its three-game stretch against Loyola Marymount. The Lions entered the game with a 4-2-1 record. LMU has weathered a pair tough opponents this year, beating No. 17 Utah and drawing against No. 22 Northwestern. These two matchups helped prepare LMU for USC, but were not enough, as the Trojans topped the Lions 2-1 in a come-from-behind affair.
The first half of the match was scoreless on both sides. The Trojan defense once again allowed zero shots in the first half, while their offense tallied 10. USC had multiple scoring opportunities but was unable to find the back of the net. Six of USC’s recorded shots came from junior forward Leah Pruitt. 
The second half had both USC and LMU fans biting their nails. The first goal of the match came in the 66th minute off a free kick from just inside the Trojans’ zone. The ball crossed over the Trojan box, and LMU redshirt junior midfielder Melissa Lewis finished the pass far post to give the Lions the lead. 
That goal lit a fire under the Women of Troy. From that point on, the Trojans were back to playing the aggressive style that they had against Iowa State. Recording 15 shots in the second half, USC fought hard for the equalizer. However, the Lion defense played strong in the back field. It wasn’t until the 86th minute that the Women of Troy tied things up. At the top of the
18-yard box, Pruitt received the ball, dribbled past the LMU defender and placed a shot just within the near post to tie the score at 1-1. 
But the Trojans weren’t satisfied with the tie. Just before the equalizer, junior defender Erika Okuma entered the game. And two minutes after the Trojans tied the score, Okuma received a square ball from senior midfielder Nicole Molen and rifled a perfect ball into the near-post top corner from 35 yards out. This marked Okuma’s first collegiate goal and gave the Trojans the 2-1 lead with just two minutes remaining. 
“I have to give credit to Erika, even though she didn’t play very many minutes on the evening, she was able to come off the bench and do her job,” head coach Keidane McAlpine said. “Last weekend, we were not able to find that kind of production off the bench, and all the credit goes to her tonight. Coming out and being able to execute the way she did was fantastic.”
LMU had a few scoring opportunities in the final minutes, but the Trojan defense was able to hold off the Lions to secure the win.  
With a 5-1 record, the Women of Troy headed south on Sunday to face off against the University of San Diego in USC’s final non-conference matchup. 
In just 18 seconds, the Toreros were already on the board. From the left side of the 18-yard box, junior forward Summer Mason delivered a shot to the top right corner of the USC goal to put San Diego up 1-0. 
The Women of Troy quickly rebounded — generating scoring opportunities and capitalizing on them. In the 17th minute, Trojan redshirt senior forward Alex Anthony found the equalizer on a cross from redshirt junior midfielder Sydney Myers. Four minutes later, the Trojans added another one to the scoreboard. From the top of the box, freshman midfielder Savannah DeMelo released a bender into the top left corner on a pass from Anthony to make the score 2-1. The rest of the half was scoreless, and USC outshot USD 7-3.
The Trojans maintained the aggressive play style throughout the second half, something they have struggled with in recent games. Within the first five minutes, with an assist from freshman forward Tara McKeown, Anthony reached the back of the net for her second goal of the night. This extended the Trojans’ lead to 3-1 and marked the first time a Trojan has scored two goals in a single match this season. 
With a comfortable two-goal lead, many Trojans saw playing time. Senior goalkeeper Julia Murphy made her first appearance this season. And junior forward Hailey Hite appeared in her first game this season after suffering an ACL tear last October.
With two victories this past week, the Women of Troy are on the upswing as they head into their first conference match against No. 25 Utah on Sept. 23.

Rounding off another perfect weekend, the second-ranked men’s water polo team continued its winning run to advance to 9-0 on the season after facing No. 15 Cal Baptist and MIT on Saturday and Santa Clara and No. 6 Long Beach State on Sunday. Despite facing two top-ranked teams, the Trojans were not fazed and continued sticking to their system to get the wins. 
USC started off the weekend with a bang as different players scored the team’s first nine goals against Cal Baptist. The Trojans showed their depth of skill not only on the scoring front, but also in the cage. Senior goalie McQuin Baron had seven saves by the end of the game and became the program’s all-time saves leader, passing previous holder Joel Dennerley, who played on the team from 2008 to 2011.
By the end of the tournament, Baron had not only passed the previous record of 855 saves, but had also gone well on his way to exceeding that record. He finished the tournament with his 869th goal and is quickly proving it will be difficult for anyone to match his tally. Throughout the tournament, the Trojans did not hold anything back. On Sunday, 12 players scored against Santa Clara, and eight made their mark against Long Beach State. Many players, like sophomore 2-meter man Matt Maier, ended with 10 goals by the end of the tournament. Others, like senior 2-meter man Lachlan Edwards and redshirt sophomore driver Daniel Leong, who put up 17 goals combined, made their mark on the games this last weekend.
Their closest match of the tournament came at the end against No. 6 Long Beach State. The two finally faced during the season after a handful of scrimmages over the summer. The game was tied in the first half three separate times by the 49ers, but the Trojans finished the half with a strong run to give them the lead before finishing the period. 
USC returned with the same energy in the second half that would eventually shut the 49ers out for the entirety of the fourth period and clinch the Trojans their final victory of the tournament.
After a long, but successful weekend, the Trojans have to turn around and prepare for both a solo game on Thursday and hosting the MPSF tournament this weekend at the Uytengsu Aquatics Center.

Universal Studios Hollywood was transformed into a terror theme park for its annual Halloween Horror Nights event on September 16. The lineup this year featured the most popular villains from television and cinematic history, from works like The Shining, Friday the 13th, Insidious and American Horror Story, which were adapted into maze attractions to send visitors into their own horror story remake.
Immediately upon entry, visitors are greeted by the chainsaw-wielding Leatherface, zombies, freaky Freddy Krueger from Nightmare on Elm Street and other swarming ghouls singling out the most terrified guests to inflict more horror before the mazes.
The crowd favorites — the Insidious, The Shining and American Horror Story mazes — had wait times of nearly an hour to two hours once the event filled up throughout the night. However, the sheer amount of detail within each maze that truly transforms a visitor’s experience into a real-life horror film makes it well worth the wait.
Perhaps the most psychologically thrilling experience was The Shining’s maze, directed by John Murdy, which showcases an ominous hedge as its entrance. The attraction relies on a number of various visual illusions to bring scenes from the movie to life, such as the eerie appearance of the Grady twins, who were murdered in the hotel, and a blood-gushing elevator. 
The maze surprisingly does not offer immediate jump scares; rather, the visitor moves room-to-room in a symbolic psychological meltdown, representative of the movie’s main character Jack’s delusion. As Jack and the visitor likewise descend into a horror hell, the number of jump scares increases, ending with the emblematic “Here’s Johnny!” scene from the movie before visitors rush out of the hedge maze. 
In comparison, the American Horror Story maze offers a multitude of jump scares and gory scenes taken from the “Roanoke” season. The maze institutes a few lifelike details to heighten the horror experience, such as the smell of smoked ham and baby powder. 
Beyond the traditional maze attraction, the Titans of Terror Tram, hosted by Chucky, the terrifying doll, transports guests to a completely new setting as they face villains like Leatherface, Jason and Freddy outdoors after being dropped off by Chucky’s tram.
Compared to the carefully engineered indoor mazes, the Terror Tram lacked the close-up element of horror guests enjoyed. Although the outdoor setting creates a feeling of pure isolation from reality, the large number of people made the experience less frightening overall.
The attractions also weave in a few movie promotions. On the tram’s screen on the way back to the main park, Chucky promotes his own upcoming remake. Visitors to the Saw-themed maze also received a preview of the upcoming movie Jigsaw, set for release in October. However, the Saw-themed maze captures the gory element of its films, showcasing the infamous reverse bear trap, automated scalping machine and other iconic horror scenes from the series.
Universal’s Horror Nights offers a healthy dose of fright to guests, but for seasoned horror enthusiasts, there is lack of a surprise factor for those used to jump scares in mazes. As guests move from one attraction to the next, there is no scare element past the chaotic smoke-filled pathway that leads visitors deep into the park. 
Mazes like The Shining, however, offer a psychological element that creates an unforgettably thrilling, although ominous, sense of dread.
Universal Studios Hollywood is also offering the “College Thursdays Terror Pass” (ushtix.com/usc) which allows students, faculty and staff, with .edu email addresses, the option to visit Halloween Horror Nights every Thursday night throughout the run of the event.

The women’s cross country team took on the 37th annual UC Riverside Invitational on Saturday in Riverside, Calif., competing in both the 6K invitational race and 5K open race and taking 25th out of 29 teams in the 6K and 18th out of 27 teams in the 5K.
The race was the Trojans’ second of the season, although their first at the longer 5K and 6K distances. After placing fourth at the Pepperdine Invitational on Sept. 1, the team continued to refine racing strategies in preparation for later-season races like the Pac-12 championships. Head coach Patrick Henner recognized junior Amber Gore, sophomore Chloe Berry, junior Lauren Maurer and freshman Jennifer Daly for their preparations leading into the race.
“We put in a really good two-week training block, so we weren’t really coming out here looking to have an incredible day racing,” Henner said. “[But] I saw some good improvements … so the pieces are there.”
Gore, the team captain, was USC’s first finisher in the 6K, running 21:40.9 to take 70th place, only 12 seconds off her personal record of 21:32.6 set in 2016. Berry led the Trojans in the 5K with an 18:54.1 for 65th. 
Behind Gore, Maurer was the Trojans’ second finisher, with a personal record of 22:29.2. Freshmen Julia Bounds and Sydney Tullai ran times of 23:56.6 and 24:23.3, respectively, in their first 6K race, followed by junior transfer Angelica Vallier with a time of 25:43.1. 
In the 5K, Daly followed close behind Berry with a PR of 19:06.5. Sophomore Kamryn Weber, just 0.2 seconds off her PR, ran a 19:32.4, junior Rachel Glynn a 20:17.0 and freshman Mackenzie Ellison a 21:04.8 to round out the Trojans’ scoring. 
On Saturday, the Trojans will run at University of Nevada-Las Vegas Cross Country Invitational at Craig Ranch Regional Park in Las Vegas. The race, a two-and-a-half-loop 5K course, is scheduled to start at 8 a.m.
“It is just going to be a process for us, the training and learning how to race,” Henner said. “We just have to keep getting better week after week.”

Born and raised in Los Angeles County, Jennifer Lee is known internationally for her DJ and music production abilities under the stage name TOKiMONSTA. While a great deal of electronic music enthusiasts know of her music and high-profile collaborations such as Thirsty Fish, Kool Keith, MDNR and Anderson.Paak, many of her fans are unaware of the medical challenges she has faced and overcome.
Pitchfork recently reported on Lee’s experience with Moyamoya disease, a Japanese word meaning “puff of smoke.” Moyamoya is an uncommon yet severe condition in which the carotid artery in the brain is obstructed, reducing blood flow to the brain. If untreated, Moyamoya may result in an aneurysm or mini-stroke. Keeping the diagnosis within her personal circle, Lee took time off from playing festivals and creating music to undergo surgery, which upon completion was successful, but came with serious repercussions. Things that had always come so naturally for Lee — walking, speech and especially music — suddenly became foreign and difficult. After allowing herself time to recover, these abilities came back and led to the completion of her fifth album Lune Rouge. 
Not only has TOKiMONSTA fully regained her music-making ability, but to add to her accomplishments, just three months after her surgery in January 2016, she played a set in the Sahara tent both weekends of the Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival. 
The album, set for release on Oct. 4, derives its authenticity from the raw emotions of overcoming a seemingly unsurpassable challenge. The album opens with “Lune,” an entirely instrumental track, which highlights Lee’s classical musical training in its grace and simplicity. 
 Flowing directly into the second track, compelling beats complement softer, angelic vocals on “Rouge,” where more melody-focused “Rose’s Thorn” gives Lee the freedom to explore a variety of sounds, all of which add a great deal of depth. Lee invokes some of her Korean lineage in the song “Bibimbap,” which features sounds that resemble a gayageum, a traditional Korean string instrument.
The song that most evidently reflects how Lee’s recent personal experiences have influenced her music is single “Don’t Call Me” where the opening lyrics are: “Hey, I never thought this love could go so wrong / And so it did and you know that I moved on / I never heard from you for so long,” likely referring to her breakup.
“My boyfriend broke up with me — after my surgery, after taking care of me,” Lee said in an interview with Pitchfork. “That moment was probably the worst I’ve ever felt in my entire life. But that sadness allowed me to regain some clarity. I knew I had to overcome it.” 
As a whole, Lune Rouge demonstrates Lee’s diverse skill set as a producer. Each of the 11 tracks on the album exemplifies a different style, from Korean-influenced “Bibimbap” to hip-hop and rap influenced “NO WAY,” featuring Isaiah Rashad, Joey Purp and Ambré Perkins. 
For those who want to witness the magic and have the pleasure of listening to the album before it is released, she will perform at the Wiltern on Friday.

In a political climate that can only be compared to a month-old salmon filet festering in the hot sun, I find myself turning to music to ease the stress currently plaguing our great nation. Given the fact that the current administration has already caused me so much distress, there has been an exponential rise in the amount of music I’ve been listening to. 
These days, I’ve been exploring operas that I have yet to familiarize myself with. I recently discovered Gaetano Donizetti’s bel-canto masterpiece Lucia Di Lammermoor, which has been on my radar for some time. Using Met HD On Demand (basically Netflix for opera), I carefully selected one of 12 recordings to choose from, all recorded live from the Metropolitan Opera stage throughout the last six decades. I eventually chose the first recording, from 1956, with Maria Callas in the title role.
The most beautiful thing about music is that one could be listening continually for a lifetime, and there will still be artists, songs, genres and operas to be discovered. The possibilities are theoretically endless. Lucia Di Lammermoor sits as a weird exception for me personally — this opera is already extremely popular among operaphiles, and it’s a title that I’ve heard and read of endlessly in passing. However, given the vast catalogue of operas written since the 17th century, there are bound to be holes in my overall knowledge of this great art form. I figured this opera would come into my life at the right time, like other operas have in the past and I assume others will in the future.
I usually associate each time period in my life with the music I was listening to at the time. Incidentally, with the commencement of fall upon us, I can already feel my seasonal depression flaring up. And as much as I love the fall and winter seasons for their cozy appeal, I know that these next few months are going to be difficult. 
But at least I have Lucia by my side as common company. The titular character, Lucia Ashton, is based on The Bride of Lammermoor by Sir Walter Scott, written in the 19th century. Lucia is anxious, referred to by the fragility and delicacy of her emotional state. Though my personality isn’t one-dimensional like the ones I commonly relate to in these operas, I found that I connected with her sensitivity.  She is in love with Edgardo of Ravenswood, the rival family of the Ashtons of Lammermoor. She sets out to marry Edgardo in secret, though after familial involvement she is forced to marry Arturo, Lord of Bucklaw. Things get especially juicy when she goes mad on her wedding night, killing Arturo in the process.
Talk about a red wedding.
But even before any of the shenanigans begin, Lucia begins with her aria “Regnava nel silenzio” (“Reigned in silence”) by recalling an encounter she had with the ghost of a girl who was killed in the spot she’s currently standing. The ghost warns her that her imminent marriage will only end in bloodshed. And yet she goes through with it. Maybe I’m reading too much into things, but regardless of who she marries, won’t there be bloodshed no matter what? Not literally or physically, but emotionally and mentally? In relationships, no matter how in love you are with someone, there is always inevitable pain and suffering that goes along with the harmonious moments. But as someone great once said, (I forgot who and don’t have the patience or time to look it up), there are as many good moments in a relationship as there are bad. It went something like that, I think. Whether this quote is fake or not, I really do believe it to be true.
I don’t believe in soulmates. You just find someone who you care about and with whom you are willing to make it work. Lucia may have believed Edgardo to be her true love, but their relationship was never tested for compatibility. For example, I’m sure Lucia and Edgardo never tried to build IKEA furniture together, or they probably would have broken up much sooner. No relationship is ever going to be stress free — it’s stupid to think otherwise, because something will inevitably come up. However, there is something to be said about the people you choose to make it work with. And with this being the Trump era, it is best to have someone by your side to help you through it. But you need to take care of yourself first. 
I sometimes worry my pessimism affects my relationship with my boyfriend, Matthew. I mean, our relationship thrives because of our honesty — and if I’m being honest, Lucia has every right to be anxious about the state of the world. And she lived way before the Trump administration, so Lord knows how’d she react if she were a millennial. But if there is anything she has taught me (or rather didn’t teach me, because she didn’t end up marrying Edgardo and things still ended in bloodshed), it’s to listen to your gut and to keep yourself a priority. Relationships come and go, but you’re stuck with yourself forever.

Last Sunday’s Emmy Awards witnessed a multitude of progressive achievements. In a year where television leaned more toward sociopolitical commentary than escapism from sociopolitical issues, the Academy of Television Arts and Sciences recognized Lena Waithe, Riz Ahmed and Donald Glover as firsts in their respective categories. Waithe, recognized for Writing for a Comedy Series, was the first black woman to win the award; Ahmed was the first South Asian man to secure an Emmy for acting; Glover was the first black person to win the comedy directing statue for his work on Atlanta. 
It is a profound and empowering point that these artists were recognized for complicated and compelling work that pulled from their own cultural themes and further pushed the boundaries of television.  
On the red carpet, the creator and star of HBO’s Insecure Issa Rae commented, “I’m rooting for everybody black,” in an interview with Variety. On Twitter, there were those who immediately leapt to criticize her, asserting that it is hypocritical to evaluate artists based on their race. On the other hand, there is the alluring and empowering move of supporting artists who have shared one’s struggle and whose victories clearly hold large implications — a choice perhaps justified by the current political climate. 
It’s a thinking that works, and that emboldens minorities and minority artists, and that ultimately moves this industry forward. But at the end of the day, and at the beginning of tomorrow, what completes the desperate void Hollywood is finally filling is attention paid to everyone: to the black, Asian American, Hispanic, LGBTQ+ and disabled artists, and everyone who does not fit into what has always been.
No minority voice, even one that belongs to someone in a position of influence, should be interpreted as speaking for everyone in their “group.” It is utterly important to advocate for those who share one’s culture, heritage, upbringing and stories, especially ones that present complicated, flawed characters, who stand uniquely for themselves. 
At the same time, it is imperative to advocate for the stories of minorities across the board and to recognize that the tapestry of television becomes only richer when more diversity is added. 
It is imperative to recognize that the Emmy Awards last Sunday did not mark the peak of TV as an industry of progress but instead its beautiful beginning, to understand that the most brilliant and original art is created when diversity and intersectionality convene. 
Last night, The Handmaid’s Tale took home the award for best drama series, and though it has received its fair share of criticism leveled toward its depiction of mostly white femininity, it is a startling reality that the show won when Stranger Things, The Crown or Westworld could just as easily have sprung to victory. 
Instead of delving into the past or nodding its head toward a world of fantasy, the Academy chose to honor a work based on a novel that has always been about the tremendous worth of women, the inherent power in each of them and the horrifyingly real concept of a nation that disregards their rights to their own bodies. 
Television remains one of the most fearless and experimental forms of entertainment, and it is no coincidence that this medium and its players are embracing their potential to push social change. For both the artists and the audiences they stand to inspire, it has never been a more exciting time.

Most Americans would probably not look too kindly on a German university maintaining plaques dedicated to those who died fighting for Nazism. Most might also be able to sympathize with Jewish students who pay and enroll as anyone else — only to show up and be greeted with the commemoration of a regime that sought to exterminate them. It is deeply unfortunate, then, that this country is able to materialize such vicious outrage at the prospect of the University of Virginia removing its own Confederate plaques.
For argument’s sake, let’s return to the hypothetical German university. Ask yourself how you would look upon the German people if they expressed grief and anger over the removal of Nazi propaganda. It might give you the impression, perhaps, that they had fond memories of Hitler and his regime; that they enjoyed nostalgic glances back at that murderous time; that they wished to hold onto remnants of its existence. 
But this is not the Germany we know today. In actuality, the nation has gone to great lengths to expunge any and all Nazism from its collective culture, political psychology and, for that matter, foreseeable future. And this is exactly how any reasonable, free, industrialized nation should approach its genocidal fallen regimes: With a cautious acknowledgement of the power of hatred, commitment to education and removal of the iconography of a vicious and disgusting past.
For better or worse, our previous missteps and failings have contributed to the great legacy we value today. But let’s get something straight: The Confederacy is not a point of pride for the South. It destroyed our economy,  shackled our local governments to Northern control and decimated our population. Most importantly, it attempted to maintain the horrors of a world and an economy surviving on the savagery of human slavery. 
The Congressional politics of the late 19th century were complicated but secession was unequivocally a huge political, tactical and economic mistake. And those who try to cloak its bloodshed in a golden glow of history, commemorative legacy or cultural preservation have no other aims but to resurrect the only part of the antebellum South they truly know or understand — white supremacy. For all the rich history and legacy of the American South, these cultural “preservers” seem awfully obsessed with a certain four years out of those past 300.
By removing these Confederate plaques, the University of Virginia is simply taking another important step toward removing another avenue for Confederate hero worship. For many years, the university has maintained plenty of other historical sites and commemorative decor in and around its campus. The University of Virginia values its cultural history; it simply refuses to celebrate a time in which it found itself on its most amoral and most misguided path. 
Sure, those men died fighting to preserve their preferred culture and way of life; shall we also erect a statue of Joseph Goebbels, who died doing exactly the same thing? The fact remains that simply dying for a cause does not automatically warrant the veneration of your “sacrifice,” and thereby your cause. To choose to self-sacrifice for evil purposes also implies the right of your descendants to look back and see that sacrifice as unfortunate and unconscionable. 
In a sense, these plaques are racist while also being seen as the participation ribbons of historical preservation. To dedicate one’s life to splitting and destroying the United States and the American legacy does not earn one’s right to be remembered on a plaque at a public American university. 
We should laud the University of Virginia for taking an ethical approach to the curation of its campus history. Virginia, and the whole of the South for that matter, lives on today. It looks toward a future full of the rich culture, art and tradition for which it has always been known. The South is not the Confederate legacy — and it should refuse to be defined as such. 
Good reasoning, for the most part, anyway. It is time to cease glorifying the Confederacy and its vicious practices and its treasonous objectives. It is time to place Confederate flags, statues and mementos in museums, as part of American history, although certainly not a glorious one.
I do not; however, agree, with one grossly false analogy that you make about Joseph Goebbels, the Nazi minister of propaganda. Goebbels was an evil monster, like his deity, Adolf Hitler. But Goebbels never “fought and died for his culture,” as you claim. He was no brave soldier. Not even a misguided one.
Goebbels never served in the military, nor fought as a soldier against Nazi Germany’s enemies. He ran the Nazi propaganda and media machine, justifying mass murder and the other hideous crimes of the Nazi Third Reich.
On 1 May, during the final days of the dying Reich, he murdered his six little children, and then committed suicide. He died to affirm for history his dog-like loyalty to Hitler, who also committed suicide. 
I do not champion the evil of slavery, nor the Confederacy’s efforts to destroy the Union, to preserve slavery. Nor can I, or any sane person, defend the evil Nazi Joseph Goebbels. Even so, no reasonable analogy exists to equate Goebbels to the soldiers of the Confederacy.

The USC School of Architecture’s undergraduate and graduate programs rose up in the rankings this year based on a national survey of architecture schools by DesignIntelligence. The undergraduate program jumped from 11 to 5 in the rankings, while the graduate program was ranked ninth, despite not being in the top 20 list last year.
According to David Gilmore, CEO of DesignIntelligence, significant jumps in rank are often tied to national perception of the program, faculty prestige and program engagement with its alumni. However, Gilmore said USC’s jump was unique this year.
“We see little change in the rankings from last year at the undergraduate level,” Gilmore said in an interview with Architectural Record. “Except for the University of Southern California, there are no new players in the top 10 this year.” 
Douglas Noble, who directs USC’s Master of Building Science program, agreed that improving the perception of the programs was a key contributor.
“The biggest thing [the school] did was simply letting people know [our strengths],” Noble said. “If [the school is] good, but [it] does not let others know what you are doing, the program will suffer in the rankings.” 
Noble cited the school’s specialized degree programs, design theory group, global leadership performance and extensive research as part of the efforts that contributed to outside recognition. 
In addition to the overall program rankings, USC also ranked in the top 5 among DesignIntelligence’s listed skill sets, which include research, design, sustainability and construction knowledge.
“We have great strengths in sustainability and the building sciences,” Noble said.
USC’s architecture program boasted alumni like Jon Jerde, who designed the Universal CityWalk, and Frank Gehry, who developed the Walt Disney Concert Hall. Additionally, the school lists two Pritzker Prize laureates among its graduates. 
Brian Rohrlick, a senior majoring architecture, said the program excels in preparing students for their careers.
“I appreciate how open-ended and flexible the program is in letting students explore and invest in their own creative styles and visions,” Rohrlick said. “Networking and job opportunities are as fun and accessible as they come, with studio instructors having their own respective practices and other architects from around L.A. sitting in on reviews.”
Noble also said that USC offers students unique opportunities because of its culture and location.
“I am able to take advantage of the Trojan Family network on a daily basis to get professional architects to come to our school, while being located in Los Angeles provides our students with a dynamic architecture environment to play in,” Noble said.
Sofia Borges and R. Scott Mitchell, both professors of architecture, exemplified this sentiment last June by leading a group of students to build a small shelter out of scrap materials. Their goal is to mass-produce these units in order to tackle the housing crisis in Los Angeles, where nearly 58,000 people are homeless.
In order to nurture a wide spectrum of interests, from social impact to set design, Noble said that diversifying the school’s faculty and professional connections has been a priority.
“Our school has many types of faculty, from those who are professional architects to those who do pure research,” Noble said. “We increased our efforts to get all of these types more recognition.”
In addition, the USC School of Architecture appointed a new dean this year, Milton S.F. Curry, who has been noted for his expertise on race, architecture and urbanism that engages cultural theory and humanities research.
“I am overwhelmingly positive about the future [Dean Curry] can bring us,” Noble said.

Just three years away from its 2020 sustainability goal, USC is taking steps to further its waste diversion program through a partnership with student organizations like Clover, Environmental Student Assembly and the Environmental Core during football tailgates.
The Tailgate Waste Diversion Program, which will continue throughout the football season, has seen a 65 percent increase in waste diversion, since its implementation in 2012. 
The Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum adopted the Zero Waste Policy as an annual endeavor for all sporting events in Fall 2015. 
According to the USC Sustainability website, approximately 14 percent of waste produced on campus can be recycled. However, the website states that after every game, several thousands of disposable utensils, decorations and plastic cups litter the campus. 
Olivia Pearson, the co-executive director of the Environmental Student Assembly,  said the tailgate program spreads awareness about sustainability tactics on campus.  
“[Student organizations have been helping] volunteers come out … going around and collecting recyclables, trying to divert them from the main waste stream, as well as educating fans and tailgaters about how to properly recycle [and] what is and isn’t recyclable,” Pearson said. 
USC Sustainability is also planning to switch waste vendors, from Athens Services, which sorts recyclables at their facilities, to Republic Services. This means that recyclables will be sorted on site at USC. 
“We’re going to see more recycling bins coming to campus starting this semester and progressively spreading across the entire campus over the next few subsequent semesters,” Pearson said. 
Jessica Sara Cohen, who administers the Waste and Recycling program, works with USC Sustainability to increase student engagement with the tailgate initiative. 
“Our Tailgate Waste Diversion program works [through] a partnership between Facilities Management and USC Sustainability,” Cohen said. “A student coordinator with USC Sustainability, who works directly with the student groups to gather volunteers.”
The Zero Waste Tailgate Diversion Program largely depends on students and volunteers to increase its visibility and efficiency. 
“With the help of our student volunteers, we set up recycling and compost bins at the different tailgates around campus,” said Jack Wilson, a student worker at USC Sustainability. “Zero waste basically means we qualify for 90 percent of our trash to get either composted or recycled. With the help of our volunteers, we’re basically going around and trying to educate people, give them the option to recycle, get as many bins out there, and increase the visibility of this [movement].” 
Though Pearson said it has been a difficult process to recruit volunteers for the program, the organization will continue to aim to reduce the number of recyclable and compostable items in landfills.
“I have seen an increase in support from students volunteering for this program, or people asking me more questions about what they do [in order] to volunteer, which I think is a very positive sign that we are going in the right direction … I think we just need to create more dialogue around it [to increase] awareness for this program,” Pearson said.
