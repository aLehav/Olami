Elissa Loughman, an environmental analyst for the Ventura-based clothing company Patagonia, spoke about sustainability practices within businesses at the Marshall School of Business’ monthly “Lunch and Learn” series.

Loughman, who has a bachelor’s degree in zoology and a master’s in environmental science and management, focused on the environmentally conscious outfitter’s strategies for sustainability and waste reduction. Eight years ago, when she applied for the company’s internship, Loughman didn’t think she would fit in at a company like Patagonia.
“I’m not a designer,” Loughman said. “I have no fashion sense and I’m not a sales person at all. What would I do for a company that makes and sells clothes?”
As it turned out, Loughman would end up doing quite a lot.
According to Loughman, since the 1970s, the company mission has been to “build the best product, cause no unnecessary harm, use business to inspire and implement solutions to the environmental crisis.”
To build the best product, Loughman says, Patagonia believes in a design that is durable, long-lasting, failure resistant and repairable if necessary. Manufacturing products that can be used for years without wear reduces waste and improves efficiency, she noted. In addition, Loughman helps Patagonia develop products that are earth-friendly and use more sustainable raw materials. Patagonia’s cotton products are USDA-certified 100 percent organic, and the company is pursuing strategies for waterless dying.
The company is also creating initiatives to encourage more environmentalism among its customers. Patagonia began its “Common Threads” initiative, which recycles and converts its customers’ used cotton clothes into usable cotton. In addition, the company partnered with eBay to sell cotton products online, resulting in the company being landfill-free since 2011, according to Loughman.
Yet Patagonia doesn’t rely on internal practices alone to promote its sustainability campaign. The company has reached out to its supply chain in order to implement sustainable solutions to environmental crises, according to Loughman. The company’s webpages, such as The Footprint Chronicles, show customers the process of how their products are made. Patagonia also sells its “1% For The Planet” products, donating that portion of the profit from those products to environmental organizations.
Some students said Loughman’s speech made them optimistic about the shift to a corporate economy. Ian Ritchey, a junior majoring in business administration, believes Patagonia’s ideology is a positive aspect of the company.
“The high price tag deters a large number of consumers, which is counterintuitive as a for-profit company,” Ritchey said. “But they know what they are doing and they are clearly doing [it] well.”
Loughman knows that transforming the way corporations relate to the environment is a long and difficult process. Through her work, however, it is clear that she is fulfilling the goal she set for herself when she applied for an internship with the company eight years ago. Patagonia’s acute focus on environmentalism and customer awareness within their business model reflects Loughman’s greater goals.
“I knew I wanted to do something bigger,” Loughman said. “There is no business to be done on a dead planet.”
 
The next “Lunch and Learn” will take place in March and will feature Josh Nesbit, co-founder and CEO of Medic Mobile.

Fraternities affiliated with the Interfraternity Council celebrated their new pledge classes by holding off-campus parties Saturday night, a change from hosting parties on The Row.
The new bid night rules come as a university decision to enforce a moratorium on fraternity parties until after the rushing process is over, in hopes of improving the Greek system’s image and reducing safety risks and costs.
Though the new regulations affected the usual rush process, IFC President Ofek Lavian said the new policy attracts more noble pledges.
“On one hand, less kids might have known about or been excited about rush because there weren’t any pre-rush parties,” Lavian said. “However, on the contrary, I think that there were more kids coming out for the right reasons and joining a house for the brotherhood, rather than for that one crazy night they had at a party.”
Leaders in individual fraternities were also optimistic about the new rules. Lambda Chi Alpha President Ryan Kerr said the lack of parties ensured event attendees during rush were serious about joining fraternities.
“I honestly think the entire rush process ran better without the pre-rush parties,” Kerr said. “Those parties encouraged guys who had no plans to rush to crash parties, which sometimes caused them to get out of hand. We still ended up with a great pledge class and were still able to have a great bid night for them.”
Bids were sent out electronically  Saturday, and those who accepted a bid participated in bid night events later that night. Historically, fraternities have hosted large parties to celebrate the new pledge classes and the end of the moratorium. But because new university rules prohibit bid-night parties on The Row, fraternities threw off-campus events.
“In terms of bid night, I think that at first, people don’t like change,” Lavian said. “But I think it’s getting to be more interesting — parties are something we do all of the time, and so having a party on bid night is not very special. Now, frats have to think about how to make bid night special and how to do something different.”
Not all Greeks were thrilled about the new regulations preventing them from partying during the first two weeks of school. Sarah Brooks, a sophomore majoring in human biology and a member of the Delta Gamma sorority, said the cancellation of pre-rush parties not only affected the fraternity rush process, but the entire Greek community as a whole.
“It’s really unfortunate that the university decided to cancel pre-rush parties, because they’re a fun way to kick off the new semester and see everyone again before getting back to the grind of the school year,” Brooks said. “Plus, it helps the guys going through rush to see what a typical night at that house is like, and girls have a chance to meet the potential new fraternity members.”
Greek leaders agree that the new terms can help improve relations between the university and the Greek system. Sigma Chi Vice President Hayden Wolf said that Greek leaders want to cooperate with the university in hopes of regaining some of its privileges.
“We want to have normal social privileges before rush, but we are also willing to compromise with the university by not throwing the blowout type of events the pre-rush used to be known for,” Wolf said. “I think the new IFC administration will allow for the Greek system to regain some of its past liberties by focusing on individual houses rather than allowing the entire Greek system to be punished by the university.”
The Dept. of Public Safety tracks and monitors the number of students transported to the hospital as a result of toxic levels of alcohol consumption, according to DPS Capt.  David Carlisle. Over the weekend, significantly fewer students were transported to the hospital than during rush in the Fall 2012 semester, according to Carlisle, though it’s unclear whether that was because of the new policy.
“During fall semester we had 86 alcohol transports,” Carlisle said. “During this weekend we had one, but I don’t know if that is completely related to the cancellation of bid night.”
In this academic year, the number of alcohol-related hospital transports is the same as the total number of students taken to the hospital throughout the entire 2011-12 academic year.
Lavian, for one, felt the significant decrease in alcohol incidents made the rush process much smoother.
“The lack of incidents during rush is actually one of the biggest triumphs that this Greek system and IFC board has seen,” Lavian said. “That’s something we can all be proud of.”
 
IFC seems like a bunch of University lackeys to me.  Are they an independent group or hand picked by the administration?  If you are old enough to fight for your country, and now the girls can fight just like the men according to Obama, then they can enjoy a drink or two.  Don’t know what a transported is or why it matters.  USC can stick to the books and the Row should stick to camaraderie its known for.
Pike is #1 in sports, rush, social, brotherhood and dames.  The rest of you are simply bad imitators!

While sitting in her apartment Sunday night, Katie Williams, a junior majoring in philosophy, politics and law, panicked when her roommate told her about a shooting on 24th Street — where her boyfriend lives.
“My heart stopped when I heard that someone I cared about could be in danger,” Williams said. “It truly scared me a lot.”
Though DPS later determined the reporting shooting incident to be an act of vandalism by a BB gun or rock, several students complained about not receiving a message from Trojans Alert, USC’s emergency warning system.
A Trojans Alert message was sent to students at 7:24 p.m. reporting an alleged shooting that occurred on 1155 W. 24th St. on Sunday night at approximately 7 p.m. However, an additional Trojans Alert was sent at approximately 7:35 p.m.
But Williams felt a greater concern. Despite signing up for Trojans Alert as a freshman and receiving texts that year, she did not immediately get the message.
“I don’t understand how USC does so much other work to keep us safe, but cannot get this right,” Williams said. “It seems odd to me that I can’t get a simple text message while I’m a student here.”
DPS Capt. David Carlisle said the Trojans Alert system is functioning well and students most likely did not receive the messages because of human error.
The department has been using Trojans Alert since the 2006-07 school year and, as of November 2012, more than 37,000 students are registered for the emergency system. The system is open to anyone who signs up for it, regardless of relation to the university.
“All students who have registered for Trojans Alert should have received an alert,” Carlisle said. “If a person has changed their phone number, carrier, email address or [if] their inbox is full, they may not receive the alerts.”
Carlisle also pointed out errors in data entry as a possible cause and emphasized the importance of entering information into the system carefully and accurately.
“It is important that all users make sure the information they submitted when registering for TrojansAlert is kept current,” Carlisle said.
Trojans Alert is one of many sources of information students, faculty and staff can use in an emergency.
“There are a variety of sources for alerting the campus to crime,” Carlisle said. “As an example, crimes that constitute an ongoing threat to students, such as a robbery where the suspect has not been caught, are publicized through a crime alert. This is most often in the form of an email.”
Carlisle said Trojans Alert is the best method for accessing information in urgent situations.
“We strongly encourage all students, faculty and staff to register for Trojans Alert,” Carlisle said. “It is the best option available for staying informed in the event of an emergency.”
Carlisle did note, however, that the necessary rapid response of Trojans Alert could sacrifice accuracy.
“Several weeks ago, DPS distributed a Trojans Alert after a person reported being shot at near Exposition Boulevard and Vermont Avenue,” Carlisle said. “However, as we investigated, we determined that the shots were actually a disabled car nearby that was backfiring.”
Students had varying opinions on Trojans Alerts. Anish Patil, a graduate student in the electrical engineering program, believes the process needs to be streamlined.
“When there was a robbery on campus, I actually found out through a meme on Facebook,” Patil said. “I had a phone number registered but I didn’t know where, and when I changed my phone number but didn’t know where.”
Meanwhile, Daniel Garrido, a sophomore majoring in fine arts, said not getting the text didn’t bother him.
“To tell you the truth, I hardly ever pay attention to the alerts. For me, [Trojans Alert] is good to have for students, but it does not bother me whether I get the alerts [or not],” Garrido said.
Some expressed surprise that there were students not receiving the Trojans Alert. Chelsey Christensen, a senior majoring in psychology, said she has not had any problems since signing up for the service.
“I heard about [the reported shooting] through Trojans Alert,” Christensen said. “It’s really interesting that [students] did not get the Trojans Alert because I get them all the time … like four times in an incident. I think it’s important that people know what is going on around them.”
After last night’s scare, Williams signed up for Trojans Alert for a second time.
“I just hope I get the alerts now, “ she said. “I don’t want to think about what would happen if a serious incident happened near me and I didn’t get the text.”

The USC Musical Theatre Repertoire’s production of Sweeney Todd was excellent on all accounts, particularly the performances, set and production design.
Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street is a musical about a barber named Benjamin Barker. At the start of the show, he returns from fifteen years living as a convict in Australia on a trumped-up charge. He returns to London to be told by his downstairs neighbor that his wife is dead and that the man responsible for her suicide has taken his daughter as his ward, causing him to seek his bloody revenge upon those who have wronged his family.
All of the actors in this production were truly impressive. The vocal quality was very high, and the lyrics were all easily discernible. Amanda Griffiths (Beggar Woman), Arielle Fishman (Johanna), and Cole Cuomo (Sweeney Todd) were all notable and performed very well. Tory Stolper as Mrs. Lovett stood out even amongst the rest of the impressive cast: Her acting was very good throughout, particularly the timing of her line delivery, consistent physicality and facial expression. Her vocal performances were also very strong. The most memorable song was probably “A Little Priest,” simply because of the excellent chemistry and camaraderie between Mrs. Lovett and Mr. Todd. That being said, Matthew McFarland’s performance as Judge Turpin in “Johanna: Mea Culpa” was particularly poignant. His voice was full of emotion and conflict and didn’t break awkwardly even when flagellating himself with a very painful-looking whip.
The one inconsistency to note overall was the fluctuation of the accents: It seemed that all of the characters had English accents except for Sweeney, which was slightly off-putting. That being said, those who adopted them were consistent in their use and they were all quite good. Overall, this show was cast very well. The one challenge was the casting of Toby, as the character is supposed to be a young boy; that being said, David Nicholson was very good in the role, particularly at the very end of the show in the bake house.
The ensemble is also worth noting. Their voices were all strong, contributing to the smooth flow of the production. They were good at controlling the pace of the show, while also increasing the tension and wariness of the audience in numbers such as “God! That’s Good” at the beginning of Act 2 and “Pirelli’s Miracle Elixir” halfway through Act 1. One of the oddities of Sweeney Todd is that the ensemble proposes to tell you his tale at the beginning of the show, which means the musical is bookended with an introduction and a conclusion. That being said, the conclusion in particular was very striking and left the show on a very powerful note.
The choreography was also very well thought-out. There were several entrances and exits to the stage that one often wouldn’t notice until they were used. The aisle between the sides of the audience wasn’t overused, but was used enough and to good effect to bring the audience into the action. There were a number of ensemble pieces where so many people in such a small space could have been overwhelming, but it was blocked very well and there were no awkward bumps between actors. The most striking choreography was perhaps in “City on Fire”, where the ensemble and the blocking did a really good job of increasing up the tension in the theatre and picking up the pace of the show.
The set was very cleverly put together, particularly given the odd requirements of the show and the small space in which the actors had to work. The Massman is uncomfortably small at the best of times, and yet this set worked very well with the musical. It was composed of two levels, each side segmented away to be a different set. Each ‘room’ was its own distinct space, and the main sets for the show (Mr. Todd’s barber shop, Mrs. Lovett’s pie shop, and Johanna’s room) were not used for any other scenes. This made the show and its movements very easy to follow. The most ingenious piece, though, was the trap that led from Sweeney’s chair in the second act. His victims would literally slide out of the chair and down onto the floor behind a curtain. The scene transitions and prop movements were good in their speed and relative subtlety, although there were a couple of mishaps with Mrs. Lovett’s pie counter.
The costumes were dark with a gothic Victorian style that complimented the tone of the show and the design of the set. The splashes of color granted to Mrs. Lovett and Sweeney Todd were interesting but not out of place, though the one white sleeve of Mr. Todd’s costume did strike one as odd at first. The makeup matched the fairly black-and-white visual scheme, with many faces looking wan and dark shadows put under the eyes of the characters. This added to the slightly unhealthy and deranged atmosphere of the world in which the play functions.
Overall, MTR’s production of Sweeney Todd was of a very high standard on all accounts. It was impressive enough to elicit a desire to attend their future productions, presuming they are of the same calibre as this strikingly dark and poignant musical.

“The cool thing about science,” astrophysicist Neil deGrasse Tyson told a capacity crowd at Bovard Auditorium on Monday, “is that it’s true whether you believe in it or not.”
Far out · Neal de Grasse-Tyson talks to students about the beginning of the universe and the possible destruction of the world by asteriods. – Chris Pham | Daily Trojan
 
Tyson, who holds degrees from Harvard and Columbia, walked on stage without shoes and promptly asked that the lights be turned up so that he could better interact with his audience. Within seconds, he had set the tone of the event, hosted by Program Board Speakers Committee, Academic Cultural Assembly and USC Spectrum, as casual and interactive.
The atmosphere makes sense, given Tyson’s role as a public advocate of science, which will be more apparent as he hosts the reboot of Carl Sagan’s Cosmos this year. Many know him as the host of PBS’s NOVA from 2005-11 or as the snarky scientist who told director James Cameron that a star in the night sky of Titanic would not have been visible in 1912. He’s also one of the most famous scientists on Twitter, with nearly 1 million followers, and he uses his social media clout to encourage interest in exploring the natural world.
As a public figure in the scientific community, Tyson was not afraid to directly call out America, which he jokingly called “’Murrica,” for inadequate funding toward scientific research or perpetuation of psuedo-science as science. He refrains, however, from pushing his knowledge on others.
“I just provide both ways and leave the rest to [the people],” Tyson said.
After all, Tyson sees his role as an educator to the masses. In an interview with the Daily Trojan before the presentation, Tyson said his main objective is simply to make people curious about the natural world. The public matters most to Tyson because it elects its leadership, and he said he declined to serve as NASA’s director based on this principle.
“As director [of NASA], I would report to the president,” Tyson said. “But as a citizen, the president reports to me as it is.”
For Tyson, the key to an America full of educated, creative innovators is to encourage scientific interest and critical thought in the public sphere. His enthusiam in promoting that goal showed at Monday’s event, with his witty and direct dialogue helping keep the audience inspired.
“It’s just you and me tonight,” Tyson quipped at the begginning of the talk, eliciting relaxed laughs from the crowd.
Tyson also used real-world examples to make points about critical thinking. In one instance, he presented the “Face on Mars” photograph, a low-resolution picture taken in the ’70s that seems to depict a face on the planet Mars.
“Most life on Earth does not have a face,” Tyson said. “[Assuming that the Face on Mars was some kind of signal] is a profound absence of imagination.”
And though Tyson might be open to the fact that people believe in science to varying degrees, it didn’t stop him from taking some well-timed digs.
“That makes sense for people for whom evidence doesn’t matter,” he said of the Face on Mars.
Tyson also pointed out that  the United States has more creationists than other developed countries, sometimes making it tricky for scientists like himself to work
“The universe is hard enough,” Tyson said. “In my field, you tell it like it is!”
But besides explaining how science is misunderstood, Tyson inspired the same enthusiasm he shows for the natural world to the rapt audience.
After poignantly explaining how the most common elements found in the universe are also the most common elements found in the human body, Tyson ended the talk with an image containing an uncountable number of stars.
“Not only do we exist in the universe,” Tyson said. “The universe exists in us.”
[Correction: A previous version of this article indicated that the event was hosted by USC Spectrum. The event was hosted by  Program Board Speakers Committee, Academic Cultural Assembly and USC Spectrum. The Daily Trojan regrets the error.]
A wonderful night!

AD Pat Haden has promised to turn the USC men’s basketball program into a winner — and we should believe in him.
The first issue that should be noted is that Haden was appointed athletic director in August 2010. As such, he inherited a basketball team in the throes of self-imposed sanctions related to the NCAA violations surrounding O.J. Mayo in 2007-08. The Trojans were docked one scholarship for two years in a sport that routinely sees top recruits leave for the NBA after a single season at the college level. Recruiting itself was made increasingly difficult because of a 20-day truncation of the recruiting season, another condition of the self-imposed sanctions.
Furthermore, though the timing of former USC coach Kevin O’Neill’s firing might have come as a surprise, it opened the door for speculation with regard to the basketball program’s future. The firing itself was never really in question and had been speculated since last August, when ESPN LA reported that O’Neill had sold his downtown condo and moved 125 miles south to Coronado. Though O’Neill insisted that the move would not affect his coaching responsibilities, many saw it as a sign that O’Neill was not confident in the team’s ability to deliver on what had become a bubble of expectations, inflated by the acquisition of highly touted transfers such as junior guard J.T. Terrell and junior center Omar Oraby.
O’Neill was replaced by Cantu, who will have the rest of the season to make a case for his head coaching candidacy. Should he receive the position, he will have an opportunity to continue recruiting for the Trojans. Cantu’s recruiting track record has been solid over the course of his career, including signings of Trojan standouts Nick Young, Taj Gibson, Mayo and DeMar DeRozan. Cantu’s recommendations of other potential standouts were eventually vetoed by head coaches; one such player was Klay Thompson, who ultimately landed at Washington State and is now starting for the NBA’s Golden State Warriors. If Cantu is given full rein to recruiting responsibilities, building a strong program could just be a matter of time.
Finally, the truest test of Haden’s ability to make good on his word to strengthen the basketball program has yet to come: the decision of either hiring a new head coach or retaining Cantu, which can be made easier or more difficult depending on how the Trojans finish this season. To assert that Haden is unable to deliver on his word at any point before then would be premature.
Stinging losses, such as the one suffered Saturday night to Arizona, might linger in the mind, but before the Trojan faithful break out pitchforks and torches, it’s important to hold the right people accountable. In this case, Haden is not culpable for the basketball team’s performance –— yet.
Instead, it is far more likely that Haden is thinking with the men’s basketball program’s long-term interest in mind. Constructing a top-tier basketball program doesn’t get underway without a little initial demolition work, and Haden’s firing of Kevin O’Neill was one step in the right direction. Whether Haden takes the next step forward and hires the right architect to draft a blueprint for success remains to be seen.

The lackluster history of USC men’s basketball should quell any hopes of a return to national prominence.
Since its basketball program began back in 1922, USC has made the NCAA tournament just 16 times. Yes, 16 times in 91 years. So in any given season, the Trojans have less than a one-in-four chance to make the postseason.
They’ve been the regular-season champion of their conference only seven times, most recently in 1985. They’ve won their conference tournament once, in 2009. And their last Final Four appearance? You’d have to go all the way back to 1954, when the NCAA tournament field only consisted of 24 teams.
Why does any of this matter?
Because besides lacking historical draw, USC has also done a poor job of recruiting, especially as of late.
According to Rivals’ ratings system, USC’s last five-star recruit was DeMar DeRozan in 2008. Meanwhile, their last two four-star recruits have either transferred in their first season (Bryce Jones in 2011) or underachieved (J.T. Terrell).
For USC to turn their men’s basketball program around, they need to stop heavily recruiting three-star recruits and junior college transfers. It’s almost impossible to yield a tournament team in a major conference without top-tier talent.
In this day and age, most four- and five-star recruits focus on a few factors when choosing a school: the program’s history, their chances of advancing deep in the NCAA tournament, their playing time and the coach’s ability to prepare them for the next level.
At this point, USC can only offer players one of those opportunities (you can guess which one). And the biggest hindrance of all, which is the most difficult to deal with pride wise, is the fact USC’s crosstown rival, the UCLA Bruins, are almost always going to have the first pick in local and national recruits.
Just as USC has dominated the college football recruiting landscape in Southern California, UCLA has done the same on the hardwood. Since DeRozan’s departure to the NBA, UCLA has had three five-star recruits and eight four-star recruits. That’s something the Trojans could only dream of.
As the Trojans continue their search for a coach, this much is clear: They need to hire a top-notch coach who not only employs a player-friendly and successful style of basketball, but can also recruit upper-echelon players. It sounds simple, but who fits the bill?
There are certain names floating around the rumor mill, and a few attractive options, but no one has the pizzazz needed to drastically shift USC’s reputation in a short amount of time.
It’ll take another five years or so, at the least, to turn the program around from the doldrums of the 2010 sanctions and the turmoil of having three different head coaches in a span of less than four years. It’s possible, but not probable. The past does not dictate the future, but it can help predict it. If the USC men’s basketball team’s historic struggles are any indication, we can expect history to repeat itself.
Jovan Buha is a junior majoring in print journalism.
Coach Bibby got fired under Mike Garrett before we got hit with sanctions, maybe because Bibby was a clean coach who cared about eduction and winning… Bibby is now with the NBA Memphis Grizzlies and the team is doing great, and I am sure time in both college as a player/coach, and now NBA from player to coach he has even more to offer.  Bibby added passion, and excitement to USC… Bring Bibby Back!
Uh, ever hear of one-and-done in college basketball?  If USC does not/cannot attract a steady stream of talented players, we will NEVER be competitive in basketball.  Blame the NBA, not Haden, for the lousy situation in college basketball.
After reading both points, all i read is that you’ve done some research (probably Widipedia) into the history books and watched a few games this season.  Don’t talk about lack of history.  We’ve had great teams that were screwed over by the NCAA selection committee.  Why don’t you talk about how Boyd was the foundation of the USC Basketball program and seek answers on how to take us back to those type of glory days.  You don’t offer solutions.  You’re just whiney complainers.  Buha mentions “names floating around” for a new coach.  If you’re a real journalist, then do your research and tell the readers who they are and who you “KNOW” will be the next coach…or even speculate.  This is the last time I read a Daily Trojan article.  Amateur!

The transition was never going to be seamless. That was quite evident last Saturday in Tucson, Ariz., as the USC men’s basketball team was run off the court by No. 8 Arizona in front of a sold-out McKale Center crowd.
Less than 10 minutes in, the Trojans trailed 18-4, plagued by six quick turnovers. Things never got better. They would eventually fall by a final score of 74-50. It was the fewest points they’ve scored in a game all season- -— which is saying something — and so they dropped to 1-3 under USC interim head coach Bob Cantu, who replaced Kevin O’Neill just two weeks ago.
Yes, this much became clear: The move from O’Neill to Cantu isn’t going to be an easy one at all.
The state of the program, really, couldn’t have looked any worse at Arizona. No matter the records, matchups versus top-10 foes serve as measuring sticks and USC looked as if it didn’t belong in the same building — just two nights removed, mind you, after taking 16-win Arizona State to overtime.
The Trojans were as bad as they’ve been all season Saturday: inept on offense and seemingly disinterested in playing any sort of defense as the Wildcats reeled off 39 first-half points before easing up on the gas pedal, resulting in the relatively respectable final score.
Of course, this latest stretch of games raises the rather obvious question: Why didn’t that head coaching switch come sooner?
Of the four teams USC has played during Cantu’s brief tenure thus far, three of them — Arizona, Arizona State and Oregon — are poised to make the NCAA tournament. Currently, the three teams are a combined 51-8. And the Wildcats and Ducks are ranked in the top 25, so it hasn’t exactly been the warmest of welcomes for Cantu. Not to mention the Trojans will travel to Pauley Pavilion on Wednesday to face rival UCLA (16-5).
This is why that KO-to-Cantu handoff should’ve come around Christmas, after the 61-54 loss to UC Irvine on Dec. 20 or after the 64-56 defeat at Georgia on Dec. 22. The Trojans, already an odd mix of transfers from other Division I schools to junior colleges, could have used the holiday break as a time to adjust to a new coach and have at least one game (Dayton on Dec. 30) to grow accustomed to an altered style of play and new offensive and defensive wrinkles before conference play began.
This is all hindsight, of course. But if USC was dead set on firing O’Neill at some point by midseason as a last-ditch attempt to save the season, it, frankly, needed to come earlier — not a week before a three-game conference road trip, with stops in Tucson, Ariz. and at Pauley Pavilion.
Cantu, of course, won’t talk in those hypothetical terms.
“I can’t say that,” he said Sunday, when I asked if he regretted not getting the chance to take over sooner. “You have no control. I had no idea this was going to happen.”
No regrets, I guess.
“This is just kind of how the schedule worked out. That’s just how it goes. We just have to be prepared,” Cantu said.
But the Trojans don’t look like they’re prepared, not nearly enough. They look like they’re mid-transition, and the timing for that is far from ideal with the grueling conference slate. To date, they’ve had just four full practices in preparation for four games under the interim head coach.
“You’re preparing for a team, and you still don’t have everything [installed] that you’d like to have,” Cantu admitted.
Under O’Neill, this team was full of grinders, as the former NBA assistant preached a tough-minded defensive style. Under Cantu, at least thus far, they’ve been gunners, hoisting a total of 48 3-pointers during their last two games against Arizona and Arizona State. And as was the case Saturday, sometimes those don’t fall.
Now Cantu searches for that happy medium, somewhere between the two contrasting styles: hard-nosed defense and an up-tempo offense. But the pressing dilemma is that he already might be running out of time to get it just right.
By this point, USC (8-13, 3-5) will have a tough time even securing a bid to the National Invitation Tournament, in what would be its first appearance in the postseason tournament since 1999. With 10 regular-season games left to go, they’ll need to finish 8-2 just to have a winning record overall and 7-3 to even finish above -.500 in conference play. And though the NIT is essentially college basketball’s consolation tournament, teams do need to have more wins than losses — though not necessarily by much: Iowa, at 17-16, made the NIT’s field of 32 a season ago.
And really, it would be in the program’s best interest to be playing in a postseason tournament. They need to collect wins, to grow as a group. After all, they’ve lost more than 40 times in a two-year span.
But this is the reality of a mid-season coaching switch, and one that occurred after conference play began. There isn’t much time. They might not get that chance.
“My goal, in this whole thing, is to be playing our best basketball at the end of February and in March,” Cantu said.  “Then go from there.”
By then, it might become a moot point.

The USC men’s tennis team has just begun what promises to be a long, demanding season, epitomized by only a two-day break in between matches this week. After a successful ITA Kick-Off Weekend tournament, the No. 2 Trojans immediately began preparing for a doubleheader against the No. 57 Cal Poly Mustangs and the UC Irvine Anteaters to be played today at Marks Stadium.

This weekend, USC defeated San Diego State, 4-0, to advance to the ITA Kick-Off Weekend championship, in which they defeated Fresno State, 4-0. As soon as the match was over, the Trojans had to put the weekend behind them and start thinking about their next match.
USC coach Peter Smith acknowledged the fast turnaround — the first of many — describing the team’s schedule as “a little intense this year,” given the high volume of games.
According to junior Emilio Gomez, the quick succession of matches is actually good for the team.
“We’re just trying to get our rhythm back,” Gomez said. “We actually want to get a lot of matches in, so we can really start improving our game.”
USC will open its doubleheader today against Cal Poly. The Mustangs (2-1) are led by first-year coach Nick Carless. Earlier in the season, they had success in a tournament at Fresno State, where they defeated Saint Mary’s, 5-2. In the next round, they upset Fresno State, 4-1. At the time, the Bulldogs were ranked No. 50 in the nation, while Cal Poly sat at No. 62. Leading the upset was senior Andre Dome, who is currently the No. 89 singles player in the country.
His singles and doubles victories in that match earned him the title of Big West Men’s Tennis Athlete of the Week.
Smith says Cal Poly’s upset of Fresno State hasn’t affected the team’s training or mindset leading up to their match.
“All of these matches, really, in my eyes, are a form of practice,” Smith said. “And that’s not to say disrespect to our opponents. Really, we’re all playing toward something bigger: conference championships [and] national championships.”
In the second match of the day, USC will take on the Anteaters of UC Irvine (0-3). After losing a match at home to Nevada 6-1, the Anteaters traveled to Honolulu to take on Hawai’i and Sacramento State. They fell to Hawai’i 5-2, and lost to Sacramento State the next day 6-1.
The Anteaters are led by junior Ryan Cheung, who was named to the All-Big West second team in doubles for the 2011-12 season. UCI coach Trevor Kronemann is in his sixth season with the team.
UCI is currently unranked and has no players ranked in either singles or doubles, but the team isn’t letting its guard down.
“It’s important not to overlook these teams,” junior Ray Sarmiento said. “The guys need to take care of their own matches and the rest will come.”
Sarmiento, USC’s highest-ranked singles player, will sit out the doubleheader today because of a slight abdominal injury but will be back in action against Texas on Friday.
USC kicks off its doubleheader today against Cal Poly at 12:30 p.m. The team then faces UCI at 4:30 p.m. Both matches are set to be played at Marks Stadium.

The USC women’s tennis team triumphed once again this weekend at the ITA Kick-Off, earning a victory over Akron in the opening match and later a win over UC Irvine in the finals. The Women of Troy entered the tournament with a No. 4 national ranking and did nothing to hurt that standing, easily defeating both opponents at the tournament.
Holding serve · In addition to her doubles win with sophomore Giuliana Olmos, senior Danielle Lao won her finals singles match 6-1, 6-4. – Joseph Chen | Daily Trojan
In the opening match on Saturday, USC defeated the Akron Zips in quick fashion. Nineteenth-ranked sophomore Zoë Scandalis set the tone with a 6-1, 6-2 victory on court one.  Senior Valeria Pulido followed that with an equally impressive 6-2, 6-1 victory, and sophomore newcomer Giuliana Olmos wrapped up the first wave of singles matches with a one-sided 6-1, 6-0 win.
Junior Kaitlyn Christian was able to clinch the victory for the Women of Troy in leading the second wave of singles matches. Playing at the No. 6 spot, Christian was near flawless in a 6-1, 6-0 victory. Her win earned the Trojans a berth in the championship game on Sunday against the UC Irvine Anteaters.
This marks the second time the Women of Troy have squared off against the Anteaters this season, as the two met nearly two weeks ago for USC’s season opener.
USC took that match without dropping a single set and were hoping to do much of the same in this match with a spot to the ITA National Team Indoor Championship on the line. Both teams tinkered with their lineups, but at the end of the day, the Women of Troy were once again simply too dominant for the Anteaters.
The tone was set during the doubles portion of the match, with the lethal combination of Christian and sophomore Sabrina Santamaria leading the way. In addition, senior standout Danielle Lao paired with Olmos to make quick work of their opponents and give USC the doubles point in less than half-an-hour of play.
Singles play in the finals went just as well for the Women of Troy. Christian again was extremely impressive. Playing out of the  No. 4 spot, she made quick work of her opponent en route to a 6-1, 6-1 win. Olmos played out of the No. 3 spot and racked up a 6-3, 6-0 victory to give the Trojans a 3-0 lead in the match.
That left the clinching point up for grabs between Scandalis, Lao and freshman Ellie Yates. All three played well and were in position to win, but at the end of the match, it was the senior, Lao, who came up with a winner first and clinched the berth to the ITA National tournament for USC. Though Yates and Scandalis were close to the ends of their matches, both games were suspended because of weather conditions that had delayed all matches over the weekend.
Inclement weather aside, the ITA National Team Indoors competition will occur next month in Charlottesville, Va. USC has never won the tournament, but the team’s performance should be a good indicator of where it stands in comparison to other top teams in the country. Since the tournament’s first year in 1988, 14 national champions have either won or been a runner-up in the tournament.
The Women of Troy stand 3-0 overall (the record excludes split team tournament play) and will continue their 2013 campaign with two matches this week. First, on Thursday, the Trojans will make a short trip to Malibu for a match with the Pepperdine Waves. The team will return to Marks Stadium on Saturday for a battle with the Fresno State Bulldogs.

As I looked around my friend’s East Coast dorm room, something caught my eye — or rather, the absence of something. It was an item that I had taken for granted, an item that I presumed every college student — at least, female college student — was in possession of.
A costume box.
Apparently party boxes ran next to none at my friend’s frigid New England university, and I soon realized that USC was rare in its abundance of themed parties permeating our nightlife.
Frat parties, sorority invites, even small kickbacks at Gateway all have their themes. After all, isn’t it way more fun to dress up in some ridiculous costume than to try too hard to look “hot”?
As we all know by now, partying isn’t all the school has to offer: USC is an excellent university with above par academics and sports. But our social lives are a big part of our college experience, so it’s important to think about how we portray ourselves when we go out, especially to themed parties. Other people can form an opinion about us at the drop of a hat, after all, and a costume can speak volumes.
Every time a big themed party rolls around, I promise myself that I’ll have a really kick-ass costume — something that makes everyone stop in their tracks and say, “Girl, you are hilarious!”
Unfortunately, I always leave it until the last minute and end up going as some kind of mouse/cat/devil of some sort.
But when I walk out and look around, I feel like I’ve been dropped into the Twilight Zone of promiscious college kids. I know in Mean Girls they say that Halloween is the one day of the year that you can dress like a slut and no one will care, but that’s not really true. Those people who are saying that you look beautiful? There’s a good chance they’re lying — you probably look ridiculous.
(On that note, when did it become OK for girls to dress up as Sexy Bert and Ernie? It’s not OK. It will never be OK. Leave puppets/cartoons/animals alone. They’re supposed to be for kids! And kids are immediately an off-limits topic with regard to the word “sexy.”)
There are ways to look attractive without stooping for the same old “sexy” strategy. The main problem that people run into is buying their costumes from an actual costume place: Don’t do it. That police woman costume looks horrible and cheap, not to mention unoriginal; instead, hit up a thrift store or the Salvation Army to put together an outfit that looks great and will actually impress. American Apparel even offers a booklet that shows you what pieces to buy to create your dream costume. Pretty ballerina? Check. The elements? Check. A group of highlighters? Check. Over-the-top sexiness doesn’t make you the coolest girl in the room, it just makes you seem a bit desperate.
And guys: Just because you spend eight hours at the gym consuming Jacked all day doesn’t mean that we want to see your ripped abs all the time. Leave something to the imagination. I’m sure I’m not the only one who believes that sexiness constitutes more than baring it all in a narcissistic sort of way (it’s even worse when you don’t have the body to pull it off — there’s nothing wrong with dressing for your body type).
Yet sexy isn’t the only way that you can be offensive. You can just be plain offensive in your attire. Around the world party? Maybe don’t dress up as a Geisha: Race is a tricky issue, and it’s not up to you to show the world how tolerant you are by dressing up in stereotypical costumes. We all like the idea of cowboys and indians and donning a cool ninja costume, but we forget about all of the awkward that can ruin the fun. And though dressing up as Jesus, a nun or a priest cracks up a lot of people — including me — it is also incredibly hurtful to many. Sacrificing the happiness of others to get a laugh is not the way to go.
Instead, try and find a way to get some laughs without going too far. A friend decided to put an Airhead on her forehead and be an “air head.” Another decided to go as the little kid from Up and he couldn’t keep the girls off of him. Ted? Instant classic. Trust me, people will respond more to a clever costume than anything else.
But then there’s the problem of over/under dressing. You’re supposed to be overdressed, but this isn’t the real world. In college, nothing is worse than being overdressed. Show up to a formal invite in a Sunday brunch shirt? Fine. Show up to a casual party looking like you are heading to a club in Vegas? Not fine. If you want to look like a freshman going to their first party, then by all means, dress up hardcore. If you want to look like you know what you’re doing, however, take it a bit easy. I’m not saying give up on all accounts (as in, don’t be like me and wear sweats to the 9-0), but you should be able to show that you’re a cool, interesting person without limping in heels or constantly loosening a tie.
So what have we learned here? You can look attractive without being crazy promiscious, you can be funny without being offensive and being overdressed is the equivalent of walking around with a spotlight saying “See, I have no life, it took me three hours to get ready!”
True “hotness” is achieved through effortless endeavors. Notice Scarlett Johannsen or Mila Kunis or Chris Hemsworth or Ryan Gosling. They’re constantly voted the sexiest people alive because it’s quite obvious that they simply don’t give a damn. Desperation is a turn-off. Instead, try to be the best you that you can be. Themed parties are a time to have some fun, not to spend too much time worrying about sex appeal.
And however you decide to dress to go out, make sure that it’s something you’re not going to regret later on. Though your memories of the night may be a bit hazy, those Facebook photos will live forever, for better or worse.

The Misadventures of Rick the Strangler, running through Feb. 10 at the Electric Lodge in Venice, focuses on a hit man struggling to properly divide his attention between his career, his prostitute girlfriend and his beloved dog, Amos. And get this: it’s a comedy!

Written and directed by USC alumnus Brian Peterson, this play has it all: blood, severed fingers, betrayal, a sequence straight out of a blaxploitation film and even a musical number. Peterson’s script strikes an impressive balance between shocking darkness, Will Ferrell-esque jokes and heartfelt sincerity. At times, the liberal use of the F-word may seem juvenile or excessive, but this is quickly made up for by ridiculous one-liners such as, “I take 3-minute power naps with one eye at a time,” or “Sherlock? Apparently he’s some badass detective from Brit-land.” In addition, Peterson’s dialogue for Rick (especially about Amos) demonstrates that a dark comedy is perfectly capable of emotional depth and that even a hit man can deserve the audience’s empathy. Peterson’s expertise comes through in the carefully constructed climax — it’s an adrenaline rush accompanied by a bevy of emotion that will leave viewers reeling.
This production owes the bulk of its success to Jonathan Brooks, who is an absolute spark plug as Rick. It’s sort of mind-boggling that this is his L.A. theatre debut — this portrayal should earn him plenty of future roles. His commitment to Rick’s manic energy is unwavering; though the plot can be a little unbelievable, Brooks never is. In dealing with his dog or less-than-classy girlfriend, he is gentle and earnest (even if he has trouble saying “I love you”), but when it comes to the cops or his underhanded boss, he yells until his neck veins throb and his face turns crimson. He even shows considerable charm as a dancer and singer.
As Rick’s girlfriend Tina, Irina Costa is appropriately bimbo-esque and carries out her main objective — looking like a hooker — with poise. Just as Rick experiences, the audience won’t have any trouble finding Tina attractive, but falling in love with her might be a little hard. After all, she is rather unlikable: she’s a headstrong dimwit who nearly destroys Rick’s life because of her hatred and jealousy of Amos. She also gets a little too whiny with Rick — didn’t she know what she was getting into when she started dating a guy named Rick the Strangler? Costa does have a few bright moments in the play, however, such as when she’s trying to convince everyone that she has quit prostitution and become a doctor: She enters in a naughty nurse Halloween costume.
The real love of Rick’s life, Amos, is brought to life by James Zimmerman, who walks upright and wears a dog suit and painted black nose a la the titular character on FX’s Wilfred. In the program, Zimmerman acknowledges the director’s dog, Enzo, for “being a constant inspiration during the rehearsal process.” Zimmerman must have studied canine behavior extensively, because he absolutely nails his part. For the majority of the play, his lines are limited to one-word exclamations: “No!” “What?!” “Hello!” His behavior reflects the extreme single-mindedness of pet dogs; he’s either completely focused on his food, on watching Rick, on protecting the house or just contentedly staring off into space — there is no in-between.
This is why it comes as a remarkably pleasant surprise when Amos halts the action at the height of the play’s climax and delivers a lucid monologue in full sentences about the nature of the relationship between man and dog. It’s full of insight into the triumph of love over obstacles despite imperfections, and Zimmerman steals the show.
Also delightful are performances by Trip Davis as Lenny, a geekier John Cusack-type with the voice of Stewie from Family Guy who happens to be another hitman; Rhomeyn Johnson as Mr. Paul, Rick’s scary boss who can really rock a purple suit; and especially Michael Geary as Duane, Tina’s bumbling rookie cop older brother, who possesses stellar comedic timing and rightfully earns most of the audience’s laughs.
A final noteworthy aspect of the production is the set, designed by Peterson, Davis and Antoine Villaume. The first act of the play takes place in Rick’s convincingly dingy apartment, replete with stained wallpaper and mismatched furniture. At the top of act two, the actors transform the space by folding the top half of the back wall down to reveal a painted to resemble a short brick wall that creates the rooftop setting for the rest of the scenes. It might seem like a simple change, but it makes the production design  considerably more sophisticated.
Visiting the Electric Lodge is exciting in itself; just a block away from hipster-haven Abbot Kinney Boulevard in Venice, this solar-powered and eco-friendly arts space is full of Los Angeles’ trendiest folk, so be sure to look the part.
Rick the Strangler is funny enough to entertain you and complex enough to stay on the audience’s mind for days after the play has ended. And though the play is an offbeat misadventure, it’s also an experience well worth the time.

If you walk down the corner of Western Avenue and Wilshire Boulevard any time in the next few days, look up — at the top of a building to the north, a mural of a giant Buddha will greet your eyes. Surrounded by graffiti swirls and a purple background, the tranquil, blue Buddha sits with eyes closed. That creation comes from the talent of Eric Skotnes, a Los Angeles-based artist.
In memoriam · This mural was made in honor of Eric Skotnes’ wife’s son Phillip DeMars, who battled cancer in 2009. Skotnes called DeMars very spiritual and based the mural off a Buddha statue in DeMar’s backyard. – Courtesy of Michael LaCourte
Skotnes began doing graffiti at the age of 16 and often rode his bicycle to the Los Angeles River to gaze at murals. Eventually, his bus rides to work became a means to meeting the artists behind these works, and they invited him to come along to paint walls with them. After many years of graffiti, Skotnes decided to take his talent to the next level; he asked a building owner in Eagle Rock permission to create a large, legal work.
“I asked if I could paint his wall because it was always being tagged,” Skotnes said. “He invited me into his studio — I didn’t know he was an artist — and he ended up being the amazing painter, Steve Huston. He told me, ‘If you want to paint the wall, I’ll give you figurative lessons in exchange.’”
Huston’s work includes many figurative oil paintings of boxers with detailed muscle structure, which resonated deeply with Skotness. Huston’s work instilled within  Skotness a a deep desire to do more with his art and expand his horizons beyond the usual graffiti work he had done.
With the encouragement and support of his father, Terry, Skotnes attended the Art Center College of Design in Pasadena for illustration. After attending art school, his style continued to flourish; “Awakenings” proves the culmination of an artistic journey as well as a personal one.
“Originally, my graffiti was all about making a name for myself in that world — bigger and better was my motto -— but now I have a responsibility to send a message with my art. I want it to be better and deeper, you could say that’s my new mantra,” Skotnes said. “A colorful piece with my writer’s name just doesn’t intrigue me anymore.”
It’s why Skotnes decided to create the mural of Buddha for SoulPancake. Aside from the Rainn Wilson book of the same name, SoulPancake as a site featured a series called “Art Attack,” in which artists create a piece and viewers can watch a timelapse video of the process. Skotnes boasts various shows at galleries like Thinkspace and the recently closed Crewest; after a friend suggested him for SoulPancake, Skotnes decided to pursue a large-scale project.
The finished product, completed in September 2012, serves as more than an aesthetically pleasing work, and Skotnes said he knew exactly what piece he wanted to create.
“I wanted to honor my wife’s son Phillip [DeMars], who passed away in 2009, by painting one of his favorite spiritual icons. We made his backyard into a meditation garden and in that garden, there was a Buddha statue. I spent many hours sitting and drawing the amazing statue,” Skotnes said. “I had also painted a mural on the back of his cottage, and my wife and I agreed that it would be beautiful to mix the two elements.”
Skotnes met his wife, recording artist Rebekah Del Rio, during the time her son Phillip DeMars struggled with cancer. The artist met DeMars only a few months before he passed away, but DeMars serves as the inspiration for the spray-painted mural, which Skotnes named “Awakenings.”
“Basically, in the four years he was battling cancer, he became very spiritual and he had an awakening that we believed helped him to be at peace with his illness,” Skotnes said. “I feel it’s important to share his story but I do like to also suggest that we don’t have to go through a fight with cancer to become awakened, mindful, positive and more grateful for everything around us. We should all try not to be so negative about all the bad things or the wrong in our lives.”
Regardless of whether a viewer knows the story behind the mural, the Buddha and graffiti style come together in a peacefulness that requires no backstory.
“I wanted to marry the negative with the positive in my mural,” Skotnes said. “Graffiti carries a negative connotation. People tend to think of graffiti as bad and destructive because of gangs and tagging, whereas the Buddha, regardless of what religion you subscribe to, is a positive, spiritually meditative symbol for most people. I wanted to incorporate those two as one of a kind — like the yin and yang of life.”

Two hundred and thirty-one years ago, Deborah Sampson enlisted in the 4th Massachusetts Regiment as a light infantry soldier, taking a saber to the side of the head and two musket balls to the thigh and consequently receiving an honorable discharge for her service in the American Revolution under George Washington. Jennie Hodgers, 152 years ago, began service in the 95th Illinois Infantry and fought in over 40 skirmishes and battles, including the Siege of Vicksburg.
Daniel Razzano | Daily Trojan
 
In the past century, there have been no Deborah Sampsons or Jennie Hodgerses making waves in the military sphere. Aside from being taboo, women were simply not officially assigned to combat zones.
Not anymore.
Last week, the Pentagon announced that it would repeal the 1994 ban that prevented women from serving in combat.
This most recent shift in Pentagon policy caps a process that has been years in the making. Historically, women have served in countless non-combative positions such as nurses, pilots and maintenance staff. Since then, Secretary of Defense Les Aspin’s 1994 directive declared women “eligible to be assigned to all positions for which they are qualified, except that women shall be excluded from assignments … whose primary mission is direct combat on the ground.”
That said, anyone who opposes Leon Panetta and the Joint Chief’s decision to repeal this rule seriously misunderstands the nature of warfare in the modern world. Four hundred nurses died in World War I, 88 women were held as POWs in World War II and 152 women have died in the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. The nature of modern war means that danger no longer exists solely in infantry combat.
Arguments against lifting restrictions largely fail to provide compelling and logical reasons to exclude women from combat positions. Some former commanders have argued that factors like pregnancy and romantic jealousy can hamper the effectiveness of a mission. Though these might be possibilities, they are not probabilities.
Fights among male soldiers are just as common, showing us that gender segregation will not solve inter-military conflict. Women should be excluded from military combat positions if they exhibit detrimental and inappropriate behavior, but women should not be excluded because of their sex.
Some argue that it is simply a matter of physical capability. Ambreea Dills, a former National Guard soldier, said, “There’s no way that a woman can carry the same weight that a man can.” She might be right, but her argument is a non sequitur. For one, it is outlandish to assert that a woman who makes it through basic training and fights on the front lines will always perform worse than a male soldier at any given combat-related task. Additionally, it isn’t about who can lift more, run faster or jump higher relative to other soldiers. What matters is that all of our soldiers perform not only with physical competency, but also mental dexterity, which countless women have proven they can do.
The move to allow women equal opportunity in the armed forces follows in the footsteps of greater equality for homosexuals (in both the civil and armed forces sectors), women in the workforce, immigrants and a host of other minority groups previously marginalized by society.
The American government’s priority should be to ensure equal rights for all, and part of that means allowing both capable men and women to serve our country in the way they best can. Whether or not one agrees with President Barack Obama’s politics, it is undeniable that allowing women to fight in our armed forces stands as a large step toward promoting a meritocracy for our troops.

Every time you turn on your TV, it appears as if another corporate villain is being put away in the big house for fraud, extortion or perjury. Bear Stearns. Refco. AIG: All of these business’ honchos are still feeling the wrath of the law and the public. With the Occupy Wall Street protests dominating the streets of New York and our media for most of the summer, the public’s distrust and hate of the business world is palpable. 
So two kinds of reactions exist when people learn of your summer internship at an investment banking firm or consulting company. Members of the first group, well-versed in the Forbes 500 and largely composed of business students as well, are impressed and envious. The other group will congratulate you, possibly fake a smile and internally label you a corporate sell-out.
In our society, the career options of finance or investment banking have become synonymous with cash-hungry and profit-driven. There is nothing noble about a career in a corporate setting, people assume. According to many, if you’ve chosen business as a career option, you have essentially sold your soul to your briefcase.
The truth is, at least some of that perception is accurate. It’s no secret that the business world is tough and unrelenting. The competition is intense and ultimately, your worth in a business setting boils down to one thing: Are you making your company money? Far more important than your passions, convictions and interests, do your abilities factor favorably into the bottom line? Are you a good investment? Are you profitable?
Despite this, business majors with a conscience have good reason to be hopeful. According to Whole Foods Market co-founder John Mackey, the tide has begun to turn. “Conscious capitalism,” a term coined by Mackey in his new book Conscious Capitalism: Liberating the Heroic Spirit of Business, is rapidly becoming a new corporate norm. Mackey argues that business, like any field, can have a positive impact as long as businesses are conscious of their actions and maintain a “shared value” to society. In his book, Mackey ambitiously states that “business is good because it creates value, it is ethical because it is based on voluntary exchange, it is noble because it can elevate our existence, and it is heroic because it lifts people out of poverty and creates prosperity.” To support his argument, he lists popular and successful companies such as Google, Amazon, Trader Joe’s and Costco, which maintain scandal-free business practices and a solid customer base.
It is possible, at least according to Mackey, to be both capitalistic and virtuous. “Free-enterprise capitalism is the most powerful system for social cooperation and human progress ever conceived,” he writes.
Studies reveal that Mackey has a valid point. Companies with histories of corruption, environmental degradation or dishonesty are historically more likely to face enormous financial repercussions, which hinder or even destroy business. “The most amazing business models are those where profit and social impact live in harmony. Business models can be designed where impact doesn’t diminish revenues or profit and vice versa,” financial analyst Alex Osterwalder wrote in the Harvard Business Review.
If adopted successfully, that kind of mentality could entail a shift in public opinion about corporations. Recent movements such as Occupy Wall Street indicate that the American public is fed up with an industry that appears to exploit people for profit. In 2008, First Lady Michelle Obama famously said at a conference for women, “Don’t go into corporate America. Become teachers. Work for the community …  Make that choice, as we did, to move out of the money-making industry into the helping industry.” The diminished trust in business leaders has encouraged politicians and policy makers to consider tax increases and corporate limitations. The more corporate scandals surface, the less likely it that corporations will ever regain legitimacy in the eyes of the American people.
Conscious capitalism could change that trend. It’s time we stop treating profits and purpose as two separate entities in the business setting, and USC graduates can and should start initiating that change. Business is a vehicle for social change and progress and if more businesses maintain a commitment to a positive shared value for society, all parties involved will benefit. In the words of Mackey, “Capitalism is one of the most compelling ideas we humans have ever had. But we can aspire to something even greater.”
It’s time for businesses to adjust their aspirations, retire questions like “Are you making money?” and start asking questions like, “Are you creating value?” If they are able to do this, there might be a day in the near future when a corporate career is perceived to be as beneficial for society as any other career, briefcase and all.
