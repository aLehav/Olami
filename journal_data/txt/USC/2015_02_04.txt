The Hazard Recreation Center, nestled in East Los Angeles, received a donation for $1 million from the University of Southern California to implement recreational and architectural improvements around the area.
The park is adjacent to USC’s Health Sciences Campus and serves as a local hangout spot. The recreation center includes new facility features, such as basketball courts, a children’s play area and an indoor gym.
Last week, Martha Escutia, the vice president for USC Government Relations offered the check on behalf of C.L. Max Nikias and USC. The donation ceremony proposed to the Los Angeles Parks Foundation had an attendance of more than 200 district locals.
José Huizar, Los Angeles City Councilmember of the 14th District, was among the ceremony’s large group of spectators.
Huizar aided Escutia in granting the $1 million donation. Before the donation was given, the Hazard community reached out to Huizar and USC to help provide upgrades to the park. USC’s original plan to build a connecting street from Soto Street to the HSC was withdrawn.
“I’m so proud to work with the city and the USC Government Relations and Civic Engagement teams who welcomed community dialogue,” Huizar said in a statement released by USC News. “I’m also proud to serve communities who welcomed the help to improve the lives of all who work, live, study or receive medical help around the neighborhood.”
The USC contribution will fund improvements for the park and recreation center, including additional parking spaces, tennis courts and exercise equipment. Groups helping aid renovations to the recreation center include the Hazard Preservation Committee and the City Department of Parks and Recreation.

On Wednesday afternoon, the Jesse M. Unruh Institute of Politics, held its weekly Students Talk Back discussion, which focused largely on President Barack Obama’s final two years in office.
The event was moderated by Dan Schnur, executive director of the Unruh Institute of Politics and Annie Wanless, a student staff member at the Unruh Institute. It featured guest panelists Jim Bognet, former media consultant to former Gov. Mitt Romney’s presidential campaign, and Robert Shrum, political consultant and Carmen H. and Louis Warschaw Chair in Practical Politics at the USC Dornsife College.
Bognet is noted for his work as a Republican-campaign strategist who served as a media consultant to Romney during the 2012 election. Shrum is a Democratic political consultant with experience in leading presidential, senatorial and gubernatorial campaigns.
Wanless began the conversation by asking both panelists to identify which issues they perceive to be most significant between Obama and the newly elected Republican Congress.
In Obama’s annual State of the Union address, the president affirmed his plan to be more assertive on a number of policy issues that ranged from tax reform to immigration. During the speech, Obama reiterated his power to utilize executive action and veto bills to continue his policy plans. His certainty to maintain power over the Congress already foreshadows potential conflicts ahead between the legislative and executive branches.
Shrum described Obama’s budget as non-progressive, as it would include a tax rate for capital gains for the highest-earning Americans. The increase would move the current 20 percent rate to 28 percent for individuals in that tax bracket.
“The president’s budget is a non-starter,” Shrum said. “The Republicans are not going to approve any of these tax changes, even some that I think might be very popular with the country.”
Shrum also identified immigration reform as an area in which the biggest clashes will take place in Congress.
Bognet agreed with Shrum and acknowledged that the most contentious issue between the two parties in Congress will be immigration. He also mentioned that the president’s budget plan is a strategic “table-setter” for the 2016 presidential election.
“There will be no new taxes passed, the country cannot clamor for new taxes, so Obama will not be able to go out and put pressure on Congress, [Obama and Congress] have budget fights, there will probably be some vetoes, but I think that will probably be worked out much more easily than immigration,” Bognet said.
Furthermore, Bognet explained that Obama has made a political choice to spend the remainder of his time in office building his legacy through utilizing executive action.
“He is not going to get his legacy from big deals with Congress, he’s going to get his legacy from executive actions in the foreign policy arena,” Bognet said, citing the president’s plan to normalize relations with Cuba as a primary example.
Building off of Bognet’s response, Wanless asked both panelists how Obama’s actions might affect the 2016 election.
Shrum agreed with Bognet’s remark about Obama’s budget plan being somewhat of a “table setter” for 2016.
He also added that he believes Hilary Clinton has a good chance of being elected president because of her focus on providing aid to the middle class.
“If 2016 goes the wrong way; a lot of what [Obama] has done is going to get undone. I think he cares very deeply about 2016,” Shrum said. “I said he was going to rely on executive orders, he is going to rely on them, because he can do some big things with them number one and number two he is really going to try in foreign policy to achieve two or three big things. One is an agreement with Iran; two is to complete this Cuban process.”
Bognet predicted that the president would utilize executive orders and power of the veto to place pressure on Republicans and hurt the chances of the Republican nominee in the 2016 election.
“President Obama would love to see a Democrat elected in 2016, he would love to take credit for that, and I think you have to look at many of the actions he takes through that prism,” Bognet said.
Schnur and Wanless opened up questions for the panelists to students in the audience.
The first question addressed the topic of energy and asked whether or not Shrum and Bognet felt that there was an obligation to help inhabitants of states such as West Virginia and Kentucky, which strongly depend on coal as an energy source.
Both panelists believe that a conscious effort is necessary to bring in new industries and jobs to sustain the economy. They also explained that a plan to safeguard West Virgina and Kentucky’s state economy once coal is no longer their primary source of energy is unforeseeable.
Correction: This article has been updated to note that Jim Bognet was on a team of media consultants for Mitt Romney, not the only one, as the article previously implied. The Daily Trojan regrets this error.

Despite online promotion, only one student attended the USG Candidate Meet and Greet in the Ronald Tutor Campus Center on Wednesday evening.
At the event, USG candidates gathered for an informal networking event.  Students had the opportunity to individually meet the presidential, vice presidential and senatorial candidates to ask them specific questions about their platforms.
USG had booked the room from 7 p.m. to 8 p.m. The Director of Elections and Recruitment Kandace London, however, determined there wasn’t enough interest in the event and officially dismissed the meet and greet at 7:30 p.m.
“We didn’t want to waste any of the candidates time,” said Christine Hennes, USG senior director of communications.
Candidates had the option of remaining in the room until 8 p.m. when the room reservation expired.
One student arrived at the event after 7:30 p.m., though by that point, only presidential ticket Providence Ilisevich and Ehren Elder were present.
“In all honesty, it was mostly just candidates at the event,” Rini Sampath, USG presidential candidate and current USG vice president, said. “But, I guess one thing that definitely showed was that we need to reach out to more students to come to these events. Elections and recruitments have done a phenomenal job, but, definitely getting students to become more interested in student government [is important].”
Instead, Sampath and Jordan Fowler, USG vice presidential candidate, said that the candidates utilized the time to meet the other tickets running.
“The meet and greet was really fun because we got to sit down and meet the other people running,” Fowler said. “Not just the presidential tickets, which are the people I’m more familiar with, but those who were running for Senate.”
Eric Suen, a junior majoring in economics who was the one student to attend the event, explained that he heard about the meet and greet because he is a member of a USG committee.
He commented that the low student attendance correlates to the lack of university-wide promotion for the USG election.
“Right now, the student body isn’t as serious as [USG would] like [it] to be.”
Elder attributed the low student attendance at USG election events to the fact that three events were scheduled for consecutive days.
“We had an incredible turnout last night with the diversity debate and I’m expecting to see another incredible turnout tomorrow [for the presidential debate],” Elder said. “ It’s tough to ask so many students to come out three nights in a row.”
Illisevich seemed to be sure that students would participate in the election.
“Students are still engaged in these elections and the elections and recruitment teams put a lot of effort into everything they do,” Ilisevich said. “I know they’ll do a great job with the booths on campus. They’ve also made it really easy because you can vote online now and I think a lot of students will use the opportunity.”
Suen said the candidate meet and greet event ultimately helped him decide which candidate he wanted to vote for.
“I’m very glad I talked to them, because they are also students that want to have changes,” Suen said. “Every year the presidents change and I want to know if they’re actually going to bring changes. I just really wanted to get some personal one on one time. The way [the candidates] carry themselves gives me a good impression of them.”

The USC women’s water polo team finally played its first home game of 2015. For the first time this season, the Women of Troy opened up their home slate of games at the Uytengsu Aquatics Center with a scrimmage against the U.S. Women’s National Team.
The No. 3-ranked Women of Troy (2-0) matched up against some of the best players in the world in what would be a tune-up for a tough upcoming road schedule.
After two blowout wins to open up the season at the UCLA Invite, starting with a 33-5 thrashing of Cal State Bakersfield and then a 24-3 beatdown of Cal Baptist, the water polo team hoped to use this scrimmage as an opportunity to get some of the younger and less experienced players to be more comfortable in a highly competitive atmosphere. With a challenging MPSF conference schedule looming, the Women of Troy needed all the practice and experience they could get.
Youth has been the story for this new Women of Troy squad, as there are 13 freshmen listed on the roster and two more transfers. Although led by senior captains and All-Americans Monica Vavic and Eike Daube, there have been at least eight newcomers who have already contributed early on in the season. Freshman goalie Victória Chamorro won the starting spot in the cage and has proven to be a force when it comes to blocking shots, totaling nine saves in just two games. Sydney Blubaugh and Brianna Daboub, local products from Mater Dei High School, are two other freshmen who have seen significant playing time as a two-meter and driver. Ultimately, the Women of Troy hoped to gain more experience and confidence from their scrimmage against team USA.    The team also though that it would be a great way to gauge how they would fare against much tougher competition.
The friendly against the national team would be the lone home game in a span of seven weeks on the schedule for the Women of Troy, who must now gear up for three consecutive weekend road trips to continue NCAA action.
After starting the season off in Westwood at the UCLA Invite, the Women of Troy will first head down to San Diego for the UCSD Triton Invitational on Saturday, Feb. 7, facing the Pioneers of Cal State East Bay at 8:30 a.m. A week later on Saturday, Feb. 13, the team will then make the trek down to Riverside for the Lancer Invitational, where they face Cal Baptist at 4 p.m. and Redlands at 5:15 p.m. USC will then play two matches on Valentine’s Day — the first against Pomona-Pitzer at 11:30 a.m. and the second against Occidental College at 2 p.m.
Finally, the last of the string of away games will be at the UCI Invitational in Irvine on Saturday, Feb. 21. The Women of Troy won’t be back home for another month when MPSF foe and current No. 1-ranked Stanford comes to Troy in a nationally televised game at 6 p.m.

National Signing Day featured an old-fashioned horse race, and Traveler, the noble white horse representing the prosperity of the USC football program, made a miraculous run down the stretch to come out on top on the annual recruiting race on Wednesday.
I’m still feeling goosebumps from signing day as if an announcer at the race track was chronicling the day’s events in just a matter of seconds because that’s how fast it felt everything took place.
There wasn’t actually a horse race taking place on Wednesday, but head coach Steve Sarkisian sure did finish the recruiting cycle as if he were California Chrome in last year’s Kentucky Derby.
In business and sales especially, there’s a certain frequently phrase thrown around: “Always  be closing,”which was famously coined by Alec Baldwin in the 1992 film Glengarry Glen Ross.
Sarkisian and his staff did exactly that by hitting a home run on the recruiting trail for the second consecutive year and capping it off with a grand slam on signing day. Heck, I just wish the team could close games as well as it does on recruits.
Last year, USC had the “Big Three” — JuJu Smith, Damien Mama and Adoree’ Jackson — this year, we have what is being called the “Fab Five.”
The Trojans took care of business  by nabbing all five of these highly touted recruits, which started with the signing of the Utah five-star linebacker tandem of Porter Gustin and Osa Masina, who made their decisions prior to Wednesday. The Trojans would then go on to ink five-star defensive tackle and another five-star linebacker in John Houston, Jr., to continue the continuous pipeline from Junipero High School in Gardena, California.
Finally, a successful day would be capped off with the commitment of the nation’s top cornerback in five-star Iman “Biggie” Marshall from Long Beach Poly High School , who announced his decision to everyone in quite the creative manner, pulling up to the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum and throwing on his USC hat in an exclusive Bleacher Report video.
It was like something out of a Disney movie, really, and I couldn’t have imagined a better way to propel the Trojans to the pinnacle in their first full class since the end of the NCAA sanctions.
It just took a timespan of a few hours to jolt the Trojans’ 2015 recruiting class past Nick Saban and Alabama to the No. 1 spot in the nation, according to Rivals.com.
USC started the day with the No. 2 class based on Rival’s rankings, but with a perfect run for the so-called big fish on Signing Day, they were able to eclipse the Crimson Tide for the top spot in the land.
Sarkisian sent a message last year on signing day with the high caliber of a class he was able to pull in even with only 19 scholarships as opposed to 25, but on Wednesday, he made a statement not only to the rest of the Pac-12, but all of division one football that when at full strength, USC is quite the force to be reckoned with.
Is this a representation of the balance of power shifting back west from the SEC to the Pac-12?
It very well could be, but we still have a lot of player development to be had and football to be played before we can say that.
Let’s remember again that highly ranked recruiting classes don’t always translate into national championships, but it sure is a good start.
Sarkisian has always been seen as an effective recruiter, especially when it comes to recruiting players out of the program’s very own backyard of Southern California.
This was once again prevalent in 2015, as the Trojans were able to retain all four signing day commitments in the state of California.
Of course, Sarkisian’s familiarity with the area and the program are a huge asset, though the “Sark Knight” has a secret weapon: recruiting ace and wide receivers coach Tee Martin.
In the past, Martin has recruited the likes of Jackson, Nelson Agholor and Marqise Lee  and locked up Marshall in this class.
Earlier this week, Martin was named the No. 7 best recruiter in all of the land by the Sporting News.
When it comes to rating this recruiting class from top to bottom, I would personally have to give them an A. They not only addressed their needs on both sides of the ball including nine top-rated players that cover all facets of the defense, but added a great deal of talent for the future.
This includes their potential quarterbacks of the future in early enrollee Ricky Town out of St. Bonaventure and Sam Darnold from San Clemente High School down in southern Orange County.
The only reason I gave Sarkisian and his staff an A and not an A+ is that the program lost the fan hood of long-time dedicated Trojans enthusiast Snoop Dogg, who claimed he would throw away all of his USC drawers after his son, four-star wide receiver Cordell Broadus announced that he would be playing his college ball across town at UCLA.
The most important thing that the 2015 class give to USC, though, is depth. Many of us still remember the numerous late-game collapses that were later blamed on a lack of depth, but now finally, with a full recruiting class under their belt, this should no longer be an issue.
The program is once again at the top of the rankings off the field, but if anything, this calls for even greater expectations for Sarkisian and his team on the field.
No more sanctions and no more depth issues means no more excuses.
Once again, USC is equipped with the assets to be great and as this recruiting class has shown, it’s capable of not only winning local in-conference battles but national championships.

The USC Trojans    (9-12, 1-8 Pac-12) look to end their six-game losing streak as they head on the road to face the California Golden Bears (13-9, 3-6). The Trojans beat Cal earlier in the season,    72-57 at the Galen Center, but USC has lost 8 of their last 9 games.
USC is coming off a blowout loss to the Utah Runnin’ Utes    (17-4, 7-2) last Sunday at home, 67-39. The Trojans were led in that game by freshman forward Malik Martin who scored 11 points for USC.
In the worst loss of the season, the Trojans continued their poor shooting with only 26.5 percent; the loss was the largest margin of defeat that the Trojans have seen so far this season. The Trojans only scored 12 points in the first half and could never get back into the game.
USC head coach Andy Enfield gave credit to Utah for their stellar performance in the first half.
“Give Utah credit for playing well early,” Enfield said. “This was one of those halves of basketball where you shake your head and say, ‘Wow, we didn’t see this coming.’”
In Cal’s most recent contest, they beat the Washington State Cougars (10-11, 4-5)                                   90-88. The Bears had two record performances in the game in Washington when they witnessed junior guard Tyrone Wallace enter the 1,000-point club and senior forward David Kravish break the school’s all-time block record. Cal will look at these two difference-makers to avoid a season sweep at the hands of USC.
Cal will also lean on sophomore guard Jordan Mathews who is leading the team in scoring with an average of 18.2 points per game, in Cal’s nine league games.
In the most recent game between these two California teams, the Trojans were led to victory by sophomore forward Nikola Jovanovic who scored 21 points and pulled down nine rebounds in USC’s only conference win of the season. Redshirt sophomore guard Katin Reinhardt added 16 points for the Trojans in one of his signature shooting performances while sophomore guard Julian Jacobs added 17 points in the win. Wallace led the way for the Bears in the loss with 21 points of his own.
Jovanovic leads the Trojans in scoring with 13.2 points per game, and Reinhardt is not too far behind with an average of 11.9 points per game.
Reinhardt has found his stroke as of late and is shooting 44.2 percent from behind the arc in his last six games.
USC will look for freshman point guard Jordan McLaughlin to break out of his recent slump and help contribute to a win up north.
In USC’s most recent loss to Utah, McLaughlin was scoreless on 0-7 shooting and he also had zero assists. Despite his struggles, McLaughlin is still third on the team in scoring with 11.6 points per game.
McLaughlin is having an impressive freshman season, outside of shooting, and he leads his team in assists and steals with 88 and 28 respectively.
The other freshmen for the Trojans have also struggled as of late, especially in scoring. Guard Elijah Stewart was scoreless against Utah and forward Malik Marquetti only scored 2 points in 21 minutes. Even though the bench has not been very productive scoring the ball, Enfield praised their effort after the loss to Utah.
“I’m proud of our bench coming in and increasing our energy,” Enfield said. “We need the whole team to play like that.”
When the Trojans tip off on Thursday night, they will be playing in a stadium that has not been kind to them recently. USC is 2-6 in its last 8 visits to Haas Pavilion where the Bears are 8-6 this season.
USC has not fared well on the road all season; they post a 2-6 road record on the year. Tipoff is at 8 p.m. and will be aired on Fox Sports 1.

Head Coach Steve Sarkisian and the USC football program picked up one of their most successful recuiting classes in recent history on National Signing Day.
USC’s 2015 class not only dethroned Alabama’s four-year run with the top recruiting class on Rivals.com, but it was also ranked No. 1 by Scout.com,  was slated No. 2 by both               247Sports.com and Prep Star as well as No. 3 by ESPN.com.  While this is huge for the Trojans, Sarkisian pointed out that it’s “only a piece of the puzzle” to the team’s success.
If USC will return to the national powerhouse that it was  a decade ago, this is a step in the right direction in its  first  year back with fully-instated scholarship numbers following the NCAA sanctions that derived from the Reggie Bush scandal.
Focusing on size, speed and physicality, the Trojans pulled in four five-star, 14 four-star and eight three-star recruits. Fulfilling the drive for five and picking up the “Fab Five” — linebacker and tight end Osa Masina, linebackers Porter Gustin and John Houston Jr., defensive lineman Rasheem Green and cornerback Iman Marshall.
Sarkisian shared that Gustin “is going to be a great leader;” that Marshall is “unique” with his physicality and mentality; and that both Masina and Gustin will see some time on offense.
One  of the most memorable events was Marshall’s announcement video on BleacherReport.com. About 20 minutes before his scheduled announcement, the video, titled “The Commitment,” revealed that Marshall would be attending USC. Sarkisian thought Marshall’s approach was “really cool and very well done.”
The rest of the 2015 class is filled out with one junior college transfer, wide receiver De’Quan Hampton and 13 freshmen: defensive lineman Jacob Daniel, quarterback Sam Darnold, running back and wide receiver Dominic Davis, defensive lineman Noah Jefferson, running back Ronald Jones II, defensive back and wide receiver Isaiah Langley, tight end Tyler Petite, defensive lineman Christian Rector, defensive back and wide receiver Ykili Ross, defensive lineman Kevin Scott, offensive lineman Cole Smith, defensive back Marvel Tell III and running back Aca’Cedric Ware.
Of the players who joined USC this January, there is one junior, wide receiver Isaac Whitney, and four freshmen, offensive lineman Chuma Edoga, offensive lineman Roy Hemsley, line backer Cameron Smith, and quarterback Ricky Town.
Sarkisian pointed out that he couldn’t be happier with this year’s class. The coaching staff took a different approach to the recruiting process as compared to last year, and it definitely paid off.
“This year around, we were a lot more calculated,” Sarkisian said. “It turned out exactly how we wanted it to.”
The best part about the class of 2015 is the depth they provide to the team. There are multiple guys who can work both sides of the ball and guys that add depth to previously limited positions (thanks to sanctions).
Sarkisian spoke about how the defensive players of this class will be key considering the amount of seniors that will be leaving on the defense at the end of next season. He’s looking at them to create a more “physical secondary.”
Sarkisian also emphasized that their “first goal” was getting recruits from California. Of the 24 recruits in the Class of 2015, 17 of them are from California. He shared that it’s more than just a numbers game; it’s about the “individuals.”
A huge emphasis on recruiting was placed on the defense. With Williams and Pullard leaving, USC needs players who can step up and fill in their positions, and there are guys in this class that can do just that.
In Sarkisian’s view, it is more than just getting the right guys to fill in positions: it’s about developing an unstoppable, dominant team.
“We need to build a football team that has the potential to be a bully,” Sarkisian explained. “To be a really good defense, you need to be a bully.”
On the two quarterbacks, Ricky Town and Sam Darnold, Sarkisian shared that he just loves them. Town, who is already enrolled at USC, “has been a rock” for USC and Darnold just “blew [the coaching staff] away.”
According to Sarkisian, one of the most compelling factors that entices recruits to USC is the “amazing brand” that is USC. Not only does the football program boast tradition and championships, the university provides countless academic opportunities.
“This place in unbelievable,” Sarkisian stated. “The power of the degree and life after football is just as important.”
Looking forward to the season, Sarkisian emphasized getting the recruits to work over summer to prep for their first game against Arkansas State.
“We want to be a really complete football team,” Sarkisian commented. “Ultimately, this class is going to win a lot of games.”
Based on the unbelievably successful day for the Trojans, there are plenty of expectations for the upcoming season. If everything pans out the way that it’s currently set out, then the Trojans should expect to feel like the same birthday-esque feelings from National Signing Day and find the long-awaited success that has been missing from the program since Pete Carroll’s era.
The Trojans return to football officially when Spring Practice kicks off on March 3.

When I first told my friend Jersey about the Peace Awareness Labyrinth and Gardens, his first reaction was one of incredulity: “A labyrinth? Like with minotaurs?”
Eye of the storm · The Peace Awareness Labyrinth and Gardens, located only three miles from the University Park campus, is run by the Church of the Movement of Spiritual Inner Awareness. The church preaches the need of everyone to find their own way in the world. – Photo courtesy of the Movement of Spiritual Inner Awareness
Apparently, the original definition of the word “labyrinth” was the home of the ancient Greek creature.
Not surprisingly, the Peace Awareness Labyrinth does not house a minotaur, though it is home to something equally exotic: nature in the middle of Los Angeles.
The Peace Awareness Labyrinth is located on Adams Boulevard, a mere three miles from campus. Surrounded by slightly shabby houses in a primarily residential neighborhood, the PAL&G’s extravagant, gated property stands out.
The blatantly beautiful mansion serves as the focal point of the property. Upon our arrival, we were greeted by Bill, our “docent” and tour guide. We learned that the house, built in the early 1900s, has a longer history than the accompanying gardens, which weren’t added until the 1990s.
Though we were anxious to go outside, we politely accepted Bill’s offer of a house tour. Bill proudly boasted about the home’s oak floors and marble trimmings, but for those uninterested in interior decor (me), the “solarium” is undoubtedly the mansion’s coolest feature.
We rushed ahead of Bill into the second-floor solarium, which features ridiculously comfortable chairs and a nearly panoramic view of the garden below. Our chaperone gently explained that if someone had been meditating in the room, it would have been inappropriate for us to enter.
Originally built for Secundo Guasti, who owned the world’s largest winery at the time, the Italian Renaissance-style mansion was acquired in 1974 by the Church of the Movement of Spiritual Inner Awareness, fondly referred to as “the movement” by its members.
This “movement” itself is a purposefully vague take on religion — it mainly focuses on “soul transcendence” and is open to people of all religious backgrounds. The movement places a significant emphasis on self-reflection and knowing one’s self, through activities like meditation and walking the labyrinth.
“There’s no judgment here, the movement allows individuals to find their own way and be who they want to be,” said Bill.
John-Roger, who is memorialized in photos throughout PAL&G, founded the movement in 1968.  It’s grown modestly since, and now claims 5,000 active members worldwide.
According to the movement’s website, PAL&G is meant to be “a place of peace for all.”
And if there’s anything stressed college students need, it’s peace. I’ve never meditated before, and even after the house tour, I still had no clue what a non-minotaur-housing labyrinth looked like, but if there’s one thing I wanted from my PAL&G experience, it was peace.
After much anticipation and a lengthy tour, we were finally allowed to enter the labyrinth and garden, located in the multi-layered backyard behind the mansion.
The garden is a hidden sanctuary in our urban area. I wandered around in disbelief, wondering how a bamboo-filled jungle appeared in Los Angeles. Fountains, a koi pond and exotic plants contributed to the garden’s soothing mood. Throughout the garden, people sat peacefully in meditation. Those who weren’t meditating admired the foliage quietly.
Yolanda, Bill’s wife and fellow member of the movement, briefed us on how to properly walk the labyrinth. The labyrinth is circular, with a white path weaving through it. There isn’t one certain way to walk the labyrinth, and like much of the movement’s beliefs, it’s the individual’s choice. Some people focus on a singular question while walking; others empty their minds in a state of moving meditation.
The labyrinth was modeled after the one at Chartres Cathedral in France, built around 1220. It’s about one-third of a mile long, which feels a lot longer during a slow-paced walk of self-reflection.
I wasn’t fully satisfied with my labyrinth experience. Granted, I entered with the big question of what I should do with my life, but I thought I’d have expected a major epiphany during my one-third mile walk.
My friend Alyssa suggested that I was asking too much of it, and that it’s better to simply enter with an open mind and see where your thoughts take you.
“You might feel lost, as if you’re in a maze, but have faith that you are on your path,” she said wisely.
Somehow, the labyrinth transformed my previously skeptical friends into insightful philosophers.
“Perhaps the labyrinth represents the passions and losses we will experience in life, yet ultimately signifies the tranquility we will find if we follow the path of our hearts,” said my friend Jon.
The labyrinth didn’t transform my mind, increase my self-awareness or anything else listed in the PAL&G’s brochures. I forgive the PAL&G and will probably return, just to escape city life for a day in the jungle.

I love this place … most peaceful place in Los Angeles … and it’s free.

Just what would you do for some extra cash? MTV’s newest TV show Broke A$$ Game Show, hosted by USC alumnus David Magidoff, wants to find out.
What would you do? · In Broke A$$ Game Show, David Magidoff (right) partners with Derek Gaines to see just what the people of New York will do for some quick cash. Some of the challenges have included impromptu twerk-offs and eating cotton candy off the body of a friend. – Photo courtesy of MTV
Magidoff graduated from USC with degrees in creative writing and theatre. During his time at USC, he frequented comedic improv shows. Then, post-graduation, this funnyman pursued acting. Eventually, he landed his gig as a host of MTV’s own unique and ridiculous game show.
Broke A$$ Game Show follows hosts Magidoff and Derek Gaines as they traverse the streets of New York City in order to discover just what people will do for cold hard cash. This promising 30-minute show reinvents the game show genre so that the games are crazier, funnier and set in real life.
The shenangians are bolstered and framed by an improvisational display put on by the two hosts. “I improv so much of the show, along with Derek,” Magidoff said. “The show itself is probably 70 percent games, and 30 percent they just follow us, where we just do our own thing, and they just film it. I think the goal of the show is that you when you watch it, you want to hang out with Derek and I. Rather than, ‘Oh, it’s a game show that happens to be funny,’ but it’s more a comedy show that happens to have games.”
The show itself consists of Magidoff and Gaines hitting the streets of New York City to lure unsuspecting pedestrian into taking part in some outlandish games that push their personal boundaries in return for a cash reward. Instead of setting up shop in a traditional soundstage, the show is set exclusively in the street featuring fresh games like a “Twerk Off.”
Games like “Twerk Off” or “Cats Humping Streets ” are just as absurd as they sound. For example, “Twerk Off” showcases construction workers twerking to win the prize of a couple hundred dollars. “Cats Humping States” allows players the chance to win money by correctly identifying states where felines are known to mate. Overall, the show is a unique twist on typical daytime television.
In all, viewers should not expect a Jeopardy-esque TV show. Rather, this show is a combination of reality and MTV’s typical outlandish humor. Imagine shows such as Fear Factor or The Amazing Race, that incorporate MTV’s typical boundary-pushing humor, like Jackass.
Because Magidoff and Gaines are both hilarious comedians, viewers will enjoy watching their escapades in the concrete jungle. By just observing the distinct characters and people in New York City, viewers will truly enjoy Broke A$$ Game Show.
Magidoff said New York City was the perfect place to film this show.
“It really was just a big improv scene, where the setting was always New York City … to experience what it was like to just be a part of [it], like talking to a man who had 10 pigeons on him, named Snoop Birdy Bird, to playing a game where 10 people had to eat cotton candy off their friend’s body, and to where people had to dress up as sperm and had to jump into a zorb-like ball, an egg, like they had to inseminate it,” Magidoff said.
Though the show is literally all fun and games, Magidoff’s hard work propelled him to this leading role as the host. Acting requires constant auditions, rejection and discipline. Magidoff, to this day, utilizes lessons from his time at USC when he was majoring in theatere.
“I learned a lot from my USC teachers. This guy named Joe Hacker, a theater teacher, he taught a great performance for camera class,” Magidoff said. “And I still use his audition techniques to this very day, and I know from my other USC alumni friends that they do as well.”
Magidoff understands the art of struggling within the industry.  Though the business is highly competitive, Magidoff maintains a personable charisma and confidence. He is not a stranger to failure, but he understands how to cope with rejection. He said he hopes to spread this lesson to aspiring professionals in the entertainment industry.
“Professor Joe Hacker always kept the mentality that you’re never rejected. There’s just something else out there,” Magidoff said. “It’s not that they’re choosing the other guys over you, if you’re all in the final room, you’re all great … that is probably one of the most important pieces of advice I have received.”
Magidoff spoke from experience. As the founder of Monkey Butler — an international comedy show — and as an actor in a variety of shows such as UCB, iOWest, NCIS:LA, CSI, Austin & Ally and Netflix’s Richie Rich, Magidoff speaks from experience.
“I’m a relational person. I think if you don’t like people, but you want to be creative in the industry – you have to learn to like people,” Magidoff said, “You have to learn some sort of way to respect and honor them, because there are a lot of bizarre and weird people in the business. Dare I say, does that mean to learn to like yourself first?”

More multimedia content is online, as well. If you haven’t already, be sure to check out our videos and podcasts, including the weekly “Soundboard” where we make your voices heard on the latest campus issues.
All of these new aspects of our online presence are part of our efforts to provide this campus with content that best suits you, the reader. As we always say, the Daily Trojan is dedicated to being your first resource for campus news. Now that we are focusing our sights on the digital world ahead, this mission is more important and feasible than ever.
The print edition will always be the backbone of the Daily Trojan, but the new website marks a new era for the DT. We are no longer just a newspaper, and though we might be evolving, our values remain the same. Publishing the best stories possible remains our top priority. We are excited to provide you with a more convenient avenue to accessing campus news, and we look forward to filling this website with the honest, original reporting that has filled the pages of the DT for more than a century.

In December 2014, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration released a statement that proposed a change in its blood donation policy. Since the start of the AIDS epidemic in 1977, the FDA has banned any and all men who have had sex with other men from donating blood, since the transfusion of their blood has a higher risk of transmitting HIV and hepatitis B to recipients. The recommendation proposed last year suggested relaxing the blood donor deferral ban for men who have had sex with other men from lifetime to one year since the last sexual contact. According to the statement, the reform will be issued in 2015 if scientific research and evidence support the safety of blood donations from these men.
Marissa Renteria | Daily Trojan
While the reform could potentially allow more gay and bisexual men to become blood donors, many have criticized the policy and pointed out that such a change would not eliminate discrimination. American Civil Liberties Union’s legislative representative Ian Thompson called into question the one-year deferral recommendation, explaining that most gay and bisexual men in relationships would not be celibate for a year to meet the requirement. Essentially, even if this proposal gets approved, a significant amount of gay and bisexual men will still not be able to donate blood.
The FDA’s blood donation policy not only singles out gay and bisexual men, but it also offers very limited clarification on the term “gay men.” Buzzfeed News pressed the FDA on this issue, as transgender people do not seem to fit into any of the defined categories. An FDA spokesperson stated that the official policy is “to designate by sex at birth.” This definition creates much confusion about the gender and sexual orientation restrictions for transgender people. Men who identify as females and have sex with men cannot donate blood because they were born males. However, women who identify as male and have sex with men are allowed to donate blood, since they were born females. The logic behind this is supposedly scientific, as the FDA recommends that “male to female transgender individuals should be regarded as males for the purposes of determining donor eligibility.” In a society where transgender people are already seen by many as outcasts and abnormal, this typology further ignores transgender people’s rights to choose their own identities. This policy automatically makes transgender males social pariahs, which is instituted by  society’s failure to understand the backgrounds and health conditions of these individuals.
Identifying transgender women as gay males and banning gay and bisexual men from blood donation demonstrates severe victim-blaming and a violation of the human rights of the LGBT community. According to the Human Rights Campaign, under the strict current policy, 10 percent of HIV-infected units have slipped through despite having been run through HIV tests. Even though there is no published data to suggest that the 10 percent of donors were gay men, the FDA bans all gay men from donating blood to prevent future HIV-related instances. The FDA appears to believe that since gay and bisexual men historically have a higher risk of HIV infection, they are the main cause for the spread of the disease. The fundamental problem here is that these people are not eligible to be blood donors for reasons unrelated to their individual health risks. They have their rights taken away from them because they fall under a certain category of gender and sexual orientation.
The FDA policy officially bans males and transgender females who have engaged in sexual activities with men, but allows heterosexual males and females to donate blood, regardless of potential high-risk behaviors. On the contrary, two gay or bisexual men who have monogamous and/or protected sex cannot donate blood, whereas male and female heterosexuals who have unprotected sex with multiple partners are eligible, which is contradictory to the aim to protect blood recipients. As doctors and medical experts have stressed, a gay or transgender person’s risk of contracting HIV depends on his or her genetics and behavior.
To truly gather a large amount of donated blood and ensure the integrity of the blood, a more drastic amendment of the policy needs to be made. Stereotypes and fears, without sufficient scientific data to support them should not determine a person’s eligibility to donate blood. Rather, a system that puts risk level based on sexual behavior, genetics and drug use into consideration should be implemented. As the FDA and other organizations work to collect more data from scientific research and blood surveillance, a new policy that is free of discrimination will hopefully emerge.
Bad idea, starting with a bad headline. All actions in life “discriminate.” Unfair discrimination against people is another matter. After the vague, badly-written headline, comes an unproven assertion:  “Stereotypes and fears, without sufficient scientific data to support them should not determine a person’s eligibility to donate blood.” This is true, but did the FDA act without sufficient scientific data? The article writer does not cite statistics or quote official FDA guidelines, so how does she know that their restrictions are unfair?

Mariya Dondonyan | Daily Trojan
Tom Brady was not a highly touted recruit coming out of high school. He was taken in the sixth round in the 2000 NFL Draft — 199th overall, to be exact. He has faced adversity and has excelled. With a chip on his shoulder, Brady has shredded nearly every defense in his path during his lengthy NFL tenure, becoming one of the best quarterbacks in the history of the game.
Brady overcame a lackluster 40-yard dash time, proving that what he had between the ears was far more valuable than any measurable, such as his bench press or his shuttle run time.
Brady’s rise to primetime has been well documented, and though he continues to be one of the league’s most polarizing players, his competitive edge is truly one-of-a-kind. He has the savvy to give defensive coordinators headaches, the pocket presence to know how to avoid costly turnovers, and perhaps most importantly, he knows how to make the players around him better.
But how many quarterbacks like Tom Brady will we see in the future?
Brady’s counterpart in Super Bowl XLIX, Russell Wilson, is a dynamic runner. In fact, Wilson rushed for 849 yards in the 2014 regular season. That is 26 more rushing yards than Brady has in his entire career. Brady is in his 15th season, while Wilson is in his third. It is a staggering statistic, but it shows how the game is changing, despite the fact that this is an extreme example since Wilson is an absurdly talented runner while Brady is incredibly reluctant to leave to pocket and take off running.
Brady is a menace. But will teams without mobile quarterbacks begin to feel as though dual-threat quarterbacks can thrive in the pros as they watch Wilson torch teams with both his arms and his legs? Running quarterbacks are difficult to defend, but true dual-threat guys can be virtually impossible to stop.
Carolina’s Cam Newton and San Francisco’s Colin Kaepernick are other true dual-threat quarterbacks who readily come to mind, but even Johnny Manziel’s unpredictable playing style caught the attention of pro scouts. The camera was glued to Manziel in the green room on draft day as he “slipped” down the draft board, but he was still a first-round pick (second QB taken, after Blake Bortles, who went to Jacksonville third overall).
There were countless questions about Manziel’s maturity both on-and-off of the playing field, yet he was a first-rounder. At some point leading up to draft day, some kind of serious value was attached to Manziel’s ability to create something out of nothing, a skill that does not always translate to the NFL as well as scouts project.
There is a clear emphasis on— maybe even an infatuation with — mobile quarterbacks in today’s NFL. High-risk, high-reward. Defensive backs are now delivering linebacker-like hits, so even when a quarterback reaches the second level, his health is still in serious question in the open field. Mobile quarterbacks are highlight-reel-producing monsters when they can stay healthy, but that is never a guarantee in such a violent game.
Indianapolis Colts quarterback Andrew Luck is not a runner per se, but he is one heck of an athlete. His 2012 NFL Scouting Combine performance ran circles around Brady’s, quite literally, showing that today’s pocket passers are bigger, stronger, and faster than ever. Luck is mobile, but he is smart too. Great runner. Even better passer.
Similarly, Seattle’s Russell Wilson is a safe open-field runner who opts to slide rather than take massive hits, so it is possible to have the best of both worlds. It should be noted that, like Andrew Luck, Wilson is a phenomenal passer with great touch on his throws, so he is obviously a bit of a statistical outlier because of how outstanding he is at both passing and running.
However, there is something to be said for the pure pocket passer. A handful of premier college programs have stuck with the pocket passer approach, including—but not limited to—USC, Baylor, and Michigan State. Those programs seem to be doing just fine. Pro teams with pocket passers like Peyton Manning and Tom Brady are thriving, too.
So what is all the hype about a QB who looks more like a running back in the open field?
Maybe we will see a pocket passer quarterback renaissance of sorts at some point in time, but it seems highly unlikely with the development of—and success of—today’s up-tempo offenses in both college football and the NFL.
Pocket passers are effective. And while some would argue they have limited upside, it should also be noted that they are less injury-prone. Trade-offs, huh? Yes, they are a very real part of football, especially when it comes to crafting a college program or an NFL franchise with the QB as the integral puzzle piece.
Pocket passers are a joy to watch. But there are fewer and fewer of them, so just in case they become extinct soon, let’s enjoy watching Brady while we can.

Five-star recruit Iman Marshall, who is considered to the nation’s number one-ranked cornerback, officially signed with the Trojans on Wednesday afternoon, capping off an extremely successful Signing Day for the Trojans. He announced his decision via a music video released by the Bleacher Report.
With the signing of Marshall and the earlier commitments of five-star defensive tackle Rasheem Green and four-star linebacker John Houston, Jr., USC’s 2015 class has leaped past Alabama to No. 1 on the most recent rankings by Rivals.com
The nation’s No. 4-ranked recruit nationally and top-ranked player in California, according to 247Sports, chose USC over LSU, Florida State, Michigan and Notre Dame.
The 6-foot-1, 190-pound Marshall played on both sides of the ball last season for the Jackrabbits and was also recruited by wide receivers coach Tee Martin.
Marshall’s commitment came about a couple of hours after USC landed Green and Houston, both out of USC feeder school Junipero Serra High School in Gardena, California.
By completing a perfect run for all of USC’s main targets down the stretch including five-star linebacker Osa Masina and four-star Porter Gustin, head coach Steve Sarkisian will be welcoming what is being considered as one of the best classes in Trojans history.
This is the program’s first recruiting class since NCAA sanctions officially ended this past year.
Sarkisian is expected to give a press conference to wrap up the Trojans’ Signing Day at 4:30 p.m. at the John McKay Center.

Perched outside Trojan Grounds, you’re studying and generally minding your own business, when it arrives — the wave of long brown hair of a girl walking out of Starbucks. Donning oversized sunglasses, a loose tank top, lululemon leggings and Ugg boots, she clutches her venti Caramel Macchiato with whipped cream as if it alone gives her life at this very moment. You grimace and roll your eyes. How basic.
Yeah, that person was probably me — yesterday, or the day before, or whenever I went to Starbucks last. Sometimes, I’m so basic I can’t help but reclaim the identity as my own. But what exactly makes me basic? Perhaps our description of “basic” itself reveals more about us than about the subject of our characterization.
Urban Dictionary — the chief encyclopedia on all things pop culture — defines “basic” as among many things, uninteresting, vapid and boring. Perhaps the triteness of the action, then, plays a large part into our exasperation towards all things basic. And as our society moves closer and closer to the total reverence of hipsterdom, we more heavily reject those that like what is popular. It’s an argument that assumes that popularity implies insincerity, and while such a characterization is sometimes valid, the universal application of such a theory seems critical just for the sake of being critical.
We also tend to define basic-ness in terms of consumption — in the framework of Sperrys and pumpkin spice lattes. Perhaps the term “basic,” then, is a criticism of materialism itself. American economist and philosopher Thorstein Veblen might agree that our economic purchases define our social attitudes. In the idea of “conspicuous consumption,” he points out that consumption is so often a mechanism to publicly tout economic prowess. And certainly intuition tells us that social status and economic status are inherently intertwined. But perhaps our choice to draw the conclusion that certain purchases (e.g. lululemon leggings) are always indicative of certain personality traits (e.g. superficial and “basic” characteristics) indicates that we are the materialistic ones.
And yet, it’s hard to deny that the immense privilege that being “basic” entails is irritating. A basic girl attends yoga religiously yet has no idea of its religious impact, eats sushi weekly but can’t be bothered to learn how to use chopsticks and waits for hours in line for the newest iPhone whose features she doesn’t even know about. But such attitudes of entitlement span far greater than just the Instagram-happy, coffee-loving college girl; there’s no need to single girls out for their personal life choices.
I also can’t help but look at the feminist critique of being basic. It is yet another double standard that women are subject to — a woman shouldn’t be fat but should have curves, she shouldn’t wear revealing clothes but shouldn’t dress too conservatively, and she shouldn’t act too out-of-the-ordinary but god forbid she be basic. Where is the male counterpart to the “basic” — where is the term to degrade the unimaginative frat bro wearing a polo and cargo shorts?
“Basic” has become just another excuse to roll our eyes at those with different lifestyles than ours. So, the next time I say “basic,” I’ll be referring to a chemical substance with a pH above 7 (and happily sipping on a pumpkin spice latte while doing so).

I never thought I would say this, but at the end of first semester, hopping on a plane to the freezing-cold East Coast seemed quite appealing. Despite the football games, late nights and new friends that made up my first semester freshman year experience, part of me longed for the familiarity of my former home. And so, as I rolled up to airport at 5 a.m. — the earliest I had woken up in six months — I felt oddly happy.
Somehow, I was still smiling as the chilly wind slapped me across the face upon arriving in Maryland. The I’m-so-happy-to-see-you honeymoon period lasted quite a while, and I was pleasantly surprised to find that most people hadn’t changed very much. But as my friends and I shared our first semester memories, I began to realize the divergences in experience and subtle personality shifts.
Just one year ago, we were finishing up college applications, proofreading the beloved/detested Common Application and rolling our eyes at the monotony of high school. Now, we are spread out across multiple states, opposite coasts and varying cities, towns, rural areas and time zones. Are we really the same people if we lead such different lives?
Despite the many perks of attending USC and living in Los Angeles, I sometimes find myself jealous of my friends who are elsewhere. Dining hall lobster nights and ten-person classes, which I have now experienced over Snapchat, are undeniably enviable. Of course, this notion goes both ways. People tell me all the time how great it must be to live in California. It really is, especially on those 70-degree January mornings.
Sometimes, however, I wonder what it would be like to attend a small liberal arts school in a rural town, or a large public university, neither of which I considered applying to while I was looking at schools. In my mind, I had a very specific idea of what I wanted my college experience to encompass: great school spirit, a variety of academic programs and plenty of things to do off campus. USC was, and is, a great match. I now realize and acknowledge that each of us will have our own separate college experiences, largely shaped by our respective schools and areas around us. We are connected by the familiarity of our hometown, including many endearing memories and some things we would probably like to forget.
I always dread the lull in the conversation when you realize that there isn’t much left to talk about. It’s at that point you realize how many memories you have created while away at school, and how many things you have yet to do before you all meet again. Most of my interactions ended with promises to visit or FaceTime, both of which are fabulous and things I enjoy. Yet, I’m also realistic. I geographically removed myself from my old friends, and with that comes consequences: I won’t see them nearly as much as they will see each other.
But that’s okay. I have to grow a little on my own now.

Welcome back to the realities of college life. Syllabus week is over and the not-so-missed weekly readings are upon the student body once again. The daily routine of coffee runs and running on little to no sleep is back in action.
Though some of us students were hoping for just one extra week of rest, others couldn’t wait to hop on their plane back to LAX and be reunited with their new home at USC. Either way, students across campus are experiencing the stresses of classes once again. The struggle is real. Or is it? Here are some quick fixes to common struggles of USC students.
“I slept through all my alarms this morning.”
Make sure you are getting the right kind of sleep during the night. There are some simple steps students can take to ensure that the little sleep they do get, are good ones. Avoid drinking caffeinated drinks too closely to bed, eat right by avoiding heavy meals late at night, drink your alcohol earlier to increase deep sleep, and stretch out before hopping in bed.
“The line at TroGro is to the door and I need my coffee stat.”
When you are in a rush in the morning, but still need that cup of joe, know that your order can be made right at your fingertips. USC offers a smartphone application called Tapingo. This app allows you to select the exact order you would like to place in just seconds, so that when you arrive at the shop you don’t have to wait in the long line.
“I want to go to Cabo for Spring Break, but my parents say it is too dangerous and refuse to let me go.”
Know that there are a lot of people in the same boat as you. Look at different options that could be equally as fun. If you are just looking to get a tan, try Hawaii or Palm Springs. If you are just looking to party, but are under 21, there is always Canada or the Caribbean.

Sitting in your dorm room one late night, you realize that you are suddenly craving a sweet midnight snack. But the problem is, the dining halls are now closed, you’re low on cash and the food in your mini fridge is all too unappealing. So what are you to do?
Well if you have a mug, a microwave and a few simple ingredients, you my friend can very well have an exquisite, yet easy dessert in under five minutes.
I introduce to you the concept of microwavable meals in a new light: an indulgent chocolate lava cake.
For this masterpiece, you will need the following ingredients all which can be found at Fresh & Easy (aside from cocoa powder — check CVS instead):
1⁄4 cup flour
2 tbsp. unsweetened cocoa powder
2-3 tbsp. granulated sugar (depending on how sweet you like your desserts)
1⁄4 tsp. baking powder
2 tbsp. vegetable oil
1⁄4 cup + 1 tbsp. milk (I’d recommend a whole extra glass to go with the cake)
a tiny pinch of salt
a big spoonful of Nutella or your favorite chocolate or nut spread
 
First, mix all of the dry ingredients together and then add the vegetable oil and milk.

Pick out your favorite microwave-safe mug, preferably one about 14 ounces or bigger as you do not want a cake spill in your microwave, and pour your combined batter into the mug.

Before popping the mug into your microwave, drop a dollop, as big or as small as you would like, of Nutella or some other heavenly spread onto the top middle of your batter. A spread can be subbed with something else delicious like chocolate chips if you have any handy.

Place your chocolatey creation into the microwave. You may want to place a paper towel or plate underneath your mug in case the cake rises too much.
 
“Bake” for about 70 seconds on high. *Note* Microwaving times may vary depending on the power and wattage of each microwave, but 70 seconds on my roommate’s Oster 1000 watt microwave does the trick.

Before you dig into this lush and gooey chocolate dessert, give it a minute or two to cool down. And in the meantime, it is not required, but I would highly recommend that you either A) top off your cake with a scoop of vanilla ice cream or B) with a dollop of whipped cream and/or C) pair it with a glass of cold milk. Do all, do none — it’s up to you.

 
But most importantly, enjoy your rich and budget friendly five minute microwavable dessert!
**Results may vary. The Daily Trojan will not be held accountable for any microwave disasters, chocolatey messes and/or mug cake addictions that may result from this recipe.

My favorite time to be at USC — and in Los Angeles — is the spring. With the whole of spring semester 2015 upon us, it’s interesting to see how our fellow Trojans experience the season commonly associated with rebirth, flowers, baby animals and cleaning. At USC, it’s more common to associate spring with crop-tops, flower crowns, shorter haircuts and salmon colored shorts. But in its constant state of sunshiny wonder, L.A. is not a place for drastic seasonal change.
We wear crop-tops seasonally here. Spring arrives quietly and unassuming as we all run to class and go about out busy lives, but if you pay attention just to the trees on Trousdale you’ll see how they’ll start budding and making new leaves. Spring semesters are like those flowering trees most of us walk past every day. Preparing to burst open and start smelling good as our campus squirrels lose their winter fluff and start jumping after each other.
We come back with fall semester’s failures and triumphs behind us. Winter break has become a distant memory narrated by Bing Crosby, shrouded in the scents of cinnamon and pine. We’re ready to start a new year afresh and make the most out of what is remaining of the current academic year. Spring is a good time to make cleaner healthier choices about whatever has been bothering you be it psychological, your love life, academics, or your overall health. Maybe it’s time you confronted your roommate about their science experiment in the back of the fridge.
What’s most important to remember about the strange limbo-space that could be used to describe the wintery beginnings of spring semester is that not everyone is on the same path. Some of us are returning with years ahead of us, others are graduating come summer. Some are abroad having adventures in foreign lands, while others have just joined the Trojan Family as spring admits. Each of us will be experiencing our own struggles. Support in all forms can make a huge difference in the outcome of this semester.
Everyone I’ve talked to sees this semester more as an opportunity for change than a continuation of what they’ve been doing. Whatever stage any of us is at, it’s comforting to know that the silent forces that push spring forward are able to push us all forward, too.

About two hours south of Florence by car is the picturesque hilltop city of Assisi in the region of Umbria. Though well known for the Basilica of San Francesco d’Assisi with the works of famous Italian artist, Giotto, I was especially eager to visit Assisi because of what it’s famous for producing: truffles.
Not to get confused with the little chocolates in shinny glass cases in bakeries, this is a different kind of truffle — mushroom truffles. Grown underground, truffles are rare and can only be found using trained hogs to sniff them out. With certain truffles going for thousands of dollars a pound at auction, it is hard to resist the rich, unique flavor without spending a fortune; however, in the region of Umbria where truffles are more plentiful, each restaurant has a handful of truffle dishes that one can enjoy without breaking the bank.
Upon arrival, we hurried into the church to escape being swept away by the powerful gusts of wind and were instantaneously struck by the beauty of the artwork ornately painted on the wails and ceilings that surrounded us. Learning about the historical and biblical stories portrayed by Giotto and other 14th century Italian artists greatly enhanced the understanding of the symbolism and purpose of the upper and lower basilicas.
After spending a few hours marveling at the detailed frescos and gothic architecture of the basilica and strolling down the romantic and authentically-Italian streets of Assisi, we stumbled upon a typical Umbrian restaurant with an array of black and white truffle dishes. My friends and I decided that when in Umbria, do as the Umbrians do and proceeded to order different plates of pasta with black truffle. As for me, I got my favorite, gnocchi con tartufo nero. In most parts of the world, truffled pasta comes sautéed in truffle oil, but in Assisi, actual shavings of truffles are used in the preparation and presentation of the dish.

With each plate pretty much licked clean we ventured to the local gelateria and grabbed a quick dolci before heading back home to Florence. Overall, it was blustery yet flavorful day spent in Assisi.
XOXO,
Florentine Foodie

 
I read this: “truffles are rare and can only be found using trained hogs to sniff them out….” Change the h in hogs to d as in dogs and you would be correct. In Umbria we use dogs more than pigs. From a resident whose retriever has yet to learn what to sniff for.

After 30+ hours of sleepless travel, we finally arrived in the land of endless plates of pasta and pizza — Italy.
With orientation starting right as we stepped into the hotel, I felt like a kindergartener on the first day of school. The next day was the big day: meeting the Italian family I would be living with for the next three and a half months. Moving my finger down the posted list of host families, I was excited to discover that my roommate was a girl from Syracuse University whom I had met the day before. As my name was called, I anxiously rose up from my chair to meet an older Italian lady, my soon-to-be nonna Italiana, Anna Maria. Right away we exchanged the customary greeting of “Buonasera!” followed by a kiss on each cheek and I quickly realized that our host mom did not speak a word of English.
After we collected our luggage and took a ten-minute taxi ride, we were home. Anna Maria told us that she lived on the third floor, which is actually the fourth floor in Italy because the first floor is ‘0.’ After finding out that there was not an elevator in the building, reality hit — I was going to have to carry two 50-pound bags up four flights of stairs. As I dragged each of my bags up step-by-step, my roommate and I were in a constant state of hysterical laughter, which would be the first of our many bonding experiences.
Once we finished unpacking, my host mom called out “Pronto!” from the kitchen, which meant one thing: it was time for my first homemade Italian dinner. For our first plate, il primo, she cut out a piece of pesto lasagna with baked Parmesan cheese crumbles on top. The first language barrier misunderstanding occurred when I thought she asked if we wanted to move onto the second dish but, in actuality, she asked if we wanted more of the first.
In response, I turned to my roommate and whispered, “Looks like we’re going to be eating a lot here.” Though we were unimaginably stuffed after finishing our second helping of the lasagna, we were served the second plate, il secondo, a baked chicken with cheese and tomatoes.

Overall, it was an evening of good conversation, in spite of the language barrier, and delicious food — what more could a true Florentine want?
XOXO,
Florentine Foodie

Hello from across the pond! As of Monday, I have officially begun my semester study abroad in London. While everything right now is still very new, beautiful and British, I’m slowly adjusting to the cultural differences. Luckily, one of the first truly British cultural experiences I got to indulge in was one of the best — afternoon tea!
As a sort of welcome to London, the agency that organizes our program in conjunction with USC and City University, where I’ll be studying journalism, took the eleven of us out to tea at the British Museum. Though simply getting to enjoy a meal in one of the most famous London landmarks would be amazing on its own, the tea was also incredible.
In America, when we have tea in the afternoon — or more likely coffee — we have simply that. Maybe we’ll indulge and share a pastry from Starbucks with a friend, but it’s nothing like afternoon tea in Britain. Here, high tea is an event. In addition to your tea (which comes in your very own pot to pour into your proper cup and saucer), tea includes trays of finger sandwiches, scones with jam and clotted cream (which tastes much better than it sounds), and mini pastries on tiered trays. You’re pretty much in foodie heaven.
And, after a long day of walking around the city in the 30-degree weather, it’s the perfect way to just be able to relax and talk with friends. We Americans are just too frantic sometimes I think (though I must say, the average walking pace in London is more of a sprint), and don’t always take a chance to enjoy the moment.
Afternoon tea is definitely a ritual I can see myself adopting.

USC landed two more big commitments on 2015 National Signing Day when five-star defensive lineman Rasheem Green and four-star linebacker John Houston, Jr. signed with the Trojans on Wednesday. 
 
Green, the No.23 national recruit according to 247Sports, chose USC over Miami and Pac-12 rivals Arizona State and Oregon. 
 
The 6-foot-5, 275-pound defensive tackle  recorded 47 tackles and 20 sacks during his last two seasons at Junipero Serra High School in Gardena, California, a widely known feeder-school for USC talent. He was recruited by recruiting guru and wide receivers coach Tee Martin and defensive line coach Chris Wilson. 
 
Green’s teammate, the 6-foot-3, 211-pound Houston, chose the Trojans over Miami, Oklahoma, Oregon and Arizona State. He was slated as the sixth best linebacker in the country by 247Sports and finished his three-year career at Serra with 413 tackles. 
 
The 2015 Under Armour All-America participant was also recruited by Martin. 

With the commitments of both Green and Houston now finalized, the Trojans are now only waiting on the decision of the nation’s best cornerback, in five-star recruit Iman Marshall. 
 
Marshall, out of local powerhouse Long Beach Poly, is expected to make his decision at 1 p.m. PST. 
 
Should the Trojans land Marshall, USC’s 2015 class, which is currently ranked No. 2 behind Alabama by Rivals.com, could make a push for the land’s No.1-ranked recruiting class. 
 
In the program’s first recruiting class since NCAA sanctions officially ended, head coach Steve Sarkisian has already produced what is considered to be one of the best classes in Trojans history.

So I’m a fifth-year undergrad, and I did it solely in order to participate in USC’s yearlong study abroad program in Santiago, Chile. I had put these plans aside during my junior year because I thought James Franco was going to springboard my career into Hollywood or whatever, and then again in my senior year to do a thesis project I cared a lot about. But study abroad had to happen for me because, let’s be real, when in my life will I have funding to enroll in top-ranked South American universities ever again?
My parents migrated to another continent in their early 20’s too — except theirs involved hopping onto a fishing boat in the middle of the night and through several refugee camps until they ended up in Los Angeles, where they’ve remained for the last few decades.
I don’t see my traveling as anything remotely similar to what my parents went through during their migration. Theirs didn’t have the financial and institutional backing of a private university. They didn’t migrate with the explicit intention of bettering the lives of their unborn children (as is apparently the only acceptable story for “deserving” immigrants to the United States), since they were then still kids themselves. They did it to survive.
So yes, I have the privilege of traveling for more than survival and while study abroad programs can be a way to “see the world,” it cannot truly be seen without the context of Western colonization, imperialism, multi-national corporations, and transnational capitalist economic policies. We have to think critically about our place in that continuing legacy no matter where we go. So I’m constantly torn between possibly contributing to neo-colonialism by simply traveling as a Westerner and acknowledging that travel in this already globalized world is necessary in order for one to critically, intentionally and actively work to counteract these kinds of global oppression.
And besides, I really wanted to actually learn how to speak Spanish.

“If you had the chance to be white, would you take it?”
It was a question posed late at night — at that ungodly hour when people are free to think wild thoughts.
My first thought was yes. Yes, of course. I considered the sight of my roommate, her own smooth skin several shades darker than my own. I watched her brush her hair and wondered, “Haven’t we already decided?” She’d worn a weave since I’d met her, and the long brown locks attached to her scalp were no more hers than the hundreds of meticulous braids attached to mine. In this physical regard, we had already conformed to a European standard of beauty. How else had I already made my choice? I already raise my voice three octaves to mask the characteristic gritty speech of where I’m from. I already force myself to smile when I’ve got my hands in the pockets of my sweats, proving to the skittish Trojans on Figueroa that I’m not a threat.
Choosing to be white would mean choosing to become my polar opposite; let’s face it, white women and black women occupy two very separate ends of the American totem pole. I could become the standard of beauty to which others aspire. I could be viewed as a companion instead of a conquest. I’d escape the confines of a thousand societal assumptions — that I’m a criminal, that I’m uneducated, that I’m merely another strain on a system already stretched too thin. I could become white and forget about how tricky life would be if I weren’t.
Yet I didn’t say yes. Why? Because beneath the layers of my dark skin, I’m an incurable rebel.
“I don’t want to be white,” I finally answered, and that’s the truth of it.
An inspirational quote from political activist Angela Davis hangs over my desk: “I am no longer accepting the things I cannot change; I am changing the things I cannot accept.” I cannot change myself, and no question posed in the dark of night will ever give me the chance to do so. But what I can do — what I will do — is forever endeavor to change the world around me. Relinquishing my beloved identity will never even be a thought.

When I attended my first study abroad orientation session in December, I was told that my semester in Madrid would be like a rollercoaster. In my mind, this meant a rollercoaster of mostly exciting times, occasionally accompanied by confusion that’s triggered by the language barrier.
A glance at the graph presented to us at orientation, however, showed me that this was not the case. According to the study abroad office, culture shock produces a rollercoaster that is much more complex.
Buckle your seatbelts as you anticipate your departure. As you ascend the first hill of initial anticipation, you’ll plummet into the “arrival confusion” phase. Twisting and turning around bending unfamiliar streets and languages, you’ll suddenly spike upwards to the beloved “honeymoon” phase where every day is a breeze. As you begin to acquaint yourself with the surroundings and acclimate to the cultural differences, it won’t be long before you stop short. Your stomach will drop as you hit a wall and descend into “the plunge” that is the homesickness phase. The ride goes on with plenty more ups and downs.
For me, it was a strange idea to be told exactly how I would feel. Upon arrival to Madrid, our orientation week included similar lectures with even more metaphors describing what would be “normal” to feel. In addition to the rollercoaster, there’s also the safety, learning and panic zones, as well as the portrayal of any country besides the United States as “another planet.”
Though I’ve been in Madrid for less than two weeks, at this point I would say that my own experiences have been fairly high up on the happiness chart, and far less turbulent than any rollercoaster I’ve been on (which, in all honestly, is few — but my point still holds true). I definitely recognize that leaving home and moving outside your comfort zone is stressful. Yet, instead of anticipating the negative feelings you might have while abroad, I’ve found it is more helpful to anticipate the specific cultural differences.
The orientation session that I found most useful was one that gave us the opportunity to speak with an American who had studied abroad in Madrid and ended up staying here. She was able to relate to us about the specific activities or behavior of Spaniards that would have confused us. Experiencing cultural differences is part of the study abroad experience, but it’s beneficial to have some knowledge of the specifics in order to avoid being thrown off guard.
A few of these differences I’ve experienced thus far include the meal schedule (my host mom serves lunch at 3 p.m. and dinner at 9:30 p.m. — slightly different from my sorority kitchen’s dinners being served at 5:30 p.m.), how people greet each other (learn the double-cheek kiss!) and the fact that Spaniards stand very close to you when speaking (prepare to have your personal bubble popped).
As mentioned I’ve only been in Spain for two weeks, so I am by no means a study abroad expert. Nevertheless, the most important lesson I’ve learned so far is to be prepared to be flexible. Be flexible towards cultural differences and how you feel about them. Be flexible about learning the language — don’t get frustrated too quickly. Be flexible about being homesick — it happens. Studying abroad might be a rollercoaster, but you’re still in control of the car.

“SELFIE? SELFIE?” were the very first words I heard upon arrival in Florence, Italy — possibly one of the most magical and historic cities in all of Europe.
“No grazie,” I replied to the insistent men shoving the ubiquitous, yet ingenious, 12” mechanisms in my face as I struggled to drag my suitcases along the narrow cobblestone streets.
The cab driver had hastily dropped me off in front of the looming wooden doors of my apartment on Via Melarancio (which at the time, I could barely pronounce correctly despite the two semesters of Italian under my belt). My host school provided me with about four different keys that appeared to be of all different shapes and sizes — not to mention decades. After a good thirty minutes of struggling to open the three doors required to enter my apartment, and hauling 60 pounds of luggage up several flights of stairs, I finally made it to the quaint little place I’d call my own for the next four months. Sure, it may lack the cushy comforts of home such as dependable Wi-Fi, heat that the government doesn’t have total control over, or Netflix to lull me asleep at night, but I couldn’t be more grateful. After all — who needs social media 24/7 when you’re in FIRENZE?!
I’ve been in Florence for a little over two weeks now, and if you had to ask me how it compares to the States, I’d say I never want to leave. In fact, I’ve already begun to emotionally prepare myself for the day I have to pack up and part ways — the same way you’d prepare yourself to lose a beloved family pet to old age (okay, maybe a bit less depressing). In just two weeks, I’ve managed to make amazing friends and meet so many interesting people, interact with natives, eat authentic Italian cuisine, salsa dance, paint, order my first legal drink, get lost almost every day on my way home, eat in a bougie European McDonald’s that charges 25 cents for ketchup, catch a cold, climb the Tower of Pisa, and more. Probably one of my favorite aspects of Florence itself is the fact that it’s a small city you can walk across in about twenty minutes jam-packed with things to do, places to go, and people to see. Simply being here makes me anxious to sit still because there’s just so much to see and experience – not only in Florence, but also throughout Italy and the rest of Europe. If I’ve learned anything in these last two weeks, it’s been to seize every opportunity you can and make the most of it.
I feel like a bright-eyed bushy-tailed freshman in college all over again; it’s almost as if being overly eager is an advantage here — you’re more productive that way.
Italian Phrase of the Week: “Cogliere l’attimo!” meaning, “Seize the day!”
Ciao belli!

Jasmine Li | Daily Trojan
It was winter break; I was sitting with my knees pulled up to my chest in a cramped bedroom in the heart of Tokyo. With New Year’s just around the corner and my family far, far away, a nostalgic yearning was starting to set in. That was when I decided to book my night-bus ticket to Kanazawa.
Kanazawa is, in many ways, a relic of the past. During the Edo period, Kanazawa was a wealthy and bustling city — a jewel in the massive domain controlled by the Maeda, a formidable samurai clan. Due to its relatively peaceful history (and thus lack of bombings), today it stands largely as it has in the past — samurai mansions roughly shoving at newer apartment buildings, the narrow streets crisscrossing the landscape bringing to mind an era when horses and carriages, rather than cars, were the main means of transportation.
I made my first acquaintance with the city a year and a half ago, in the summer of 2013, as a student of a language-study program known as Princeton in Ishikawa. That had also been my very first trip to Japan itself. The next summer, I returned as an intern, writing articles for a regional newspaper headquartered at Kanazawa. Thus, for me too, Kanazawa brings back precious memories.
On the second of January, at five in the morning, I stumbled off the bus, wincing as I worked out the cricks in my neck. I was so caught up in the sorry state of my muscles that I almost didn’t notice the huge white mounds slumbering around me.
It was snowing.
I looked incredulously and them, and then at my friend, and then down at my coat, which was barely enough to brave a winter day in Los Angeles, much less subzero-winter-wonderland Kanazawa. That was why I spent the majority of that first day shopping to survive — which, may I add, is actually a common thing to do after New Year’s. Rather, the second in Japan is much like Black Friday in America, with massive sales, matched only by equally massive chaos. (In post-New-Year’s-Harajuku — a popular fashion district in Tokyo — only the law of the jungle prevails, I hear.
That night, though, I did something a little more cultural, known as初詣 (hatsumōde). Hatsumōde is a traditional visit to a shrine or a temple, done at the beginning of a new year. Holding my umbrella up as a shield against the snow, I fought my way up the steps of Oyama Shrine, towards the hall of worship, where by ringing a bell and tossing a 5-yen coin into a depository, I called upon the protecting kami (god) of the shrine and asked for a blessing. Then, I made my way back to the greater grounds and bought an omikuji, a slip of paper onto which is written your fortune for the upcoming year. It predicts everything, from health, to the recovery of lost items, to the possible appearance of “your destined one.”
I eyed the little white rectangle in my hand, sealed with good, old-fashioned glue, with quizzical amusement. Though I don’t know how much I actually believe in this sort of stuff, I treat it as a sort of lucky charm, something to grasp in moments of hardship, to gain comfort and courage from. And, starting a new year in a foreign country, separated by a vast and depthless ocean from the warmth of family and home, goodness knows how much I needed such a charm.
I broke open the seal.
“Great Fortune,” it read. “Your Wish: Though things may not go as planned at first, in the end, everything will be well. Your Awaited One: It will take a while, but they will surely come.”
I snorted quietly to myself and scanned further down. “Your Studies: Don’t worry and work hard. Your Health: Don’t fret and believe in the gods.”
The white snow continued to patter softly onto the ground, nestling in soft white patches among the eaves of the shrine. I smiled and slipped the paper into the purse.
It looks like I’m in for a great year.

German soccer club Borussia Dortmund look to respond after abysmal first half of season
How in the world did this even happen? Dortmund, previously one of Europe’s finest clubs, have somehow slipped, fallen, and slipped again in the German Bundesliga. Dortmund managed only 15 points in 17 games during the first half of the season, which is shocking, unprecedented, and—quite frankly — a little sad.
Dortmund won the German league title in the 2010-11 season, as well as the 2011-12 campaign. In the 2012-13 season, the squad turned heads during Europe’s premier club competition, the UEFA Champions League, when they clobbered perennial powerhouse Real Madrid in the semi-final en route to the final versus domestic rival Bayern Munich. Dortmund were a force. They had superstars. They were elite. That, however, can no longer be said about Jürgen Klopp’s squad, a group now floundering and desperately searching for a lifeline.
It is hard to think of another club in modern European soccer that has experienced such an extreme decline in such a short time frame. This team is in the relegation zone. And it makes almost no sense.
Dortmund’s decline is at least somewhat personnel-related. Their diminishing quality of on-field product represents the undeniable truth that sustained success in European soccer is nearly impossible when playing the “little brother” role. Dortmund are Bayern Munich’s little brother, and they are bullied both on the field and in the transfer market. Dortmund have lost its two best players in recent history — Robert Lewandowski and Mario Götze — to Bayern Munich. Bayern are casually sitting on 45 points (yes, 30 more than Dortmund) as we near the commencement of the second half of the season.
Bayern Munich and Borussia Dortmund provided a thrilling contest at the Allianz Arena on Nov. 1. Dortmund lost 2-1 on the road, but the team showed life. It was a rare sight. Dortmund have been moribund in basically every other league game this season. With a league-high 10 losses, Dortmund clearly lack the allure and reputation they enjoyed just a short while ago.
Italian striker Ciro Immobile has struggled to replace recently departed star goal scorer Robert Lewandowski. Meanwhile, Marco Reus — undoubtedly the most talented player on the team—has dealt with a number of injuries of late, most recently an ankle injury that kept him sidelined until the new year. Despite the fact that European clubs with ungodly transfer budgets, such as Bayern Munich, will certainly continue to exploit Dortmund and likely sign the club’s best players for years to come, it is still easy to wonder just exactly how Dortmund has tumbled this far. This is a team with a fantastic coach, Klopp, who is adored by the fans. Dortmund have explosive players, such as speedster Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang. Plus, the defense is anchored by German international Mats Hummels, who is arguably one of the strongest center backs in the game today. The team has looked sharp in the Champions League, where they prepare to face Italian giants Juventus in the Round of 16. Still, the squad’s ongoing struggles in league play pose a major concern.
Dortmund will inevitably improve. They are just too talented. Just too well-coached. Right?
Fifteen points in 17 games is an embarrassment, and for a club of this caliber, the threat of relegation should never have come into play in the first place. They will be back, but their turnaround will certainly take much longer than their unexpected, rapid downfall. Dortmund’s goal differential is minus-eight. Bayern Munich’s is plus-37. Enough said.
Josh Cohen is a freshman majoring in broadcast and digital journalism. His column, “The SCoreboard,” runs Mondays. 
And now it’s even worse… I don’t know why Dortmund is so weak in the Bundesliga. They can’t pass the ball, they can’t kick it to the most appropriate person on the field, they have so much problems with creating their chances and they don’t play as a team, they play like a group of 11 strangers. Klopp likes to build his starting XI with the same players everytime and this is one of the reasons why do they have so many injuries. This text of Josh Cogen gives me hope but the most important now is to move on, die Schwarzgelben!

A couple days ago, midway through my morning routine of checking all my social media platforms, I came across a Buzzfeed article. A young woman had started a social experiment, “Whenever a boy compliments you, agree with him.”
In many of the conversations she posted, the boy would compliment her on her looks, she’d reply with a “yes,” then receive ridiculous replies back. And by ridiculous, I don’t mean to antagonize these men, but it’s just flimsy logic when someone says “U are gorgeous” and follows with “I mean no u arent lol” after the woman agrees. From those examples, Gweneth Bateman commented that she couldn’t believe how it’s “perfectly OK for women to doubt a compliment they receive, [but] when they actually believe [it]…, they get shamed and branded as ‘vain’ or ‘conceited’.”
Now I know I might not do some of my best thinking in the mornings, but even while I was half-awake, I sensed there was something a little unreliable with the conclusion from this experiment. Don’t get me wrong, I’m also a female and I understand that guys are often sorely mistaken in believing that they are entitled to our attention. On the other hand, is this confusion about how to receive a compliment really only limited to romantic interaction? If I complimented my grandmother and said, “That’s a very nice dress, Grandma” and she replied with, “Why, yes dear, I know,” I wouldn’t exactly be pleased with the development of that conversation either –– and that’s not involving any element of romance or male-female power dynamics.
In my eyes, this social experiment is not the best way to prove that men feel uncomfortable with women’s confidence. If anything, this is an interesting study in the social phenomenon of giving and receiving compliments, but I personally don’t see it as a threat to the feminist cause.

After watching this week’s college football playoff national championship game in which Ohio State defeated Oregon, it became clear to me that a blueprint on how to derail the Oregon juggernaut emerged. This is big news for USC, which plays the Ducks in Eugene next year. What Ohio State did to an Oregon team that destroyed nearly every team they encountered this season was impressive. The fact that the buckeyes did it with ten days of preparation makes the feat even more remarkable.
How did Ohio State manage to slow down the warp speed Oregon attack? It was a combination of offensive and defensive strategies.
Offensively, the Buckeyes were excellent on third and fourth down, thereby extending drives. Additionally, they were extremely successful at establishing the running game. The combination of both strategies contributed to Oregon’s potent offense staying on the sideline. As the adage goes, the best defense is a good offense.
Defensively, the Buckeyes were able to pressure Heisman winner Marcus Mariota with a variety of blitzes. Teams that have success against Oregon’s system are able to dominate the line of scrimmage. In order to do so, the defensive lineman must be able to push Oregon’s offensive lineman behind the line of scrimmage very quickly. Elite defensive lineman, athletes who often weigh over 300 pounds yet still maintain enough agility to brush off blocks, are needed.
Recruiting elite defensive lineman is difficult since the combination of size and speed is rare. Furthermore, data suggests those elite defensive linemen are concentrated, overwhelmingly, in the South.
The teams that have given Oregon trouble in recent years: Ohio State, LSU, USC, Auburn. The one thing all these schools have in common is their ability to recruit elite defensive lineman due to a combination of their location and prestige in the mind of recruits. As a result, part of the success of Oregon’s offense can be contributed to the relative lack of defensive line depth and talent in the West Coast.
In order for USC to reassert its dominance over Oregon, it needs to be able to recruit and develop top-notch defensive lineman.

Rand Paul has been sucked deeper into the loony lagoon.
Despite being busy advocating for a return to the gold standard, claiming Ebola can be contained through free market mechanisms and asserting that the Department of Education is unconstitutional, Rand Paul has decided to make another wild assertion — that vaccinations should be voluntary because they cause “mental disorders.”
For starters, there is no link whatsoever between vaccines and mental disorders. As a matter of fact, the CDC reports, “There is strong evidence that MMR [measles, mumps, rubella] vaccine is not associated with autism.” One would think that Paul, a trained medical professional, would have learned the fundamentals of human biology (or at least how to read a peer reviewed academic journal), and publicly supported the scientific consensus that vaccines are incredibly beneficial substances that effectively combat highly contagious and often deadly diseases. Evidently not.
But allow us to accept this completely and utterly false premise that vaccines cause mental disorders. What would happen if people completely stopped vaccinating their children?
Before the polio vaccine was created, half a million people worldwide were killed or paralyzed every year from the illness. Before the mumps vaccine, over 150,000 mumps cases were reported every year, a disease that causes complications like permanent deafness. Smallpox, before it was eradicated through vaccines, would blind and kill as much as 60 percent of those infected with it. So which is better? Mentally handicapped, or paralyzed, blind, deaf or dead?
What is most upsetting about Paul’s announcement is that, besides spreading dangerous misinformation, it politicizes medical and scientific fact. Less than 24 hours after President Obama encouraged parents to vaccinate their children, Paul made his statement. To assert that this action was done out of a concern for “freedom” and not a chance to politically polarize himself from the President is absurd.
There are some places that politics do not belong, especially in muddying scientific truths that protect the health and safety of this nation. Paul, in his eagerness for volunteerism, should realize it’s time for him to voluntarily shut up.

The start of a new year brings resolutions of a fresh start — the desire to lead a healthier life, be mentally tough and maybe sleep a little more than you did the previous year. Sound familiar? Setting realistic goals is difficult to do, especially living in a generation like ours where we are so stop and go. Luckily, there are resources on campus to help you stay healthy and motivated this spring. One way to stay healthy, both physically and mentally, is by joining one of the many health related clubs on campus. Surrounding yourself with like-minded individuals can help promote daily health in your life.
Mindful USC. Mindful USC is a new university-wide initiative, which aims to make mindfulness practices integral to the culture of the Trojan Family. Mindfulness is described as being present, focused and aware of our day-to-day functioning, which can lead to stress reduction and workplace happiness. Mindful USC works to increase attentiveness in the classroom, deepen the quality of teaching and learning, and encourage creativity and innovation. The biggest organization/club that works to promote this are Wellness Advocates. WA’s are student volunteers who are trained to listen to, connect with, and respond to questions from their peers about wellness. They run the Student Resource Center at the Engemann Health Center and are also trained to provide skill building to reduce stress in a positive and engaging manner with student groups throughout the USC community. The WA community is one that fosters health and wellness in a positive way.
USC Yoga and Mediation Club. This club helps Trojans enhance their strength and flexibility in a fun way. It encourages members to try new techniques even if they haven’t been exposed to Yoga or Meditation before. The non-judgmental environment evokes confidence and is a light and engaging way to stay active while still feeling healthy. By combining yoga and meditation they are highlighting both our emotional and physical well-being.
USC Club Sports. USC offers a variety of sports, more than 58, and are geared for athletes who are competitive and want to enjoy athletics in college, but not on as high of a level as a varsity team. Most club sports practice 2-3 times per week with games every few weekends. It is a great way to stay healthy, but still be able to focus your energy in other places.
NAMI, National Allience on Mental Illness. Their main goal is to help build better lives for college students struggling with mental illness. NAMI advocates for access to services, treatment, supports and research on campus and is an open and safe place for students to discuss mental health topics. Similar to it is another mental health advocacy organization: Active Minds at USC. Their purpose is to increase awareness among students about issues of mental health, symptoms of mental illness and available resources. They focus on shedding light to psychiatric disorders, like depression, bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, eating disorders, PTSD, and generalized anxiety disorders
 “I am That Girl.” This club is one that I have recently joined and hold near and dear to my heart. ‘I am That Girl’ strives to help women transform self-doubt into self-love by providing a safe space to be lifted up and have honest conversations about things that matter. “That girl” is the best version of herself and is beautiful in every way.
 Trojan Health Connection and USC Public Health Brigades. These two advocacy groups focus on educating communicates on public health topics. They aim to promote credible and meaningful advice to USC students with a pre-health emphasis and even expand their assistance past the United States Borders.
Joining any of these clubs on campus will not only make you feel whole and healthy, but more involved in life at USC.

College football’s quest for a system to determine a worthy champion has been a long one — from the traditional AP national champion to the Bowl Coalition to the BCS, and now, a four-team playoff. The playoff has been an enormous success bringing in more revenue and higher ratings. There is no question the playoff is not only a financial success but also a success for the game of college football.
In the BCS system, Florida State and Alabama would have battled it out for the national championship, but neither of those teams played in the CFP championship game. Ohio State earned the 2015 national championship more than any team that came before them. Not only that, but the success of college football in America is also due largely to the stakes of every game to the national championship picture, and the intensity of every game throughout the first season of the college football playoff was through the roof.
Nonetheless, this still begs the question of whether four teams are enough to determine a true champion. During the first year a playoff was held, the lowest seed in the field won the championship. Those, such as former football player Mark May, say that college football just got a new system and needs to give it at least several years. Others say it must expand to eight teams eventually, but what about six?
History shows that four teams are not enough to determine the best team in college football at the end of the regular season, and there were several No. 5 and No. 6 teams in history that were in the running for the best college football team that season. TCU fans and Baylor fans would agree with that statement. This past season’s TCU’s team only lost at No. 5 Baylor and walked over No. 9 Ole Miss team in the Peach Bowl. Baylor had the best win of any of the top 6 teams beating TCU. Both these teams were, without a doubt, part of the discussion of the best teams in America by the end of the season.
Furthermore, after the 2013 season, No. 5 Pac-12 champion Stanford and No. 6 Big 12 champion Baylor were in the running for the best teams that season. The year before that No. 5 Kansas State won the Big 12 and would have been in the national championship game if it was not for an awful performance at Baylor, and No. 6 Stanford was without a doubt one of the hottest teams to end the season and was the only team to beat No.4 Oregon. These are all championship-caliber teams that never got a chance to compete for a national championship.
The playoff should thus be expanded to six teams, but eight teams in a playoff might be too much and would dilute the stakes of the college football regular season. This year’s No. 7 and 8 teams were Michigan State’s and Mississippi State Teams. In all, Michigan State beat Jacksonville St., Eastern Michigan, Wyoming, Nebraska, Purdue, Indiana, Michigan, Maryland, Rutgers and Penn State while losing to national champion Ohio State and runner-up Oregon. Their best win had been against a mediocre Nebraska team only four of these teams were bowl eligible. Mississippi State beat Southern Miss, UAB, South Alabama, LSU, Texas A&M, Auburn, Kentucky, Arkansas, UT Martin and Vanderbilt, but lost to SEC champion Alabama, who earned a playoff berth, and No.9 Ole Miss. Their best win were against No. 19 Auburn and No. 23 LSU.
There is no doubt the two are good teams, but both had chances to prove their worth against championship-caliber teams yet failed. Putting teams like these in a playoff takes away from the intense every-game-counts atmosphere that college football has thrived on. Teams would not have to win games against top 10 teams, but just beat the Nebraska’s and Auburn’s of this year to make the playoff. Regular season top 10 or top 5 matchups would not be played for a spot in the playoff but simply determine the seeding of the teams. If teams like Michigan State and Mississippi State can afford to lose to teams inside the top 20 and beat the rest of the opponents on its schedule, the intense atmosphere of every college football game goes away, and the sport changes from every game counts to most games count.
Fielding a playoff is not just about determining the teams with the best bodies of work and best resumes, but as Ohio State shown this year, it’s about finding the hottest teams at the end of the season. As a result, I would put forth the argument for a six-team playoff. Several sports in the NCAA use it already (such as water polo). It is the perfect way to maintain the intensity of the college football season while at the same time discovering a true champion while expanding the revenues, ratings and the intensity of the college football season.

Since starting my semester here at USC, I have found myself looking forward to Wednesdays for one reason: loading up on fresh fruits and veggies. The weekly farmer’s market held at McCarthy Quad offers a wide variety of food and crafts, and during my first visit, my eyes were immediately drawn to a table full of shades of blue and red.
I love to pick up a basket or two of berries because I know I can easily work them into meals and snacks. This week I decided to pick up blueberries not only because they are incredibly tasty and easy to eat by the handful, but also because the little berries are chock-full of health benefits too.
According to Medical Daily, blueberries are packed with antioxidants and vitamins. The little berries are proven to strengthens immune health, reduces risk of cancer, helps fight UTIs, and improves cardiovascular health and — guess what students — some studies have shown blueberries boost brain health as well!
Because I love blueberries and because breakfast is the most important meal of the day, here are a few of my favorite morning recipes and pointers I’d like to share with you.
If you snoozed your alarm clock one too many times this morning, and you’re running a bit late for that G.E., no worries — a quick and easy to make blueberry parfait will help you get your day started right!
Parfaits are easy to make because you can add whatever you want (or whatever you can find in your fridge or pantry.) Pick out your favorite yogurt, wash and dry a handful of blueberries, and add other toppings if you’d like. Personally, I like to start out with low-fat vanilla yogurt as a base, and then I add berries or other fresh fruit, granola and almonds or walnuts. A teaspoon of honey doesn’t hurt either!

So you didn’t hit the snooze button this morning, but you are feeling a bit tired before class.
Well, what better way to start your day than with a smoothie? Like parfaits, there is no “right way” to make a smoothie, but my suggestion would be to pick a base such as yogurt, almond milk, or even water, pick a fruit (I’d suggest blueberries here of course) and smoothies are also a great way to get in not-so-great tasting vegetables like kale or other dark, leafy greens. A sweetener, protein powder, vitamins, etc can also be added. For a great smoothie guide, check out this.
Also, here’s a great smoothie in my opinion, because the fresh fruit easily masks the kale.
So you’ve got a good amount of time before class this morning, and you’re up for making something sweet and cozy. My recommendation: a quinoa breakfast bowl. For a protein-packed, warm and yummy breakfast, check out this recipe.#more
I cook and sweeten the quinoa according to the directions, but I normally add blueberries and banana slices on top of mine!

It’s Sunday, thank God. Your friends are coming over for a late brunch because no one set their alarms this morning, and you’ve still got a basket left of blueberries. Why not go all out and make a blueberry breakfast crumble?
This recipe is one of my all-time favorites. The ingredient list is pretty straightforward and the end result is so satisfying and worth the post cleanup. I love the crispy crumble that covers the moist and fluffy blueberry cake, just be careful to not getting the crumble too warm before covering the batter or else the butter will melt into the crumble rather than crisp up!

Voila!

Here’s to wonderful mornings that are blue in a different way! Eat those berries and improve that brain health, Trojans!

As a student of a university located in one of America’s most vibrant cities, I’ve always found it strange that many students — particularly first-years — don’t take advantage of all the local happenings as much as they could. As a native New Yorker, I’m perplexed by the idea of wanting to stay within a college bubble. Even as young children, we would explore all of our city’s neighborhoods: on foot, on bike and via public transportation. These adventures we had were even often shared free of charge. We’d peek into corner stores and make plans to go window-shopping. And when we saw new establishments taking over all that was old and familiar, we’d rummage past the early construction and blacked-out windows and inquire as to what would be coming next.
Like many students who come to Los Angeles from other metropolitan areas, I was disappointed to find that our public transportation here really, really isn’t the optimal way to get around. Though this may have been the understatement of the year and often keeps our car-less young’uns in the neighborhood, one positive aspect of this is that our campus remains spirited and lively. But in spite of ensuring that USC’s campus culture is alive and well, it’s dually important (and rewarding) to become acquainted with the eclectic sprawl of this city that surrounds us, one that is in the height of its development, evolving before us daily.
Upon this realization, I made a vow to myself a while back that I would try once a week to “live Los Angeles” in some way that I hadn’t prior. This could be in the form of checking out a new concert venue, seeing a gallery show with friends, or more often for me, trying to find some really great food.
Early on in the semester, a friend first brought me to Eggslut. As an aficionado of all eggs cooked in all forms, my life was transformed.
A self-described “chef driven, gourmet food concept,” Eggslut aims to cater to those of you who (hopefully) love eggs as much as I do. The menu takes what once was a mere breakfast staple and nurtures it to appeal to burger lovers, foodies and health freaks alike, making the egg a fully accessible all-day dining item. Widely Instagrammed favorites include the Slut — a coddled egg on top of a smooth potato purée, poached in a jar to be served with a baguette — and the more traditional Eggslut Cheeseburger — a flavor-heavy blend of ground American wagyu beef, caramelized onions, bread and butter pickles, cheddar cheese and dijonnaise, topped with an over medium egg in a warm brioche bun. Though the menu includes options that appeal to food lovers of many backgrounds and preferences, in true L.A. fashion, salad can be substituted for bread at no extra charge and avocado can be slipped into even the most overstuffed sandwiches.
Developed in 2011 by Executive Chef Alvin Cailan, a graduate of the Oregon Culinary Institute, Eggslut sought to find the happy medium between culinary comfort and innovation. Their mission details their goal of creating food that constitutes more than a meal, but instead, an experience. This is done by directing attention to not only how the food tastes, but also how it looks and the manner in which it’s presented. At Eggslut, customers are presented with dishes that are ingredient-heavy and unique, but they also have a great deal of freedom to customize their options as they wish.
Eggslut shares the Homer Laughlin Building, or the Grand Central Market, with about 30 other vendors. As L.A.’s first and largest public market, Grand Central still continues on with its 98 year-old mission to celebrate and unite the city of L.A. through cuisine and culture.
On weekend mornings and afternoons, long lines leading up to Eggslut snake through the market’s narrow walkways. As students and other hungry Angelenos wait impatiently to start their days, kitchen employees are hard at work frying, poaching, and serving up a mean cold brew too. Those who have been lucky enough to finally pick up their orders leave the market to enjoy the meals under the red umbrellas on Broadway, or perhaps they continue to scour the market, to find the accompanying iced coffee or smoothie. Regardless, more visitors will amble on in to Grand Central Market, likely stopping to notice the lit-up yellow Eggslut sign.
If you’re a true fan of all things egg, you’ll have no trouble bracing the short Metro ride downtown to check this place out. Grand Central Market’s hours are 8 a.m. to 6 p.m. Sundays through Wednesdays, and 8 a.m. to 9 p.m. Thursdays through Saturdays.

Even with the sun shining and the weather reads 75 degrees here in Southern California, the perfect day is not always around. For those inevitable lows of our life remember these pieces of advice and find solace in some relaxing places at USC.
Chances are the lows of a bad day that you experienced will not matter five or ten years from now. It’s important to remind yourself that it is all-relative and taking a step back when you are hurting or overwhelmed is important to make yourself happy.
Things to keep in mind and visit when the world is on your shoulders:
1) You are alive. You have a beating heart and a functioning brain and you are privileged with being able to breathe in the beautiful air everyday. Compare your life to someone in Africa for example, you are healthy, with a bed to sleep in at night and food to eat. Go to one of the top levels in TCC. You can a beautiful view of campus there and catch some really pretty sunsets. It’s also usually quiet, which is always a plus.
2) You matter to somebody and you are loved. If you’re feeling blue, recall a time where you and a loved one laughed so hard your stomach hurt. Isn’t it nice to know that you’ve brought joy to someone’s life in some capacity? You are an important person in this world whether that is to your family, friends or maybe your puppy dog — you are loved so much. Go sit near Traveler by the fountain. People-watching is something that never disappoints and can make you feel calm so easily.
3) You and only you are in charge of your own happiness. Joy is something that you bring to yourself. You decide when you want to go out and make a difference, you decide when you want to stay home and take time for yourself. You are your own pilot. If you are having a day that just is not going, as you would have hoped, it is up to you to turn it around. Be mentally tough. Try a yoga class at the Lyon center to clear your head — they are refreshing and rejuvenating.
4) There is such a thing as random acts of kindness. Just thinking about that makes me smile. The other day I was tired, but rallied myself to finish my laundry. When I went to the drying machine to take out my clothes they were perfectly folded on top of the dryer with a note that said “I hope you have a good day!” Having a resurgence of hope in humanity is always a good thing and thinking about myself reciprocating that good thing to someone else really warms my heart.
You have so many amazing things to look forward to. Your life has barely begun and one bad day is not defining of your future! Remind yourself that this life is long and this life is good. Not to spoil the ending, but everything is going to be okay.

Whenever I hear people discuss movies, a solid three out of five times I’ll hear someone mention a superhero franchise. Did you watch The Avengers? Or The Guardians of the Galaxy? That one where Chris Evans is super ripped?
As a film student, I’ve heard my fair share of criticism about these types of movies — and it’s always followed up with a comment about the sordid state our generation. Our generation prefers spectacle over story, explosions over characters. Movies are becoming less real and more fantastical, they say.
Nevertheless, I completely surrender myself to the appeal of the superheroes — the iron-willed protagonists save the world from destruction. What’s not to like? I agree that they’re unrealistic and they do tend to polarize the world into good and evil. It’s “simple.” But there is absolutely nothing simple about the role of superhero movies in our lives.
These fantastical movies feed us what we crave — a world where humans are absolutely crucial in determining the fate of humanity, the Earth and even the universe. We crave it because of a very straightforward, but uncomfortable truth — our generation is insecure. We have pushed the concept of individuality so far that we don’t know where we fall in the order of things anymore. Social institutions like religion, government, and even the family, are brought into question. No wonder it’s difficult for us to gauge where we stand.
Nonetheless, there’s no need to shame our generation for the movies we like. Once in a while, we do need a Chris Evans to save the world for us.

Film
Most likely, seeing Pulp Fiction as a fetus accounts for your precocity and is probably what made you want to major in film at age four. This is something a film student would never admit because it clashes the edgy, filmmaker archetype devised by none other than the filmmaker his or herself. As a Cinema student, you automatically disagree with everything; opinions are too blockbuster. All movies try too hard or are too unoriginal, except yours of course. Between breaths, you use words like ‘aesthetic’ and ‘lampoon’ (catch the Lena Dunham reference) because you are the perfect combination of smart and artsy. While these students are flawed in their fedora wearing ways, they also are among the elite number of students who are only admitted to one of the best cinema schools in the nation but they also hone in their craft with real Hollywood professionals. Guess you could say, being a film major is kind of a big deal.


Communications
Communications is a major crafted exclusively to suit its student’s special skills set: waiting in line at Nektar. Just kidding. Like business majors, Annenberg students are disliked by other majors as they are basically a coalition of the most attractive people on campus. Communication majors divide their time equally between partying and working at the best internships in LA. The only thing longer than the amount of time a Communication major spends walking down the Greek Row is his or her resume.

Engineering
These people never leave Viterbi. Mainly because they can’t. Welcome to the hardest major on campus. Engineering students travel in small packs, because about one-third of registered students drop their classes. Moreover, Viterbi students are the only people still watching the Big Bang Theory. To the outside world, every girl studying science is automatically Hermione  from Harry Potter regardless of appearance, and every boy, Bill Nye the Science Guy. While these character types are extremely accurate, realistically speaking students of all other majors will end up working for engineering majors. Next time, you are at SAL computer lab printing your paper last minute make sure to stop by and introduce yourself to your future boss. It is great networking. Fight on!



Business
Business majors are very easy to spot because they like to match the suit they wear to school every other day to their huge egos. But seriously, what’s up with the suits? Disliked by every other major on campus, they are notoriously known for attending one of the most prestigious schools at USC, yet almost never doing anything school related. Never ask a Marshall student what they are studying, because as a business student, the answer will always be nothing.
 
Business majors usually reside poolside while they fill out their own entrepreneurship surveys. Do not be phased by the ‘business casual’ lifestyle; they are only spending their college experience doing nothing because they are saving every ounce of energy for when they are making 200,000k a year.

 

Music
Music majors are the coolest people on campus. All of these students are essentially Damien from Mean Girls reincarnated into the type of person who sits on the grass by Bing Theater barefoot. They live in Ground Zero and actually go to the performing art events.

Philosophy
Philosophy students go to class only three times per semester. Although when they do show up, these students keep their hand raised the entire time. After a while, it becomes clear that they have formulated a series of scapegoats for in class discussion to make up for truancy. Next time, you are sitting next to a philosophy student, keep tally of all of the times they tangent off to (1) Greco-Roman Antiquity, (2) Etymology or Latin roots of words, or (3) Nihilism (a crowd favorite). These are the kinds of people who drink Peet’s Coffee and actually like it. Nevertheless, their quick, witty, conversational, and out-of-the-box thinking styles not only enable them to prosper in any academic or vocational context but also in social settings. If you are ever feel like having a mid-life crisis, talk to a philosophy major. 

Pre-med
Pre-med students are everything our mothers wanted us to be and so much more. They are always vigorously studying. The only difference between a drunk person and a pre-med student at USC is the drunk can wake up sober; pre-med students never sleep.

Dance 
I have never met a student studying dance at USC. Here’s my best guess: 

Broadcast Journalism 
The most commonly coined phrase by a Broadcast major is “I’m a Broadcast major.” No really, they love to talk about themselves (think Ron Burgundy); in fact, instead of downloading music, they actually listen to pre-recorded sound bites of their own voice. They rarely speak softly, as they are always with purpose, over-enunciating constant sounds in confidence. You will never be bored, because every conversation is like a long weather report. All jokes aside, these students are ‘the movers and the shakers’ of USC, and their go-getter personalities and journalistic prowess actually allows them to kill job interviews, tackle public speaking, and spice up banal networking conversations.
