Twenty years ago, on April 29, riots broke out in the city of Los Angeles not far from campus. The 1992 Los Angeles riots carried on for six days after the acquittal of four Los Angeles Police Department officers who were videotaped beating a man after a high-speed chase. The ruling incited a citywide violent protest declaring justice had not been served.
Businesses were looted, homes burned down and 53 lives were taken as a result of the racial tension and uprising. The National Guard, U.S. Army and Marines were called into the city to help quell the riots and protect the city.

Erna Smith, a professor of journalism who conducted a study on the media coverage of the L.A. riots, said she found animosity between races boiling before the beating of Rodney King.
“Prior to the not-guilty verdicts in the Rodney King beatings, there had been several high-profile cases that exacerbated racial tensions, including the shooting of a black teenage girl by a Korean shop keeper who was sentenced to probation,” Smith said.
The L.A. riots, however, crossed racial boundaries as victims and businesses of all races were targeted. Damages amounted to nearly $1 billion, according to Time magazine.
Joseph Saltzman, a professor of journalism, said USC handled the immediate danger in the South Central area with concern to the students.
“The university reacted very well in calming fears, adding more security and holding various meetings with students and faculty so everyone had the best possible, latest information,” Saltzman said. “Panic and fear usually [come] from the unknown, so by getting information out quickly, it helped calm everyone down.”
Bryce Nelson, a professor of journalism, said students took part in the aftermath of the riot by helping with the cleanup.
“USC always hoped to and worked to build a stronger relationship with the neighborhood,” Nelson said. “It was strong before that, but it played an increasing role after the riot.”
Though USC’s academic standing and admissions were expected to be affected by the L.A. riots, Nelson said there was no damage to the school’s reputation.
With the 20th anniversary of the riots approaching, Smith said it is important to realize the severity of racial issues in Los Angeles.
“Unfortunately, race, in particular institutional racism, still matters a lot in this county,” Smith said. “And it will continue to matter if the only time we talk about it is when there’s riots.”
Twenty years ago I came to work as usual unaware that all Hell was going to break loose as soon as I began patrol.
That day I was assigned to Field Service Patrol with  the Supervisor for Residential Protection as my ride along.
Our officers on duty did their best to protect all of the SC students and community when the “Riots” hit.  I saw the incidents first hand. The Trojan family stuck together when the going got tough. They also got right in there and did there best to help those in need afterwards.
It is very nice to hear the kind words from former students who were there about our efforts to defend them. I know how difficult it was during this historic time.
Hopefully you all went on to make the world a better place. “Fight On!”
I was a sophomore at USC that spring. I was at my work-study internship at the USC Admissions Office. Our director came down to the office to announce that the university was shutting down, something I couldn’t fathom. He had a uniformed officer  pick me up in a squad car and drive me to my off-campus apartment. My roommates and I smelled the smoke and watched the drama unfold from our Cardinal Gardens balcony and my little 19-inch TV. We kept flipping around the channels to watch the action and to see if finals, which were scheduled to start the next morning, were going to be cancelled. We saw the flash of gunfire out on Jefferson & McClintock that left a man laying dead in the streets for the rest of the night. We saw nearly every building on Vermont aflame. We saw the USC parking gates closed and locked, armed officers just inside, standing guard. At about midnight, I got a call from my editor at the Daily Trojan that she was negotiating with the administration to let us come back to campus and put out a special issue. Another hour later, my journalism prof, herself a newspaper assistant editor, called me back to say her final scheduled for 8 am was cancelled.
The next morning at 11, driving away from our apartment on our way to a friend’s house in Santa Monica, I passed shops and gas stations still burning and smoldering but emptied of their merchandise. I saw the ash covering the swings and playground at Vermont Avenue School, where I’d been volunteering all semester. I wondered if my students would ever come back.
A day later, I was back on the 4th floor of the Student Union, watching the rising smoke from our vantage point and producing a DT issue that still today makes me very proud. The following fall semester, my SOCI 320 class had been renamed “The Social Psychology of the L.A. Riots.” Dr. Vern Bengtson, a remarkable USC sociologist and gerontologist, connected our academic learning to real-world exploration of the riots through guest speakers such as then-LA Times City Editor Leo Wolinsky, then-LAPD Deputy Chief Bernard Parks, and then-USC President Steven Sample. To ensure that the university and its students stay connected to those events, my DT colleagues and I wrote many more articles about the university’s response to the riots that next year. 
It was an unbelievable week to be a USC Trojan and a resident of South L.A. Twenty years later, I commend the DT and academic departments who continue to open up lines of dialogue across campus and around the city to discuss, learn, and hopefully grow from the riots.
I was a freshman at ‘SC living in Marks Hall in Spring 1992. It was hot and humid for April. As the verdict was announced that afternoon — being lil’ geek girls — we tried to continue studying. I remember sitting in the hallway  of the dorm that evening hearing gunshots. 
Finals became “optional.” 95% or more of the student body left.  I don’t remember how or win the announcements were made. The DT published a special issue. People just started leaving. I was from out-of-state. Friends offered to have me come stay with them in Orange County. Even one of my Thematic Option writing instructor called me and offered a place if I wanted to get away from campus. I was one of the handful who stuck around. History was happening around us.
Less than 24hrs after the riots began the CA Army National Guard were deployed and eventually were housed at the Coliseum. For those of us who remained on campus, EVK was opened to the LAPD and the National Guard. Active duty soldiers from the Army (Ft Ord 7th infantry) and active duty Marines were being deployed to South Central (by order of the President). A battalion of Marines were eventually deployed in LA. 
Those of who stayed on campus were (relatively) safe and protected. There were students in the University-owned apts north of campus who reported being chased and threatened.
The Payless and the Baskin-Robbins north of campus were looted. When 32nd Street Market (Third World Market) was reopened finally, there were National Guardsman only allowing in specific numbers of people.
As an 18-yo from a rural Midwest town, it was history.
I was a Senior in 1992, preparing for finals and getting ready for my graduation, when the riots hit.  We were on lock down and anyone that could get out was told to do so.  USC security did a fantastic job of holding down the fort.  Friends and roommates stood on the rooftops of our buildings, watching the helicopters above, talking to parents on the phone, trying to convince everyone we were okay.  There was one pizza place that would deliver the day after, but they wouldn’t get out of the car and you had to be downstairs waiting for them with cash when they arrived.  Graduation in May was extra special.  We had all watched what had happened, returned to campus to celebrate our hard work, and made plans to help rebuild the community that had sustained the brunt of the anger of the day.  I have always been proud to be a Trojan…but never as proud as I was with the way they handled the riots.  In the days before text alerts, blast e-mail and cell phones, we were safe and well taken care of.  Kudos to everyone who was there 20 years ago and thank you.
It angers me when any articles about the rioting become softened by euphemisms like “Civil Disturbance”. I am glad the DT is using the right term – a RIOT.
Not enough is being said condemning the actions of these violent criminals that decided to burn the city down. Lives were ruined and some families still suffer from the aftermath two decades later. however, we are afraid to call out these animals that chimped out in our city because we have become such cowardly, politically correct, mealy-mouthed hypocrites. These same thugs that rioted like feral animals have contributed to WHY WE PROFILE WHETHER WE ADMIT IT OR NOT!!!! All one has to do is see footage from the riots and see who was doing the killing, looting and beating.
Having been around SC when the riots happened, I remember exactly what USC told people,  “Get the F-out of here!”  For the most part everybody did leave.   There were no phantom meetings and virtually no communication from SC despite the happy talk you read above.  The campus went on lock down and pretty much nobody came in or left.   Rioting occurred all around the campus but not on the campus as campus security defended all the entry points.    The businesses on Figueroa were hit pretty hard especially the strip mall at 28th and Figueroa which was pretty much cleaned out.

This article was originally published May 4, 1992, in a special edition of the Daily Trojan. The city will remember the 20th anniversary of the Los Angeles riots on April 29. 
Eleven students have been injured or arrested in the rioting, Security reports said. No students have been injured seriously, but a local man was shot in the leg on Exposition Boulevard in front of Parkside Apartments Wednesday night.
Students were evacuated from their apartments north of campus due to power outages, and some property damage has been reported at Regal Trojan Apartments and buildings on 27th Street, but the extent of the damage has not yet been confirmed.
“Rooms are open, doors have been pried open … reports should be trickling in today, with students coming back and finals scheduled for Monday,” said Sgt. John Lewis of University Security.
Power was restored by the Department of Water and Power as of 11 a.m. Sunday morning, Lewis said.
“I got my TV, my phone and my answering machine stolen,” said Brandon Bandhauer, a junior majoring in creative writing and biology who lives in Regal Trojan.
“But it looks like we were not the only ones who got anything stolen,” he said. “Other screens have been pulled off, but our windows don’t lock properly, and that’s how they got in.”
“The university is very fortunate that there has been no significant damage,” Lewis said. “The damage has been nothing even close to the magnitude on the street.”
“I’m amazed that not one thing has happened,” Lt. David Ritch said. “Physical Plant, Safety … all service are really networking together.”
Administrators have taken an active role in trying to assess the situation. President Steven Sample and other top administrators have been on campus throughout the crisis.
Sample fielded phone calls to his office that threatened to “burn USC down.”
Sample and James Dennis, vice president of Student Affairs, stayed on campus with the command center until the end of last week. They also ate at EVK Dining Hall with students and faculty, many of whom had been evacuated from their normal residences.
Sample also rode along with Ritch on a routine security patrol Thursday.
“Everything seemed calm,” Ritch said. “But then we drove into the worst looting I’d seen. People were jumping over the hood of the car. I had my gun in my hand. I’m a Vietnam vet, and this was pretty bad.”
Ritch said that Sample’s eyes were as big as his head.
The fires reported on campus were minor.
A fire in a dumpster near the construction site behind Bovard Administration Building was put out by security on Wednesday night, according to Ritch.
“We put it out with extinguishers from our vehicles, and we got every fire extinguisher out of the new part of Bovard,” Ritch said.
An officer remained on the scene after the fire was put out and poured water on the smoldering dumpster with a garden hose found among the construction equipment until all the embers had been extinguished, Ritch said.
“We now have a pickup truck full of every fire extinguisher we could get our hands on in case something else happens,” Ritch said.
A student also put out a small fire in Grace Ford Salvatori Hall.
Greg Sandoval, a senior majoring in creative writing, was walking by the building, saw the small blaze and extinguished it by beating it out with his backpack.
“I rushed in to find a stack of College U. newspapers completely ablaze,” Sandoval said.
“I tried to stomp it out, but then had to beat it out with my backpack,” he said.
Sandoval said he had the fire almost extinguished when University Security officers arrived and put it out with fire extinguishers
Lewis said no students were seriously injured during the riots that followed Wednesday’s announcement of the acquittal of the four police officers accused of using excessive force on Rodney King.
A male student was jumped Wednesday night at 7 p.m. while biking down 35th Street west of Hoover, Lewis said.
“A suspect pulled him off his bike and then a group of teenagers arrived and kicked and beat him on the ground,” Lewis said.
The student suffered a cut under his left eye that required five stitches, and his face was swollen, Lewis said. He also sprained his left wrist.
At roughly 11:30 p.m. Wednesday, a local man was shot in a drive-by shooting in front of the fence on Exposition across from “A” building at Parkside Apartments.
The man was wounded in the leg, and about 10 shots were fired, according to eyewitnesses at Parkside.
Security responded immediately and stabilized the man’s condition with first aid, Ritch said.
“We waited 40 minutes for an ambulance, but no one came,” he said. “So we commandeered the Escort van, moved the seats, and took him to California Hospital in the van.”
Neither Ritch nor Lewis knew the man’s condition Sunday.
On Thursday at 10:25 p.m., two male students were attacked by looters at 36th Place and Vermont Avenue as they tried to collect their parked car. Security officers saw the looters jump the students and responded in force.
“They were rescued by security,” Lewis said. “We stabilized the situation, and the students took off in their car.”
One student was bleeding from the mouth, Lewis said, but he did not know of any other injuries.
At 11:15 a.m. the same day, a female student was pulled from her car in front of her carport at 1226 30th Place, Lewis said.
The student was shaken up, but unharmed, and the suspect drove off with her car west on 30th and then turned north on Vermont. The car has not been recovered.
On Friday at 9:15 p.m., three male students were pulled out of their car by National Guard troops in front of the Burger King next to Fire station 15 on Jefferson, Lewis said.
Apparently, the students had driven by the station two to three times very slowly, then parked their car in front of the Burger King and turned their lights off.
National Guard troops surrounded the car and forced the students to sit on the curb with their hands on their heads at gunpoint. Security arrived and searched the car, Lewis said.
“They found a large ‘Rambo’ knife in the front seat,” Lewis said. “In the trunk were three handguns in holsters — a .22 semi-automatic, and .22 revolver and a .38 revolver.”
“The students were apparently ‘videotaping the unrest,’” Lewis said. “The weapons were booked at Southwest Division.” The students received a reprimand for breaking the curfew.
Four students were also arrested for looting, Ritch said, but only one was booked.
A robbery at 11 a.m. at 1186 W. 27th St. caused $5,000 worth of property damage Saturday, Lewis said.
Rumors abound about other campus disturbances.
Two students were allegedly beaten up in the Century Apartments parking lot, but security could not confirm the reports. The Office of Residential and Greek Life had heard the rumor, but also could not confirm the beatings.
Some students were also taking matters into their own hands.
Armed students were stopped by security while patrolling Troyland Apartments on Thursday.
Fraternity members said they stayed around to protect their house and the Row throughout the rioting.
The members were armed with a variety of guns, from shotguns to 9mm Beretta pistols.
“All my stuff is here,” a fraternity member said. “We have veterans of Desert Storm in our house, and we’re letting them handle it. All the houses on the Row have guns.”
“We almost got involved in a drive-by when a car drove up and they saw my pistol sticking out of my pants,” he added.
“The car drove by, stopped, and they saw my gun where my shirt had come up and then they threw the car into reverse. Guns came out the windows and we drove behind the planter. They yelled at us and drove off,” he said.
Ritch said that he couldn’t blame fraternity members for being armed, but said that the penalties would be severe if the members were caught with weapons. He had not heard of any incidents on the Row.
Other incidents included damage to cars parked around the campus and several arrests of suspects in parking structures and on campus. But Lewis was amazed at the lack of significant injuries and damage.
“We owe a lot to the high presence of our people,” he said.
“Anyone came on campus, we put the jam on them,” Lewis said.
 
Assistant City Editor Julie Yamamoto contributed to this report.
There was a map that went along with this article that showed the businesses adjacent to the campus that had been burned or looted. Can you re-publish that map? I remember it was very interesting and telling of the experience.
Thanks!

A group of Chinese physicians will travel to USC for training in minimally invasive surgery, as part of a new educational and research agreement formalized by the Keck School of Medicine last year.
Summer · Around 75 physicians in groups of four from China will attend a two to three week-training session at the Keck Medical School of USC. Participants will observe and learn techniques for minimally invasive surgery. - Photo courtesy of Keck School of Medicine of USC
The university will offer a structured training program that will allow Chinese physicians to come to the Health Sciences Campus in groups of four to spend two or three weeks observing complex, minimally invasive surgery in operating rooms at the Keck Hospital of USC. The program will also provide physicians with online training and education, a skills lab and mentoring by USC faculty.
The agreement provides for as many as 75 surgeons to come to USC each year and for research collaboration and faculty exchanges. Keck will also use telemedicine to offer second opinions to physicians and patients throughout China.
Brad Selby, chief administrative officer of the Department of Surgery at Keck, said the agreement is a significant initiative for  the university and California.
“It’s also an important project for California because the Pacific Rim is vitally important to the university as a whole,” Selby said. “There’s a huge Chinese population here in Southern California.”
Selby said it is important to form partnerships with China because of the presence of Chinese-Americans in California.
“There were a lot of compelling reasons for us [to enter into an agreement with China], especially future opportunities, research collaboration and patient care. There’s a huge Chinese population here in Southern California,” Selby said.
The program is funded by the participants’ universities.

When Clayton Dube, executive director of the USC US-China Institute, took his first trip to China in 1982, he expected to spend a month backpacking around the country before returning home to California. Instead, he got a job and stayed for three years.
Support · Clayton Dube, executive director of the USC US-China Institute, spoke at the vigil for graduate students Ying Wu and Ming Qu. - Carlo Acenas | Daily Trojan
“When I went to China in 1982, I had not really studied China very much,” Dube said. “Upon going to China, I found myself completely fascinated by the country, by the culture, by the people and wanted to know more.”
He spent two years teaching English and American studies at the Central Institute of Financial Banking and a third year at the Beijing Broadcasting Institute.
“When I came back to the United States in 1985, I thought I was mostly done with China, but I wasn’t,” Dube said. “The lure remained strong.”
Dube had finished his undergraduate degree when he traveled to China but decided to return to school to study Chinese history, with an emphasis in modern economics. He taught at Berea College in Kentucky before going to UCLA, where he began the work that would eventually lead him to his position as executive director of the USC US-China Institute.
“UCLA and USC cooperate on almost nothing, but we absolutely have a long history of cooperating on East Asia,” Dube said. “We have a joint East Asia center. I managed the UCLA side of that so, as a consequence, I had close ties with people here and was always impressed that USC had a lot of strength on contemporary China.”
He said he was offered the job when the institute opened in 2002, aiming to examine US-China relations from a wide variety of angles, to train students to study these relations and to enhance and improve inter-country relations. Dube also oversees production of US-China Today, Asian Pacific Arts and a variety of programs that take students and teachers to tour China.
“Last year, about 11 programs took USC students to China and exposed them to different things,” Dube said. “Their lives will be richer for the experience. China has a rich history and distinctive culture, and in understanding something about someone else, you really come to understand yourself more. You’ll find out what you truly care about, what you value, what really matters to you.”
Two weeks ago, Dube and the institute stepped in to assist the university after the fatal shootings of Chinese graduate students Ying Wu and Ming Qu on April 11. Dube said they worked with the Office of Student Affairs, the Office for International Services and the community to notify their parents, organize the memorial service and facilitate conversation between the students’ parents and Viterbi School of Engineering faculty and students.
“This took a little bit of all of us, and it’s by coming together that we nourish each other and help each other through this,” he said. “We did all and are still doing all that we can, but that’s not just true here, that’s true across the campus.”
Dube also spoke in Chinese at the candlelight vigil the night of the shooting.
“So many people came together with no notice,” he said. “I just tried to share what was in my heart.”

The Marshall School of Business will hold a ceremony May 11 following commencement for a select group of students taking the Master of Business Administration Oath, a voluntary pledge through which graduates commit to “creating value responsibly and ethically.”
The MBA Oath is a national movement that originated with Harvard Business School’s class of 2009. The MBA Oath at USC is being planned by the Marshall Honor Committee.
Diane Badame, assistant dean for the Marshall MBA Program, said the oath demonstrates Marshall’s commitment to honesty and integrity.
“We want to reinforce these values in our students and expose them to the kinds of values we think they should have as they leave our institution,” Badame said.
Anne Ziemniak, the MBA program manager responsible for the Marshall Honor Committee, said students and faculty brought the oath to Marshall to reaffirm their commitment to conducting themselves and their businesses ethically.
Ziemniak said the MBA Oath initiative was a response to the unethical practices of Wall Street executives.
“With recent issues, MBAs have been blamed for past unethical proceedings,” Ziemniak said. “We’re taking a stand because students don’t want to be associated with that reputation.”
Marshall’s adoption of the MBA Oath complements the goals of the Marshall Honor Committee, which requires students in the full-time MBA program to sign the Code of Professional and Academic Integrity upon enrolling, Ziemniak said. This honor code lays expectations for student behavior regarding the community, the curriculum and their careers.
The Marshall Honor Committee hopes to encourage more than 50 students, approximately a quarter of the graduating class, to take the oath next year.
Students will have to attend two lectures each semester to meet the requirements of the oath.
Though the Marshall MBA program does not offer courses specifically pertaining to ethics, the voluntary pledge symbolizes Marshall’s effort to create a culture dedicated to the betterment of society, Ziemniak said.
“We are trying to foster a culture that weaves ethics throughout all of our programs and initiatives,” Ziemniak said. “If students are armed with prior knowledge about ethics before getting in sticky situations, this program will make a huge impact.”
Oh yeah, I’m sure this meaningless ceremony is going to be “life changing.”
It’s like asking a dishwasher to promise to wash his hands after going to the bathroom…
An oath isn’t going to do jack squat.
Whether these Marshall students prove ethical in their future careers relies on how well their professors taught them about the consequences of unethical business practices.
How stupid!

In five years, most baby boomers will have retired, leaving many job vacancies for recent graduates and young people in California, according to a report released Tuesday.
The ratio of seniors older than 65 years to working-age Californians will increase from about 20 seniors per 100 working-age Californians to 28 seniors in 2020 and 36 seniors in 2030, according to the report “Generational Projections of the California Population by Nativity and Year of Immigrant Arrival.”
“We all hear about the problems of today,” said Dowell Myers, co-author of the report and a USC professor of urban planning and demography. “It’s a tough, tough job market, and people just can’t imagine how it can turn around, but within five years, it turns around big time and actually goes in the opposite direction. … We will have a shortage of workers.”
In the past 20 years, California’s population of working-age people — ages 25 to 64 — grew by 4.2 million people. In the next 20 years, however, the population is expected to slow its growth and increase by 3.3 million, according to the report, also authored by senior research associate John Pitkin in the Population Dynamics Research Group.
“We’re facing this enormous change in the next 20 years,” Myers said. “The baby boomer generation is retiring right now. … There will be more job openings, there will be easier promotions, there will be more homes people are trying to sell and [young people] will be the buyers.”
Shoshana Polansky, a senior majoring in sociology, said she believes more jobs will become available, but the transition will take time.
“I don’t see baby boomers retiring in five years, but the thoughts behind it make sense,” said Polansky, who is currently applying for full-time jobs. “‘There’s no jobs’ is what everyone was saying, and I think that it’s more like, ‘Are there jobs that you’re qualified for?’”
As the population becomes top heavy with retirees, California’s overall population will see dramatically less growth than the state previously projected. The California Department of Finance showed the state reaching a population of 50 million people by 2032, yet the report found that California’s population will reach 50 million more than a decade later in 2046.
The report found a different projection because the demographers of the report used the most recent 2010 census data in its estimations and closely considered California’s immigrant population, said Myers, who found the California population was 1.8 million lower than the state had projected.
“[California was] way off because they were over expecting how much migration would be coming into California,” Myers said.
Immigration, particularly from Mexico, has decreased and will continue to decrease, Myers said. California’s population of children — 18 years old and below — will also decrease and nearly halt growth. Between 1990 and 2010, the child population grew by 1.6 million, whereas by 2030, the child population will decrease by 4.2 percentage points.
“In general, there will be fewer people trying to go to college because there are fewer kids, except that’s bad for society.” Myers said. “We need to have more college graduates, not fewer.”
With fewer children in California’s future, educating youth should be the state’s priority, Myers said.
“With young people better educated, you get better taxpayers … if you have better taxpayers, that takes care of all the problems,” Myers said.
Polansky said higher education is essential in securing the future.
“Losing sight of funding for higher education is going to be one of the poorest choices that we can make for our economy in the future,” Polansky said. “I’m hopeful that if companies and the government and voters alike refocus their attention on the importance of an educated workforce, then I’m confident that there will be plenty more jobs than there are today.”

A sharp intake of breath at the start of a measure, the soft brush as a bow hits the strings –— these intimate details happen countless times during any orchestra performance, but they are often overlooked because of the distance that typically exists between the audience and the stage.
Hello cello · Timothy Landauer (above) performs at a concert put on by Le Salon de Musiques. The music company strives to create a more up-close and personal experience for the audience. - Photo courtesy of Henry Lim
Enter Le Salon de Musiques, an innovative chamber music series that brings much-needed intimacy to the musical experience. Held on the third Sunday of every month at the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion in the Performing Arts Center of Los Angeles County, the series features internationally renowned chamber musicians who perform in close proximity to the audience, creating a completely one-of-a-kind viewing experience.
Le Salon de Musiques founder and director François Chouchan, a distinguished French pianist who studied at the Conservatoire National Supérieur de Musique de Paris and performs in the concert series himself, drew inspiration from Marie Antoinette’s own Salon de Musiques. The Salon was an intimate place erected at the queen’s Petit Trianon domain in Versailles in the late 18th century.
“I always wanted to create a concert series which could be more intimate and closer to the people,” Chouchan said. “It’s really important to feel the instruments and to feel the vibrations of the instruments themselves.”
In this day and age, where YouTube stars and mainstream music reign supreme, people often stereotype classical music as too bourgeois. To combat this and create accessibility, the Salon series fosters communication between the musicians and the audience. Each performance features an introduction to the piece’s period and composer, and the audience directly interacts with the musicians to discuss their ideas, impressions and thoughts on the music after the performance.
By promoting an intimate yet educational viewing experience, the Salon series makes chamber music accessible for anyone to enjoy.
“To be close to the artists and instruments themselves — it will help people discover music differently,” Chouchan said. “I wanted people to be able to meet the musicians after the performance to talk, to exchange their feeling and emotions.”
The Salon series’ programming is a classical music lover’s dream, featuring beloved works from the masters, such as Mozart, Schumann and Brahms, while also highlighting lesser-known composers like Arensky. For guests  experiencing chamber music for the first time, the program features pieces that holistically demonstrate different chamber music instruments and styles.
“I want people to discover different spaces of chamber music,” Chouchan said. “This can be strings, piano and strings, winds and strings — the chamber music repertoire is so wide. I also wanted to feature a big diversity of beautiful, big season composers and choose melodic pieces which can touch people.”
Concert 7 of the Salon de Musiques series, which took place April 22 and featured works by classical Russian composers Arensky and Tchaikovsky, was a complete revelation for the eyes and ears and truly epitomized the Salon’s vision.
At the start of the program, the audience was told the context behind Arensky’s “Variations on a Theme by Tchaikovsky, Op. 35” and Tchaikovsky’s “Souvenir de Florence.” The musicians performing included violinists Phillip Levy and Julie Gigante, violists Andrew Duckles and Alma Fernandez and cellists Timothy Landauer and David Low.
From the first measure of Arensky’s variations, the richness and immediacy of the instruments instantly hit the audience. The ethereal, thin sound of Arensky’s work was exemplified by the quartet and enhanced by the use of two cellos rather than one. The four musicians moved swiftly and elegantly in unison between Arensky’s lighter, brighter variations to the deeper, moodier variations.
Following the Arensky piece, violinist Gigante and violist Fernandez joined in on Tchaikovsky’s “Souvenir de Florence,” a robust, lively masterpiece from the Russian composer that features a full sextet of two violins, two violas and two cellos.
The true intimacy of the performance setup creates a joyful musical experience that cannot be overemphasized. The musicians’ overall tone quality is also amazing — long bow strokes fill the room with rich, warm sounds and crisp, pure pizzicati resonate sharply off the walls. Being so close to the performers also allows the audience to hone in on each recurring theme and melody, which each musician expertly picks up from the other performers.
In the conversation that followed the performance, one woman commented that the Tchaikovsky made her feel like she was in Florence again. Another guest asked the musicians how they felt playing with one another, to which violinist Fernandez replied that they feel love and support within the group. Other topics of discussion included the musicians’ perspective on playing so close to the audience, how they maintained their concentration while playing and even the role of music in their own families.
Though only one more performance looms ahead in this season’s series, the future holds intriguing developments. Next season, the Salon will feature works by Russian, German and French composers, some which have never even be printed or shared with an audience before.
Promises Chouchan: “It will be the crème de la crème.”
The Salon de Musiques series can be defined by the word revelation — for newcomers to chamber music, it’s an eye-opening introduction to the classical realm and for classical music regulars, it’s a realization that nothing compares to the exhilarating experience of watching musical masterpieces performed up close.

It’s a strange time for comics. It’s a strange time for media. Newspapers and books are struggling with the digital market, while films and music are fighting piracy. It’s not that simple to say the Internet is killing traditional media; new forms of distribution and a rise of independent creators are forcing pillars of any medium to adapt, but the end to which they are adapting is unclear.
Comic books rose in popularity from the 1940s to 1970s — a time known as the Golden Age and Silver Age of Comics. The industry soon  declined, barring the speculator sales boom in the early 1990s that ended up bursting and nearly killing Marvel Comics.
Comics have recovered since then, with a creative renaissance, a new wave of talent and graphic novel sections in major bookstores introducing a wider audience to the medium. But the industry was disrupted as comics began to go beyond the printed page.
So yes, comics are in trouble. Sales are declining and distribution centers are at risk of shutting down. But is the entire industry in danger of collapsing? No, not at all. It’s hard to imagine the destruction of an entire medium. But many publishers could go under, and the market could shrink.
A few years ago, as movies based on comic books took off and popular creators sold the movie rights to their series before the first issues came out, it appeared that comics might become nothing more than the new form of a spec script for Hollywood. But that did not do much to help comics themselves; not every creator or title can swing a movie deal.
So if movies aren’t the end-all, be-all destinations for the comic book world, what is the future of the industry?
The answer is — no surprise here — reinventing the comic. This doesn’t mean throwing out the old or simply retreating back to the storytelling and distribution styles of 1940. Instead, creators and publishers, whether consciously or not, are breaking out of accumulated habits and experimenting more with the medium.
After all, what is a comic but a narrative told through images and text?
It’s not limited to superheroes in tights, sarcastic cats and their owners, noir crime stories or autobiographies. Any kind of story can be told with images and text; more importantly, the combination is practically a blank slate for other elements.
Comics are pricey. An average 22-page comic costs $3. Depending on the extra story elements or additional features, some can cost  more than $4. When so many series are story arcs drawn out over multiple issues to pad out the eventual collected edition, it is easy to feel cheated as a consumer.
So there has been a recent effort to give each issue something more. Writers are refocusing on putting more story per page. Grant Morrison’s continuing series Batman Incorporated is a compressed, dense title with each issue featuring dozens of continuity shoutouts, plot twists and new ideas. Each installment is unique and its own story; nothing feels like a random excerpt of a chapter.
Meanwhile, series such as Rex Mundi and LOCAL threw in supplementary material in the back of an issue, ranging from world-building articles to accompanying soundtracks.
But other creators are also trying to use the digital market to help their comics. Comics have been known for captions featuring notes from the editors explaining a shoutout or for infamous sound effects such as “blam.”
Yet with the digital market, people are creating comics that embrace transmedia and add sound and bonus features. Operation Ajax, for instance, offers archival video footage and historical documents as pop-ups in its story of the 1953 coup in Iran.
It’s still a story told via art and text, but these extra elements add a new aspect to the reading experience that shows how the digital realm can be more than just uploaded comic book pages.
Comics are facing a rough time. It’s a strangely paradoxical moment in which comic properties are extremely popular throughout the world, but their titles are not drawing in new readers.
Creators are, however, working to give readers that extra incentive to pick up a comic book by playing with new ways to tell a story. And that’s why people read comics: for exciting and engaging stories. If creators can bring that back, comics have a bright future ahead of them.

Superhero movies are nothing new. Adventures of Captain Marvel debuted 71 years ago as a film serial, followed soon after by serials starring Batman, The Phantom and other heroes. But more often than not, the superhero genre has been dismissed, with films often playing for camp and laughs, as with Batman and Robin.

In the last 12 years, however, the genre has been reborn with bigger budgets, more dedication and a greater scope. And of the superhero films coming out this year, The Avengers aims to do something no other film has done: bring together heroes from established, successful films and put them in one movie designed to top them all.
The Avengers debuted in print in 1963, uniting the biggest heroes of the newly successful Marvel Comics brand. The team differentiated itself from DC’s Justice League by depicting its heroes butting heads and clashing over their course of action.
The film version has been in the works for more than four years, with the groundwork being set by Samuel L. Jackson’s cameo as Nick Fury at the end of the first Iron Man movie. It’s taken four more films to build to Buffy the Vampire Slayer and Firefly-creator Joss Whedon’s most-antipated film yet. But even with a great cast of characters and Whedon serving as writer and director, it was still a difficult task to put the movie together.
“One of the only fears I had was the whole thing would collapse under its own weight,” said Kevin Feige, the producer behind many of Marvel’s films.
His fear made sense: The Avengers tries to thematically intertwine films grounded in science, Norse mythology and war, on top of a cast of wildly different heroes. It worked on the comic-book page, but ran the risk of being too over the top and disconnected on the big screen.
Thankfully, Whedon manages to tie the film around what made the original comic so unique: the character drama.
“Joss said it early on: [It’s] a dysfunctional family,” said Chris Hemsworth, who plays Thor. “We somehow belong among the fact we don’t belong anywhere else.”
Jackson, who plays the authority figure and superspy Nick Fury, added that the family dynamic helps keep the film grounded.
“The family feeling was there. Joss set up the rules and we showed up and played by the rules of that world,” he said. “OK, these guys have superpowers, but they all have normal kinds of attitudes.”
Whedon also worked to strike the right balance between introducing the subject to newer fans and progressing the storyline, all while making it feel natural to viewers.
“I have to know how much people need to know,” Whedon said. “You don’t necessarily have to lay everything out, but organizing that is, and was, the most exhausting part of the film. Writing the stuff between the characters? That’s just candy. That’s just booze and candy all day.”
There’s a saying that a hero is only as good as his villain, and when it’s seven heroes against one, that villain needs to be epic. That’s part of what makes Tom Hiddleston’s performance as classic supervillain Loki — Thor’s arch-nemesis — so excellent. He stole the show once already in Thor and manages to not only keep up with every member of the Avengers on screen, but to also add a fascinating hint of insanity to his entire performance, from line delivery to body language.
“I never get afraid of things, only excited. It’s just so much fun,” Hiddleston said. “[Loki’s] just such a great character. Nevermind the iconography. It’s like playing an iconic Shakespearean character. When I read it, I couldn’t believe my luck.”
More than anything, The Avengers is an action film, and it shows off spectacle. Almost by nature, the film had to be bigger in every way than its predecessors; thankfully, the third act thrills and fits more action and a grander sense of scope into the film than ever before.
“The most important thing was that it not be a spectacle for its own sake — that it be earned and understandable,” Whedon said. “I tend to be very pedantic about that. I don’t want a blur of things crashing around. I had to just give myself up and realize that every time a car is hit by anything, it blows up and flips over. A hamster could hit it, and boom!”
The Avengers drips with ambition — and lives up to it too. Is it the greatest superhero film ever made? Maybe not. Still, there’s something about Whedon’s storytelling skills — and the interplay between the actors — that overcomes any narrative holes or flaws. It’s a film that manages to show superheroes at their finest and, in the process, offers a stunningly fun time.

E-40
Thursday, April 26, at 9 p.m.
Key Club Hollywood
Seminal Bay Area rapper E-40 should be more than just the butt of jokes about how to “get stupid” and “ghostride the whip.” The prolific musician and entrepreneur has released 17 albums and earned critical acclaim for his signature flow. Perhaps it’s illustrative of E-40’s work ethic that his three most recent full-length efforts — the first, second and third volumes of The Block Brochure: Welcome to the Soil — dropped within the same year, 2012, and on the same day.
E-40’s trek down south for a show at Hollywood’s Key Club promises a great show. He’s joined by an assortment of guests, including contemporaries Young Lawless and Block Balling, who promise to keep the show unpredictably entertaining.
 
Cedar Lake Contemporary Ballet
Friday, April 27, at 8 p.m.
UCLA Royce Hall
Move over, Billy Elliot: There’s a new ballet production in town.
This Friday, the Cedar Lake Contemporary Ballet company will perform three productions: Simply Marvel, Grace Engine and Hubbub.
Regina van Berkel’s Simply Marvel kicks off the show with energy and chaos and is set to music by Paganini and Theo Verbey.
Famed choreographer Crystal Pite’s piece follows suit. Her West Coast debut of Grace Engine uses dance as a narrative tool to tell stories that unite mankind; the choreography strives to emulate elements of cinematic editing, such as montage and flashbacks, to convey the interwoven stories.
Alexander Ekman’s Hubbub concludes the night on a comical note. His story of participation and criticism looks at the performance rituals of a group of people, while a commentator offers potential meanings for the work.

It’s time to put on your dancing shoes, or at the very least, watch others do so.
 
Create:Fixate’s Snap Flash 2012
Saturday, April 28, 7 p.m.-2 a.m.
Premiere Events Center
With photography so accessible these days — take a snapshot with your iPhone, throw it up on Instagram, repeat — it’s easy to forget the wondrous possibilities the medium really offers when put in the hands of an artist with a vision.
Snap Flash 2012 is L.A. art organization Create:Fixate’s “all-photography” show, in which anything goes as long as it’s good. And there’s a lot to see: For only $15 before 9 p.m., and $20 after, you get access to the show’s Optical Lounge and Audio Lab, both of which offer innovative, entertaining installations and performances.
The Optical Lounge offers work from a multitude of media, including digital, film, 3-D and even interactive pieces. The Audio Lab, on the other hand, is a place to enjoy live music, with everything from electronica to jazz slated for the show. The two experiences undoubtedly add up to an intriguing night out.
 
I’m Going Somewhere With This: Coachella Stories
Sunday, April 29, at 8 p.m.
The Mint
Unfortunately, this year’s sprawling, three-day extravaganza of incredible music, hideous porta-potties and mild drug abuse known as the Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival has come and gone.
Though Tupac’s ghost — or was it just a stage illusion? — may be rapping no more, that doesn’t mean the festival won’t live on. As anyone who’s gone to Coachella knows firsthand, the experience makes for a bevy of often-hilarious, sometimes-disgusting and always-entertaining stories. How much funnier would it be, however, if the stories were told by stand-up comics instead of your stoned roommate?
That’s the question that stands to be answered in this month’s installment of I’m Going Somewhere With This, local comedian Josh di Donato’s storytelling series. He won’t be alone on stage, either — previous surprise guests have included comics like Margaret Cho and Laura Kightlinger. And with tickets selling for only $8, this night of laughter is a steal.

After dominating the non conference portion of the schedule, USC baseball has struggled to maintain the same level of play against Pac-12 opponents.
The Trojans will have to reverse that trend if the team hopes to play in the NCAA tournament, starting with a key home weekend series against Oregon State.

The series will be another huge test for USC, a team that started the year 7-0, its best beginning since 1988. After winning 19 of the team’s first 29 games, however, the Trojans have had problems staying at the top of their game.
Oregon State, meanwhile, has had no such issues of late. The Beavers have won eight out of their last nine, including an impressive series victory over national titan UCLA.
The Beavers also excel away from home, coming into Dedeaux Field with a record of 15-7 in away games. That statistic would seem to neutralize the home-field advantage that USC has enjoyed in 2012 (14-6 at Dedeaux).
Despite recent struggles, the Trojans aren’t exactly overmatched heading into the three-game set with Oregon State. USC has proven it can hang with the big dogs when presented with the opportunity, as evidenced by tight three-game sets with powerhouses Stanford and North Carolina.
Another reason for the Trojans to be confident is the performance of their starters at each end of the weekend rotation. Senior Andrew Triggs, set to go in the series opener Friday night, comes into the weekend with a 3.19 ERA and a strikeout-to-walk ratio better than 4-1.
Meanwhile, freshman Stephen Tarpley has suffered one loss all year and is coming off four hitless innings against Long Beach State  from Tuesday night.
But the Beavers have the offense to contend with USC’s starting pitching. Freshman standout Michael Conforto has eight home runs to go along with 52 RBI, marks that lead the team in their respective categories.
Throw in speedster infielder Tyler Smith, who enters the series with a .406 batting average, and Oregon State’s attack has the potential to be the best USC will see all year.
Friday’s game will start at 6 p.m., with Saturday’s and Sunday’s games beginning at 2 p.m. and 11 a.m., respectively.

Until we meet again, USC.
Wednesday marked the last night of production of The Daily Trojan for the spring semester, which means the semester is coming to a close. We all know what that means for students:
Finals.
Summer vacation.
Job-hunting.
But for many USC students, alumni and fans, the end of the semester means something else: no more Trojan athletics until football season begins.
The thought of it scares some, including myself.
No Disco Dave.
No Tommy Trojan or Traveler.
No bacon-wrapped hot dogs on Exposition Blvd.
No one representing the Cardinal and Gold.
But the summer can be saved.
There are plenty of USC athletes to watch as the school year comes to a close. The top-ranked men’s volleyball team is still fighting for a national championship and will likely be battling for the next couple of weeks. If coach Frank Cruz and the Trojan baseball team can get the bats swinging once again, a trip to the postseason is not out of the realm of possibility for them, either.
The three-time defending champion men’s tennis team and the highly ranked women’s tennis team have the opportunity to play their way into late May if the tennis balls bounce the right way. The golf teams will have a chance to swing their clubs into June. The list goes on.
But that being said, Trojan athletics will come to an end sometime in June, right?
Wrong.
We have the 2012 London Olympics to look forward to. Though usually thought of as a country-against-country battle, spread among the participating nations are Trojans from around the world looking to bring pride to not only their homelands, but also to their alma mater as well.
If USC was a country, it would have the 12th-most medals in the world. This year could raise that statistic drastically.
Sophomore goalkeeper Flora Bolonyai from the women’s water polo team will compete for her home country Hungary, which is one of eight teams to make it to the Olympics in this category. Senior utility Sofia Konoukh will be playing for her home country of Russia. Sophomore swimmer Vladimir Morozov will take to the pool for his native Russia.
Alumna track star Zsofia Erdelyi will likely be running for Hungary as well, as will alumnus Jesse Williams, who is currently the world champion in the high jump and will likely compete for team USA. Corey White, who lettered at USC in 2008 and 2009, will likely participate in the javelin throw, as he was ranked second in the United States last year.
Senior Joey Hughes (400-meter), junior Reggie Wyatt (400-meter hurdles) and senior Bryshon Nellum (400-meter) will all have a chance to compete on the world’s highest stage for the United States.
Former women’s soccer star Amy Rodriguez has already locked up a spot on the United States’ team. Rebecca Soni, who is an assistant on swim coach Dave Salo’s staff, will likely be swimming for the U.S. in the breaststroke, as she won the 2011 World Championships.
Speaking of Salo, he will be on the Olympic staff, too.
Sophomore sprinter Jessica Davis will potentially make the trip to London, as will senior sprinter Aareon Payne and sophomore hurdler Lauren Blackburn.
Four-time NCAA champion water polo player Joel Dennerley, who recently graduated will likely make the Australian national team as the goalkeeper. Senior swimmer Katinka Hosszu, who participated in 2008 in Beijing, will likely be in the water for Hungary.
And the list goes on.
USC athletics might be on a temporary hiatus for the summer, but the athletes who have made their mark on campus will be on the world’s biggest stage come July 27 when the games begin. No, not all these Trojans will make the games. We will not officially know all of the Olympians until mid-July. But the fact that so many Trojans are in contention is astounding.
The Olympics are reserved for the best athletes in the world. There is no questioning that. And without a doubt, USC churns out some of the best athletes in the world. Though many of these athletes go unnoticed because they do not play in high-revenue sports, come July, they will get their due. We don’t see them on ABC or ESPN every Saturday, but the world will soon be watching.
So if you think that there isn’t anything to look forward to until summer practice begins for senior quarterback Matt Barkley and the rest of the football team, you are mistaken.
USC’s best will be on the other side of the world, hoping to make their countries proud. As Trojans, we have a responsibility to root for them, cheer them on and recognize how incredibly difficult it is to be among the best in the world. Trojans everywhere deserve to be proud.
This summer is the best time to be a USC fan. It’s where the greatest action happens. Those passes that Barkley throws on Howard Jones Field starting in early August are just the icing on the Cardinal and Gold cake.

The regular season has come and gone and with the postseason ahead, the USC men’s tennis team’s quest for a fourth consecutive NCAA championship begins now.
Following their first loss in 14 months, the No. 1 Trojans (25-1, 6-1) look to rebound and begin a new streak at the Pac-12 tournament in Ojai, Calif.

The 3-4 loss to No. 5 UCLA (21-2, 7-0) at Marks Stadium last Friday snapped the Trojans’ 45-match win streak that dated back to February, 2011.
By finishing conference play undefeated, UCLA is slotted at the No. 1 seed in the tournament, while USC will be the No. 2 seed and will begin play in the semifinals Saturday at 3 p.m.
USC will likely play No. 10 Stanford (16-7, 5-2) in the semifinals. The Cardinal have one bye and will play either No. 70 Oregon or Utah in the quarterfinals.
The Trojans have swept Stanford twice this season, with the first 7-0 victory at Stanford in February and the latter at Marks Stadium on April 14.
“They’re going to want revenge,” senior Daniel Nguyen said. “They’re going to be a tough team and mix up their lineup a bit.”
Though the Trojans relish the chance of a rematch with the Bruins in the finals Saturday, they are careful not to look past the semifinal matchup.
“We better be careful with that. [Stanford is] a proud program,” USC coach Peter Smith said. “They’re certainly going to be swinging from the hip with nothing to lose.”
The last team standing will be crowned the Pac-12 champion and automatically qualify for the NCAA championships in Athens, Ga., in May.
The tournament will feature a dual-match team format for the first time in conference history. Before this year, the tournament consisted of 32 players and 16 pairs vying for individual singles and doubles titles.
“I was a big proponent of [the team format]. I’ve been pushing for it for about five years. I want to make Ojai relevant again,” Smith said. “I don’t know how we’ll do but we’re fired up.”
Last year, No. 2 senior Steve Johnson advanced through five rounds of singles play and emerged as the 2011 Pac-10 singles champion.
Johnson and No. 25 sophomore Ray Sarmiento also took home the doubles crown after four rounds of play.
With the new team format, the Trojans will look for consistency from their individual talent, which includes five ranked players in singles.
Alongside Johnson and Sarmiento, Nguyen is ranked No. 17 in the nation, while freshman Yannick Hanfmann and sophomore Emilio Gomez stand at No. 43 and No. 50, respectively.
In doubles, USC will feature the No. 3 pair in Johnson and freshman Roberto Quiroz and the No. 25 pair in Nguyen and Sarmiento.
Though USC’s streak has come to an end, Johnson is still in a groove with 58 consecutive singles wins and 12 straight in doubles with Quiroz.
Despite missing the opportunity to finish the regular season undefeated, Smith believes the loss to their crosstown rivals will remind the Trojans of the joy of victory and be essential to their journey for postseason glory.

No. 1 USC is primed to take on No. 2 UC Irvine in the Mountain Pacific Sports Federation semifinal match at 7:30 at the Galen Center Thursday.
The Trojans (23-4, 18-4) have won 18 straight matches. Coming off a sweep over No. 11 Cal State Northridge, after playing the Matadors late in the regular season only a week earlier, the Trojans are peaking at the right time.

“We were able to adjust on troubles we had the week previous,” USC coach Bill Ferguson said. “We were far more efficient. With that short prep time, it’s really a question about who is going to improve more during the time in between matches.”
Despite the winning streak and the many years of close-but-not-quite-there, the Trojans are not succumbing to the pressure of years past.
“There’s no need to jump and yell,” Ferguson said. “They just get it. Nothing we have to hammer home — they just understand what it takes to win.”
The Anteaters (22-5, 17-5) are tied for the second spot in the conference along with Stanford and BYU. The Trojans beat the Anteaters during the first week of the month in four sets.
In that match, the Trojans disarmed the characteristically strong UC Irvine serving attack with a strong outside hitting attack as an adjustment to ball control issues. The Trojans also held the Anteaters to .206 hitting.
The Trojan defense has been a juggernaut this year, holding opponents to a conference-best .179 hitting percentage. Though the Trojans are not the offensive juggernaut of years past with a modest .300 percentage (fifth in the conference) their ability to shut down opposing offenses has made them competitive.
“The trio of Micah [Christenson], Maddison [McKibbin] and Tanner [Jansen] can be absolutely shut-down blockers,” Ferguson said. “With 60 percent of the action in volleyball going right at them, that means a lot of points.”
The Trojans have come from being a young team maligned with injury to a healthy force to be reckoned with. Featuring MPSF Player of the Year senior outside hitter Tony Ciarelli, second-teamer senior middle blocker Steven Shandrick and honorable mention team members sophomore libero Henry Cassiday, freshman middle blocker Robert Feathers and sophomore opposite Tanner Jansen, the Trojan lineup is deep and effective.
Ciarelli is the second Trojan in a row to win MPSF Player of the Year, following Murphy Troy in 2011.
“It’s an honor, but it doesn’t really change anything,” Ciarelli said. “People get these awards because they work hard in practice. This award won’t change my approach or how hard I play.”
Ferguson credits strength and conditioning coach Brent Metz, who he touts as “the best in the sport” for the team’s physical health after a long and grueling season. The program’s approach toward in-season improvement, rather than maintenance or injury prevention, has the team’s aggregate vertical jump seeing increases rather than typical decreases because of wear and tear.
“We keep getting better,” Ferguson said. “Our guys are focused and their heads are in the right place.”

Students and administrators have been racking their brains for a solution to the bicycle congestion on campus.
But a new bike policy isn’t going to change reality: There are simply too many bikes at USC.
Irene Wang | Daily Trojan
The concept of reducing bike traffic by reducing the actual number of bikes has been mysteriously absent from the congestion conversation. Nevertheless, it is a strategy with tremendous potential for success. Instead of trying to make our dense campus bike-friendly, USC should think more realistically and advocate alternative forms of transportation. Students who currently bike should seriously think about making the switch.
Last week, the Office of Student Affairs and the USC Bicycle Master Plan consultant team outlined several proposed solutions to the congestion problem, including designated bike lanes on campus.
Bike lanes will accomplish one of the university’s major goals regarding bikes, which is safety.
Unfortunately, this solution won’t make biking any more convenient. Bike lanes would not reduce congestion so much as redirect it. While non-bikers would enjoy open expanses of path and roadway, bikers would be confined to specific areas on campus.
Bikes would no longer be able to zip around someone who happens to be peddling as fast as they can walk. They would no longer be able to take favorite shortcuts or make a quick U-turn when they decide to stop for a bite at Seeds Marketplace at the last minute.
Many other bike-related inconveniences would be significantly reduced if fewer people chose to bike in the first place. The most obvious inconvenience is the severe shortage of places to park a bike, let alone to lock it. The Bicycle Master Plan does include plans to add more storage space for bikes, but our tight urban campus only has room for so much.
The lack of adequate storage for bicycles contributes to the other big problem for bike owners: theft. Equally irritating is when you can’t tell if your bike has been stolen because it’s just as likely that it has been consumed by the labyrinth of bikes outside Leavey Library.
Longboarders and scooter riders experience none of these issues. They enjoy the ability to move as fast as bikes — at least on campus — without having to worry about finding a place to park when they reach their destination. They have more maneuverability, allowing for last-minute shortcuts, quick stops and, of course, collision prevention.
People who ride longboards also tend to be more spatially aware, as that awareness is an integral part of riding them. A campus with more longboarders would automatically become a campus with more conscientious commuters.
Bike reform at USC is certainly necessary. Many of the proposed programs sound fantastic. Still, the programs can only do so much for a problem that really comes down to one factor: an excess of bikes.
 
Francesca Bessey is a freshman majoring in narrative studies. 
How about increasing the amount of time between classes from 10 minutes to 20?  Perhaps with more time allotted students wouldn’t have to race from one end of campus to another.  Just a thought.
Skateboarders and longboarders are the causes of most accidents I have personally witnessed. They expect everyone to move around them, and if they get too close to someone they just hop off, sending the board flying into people/bikes/etc, which is a catalyst for more accidents. Most skateboarders I have seen attempt to swerve too close to pedestrians and bikers. I don’t think that a campus with more skateboards and longboards would be safe at all.
I commute by bike to USC every day.  I will welcome the bike lanes and some order to the biking on campus.  Speeding, making sudden U-turns, riding on the wrong side of the road just make the situation more chaotic.  I don’t ride when I am on campus now for that reason.   And as a pedestrian, I will welcome the chance to walk down Child’s Way without getting hit by speeding bikes for a change.
Just limit bikes to main roads or walkways and restrict all other pathways to walking or other noted above. People go to USC because the campus is convenient to the living situation. If bikes are not allowed people will find it much more difficult to get to campus, to class on time!, and might even start DRIVING which would probably crush this author’s hopes and dreams…
The author’s solution to the bicycle congestion on campus is to reduce the number of bikes. Wow – brilliant. I would like this “solution” to be applied to car congestion in LA… I am not saying USC students are naive but this article has all the makings of an author thinking problems are solved when you wish the bad stuff away. Other then converting current bicyclists into longboarders, is there a real proposal here in eliminating bikes?
“People who ride longboards also tend to be more spatially aware, as that awareness is an integral part of riding them.”
What on earth does this mean? This is honestly some of the worst journalism I’ve ever seen. Apparently you can be blind to ride a bike…

April was a big month for drugs. From Rihanna rolling a blunt on top of some guy’s head at Coachella to Santa Cruz’s renowned 4/20 celebration, people of all ages, cultures and beliefs got together to enjoy themselves. So why is marijuana legalization taking so long?
April also saw leaders meet for the Summit of the Americas. In an attempt to minimize drug violence, Latin American leaders at the summit pushed for the decriminalization of marijuana.
In response to this approach, President Barack Obama said, “It is entirely legitimate to have a conversation about whether the laws in place are ones that are doing more harm than good in certain places. I personally and my administration’s position is that legalization is not the answer.”
With that said, the drug war will continue to fill up jails and waste taxpayer money and law enforcement time, all while still failing to find a solution to a pervasive, international problem.
Decriminalizing and taxing drugs could bring new resources to our still-fragile economy. Better yet, pump the new money into education reform. Dwindle down student debt, give teachers their jobs back and look into the research of active learning programs. The best way to stop the abuse of dangerous drugs is to better educate society.
Late last year, Gallup released annual survey results stating that 50 percent of Americans — a record high — favor the legalization of marijuana.
“If this current trend on legalizing marijuana continues, pressure may build to bring the nation’s laws into compliance with the people’s wishes,” the poll stated.
This is already happening at various levels around the nation. In 2011, Arkansas, California, Connecticut and Kentucky passed laws that lowered the penalties for the use and possession of marijuana. Colorado and Washington are now considering taking the next step: legalizing marijuana for recreational use.
With 50 percent of Americans now in support of the legalization of marijuana, the political liability is minimal. Public opinion, however, has yet to effect change on the federal level.
In 2008, more than half of Obama’s votes came from citizens under the age of 30, the same age group that supports cannabis policy reform. Marijuana is more than a recreational drug. It impacts many facets of American life, and could play a huge role in the 2012 presidential election. Students, as potential voters, should pay attention.
 
Andrew Gomez is a senior majoring in philosophy politics and law. His column “Bête Noire” ran every other Thursday.
I am all for legalizing pot if we do not have to spend more tax dollars treating idiots that can not control themselves and get strung out on smoking weed. Just do not ask me for more tax dollars and I am all for pot being sold in 7/11
In fact I think it would be hilarious if Walmart is the one to finally put a big dent in the drug kingpins in South America
Who the hell gets “strung out” smoking weed?

As if soon-to-be college graduates need any more reminding, the Associated Press reported Monday that one in two new graduates is jobless or underemployed. According to the news agency, job prospects for the class of 2012 are the lowest they’ve been in a decade.
These findings appear to be a rehash of what’s already been said countless times before. The media beats these negative messages into college students’ heads repeatedly: Good luck finding a job. Your major is in English or music? You might as well give up.
Though there’s no underplaying that our economy continues to struggle, the media continually sensationalizes the challenges that this presents for college graduates. Regardless of one’s major, there are certainly steps every student can take to weather the post-graduation storm.
As early as freshman year, students should take the initiative to learn about potential careers and get real experience. Imagine how impactful it would be if an underclassman attended and, that far ahead of the game, learned what types of jobs overlap with their field of interest and what skills recruiters look for.
No matter what, however, students need to be realistic. Students should not only research the careers that interest them, but rather explore different careers’ hiring potential. This is not to say that students should give up pursuing their dream job. Rather, they should take ownership and ground themselves in the fact that keeping options open and acquiring a transferable skill set might make the difference between employment and unemployment.
There’s no denying today’s college graduates face an unprecedented and difficult hiring climate. But by starting early, acquiring work experience, networking and being practical about the hiring prospects of the jobs they want, students can look past the media’s negative messages and put themselves in a much more attractive position to receive a highly coveted employment offer.

Industrialization began with modest advances in technology that made once-tedious tasks quicker. The second wave of innovation utilized assembly lines, factories and specialization of manual labor to create a mass consumer culture where former luxury products turned into products the average citizen could afford.
Max Rubin | Daily Trojan
This culture has persisted for so long that it is generally accepted as the way things are, but that era is coming to a close. We are entering a third revolution in technology, one in which menial manufacturing tasks are becoming automated.
What many Americans fail to notice, however, are the potential implications of such a dramatic change in infrastructure. Policymaking that developed in response to our current culture will have to accommodate a culture where mass production and low- to mid-level jobs aren’t such a predominant force in the economy. As students, we’ll need to adjust our plans for entering a job market in which many potential careers no longer exist.
In many ways, Henry Ford’s idea on manufacturing remains the default: Employing hundreds of factory workers to produce large quantities of a homogenous good. This demand for unskilled labor has shaped the job market for the working class, but as software advances, the need for manual laborers decreases. Soon, they might become entirely unnecessary.
This phenomenon doesn’t just affect factory workers. Many semi-professional jobs are beginning to become dispensable. Thanks to ATMs, for example, I can hardly remember the last time I talked to a bank teller. Previously, software for machines had a margin of error large enough to require humans for certain jobs; now, an ATM can read a check accurately on its own.
The implications of such changes are global. Currently, many automated jobs are outsourced to countries with cheap labor. If cheap labor is no longer needed, the majority of production will likely move back to first-world countries.
This development could have an enormous impact on the balance of global power: Whether a country is an economic powerhouse will depend on its ability to produce the best scientists, engineers and entrepreneurs. If masses of laborers no longer matter, neither will a country’s population size.
The increase in automation and customization will also change the way we perceive the job market. On one hand, smart machines could cause an enormous spike in unemployment; on the other, it could cause an incredible increase in jobs requiring creativity and innovation.
Just as agriculture allowed members of society to specialize in occupations unrelated to basic survival, automated machines could provide people with the opportunity to focus on art and intellectual pursuits.
Positives and negatives will exist in a future where manufacturing is about software rather than labor. We’ve reached a level of technological advancement where economics, class and global policy are going to have to radically change.
We also need to consider how these changes could affect our educational and career paths, especially as students. Success in higher education and students’ majors will become much more important as professions requiring specialized skills become central to the economy.
Careers won’t be limited, however, to science-oriented fields. As mid-level jobs decline, society will be more capable of supporting less technical professions. Engineering will still matter — but fewer people would turn their noses up at a degree in English.
 
Burke Gibson is a freshman majoring in economics.
“As mid-level jobs decline, society will be more capable of supporting less technical professions.”  ???
… so, as mid-level jobs decline
… then, obviously, more low-level jobs will be the increasing majority
… thus, in the future, more (lower-skilled) people will not need invest time to learn challenging skills. 
Yep… maybe that’s where the world is really headed … more English majors because we really need more non-skilled people to staff the McDonald’s of the world.
Geez.  What an amazing article! :-?
not.
I realize you are only a freshman. First, where is this unspecified “mass consumer culture”? Second, the “first-world” is an obsolete cold war term-you sound like the Romeny campaign. Also, It would enhance your argument to provide some examples of the technological advancements of the future you mention. Also the process you are talking about is it referred to as the degradation of labor that originates back to Federick W. Tylor concept of scientific management during the Progressive era. I encourage you to read Harry Braverman Labor and Monopoly Capitalism. Most disturbing is that your argument left no room for historical contingency, unintended consequences, ‘externalities’ e.g environment  and most especially human agency.  Labor and social movement have been critical force of historical change. Everything from Occupy to Egypt, will ensure that technology and those with “specialized skill” to create them will not solely determine our global future. In short you are being technologically deterministic.
Not sure what they are teaching in Econ these day but its certainly not reality.
—
Unions are going to be doing more harm then good if they do not wake up and smell the jobs fleeing to China. Unless they realize the true value of their labor in this global economy, their labor will no longer be needed.
Good article.  One thing to note about the future of manufacturing in America is that as the technology improves to automate as much as possible, the unions will fight back, in order to maintain status quo for their members, and that will be the biiggest  hurdle for companies to overcome.  The reason we have lost much of our mfg prowess is due to the very tit grip the unions have over these companies.
Ford runs a fully automated auto plant in Brazil.  That plant does not exists in the US because the unions wont allow it.  If you young people can resist the union pressures to  join, you and the country will be a lot better off in the long run.  Union shops slow down progress and union bosses only want to maintain their “elite”position in the work force.  Union officials want more union members in order to protect themselves from eventually losing their jobs.  Unions had their day.  Now it’s time to move on to a more productive model of employment for you and for greater opportunities for companies kickstart the manufacturing industry agin in America.
Good luck……..

Los Angeles natives, Nacosta is gearing up to release its second EP, “Liquor Eyes.”
Ever since the band’s fall release of its debut EP, “Wilderness City,” Nacosta has made its mark in Los Angeles, Hollywood and even at the SXSW music festival by performing at a multitude of venues in the area.
While the band stayed busy booking gigs, Nacosta spent a great deal of time at White Rose Studio, where it recorded its new three-track EP.
“We are very excited to share them,” said vocalist Brandon Graham.
“Liquor Eyes” begins with “Secret Destroyer” and a bass solo that sets the perfect psychedelic tone the band strives for. At one point, there is a cool moment in the chorus that is reflective of Muse’s music and drawn out vocals.
The guitar parts in every track create an enticing vibe that reflects the times of the 1960s and 1970s.
Nacosta’s influences, Nick Drake and Sonic Youth, are definitely prevalent in its music, but the new EP still has an organic and fresh appeal.
The title track, “Liquor Eyes,” is a beautiful song filled with several layers and textures created by the plinking of a guitar and lightness of a keyboard.
The EP ends with a track that is obviously different from the rest. “Coldwater Canyon” plays around with a more soulful groove. The band blended its ambient folk rock roots with a more modern sound.
“Liquor Eyes” will be available on Bandcamp, Soundcloud and Facebook on May 1 for free.

The Festival de Cannes, one of the most prestigious film festivals in the world, recently released its lineup of films.
The film festival will open on May 16 with a screening of Moonrise Kingdom, Wes Anderson’s first live action film since 2007. The film stars Bruce Willis, Edward Norton, Bill Murray, Frances McDormand, Tilda Swinton and Jason Schwartzman.
This particular year marks the return of a number of well-respected filmmakers, who have previously won prizes at the film festival. The filmmakers and their respective films include Jacques Audiard (Rust and Bone), David Cronenberg (Cosmopolis), Matteo Garrone (Reality), Michael Haneke (Love), Abbas Kiarostami (Like Someone in Love), Ken Loach (The Angels’ Share) and Cristian Mungiu (Beyond the Hills).
The film festival will also welcome the premieres of Andrew Dominik’s Killing Them Softly and John Hillcoat’s Lawless. Killing Them Softly boasts an impressive cast that includes Brad Pitt, James Gandolfini and Ray Liotta. The filmmaker previously directed Brad Pitt in The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford. Lawless, which stars Shia LeBeouf, Tom Hardy, Gary Oldman, Guy Pearce, Jessica Chastain and Mia Wasikowska recently premiered its trailer.
Jeff Nichols’ Mud will also screen in competition, as will On the Road, the much-anticipated adaptation of the Jack Kerouac novel. Alain Resnais’ film, You Haven’t Seen Anything Yet, which is reported to be his last feature film, will also participate in the film festival.
In the Un Certain Regard section, Cannes welcomes 23-year-old prodigy, Xavier Dolan. This marks the young filmmaker’s third film and third appearance at the festival. The filmmaker’s previous films (I Killed My Mother and Heartbeats) both walked away with prizes.
The several omissions in the lineup include Derek Cianfrance’s The Place Beyond the Pines and Paul Thomas Anderson’s The Master. Derek Cianfrance’s Blue Valentine premiered in Cannes in 2010.
Terrence Malick’s upcoming film was missing from the lineup, undoubtedly because of post-production. The filmmaker was in Cannes just last year and walked away with the Palme d’Or for his film, The Tree of Life. Wong Kar-Wai’s The Grandmasters, which many hoped would be ready for the festival, has also faced post-production delays.
The closing film for the festival will be Claude Miller’s Thérèse Desqueyroux, which the French filmmaker was working on at the time of his passing.
The 65th annual Festival de Cannes will run from May 16 until May 27, 2012.
