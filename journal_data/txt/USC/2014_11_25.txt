 
Nearly 300 protesters engaged in a second day of demonstration Tuesday night throughout the  downtown Los Angeles area in response to the non-indictment of Darren Wilson in the fatal August 9 shooting of Michael Brown.
The protest originated at Martin Luther King Boulevard and Crenshaw Boulevard, approaching the southeast border of the USC University Park campus at approximately 6 p.m. The east side of campus was closed off as a result. Protesters congregated under the 110 overpass near Flower Street and Jefferson Boulevard, crowding around police cars with one demonstrator jumping on the hood of the vehicle.
Following this, the group marched for more than two hours up Figueroa Street, reaching the Los Angeles Police Dept. headquarters in downtown Los Angeles around 8 p.m.
Along the way at multiple intersections, the protesters would “shut-down” the area by sitting down for four minutes, representing the four hours that Michael Brown’s body was left after he was shot in Ferguson, Missouri.  There were a string of chants shouted during the march, including, “Justice for Michael Brown, we will shut this city down” and “From Ferguson to L.A., these killer cops have got to pay.”
The protest proceeded down Figueroa Street with demonstrators in the front with linked arms and a crowd of roughly 300 people behind them. Reaching downtown Los Angeles, the protest culminated at the LAPD headquarters, where lines of officers had formed as a human barrier.
Though the demonstration was mostly peaceful, there were certain tense encounters between protesters and LAPD. Traffic cones and water bottles were thrown by some demonstrators at LAPD officers, and in another instance, a string of young men were shouting “F-ck the police” inches away from the faces of presiding officers.
At roughly 9:15 p.m., a group of nearly 100 protesters splintered off from the group at the LAPD headquarters and marched and entered onto the 101 freeway, which was subsequently closed. They shut down traffic for roughly half an hour before being dispersed by police.
Lana Payton, a second year cinematic arts-critical studies graduate student, joined demonstrators outside of the LAPD headquarters. She stressed the need for more action beyond just holding protests.
“We have to move in a different direction and that’s economic,” Payton said. “That means boycotting systems that support this institution — beyond Black Friday and beyond Cyber Monday — and really hitting America where it hurts the most, which is their pockets. That’s something everyone can participate in.”
The protests organizers announced that there will be another demonstration tomorrow at 3 p.m. outside the Los Angeles County Superior Court.

USC students gathered in a peaceful protest around Tommy Trojan on Tuesday morning in solidarity against institutional racism. There was widespread disappointment among the protestors regarding the grand jury’s decision on Monday night to not indict officer Darren Wilson in the fatal Aug. 9 shooting of black teenager Michael Brown.
Four USC students, Danielle Hixon, Alec Tiffany, Koryn Frye-Fuentes, and Mariah Phelps, created a Facebook event dubbed “Ferguson: No Indictment,” urging fellow Trojans to wear all black clothes and join them in solidarity at Hahn Plaza.
Some of the posters held up by students in attendance read: “I’m ‘sorry’ my skin color makes it easier for you to vilify me,” “No more racist police,” “Clean protest: Will the media show this?” and “Black lives matter.”
During the event, which lasted from approximately 11 a.m. to 1 p.m., demonstrators were invited to stand up and speak if they chose to do so. Students of all ethnic backgrounds got up and shared words of disappointment and heartbreak, along with words of love and appreciation for those who decided to join in the fight against racism.
One of the speakers was Andrianna Ayiotis, a sophomore majoring in biomedical engineering, who joined the protests on Figueroa Street Monday night.
“I’m a white girl, and I’m sorry because I have not experienced the racism, the institutional discrimination that a lot of you have,” Ayiotis said. “And last night, I joined in the protest and somebody said, ‘All you white folk who are here, please go up in the front because the police are not going to hurt you.’ And that’s not okay.”
One demonstrator spoke out about her discontent with some insensitive comments posted by USC students on Yik Yak, a mobile-phone application that allows for the publishing of short anonymous blurbs by people within a certain mile radius of college campuses. Some of the posts included: “Black lives matter x3/5” and “Black lives do matter, but white lives matter just a little bit more.”
For part of the demonstration, students laid down to show the injustice in law enforcement’s leaving of Brown’s body on the sidewalk for four hours after Wilson shot him. Many speakers at the rally discussed how the police’s actions toward Brown made it seem like they felt Brown’s life did not matter.
Students also recalled what they initially felt after hearing the grand jury’s verdict.
“I was sad, but my initial reaction was numbness. I think that’s what made me sad,” said Asha Anderson, a junior majoring in political science. “It wasn’t necessarily the verdict or the decision itself but the fact that I’m so numb to this happening. So many people have been killed in a similar way and there is a lack of justice.”
She went to on mention how she believes much of one’s possibility to succeed in this country is dependent on race and economic factors.
“ I think the legal system is a process that can work, but I think it’s a big issue the way that it’s set up in our country—your ability to get what you want in society depends on your access and the amount of money you have, and sometimes your skin color as well,” she said.
Princeton Parker, a senior majoring in communication who spoke during the rally, told the Daily Trojan afterward that no matter how many protestors were participating in rallies, people should be cognizant of the symbolic struggle.
“Our existence is the legitimization of our struggle,” Parker said. “We walk past these rallies all the time and we’re like, ‘Oh, it’s not the big of a deal, it’s like 30 people, it’s 40 people, it’s one person,’ but if one person is going through it, if five people are going through it, if 10 people are going through it, the struggle exists. I want to try to push that, that if this is something that keeps happening, it says very clearly that there is a problem.”
These protestors are not interested in justice; they’re interested in promoting a delusional personal narrative, which is part of a larger agenda designed to create a “feel good” society.  
Justice is based on facts and evidence, not on feelings.  The protestors are not interested in facts and evidence.  Hordes of Ferguson protestors took to the streets to begin their violent rampage before even reading the hundreds of pages of testimony released from the Michael Brown proceedings.  And of the many thousands of other protestors who have since joined the “justice” crusade, how many have actually taken the time to read the aforementioned documents?  I would bet it’s a very small percentage…  Without having taken the time to study the available evidence surrounding the case, it’s impossible for these protestors to say they’re fighting for justice.  What they’re fighting for is a pre-determined outcome they feel to be true and “good.”  
But even if Darren Wilson were the monster protestors claim he is, but the evidence suggests he isn’t, it seems an absurd hypocrisy for this group that supposedly decries stereotypes to protest “racist police” nationwide (consider the photo showing protestors camped outside of LAPD headquarters) as if to say all police officers are the same as one single officer thousands of miles away.  Isn’t that a bit stereotypical?  
Thus, this protest movement stays true to neither to facts nor principles, with senseless anger at the establishment seeming to serve as its main guiding force and the protestors seeking to relieve that anger above all.  Protestors put down police in a seeming attempt to feel better about themselves. But life isn’t always fair, people aren’t always nice–regardless of your skin color.  Individuals must move past feelings of victimization, as countless others have, including the current President of the United States, who is one of the most powerful leaders in the world despite, incidentally, being a man of color.  
What happened to Michael Brown is tragic.  We must constantly work to improve our society so that young people aren’t being killed, regardless of the circumstances.  But in this particular case, we can’t allow our grief, understandable as it may be, to cloud our judgment to the point of fighting for a nonsensical cause.

Dark smoke cloaked the town of Ferguson, Missouri last night. Storefronts and cars went up in flames. Rioters threw rocks, batteries and bottles. Thieves waited until chaos was in full force and looted any business that wasn’t already burning.
Bedlam in Ferguson was the result of a much-awaited decision on the indictment of officer Darren Wilson for any charges related to 18-year-old Michael Brown’s death, and the decision was not to indict.
The country’s response to the decision was one of shock and in some instances outrage, but in a case as polarizing as this, there was bound to be an emotional response. Here on campus, the mayhem represents a racial conflict that, if left unsolved, will become a heavier and heavier burden for our generation to carry.
The grand jury’s job was not to charge Wilson, but rather to determine whether there was enough evidence to send him to criminal court. Nine out of 12 jurors must agree on the decision to not indict for the decision to hold, and last night, nine of 12 decided there was not enough evidence to take Wilson to trial.
Years of criminal justice statistics show that our system is guilty of racial discrimination. For example, one in three black men will face prison in their lifetime. 65 percent of inmates serving life for non-violent crimes are black and only 18 percent are white. For more numbers, just Google “discrimination in the criminal justice system.”
In his official statement, President Obama acknowledged the need for criminal justice reform, but more importantly, he acknowledged the hopefulness of the situation: America is more than capable of making reformative change.
“We have made enormous progress in race relations over the course of the past several decades. I’ve witnessed that in my own life,” the President said. “And to deny that progress I think is to deny America’s capacity for change.”
The Brown family released a similar statement regarding positive change: “While we understand that many others share our pain, we ask that you channel your frustration in ways that will make a positive change. We need to work together to fix the system that allowed this to happen.”
The Brown family’s final remark was “let’s not just make noise, let’s make a difference.”
If you believe that justice was not served, exercise your first amendment rights to speech and assembly. Today at Tommy Trojan, a group of students will “stand in solidarity” against the lack of an indictment; if you think an indictment was deserved, join them.
If you believe more can be done to eliminate racial discrimination in the justice system, write a letter to your congressman. The Brown family is suggesting legislation to require officers to wear body cameras; it that’s legislation you support, speak up.
Violence, vandalism and directionless noisemaking is not only ineffective and irresponsible, but also disrespectful to the Brown family.
The jury has made their choice. Do not sensationalize this case without taking responsible measures to fix the problem at large. Educate yourself, and if you think action is necessary, take action. To do anything else would be to further cloak Ferguson and the rest of the country in smoke.
The old whoa is me BS that they are being picked on. Facts should also state the obvious that they were given the same opportunity a the white, brown and asian student to go to school and learn. They chose to learn thug which was not an offered class, therefore cheating themselves out of advancing. So stop the blame crap and put the focus on them and call a spade a spade.
First, it’s “woe is me.” Also, the first sentence is a fragment. In the second, “student” should be plural. I pick up on what you’re saying in the third, but it still doesn’t make the least bit of sense. The last sentence is a series, so it should have commas (see: the rest of the tirade). At what equal-opportunity school did you “choose” to learn grammar? #choosethug
Protestors don’t seem interested in facts.  It’s amazing how many people can be so sure of Darren Wilson’s guilt without A) having witnessed the incident, B) having been on the grand jury, or C) having read the hundreds of pages of testimony released from the case.

I’m not here to offer any thoughts on what happened between Michael Brown and Darren Wilson, on whether or not Brown deserved to be shot or deserves justice, on whether or not Wilson was justified or monstrous. And frankly, I don’t think anyone who was not present that fateful night has any business expounding thoughts on the incident itself. There’s too much fluff going around on the airwaves right now; we don’t need any more of it.
I will rant, however, about the aftermath of last night’s announcement of the grand jury’s decision not to charge Wilson with anything. Shortly after the decision was proclaimed, fiery riots broke out in Ferguson, Missouri. Whether they were provoked by police brutality or incited by misguided youngsters does not matter; the fact is that they happened. Meanwhile, in urban cores across the country, from New York and D.C. to Oakland and L.A., moderately sized and relatively peaceful protests erupted. In some of these cases, police standoffs resulted in minor amounts of violence –– for example, the Los Angeles Times reported a “shoving match” between protestors and officers, at least one detainment near City Hall and the firing of several projectiles into a crowd by police.
Thankfully, this region of the country did not descend into the bacchanalian frenzies of violence many pundits feared it would, and what violence occurred remained contained. Having said that, it’s important to address a point of view largely excluded from the social media flurries in this controversy and many others –– that of the moderates, those who care for social justice yet demand a reverence for law and order on the part of all citizens.
There’s a large segment of the media, augmented by social media, that specializes in the outrage industry, hopping from issue to issue and peddling politically correct, technocratic yet simple solutions to social evils as diverse as sexual assault, climate change, and racial injustice. Many dollars are spent on condemning all critics of these “solutions” as reactionaries, oppressors or worse. Meanwhile, and definitely worse, this sort of marginalization of dissent as heresy creates a true breed of heretics –– the reactionaries on the Right who, offended by the decadent Left’s self-righteous hubris, refuse to recognize the said social evils for the evils that they are! They proceed to deny that such issues as inequality, plutocratic corruption, and social intolerance are even problems. No feedback loop can be more self-perpetuating.
On the one side are the acolytes of fairness who will go so far as to violate that first law of civilization, order, in pursuit of what they call justice. On the other side are the patrons of stability who will ignore that first law of humanity, justice, out of pure deference to law and order. Both views grow ugly in their extremes, and neither contributes much to the actual resolution of the problem. The Left sends out the masses to march in futile protest against “The Man,” while the Right snidely sneers from its own Ivory Tower. Meanwhile the roots of the issue remain unaddressed.
In this particular case, I think the Left is at far more fault than the Right. Trial by jury was nearly turned into a kangaroo court by a media culture which, like that of the musical Chicago, favors emotional sensationalism and popular opinion more than time-tested standards of law and justice. A Manichean dichotomy of good versus evil, us versus them, energized those who demanded what they saw as justice for Michael Brown. And after the verdict was announced, coverage of the protests and marches often took a triumphalist flair of the Les Mis-like type. It must have been lost on the reporters, though, that frankly far fewer people care about perceived racial injustice now than they did in the past. A mere 300 to 400 protesters turned out in L.A. last night, a number that pales in comparison to the thousands who took to the streets in the Rodney King Riots or the hundreds of thousands who marched on Washington with Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. “Injustice” struck a far more serious and relevant chord in the hearts of the masses back in the ’60s than it does today.
This is not to say that racial issues are unimportant. Not in the slightest. The appalling inequality of opportunity between the White and Asian communities and the Latino and Black communities ought to be one of policymakers’ primary concerns today, and the unintentionally self-perpetuating decimation of the Black family through such feedback loops as irrational drug laws and property tax-funded public schools is a prime example of a system that, while not consciously racist, disproportionately disenfranchises the least privileged while the most privileged live content. The law of justice demands that, as a nation, we look for innovative solutions to address these problems from hell, not only out of a spirit of empathy for the least privileged members of our national community, but also out of a sense of pride in the true potential of our nation.
But this is a far cry from proclaiming that America is a racist country, that police across the country are waging a war on young black men and that we have made no progress from the bad old days of the Confederacy. I think I speak for many moderates when I say that the rhetoric of anti-racism is largely a guilt-inducing turnoff for the vast majority of Americans who did not pour out onto the streets last night, and that the culture of protest on college campuses is, as a mentor of mine once told me, “more fun than thinking.” As a country, we face serious issues that can only be resolved if we stand united rather than divided, thinking rather than feeling.
Perhaps President Lincoln can offer the best advice on this front: “With malice toward none, with charity for all, with firmness in the right as God gives us to see the right, let us strive on to finish the work we are in, to bind up the nation’s wounds…” President Obama has a wonderful opportunity to channel the Savior of the Union today. Let’s hope he takes it.

The family of Sam Levine and the Sigma Chi fraternity hosted a golf tournament on Nov. 15 at Brookside Golf Club in order to raise money for a scholarship dedicated to Levine, a student and member of the fraternity who died in Mexico during spring break in 2013.
Current members of Sigma Chi and their alumni were invited to attend the event. Levine’s family and many of his friends also attended.
Richie Maloof, chairman and founder of the Sam Levine Golf Classic, encountered difficulties in planning the event.
“It was difficult at first because I faced a lot of adversity,” Maloof said. Maloof is a senior majoring in real estate management and the scholarship chair of Sigma Chi.
Maloof consulted with members of other fraternities and organizations on campus to plan the event. Sigma Chi also reached out to the fraternity’s past alumni, as well as organizations on campus for donations. There was an anonymous donor who matched all donations made in Levine’s honor, so the fraternity was able to raise over $50,000 from the event.
“The response this year was amazing,” said Debra Levine, Sam Levine’s mother.
The event was held during Parents Weekend so that students’ families would also be able to attend. The golf tournament sold out. Sigma Chi shirts and hats were sold at the tournament in order to raise more money for the scholarship fund as well.
“The event was mainly for the fraternity and the fraternity’s parents,” said Debra Levine.
There was a banquet that followed the golf tournament to honor Levine. At the banquet, Maloof gave a presentation about Sam Levine’s character as a tribute.
Richie Maloof’s brother, Kevin Maloof, created a painting of Sam Levine that was given to his family.
At the banquet, there was also a raffle and prizes were given out to some of those who attended.
Lee Trevino, a retired professional golf player, was at the Sam Levine Golf Classic, which helped to promote the event.
“[The recipient] of the scholarship will be chosen based on academics, their involvement on campus, and other factors,” Maloof said. The rest of the money will be used to benefit the fraternity. According to Debra Levine, the money might be used to help create a new basketball court and to create a plaque in Levine’s honor since he enjoyed playing basketball.
In the past, the scholarship chair had only been responsible for planning the scholarship banquet, but Maloof has expanded his role and has started to award members of Sigma Chi with G.P.A.s higher than a 3.3 gift cards and scholarships.
This is the first year that a golf tournament was held in Sam Levine’s honor, but the fraternity plans to make it an annual event.
