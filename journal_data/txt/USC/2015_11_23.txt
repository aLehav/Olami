Students joined together in McCarthy Quad Monday night for the annual Conquest spirit rally and concert featuring artists Miguel and ILoveMakonnen. Conquest 2015 was the result of a combined effort by the Office of Campus Activities, Undergraduate Student Government Program Board, USG Concerts Committee and Trojan Pride in anticipation of the crosstown rivalry game against UCLA this Saturday.
Conquest included a Bruin Bonfire put on by Trojan Pride, a fireworks show and a Ferris wheel all in McCarthy Quad. Food truck vendors The Boba Truck, Kogi, Coolhaus, The Grilled Cheese Truck, Jogasaki and Farmer’s Belly opened for business at 5:00 p.m., followed by the opening of the Ferris wheel.
The next portion of the night was the spirit rally, beginning at 7:00 p.m. The rally included guest appearances from student groups, including the USC Cheer team.
“Conquest is really exciting because we know a ton of people are going to be there to watch us,” said Lindsay Luiz, an undeclared freshman on the USC Cheer team. “I’m nervous because it’s our first really big performance, but it’s fun to build up to the game on Saturday. We’ve been preparing for a long time and making a special routine just for Conquest.”
Athletes and coaches, the Spirit of Troy, Song Girls, Trojan Dance Force, Spirit Leaders, UnderSCore, Reverse Osmosis and Break Through all made appearances on the Conquest stage.
“There are a lot of moving parts to Conquest,” said Alya Omar, one of the student MCs for the rally. “My job is to keep things moving, help with transitions, make sure everything goes smoothly and keep students excited and pumped. This is one of my favorite events because it’s a really good unifier. All of the student groups are so talented and just really fun to watch.”
Miguel and ILoveMakonnen were announced as the featured performers on the Conquest Facebook event page on Friday. Miguel, a Grammy-award winning, critically acclaimed artist, and ILoveMakonnen, best known for his song remixed by Drake, “Tuesday,” pumped students up toward the end of the night. Previous Conquest headline performers have included Phantogram, Jason Derulo and Childish Gambino.
“I’m not a huge R&B or soul music fan myself, but I think Miguel and ILoveMakonnen are really diverse in their nature. They will appeal to a wide array of audiences in the student body,” said Leah Palacios, a freshman majoring in communication. “For the Welcome Back Concert we had more EDM style artists, which I thought was really cool. Something like pop rock would have been better at really making people pumped up for the game on Saturday.”
At the event, five students were randomly selected to predict the  halftime and final score of the USC-UCLA game on Saturday. Winners will receive $10,000.
The spirit of Conquest began even before the rally and concert Monday evening. Representatives from the Office of Campus Activities and Program Board hosted a variety of activities in front of Tommy Trojan since last Monday, Nov. 16. These mini events included free Conquest t-shirt and goodie-bag giveaways, Sprinkles Cupcakes.

KXSC, USC’s independent, student-run radio station, is once again gearing up for its annual KXSC Fest with an Ignite USC Fundraiser.
KXSC Fest is a popular event that has occurred in the spring at USC for the past seven years. With the promise of live music, art and film, the event attracts crowds from both the USC and greater Los Angeles community.
Unlike most Program Board concerts, however, KXSC Fest is a festival event. With a more diverse and up-and-coming lineup that includes bands across many different genres, KXSC hopes to attract a wide variety of people and encourage local USC and L.A. talent. In the past, KXSC Fest has featured artists like Flying Lotus, Thee Oh Sees, Nosaj thing, STRFKR, Dan Deacon and DJ Rashad.
“Our goal is really to find the future of music and bring it to USC,” said Liana Wertman, KXSC general manager.
In addition to the live music, KXSC Fest creates a festival vibe by engaging students with student art installations, live painting and food trucks. KXSC Radio provides a supportive community for creative expression that extends beyond just the music.
Last year, the KXSC Fest featured a “Digital Detox Lounge” modeled after the “Disconnect to Reconnect” space at the Outside Lands music festival in San Francisco. It was a device-free zone filled with bean bag chairs and inspiring decorations meant to promote interaction without technology.
KXSC Radio provides students with hands-on broadcast experience, promotes Los Angeles culture and broadcasts the sounds of USC to the world.
Alex Zhang, KXSC head of development, said the radio station stands by its broadcasting multiple genres.
“KXSC Radio represents a community that is inclusive,” Zhang said. “We don’t discriminate against any sort of music and take huge pride in retaining that culture. [KXSC Radio] is about people who love great music coming together to share music.”
Initially, KXSC Radio relied entirely on school-sponsored funding through the Undergraduate and Graduate Student Governments and the Political Student Assembly. Starting in 2013, however, the organization encountered financial hardships because of reductions in funding coupled with increases in prices. That same year, KXSC launched its very first fundraiser which, like KXSC Fest, has become an annual tradition.
College radio stations have been facing program closures throughout the country due to declines in funding. KXSC is determined to not let this happen at USC. Wertman said any donation will help support the festival.
“To make sure we can put on KXSC Fest this year, we need help from our listeners, friends and from the Trojan Family,” Wertman said. “We’re currently trying to raise $10,000, and any donation we can get makes a serious difference in what we are able to create for KXSC Fest.”
With the help of the donations from the Trojan Family and nearby communities, KXSC has been able to survive and thrive for the past several years, hosting some of the biggest and best KXSC Fests USC has ever seen, in addition to expanding its own broadcasting and programming.
During the entirety of their fundraiser, KXSC will be broadcasting 24 hours a day to make sure that the Trojan Family and greater L.A. community can tune in to see what student-run radio is all about. The Robot, KXSC’s mascot, will also be around campus handing out flyers and dancing with students.
KXSC has currently raised $1,587 towards their goal of $10,000 through their Ignite USC  fundraiser. Donations will be accepted until January 1, 2016. Donors can pledge between five and 500 dollars to claim various prizes and giveaways.

USC has taken initiatives to help reduce the food waste coming out of the dining halls on campus this semester by partnering up with the Chefs to End Hunger Program, which is bringing the leftovers from the dining halls to the surrounding community.
Kris Klinger, assistant vice president of retail operations for auxiliary services, said this was something that student groups have been clamoring for for the last several years.
“We’ve had a lot of student groups over the last year or two, in particular, come to us and say, ‘Hey, we want to help you with collecting leftovers to feed the hungry,’” Klinger said.
Klinger said the goal of the partnership is to have zero food waste on campus and the way the dining halls operate helps accomplish this.
“Our goal at the end of the day to have no food to throw away,” Klinger said. “We cook in small batches so it’s fresher and [comes out] more often. So that gives us the ability to limit production when necessary, and then when it’s slower, we try to cook to order. So that really eliminates waste if it’s done well and efficiently.”
However, not all of the dining halls’ food can be prepared in this way, which is where Chefs to End Hunger is helping.
“Where that can’t be done is with pastries and bread that are left out,” Klinger said. “So those are the items that we usually pull for the day. Those are the items that we usually end up sending on a daily basis.”
Liana Wertman, a senior majoring in history, thinks that it’s been a major accomplishment that Chefs to End Hunger has been willing to partner with USC at all.
“It’s tough with cooked food,” Wertman said. “A lot of the people don’t use all of the food that we end up buying, and if it doesn’t look right, they end up throwing it away. It’s really hard to get actual businesses to buy into that. It’s really easy to not do anything about that just throw the food away.”
The leftovers from the dining halls will go downtown due to the need for feeding the people in that area, Klinger said.
“Our food goes downtown. I think they try to keep it geographical, but it just depends on where they’re picking it up and where the need is.”
Evan Ishibashi, a junior majoring in business administration, thinks that having the food sent to Downtown will help further cement USC’s status as a leader in the local community.
“I think this is such a great thing,” he said. “USC does such a great job serving the surrounding communities in feeding the homeless and being involved in the elementary schools, middle schools and high schools.”
Ishibashi also suggested that food waste could also be reduced in the future by controlling the portions students are taking from the dining halls.
“As far as further steps, I think a lot of food is wasted on people overfilling their plates at the dining halls and just tossing it and not finishing it, and I think there should be some portion control,” he said.
However, Wertman felt that overall this partnership was a step in the right direction and that she’s proud that USC is a part of it.
“Food waste is a huge issue in America, and I’m proud to say that my school is doing something about it,” Wertman said.

The nice thing about social media spats is that you can instantly tell whether the person you’re arguing is actually worth your time based on their grammar skills.
There are many classic simple errors that are instant tip offs, but none bigger than your vs. you’re. 
One of them is a possessive pronoun. The other is a contraction. 
Tell that to “keyboard warriors” whose insults or credibility fall by the wayside the second they fail to demonstrate basic grammar knowledge.
“Your an idiot” is my favorite. First of all, it’s a dumb and shallow insult. Second, the irony is just overflowing. I’ve seen this on many Twitter replies, to which the only response necessary is “#your.” 
Our very own Alexis Bradby has another example: “Don’t reply your gonna say something dumb.” 
Most of the time, you can discern the person’s message even if they make a mistake, and that leads some to accuse the “grammar police” of being too picky. But this is basic elementary school grammar, not Oxford commas or dangling modifiers. Nothing irks me more than someone who doesn’t spend the time to get it right. 
So, the next time you throw out an insult to someone online, take a second to make sure you will even be taken seriously.

Little Sister offers flavorful Asian dishes that are not afraid to pack a spicy punch. Established during an explosion of new restaurants on 7th Street and Grand Avenue in Downtown, Little Sister has a cozy and inviting atmosphere that draws onlookers into a unique culinary journey. A mix of modern and rustic decor reflects the unusual array of dishes on the menu, with selections reminiscent of traditional Vietnamese cuisine presented in variations that are far from lackluster.
The “bo la lot” betel leaf wrapped grilled beef with scallion oil and peanuts was a fantastic way to start the meal. Every meaty, well-seasoned bite of the tender beef was punctured with a light sweet and sour sauce that did not overpower the star of the dish. The sauce gives the wraps a delightfully refreshing quality with a hint of spiciness at the end. The cilantro and peanuts provide traditional Vietnamese flavors that add another dimension to this simple yet satisfying appetizer.
The snapper filet with hot curry and dill really brought on the heat, so to those who err to mild tastes, proceed with caution. Flaky chunks of white fish encased in a lightly fried coating are drenched in a sea of chili oil and a medley of ginger, cilantro, green beans, bok choy pieces and peanuts. This dish offers some serious flavors that might call for a side of jasmine rice to temper.
The red and black rice served with a seafood fiesta turned out to be the star of the meal. When served, the rice sizzles in a hot stone pot and is served with lime wedges and a dish of sauces including a creamy lime leaf aioli, some of the aforementioned sweet and sour spicy sauce and a sweet chutney. The seafood dish also features sweet plump mussels still in the shell; fresh, juicy shrimp; and baby octopus and scallop soaked in the juices. Bits of Chinese sausage salute the origin of the cuisine while tender morsels of confit pork also and crunchy okra pieces give the dish some much needed color. And, of course, there is the obligatory smattering of peanuts and sprigs of fresh cilantro. The red and black rice is chewier than regular rice but manages to contain all the flavors without turning mushy. The dish isn’t too salty and even showcases a hint of sweetness. Coupled with the meatiness of the seafood and the pork, this dish is the perfect comfort food that is the Asian equivalent of a hearty stew.
Dessert for two comes in the form of a dulce de leche torte with chocolate hazelnut gelato and a hazelnut torte with dark chocolate ganache, as well as a surprise addition of a lemon tart meant for other patrons. The dulce de leche torte has just the right amount of sweetness, with a delightful fluffiness that sits well on top of a hearty meal. However, the chocolate hazelnut gelato cannot be ignored — smooth, rich chocolate with a hint of hazelnut, it perfectly complements the torte. The hazelnut torte is dense, with a rich, nutty flavor and a crunchy, buttery cookie base. Pieces of chocolate ganache crowning the slice add to the smoothness of each bite, without overwhelming the hazelnut flavor. The lemon tart, however, drastically departs from the rich depth of the other two selections, offering instead light, airy bites bursting with tart, refreshing lemony goodness. The berry jam spooned on top takes the edge off the tang and readies you for the next bite and the next bite.
Little Sister is an excellent place for any social function, whether for a casual meal or a formal gathering, though it can be a bit pricey. Located in the heart of up-and-coming downtown Los Angeles, it’s certainly a place for students to check out.

Last week, The Hollywood Reporter announced that it would cease its annual ranking of Hollywood’s 100 Power Women in Entertainment after 23 years. Last year, Anne Sweeney, president of Disney/ABC Television Group, graced the cover. The year before that, Oprah represented the powerful women in Hollywood. The list has had a broad range — from women such as actress Jennifer Lawrence, whose net worth is $60 million, to 29-year old movie producer Megan Ellison of Annapurna Pictures, who produced films such as Foxcatcher and American Hustle. Janice Min, THR’s editor-in-chief, said the main reason for the change is that the list “pits the town’s most impressive females against one another.” She describes circumstances where women have ended up publicly crying because of their ranking, and an Entourage episode inspired by the ranking wherein a female talent agent “strives and connives to up her ranking.” So, after all these years, THR and its sisterly music publication Billboard, which Min also heads, will no longer be honoring women by indexes and lists. Instead, the women will be featured in the same list as the men in THR’s annual top 100 Power Players.
I must admit that indexing the “Top 100 Women in Entertainment” seems a little archaic and crude in terms of diction, but I believe it is well-meant and, ultimately, much needed. The removal of such a list erases the idea that we are still desperately in need of progress and have a long way to go until it may be achieved. The removal of such a list may perpetuate the idea that equality for all has been achieved or is no longer an issue. Furthermore, it pits the women against the men once more, and probably — because of the unchanging status of Hollywood as male-dominated — will feature and celebrate fewer women, simply because of the ratio of successful women to men. So once more, we will have an imbalance of gender within the industry, despite the fact that THR is attempting to promote equality and respect.
But I think the true problem lies not with cataloguing the women, but rather the larger issue at hand, which has to do, in part, with the way women treat other women. Last week, The Hollywood Reporter dedicated an entire issue to beauty — the same very week, in fact, it announced the end of its Women in Entertainment rankings. The Beauty Issue featured dozens of articles on various hair stylists, makeup artists and every beauty guru in between who turns Hollywood’s celebrities into the best looking versions of themselves. The same celebrities who grace the cover of fashion and lifestyle magazines, and create such intense standards by which every “normal” — and by that, I mean, non-famous — woman compares herself to at some point in her life. In this paradox, the Power Women issue was scorned, but the Beauty Issue continued. This perpetuates and venerates these standards, celebrating the beauticians’ work that makes the already pretty perfect into the unattainable. Information that Reese Witherspoon uses three different blushes or that L.A. has seen a “lunchtime botox boom” is not realistic or helpful for everyday working women or students.
I’m not arguing that the Beauty Issue should be removed as well — I feel that would add me to the gang of internet bullies who finds fault with every little thing and perpetuates the fear of ridicule or shame in others. I understand that beauty is important, as it is a $62 billion industry. Rather, I find it odd that THR has decided to remove one institution that celebrates women and purportedly might create an environment of competition between women, while continuing another that, yes, celebrates, but also distresses women. This creates an unhealthy mentality that makes women feel lesser because they don’t look like that gorgeous movie star on the cover.
I think, as an alternative to “listing” women by number, they should have a general list that features phenomenal, powerful women in no particular order. That way the women wouldn’t feel as if they were less or more than others, and it would be less of a competition and more fully a communal celebration in all sense of the word. At the end of her editorial addressing why she feels that the list should be disbanded, Min mentions that the Latin origin of the word compete is “competere” which means “to come together.”
Removing the numbers but keeping the institution would further promote the success, influence and potential of women in the industry while removing the possible viciousness of the concept. Ultimately, THR’s actions, though well-meaning, are misguided and may prove to hinder the positive movement in women’s equality in the long run.

With Pixar’s summer release of Inside Out and the numerous accolades and box office numbers to back up its success, it seemed like the studio’s second original feature of the year, The Good Dinosaur, would have a lot to live up to. Furthermore, the film sparked early criticism when first glimpses showed an oddly cartoonish and wacky looking dinosaur — it seemed more fitting for a baby’s plush doll than the adult-friendly features audience members have come to expect from Pixar. Luckily, The Good Dinosaur surpasses these expectations and more than delivers.
Existing in an alternate reality where the infamous dinosaur-killing meteor never struck earth, The Good Dinosaur is about a young apatosaurus named Arlo who can’t seem to overcome his overwhelming fears. The runt of three siblings in an agrarian household, Arlo is relegated to menial jobs on the family farm, like feeding the chickens and cleaning up leaves. When his father dies after Arlo fails to kill the “critter” that’s eating their harvest, Arlo finds himself lost and far from home. His only company ends up being the very critter Arlo failed to kill: a tiny, non-speaking cavechild who walks on four legs like a canine and is nicknamed Spot. From there, the two begin their journey back to Clawed-Tooth Mountains but are confronted by crazy pterodactyls, vicious velociraptors, a never-ending storm, wrong turns and plenty of more bumps along the way.
Though the story may seem run-of-the-mill — besides the fact that it subverts the classic Disney trope of the mother dying — what truly elevates the film is the shockingly detailed and realistic scenery throughout. More than once, it’s almost impossible to discern whether or not the images flashing on screen are real or animated. Great roaming vistas, sloping valleys, rushing rivers and craggy mountains are painstakingly detailed and extraordinary, leaving the viewer filled with a great sense of wonder and awe long after the film is over.
Yet, simultaneously, the exceedingly cartoonish drawings of Arlo and his family come off as glaring and odd against these photorealistic backdrops, but soon it becomes clear that with all the trials and terrors Arlo faces, having the dinosaurs look too real would probably prove to be too scary for the intended younger audience. Therefore, the caricaturistic features of the animals in the film make it more approachable, while simultaneously astounding audiences with breathtaking landscapes from beginning to end. There are a few more serious issues with the film, however. At first, the human-like sowing and farming dinosaur family set in a sort of prehistoric Midwest seems like a strange choice for Pixar, which should be pushing diversity as much as possible. Arlo’s “Poppa” and “Momma” are voiced by actors with thick Southern accents, characters are named “Buck” and “Butch” and told they “showed real grit today,” and composer-duo Mychael and Jeff Danna underscore the action with twangy, Americana country music that makes the film initially feel like a campy trip back to Little House on the Prairie or something equally as corny and old fashioned. However, by the end it becomes clear that all that Southern charm and influence stems from an overarching metaphor that Arlo is in the wild, wild west. And that’s where the movie really finds its footing — in imagining a West with dinosaurs instead of people, a West where American imperialism isn’t allowed to exist and the humans of the time can’t even speak, let alone ravage a landscape or drive out its native inhabitants. Instead, the dinosaurs appreciate the land and live in somewhat harmony with it as well.
The only true trip-up in the film is the average-to-sub-par dialogue present in the beginning as the filmmakers are building the rules of the world around us. Thankfully, that kind of dialogue all but disappears a quarter of the way in, when the film centers on the unspoken and budding relationship between a dinosaur and his human counterpart and the adventure that unfolds before them.
The problem with this summer’s Inside Out lies in how the stakes didn’t seem to be that big for the protagonists and the adventure they went on really didn’t have that many hurdles. There seemed to be so many options to explore in the human brain — it didn’t really feel like the filmmakers dared to go that far. On the other hand, with The Good Dinosaur, the seemingly insurmountable trials and unending odyssey catapults the film from a good story to a great one. When Arlo finally reaches home — as, of course, we know he ultimately will — the payoff seems deserved and rewarded. He didn’t simply leap over a couple logs and find the river back but rather encounters terrifying obstacles every which way and traverses miles upon miles of the untouched landscape. This not only leaves the viewer with a warm feeling by the film’s end, but also a hankering to go visit some of our national parks and forests, which means the dinosaur really lives up to its name.

Hannah Luk | Daily Trojan
When I was 19, I learned what cultural appropriation was. It was in a classroom at Stanford University in a white professor’s lesson called “Why cultural appropriation is never OK.” The professor presented many examples of how cultural appropriation manifests itself. The one example that stuck with me was one that I had committed many times: wearing clothing with Native American patterns. After that lesson, I immediately went home and threw away the offending blouse.
Now, with Thanksgiving only days away, the revolving conversation about cultural appropriation is revving up once again.
Cultural appropriation is usually defined as the process of taking an element from a disenfranchised group and turning it into a commodity or entertainment. Though scholars and native tribes argue Native American culture is constantly misappropriated in this country, many times we never flesh out what is exactly so wrong with that.
But before we can do that, we must identify exactly what it is. Some notable examples of cultural appropriation from this past year were the mysterious case of Rachel Dolezal, Allure magazine proclaiming how white women can get an afro and Kerry Washington calling a fellow actress her spirit animal.
Defining cultural appropriation is also difficult because our society struggles with determining who is disenfranchised. It is an ideal time to do so on college campuses, though, because many campuses around the country are grappling with inclusion and giving enough voice to minority students.
Furthermore, in our increasingly globalized world in which cultures mesh together, we are exposed to so many concepts and societal elements. Universities are places where we are dedicated to gaining more insight into complex ideas. On campus and within classrooms are opportunities for professors to identify what is cultural appropriation and what is not.
We must widen the conversation around this topic. This conversation cannot take place within a vacuum, but among a diverse group of students like those at USC.
Universities have already started to expand the discussion around cultural appropriation. California became the first state to officially outlaw the use of the term “Redskin” for school mascots. Prior to this statewide decision, other universities have changed their mascots that were deemed culturally insensitive. As a Chicagoan, I notably remember when the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign discontinued its Chief Illiniwek mascot. Some non-Native American students and alums had tears streaming down their faces. An end of an era was occurring.
But it also beckoned a new era of better cultural awareness.
It opened up the path to conversation in an academic setting where perceptions could be challenged. More universities should continue pushing platforms of diversity by ridding their sports teams of culturally offensive mascots.
With that said, when it comes to deeming an act or fashion statement as cultural appropriation, we as a society must be slow to judge. We should focus on education. Cultural appropriation is rampant within the United States and will take a while to reverse. Many times when someone seemingly misappropriates a culture, it is out of ignorance and not malice. The role of the university can be to expose its students to more culture.
It’s like when new words are added to the Oxford Dictionary. It is after years of use, but finally academia deems them worthy of  official recognition. Now, is the time for us millennials in college to learn what cultural appropriation means and how it manifests itself. The boundaries of understanding are expanding, and with it, so should we.
One way USC can address this is by offering more culturally specific classes that build the conversation about cultural appropriation into the syllabus, instituting the diversity requirement within the general education courses or supporting multicultural groups on campus for students looking to learn more about ethnic groups.
Just like how I was schooled when I sat in on that class at Stanford, more college students can grasp what is meant by cultural appropriation. We just have to give people a chance to learn.
Therefore, students should take this break — in between eating turkey and completing their Black Friday shopping — to step outside themselves and truly learn about other cultures. Cultural diversity is one thing we can all be grateful for during this Thanksgiving season.
After reading “Wait An L.A. Minute” on Tuesdays, join Jordyn Holman in her millennial conversations on Twitter @JordynJournals. She’s a senior studying print and digital journalism.
“Cultural appropriation” is a process by which culture evolves. Who are you to tell people how to dress or how to cut their hair? Sounds like pretty oppressive behaviour to me!

This week, resolutions were introduced in the Undergraduate and Graduate Student Government Senates, urging the administration to provide spaces and funding to Syrian refugee scholars and students by joining the Institute for International Education’s Syria Consortium. In the coming weeks, the resolution will also be introduced in the Academic Senate, where it already has the support of more than 50 faculty members. At the core of these proposals is a recognition that the cause of refugee scholars and students is not a political or national security matter, but rather, a test of our commitment to the values of openness, tolerance and compassion that make our universities and our society great.
The resolutions were written in October, in response to news that Oxford University was moving to provide accommodation to Syrian refugee students and scholars. In doing so, Oxford joined more than 50 institutions —including Boston University, Notre Dame, Tufts and others — that took similar steps in the past five years. Given that USC was not yet on the list, and that it previously signed on to help refugee scholars from other countries by joining IIE’s Scholar Rescue Fund, it seemed an obvious area for action.
The need for such action is great. We are now in the fifth year of the Syrian Civil War. More than 200,000 people have died so far in the conflict, and 4.2 million people have fled the country. This 4.2 million is not a monolith. It consists of Arab and Kurdish Sunni Muslims; Alawite, Shia and Ismaili Muslims; Christians of various traditions; Syrian Druze; secular people; and others. It is a diverse group. A good part of that 4.2 million is of college age.
Recognizing the need to connect Syrian students and scholars with host institutions outside of Syria, the Institute for International Education founded the Syria Consortium in 2012. IIE is an organization that has, throughout its hundred-year history, helped find places of refuge for more than 600 scholars from 50-plus countries. During World War II, it helped to resettle refugees fleeing the Nazi regime. Currently, it is focusing its attention where the need is greatest — on Syria. Participating Consortium institutions work with the IIE to create a plan to host refugee scholars and students, allocating an amount that makes sense for the individual institution, ranging from small scholarships of fewer than $5,000 per student to full funding.
Institutions that take part in the Consortium are heirs to the tradition of the university as a refuge for those fleeing persecution. In the last century, students and scholars from Iraq, Vietnam, Cuba, the USSR and other countries found sanctuary at American colleges and universities, including here at USC. During World War II, refugee scholars such as Thomas Mann, Hannah Arendt and Albert Einstein were all offered places at American universities.
All students who come into the United States are subject to security checks by the State Department. This screening process lasts 18 to 24 months and is effective. According to The Economist, more than 780,000 refugees have come to this country since 9/11; in that time, three refugees were arrested on homeland security-related charges, comprising .000038% of the total population.
So, to be clear, providing refuge to refugee scholars and students is not about national security or politics. It is about morality. It’s about a moral obligation that we who live in countries that have not been scarred by war have to provide refuge to those who are being persecuted and killed. We cannot, in the president’s words, “close our hearts to the victims of violence.” We must, instead, live up to the proudest parts of our history and show the same kindness and humanity to Syrian refugee scholars as we have shown to so many millions of others in the past.

Moral obligations only fall on people, not institutions. The task of institutions is to serve the purposes of the members. The Syrian scholars should not receive special consideration only normal consideration like every other applicant.

Who would have thought? The one time we don’t get crushed in the first quarter we get crushed in the game. Maybe we should purposely tank the first quarter. Or maybe we should just win the game. The Trojans came into Eugene with a lot of momentum and left after getting punched in the gut, repeatedly. They played a great Oregon team on Saturday, but the game was winnable. We looked lost on some plays in the first half and gave Vernon Adams a wide-open receiver on almost every big play. I’m pretty sure I could have thrown the ball to those receivers. We couldn’t generate pressure early on and let Adams have a field day with our secondary. Don’t worry Trojans! There is good news. I actually have multiple pieces of good news. We beat UCLA, we go to the Pac-12 Championship. If we don’t beat UCLA, odds are we go to the Royal Purple Bowl and that gives us a perfect excuse to head to Las Vegas over the holidays.
Grades:
Quarterbacks: B-
I’m not going to lie, I expected Cody Kessler to come out sloppy and timid as he always does in big games. But that wasn’t the Cody Kessler I saw, well at least in the first half. He came out confident and made some big-time plays. That throw to Darreus Rogers was a thing of beauty and he had a couple of well-thrown balls to JuJu Smith-Schuster who surprisingly couldn’t reign them in. In the second half however, Kessler went back to throwing 4 yard passes on third and seven. We need the first quarter Kessler, not the second half Kessler. A lot of that depends on whether or not the offensive line can provide a lick of protection, and that seems doubtful.
Running Backs: B
What a game from Justin Davis! His performance was probably his best since he arrived at USC and it was in a big game. Unfortunately we had to play catch-up and could not abuse the dominance we had running the football with Davis. Ronald Jones II was very quiet for the second straight game, apart from a nice touchdown run. I’m not sure if it is the pressure or the lack of running holes, but hopefully Jones II can have the game of a lifetime against the Bruins this weekend in the Coliseum.
Wide Receivers: B
Darreus Rogers played his best game as a Trojan as well. Instead of being the blocker of the wide receiver corps, he showed that he has great hands and the capability to make big plays. Credit has to be given to JuJu Smith-Schuster as well. He was playing with a broken hand and a bum ankle, and I’m sure many other injuries. He showed undeniable determination to get back onto the field and that got a nod of approval from me. Tyler Petite also a caught a touchdown pass, but he did drop a great pass from Kessler where Petite got absolutely rocked. If you want the ball thrown your way, you have to prove you can catch the tough ones!
Offensive Line: F
For all the flak Cody Kessler gets on a daily basis, a lot of it should be directed to the offensive line. This group is not at 100% and are missing several key starters, but that doesn’t excuse the consistent lack of protection. Don’t even get me started on the constant penalties that seem to kill our momentum at every turn. The snaps were also very mediocre, but that is also understandable in the harsh environment that is Autzen Stadium. This group has one last chance at redemption against the Bruins. It is evident that change is necessary, and Bob Connelly is the first person to be looked at.
Defensive Line: C+
We needed a dominant performance from this group and we didn’t get it. The Oregon offensive line did a great job all afternoon and Vernon Adams proved to be elusive all game. The line did a reasonably good job at stopping the run, but for the most part they were a non-factor. Pressure on Josh Rosen is the only way we win the game against the Bruins so that needs to be a point of emphasis. The talent is there, but the scheming will be ever crucial to ensure we can dominate at the point of attack and assert our will against the Bruins.
Linebackers: C
All things considered, the makeshift group did a great job after losing their two starting middle linebackers. I hoped the emphasis on speed with the new linebackers could have been a difference maker in the game, but that was not the case. It wasn’t until the end of the game where we figured out how to use that speed to blitz and get pressure on Vernon Adams. Buddah Tucker showed some promise, but I was really hoping for a breakout performance from Osa Masina, who evidently tweaked his hamstring on a pass route. We are hanging by a thread and need a masterful performance against Paul Perkins and Josh Rosen on Saturday.
Secondary: F
This grade is pretty ironic considering we started the game with an interception. There simply is no excuse for how poor the secondary played on Saturday. There were countless blown assignments. I’m not sure if that’s on the players or coaching, but either way that is unacceptable. Adams didn’t even beat us with his arm. The majority of his throws were to WIDE OPEN receivers. It is known that Oregon likes to stretch the field with their gaudy yards per play average. Why we weren’t prepared is beyond me. If there aren’t some serious adjustments, expect Josh Rosen to have a similar game to Vernon Adams.
Special Teams: B+
Adoree’ became the first player to record an offensive, defensive, and special teams’ touchdown this year. While I don’t think he stands a chance to win the Hornung Award (best all-around player) because of Christian McCaffrey’s Heisman-worthy season, I think Trojan fans should be more than grateful we have such a dynamic player on our team. Alex Wood was sidelined with a concussion that I was not aware of until the start of the game. I thought Matthew Boermeester did an admirable job as a backup in moderately windy conditions. Even some of the punts were pinning the Ducks deep in their own territory. Not a bad day considering.
Overall: C-
It could have been a lot worse. We made a valiant comeback in the second half, but it just wasn’t enough. The odds were against the Trojans facing a hot Oregon team. The penalties killed us countless times and we just didn’t have what it took to beat a great team. When you get put into a hole that severe at halftime against a team like Oregon, you are asking for trouble. It seems like Coach Clay Helton’s audition for the job went sour. Odds are we will be looking elsewhere for our new coach next year. I’m looking at you John Harbaugh.
Prediction: USC 28- UCLA 26
I think the Trojans finally end the streak of losing to the Bruins. The main reason I believe that is because nothing that has happened in the Pac-12 this year has made any sense at all. I think UCLA scores late and goes for two to tie. Su’a Cravens makes the game winning stop at the goal line.
Fight On!

LAPD arrested an Uber driver Saturday night after he was accused of groping a female USC student while dropping her off near campus. 
At approximately 9 p.m. on Nov. 22, the student reported that the driver had groped her from behind as she was getting out of his car. The incident occurred as he was dropping her off on 30th Street, according to CBS Los Angeles. 
Immediately after the incident, the student used the LiveSafe app on her smartphone to report what had happened to campus security, who received the message at 9:05 p.m. According to CBS, the report DPS officers saw was so clear that they were able to spot the suspect approximately 10 minutes later. 
LAPD arrested the suspect, who has remained unidentified, and charged him with sexual battery. According to CBS, the driver has worked for both Uber and fellow ride-sharing company Lyft in the past. 
USC currently operates a free ride-sharing program with Uber in conjunction with Campus Cruiser. Students are encouraged to take Uber in the University Park neighborhood whenever wait periods for Campus Cruiser exceed 15 minutes, and the University covers the costs between 7 p.m. and 2 a.m. The USC Transportation website encourages students to “stay Uber safe” by traveling in pairs, verifying the driver and car and using the Uber app’s “share your ETA” function to alert friends to their estimated time of arrival. 
According to the DPS website, the LiveSafe USC Trojan Mobile Safety App allows users to initiate contact with emergency responders around the University Park and Health Science campuses.” The app is free to download and includes safety features such as immediate calls to DPS, easy reporting of suspicious or criminal activity and location services to notify friends of students’ route through campus. 
CAVEAT EMPTOR:
In Southern California Uber charges $1.00 per mile and $0.18 per minute (with no base starting fare as they apply in most of their other markets). Then, Uber takes 20-30% of this paltry sum. THEN, drivers have to apply operational costs and taxes against this paltry sum. What’s left, especially after transporting college students for what are mostly minimum fares that net drivers little to nothing (minimum fares net drivers $2.40 BEFORE deducting costs; any fare that takes a driver more than 4 miles to complete – from point-of-hail to drop-off – loses them money)? Certainly not a service that can retain any modicum of quality and safety for very long.
Uber passes 100% of ALL operational costs onto its misclassified independent contractors. It even coerces drivers into absorbing the “complimentary” costs of bottled water, gum/snacks, and chargers (that Uber tells riders to expect) under threat of “deactivation” (Uber’s “doublespeak” for fired) for failing to provide the “5-Star” experience of riding in an Uber. BTW, drivers who average less than 4.6 out of 5 stars are threatened with deactivation.
And ask yourselves this: if the job pays as well as Uber claims (which it obviously doesn’t) then why is the churn rate among its drivers so astronomically high in this flailing “sharing” economy?
Uber and Lyft claim that drivers can earn as much as $35 an hour and/or up to $1500.00 a week. This is more than many jobs that require a college degree can offer. If drivers could make this much money you would see a very different culture of drivers than that which exists in So Cal.
The truth is that, after totaling costs and taxes, Uber drivers in nearly every one of its markets is taking home well below minimum wage. All this for a very high-risk (drivers are 21-33 times more likely to be assaulted/murdered on the job than workers in any other sector), very low-paying job that destroys a vehicle’s resale value.
And consider the ethics of a company that tells riders not to tip, refuses to add in-app tipping (which all Uber’s competitors offer), and instructs its drivers to vigorously decline tips that are offered (which new ones will comply with out of fear of getting lower star ratings).
People are increasingly complaining that Uber drivers are getting worse, especially in So Cal/LA. Well, you get what you – and Uber – pay for.
Quality and safety have limited cost thresholds. Uber charges and pays well below this threshold.
“Sharing” economy my a**.
Shame, too. Uber had a golden opportunity and chose to lay a golden egg instead. At least they can make some goose soup.
Caveat venditor, Mr. Kalanick, caveat venditor.

Dear Tiffany,
My boyfriend and I have been together for five years. The relationship is stable, and I’m sure he loves me. But the thing is, he doesn’t really a goal in life and he is in his mid-twenties. He works during the day (service industry) and plays League of Legends at night. He’s not pursuing a college education. While I have tried relentlessly to help him find his passion, he turns down every possible career path or education opportunity that I have devised for him. Now that I’m at USC, I couldn’t help but wonder if I could explore some other possibilities, or just live carefree without any so-called restrictions. I just don’t know what to do. 
Thank you,
Confused girl
Your boyfriend could have an epiphany about his professional calling tomorrow, or he might never have one. He is entitled to live his life however he chooses even if it doesn’t live up to others’ expectations of what a 20-something should be doing. Though you are coming from a place of love when trying to stoke some grand ambitions, unfortunately, you can’t coerce someone into developing a passion. 
When you have spent five years with someone you love, it can be difficult to come to terms with the fact that it’s coming to an end. But if you find yourself wondering seriously about “other possibilities,” that’s a sign you’re ready to move on. Unless you can resolve your concerns about his lack of direction and let him figure it all out himself, he will never be good enough with his gaming and complacency hanging over your head. If this is the case, then it is unfair to both of you to continue this relationship.

The USC men’s water polo team claimed third place at the MPSF Tournament held at Uytengsu Aquatics Center over the weekend.
The Trojans beat Stanford in the quarterfinals on Friday, but on Saturday lost to UCLA in the semifinals. However, they came back strong on Sunday with an 8-4 win over Pacific in the third place game.
USC battled back from an early 2-0 deficit with consecutive scores from Blake Edwards in the second period. The first came just seconds after Edwards was stopped on a penalty shot, and then a minute later, Edwards converted again off a turnover forced by Chase Koplow to even the score at halftime.
The Trojans commanded the second half, taking the lead on a goal by Mihaljo Milicevic midway through the third period and Nick Lavayen scored a minute later for a 5-3 advantage. After Pacific responded with a goal to make it 4-3, USC scored four unanswered to pull away for the victory.
The win kept USC’s chances at an NCAA Tournament bid alive. 
“It’s a massive win,” Edwards said. “I’m so proud of all the boys. We were under a lot of pressure. Our season was on the line. We just implemented the gameplan perfectly today.”
However, the Trojans’ participation in the tournament is not a certainty yet, as it will likely be them and Pacific battling for the final bid from the MPSF.
“It’s just a great way to end the regular season,” goalkeeper McQuin Baron said on Sunday’s win. “If we don’t get the NCAA bid, that’s an amazing way for our season to end leading into next season.”
A 6-3 loss to UCLA Saturday in the semifinals put a temporary dent in the Trojans’ season. 
Despite outshooting the Bruins 25-23, the Trojans were futile on offense, taking more than 22 minutes to score their first goal, which came late in the third period.
USC was shutout through halftime and could only watch as the Bruins built up a 3-0 lead on two first period goals by Danny McClintick and a second period marker by Ryder Roberts.
The Bruins scored three more unanswered goals in the third period. Roberts tallied again and McClintick finished off a hat trick. A penalty shot by Alex Roelse with two minutes to play proved true, and UCLA took a commanding 6-0 lead into the final period.
Despite pressing on defense and hitting a number of posts, the Trojans, who finished 0-for-6 on the power play, came up well short of their crosstown rivals. Mihaljo Milicevic and Mac Carden finally delivered goals in the fourth period, but it was too little, too late.
“UCLA is a very good team,” Edwards said. “They probably have the best defense in the competition. We matched that defense this tournament but offensively we didn’t attack enough. We didn’t make bright decisions. We actually created a lot of offensive opportunities, but the decision making and shot selection was really poor.”
The loss was especially deflating considering the MPSF tournament started out victorious for the Trojans with a 7-6 overtime victory against the Stanford Cardinal Friday morning. The game was the second time this season that USC has defeated Stanford in overtime. 
Baron was one of two dominant Trojans in the game, becoming a defensive stalwart in the goal. He had a career-high 19 saves in the game. Baron held the Cardinal scoreless in both of the overtime periods.
The offensive star of the game was sophomore Grant Stein, who would score four goals for the Trojans in the game, including the go-ahead goal in the overtime. Freshman Chase Koplow got in on the action as well contributing two goals. Nick Bell also scored a goal for the Trojans in the game.
The Trojans earned their 11th straight trip to the NCAA Tournament after being awarded an at-large bid into this year’s tournament. They will next take on Claremont-Mudd-Scripps in a play-in game on Dec. 2 at Uytengsu Aquatics Center and if they win, they will advance to the NCAA semifinals.
