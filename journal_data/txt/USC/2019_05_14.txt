“Stop the silence to stop the violence. We’re going to say something. Do something.” 
On Saturday, over 50 community members gathered on the corner of Maple Avenue and Adams Boulevard, where USC student Victor McElhaney was shot and killed in early March, to call for the identification of the 21-year-old’s killers and justice for his family.
“We need the public’s help,” said Los Angeles City Councilmember Curren Price. “I hope that today’s gathering sends a clear, clear message. We are committed to finding these killers and bringing them to justice. We will not tolerate fear and we are not going to tolerate folks terrorizing our neighborhoods.”
The day before, McElhaney was honored with a posthumous degree in music studies with an emphasis in jazz during the Thornton School of Music’s satellite ceremony. 
Angelique Smith, mother of the late rapper Nipsey Hussle, said she wanted to spread light even in the face of immense darkness.
“We’re mothers who were affected by violence, [and] yet our main message is a message of love,” Smith said.
McElhaney’s parents Oakland Councilmember Lynette Gibson McElhaney and her husband Clarence McElhaney joined Price, Los Angeles County Supervisor Mark Ridley-Thomas, community activists and local nonprofit organizations in raising awareness for street gun violence. Members of Brothers Breaking B.R.E.A.D., an organization dedicated to uplifting black men at USC, and Black Student Assembly were also in attendance. 
“We will not rest until this matter is appropriately resolved and these perpetrators are brought to justice,” Ridley-Thomas said.
In the ongoing police investigation, the Los Angeles Police Department, who was also in attendance in solidarity, said they believe the suspects are three young Latino men, who fled the scene in a four-door dark-colored sedan. 
“We are asking for your help, the community’s help to partner with us, to partner with the family in identifying the suspects,” said lieutenant Dan Thompson. 
During the stand-in, attendees passed out flyers with information on the suspects and how to send in anonymous tips. Attendees also lit prayer candles and laid down roses in commemoration of McElhaney’s life. 
“I don’t know how to think of justice for Vic,” Lynette said. “We’ve got some men out there who … [have] taken guns, and they’ve taken my baby’s life. They need to be brought in to account for that action so that they can be restored. They don’t need to be at large where they can do harm to another mother’s child.”
Soldiers Against Violence Everywhere Center Oakland (S.A.V.E.), a nonprofit founded by Theresa Butler and Lynette that aims to end street gun violence, co-sponsored the event. The organization was started nine years ago and holds monthly stand-ins for gun violence victims in Oakland. 
“We started [S.A.V.E.] out of the church [the McElhaneys and I go to] and they have been part of it since the beginning,” Butler said.
Former BSA co-director Nia Warren said Victor McElhaney, whom she had known since childhood, taught her a lot about history, social justice and love.
“I see being a good person to an entirely new standard,” Warren said. “The bar is raised because [of Victor].”
Warren added that she was saddened by the fact that Victor McElhaney could no longer tell his own story.
“[People] spend their lives telling a story, and when they pass, they no longer get to tell that story,” Warren said. “It’s up to the people around them to tell that story for them. Although we can tell that story in our own unique ways and how Vic has affected all of us, nobody can tell it as beautifully as him. I’m asking for justice for my friend. I’m asking for some sort of peace for his family.”
To provide information about the suspects, contact authorities at the Homicide Special Section at 213-486-6890. To leave anonymous tips, call 213-486-6890 or go to www.lacrimestoppers.org.

The gloomy morning weather was overshadowed by the buzz of excitement from over 19,000 graduates as they held up USC’s “Fight On” sign one last time at the 136th Commencement Ceremony Friday.
Interim President Wanda Austin, valedictorian Ivana Giang and commencement speaker Karen Bass delivered remarks to the graduates and attendees at the main ceremony.
Following a procession of faculty, flags and half-century Trojan alumni, Austin opened the event by acknowledging the graduates’ achievements in their respective fields and offering words of encouragement to the new class of alumni.
“Today we have gathered at a very important moment for our University, our nation and our world,” Austin said. “The graduates we celebrate today exemplify the very, very best of a new generation. You are one of the most advanced, the most talented and the most creative in the nation.”
Austin noted that this year’s commencement ceremony was particularly special for the Kaufman School of Dance, which celebrated its first graduating class.
Bass, a USC alumna and congresswoman representing the University Park neighborhood, began her keynote address with a humorous anecdote about politician and USC alumnus Frederick Madison Roberts. The first black man elected to the California State Assembly, Madison most notably signed a bill that established UCLA.
“The piece of legislation he is probably best remembered for is the bill that established that school on the other side of town,” Bass said. “So, when you encounter someone from that other school, you remind them that their school only exists because a Trojan made it happen.”
On a more serious note, Bass called on graduates to be agents for change, listing acclaimed members of the Trojan Family like astronaut Neil Armstrong and actress Regina King.
“All of these individuals grew up in vastly different times and came from widely diverse backgrounds, but they had two important things in common: They graduated USC, and they dreamed,” Bass said. “Now, it’s your turn to dream.”
Bass was among one of the honorary degree recipients alongside Spirit of Troy director Arthur C. Bartner; dancer and actor Mikhail Baryshnikov; philanthropists and art patrons Eli and Edythe Broad; statistician and neuroscientist Emery Brown; and humanitarian Cindy Hensley McCain.
During the ceremony, Giang delivered her valedictory address to the class of 2019.
Giang, who received two bachelor’s degrees in public policy and global studies, urged her fellow graduates to be passionate, and to fight for equal access and opportunity for those in marginalized communities.
“Here at USC, we’ve been told to ‘Fight On’ all these years,” Giang said. “But I have to ask USC, ‘What are we fighting for?’ I fought alongside my friends to make underrepresented student voices heard because I believe in USC.”
Giang also addressed the scandals that have roiled the campus community for the past two years.
“There is a moral responsibility to protect the right for everyone to experience what is beautiful in this world,” Giang said. “Given all that’s happened here this year, I think it’s time our campus leaders take a lesson from us students about how to truly live by a set of values.”
Giang thanked her parents, who came to the United States as Vietnam War immigrants, as well as her fellow graduates for all they have done for her. In concluding her address, she called on the Class of 2019 to come together.
“To my fellow graduates, can we all make a promise to spread a little more love wherever we go from here?” Giang said. “Can we share some of the beauty we felt here together? I know we have it in us.”
In a special announcement at the end of the ceremony, Board of Trustees Chairman Rick Caruso bestowed an honorary degree upon Austin for leading the University during one of the most challenging times in its 140-year history.
“As interim president, Dr. Austin has led this university with courage, dignity and grace,” Caruso said. “Never once did she avoid making hard decisions. Dr. Austin listened, she learned, she engaged, she led.”

The USC women’s track and field team captured its second consecutive Pac-12 title Sunday while the men’s team placed fifth overall at the Pac-12 Championship in Tuscon, Ariz. 
The Women of Troy surged to victory with the help of strong efforts from their relay teams. Meanwhile on the men’s side, junior distance runner Isaiah Jewett and sophomores jumper Earnest Sears III and hurdler Cameron Samuel put up impressive individual performances. 
In the women’s 4x100m relay, redshirt junior Angie Annelus, freshman Lanae-Tava Thomas and sophomores TeeTee Terry and Chanel Brissett stepped up to the starting blocks for the Trojans. Brissett got USC off to an early lead on the first leg of the race. The Trojans retained their lead for the entire race, and Terry finished the relay for USC well ahead of the rest of the pack. The team’s time of 42.45 seconds won the event for the Trojans for the 13th time since 2000. The time was also the second-fastest relay time in the world this year, only behind the 42.44 record the Trojans set the previous day at the preliminaries. 
USC’s women placed 1-2-3 in the 100m hurdles. Brissett jumped to an early lead and never let it go, becoming the Pac-12 100m hurdles champion once again with a personal record of 12.70. The time was .02 seconds shy of the stadium record and moved Brissett to second on USC’s all-time 100m hurdles list. The time was also the fourth-fastest in the world this season. Brissett’s teammates, juniors Anna Cockrell and Mecca McGlaston, placed second and third in the event, earning the Trojans 24 points. 
USC then earned 22 points in the 400m dash. Sophomore Kaelin Roberts placed first in the race with a time of 51.25. The time was a personal best for Roberts and was good for third place on USC’s all-time list. Junior Kyra Constantine and freshman Bailey Lear both posted personal bests and placed second and fifth, respectively. 
In the 400m hurdles, Cockrell earned her second consecutive Pac-12 title with a time of 56.46. Her performance earned USC 10 more points and extended its lead over Oregon to 18 points.
In the women’s 200m dash, Annelus, Thomas, Terry and McGlaston effectively put the competition away by placing first, second, third and sixth, respectively. Annelus’s time of 22.71 was a season best and Thomas’s second-place time of 22.91 was a personal record. Following this race, the Trojans led the Ducks 136-96.
Lear, Cockrell, Constantine and Roberts put an exclamation point on the Trojans’ championship performance by winning the women’s 4×400 relay with a season best time of 3:29:23. The time moved the women to ninth on USC’s all-time list and earned the Trojans 10 points. USC’s women’s team finished with 154 points, outpacing Oregon by 17. 
On the men’s side, Sears III became a repeat champion in the men’s high jump. He cleared a personal record of 7-5.25 (2.27 meters) which moved him into third place on USC’s all-time list and seventh in the world this year. Jewett won the men’s 800m race with a time of 1:49.25 and Samuel won the men’s 400m hurdles title with a personal record of 49.09 seconds. The time moved Samuel up to seventh on USC’s all-time list and was also the seventh fastest time in the world this year.
Samuel and Jewett teamed up with freshmen Ayden Owens and Noah Green in the men’s 4×400 relay. The group posted a time of 3:05.73, winning the race and tallying up the Trojan’s final 10 points of the day, good for fifth in the men’s team competition.
Despite the program’s success, USC’s track and field director Caryl Smith Gilbert saw room for improvement. 
“We have some sharpening up to do. It was finals this past week and graduation, so we are a little tired and rusty, but we will be ready in two weeks for what we have left to come,” Gilbert said in an interview with USC Athletics. “It was a great, exciting weekend and I look forward to seeing what else we can do.”
Both teams now look ahead to the NCAA West Preliminary Championships in Sacramento. The three-day meet begins May 23. Nationals will take place June 5 in Austin, Texas.

USC visited Arizona over the weekend, losing twice before inclement weather canceled the finale of the scheduled three-game set. 
On Friday, the Trojans dropped a lopsided 12-4 matchup to the Wildcats. In a sign of things to come, the evening began when the first three Trojans struck out in the top of the first inning. 
Arizona put up 5 runs in the first against the Trojans’ junior right-handed pitcher Connor Lunn. With the help of an error to start the frame, a walk and five hits — including back-to-back home runs — the Wildcats set the tone for the rest of the night. After junior third baseman Nick Quintana hit a 3 run homer, freshman second baseman Dayton Dooney followed with a solo shot of his own. Five runners crossed home before Lunn recorded a single out.
The teams traded runs in the third inning, and USC cut the lead to 6-2 after a fourth-inning RBI fielder’s choice by sophomore shortstop Ben Ramirez scored junior center fielder Matthew Acosta. 
From there, Arizona took off. An RBI double and single in the fourth inning pushed the Wildcats’ lead to 6 runs. After junior infielder Cameron Cannon’s solo homer and two RBI singles, a wild pitch put the Wildcats up 12-2 in the sixth inning. 
The Trojans’ junior right fielder Brady Shockey scored on an error in the seventh, and freshman first baseman Clay Owens doubled home redshirt junior catcher CJ Stubbs in the eighth. But the runs were too little, too late as the Trojans went down quietly in the ninth to lose the first game.
Lunn has been one of USC’s best starting pitchers all season, but Friday was not his night. He surrendered 8 runs (7 earned) on nine hits through 3.2 innings. 
Junior left-hander Austin Manning relieved Lunn, and did not find much more success, allowing 4 earned runs on seven hits through two innings. Sophomore left-hander Augie Sylk provided the only bright spot on the mound for USC, holding the Wildcats scoreless through two no-hit innings. 
Owens was the only Trojan with multiple hits, as USC tallied just five for the game.
On Saturday, the Trojans lost again by a more competitive score of 8-5. 
In the bottom of the first inning, the Wildcats jumped out to an early 1-0 lead on an error by Ramirez. USC quickly erased the lead when freshman third baseman Emilio Rosas cranked his first career home run, a 3-run shot for a 3-1 second inning lead. 
The game entered a weather delay in the middle of the second, and the contest was postponed until Sunday. 
The two teams picked up where they left off, and the Trojans seemed to lose all the momentum they had the night before. Arizona tied the game at 3 runs in the third inning on a 2-run homer by freshman right fielder Ryan Holgate, and tacked on three more in the fourth, highlighted by a Quintana RBI double, for a 6-3 lead. 
Stubbs’ solo homer in the fifth (his sixth home run of the season) cut the deficit to 2 runs. A Wildcat sacrifice fly in the sixth again pushed their lead to 3 runs, and the Wildcats answered senior infielder Brandon Perez’s RBI single with a run-scoring double of their own in the eighth.
The 8-5 score held when Shockey, representing the tying run, grounded into a game-ending double play in the ninth. 
A trio of sophomores handled pitching duties for USC. Sophomore left-hander Isaac Esqueda started on the mound, lasting only 1.2 innings due to the game’s postponement. He allowed 1 run four. Sophomore right-hander Kyle Hurt took the loss, surrendering 5 earned runs through four innings. Sophomore left-hander John Beller finished the game with 2.1 innings of 1-run ball for the Trojans. 
Perez, junior outfielder Blake Sabol and sophomore designated hitter Trevor Halsema each collected two hits for USC, part of their 10-hit attack. 
After Saturday’s game was postponed, Sunday was scheduled to be a doubleheader, but the latter game was canceled again due to weather. The Trojans left Arizona after the shortened two-game series. 
USC will visit Loyola Marymount on Tuesday for one game against the Lions, who are 28-20 on the season pending Monday’s result. LMU won a 14-5 matchup against the Trojans in early March. 
After LMU, Oregon will come to town for a three-game set at Dedeaux Field. Entering play on Tuesday, the Ducks are 25-24 on the season, and have not yet faced the Trojans in 2019.
Tuesday’s and Friday’s games begin at 6 p.m., Saturday’s at 1 p.m., and first pitch for Sunday’s series finale is scheduled for noon.

Last month, The Criterion Collection — a company that, according to its mission statement, is “dedicated to publishing important classic and contemporary films” — launched its own streaming service. Head over to the Criterion Channel, and you’re greeted with the words “A Movie Lover’s Dream” emblazoned on a beautiful, indigo-filtered snapshot of Kirsten Dunst in “The Virgin Suicides,” well, dreaming. The Channel is publicized as the film buff’s playground, a stronghold of arthouse cinema bursting with films you likely won’t find anywhere else these days. 
That’s because our moviegoing culture is changing, quickly, not just because we see movies differently, but because movies see us differently too. 
Especially in the U.S., viewers are considered consumers who must be entertained, not critics who must be informed. Even though movies lend us both entertainment and literature, they are now emphasizing the former quality over the latter. It’s quantity over quality now — capitalism is seeping into our cinemas.
Such consumerist thinking actually pushes us out of the theaters. With streaming services incessantly competing for the attention of their subscribers, going to the movies is too pricey an alternative. Daily dumping truckloads of content into our devices, these sites will do anything short of selling their souls to keep us hooked. Watching a lot of movies can be a good thing, of course, but not when supply zooms past demand — that makes movie audiences what they were never meant to be: passive. 
The Criterion Channel is a haven in a content desert. It stepped onto the scene with an arsenal of pre-selected films — mostly foreign, 20th century arthouse — already in The Criterion collection. Unlike Netflix, The Criterion Channel is curated in line with one mission: to familiarize audiences with important filmmakers. Indeed, everyone with a title in the channel is a significant contributor to modern films, blockbuster or indie. You’ll find the likes of American surrealist David Lynch, Italian visionary Federico Fellini, master of suspense Alfred Hitchcock and comedy royal Charlie Chaplin — artists whose names double as adjectives that describe their signature cinematic flourishes. 
Daunting as they may seem, black-and-white foreign arthouse movies do not reside in some elite echelon of culture reserved for the thinking man. They are for everyone — and Criterion is emphasizing the need for more people to appreciate these films. 
Netflix is not the bad guy — of course, it contains great movies Criterion would never select — but its business model (which will inevitably remain the norm for years to come) is training us to see movies as just something to have in the background, a second screen to provide light entertainment as we attempt to multitask. The surplus of streamable films is a double-edged sword: It’s good to give more people the opportunity to tell their story for millions of subscribers, but it’s not good that streaming sites want us to quickly queue up the next thing. As our Netflix watchlists clutter up, we feel like we have to watch everything. So we try to, while not giving each individual story the attention it actually deserves. 
Criterion means to promote those films that took the medium forward even as they built on the foundation of the past. Its strong lineup — equipped with special features for almost every film — educates the common viewer and film student alike, training them not to be passive viewers but to dissect why each film is deemed important. Without the Criterion Channel, some of the best stories ever told would have no home.

As podcasts have grown in popularity, they have also provided a new marketing opportunity for tech companies and international megabrands to create audio content that will draw even more people to their products. But while Facebook’s “Three and a Half Degrees” or McDonalds’ “The Sauce” might seem like little more than extended advertisements, some brands have found a way to make their podcasts engaging and original while plugging their products. 
Inside Trader Joe’s
As whimsical as the grocery store chain that it came from, “Inside Trader Joe’s” takes listeners behind the scenes with stories about the chain’s founding, where their most beloved products originated and the carefully curated branding the grocery store has cultivated. 
The show is hosted by marketing director Tara Miller and vice president of Product Marketing Matt Sloan. The first season focused on the history of Trader Joe’s, featuring interviews with founder Joe Coulombe himself, and more recent episodes take listeners behind the scenes of the store’s various sections — there’s a “We’re Nuts About Wine And Cheese” episode and an episode called “Frozen. The Foods.” 
The podcast has the same earnest dash of humor that makes the Fearless Flyer (Trader Joe’s newspaper-esque product catalog) as beloved as Trader Joe’s products themselves to devoted patrons. It also doesn’t shy away from high production: An episode about how Trader Joe’s discovers new products brings listeners to a factory in France complete with sounds of machinery and people rapidly speaking French in the background. 
The hosts embody the company’s employees in the best way — they’re passionate about their jobs bringing bubbly voices to the show that perfectly reflect the store’s approachable branding. A couple episodes in, listeners will feel like they are at the local Trader Joe’s with the hosts, complete with the chain’s trademark Hawaiian shirts. 

In Your Dreams
Mattress company Casper might be best known for its blanket advertising on many podcasts in the earlier days of the medium, so it should come as no surprise that the brand had its own podcast. 
Comedian Chris Gethard hosted the show, bringing not only his humor but also his experience hosting the interview podcast “Beautiful Stories from Anonymous People.” He was joined by self-proclaimed dream analysis expert Gary Richardson, who picked apart dreams submitted by listeners and a comedian guest on each episode. 
The show was sparsely produced and felt amateurish, which only added to its comedic appeal. Casper gave Gethard free rein to make the podcast however he wanted it, and this carte blanche yielded in a series of hijinks and jokes peppered throughout the dream analysis premise. 
The guests — including former “Saturday Night Live” cast member Bobby Moynihan and “The Tick” star Griffin Newman — bolstered the podcast’s hilarity, offering their own hyperbolic sleep experiences for Richardson’s questionable-at-best analysis. 
Despite the improvisational feel that Gethard cultivated, he also managed to develop a narrative storyline that carried through all nine episodes of the show. “In Your Dreams” managed to recreate the imperfect, internet-blogger feel of early podcasts while delivering humorous and captivating content at the same time. 

You Can’t Make This Up
Netflix has proven to be a master at branded podcasting, with eight podcasts to its name available on Apple Podcasts, including “Strong Black Legends,” a weekly interview show featuring black Hollywood stars, and “I’m Obsessed With This,” which features entertainment critics discussing Netflix content they can’t stop binging. 
But one of its best offerings is “You Can’t Make This Up,” a companion podcast that goes behind the scenes of Netflix’s true crime documentaries. It tells the stories of how a national platform can affect the lives of real people in documentaries, how filmmakers make decisions about telling a true story and gives listeners an exclusive look at content that didn’t end up making it onto the documentary. 
The podcast’s success is largely due to Netflix’s large library of well-produced narrative documentary series, like the Emmy-winning “Wild Wild Country” and “Making a Murderer,” which gained national notoriety upon its release in 2016.
Most episodes of the podcast are based on interviews with the directors behind the documentaries, hosted by a rotating cast of journalists, podcast hosts and comedians, including NPR’s Kelly McEvers and comedian Michael Ian Black.
While every episode is fascinating, one humorous highlight is the “American Vandal” interview — the Netflix mockumentary’s “directors” Peter Maldonado and Sam Ecklund talk about the central criminal of their show’s second season: “The Turd Burglar.” 

DTR
You probably know Tinder for its hookup culture reputation — and not for its award-winning branded podcast, “DTR” (the show won Best Branded Podcast at the iHeartRadio Podcast Awards in 2019). 
Host Jane Marie, a “This American Life” veteran, brings a public radio curiosity to the world of dating in the digital age. Episodes in the first season focus on the small, often overthought aspects of online dating — how to craft the perfect first message, what pictures make a profile appealing, etc. 
The writing is quick-witted, and the captivating anecdotes are full of advice for using the app effectively. Living up to its brand, Tinder isn’t afraid to delve into the explicit — an entire episode is devoted to dick pics and open discussions of sex. 
The second season has a different approach — on each show, Marie and a comedian guest (episodes have featured Patti Harrison and Aparna Nancherla) take over a random Tinder user’s profile: They swipe for them, engage conversations and send people on dates. Because the stakes are non-existent for the listener, making matches and engaging in online dating becomes a whole lot more fun as the hosts provide commentary that’s both entertaining and offers sage advice for the average Tinder user. 
The podcast not only enhances the experience of using Tinder and similar dating apps but also provides an amusing look into the complex world of online relationships.

The Dworak-Peck School of Social Work was the subject of a Los Angeles Times story last week that uncovered major financial issues at the school that may cause the school to lay off almost half of its staff. 
The budgetary concerns arose during the tenure of former dean Marilyn Flynn, who stepped down last year as another alleged bribery scheme at USC was being uncovered: a $100,000 donation made to a nonprofit controlled by a local politician’s son through the social work school. 
While the school’s budget issue might seem unrelated to the host of other sexual assault, bribery and misconduct cases the University is facing, it’s reflective of the administrative culture cultivated under former USC President C. L. Max Nikias and Provost Michael Quick that allowed for such issues to go unchecked.
After Nikias stepped down as president, the Times reported in a profile of him that his tenure marked a shift in how administrative decisions were made. He and Quick increased the responsibility of deans and faculty in their individual units within the University, creating a “federated system” that allowed for little limits on the self-governance of every school and department within USC. 
The Times’ recent report said that after Flynn’s departure, University officials discovered the Dworak-Peck school had been losing money for years, and that it had lowered admissions standards in an attempt to create more tuition revenue.  
But University officials shouldn’t have found this out after the former dean left. They should’ve known about these issues from their start. They should’ve seen the warning signs — a budget that was dipping into reserve accounts to keep the school afloat and a national ranking that dropped from No. 12 to No. 25 in just two years, according to the U.S. News and World Report. 
It’s easy for USC to blame these issues on Flynn — already having been ousted from the University, she’s the natural scapegoat. But the real blame lies in the “federated system.” With little oversight, Nikias and Quick didn’t care to ensure that Flynn was running her school properly. Administrators at USC often claim that they had no knowledge of the many alleged scandals the University has faced, but in reality, they chose not to know. 
It seems ironic, because a University administration’s job, first and foremost, should be to ensure its schools are running smoothly — to ensure that students are provided a valuable learning experience at USC. In creating their “federated system,” Nikias and Quick shirked one of their most important responsibilities.
So, it comes as no surprise that Dworak-Peck, the Keck School of Medicine, the Roski School of Art and Design and USC Admission (among other University departments) all saw unchecked misconduct or structural issues during Nikias’ administration. 
2019, however, marks the start of a new era for USC. Nikias, Quick, Vice President for Student Affairs Ainsley Carry and a number of other Nikias-era administrators have left or are leaving the University. President-elect Carol Folt is set to lead the University when she officially starts on July 1, and her administration will include new positions such as a vice president for human resources and a chief communications officer. 
The University’s newest leaders all come from outside of USC — they have a chance to bring a new perspective to the University and upend the floundering administrative culture Nikias built. 
Folt must recognize that as president, she not only has to clean up the messes Nikias made, but also establish a system of oversight that will ensure issues like those at the Dworak-Peck school don’t continue to haunt the University. Folt’s new administration must take a hands-on approach to leading USC. By taking on a more involved role, Folt can restore the University’s reputation and re-establish credibility among disillusioned students, faculty and alumni. 
USC is in a state of disarray because of Nikias. If Folt truly wants to change that, she must learn from and correct his errors — and that ultimately means serving USC’s students and faculty first.

With 2020 presidential campaigns in full swing, this has to be the election year that millennial and, in particular, college-aged voters, get off the sidelines.  Not only do we all have a moral obligation to vote with so many fundamental human rights at stake, but we also have a critical, personal interest in doing so. 
Student loan debt and college affordability are two of the most pressing issues our generation faces. Both of these — debt and lack of access to higher education institutions like USC — snowball into long-term economic disasters: a limited job market, a limited housing market and intergenerational economic disenfranchisement.
The 2020 presidential election offers a meaningful chance at change, to ensure that the students of today and the future can attend college without facing steep economic consequences. The harsh realities of our education system have rendered many opportunities to be accessible almost solely on the basis of wealth and economic status, as demonstrated by USC’s involvement in the nationwide college admission bribery case. And those who are only able to attend college through loans could soon face a ruthless, predatory student debt system without bold policy reforms.
Data in 2015 showed there was $1.2 trillion of outstanding student loan debt in the U.S. As of last year, outstanding student loan debt increased to $1.5 trillion, affecting 44 million borrowers each with an average outstanding loan balance of $37,172.
College accessibility, of course, is a deeper and more nuanced issue than tuition and universities’ sticker prices. From the costs of standardized testing preparation to extracurricular activities to college counseling, access to higher education is influenced by many more economic factors. 
Making higher education accessible to all without crippling debt will require long-term, systemic change and meaningful reforms to address economic inequity, at large. But lowering the costs of college to prevent debt and widen access, while establishing policies to forgive existing debt, are a strong starting point.
Democratic presidential candidate and Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren currently leads the field with the boldest and most thorough plan to bolster college accessibility. Her plan would cancel all student loan debt and establish tuition-free public college. Her proposal would cancel up to $50,000 in student loan debt for 42 million Americans. The plan is supported by her previously released tax plan to establish a tax on the 75,000 wealthiest families in America. 
Hopefully, other presidential candidates will follow her lead in fighting for college debt forgiveness and affordability as priorities in the Democratic Party agenda. A future without bold and urgent action on higher education is a dark one for ours and future generations. 
College degrees have become largely essential to accessing good-paying jobs, yet paradoxically, college degrees have also become exponentially more inaccessible to many families, over the last few decades. There has never been a more urgent — or possible — time to address this crisis.
And it seems addressing this crisis could largely fall on the shoulders of those it impacts most. Voter turnout among college-aged, millennials saw positive improvements in the 2018 midterm elections, but has historically been and remains frustratingly abysmal. Hopefully, with a number of meaningful proposals for solutions to this crisis on the table, these polling numbers will change — and with them, an alarming culture of debt and college inaccessibility.

After countless weeks of drama, rumors and even a fan-orchestrated protest outside Staples Center, the Los Angeles Lakers have found their head coach. Frank Vogel will now be in charge of facilitating a winning product on the court–and helping to figure out how in the world to repair the organization’s broken reputation off it.
Along with Vogel, 10-time NBA All-Star and Lebron James’ former Olympic teammate Jason Kidd will serve in a particularly prominent role as the team’s assistant coach. Both Vogel and Kidd have had previous stints as head coaches with NBA franchises.
The hires come on the heels of several tumultuous weeks in Lakerland. Things began to unravel on April 9 when Magic Johnson stepped down from an administrative role in an unprofessional, seemingly impromptu press conference before the team’s final game of the season. 
Johnson cited his sibling-like relationship with the Lakers’ controlling owner Jeanie Buss as the reason for his sudden departure.
“[Jeanie] gave me full power to do what I wanted to do,” Johnson said. “But I want to always preserve our relationship [and] tomorrow I would have to affect [Walton’s] livelihood and [his] life, and that’s not fun for me.”
Johnson’s resignation was shocking — and in all honesty, the way in which he did it was extremely childish. But make no mistake: it was for the best. 
Team presidents must be in the trenches around the clock with their staff in terms of scouting, daily accessibility and general franchise management. 
Johnson, a Los Angeles icon and esteemed businessman with dozens of interests outside of the Lakers organization, was not the right fit for such a role. 
In his absence, the Lakers were left with a front office power vacuum which is yet to be officially filled. This raised many concerns as the franchise searched for its next head coach. Shortly after the end of the Lakers’ season, it was rumored that Philadelphia 76ers assistant coach Monty Williams and former Cleveland Cavaliers head coach Tyronn Lue were the top candidates for the job. 
Williams has since agreed to coach the Phoenix Suns. Lue reportedly turned down a three-year offer from the Lakers, feeling that a five-year deal would have been appropriate considering his championship resume.
The turbulence in the head coaching position is nothing new for the Lakers. Vogel is the sixth head coach for the Lakers since the retirement of Hall of Fame coach Phil Jackson in 2011. 
While Vogel — whose tenure with the Indiana Pacers included two Eastern Conference Finals appearances — is now officially the head coach, it remains unclear where the decision-making power in the front office lies, and many questions remain unanswered.
Kidd’s hiring, at the very least, was controversial. 
In 2001, he pleaded guilty to spousal abuse. In 2012, he was arrested for driving while intoxicated, and in 2014, he received criticism for pursuing the Milwaukee Bucks head coaching position while he was still serving as coach of the Brooklyn Nets. His history as a coach and his evident eagerness to lobby for a fellow coach’s job will likely add yet another layer of drama to the ongoing Laker saga in the coming seasons. 
Kidd’s prominent role in the organization also creates the perception that Vogel, before even coaching a game for the Lakers, is already on the hot seat.
If the team’s goal is to win multiple NBA championships in its last three season with LeBron James, the Lakers organization must demonstrate a higher level of cohesion and stability from the top of the front office to the end of the bench – values they’ve been lacking recently. 
The unfilled power vacuum left by Johnson along with Kidd’s controversial hiring will be a hindrance for the team. 
This offseason, possibly more than ever before, all eyes in the NBA world will be focused on the Lakers.

In a rematch of last year’s championship game, Stanford exacted revenge on the Trojans, coming away with a narrow 9-8 win over the defending champions.
As time expired, a blast from USC’s junior utility Maud Megens ricocheted off the post; the narrow miss sealed Stanford’s seventh NCAA championship victory. 
Sunday’s title match was a close contest from the start. Each time one team netted a goal, the other had an answer. The largest lead of the game was of just 2 goals, held by the Trojans in the third quarter. However, Stanford tied it up at 8 to head into the final frame.
The Trojans entered the fourth quarter without sophomore driver Paige Hauschild, who fouled out on an exclusion penalty at the end of the third. As Mountain Pacific Sports Federation Tournament MVP and the team’s second-leading scorer of the regular season, Hauschild was an important asset for the Trojans against stiff competition this season.
“Of course [we had] to adjust,” interim head coach Casey Moon said of Hauschild’s ejection. “[Hauschild] is probably one of the best players in the country, she’s going to be an Olympian one day, and she’s the focal point of our team, our offense and our defense. You have to learn to adjust and we did. We fought until the end and we were right there.”
The Cardinal scored the winning goal with just under five minutes left on the clock. From there, both teams cracked down defensively. USC’s senior goalie Amanda Longan had two saves in the final minute, giving the Trojans one last breath. However, the Trojan offense could not find the back of the net as Stanford held on to the 9-8 lead.
Despite the championship loss, the youthful Trojan squad demonstrated its promising talent and resiliency during both the NCAA tournament and season. This was the program’s first trip to the NCAA tournament without former head coach Jovan Vavic, who was terminated during the regular season due to his alleged involvement in the admissions bribery scheme.
“We’ve gone through a lot of adversity this season, not expected and not exciting, but we’ve done an amazing job overcoming that,” junior driver Kelsey McIntosh said. “A lot of people probably thought it was going to ruin our season and we were going to go downhill, but I’m so proud of how we overcame that and got so much closer, had so much more fight in us.”
Despite Vavic’s departure, the Trojans compiled a 23-1 regular season record, earned the No. 1 seed in the NCAA tournament, and ended as runners-up.
“I was gifted an incredible team,” Moon said. “These girls, I tell you, can coach themselves. I say that I have the fun job because I get to call the plays. But these girls play themselves, coach themselves, and it’s a testament to their character, their discipline, and their hard work.”
In the team’s 10-8 overtime win in the semifinal match against Cal, all five freshmen punched in at least 1 goal for the Trojans. The contributions of these young players are promising for a team with the same goal year after year: to win the national championship.
“Our girls are truly, truly special, so resilient, and they truly fight until the end,” Moon said. “I’m so proud of that. I’m so proud to be called ‘head coach’ for the team that I was gifted.”

Former USC women’s assistant soccer coach Laura Janke pleaded guilty to a racketeering conspiracy charge Tuesday. Janke created fake athletic profiles to admit the students of wealthy parents who bribed her and other University officials as part of the college admissions bribery scheme.
In addition to Janke, several USC parents involved in the college admissions scheme also pleaded guilty. Los Angeles businessman Devin Sloane pleaded guilty Monday to paying $250,000 in bribes to admit his son to USC as a water polo player, despite the fact that his son never played the sport. Davina and Bruce Isackson, the president of a real estate firm in the Bay Area, pleaded guilty last month to getting their daughters into UCLA and USC through bribes.
Sloane and the Isacksons are among 14 parents who pleaded guilty to their involvement in the college admissions bribery scheme, code-named “Operation Varsity Blues” by the FBI. 
Janke conspired with college admissions consultant William “Rick” Singer, the scheme’s mastermind, who has pleaded guilty to four felonies. While working at USC from 2007 to 2014, Janke created false awards for prospective students’ admission profiles and altered images to make the students appear as athletes.
Janke agreed to cooperate with the federal investigation into the scandal in April, the Daily Trojan reported.
In addition to pleading guilty, Janke entered into a formal cooperation agreement April 21, in hopes of receiving a more lenient sentence by providing information which could help prosecutors’ investigations, according to the Los Angeles Times.
Janke’s plea agreement includes a sentence for up to approximately three years in prison, according to the Los Angeles Times. Her sentence could be reduced if the information she provides prosecutors helps the investigation.
Janke will be sentenced Oct. 17.
