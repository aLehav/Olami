USC agreed to a $215-million settlement for a class action lawsuit brought by victims of former campus gynecologist George Tyndall on Friday, according to a letter from Interim President Wanda Austin. The settlement addresses the federal class action lawsuit brought against USC, but not state court claims. 
The proposed settlement will provide all members of the class action — former patients of Tyndall — with a minimum compensation of $2,500, and individuals willing to disclose additional details can receive up to $250,000, the letter stated. 
“I hope that [this settlement] provides a sense of being heard and a sense of progress,” Austin said in an interview with the Daily Trojan and USC Annenberg Media Friday. “I hope that [the victims] see in this action a commitment to address individually and as a group that we are very concerned and want to make sure that they get the very best of care anywhere in our community.”
While an agreement on USC’s settlement has been reached, it has not been filed in federal court yet, according to a University spokesperson. 
“Former patients who already have state court claims pending can of course continue to pursue those,” said University counsel Tara Lee. “The federal class action settlement proposal has a tiered settlement structure within it, so that individuals who had different experiences can go through a [different settlement] process.”
Austin wrote that the Board of Trustees supports the settlement, which was reached in collaboration with the plaintiffs’ counsel.
Patients who underwent gynecological examinations by Tyndall will receive compensation of $2,500 with no requests of further information about the patients’ experience. Those who submit a written claim about their experiences with Tyndall may receive an additional compensation of $7,500 to $20,000. Patients who agree to a private interview with a licensed psychologist can receive additional compensation of $7,500 to $250,000. 
A court-approved independent official will review claims to determine payments. 
“We think that we have been able to negotiate for a substantial amount of money for these women,” said Annika Martin, who represents multiple victims and helped reach the settlement with USC. “No money can truly compensate victims of these kinds of horrible acts.”
Along with the $215-million settlement, Martin said that the agreement also ensures USC will implement new policies to establish protocol during examinations. The agreement will also include ways to properly report inappropriate behavior safely and confidentially, according to Martin.
“With any class action settlement, [attorneys] have the option to opt out of the settlement and to continue their individual litigation [in state court],” Martin said. “But, we hope that they would read the settlement agreement and make a decision based on that, whether they want to pursue it or not.”
Some attorneys who are serving as counsel for the state class action against USC have expressed frustration with the settlement. Claims filed in state court were not addressed in the settlement. 
Attorney Gloria Allred called the federal settlement “a nuisance amount” that will not properly compensate victims for their suffering.
“We are continuing to vigorously litigate our state cases for numerous victims, and we will insist that each of our clients be properly compensated for what they were forced to endure which for many of our clients is expected to be far in excess of what individuals in the class action will receive,” Allred wrote in an email to the Daily Trojan.
Mike Arias, who represents over 80 victims in state cases, said the settlement was unsupported in reasoning. He said that Board of Trustees Chairman Rick Caruso’s goal of reaching a settlement quickly and effectively does not benefit the victims and instead keeps them quiet.
“The first settlement is an attempt to try to limit the rights of many of these women victims,” Arias said. “I’m very disappointed because I thought … that they were going to do it promptly and look for change for proper solutions, but without all the information necessary to evaluate that … nothing is really happening.”
Attorney Andy Rubenstein said the proposed settlement doesn’t hold the University accountable for its actions and that the lack of institutional change will only allow more abuse to happen in the future. 
“The proposed settlement announced today from USC is laughable,” Rubenstein wrote in a statement to the Daily Trojan. “To come to this agreement before a single document was produced or a deposition was taken, is an insult to the survivors of Dr. Tyndall, many of whom have suffered in silence for decades.”
In a separate letter to the USC community on Friday, Caruso wrote that the University is still undergoing its independent investigation of Engemann Student Health Center. He explained that the next months will focus on the presidential search, and the Special Committee on Governance Reform will continue to examine the Board’s operations to better engage the USC community.
“My fellow Trustees and I also pledged to ensure a cultural shift within the University that places the safety of students and patients as our top priority,” he wrote. 
Both Caruso and Austin’s letters referred to a summary of University actions taken since  sexual abuse allegations against Tyndall broke out mid-May, which primarily focused on Engemann. 
All student health care providers are now hired through the Keck School of Medicine, which conducts an extensive background check for new hires. Along with an online reporting mechanism for health care providers, USC created an Office of Professionalism and Ethics for “complaint monitoring and investigation.”
USC also said it plans to adopt new measures to advise senior leadership and redraft the University’s Code of Ethics, along with hiring a new senior vice president of human resources.

Attorney John Manly, who represents several women who have filed complaints against former gynecologist George Tyndall, spoke at a press conference Thursday. (Sasha Urban | Daily Trojan)
Attorneys representing more than 250 victims of former USC gynecologist George Tyndall held a press conference Thursday at the Radisson Hotel, after filing 93 additional lawsuits against the University. More than 15 of Tyndall’s accusers attended, calling on California Attorney General Xavier Becerra to investigate the University. 
The U.S. Department of Education opened a Title IX investigation into the University’s handling of allegations of abuse against Tyndall in June. The lawsuits allege that USC ignored complaints about Tyndall and knowingly concealed his actions throughout his time at the Engemann Student Health Center.
John Manly and Andy Rubenstein, the attorneys representing the accusers, were present at the conference. Rachael Denhollander and Sarah Klein, who were victims of former sports physician Larry Nassar’s sexual abuse at Michigan State University, also voiced their support for a state investigation. 
“To the Attorney General of California, do it better this time,” Denhollander said. “Open an independent investigation into what went on at USC even faster than the attorney general in Michigan did.” 
Eleven women spoke about their experiences with Tyndall, and many testified that Tyndall photographed them naked in his office. 
“I couldn’t believe it when I found out that the LAPD has boxes of photos of our vaginas,” said Audrey Nafziger, a graduate of the Gould School of Law. “It’s absolutely disgusting, and it’s absolutely what a predator does. [Tyndall] keeps trophies.” 
One victim, who introduced herself as Sarah,  said she called to find out if the University was holding those photos. She said the experience was “chilling and shocking.”
“To this day, they’ve never followed up on my inquiry,” Sarah said. 
The women and their attorneys also called on USC to break its silence and listen to the nearly 500 accusers. 
“USC is treating these women as their adversary …” Manly said.  “These women are not your adversaries, they’re your best friends. It’s like they came home to their mother and tried to tell her about their abuse, and their mother shut the door in their face and threw rocks to get them off the lawn.” 
Dana Loewy, a former USC student and victim, said she wants the Board of Trustees to change, and that she thinks it is ridiculous the members of its executive committee are kept a secret. 
“When, USC, are you going to respond?” said Brennan Heil, a senior majoring in communication. “When are you going to start setting an example for every other university in the country, who I almost guarantee you has the same exact issue?”
Many women spoke about how proud they are to be Trojans, and how excited they were to come to USC as young women. Shernae Hughes, who graduated last May, said she was elated to be the first in her family to attend college, especially one that promised diversity and a commitment to its students’ well-being. 
But the reality she discovered was very different. Hughes said Tyndall made numerous racist and sexist remarks to her about black women’s fertility and sexuality.
“I am well aware of the interlocking oppressions of racism and sexism, and it is unfortunate that I have had to experience these effects as a student at the university that I called home,” Hughes said.
Manly said the survivors are calling on Becerra to launch an independent investigation because the University receives taxpayer money. He said that USC’s independent  investigation under O’Melveny & Myers LLP, a law firm retained by Chairman Rick Caruso, is insufficient. 
 “I know who I am as a woman, as a mother, so I am all in to see this through and to tell my story, despite what anyone may say,” said alumna Amanda Davis. “I am hopeful that USC knows what’s at stake here.”

Professor Michael Messner was inspired by his grandfather and father’s services in World War I and World War II, respectively. (Photo from YouTube)
Michael Messner, a USC professor of sociology and gender studies, will be publishing a nonfiction book titled “Guys Like Me: Five Wars, Five Veterans for Peace” on Nov. 9. His book will be released in time for the 100th anniversary of Armistice Day and aims to shed light on the life-changing experiences of American veterans.
The book focuses on five multigenerational men who fought in five different wars, including World War II, the Gulf War, the Korean War, the Vietnam War and the Iraq War. 
Messner’s inspiration for this book stemmed from his grandfather’s service in World War I and his father’s efforts in World War II. 
“The way I grew up was being really fascinated by World War I but like a lot of veterans, [my grandfather] didn’t really want to talk about it,” Messner said.  “It’s very common for veterans of wars to feel that they really would rather not talk about it and to me that’s kind of part of a pattern [of] what I call ‘manly silence.’ It’s men learning … to hold things in and not show your vulnerability. So a lot of veterans … feel a sense of guilt or shame [for] things that they’ve experienced and [for] things that they’ve done.” 
Messner remembers wishing his grandfather a happy Veteran’s Day more than 30 years ago. He was surprised to hear his grandfather respond, noting that the holiday used to be called Armistice Day. Politicians had changed the name so they could keep having more wars, his grandfather said. Armistice Day, however, symbolized the end of all wars and the promise of lasting peace. 
To some veterans, like Messner’s grandfather, the holiday’s 1954 name change was an insult and indicates that the U.S. was founded on war, according to Messner. 
“He was very saddened by that and angry about it, and that’s one of the roots of my interest,” Messner said. “I mean obviously that was 30 or 40 years ago when that happened, but I’ve always kind of held on to that story.”
Due to the misconception, Messner wanted to write a book to uncover the truths behind war, including the personal experiences of veterans and the trauma of war on their bodies, through mental illnesses like PTSD.  
Messner said he interviewed veterans from Veterans for Peace, a nonprofit organization for U.S. veterans, to collect a variety of anecdotes for his book. 
“There [are] a couple [of] other people that I interviewed who aren’t among the five that I really profiled in the first chapter,” Messner said. 
Messner spoke to a female veteran and said that the woman’s anecdote was an important addition to the story since the female military experience is portrayed far less than men’s. 
Another anecdote in Messner’s book is from Ernie Sanchez, a World War II veteran. Messner said that Sanchez left the war because he was suffering from PTSD after he killed around 50 to 100 Germans in the line of duty. 
“[Sanchez] carries that with him for his whole life, and this sort of shame of having killed what he called ‘brothers, sons and people who were loved by others,’” Messner said. 
Messner also said that people’s active participation in war affects the way they view peace. 
“In the United States, most of us are so separated from the experiences of the military and war that we sort of think of ourselves as being at peace and we’re not,” he said. “We’re actually in permanent warfare right now in the world.” 
Messner hopes this book will share the stories of different veterans who were wounded physically and mentally by war. He said that many of these men are on a path to find peace and to separate themselves from the idea of endless war. 
“I want people to understand the experience of these veterans and hear their voices…” Messner said.  “We have these people who we’re sending over in our name… and they’re paying the price for our sense of complacency. These are guys who have come out of that place of silence and trauma and are speaking out for what they see as peace and justice.”

According to a 2002 Harvard study, 18 percent of undergraduate students have used false identification to obtain alcohol, and 51 percent of college students find it easy to obtain alcohol. (Sinead Chang | Daily Trojan)
Irish pub Rock & Reilly’s will open at USC Village later this month, joining a handful of restaurants that serve alcohol on campus. 
USC has an undergraduate population of roughly 20,000 students, most of whom are under 21. Underage consumption of alcohol is illegal and against University policy, according to the USC Student Handbook. According to a 2002 Harvard University study, 51 percent of college students thought that alcohol was “very easy” to obtain, and 18 percent have reported using false identification to obtain alcohol.
However, Vice President of Student Affairs Ainsley Carry said that since other USC Village establishments, including Target, Trader Joe’s and Greenleaf Gourmet Chopshop, also sell alcohol on campus, he doesn’t believe Rock & Reilly’s presence will lead to increased use of fake IDs among students.
“The opportunities for students to use fake IDs to get access to liquor are abundant, and they’re all over the place,” Carry said. “I don’t think a new pub at the Village will create any greater threat than what currently exists.”
While Rock & Reilly’s did not respond to comment on specific measures it would take to effectively prevent student fake ID use, the pub said it is aware of the  issue. 
“We at Rock & Reilly’s invite the community and campus to enjoy our restaurant and bar responsibly,” the pub wrote in a statement to the Daily Trojan. “We are very serious when it comes to fake IDs and underage drinking.”
Earlier this month, the Department of Public Safety reported that Department of Homeland Security officers arrested a student at USC Village FedEx for possessing a package that contained 10 fake IDs. DPS Captain Edgar Palmer said the case is currently being investigated by Homeland Security.
“We routinely cooperate with law enforcement in their investigations,” FedEx wrote in a statement to the Daily Trojan. “We do not publicly disclose information about our security processes and procedures.”
Palmer said there is a range of repercussions for students caught with a fake ID, such as receiving a city citation from the LAPD, having to appear in court or being cited to USC Student Judicial Affairs and Community Standards by DPS.
When law enforcement officials from LAPD or DPS find students using fake IDs, Carry said these incidents are reported to the University, and the student is notified that the incident will go in their student conduct file after the first offense. If there are repeated incidents, the student must meet with SJACS. 
Study abroad, graduate and other University programs will contact SJACS to view its applicants’ disciplinary records and may deny them a spot based on past fake ID citations, Carry said.
USC learned last year that Target, Trader Joe’s and other USC Village establishments that sell alcohol could not detect all fake IDs because their scanning technology was not advanced enough, according to Carry. He said the University continues to encourage all alcohol-serving restaurants and stores on campus to upgrade to advanced scanning technology that will better detect fake IDs. 
“Our primary focus has been at the point of access, where the student is actually purchasing the liquor,” Carry said. “This is a federal offense to sell liquor to someone under the age of 21, so they have to ramp up their technology in order to prevent selling liquor with someone using a fake ID.” 
Palmer said that underage students often want to participate in college drinking culture while overlooking its negative effects. Students often normalize underage drinking and fake ID use, Palmer said, but DPS tries to monitor and prevent these crimes in order to improve student safety.
“Alcohol and the consumption of alcohol leads to a host of other issues that put students in danger, and sometimes the complaints that I get from parents are that we turn a blind eye to the fact that there’s so much consumption of alcohol by underage students,” Palmer said. “That’s certainly not the case. We certainly don’t want students out there doing it, but it is a reality.” 
The Department of Homeland Security did not respond to requests for comment in time for publication.

In the last few months, the headlines have been dominated by Christine Blasey Ford’s sexual assault allegations against Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh and President Donald Trump’s public mocking of Ford’s testimony. Amid these stories, there has been a whirlwind of support for sexual assault victims. Politicians, celebrities and other public figures are now coming forward with their own stories of sexual assault or emphasizing their support for survivors. To create a more open forum for discussion of this perilous issue, people must be educated about the specialized trauma sexual assault victims experience to become more empathetic.
With that said, there are also many coming to the defense of the accused, by asserting that victims should have reported their assaults sooner if their allegations were true.
This defense stems from a misconception of how the human psyche processes sexual assault, and a justice system that continually fails survivors. In fact, this defense exacerbates the unjust shame that has been projected onto sexual assault victims for centuries — and arguably amplifies the fear victims already experience when reporting their sexual assault. This vindication, which is commonly used against sexual assault victims, isn’t a new argument. In most cases, this defense has been purposely used to scare victims back into silence. 
According to the Rape, Abuse & Incest National Network, approximately 310 of 1,000 sexual assaults are reported. Of those reported, it is estimated that only six perpetrators receive a prison sentence. This notion elucidates how the United States’ justice system fails sexual assault victims at an astronomical level. The majority of sexual assault victims who do report their assaults — and endure the painful and lengthy process that is required to do so — seldom see justice served.
The response to this defense, especially in the case of Kavanaugh, isn’t simple — but neither is the question. Sexual assault and its long- and short-term effects are individualized, just like each assault differs from the next. There is rarely a straightforward answer to why some women and men don’t report their assault.
However, it is important to be informed of, and to make an effort to sympathize with, the trauma that victims endure. There is often a disconnect with sexual assault and trauma, which mostly stems from the stigma that surrounds sexual assault. It’s important to understand that this trauma can result in myriad mental illness, including posttraumatic stress disorder, eating disorders and depression, according to RAINN. In some cases, these mental ailments can lead to a suicide or suicide attempts.
It is also important to note that these mental illnesses are often long-term effects of sexual assault, which can play a major role in a victim’s ability to report. The short-term effects of sexual assault tend to be as debilitating as the long-term effects, although they do differ in crucial ways. After sexual assault, victims commonly experience feelings of confusion, anger, sadness, dissociation and shame.
These facts alone should be enough for a person of sound mind to fathom why a victim would not report their assault imminently, if at all. Trauma is complex and therefore requires therapeutic methods to recover from. In some cases, it can takes years — even decades — for a victim to come forth to anyone about their assault, let alone the authorities.
The trauma sexual assault survivors experience is deep and debilitating at times, often coupled with feelings of fear and humiliation. Ford’s courage — not only to come forward with her story but to testify before a congressional committee — sets a precedent for millions of sexual assault victims, and she should not be villainized for her nobility. With sexual assault now at the forefront of public consciousness, thanks to women like Ford, it is imperative that people make an effort to understand the depth of victims’ trauma to facilitate more open and productive dialogues.

Shideh Ghandeharizadeh | Daily Trojan
I love Fifth Harmony.
Originally comprising Ally Brooke, Lauren Jauregui, Camila Cabello, Normani Kordei and Dinah Jane, the platinum record-selling girl group allowed me to feel comfortable and accepted as a gay Latino man.
To contextualize how much I love the girls: I’ve been to at least 10 of their shows, have interviewed them as a group twice, am followed by three of the members on Twitter and even flew to Orlando, Florida. to see the group’s final performance before each member decided to go her own way.
What makes Fifth Harmony so special to me — aside from their fantastic music, choreography and videos — is the multiculturalism they represent, since all five members are women of color. I got to ask them (as a four-piece following Camila’s departure) about this during an interview after the release of the group’s eponymous album last year. I sat next to my favorite member, Ally, and asked the “Work From Home” songstresses how it felt to represent the future since, after all, the United States will be made up of mostly people of color by 2040.
“We hope that we can leave a positive impact on this world, on this industry so that way people can feel love and acceptance that you may feel from us and we feel from each other,” Ally said. 
During its time as a group, Fifth Harmony released multiple songs in Spanish and were featured on tracks with top Latino artists like Maluma, Pitbull and Mexican icon Juan Gabriel. The group even dropped a Spanish version of their song “Worth It” and released an entire Spanish EP titled “Juntos.” The Latinidad in the group shined bright.
I particularly identified with that aspect of the group, specifically with the three Latinas in the group — Ally, Camila and Lauren — and I was ecstatic to have the opportunity to speak with them about an issue as relevant as diversity.
More and more, people like me are able to see themselves represented in the music that we listen to thanks to groups like Fifth Harmony, which put out empowering songs  sung by resilient women of color. 
Ally, who was raised in San Antonio, is Mexican American and cites Selena Quintanilla and Jennifer Lopez as some of her biggest influences. She thanks them for paving the way for Latinas like her. Ally is not afraid to show off her Latina heritage and is now taking the torch, to beautifully represent Latinos. She is set to release her first solo single “Vámonos” completely in Spanish, a project I’m very much looking forward to. She also performed last year on “Lip Sync Battle” with a mashup of Selena + J. Lo with Selena’s song “Como La Flor.”
Ally makes me proud to be Latino and to be a first-generation American.
I feel similarly about Camila, who is the daughter of Mexican and Cuban immigrants. She is adamant about sharing her culture with the world and is never afraid to speak Spanish in her songs, on social media and even during interviews with English publications.
Last April, she wrote an essay about her immigrant experience for PopSugar in which she stated that “this country was built on immigrants.”
“How strong we are to leave behind everything we know in hopes of something better,” Camila wrote, referring to her parents. “We are not fearless, we just have dreams bigger than our fears.”
Camila is right. Like her parents, my parents’ fears — and the fears of all immigrants in the United States — were smaller than their dreams. I, too, am proud of the future mis papás forged for me. 
Needless to say, being in a girl group limited the girls’ ability to express who they were. They were forced to conform to the personalities and song styles that came with being “one of the five.”
But things changed for Lauren, who is Cuban American, after Donald Trump was elected president. In a letter to Trump’s supporters, she came out as a bisexual woman.
She wrote: “I am proud to be the granddaughter and daughter of immigrants who were brave enough to leave their homes and come to a whole new world with a different language and culture and immerse themselves fearlessly to start a better life for themselves and their families.”
Lauren has adamantly condemned the GOP and Trump administration for its heinous policies surrounding immigration. She has even been seen at rallies calling for the reunification of families separated at the border. 
She spoke about her bisexuality on Spirit Day, which celebrates LGBTQ youth, and encouraged her fans to “be secure in who you are and loving yourself.”
“I wish I could have told myself that when I was younger, ‘Just fuck it. Love you. Be you,’” she said. “Stop worrying about whether this person is going to like you or that person’s going to like you because I was very much a people pleaser and I know a lot of us are.”
Now she is completely herself. Her ability to express her identity as a bisexual Cuban American woman encourages me to do the same, as a gay Mexican American man. Lauren isn’t afraid to showcase the multiple layers of who she is and isn’t hesitant to stand up for what she believes in. And I’m so proud of her for that.
Even though Fifth Harmony is no longer a singular unit, I’m going to continue following my girls’ careers as soloists. I’m thankful to them for being voices of resilience and for being the best Latinx representatives I could’ve asked for growing up.
As I sprout into adulthood I will continue looking to the girls as examples of who I am and who I want to be: unafraid to show the world who I am and proud of where I come from.

On Wednesday night, British indie rock band Arctic Monkeys brought its innovative sound to the Hollywood Bowl for the second and final Los Angeles show of its “Tranquility Base Hotel & Casino” tour. 
After the release of their commercially successful 2013 album “AM,” which featured the band’s highest-selling song to date, “Do I Wanna Know?”, band members Alex Turner, Jamie Cook, Nick O’Malley and Matt Helders took a staggering five-year hiatus. The band returned in May to kick off a global tour for its 2018 album. 
Indie pop band Mini Mansions opened the evening with stunning renditions of its ’80s rock-inspired songs to a sparse audience. The Los Angeles-based band maintained its relaxed, yet powerful stage presence, as concertgoers slowly trickled in during the set. 
Pop rock band The Lemon Twigs took the stage next. The crowd seemed less receptive to the brother duo as their glam rock-inspired tunes failed to elicit any applause. In fact, vocalist Michael D’Addario’s incoherent rambling between songs turned off many in the audience. 
Coming off of a sold-out Hollywood Bowl show the night before, Arctic Monkeys finally took the stage and welcomed an excited and anticipatory crowd. 
In contrast to the epic guitar riffs in “Do I Wanna Know?”, Arctic Monkeys’ newest album is more mellow and temperamental. The moody and pensive tone of many of their newer songs, some of which function as social critiques of isolation and greed, were surprisingly adept at filling the flashy, grand ethos of the venue. 
The set began once the quartet, all sharply dressed in suits, took the stage to perform “Four out of Five,” the lead single off from its 2018 album “Tranquility Base Hotel & Casino.” The crowd eagerly welcomed the band on stage amid blinding red lights. 
Next, the band played “Snap Out of It,” which seemed to please many fans who wanted to hear the band integrate both new and old songs into the set. 
Arctic Monkeys also reached further back into their discography to play fan favorites such as “Crying Lightning,” “Knee Socks” and “Do Me a Favour.” Although audience members cheered after hearing the introductory chord progressions of these familiar tracks, many chose to sit or sway quietly, only rising for the big hits. 
Turner’s vocal performance was unmatched and permeated throughout the amphitheater. However, the frontman barely interacted with the audience, only mumbling one quick “thank you” in between songs. The sparse audience interaction made for awkward transitions, leaving the show feeling scripted at certain moments.
Toward the end of the set, Arctic Monkeys played the album’s titular song “Tranquility Base Hotel & Casino.” The Bowl lit up with flashing green lights and the crowd began dancing — an abrupt shift from the subdued reactions just minutes prior. The band also played its most popular hit “Do I Wanna Know?”, which saw the audience singing in unison. 
After bidding the audience goodnight, the band returned to the stage for a three-song encore. 
A large neon sign that read “Monkeys” lit up the stage. After returning to the microphone, Turner entertained the audience with some of the band’s biggest hits, concluding with “R U Mine?”, a song heavily requested by the audience.
Though Arctic Monkeys’ new songs were able to delight Wednesday night’s crowd, the band’s musicality does not necessarily equate to strong stage presence. 
Turner’s vocals were undeniably great — however, the lack of audience interaction and the seemingly scripted nature of the show prevented it from fulfilling its potential.

At Wednesday’s event, director Christopher McQuarrie, producer Jake Myers and film editor Eddie Hamilton hosted a post-screening Q&A with students. (Michael Tseng | Daily Trojan)
USC’s Large Format Cinema Club hosted a special screening of “Mission: Impossible – Fallout,” which was released in July, at the Michelle & Kevin Douglas IMAX Theatre Wednesday. The screening was followed by a Q&A session with director Christopher McQuarrie, producer Jake Myers and film editor Eddie Hamilton, who answered a range of questions pertaining to the mega-action movie’s production process. The film saw Tom Cruise reprise his role as Ethan Hunt, an agent in the Impossible Missions Force.
The “Mission: Impossible” franchise is known for featuring a different director for every installment, but this pattern was interrupted with McQuarrie, who also directed “Mission: Impossible – Rogue Nation.” Due to his role in previous films, McQuarrie wanted to channel the diversity of thought that came with a different crew. He said he only decided to take on another “Mission: Impossible” film because of the opportunity to return with a renewed sense of direction that would diversify the film’s plot.
“I want to make a more emotional movie than the last movie,” McQuarrie said. “I want it to be more about Ethan’s inner life, so we started with story instead of action.” 
Myers was initially hesitant to produce a “Mission: Impossible” movie, but was convinced after thinking about the impressive helicopter scenes and the countless other action shots that have become signatures of the franchise.
To ensure a new perspective in this installment, the crew made a map of the “Mission” universe and marked all the places where the movie had previously been shot or taken place.
“It was very important to Tom [Cruise], the travel log, the feeling of exotic, non-U.S. locations, so we do a little bit of a world tour to figure out where we’re gonna set the movie,” Myers said. 
Once the filmmakers decided what kind of action scenes and locations they wanted to feature, they pieced together a cohesive storyline. Both McQuarrie and Myers praised Cruise for his work ethic and vision, which helped expedite production. 
However, about two-thirds through the shooting of the movie, Cruise broke his ankle and the project was halted. Although this seemed like a devastating blow to Cruise who did most of his own stunts and action scenes, there was a silver lining. Hamilton fished through hundreds of hours of footage to create a preview of the movie that allowed the team to follow through on its early release date. 
“Every shot has to be a slam-dunk, almost,” Hamilton said. “It has to be alive. It has to have energy. It has to have story. There’s a lot of things that every frame of this movie has to have.” 
The tireless work of the cast and crew allowed “Mission: Impossible – Fallout” to become the highest-grossing installment  in the franchise, but this feat did not come easily, McQuarrie said. 
“If we had known any sequence in this movie, at some point someone would say, ‘If we had known, we never would have done this,’” McQuarrie said.

Sophomore driver Jacob Mercep’s 44 goals rank second on the team this season. (Josh Dunst | Daily Trojan)
After a close 10-9 victory against the formerly top-ranked Stanford in the championship match of the Mountain Pacific Invitational last Sunday, No. 1 USC will take on two more top-10 opponents this weekend in No. 8 Long Beach State and No. 6 Pepperdine.
The Trojans are coming off a strong weekend, not only securing a championship win but also sweeping the MPSF weekly honors. Freshman goalie Nic Porter was named Newcomer of the Week for the second time this season, while sophomore driver Jacob Mercep earned USC’s first Player of the Week honor of the season.
Following the accomplishments of the past week, the team shifted its focus to prepare for Long Beach State and Pepperdine, drawing on strategies that have contributed to its prior successes.
“We always have a specific preparation,” Mercep said. “[Head coach Jovan Vavic] does his job and the other coaches do their job very well. They break down the other team, and what they are trying to do, and when the game comes, we are ready for it and we know what’s coming.”
The Men of Troy will face their first test of the weekend when they visit Long Beach State on Saturday. The two teams met  at last weekend’s Mountain Pacific Invitational, where the Trojans bested the 49ers 14-8. Although USC has an all-time record of 70-15 against Long Beach, last year’s meeting between the two teams was quite close, with the Trojans narrowly defeating the 49ers in overtime at home.
To come out on top against Long Beach, the Trojans will need to play well at both ends of the pool. A cohesive defensive effort will be necessary to counter the 49ers offense, led by redshirt junior attacker Austin Stewart, who boasts a team-high 33 goals this season. Capitalizing on offensive opportunities will also be important, as sophomore goalie Marwan Darwish has a .434 save percentage.
After returning from Long Beach, the Trojans will face Pepperdine on Sunday. The Waves enter the weekend with an 11-8 overall record after a sixth-place finish in the Mountain Pacific Invitational. Pepperdine’s leading scorer is senior center Chris Dilworth, who has put up 43 goals so far this season. His performance has not gone unnoticed by the Trojan coaching staff, who have focused on defense in  practice this week.
“Defending fast breaks and opponents’ frontcourt offense is always our main emphasis, and I think we will only grow in our form during this season,” Mercep said of the team’s preparation.
The Trojans plan to apply the lessons they learned in last weekend’s victory against Stanford, which handed the Trojans their only loss of the season, to this weekend’s matches against opponents of similar calibers.
“Certainly we learned that we are tougher than we thought we were,” Mercep said of the Trojans’ tournament performance. “Whether things went good or bad, we showed character, and showed that we are really strong, collective and we stick together. We showed that we really can perform the way we set it up at the meetings, the way we agree upon doing.”
Despite their No. 1 ranking, the Men of Troy continue to consider their potential for growth.
“[Our play] can always be better,” Mercep said. “We are always trying to improve every day. We really strive towards excellence.”
The weekend’s first opportunity for the Trojans will be Saturday at 1 p.m. at Long Beach State. The Trojans will host Sunday’s 1 p.m. match against Pepperdine at Uytengsu Aquatic Center.

As I gear up for a trip to Salt Lake City to cover USC’s matchup against the Utes, I can’t help but have an overwhelming feeling of foreboding. I can easily see this game being a combination of two of my least favorite aspects of sports: blowouts and injuries. 
The loss of senior linebacker Porter Gustin and the possibility of not having senior linebacker Cameron Smith, both due to injury, are not only a significant loss from both a leadership and talent perspective, but also an injustice to the game of football. 
Both players are captains who have a magnificent knowledge of the game and have aided some of the younger guys on the squad. They have been one of the primary reasons USC’s defense is so solid, not to mention the fact that Gustin has seven sacks, while the rest of the team combined have six. Moreover, USC’s defense has kept the team in countless games this season. USC could have beaten Stanford if the offense managed to score points; Arizona could have been a loss if the Trojans didn’t make several key defensive stops and Washington State was a field goal away from handing the Trojans a key Pac-12 defeat. The offense is very fortunate to have a defense that busts its butts to keep the team in the game. 
From the other side: If you are Utah, do you want to beat a Trojan team missing two of its best players? No. Sports fans should want to see the best competition from both sides go head-to-head and battle it out to claim the top of the Pac-12 South, but unfortunately I don’t think we are going to see that this weekend. The lack of key defensive players this week will most likely lead to USC’s demise.
I’ve said this in many columns this year: The USC offense has the talent; it just needs to pull it all together. The Trojans need to get the running and passing game going at the same time. The offense looked extremely dominant in the first half against Colorado; several deep passes from freshman quarterback JT Daniels reconciled his early turnover troubles and led to a 21-point half. However, many people overlook the fact that USC posted a fat zero in the rushing yards column in the first 30 minutes. That cannot happen, especially not when a team has a trio of running backs who have shown they know how to be dominant.
Doubling down, Utah is second in defensive rankings, allowing an average of just 74.8 rushing yards per game. Fortunately for USC, Daniels and his wide receivers should be able to find some long gains on deep passes against the Utes. Regardless, the one dimensional offensive approach will likely not be enough to best Utah, especially in Salt Lake City.
I am not blaming the offense but commending the defense. The offense is young and inexperienced; consistency shouldn’t be expected. But if the Trojans want to win this weekend, they will have to pull something together. 
If the Trojans want to hold a close matchup in this game, the offense needs to figure it out now. I would love to see a shootout. I would love to see the Trojans and the Utes take turns demonstrating fantastic offensive drives, but right now I don’t see that happening. With USC’s losses, it doesn’t look like the defense will be able to hold the incohesive offense in the game. That is why I’m projecting a blowout in favor of the Utes. 
This game is crucial in determining the remainder of the season. USC is likely to run the table in its final Pac-12 games, even without Gustin. In the remaining games, there is no conference competition that should scare USC. A win in Utah will almost certainly allow USC to clinch a spot in the Pac-12 Championship Game. As head coach Clay Helton always says, “USC can control its own destiny.”

The Trojans will roll into Rice-Eccles Stadium in Salt Lake City on Saturday looking to extend their win streak to four, and to possibly secure a spot in the Pac-12 Championship game. It won’t be an easy task by any means; Rice-Eccles and its ear-splitting energy have famously been the bane of visiting Trojan squads in the past, and the Utes won’t be a pushover either. 
Utah sits with the same 4-2 record as USC, coming off of an impressive upset of Stanford, which beat the Trojans, and a 32-point throttling of Arizona. The Trojans’ victory against Colorado last week was a huge step toward securing the Pac-12 South and a spot in the conference championship. After this week, the Trojans’ conference schedule appears to be an easy run of wins as they play Arizona State, Cal, Oregon State and UCLA. A win against a tough Utah team on the road this weekend will likely solidify USC as the champions of the south.
USC offense vs. Utah defense
The USC offense was almost entirely one dimensional last week as it shredded the Buffaloes in the deep passing game to the tune of 283 yards and three touchdowns through the air. The offensive line performed well in pass protection for the third-straight game, giving freshman quarterback JT Daniels clean pockets to work from all night. Daniels wasn’t perfect, but his connection with receivers junior Michael Pittman and redshirt sophomore Tyler Vaughns continued to progress, as he repeatedly kept the chains moving with passes downfield. Pittman stood out with five passes for 155 yards and two touchdowns. 
“The thing I’ve been thoroughly impressed with [Daniels] is how fast he picks up playbook material,” Head coach Clay Helton said. “He’s so advanced mentally. He’s the main reason we’ve won the last three games against three quality teams.”
The run game, however, couldn’t find its rhythm, with the Trojans failing to net positive ground yardage in the first half, ending the game with only 51 rushing yards. The offensive line failed to create any sort of push off the ball making it difficult for both senior running backs Aca’Cedric Ware and sophomore Stephen Carr to find running lanes.
The Utes run defense is ranked No. 2 in the nation, giving up an average of only 74.8 rush yards a game. Utah plays with a stacked box, often leaving its defensive backs in man coverage with senior safety Marqise Blair playing single-high coverage deep. 
“Because of the quality of free safety that we’re getting ready to play in Blair, [one important key for Daniels] is being really disciplined with [his] eyes,” Helton said. “If you give away your intentions, [Blair’s] got enough range and enough speed to pick any ball off even on one hop. It’s important that [Daniels] does not lock in on receivers.” 
Although the Trojans will find it difficult to run against the physical Utah front seven, their scheme in the secondary leaves them prone to exploitation down the field via the passing game, with their No. 67-ranked pass defense. Look for Daniels to continue launching deep shots to Pittman, Vaughns and freshman receiver Amon-Ra St. Brown to keep the chains moving.
Utah offense vs. USC defense
The Utah offense runs through junior Zach Moss. The running back has been following up his phenomenal campaign from last year with another strong season, with 617 rush yards on a healthy 5.6 yards per carry. 
Junior quarterback Tyler Huntley throws the ball efficiently on a low volume of throws, working well with Moss and the run game, capitalizing on play action plays. 
USC’s run defense has been impressive in recent weeks as they’ve held Colorado, Arizona and Washington State to under 100 rushing yards each. Although Moss and Utah’s physical offensive line provide a much higher degree of difficulty, the Trojan defense is well equipped to handle a run-first offense, given the health of linebackers freshman Palaie Gaoteote and senior Cameron Smith, who may not play Saturday. 
“[Gaoteote is a] very smart and instinctive kid,” Helton said. “That linebacker position is like being a quarterback of the defense, and having to make calls and adjustments based on strength of formation. You’re literally a quarterback back there having to make those calls plus doing your own job.”
Though Utah’s passing offense isn’t as lethal, Huntley and his receivers can make big plays, especially when he’s given time in the pocket. USC rediscovered its pass rush on Saturday after it was practically nonexistent for weeks, racking up four sacks on the Buffaloes. However, in doing so, the Trojans lost their best pass-rusher in senior linebacker Porter Gustin, who will miss the rest of his senior season with a broken ankle.
The loss of Gustin is a huge blow to the defense, and it remains to be seen how it will fill the void of his absence on the pass rush. If the front seven can manage to step up, it’ll be huge for the Trojans’ chances.
“They are a very good third down and one to five team,” Helton said. “You try to get them to a third and seven plus, and try and make them to a drop back pass team. That is where we thrive defensively, because we have the pass rush skill to get to the quarterback.”
Injury report
Gaoteote has been cleared to play after suffering a concussion against Colorado. He practiced on Thursday but will be a gametime decision on Saturday, along with senior linebacker Cameron Smith. Smith is progressing and moving around well, according to Helton. Redshirt senior cornerback Jonathan Lockett will travel to Utah with the team but will also be a gametime decision.
Prediction: USC 28-Utah 21
Expect this to be a tough, gritty game. Rice-Eccles Stadium is one of the toughest venues to play in college football, and with a Pac-12 South title in the balance, expect the Utes crowd to bring the noise and make life difficult for the Trojans. However, USC is built to match the strengths and weaknesses of this Utah team, able to light it up passing downfield and able to play tough run defense. It’ll be a hard fought contest, but look for the Trojans to eke this one out as they take advantage of the Ute’s aggressive front seven and slow down Moss and the run game.
Steele decommits
Five-star cornerback Chris Steele from St. John Bosco High School decommitted on Thursday. 
“I have decided that it would be best for me to decommit from USC and open up my recruitment so that I can find a place that will help me reach all the goals that I wish to accomplish,” Steele tweeted in his statement. “There is no love lost for USC, it’s my hometown school and they will always hold a special place in my heart.”
