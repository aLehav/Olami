This is not the first column I expected to write; however, I do expect it to be the most difficult.
After learning of Kobe Bryant’s passing Sunday, I felt consumed — consumed by shock, consumed by sadness, consumed by a deep sense of loss. Kobe was an idol of mine as a child. I grew up watching Lakers games throughout elementary and middle school and could probably still find his jersey buried somewhere in my closet at home, the first jersey my father ever bought for me.
However, the rush of all these emotions was accompanied by something almost just as painful: a consuming sense of conflict and confusion as I tried to reconcile Kobe’s near God-like standing in my childhood with his complicated off-the-court legacy.
As nearly every news outlet has described, Kobe was many things: an 18-time NBA All-Star, league MVP and five-time NBA champion. Kobe was also a role model with a work ethic and tenacity so legendary that they served as an inspiration not only for basketball but also life.
Los Angeles Times columnist Bill Plaschke expressed these same sentiments following Kobe’s death.
“On your best days, the days you landed a big account or aced a big test or just survived a battle with traffic, you felt like Kobe,” Plaschke wrote. “You were Kobe.”
Countless others have written and spoken about Kobe’s life in some form or another since his untimely death. Bill Simmons, famed sports columnist and host of the B.S. podcast, called the day the saddest in NBA history. Jimmy Kimmel, host of “Jimmy Kimmel Live!” described Kobe as “a hero in the way Superman is a hero” before choking back tears later in his monologue.
From celebrities to former presidents, it felt as if the entire world stopped on Sunday to remember and pay tribute to the man that was Kobe Bryant.
I do not blame them.
By all accounts, Kobe appears to have been a curious, hard-working man who sincerely loved his family and was deeply devoted to his daughters — a man whom, in many aspects of his life, we should all aspire to resemble.
Unfortunately, the tributes, stats and stories do not tell the full story of Kobe’s legacy. Along with all of the accolades, points scored and records broken, a dark chapter of Kobe’s career has been glossed over and cast aside as “off-the-court stuff” in the wake of his death.
However, the aforementioned chapter of Kobe’s life was far more than just an incident. It was when a 19-year-old girl accused then 24-year-old Bryant of rape in 2003.
According to the accuser, who was then a desk clerk at a hotel in Colorado, she was giving Kobe a tour of the hotel when Kobe began to grope and kiss her. The details of what allegedly happened next are disturbing and include the allegation that Bryant raped the young women over her repeated cries for him to stop.
According to the police transcript of an interview conducted with the woman the next day, she knew Bryant could hear her because “every time I said no he tightened his hold around me.”
When police questioned Kobe, he denied having sex with the woman three times before learning they’d taken semen and blood evidence. He then admitted to having sexual intercourse with the accuser but argued that it was consensual.
Kobe was charged with felony assault. Over the course of his 14-month criminal proceedings, Kobe’s defense team, along with much of the media, emphasized his accuser’s promiscuity, her struggles with depression and her enthusiasm to meet the basketball legend. The case ended when the young woman stopped cooperating after her name was revealed to the media three times. In the post-#MeToo era, it is not difficult to surmise why she may have asked prosecutors to drop her case.
I confess I do not know exactly what to do with this information. In the days since Kobe’s death I have alternated between feeling empty at the sudden loss of a childhood hero to feeling enraged at the prospect that on at least one night, he might’ve been a monster.
I also admit that I am somewhat fearful about writing this column. I am fearful that I may be inappropriately besmirching a man’s memory only days after his death and the death of his 13-year-old daughter, Gianna. I am fearful that I might be more concerned with protecting a powerful man’s name than acknowledging the indescribable pain of a potential rape survivor.
However, in light of all this, I do not believe it is either controversial or heroic to merely recommend that, as we discuss and reconstruct Kobe’s legacy over the upcoming days, months and years, we consider the worst elements of his legacy along with the best.
It is easy to claim you believe women, that you are attuned and enlightened to the social sensitivities of our time or that you have no tolerance for sexual misconduct. It becomes more difficult when the man at the center of said misconduct is Kobe Bryant.
The #MeToo movement challenged many people’s conscious and subconscious attitudes toward women and victims of sexual harassment and violence. Since its start, countless men who previously escaped consequences have faced justice.
If we have learned anything from the national reckoning that was that movement, and if we hope to live by its highest virtues, we must remember Kobe’s legacy in its entirety.

The USC women’s basketball team is headed to the Grand Canyon State to face off against No. 19 Arizona State Friday and No. 16 Arizona Sunday. The Trojans are looking to avenge earlier losses to both rival Pac-12 South teams on the road after winning their last three games at home.
Currently 11-8 on the season, USC did not have much success on the road in its early matchups, going 2-4 away from Galen Center. This weekend the Trojans will have the chance to reverse those struggles and further improve their No. 8 conference standing.
The Sun Devils and Wildcats have experience on their upperclassmen-heavy rosters that powered over the young Trojan team at the beginning of conference play. Led by junior guard Aari McDonald’s 24-point performance, Arizona delivered a 65-57 win at Galen Center Jan. 3.
Arizona State converted 27 points off of turnovers for a 63-54 win two days later.
Since these two games in the middle of the Trojans’ early five-game losing streak, USC has turned around its defense and adjusted offensively. Against Washington State, USC never allowed a lead change and logged 44 rebounds. In last Sunday’s overtime win over Washington, the Trojans shot 43.3% from the field with freshman guard Endyia Rogers tallying a career-high 29 points.
Rogers now joins forward Alissa Pili as the second USC player to receive the Pac-12 Freshman of the Week award for women’s basketball this year. Their home performances have cemented their leadership roles for the young team and show the level of competition they are capable of.
“It’s pretty exciting because we’re very young, to win three big wins back-to-back — UCLA, Washington State, Washington — that’s a pretty big accomplishment,” Rogers said. “But we have to keep on working to get more wins.”
To prepare for ASU, USC should anticipate a Sun Devil team hungry for another conference win. Their five-game winning streak that propelled them to the No. 16 spot in the national rankings was snapped by Arizona in a 59-53 loss last week. 
Look out for senior guard Robbi Ryan, who shot a career-high 25 points against Arizona and is now averaging 42% from the field. Pili and senior forward Kayla Overbeck will also have to stop senior forward Ja’Tavia Tapley, who transferred from USC in April and is now averaging seven rebounds per game. 
On Sunday the Trojans will head to Tucson for their matchup with the Wildcats. Besides the offensive threat McDonald poses, USC will have to handle sophomore center Semaj Smith who posted a career-high 12 rebounds in Arizona’s last game against the Trojans.
Washington ran out to an early 19-point lead on the Wildcats on Jan. 19 that took Arizona three quarters to erase. The Trojans took on a similar deficit and took over the lead in the third in their first Arizona game this season. Maintaining consistency for all 40 minutes could help solidify a win for USC. The Trojans will have to maintain a competitive fire if they want to finish this revenge trip with wins under their belt.
“[We] just gotta compete,” head coach Mark Trakh said. “Since we’ve got a really young team, we’re like, we just gotta go play, we got nothing to lose.”
The Trojans will tip off against ASU Friday at 10 a.m. and against Arizona Sunday at 11 a.m.

Having won four of its last five games and sitting in a tie for second place in the Pac-12, the USC men’s basketball team will face Utah Thursday night at Galen Center. Led by phenom freshman forward Onyeka Okongwu, the Trojans are set to play a Utes team led by sophomore forward Timmy Allen that is coming off two straight wins against Washington State and Washington.
Okongwu is top-five in the Pac-12 in rebounds, blocks and field goal percentage this season and does not seem to show any signs of slowing down. He and the Trojans — the best in the Pac-12 in rebounds and the worst in free-throw percentage and turnovers committed — will attempt to stop a Utah team that currently ranks first in the conference in free throw percentage.
USC is coming back from a two-game road trip in the Beaver State, where the Trojans fell to No. 12 Oregon in double overtime but triumphed over Oregon State. A couple of costly turnovers and mistakes late in the Oregon game caused USC to suffer their second Pac-12 loss, but the win over Oregon State proved the Trojans’ potential is still alive and well in the conference.
“Honestly, this was the most confident game I’ve had all season,” Okongwu said per the Associated Press after USC’s win over the Beavers. “It was really fun coming out there and playing against a sold-out crowd.”
The crowd of more than 9,000 in Corvallis, Ore. was in for a treat as they got a chance to watch a united USC team that has excited college basketball fans with acrobatic plays from Okongwu and freshman guard Ethan Anderson, a clutch comeback win against Stanford led by sophomore guard Elijah Weaver and solid 3-point shooting from senior forward Nick Rakocevic and redshirt senior guards Quinton Adlesh and Daniel Utomi.
“Rakocevic and [Okongwu], those guys are a load inside,” Utah head coach Larry Krystkowiak said at a press conference Tuesday. “[USC is] an elite rebounding team in our league, shot-blocking team. They provide a great post presence for those guys and then they’ve got a bunch of capable shooters and athletes.”
USC will also have to look out for Utah redshirt freshman center Lahat Thioune in the paint, as the Senegal native is the Utes’ leader in field goal percentage at 72.2%, making him their most efficient player while averaging just 17 minutes per game.
USC head coach Andy Enfield and his team should also expect Utah to both commit and draw lots of fouls given the two teams’ shooting percentages from the charity stripe. The Trojans have arguably struggled at the free-throw line more than they have anywhere else on the court this season.
However, as Enfield said after the Oregon State win, USC’s resilience both at home and on the road “is a credit to [USC’s] players” at this point of the season and is what has helped the Trojans catapult themselves into a tie with No. 20 Colorado for second place in the conference.
Expect Allen, Thioune and freshman guard Rylan Jones to run a majority of Utah’s offense and look for Okongwu and Rakocevic to make important plays near the rim on both sides of the ball.
USC and Utah will tip off Thursday at 6:30 p.m. at Galen Center.

Mental health and treatment for mental illness can be rooted all the way back to ancient Greece. Even though the Greeks didn’t get everything exactly right, they were the first recorded population to see mental illness for what it was: an ailment of the mind. Before then, and even still, many attributed the symptoms of mental illness to a demonic possession or a sign of malevolent deities. 
It’s understandable why people in the ancient times viewed mental illness as a procurement of an evil spirit, since that seemed to be the only logical answer at that time. However, through significant medical research over the years — especially over the past century — doctors and medical researchers alike have attributed the symptoms of mental ailments to a wide array of mental illnesses. In short, the Greeks were onto something and medical research and clinical trials conducted centuries later back them up.
With that said, there remains an ever-present heavy stigma that comes along with the treatment of mental illness that may be rooted to the age-old assumptions of demonic possession and similar narratives. It’s fair to say that most people in today’s world understand mental illness for what it is — an illness. However it’s the treatment that is still not approached in the same manner as, for example, a broken leg, and that is where the stigma lies.
Whether it’s a bout with depression,  lingering grief over the loss of a loved one, overwhelming stress caused by the school deadlines or even just symptoms of untreated mental illness, therapy is essential. Talk therapy is a completely normal and healthy approach to ensuring your overall wellness, and it should never be looked down upon or labeled as unnecessary. It is the first step to take in caring for your mental health and arguably the most crucial element to achieving overall wellness.
I know this to be true because I was 9  years old when I went to therapy for the first time. Most consider this to be quite young for therapy, but, over time I’ve learned that you’re never too young — or too old for that matter — to assess feelings. My mom told me that she was going to introduce me to “someone special” that I could talk to, and as a quiet 9-year-old with no concept of mental health or wellness (and an overwhelming need for my parents’ approval), I blindly obliged and said, “OK!”
It was pretty awkward for a while. For the first couple of weeks, I would just sit there and stare at the wall or fixate on the rug fibers below my feet, forcing my therapist to probe me to speak. After a few months, I started to open up and feel more comfortable talking about the surface level issues in my life — like the disagreement I had with my best friend or how sad I was that my crush didn’t notice my new outfit at school — but I still avoided touchy subjects.
It took years for me to be able to open up and talk about my trauma. Years. I had internalized all of this pain and anguish for so long that I had convinced myself that doing so would make it all just go away. What happened, though, was just the opposite. My mental health snowballed, and my issues became more difficult to articulate. I found myself to be emotionally stunted as a 9-year-old, and it took a lot of hard work to forge the long road of healing.
I am 20 now, and I try to attend therapy weekly. There are still things that, after 11 years, I struggle to talk about. With that said, I cannot imagine where I’d be, or even if I would be, without therapy. It’s a daunting thought — but nonetheless a reminder of the necessity of therapy and the importance of mental health to overall wellness. I am eternally grateful to my first therapist, Amy, for being so astute, patient, kind and understanding. I am grateful for my mother and her awareness in understanding that my trauma would only worsen without early intervention.
Therapy is a crucial component of mental health, and it’s essential to overall wellness. No matter how big or small you believe your problems to be — therapy helps give an objective perspective to these issues and provide insight to work through them. There is no “right” time or age to go to therapy, and it should always be approached free of stigma or judgment. 
I hope that, through this column, that sentiment will persist. Together, we can solidify a healthy and open approach to mental health and wellness.

It’s been almost six months since India revoked Kashmir’s constitutional rights. Located in the northern region of the India subcontinent, Kashmir has been the subject of dispute between South Asia, Pakistan and China for over half a century. International outcries over the human rights abuses committed in the region aren’t as powerful as they were back then. While some universities have arranged talks on their  campuses, as well as movements to call out the atrocities carried out against Kashmiris and  discuss the gross human rights violations, USC has done little compared to other universities, which have. 
It is important to address two main questions: What’s happening in Kashmir today? And, why is it relevant to American universities?
Kashmir has been disputed territory between India and Pakistan since 1947, with both nations claiming ownership over the region. Since then, both countries have engaged in large-scale and guerilla warfare over the region.  Last August, India removed Article 370 from its Constitution — which allowed Indian Administered Kashmir to make its own laws except on matters of defense, finance, foreign affairs and communications. Article 35A which was also revoked, formerly allowed the administered region’s state legislature to define “permanent residents” of its area. Essentially, revoking those articles meant stripping Kashmir of the little autonomy they had left. 
Kashmiris are still suffering today. The internet was blocked in the region until Jan. 25, and 2G access is allowed to only whitelisted websites. For six months, Kashmiris were unable to tell their families outside the region about the acts of injustice carried out against them. They couldn’t tell them about the power shutdowns, the children who were unable to go to school, the women who were abused nor the  protesters and the common civilians who had been killed. 
There has been some international support but clearly not enough. On an issue like this, where rights that matter to us are being violated, it’s crucial to voice outrage at what is happening. In these instances, it is especially important for institutions of higher education to speak out against injustice.
USC claims to harbor diverse perspectives, to teach students to think critically about world issues and to have students attempt to understand an array of problems. Why hasn’t there been further information about Kashmir then?
There’s a number of changes USC can make to address the Kashmir issue.
First, USC should invite speakers to educate students about what is happening. Perhaps a faculty member from the Gender and Sexuality Studies department could speak to the violations carried out against women in Kashmir in the context of gendered violence in conflict zones. Organizing these discussions allows for greater visibility and for the issue to be the center of more debate. 
A long-term solution to address the issue is also to incorporate more classes on South Asian history, some that pertain specifically to Kashmir. This could work as a freshman general education seminar or an international relations general education course taught specifically on Kashmir.
With these improvements, students will be more well-equipped to talk about Kashmir and take initiative. While other campuses have already started the conversation, it’s time USC takes a stand too.
Political debate has already begun to stagnate internationally, and it is USC’s duty to keep the voice of Kashmiris alive. If USC stays silent as an institution on issues like this, is it really as diverse-minded or “woke” as it claims to be?
CORRECTION: A previous version of this article that Kashmir has been the subject of dispute between India, Pakistan and China for over half a century. Kashmir is in dispute between South Asia, Pakistan and China. The Daily Trojan regrets this error.

Following rumors that a case of coronavirus broke out near USC Monday night, the University affirmed that news of an outbreak would not come from an apartment management team but from L.A. County public health authorities first.
On Monday night, students feared that the virus may have spread to the USC community after off-campus housing complex The Lorenzo emailed tenants erroneously stating that a resident had contracted the virus. 
Chief Health Officer Sarah Van Orman said that if an individual from the USC community were to contract the virus, Student Health would first inform the Los Angeles Department of Public Health, which would inform the public of any development involving the coronavirus.
“The Department of Public Health is the only agency that has the authority to release the results,” Van Orman told the Daily Trojan. “In the event that there were students affected, they would let us know. They would put out a public press release like we saw over the weekend for the non-USC individual.”
Health officials confirmed two cases of coronavirus in Los Angeles and Orange counties Sunday. There has been no evidence of person-to-person transmission in these two cases. Currently, the Center for Disease Control is investigating more than 100 potential cases of coronavirus, with five cases confirmed, 70 under investigation and 30 with negative results. However, no one affiliated with USC is currently under investigation, Van Orman said.
Posts about the false outbreak filled social media, including the USC memes page on Facebook. One on the memes page read “University of Spreading Coronavirus” and another included a photo depicting fake face masks engraved with USC’s initials.
Some concerned students also created a petition that night requesting that USC cancel classes. It garnered nearly 10,000 signatures.
Some students reported seeing fire trucks and members of the Los Angeles Fire Department outside the apartment complex that evening. According to DPS Daily Crime and Fire Logs, a student was transported to a local hospital near 9 p.m. after reporting a sore throat and fatigue.
The Lorenzo later retracted their notice, apologizing for the release of false information. The Lorenzo declined to further comment on the incident and redirected communication to USC Media Relations. 
Van Orman said the ill student was screened for coronavirus symptoms through a checklist developed by the Los Angeles County Department of Public Health per protocol, saying what occurred on the scene may have led to miscommunication. 
While there are at least five confirmed coronavirus cases in the U.S., the situation is not as severe as it is in Wuhan, China, and other parts of the nation, where the virus first spread, Van Orman said.
USC is currently working with LAPHD to monitor developments in Los Angeles. L.A. has not placed a quarantine for those returning from Wuhan or any affected areas. Van Orman encouraged individuals experiencing symptoms to seek immediate medical care.
“There’s social distancing,” she said. “I think there’s confusion because of the measures being taken in China, where they have a localized population with thousands of cases, versus the measures that we might, for example, take in the United States, where we have had a handful of cases that have been contained. It’s a very different situation.”
USC Student Health plans to increase communication to continue to ease student concerns on the outbreak and relay the preventative measures being taken.

If you think your Thanksgiving hosts had their plates full preparing to have over dozens of guests, you must have never dined at Chabad or Hillel. Week after week, each organization hosts hundreds of students and members of the community for Friday night dinner, celebrating the beginning of the Jewish Sabbath, known as Shabbat. 
Jan. 31 is no different in the Jewish world. Jews around the world will still celebrate the end of the week together. But at USC, it will be an extra special day: Shabbat 1,000. Over 1,000 people — students, family, community members and guests — will swarm the Sigma Chi parking lot for the largest Shabbat dinner anywhere on the West Coast, according to Chabad Rabbi Dov Wagner. 
Shabbat 1,000 is an annual event spearheaded by Chabad @ USC and co-hosted by over 10 other student groups, including USC Hillel, the Office of Religious Life, Undergraduate Student Government, and several Greek organizations. Despite its record numbers, the event never gets enough attention or coverage because, in traditional Judaism, Jews refrain from using electronics during the Shabbat. That makes it difficult to take a 1,000-person photo to show off the attendance, it makes it impossible to Instagram live stream the huge crowd and it prevents the hosts from showcasing the piles and piles of gourmet food served. 
The mega-Shabbat event began in 2007, back when it was called “Shabbat 300.” The number of attendees grew and grew, to the point where it was renamed “Shabbat 500,” and over the last two years, closer to 700 people attended. The most amazing thing about Chabad is that they never seem to be satisfied. After racing past its goal by nearly 50%, the organization upped its target to 1,000 attendees in 2018, and they haven’t looked back since. 
Shabbat 1,000 is not exclusively for Jewish Trojans. According to Rabbi Wagner, this is an opportunity for Jewish students at USC to invite their fellow Trojans of all backgrounds and faiths to their Shabbat table, to showcase with pride all of the facets of Jewish life at USC. Every year, hundreds of non-Jews share the event with their Jewish friends and learn about Jewish practices and culture, all while enjoying a five-course meal. 
USC Dean of Religious Life Varun Soni has long been speaking about the mental health crisis millennials and Gen Zers have been facing. 
“Historically, it’s been the oldest generation in the United States that has been the loneliest,” Soni said in an interview with Harvard Divinity School. “But studies now show that the loneliest generation in the United States right now are post-millennials, our youngest. There is a crisis, a spiritual crisis of loneliness, in higher education among students.” 
And it’s true. Despite technology providing countless opportunities for connection —  virtual connection — people feel more disconnected than ever. Flip through the pages of the Daily Trojan papers from the past several years, read through the platforms of USG candidates from election after election, and you’ll see how class after class college students consistently say they want to better their mental health. Without taking away from the calls for better University healthcare, perhaps there is a preventative secret in the Shabbat concept of face-to-face connection and putting the phone down over dinner. 
While the origins of Shabbat — God resting on the seventh day — appear purely religious, it’s actually more mundane than one would think and far more applicable to today than ever before. Simply put, Shabbat is a time for time. It allows us to step back after a busy week and focus on the present, to spend time with those around us — whether it be friends or family or new guests at the dinner table. 
Common logic would hold that the most efficient laborers work nonstop. But it turns out that adding a day of rest actually increases efficiency and prevents burnout — we’re human, after all. It was a novel concept developed back in Genesis and it seems to have done us pretty well ever since. But an event like Shabbat 1,000 does more than just remind us of the importance of rest. It emphasizes how vibrant the Trojan Family is and showcases that there is a community for everyone at USC.

It’s no secret that USC, sometimes jokingly referred to as the “University of Spoiled Children,” is expensive. Aside from the lofty tuition price, smaller costs such as buying textbooks and eating out can really add up. And yet, it appears that the University isn’t doing much to lower these inevitable costs. 
Many on-campus shops such as the USC Bookstore and Seeds Marketplace tend to be on the expensive side, at times even selling products above retail prices. The community-centered USC Village is home to high-priced restaurants and a nail salon. Not only is this unnecessary, but it also makes parts of the community fundamentally exclusive to students who have more money to spend. For those who cannot attend but still need the same supplies and resources, USC must do a better job of providing affordable options.
USC consistently boasts its socioeconomically diverse student body, writing that they have “one of the most abundant financial aid pools in the country.” According to the New York Times, nearly 5% of the student population of USC comes from the bottom 20% of wealth in this country. Yet, despite the fact that many students from low-income families attend USC, the school fails to provide convenient, low-cost options for basic college needs. 
In some cases, on-campus food options even upcharge basic items under the guise of “convenience.” At the popular Seeds Marketplace, an Rx protein bar costs about $4, while the same item costs around $2 at a regular grocery store.  
USC Village is also home to a slough of pricier eating options, such as Sunlife Organics and Greenleaf Gourmet Chopshop. At Sunlife Organics, a Malibu-based chain, acai bowls are priced up to $35 and individual smoothies are sold at up to $28. While USC Village is often marketed as a community-focused shopping area, it is hard to believe this is actually the case. 
The average annual income in the community neighboring USC, historic South Central Los Angeles, is $40,000. Meanwhile, the average median income for a USC student is over four times that, at $161,000. While these expensive restaurants and nail salons are perhaps in demand by some select students, they are simply overpriced as compared to stores in the surrounding area. Many lower-income students and community members simply don’t have the money to spend on these expensive shops. 
Of course, eating out in general is not the best choice for someone on a strict budget. However, when it comes to more necessary expenses such as class supplies, USC again fails to promote affordability. The USC Bookstore is perhaps the most notorious example of the school’s focus on profit over practicality. Despite a poorly advertised “price match guarantee,” many students avoid the bookstore because of the overpriced products. Many professors even encourage students to order textbooks or class materials online due to the expensive nature of the more convenient bookstore. For example, students in a basic ceramics class at USC are required to buy a simple toolkit. At the bookstore, this kit costs nearly $40 after tax, while online at Blick, an arts supply company, it costs a mere $15. 
USC can feel like a bubble, where the stores on campus are the only nearby options to grab a snack or pick up school supplies. Unfortunately, these convenient options are often the more expensive ones. The school estimates that the average student will spend an additional $20,000 above the yearly tuition price on things such as room and board, transportation and textbooks. 
However, it is possible to reduce this cost and keep in mind those students who are on a tight budget. Instead of giving an expensive and exclusive nail salon or state-of-the-art bike shop a space at the USC Village, perhaps the school could try to insert a locally-owned, more affordable used bike shop or bookstore. At the very least, the University cannot continue to upcharge prices under the guise of “convenience” without providing any alternative for those who cannot afford it.

The No. 1 USC women’s water polo team made a statement this weekend with a 17-2 win over California Baptist and a 25-2 win against Concordia at the Lancer Joust in Riverside. 
The victories set the tone for a Trojan team steadfast in defending its No. 1 ranking despite the loss of several players to Olympic training.
In Saturday morning’s match, the CBU Lancers opened the scoring with junior attacker Kira O’Donell finding the net on a power-play. 
It would be one of the last goals they saw for quite some time. All-American senior drivers Denise Mammolito and Kelsey McIntosh answered back for USC. The scoring only continued from there, with four other Trojans scoring later in the game.
After scoring 5 unanswered goals in the second period, the Trojans were up 8-1 heading into the second half. With just one more goal from CBU senior driver Katie Quon in the third, the Lancers struggled to a scoreless fourth allowing USC’s scoring tally to rise to 17. 
Starter redshirt junior goalie Holly Parker closed out the game with a .800 save percentage and just 2 goals allowed.
Even with the double-digit scoring, sophomore utility Bayley Weber, who scored 4 goals in the opener, noted that the 0.486 shooting percentage was in part due to nerves. 
“I think the first game was, you know, it’s the first game of our season,” Weber said. “We’re all excited to play and I think we came out with a lot of energy but we just couldn’t find the right passes — we were hitting the bars or throwing the ball at the goalie.”
While the Trojans maintained the same sort of defensive effort as in the previous game and improved their shooting, they saw a drop in goals from powerplays against Concordia. 
Redshirt freshman goalie Erin Tharp saw some playing time, allowing just 2 goals in the first half, and freshman Carolyne Stern also clocked in her first time as a Trojan with eight saves in the second, including a 5-meter penalty block. 
“I really like Carolyne’s attitude,”  head coach Marko Pintaric said after her performance. “She’s a very bright kid doing everything great in the training. She’s a student of the game, stays extra and asks the right questions, so I’m not surprised for her to be successful.”
The USC scoring drive was unstoppable with 6 or more goals per period and an overall shooting percentage of .758. The Trojans’ depth was a key factor with 11 players scoring. Freshman driver Téa Poljak, freshman driver Christina Crum and freshman utility Brooklyn Aguilera each picked up their first career goals as Trojans. 
“We missed high percentage opportunities [in the first game] and I think the coaches did a really good job in reinforcing that in our meeting after the game,” Weber said. “So when we came in the second game, we were more aware that not making those high percentage opportunities can lose us a championship.”
Despite the number of goals that USC was able to rack up in both games, there was still room for improvement in powerplays, with the Trojans scoring on 6 of 13 against CBU and 2 of 8 against Concordia. 
“If it wasn’t there the first time, it was going to be there the second time,” said Weber, who had 4 goals from power-plays across the two games. “So I think we held off taking those [shots] until it was clearly shown that we were going to make them.”
The Trojans will look to continue their winning streak at the UCLA Mini Tournament this weekend. USC will face LMU at 12:45 p.m. Saturday before a scrimmage against UCLA at 5:15 p.m.

Both the USC men’s and women’s tennis teams finished the Intercollegiate Tennis Association Kick-off Weekend strong this weekend at their respective tournaments.
The No. 3 men’s team booked its ticket to the ITA National Indoor Championships for the 12th straight year following a dominant performance at Marks Stadium over the weekend. On the other side, the No. 11 women’s team saw an encouraging weekend with a victory over Kentucky on day one of the tournament and a narrow loss to Princeton on day two. 
USC’s lineup included No. 1 ranked junior Daniel Cukierman, freshmen Stefan Dostanic and Ryder Jackson, sophomores No. 9 Mor Bulis and Bradley Frye and senior Riley Smith. The Trojans faced off against UNC Wilmington and Santa Clara University over the course of the two-day tournament.
USC started fast on day one. Cukierman and Smith captured a speedy 6-1 win over UNCW’s No. 36 pair of sophomore Bruno Caula and senior Daniel Groom. 
Meanwhile, on court three, Dostanic and Frye clinched USC’s first point with a 6-2 victory over Seahawks sophomores Dillon Gooch and Cole Groetsch.
In singles play, Jackson gave USC its second point of the day with a 6-3, 6-0 win over sophomore Davide Innocenti. The Trojans continued their dominant performance with two more wins from Frye, who cruised past UNCW senior Michael Copeland. Cukierman defeated redshirt senior Austin Hussey to seal the 4-0 sweep for day one’s action.
USC continued its hot start on day two with doubles duo Dostanic and Frye sweeping their opponents 6-0 to kick things off. Bulis and Jackson followed them up by securing another doubles victory to put USC ahead of Santa Clara 1-0. 
Frye continued his hot streak to give USC a 2-0 advantage in the first singles match. Bulis and Cukierman carried that momentum into their last matches of the day to cap things off quickly with two-set victories.
Head coach Brett Masi gave high praise to his players following Sunday’s 4-0 victory over Santa Clara.
“Bradley Frye had an excellent weekend,” Masi said. “His energy and presence on the court were affecting the whole team and I think that’s important when you play dual match … your positivity and energy among the team.” 
Masi also expressed his higher expectations for the team in upcoming matches.
“We’re playing against Stanford and Cal next weekend on the road — [we] know [our] level [of play] this weekend isn’t going to be good enough for that,” he said. “Next week we are going to focus on the small things and make some improvements.” 
The women’s side opened its ITA Kick-off Weekend with a thrilling 4-3 victory over Kentucky. Two doubles pairs got their job done by securing USC’s first point of the day to open play Saturday. 
Kentucky fought back in singles matches, leading 2-1 before USC senior captain Angela Kulikov notched her first singles win of the season to level things up 2-2. 
USC then took two out of the last three matches to secure a 4-3 win over the Wildcats on the first day. 
On Sunday, however, the Trojans lost their first dual match of the season, falling to Princeton 4-3 to finish off the weekend.
The USC men’s team will head to the Bay Area to play Stanford and Cal this weekend, while the women’s team will face St. Mary’s, UC Santa Barbara and Long Beach State in Los Angeles beginning Friday.

While future ‘Skin’s Spin’ columns will be about USC alumni in and around the world of sports, the first edition of this column must focus on a man who had no direct affiliation with the University, but who touched so many lives nonetheless.
The world is mourning the tragic loss of former Los Angeles Laker Kobe Bryant, along with his 13-year-old daughter Gianna and seven others onboard a helicopter that crashed into the hills of Calabasas Sunday morning. 
It is impossible to articulate just how much Kobe meant to the Lakers organization, the city of Los Angeles, the game of basketball and his admirers all over the world. To those of us who followed his career in the NBA and beyond, he epitomized excellence in everything he did — not only as an athlete, but as a role model. He was — and remains — perhaps more than any other person, my greatest inspiration for wanting to become a professional sports journalist.
My love and respect for Kobe was fostered before I became fully conscious. I grew up in Newport Beach, a suburban coastal town about an hour south of USC’s main campus. Like every town in Southern California, it is a Laker town. 
For my entire childhood and most of my adolescence, Kobe was the face of the Lakers and the NBA. The fact that Kobe is a hero of mine should come as a surprise to no one. 
My first memory of Kobe comes from Christmas morning in 2002. I remember my parents putting his No. 8 jersey over my head while my older brother toddled around in an oversized No. 34 Shaquille O’Neal jersey, mimicking Shaq’s thunderous slam dunks on the five-foot plastic hoop in our living room. Since then, Bryant has been a personal hero to me, and that admiration will remain — if not intensify — despite his early departure from our world.
With that said, I don’t believe I ever saw Kobe Bryant as just a basketball player. He and his family lived in a very expensive part of Newport Beach, so I would occasionally hear stories from friends who encountered him and his daughters in their local neighborhood. These stories humanized him. While Bryant’s greatness as a basketball player is ubiquitously known, what may be less obvious to some was his dedication to his wife, his daughters and his community.
After learning of the devastating news of his death, I reached out to friends from Newport and asked them to share their memories of the man, not the Lakers superstar.
Their stories paint a picture of a man deeply devoted to his wife and kids who sought and found relative normalcy despite his international fame. Even in the prime of his career, whether he was driving his daughters to and from school, serving hot lunches on ‘Taco Tuesdays’ or ‘Pizza Wednesdays’ in their school cafeteria, spending time with his family and friends at Catalina Island, joking around with his neighbors in line at the local supermarket or going to church on Sundays, he was a pillar of his community and his absence will be sorely missed by those who were fortunate enough to cross paths with him.
Bryant’s sudden passing leaves those of us who so fervently admired him with a tremendous feeling of emptiness and sadness — not only for losing him, Gianna and their fellow passengers far too soon, but also for his surviving daughters and wife who now have to find a way to move forward from this tragedy without their father and husband, sister and daughter.
While Kobe is no longer with us, he lives on in the hearts and minds of the millions that were dazzled by his talent and inspired by his example. While it is fair and right to take time to mourn the untimeliness of his death, we must keep his memory alive by appreciating him for all that he was. He surely would have given so much more to this world, but we must be grateful that he gave us all he could while he was here.
When discussing his legacy, Bryant once said, “It’s the one thing you can control. You are responsible for how people remember you — or don’t … So don’t take it lightly.”
Kobe Bryant will be remembered as not only a great athlete, but a gift of a man.
We ought to always remember his work ethic, his curiosity and willingness to ask questions, his relentless ambition, his fearlessness, his humor, his optimism, his professionalism, his eloquence, his love for his family and his commitment to striving for greatness on a daily basis. If we succeed in doing this, his legacy will continue to inspire many generations to come.

After the USC women’s basketball team started out its Pac-12 campaign with an 0-5 record, many questioned whether the young squad would be able to find its way in such a tough conference.
Since winning a pivotal overtime battle against No. 10 UCLA Jan. 17, though, the Trojans have proven that they can compete with any opponent they face. Sunday’s tough contest against Washington was another testament to that, as USC came from behind to defeat the Huskies 81-78 in overtime.
“We just had to come out and compete and play hard, and I think that’s what we did,” head coach Mark Trakh said. “Our young kids stepped up.”
USC fell to an early 9-0 deficit, which was only exacerbated in the second quarter as the Huskies shot 6 for 7 from behind the arc and rose to a 12-point lead by halftime. After the Trojans took 12 first-half 3-pointers and only converted on three, the game plan in the second half shifted toward getting to the basket and making the easy shots.
USC faced a well-rounded Washington attack all afternoon. Senior forward Mai-Loni Henson went 4 for 8 from distance, while senior guard Amber Melgoza led the team with 17 points.
The Trojans’ comeback effort was supported by an impressive cast of freshmen. Forward Alissa Pili had a double-double with 20 points and 14 rebounds, while guard Endyia Rogers scored a career-best 29 points, including 24 points scored after halftime.
The crowd erupted as Rogers stole a Washington pass and surged toward the basket, tying the game late in the third quarter.
“My freshmen are superstars, and I’ll live by that, I’ll stand by that,” sophomore guard Desiree Caldwell said of her younger teammates. “All of them are extremely experienced for their age and just play very mature … All of them score the ball and make really good decisions.”
Rogers said her hot hand was complemented by an increase in defensive energy from her teammates. The Trojans outscored the Huskies 22-11 in the third frame.
“It felt really exciting because we started going on a run, we started changing things up on defense, our defensive intensity picked up,” Rogers said.
In overtime, it looked to be anyone’s game until Caldwell nailed a crucial 3-pointer to give the Trojans a 4-point lead with just over a minute to go.
“Honestly, in the moment, I didn’t know the score,” Caldwell said. “I just knew Endyia had been working the whole game, and two people doubled down on her, and I knew it was my job to hit that shot.”
Caldwell said the team gained confidence from its recent double-overtime experience against UCLA that helped the players stay poised during the extra five minutes.
“I think it helped a lot,” she said. “When that five minutes reset, all of us just looked at each other and said, ‘We’ve been here before, let’s finish this game.’”
With the win, USC takes over the No. 8 spot in a highly competitive Pac-12 conference. The team’s three-game winning streak will be tested on a tough road trip against No. 16 Arizona State and No. 18 Arizona. 	
The Trojans lost to both schools earlier in January.
“[The win] feels good,” Trakh said. “It’s still going to be tough [on the road], we’ve got a young team. Both our leading scorers [today] were freshmen. We’re going to have our ups and downs.”
The Trojans will tip off against the Sun Devils at 10 a.m. Friday in Tempe, Ariz. before battling the Wildcats at 2 p.m. Sunday in Tucson.

While Los Angeles is home to some of the most diverse food vendors and restaurants, it’s not exactly the cheapest place to dine. As a student, it’s hard to explore the culturally rich food scene this city has to offer while also staying on a budget. DineL.A. just made it a little easier to overcome that financial hurdle. 
The dining affair, which ends Jan. 31, offers lunch and dinner menus from over 400 restaurants in the L.A. area. Lunch prices range from $15 to $35 and dinner options range from $29 to $99 for tasting menus.
Just go to any of the listed restaurants and ask them for their dineL.A. menu. You might want to book your reservation ahead of time as some of the restaurants tend to get pretty packed. The listed menu prices exclude taxes and gratuities, so you should definitely take that into account when looking at them. 
I’d recommend taking advantage of dineL.A. as much as you can. It’s only the third week of school, and for many of us the stress has already kicked in. A fancy meal could be your form of self-care, so find a restaurant you like, de-stress and enjoy a meal on a budget!
Here are two of my top restaurant recommendations for budget-conscious foodies. 
Located in the heart of L.A.’s Financial District, Harbor House serves New American cuisine and is accessible for USC students. To get there, use the DASH F bus, with stops located right next to the USC Village, and get off at 7th & Fig. Another option is to take the Expo Line and get off at 7th Street Metro. 
This is the perfect lunch spot, with its chic interior, its sophisticated ambience and its gorgeous views of downtown. I went at the height of the lunch rush hour and I got a table without too much difficulty. 
My friend and I started off with the French onion soup, which was the perfect balance of salty, cheesy and rich flavors. Next was the main dish: a salmon entrée with rice pilaf, lemon brown butter sauce and sauteed vegetables. The fish was a perfectly light and healthy meal, especially following the rich and hearty soup. While it didn’t have the wow-factor in terms of flavor, the dessert made up for it: a deep-fried twinkie with vanilla ice cream. It was absolutely divine, even though it wasn’t something you’d expect to follow a fish course. I love desserts which combine hot and cold foods, and the ode to a childhood staple hit the spot. 
You might have heard of this popular sushi spot located near The Last Bookstore downtown, and never got the chance to go because it’s sushi which is expensive. The KazuNori dineL.A. menu is well worth it, however, and is a nice break from the questionable packaged rolls found at Seeds Marketplace and Trojan Grounds on campus. 
The easiest way to get to the restaurant is by taking the Expo Line to 7th Street and then the Red Line to Pershing Square. From there, it’s just a short walk to the restaurant.
I went there on a Sunday and the line to get in was pretty long, with about a 30 minute waiting period. 
The restaurant presents a unique dining experience, where, instead of multiple tables, everyone is seated at one bar-style table, a layout perfect for anyone interested in wishing to dine alone. 
The first dish I ordered was the salmon sashimi. It came out of the kitchen very quickly and tasted heavenly. It was a fantastic, a perfectly cut, melt-in-your-mouth dish that set the bar high for the rest of the meal. 
The rest of the course consisted of three handrolls: the toro (also known as “fatty tuna”), cucumber and crab handrolls. Unlike the more standard bite-size sushi rolls that many of us are accustomed to, these rolls are palm sized and are mostly eaten by hand. The rolls were delightful and were some of the best I have had in L.A. The fish was top quality and the seaweed wrap had the perfect amount of crunch to it. What really stood out to me was the stickiness and quality of the rice, something often overlooked when reviewing sushi.

It’s noon on Sunday, Jan. 26, and I’m watching Twitter’s trending section. I refresh in disbelief as news of basketball legend Kobe Bryant’s death floods the internet. The word is spreading like a wildfire and the digital stages of grief are quickly set into motion. My shock and denial are followed by anger and pain. 
Before his death, my column had nothing to do with Bryant. Nevertheless, sitting here in front of my laptop, it feels trivial to write about anything else. What unfolded before my eyes sent shockwaves through entire communities and will likely challenge our conceptions of fame, death and the way these concepts interact in the public eye.
Bryant, 41, and his 13-year-old daughter Gianna, were among nine people killed in a helicopter crash that morning. 
Only 17 when drafted to the Lakers, the youngest player in the league’s history at the time, Bryant quickly grew to become a legend. In his lifetime he won five NBA titles with the Lakers, two NBA Finals MVP awards and was an 18-time All-Star eligible for the Basketball Hall of Fame. 
His influence was just as tangible off the court. He was a cultural icon, as evidenced by Chief Keef’s “Kobe” and other shoutouts by prolific hip-hop stars, his multiple TV and film cameos and Oscar-winning short “Dear Basketball.” 
His fans saw him on posters in their bedrooms, on their living room televisions and mentioned him in their dinner-table conversations. Behind the tough-love “Mamba Mentality,” Bryant never cut corners, never made excuses. And he did everything in his power to use that mindset to strengthen and elevate young people across the globe. It is clear that this loss is already being felt in a big way: Producer and singer Pharell Williams expressed that the “world lost a giant today” and Leonardo Dicaprio declared “L.A. will never be the same.” 
But I’m not writing this article to tell you what happened — by the time it runs, you will have likely read every detail, a dozen times over. I’m writing this to ask a question that even I don’t have the answer to: At a time when public figures can reach an unprecedented level of global influence, what are the cultural ramifications when someone so embedded in the heart of the nation passes?
Thanks to improved technology and communication, we have the luxury of experiencing celebrities at unforeseen levels. We can follow their digital trail as they move through the world, creating a sense of intimacy that is counterintuitive to their untouchable nature. 
We immortalize their image and their legacy at every turn, and we thus come to see them as much more infallible than they are. Then, on a day like Sunday, we are forced to face the chilling reality that death waits for no man — and it’s terrifying.
It was felt in the accidental overdoses of hip-hop stars Mac Miller and Juice WLRD. It was felt in the unexpected murder of Nipsey Hussle, who was shot outside his Los Angeles store last March. Now, it is felt in the loss of Bryant, and the damage will span far and wide. He lived not vertically, but horizontally; he was not just a household name in basketball — he was a household name, period, his influence cutting across industries and generations.
I believe deaths like Bryant’s, deaths of those we see as invulnerable, challenge our conceptions of humanity in a big way. It is no surprise that shock and incredulity will permeate the circumstances surrounding his death. The communities he touched will not process their loss hastily. On a quiet Sunday morning in Calabasas, a helicopter went down, and Bryant, one of the greatest of all time, went down with it. 
I’m watching tweet after tweet saying, “this can’t be real” and “I can’t believe this.” Certainly, these reactions are appropriate, even expected. But I think we are scared, scared that even with legacy and prowess in your grasp, you can still die without warning.  
As Horace once said, “Pale death beats equally at the poor man’s gate and at the palaces of kings.”
 Although my sentiment is grim, as we experience these public figures more closely and personally than ever before, the way we experience their deaths is different, too. I believe this is a culturally defining moment, one that challenges our perceptions of fame and infallibility, and reflects on our interconnectedness. This is a piece of history that, like Bryant himself, will cut horizontally across the social fabric of a nation. 
Before I sign off, I want to share a thought: When you take a shot you think you’ll never make, you yell, “Kobe!” His trademark was making the impossible possible, and while death waits for no man, I’d like to believe legends never really die.

Committee to Protect Journalists executive director Joel Simon highlighted the misuse of the phrase “fake news” and provided words of encouragement about surpassing the negativity in journalism to an audience of more than 30 people at Wallis Annenberg Hall Monday. 
CPJ, a nonprofit organization that advocates for freedom of the press, ensures journalists worldwide feel safe doing their job. Since 1992, the organization has collected data about the number of journalists imprisoned and killed globally. 
Recently, there has been an increase in the number of journalists jailed around the world as leaders use the term “fake news” to undermine their work. Simon referenced CCTV by the Chinese government and various state-funded media outlets has been used to influence the public.
“We’re seeing leaders around the world adopt this rhetoric to justify repressing the media,” Simon said. “We’re seeing fake news laws promulgated around the world, basically criminalizing certain kinds of reporting. What’s completely missing is U.S. engagement.” 
The U.S. has not presented the field of journalism in a positive light. Simon referred to President Donald Trump’s recent statement questioning the need for NPR after radio host Mary Louise Kelly reported being disrespected by Secretary of State Mike Pompeo after an interview. Simon called the situation “fundamentally damaging” to the First Amendment because President Trump fails to represent the values of America as the chief diplomat. 
He also mentioned the Facebook data privacy scandal in which Facebook founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg answered questions about the social media platform’s promulgation of Russian-influenced ads in the 2016 election. Simon uses this scandal as an example to reiterate how influential corporations fail to address the challenges faced by journalists. 
“[Facebook’s change was] an ass-covering strategy,” Simon said. “It’s a way for them to step back a little bit because of something that was capable of political liability for them. There’s been some efforts to address this but no commitment from leadership.” 
In response to an audience question, Simon gave recommendations on handling “fake news.” He advised audience members to use the term only in the context of recent government justification for threats against journalists. Simon also said that frequent use of this term only led to its exploitation.
“First thing I’d recommend is don’t use the term ,” Simon said. “It’s meaningless.”
He also discussed the influence of technology in daily life and the way these technological advancements are becoming a threat to privacy. Simon said that it seems impossible to verify the safety behind our means of communication.
Judy Muller, an ABC News correspondent and professor emeritus, asked if the CPJ had plans to educate the public on media literacy due to the gross misrepresentation of journalists.
Simon said CPJ recognizes that the public struggles with media literacy but said the committee sees a greater need to allocate its resources to their expertise.
Alyssa Patterson, a graduate student studying global communication who attended the event, said she appreciated the global perspective it provided. Patterson found the conversation to be eye opening because she saw how other governments were abusing journalism and saw that the situation was “not just a Trump disease.” 
Simon said the number of journalists killed last year was the lowest since 1992. He also mentioned a collaboration with USC to host a press freedom film festival, which would feature panels, discussions and screenings to recognize efforts toward press freedom. 
“The thing that inspires me, makes me do this job, is how difficult and dangerous journalism is, and yet there is so much incredible journalism in this country, around the world,” Simon said.

Since August, Provost Charles Zukoski’s office has been home to vibrant paintings of still life and portraits. They’re pieces from throughout senior Brian Dinh’s art career, ranging from his high school artwork to the end of his senior year of college.
Each academic year, a representative from the provost’s team chooses a student’s art exhibit from the USC Fisher Museum of Art to be featured in their office, taking great care in deciding which art will be displayed and choosing a piece that will send a positive message to students on the importance of displaying student artwork and appreciating the work of USC students.
“We [were] looking for pieces that are relevant, dynamic and empowering: Brian Dinh’s artwork embodies all of those elements and more,” Zukoski wrote in an email statement to the Daily Trojan.
Zukoski endorsed the decision to display a student’s artwork. He said he feels that it adds value to the office by showcasing the artistic skills of USC students.
“As an institution, our museums are recognized as having the best standards and practices when it comes to attracting and exhibiting the finest artwork in the world,” Zukoski said. “I believe it’s equally important to curate artwork from our own student artists.”
Dinh, a senior majoring in fine arts with an emphasis in oil painting, had his first oil painting “Dream Beam” featured in Zukoski’s office. The painting depicts a boat on the water’s surface with fish swimming underneath the surface of the flowing water.
Dinh said that having the first artwork he’s created on display was bittersweet since the work represents a stage of his artistic journey that has come to a close as he has begun to “loosen” his artistic style.
“It’s a work that encapsulates the beginning of something that I’m moving away from,” Dinh said. “I don’t produce that kind of work anymore. So does that mean my work is less valuable [compared to today’s work]?”
Zukoski said the decision to have a student’s work displayed in his office comes from a desire to represent their student body and their ability to create unique pieces of art.
“I am instantly inspired when I come into my office and see student artwork,” Zukoski said. “It serves as a daily reminder for why I am here — for why we as faculty members are all here. It’s to support these brilliant students of ours.”
In addition, Zukoski hopes the artwork will send a message to students that the work they create holds value.
“Art is essential to education: It creates a culture of thought that moves, inspires and transforms people,” Zukoski said. “Contemporary art created by our own students at this very specific time in history has something to say about our current culture and world, and I think it’s worth listening to by placing it in our offices, schools and maybe even someday our museums.”
Dinh, who will graduate in May, currently works as an office administrator at the Fisher Museum of Art — an experience that he said has piqued his curiosity about museum operation.
As for Dinh’s future plans post-college, he hopes to continue pursuing art but wants to change his field of interest. 
“I will have a departure from the art fields … and head into more behind the scenes in terms of operations because I am fond of the organizational systems,” Dinh said. “But I may start leaning into more PR and e-commerce stuff, which I previously did this past summer in textile fashion production.”
Dinh felt that the biggest setback for him artistically is that many students in his art classes tend to be from non-art majors and are in the class to relax, while Dinh himself is passionate about the subject. 
“I went to a performing arts high school, so everyone there pretty much had their own gifts to bring to the table,” Dinh said. “[At USC] I feel like the disparity between that has been a setback in terms of challenging yourself creatively when there’s not a lot of people who feel as creative as you do.”

Students and faculty crowded around Tommy Trojan Monday bearing posters with slogans like “No time for fossil fools” and “I refuse to pay for a college that won’t be here long enough for me to graduate” to protest USC’s role in advancing climate change through their investments in fossil fuels.
More than 100 students attended the Divest SC Rally hosted by Environmental Core and the Environmental Student Assembly, which was co-sponsored by nine other programming boards in the Undergraduate Student Government, including the Latinx Student Assembly, the Queer and Ally Student Assembly and the Black Student Assembly. 
Organizers planned the strike after sending a letter to President Carol Folt in December demanding that USC disclose details of its $5 billion endowment, specifically its investments in fossil fuels. 
In response to the December letter, Folt’s office reached out this week to the Divest SC Rally organizers to coordinate a day to speak with students about their demands and questions regarding divestment. 
“From the moment I arrived [at USC], I received questions about [divestment],” Folt wrote in a statement to the Daily Trojan. “At the time I said it was important to me, but not something I could tackle in my first semester given other demands. I’m speaking with members of the Investment Committee and will be meeting with students … later this month.”
Tianna Shaw-Wakeman, co-organizer and Environmental Core representative, started the protest by telling students they didn’t need to know the details of investing to understand its impact on younger generations.
“If you understand that investing in fossil fuels is investing in human suffering, is investing in us not having a future, that’s all you need to know [in that] USC must … make our futures better, must divest,” Shaw-Wakeman said.
ESA co-director Nathaniel Hyman led the crowd through chants of “Divest! Divest! It’s in our best interest!” and reminded attendees about the growing number of studies showing how little time is left to reverse the effects of climate change. 
Hyman called out world leaders and USC administration for expecting individuals to make their own sustainability efforts when the fossil fuel industry accounts for 76% of the carbon emissions in the United States. 
“The University has been telling you to turn off your AC and use a fan to save energy, has told you to carry around a metal straw, has told you that climate change is a wicked problem,” Hyman said. “And has also been telling its investment office to invest in coal, natural gas and petroleum oil.”
As sounds from the rally echoed throughout Trousdale Parkway, ESA co-director Claire Mauss addressed the crowd in English and Spanish. She informed the crowd that more than half of people of color live within 30 miles of an oil rig, which seriously affects their health in the long run. 
“People of color are way more affected by problems with pollution and their health,” Mauss said. “When we fight for ourselves, we’re not just fighting for us, we’re fighting for our entire community. It’s really important that we remember that we’re not just these privileged students fighting for divestment, we are fighting for something that is bigger than all of us.”
Protest leaders encouraged students to add their personal stories to the dialogue by voting, lobbying and spreading awareness about climate change. 
Jenni Hunting, a freshman majoring in international relations and environmental studies, said she attended the rally to protest the University’s investment in an industry that could threaten her future.
“For me, it’s just holding USC accountable to their sustainability promise because … all over campus, I see signs saying, ‘We’re a sustainable campus, zero waste!’ and frankly, it’s bullshit if we’re continuing to invest in fossil fuels,” Hunting said. 
Hyman ended the event by reminding students that in order to enact real change, the school needs to know that these issues matter to the student body as a whole, not just a select few. He also let attendees know that President Folt plans to meet with the coordinators of the event later this week to discuss the University’s potential divestment from the fossil fuel industry and reinvestment in renewable energy.
“At the end of the day … I believe [Folt] is conscious of the issue, and I believe what she needs is a legitimization both to her and the Board of Trustees that these demands are legitimate, they’re profitable and they have precedence in other countries and other institutions,” Hyman said. “We just need to keep on making our case.”
