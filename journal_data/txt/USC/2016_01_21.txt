In their 2016 home opener, the No. 15 Trojans played a close match against the No. 9 UCSB Gauchos. but lost in four sets, 22-25, 25-23, 22-25 and 23-25.
“I thought we finally put together some good stretches of volleyball, but we still have to be able to perform at every point from beginning to end,” said head coach Jeff Nygard.
In the first set, the Trojans fell behind 15-12 before working it back to 17-17 after a Tommy Leonard kill. Although he and outside hitter Lucas Yoder would both finish with four kills in the set, the momentum swung back to the Gauchos who would close out 25-22.
In the second set, despite dismal Gaucho hitting at .094, USC got off to an equally slow start and took a timeout to regroup after falling behind 9-6. Upon returning to the court, the Trojans fought for a 20-19 lead before a Gauchos’ timeout. Subsequently, four critical Gaucho errors down the stretch cost them the set which went to the Trojans, 25-23.
In the middle of the third set, Lucas Yoder caught fire, recording seven kills in the next sixteen match points. His effort did not keep the Trojans ahead as UCSB hit .500 in the set with 20 kills, including eight from junior opposite Matt Marsh whose impressive individual effort sparked a 10-7 Gaucho run to win the set 25-22.
Captain and senior outside hitter Alex Slaught liked the way his team played.
“If anything, we just need to close games,” he said.
Slaught pointed out that the Trojans “started playing a little hesitant in the long rallies” that gave the Gauchos unstoppable momentum in the fourth.
Though the Men of Troy opened the fourth fearlessly with an early 9-6 run, the Gauchos responded with a 5-1 run and never looked back, committing zero attack errors the rest of the way to close out the fourth and final set 25-23.
The Trojans fell behind at one point in all four sets and blew a five-point lead in the fourth, but Nygaard remains “encouraged by the fact that our guys are putting it together.”
One sign of this improvement was Josh Kirchner’s breakout performance highlighted by eight kills and a .571 hitting percentage. His game is a sign that the team is maturing incredibly quickly in the early season, and as Nygaard said, “raising the expectations has been part of what we’ve been doing.”
Saturday night the Trojans will need to defy expectations as they face crosstown rival UCLA for the first time since clinching an MPSF Tourney berth against them with a five-set victory at the Galen Center late last season. At that time, the Trojans were ranked No. 9 nationally and the Bruins were at No. 12, and while USC would finish the year at 19-9, UCLA would slide below .500 at 13-14.
This year, however, the table has turned. USC is off to a poor start while UCLA has ascended to No. 1 in the nation with a perfect 6-0 record including quality wins versus both Ohio St. and Penn St., top ten programs that conquered the Trojans early in January.
Indeed, the Trojans’ tumultuous start has left many questions unanswered. Understandably, they have struggled to fill the void left by graduating senior setter Micah Christenson, a two-time First-Team All-American, three-year team captain, and 4-year starter.
For sophomore setter Jack Yoder, the team is generating energy as a unit.
“We’re all super excited to get into Westwood and play [the Bruins],” Yoder said. “We have a lot to prove and this is a great opportunity for us.”
And for junior libero Vinnie Rios the team carries over enough experience from previous years to feel “comfortable” at Pauley.
“We’ve been playing against these guys for years now, so there’s nothing from this team we haven’t seen,” Rios said. “Rankings aside, we know what we have to do to win, so it’s just [a matter of] going and getting the job done.”
Nygaard, who was a star player for the Bruins, had one thing to say about returning to Pauley Pavilion.
“When I was there, my team learned how to win, and we intend to do the same,” Nygaard said.
What was the point of hiring Nygaard who was with Ferguson for a few years, and part of the problem. The recruiting has
suffered since Micah C. which was four years ago. It would be appreciated in covering the sport that you would update
the status of two main starters who are injured, Andy Benesh and Mike Mullaley. Team would be better for sure with those
two players.

In two days, the New England Patriots will play the Denver Broncos, and the Arizona Cardinals will face the Carolina Panthers for the right to play in the Super Bowl. Once again, an insane amount of Americans will gather around their television sets to participate in the weekly ritual of watching Sunday afternoon football.
It’s a little funny sometimes, the fact that a sport scientifically linked to brain damage remains undoubtedly the most popular and highest-rated of the four major American sports.
We are too quick to forget and ignore, and all it takes is something as simple as another spectacular Aaron Rodgers Hail Mary or Blair Walsh brutally missing a chip shot to lose a playoff game. Moments like these are what make sports great and keep us tuning in for game after game.
That’s not the problem. The problem is the strange hypocrisy that watching football presents: we know that there is a link between the sport and brain disease, yet we still come out in droves to drive up ratings and buy tickets, jerseys and other merchandise, supporting a league that has been unbelievably incompetent in addressing a potentially life-threatening issue.
Last September, a Boston University study found that 131 of 165 brains of deceased football players contained chronic traumatic encephalopathy, a degenerative brain disease. And while the general public has become somewhat more vigilant in the harm of playing football since such studies have been released, the overall response has been underwhelming.
Take, for example, the movie Concussion, starring Will Smith as Dr. Bennet Omalu, the Nigerian doctor who first discovered CTE when he conducted an autopsy on Pittsburgh Steelers’ star Mike Webster. The film had all the makings of a potential game changer in terms of changing public perception: a megastar playing the main role, a made-for-Hollywood plot in the incredible journey of Omalu and the takedown of a big corporation in the NFL. Trailers for the movie were everywhere, even airing during football games.
It turns out the film was far from a blockbuster. In its opening weekend, Concussion only finished seventh in box office returns, accruing just $11 million and finishing behind movies like Daddy’s Home, a comedy with a 30 percent rating on Rotten Tomatoes, and Alvin and the Chipmunks: The Road Chip – yes, even Alvin and the Chipmunks. More people paid to watch a movie about animated rodents than the NFL ignoring a degenerative brain disease in its sport.
Why is that? Do we just simply not care? Perhaps football has been too deeply embedded in American culture that it will take much more than a movie or scientific studies to reverse its popularity.
The Bengals-Steelers playoff game a couple of weeks ago serves as proof. The Steelers won a narrow, thrilling, violent contest that featured $145,000 worth of fines for several altercations and unsportsmanlike conduct penalties, most notably Bengals linebacker Vontaze Burfict leveling a dangerous hit to the head of a defenseless receiver in the Steelers’ Antonio Brown, which knocked Brown unconscious and concussed him. Yet, we kept watching because it was a close game in the playoffs, fully aware that Brown could have very well suffered brain damage as a direct result of that hit.
Sports Illustrated columnist Richard Deitsch penned this perfect reaction to the game: “It was equal parts compelling, dirty, unwatchable, violence-filled, magnificent … and you could not take your eyes off the screen … I felt both enthralled and guilty at the same time as I watched the carnage in front of me. I wanted to look away. I could not look away.”
I like football as a form of entertainment because it is exciting and intense, as any sport should be. But I watch it with a grain of salt. Instead of “oohing and aahing” at a big hit like I used to, I wince and wonder if that hit will have lasting ramifications on that player’s long-term health.
Smith, a well-known Eagles fan, feels the same way after portraying Dr. Omalu in Concussion.
“I haven’t seen a whole game,” he said to Yahoo!. “It’s really stressful now. It definitely created a conflict for me. It’s still beautiful, it’s still America’s favorite game. That doesn’t change at all. It just has another side, that once you see and once you know and once you understand, you can’t not see.”
That is the quandary I face whenever I watch a football game. I know I am supporting an industry that has repeatedly denied and tried to cover up its link to traumatic, life-altering brain disease. Yet, as the hypocrisy goes, I can’t turn away. So when the Patriots and Broncos kick off on Sunday at noon — Brady vs. Manning, anyone? — and when USC football opens its season this fall in a primetime matchup against reigning national champion Alabama in Arlington, I will be watching, along with everyone else.

A new partnership between the Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism and the Viterbi School of Engineering aims to form an interdisciplinary program that will foster an environment for students to become successful as communication technology professionals.
The collaboration consists of two elements, a new joint degree as well as innovation teams combining students from both schools. The master of communications informatics joint degree evaluates the impact technology has had on the future of communication. The degree will look at aspects ranging from data analytics, crowdsourcing, social media, online communities and the use of technology in journalism.
Craig Knoblock, the associate director of informatics in Viterbi, said that he wants joint degrees to be a major focus for the future of the school since students often want to apply what they learn in Viterbi to different industries.
“Our vision in informatics is that future programs will focus on joint degrees that span information and informatics in multiple disciplines, that’s really where the meat is,” Knoblock said. “People want to learn about the computer science aspect of things and understand how to apply it to multiple fields.”
Last week’s press release also discussed the new innovation teams as part of the new Annenberg Leadership Initiative. Funded by a portion of the $5 million gift from the Annenberg Foundation, the teams aim to provide a opportunity for students of both disciplines to pioneer new methods of creative storytelling. Students will work in the new Julie Chen/Leslie Moonves and CBS Media Center to form new methods of delivering news.
Michael Cody, a professor of social influence processes within Annenberg, is one of the main individuals behind the creation of this new program.
“We decided to start a small exclusive program,” Cody said. “We’re expecting around 10 to 12 people at the beginning. We want people who are interested in combining algorithms, computer science and tracking, who are looking for the best way of comparing and showing similarities between profiles of people.”
Whether a student is working from the engineering or communication side, the overall objective of the program surrounds the concept of harnessing technology to implement change in our society and guide it in a more positive direction.
“We celebrate this new, powerhouse partnership and everything it will bring to both schools and our graduates,” said Ernest J. Wilson III, dean of USC Annenberg in a press release.
Austin Roy, a masters student studying communication management at Annenberg, thinks this collaboration will provide students involved with the unique advantage of having skillsets to succeed in both sides of this evolving industry.
“I think it’s essential for communication students to understand the value of technology and for technology students to understand the value of communication,” Roy said. “Although both fields may seem polarly opposite, without each other their individual messages won’t be heard.”
Danny Cantwell, a masters student studying computer science at Viterbi, agrees.
“I’ve worked on a lot of engineering projects where students have a lot of different expectations, and even though they have a deep understanding of the technical side of things, Annenberg students have a better understanding of the more communicative elements of a project and would be able to really help in that aspect,” Cantwell said.
Cody discussed some potential projects that could come out of a program like this, such as artificial intelligence systems that could be used to help kids with autism.
“It may be that artificial intelligence systems could be worked with tablets to help these kids, so when they’re working with computers and you read that they’re unhappy or having vocal stress you’d then modify the system so that it adapts to their needs and concerns,” Cody said. “That’s something I’ve dreamt about for decades; in communication, we don’t have that access but now it’s possible.”
The program is set to start admitting students this fall.

As the Feb. 1 Iowa caucus looms closer and closer, student political organizations are gearing up for their Olympics, one where polls are measured instead of jumps and performance-enhancing caffeine is encouraged during late night campaign work.
Reza Talieh helps run USC Students for Rand Paul, a group that was recognized as a student organization last November. Talieh said effectively finding like-minded supporters can be difficult.
“Someone like Sen. Rand Paul, you run into this situation where we try  to tail down people who would have supported his father [former U.S. Representative Ron Paul], and you run into this loop where people will refer me to their friends but eventually it comes into a full circle, and they’re referring me to each other’s friends. After that you’ve got to share the message,” Talieh said.
To escape this closed loop, Talieh attends auxiliary events including Incarceration Nation, an event that protests the drug war, in the attempt of finding like-minded potential supporters.
Another issue that he faces is the reputation Paul has as an “isolationist” when it comes to foreign policy. Talieh said that he would prefer the term “non-interventionist” instead.
Whereas Talieh tries to avoid mentioning this, the issue of reputation is often the first one that USC Students for Bernie Sanders addresses, says sophomore Ryan Lopez, president of the organization.
“One of the things we do is explain that Bernie Sanders is democratic socialist, and the difference between that and socialism,” Lopez said.
In order to be more efficient in their campaigning efforts, USC Students for Bernie Sanders participates in phone banking to pare down and focus on the residences that are receptive to the campaign.
“The campaign emphasizes person-to-person contact,” Lopez said.
Phone banking is also an important feature of the Rand Paul campaign. Talieh says the group can make around 300 calls in a few hours.
USC Students for Bernie Sanders live tweet alongside Bernie Sanders during the Republican debates, and form watch parties during the Democratic debates.
On-campus efforts are not limited to simple tabling. The USC College Republicans have made various efforts to engage students on campus, passing out “Hillary Wipes,” computer screen cleaners intended to satirize the email server scandal that Hillary Clinton has been criticized for the last several months. The organization also made a cake representing the national debt, making divisions that amounted to $56,000 a slice. Far from being intimidated by the amount of candidates vying for the presidency, USC College Republicans President Jacob Ellenhorn sees it as an opportunity to find the truly suitable candidate.
“Democrats only have one choice, Hillary Clinton,” Ellenhorn said.
On Jan. 12, these issues and others like it were brought into a public forum. The Jesse M. Unruh Institute of Politics, in conjunction with the Daily Trojan and the USC Political Student Assembly, held a screening of the State of the Union address, followed by a discussion panel including campaign experts and USC students. Deputy Director of the Unruh Institute Ali Bissonnette says it is events like this that are key to the institute’s goal of civic engagement.
“We try to focus our energy on big crowd events that will get a good turnout,” Bissonnette said.
These events include the Iowa caucus on Feb. 1, the New Hampshire primary and Super Tuesday, in which 14 states and one territory — American Samoa — hold either their caucus or primary election. The aim of this lunch series is to foster bipartisan dialogue.
“We want people to leave with an understanding of the other side of the argument, and to say ‘I get that perspective. I may not agree with it, but I understand it,’” Bissonnette said.
In addition to helping curate these landmark events in the 2016 election cycle, the Unruh Institute has also focused on encouraging student civic engagement by holding voter registration on campus. In the first semester, the institute was able to register 549 students and is planning on another registration drive this coming April. The institute also plans to try and help establish polling stations on campus to ensure that voting is easy as possible for USC students.

Mark S. Humayun, director of the USC Institute for Biomedical Therapeutics and a professor of ophthalmology at the Keck School of Medicine of USC and biomedical engineering at the Viterbi School of Engineering, is one of eight scientists to receive the National Medal of Technology and Innovation from U.S. President Barack Obama.
In a statement from the White House, Obama recognized the achievements of Humayun and the other honorees.
“The knowledge produced by these Americans today will carry our country’s legacy of innovation forward and continue to help countless others around the world,” Obama said.
Established by Congress in 1980 and first awarded in 1985, the National Medal of Technology and Innovation is awarded to individuals, teams or companies that strengthen U.S. competitiveness through improving the technological workforce.
Winners of the national medal are first nominated for review by an evaluation committee appointed by the secretary of commerce. The vetted nominees are then turned over to the secretary, who makes the final recommendations to the President for his selection.
Humayun, the third Trojan to be awarded the honor after Allen Puckett in 1985 and George Lucas in 2004, has won global acclaim for his leading role in developing Argus II, a retinal eye implant that assists those with retinitis pigmentosa in regaining key features of their vision.
Humayun is widely respected by his colleagues at the Keck School of Medicine of USC. Rohit Varma, Humayun’s successor as the director of the USC Eye Institute, is particularly proud of his co-worker’s achievements.
“One of the reasons the USC Eye Institute has been ranked in the top 10 ophthalmology departments in the U.S. is because of innovative scientists like Mark who guide and inspire us,” Varma said. “It is a privilege to have him as a colleague at the USC Eye Institute.”
Humayun, the only ophthalmologist to be a member of both the National Academy of Medicine and the National Academy of Engineering, follows a personal hero of his, Charles Kelman, in being a recipient of the National Medal. Awarded the Medal in 1992, Kelman revolutionized cataract surgery by introducing ultrasound instruments that dramatically reduced recovery time for patients.
When asked if he had advice for USC students planning their future careers, Humayun stressed the importance of finding a passion.
“If you love the things you do, you will want to do them right away, and you will want to do them well,” Humayun said. “For me, developing bioelectronic implants for medicine and, in particular, ophthalmology is a passion, and I love my work and hence, I hardly ever procrastinate.”
 
Editor’s Note: This post was updated to reflect that Mark Humayun is a professor in both the Keck School of Medicine of USC and the Viterbi School of Engineering.

In their third album Moth, synthpop duo Chairlift explores dance vibes through upbeat melodies and synths layered with strong drum beats. Moth is an evolution of Chairlift’s prior 2012 album, Something, showing the group’s versatility used in making a strong, pop-inspired album.
Moth is weird, but it’s also the ultimate heartfelt album, hyperfocusing on that special someone and longing for an unrequited love. Each track is cohesive with one another, making it symbiotic in its entirety. It took a few times to get used to the album because of how in-your-face each song is, but with singles like, “Ch-Ching” and “Romeo,” this album had more ups than downs.
Through a jazzy approach, accompanied with tribal beats and a bit of sensual ’80s sounding vocals, Moth is definitely different from Chairlift’s prior discography. If one were to morph St. Vincent with the likings of HAIM, then you’ve got Chairlift’s lead singer Caroline Polachek vocalizing over funky and psychedelic instrumentals.
Chairlift should receive credit for taking a cliché love story and making it their own. Each song shows some similarity, making it cohesively strong in instrumentals and in vocals, and though similar, each track had its own spin, whether it with the use of synth horns or Japanese instruments.
There is a subtle variation of all types of sounds going on throughout the album. From drum rolls in “Unfinished Business” and a little bit of saxophone “Polymorphing,” to oriental-themed sounds in “Ottawa to Osaka,” these fragmented instrumentals show an added innovativeness to each track. With this, each track successfully fits together like puzzle pieces. Along with this, Polachek has a strong range in her voice and she is able to showcase this from start to finish. Along with that is an element of repetitiveness throughout the whole album that is only able to work well because of Polacheck’s lyrics and versatility in her voice.
Some favorites from Moth include “Polymorphing” and “Moth to the Flame.” The overall album is meant for one big dance party and the essential soundtrack to have while chasing after the love of your life. To conclude the 10-track album, Chairlift closes with “No Such Thing.” This song specifically demonstrates a softer angle than the previous tracks but holistically wraps up the album in an eloquent way.

Los Angeles boasts some of the most renowned art collections in the world. The exhibits housed in the MOCA, LACMA and The Broad museums highlight pieces from famed international artists such as German photographer Thomas Struth. Such works mirror the ethnic diversity that can be seen walking down any street in Los Angeles. John McCracken’s “Planks” have long been associated with a uniquely Los Angeles perspective as their polished, lacquered surfaces that resemble L.A. staples such as cars and surfboards, lean casually against the wall to contribute to the impression of a detached California cool, while a temporary exhibit at the LACMA reveals the arduous and contemplative process of USC graduate Frank Gehry, who used technology to have more direct relationships with his models and sketches, many of which are on display. Here are some museums to consider:
The Museum of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles
This contemporary art exhibit can be viewed in a clockwise fashion as the works are organized in chronological order from the time they were conceived. With roughly 7,000 works already, the museum grows annually through purchases from patrons and artists within the Los Angeles community making up 90 percent of its works. If you start the museum on the left, you will walk though rooms that are arranged loosely around historical art movements starting in the 1940s and ending in the 1980s such as abstract expressionism, pop art, conceptual art and feminism. The many interactive and culturally provocative installations allow the viewer the ability to compare how such movements reflect the political, cultural and socioeconomic happenings of that time period. The fact that one is directed to view the art in a certain way suggests that the entire gallery is meant to be immersive, as strong clashing colors, eclectic subject matters and wide varieties of media, emphasize a self-reflexive experience that curator Helen Molesworth said, “Fosters a dialogue between the art objects themselves as well as between the artworks and the viewer.”
Conversely, this ability to compare the histories of these artistic styles teaches the viewer that contemporary art seeks to remove the hand of the author from the piece and tries to instill the impactful emotions one is supposed to feel from art through seemingly elementary yet relatable installations, such as Cy Twombly’s “Blackboard Series” in which he drew a whirling loop in white crayon on a grey painted canvas that perhaps implies that the artist is a student and not a master. This can similarly be seen in the wonderful room dedicated to the paintings by Marc Rothko who wanted his viewers to stand close to his works, so that they would have their vision flooded by luminous colors to create an atmospheric space of primitive emotions, shying away from grandiose representations that could indicate a wrongful and political motivation in art.
The Los Angeles County Museum of Art
The LACMA celebrated its 50th birthday last year with 120,000 pieces in its collections that makes it the largest art museum in the western United States. Though the permanent exhibit houses works of abstract expressionism from famed artists such as Picasso,  Miro and  Magritte, among the museums’ strengths are its collections of Asian, Latino and Islamic art ranging from the pre-Columbian masterpieces to works by the leading modern and contemporary international artists. Two notable temporary exhibits are the “Rain Room” and “Frank Gehry” as they both reflect on the LACMA’s dedication to represent the interactive art scene of Los Angeles. The “Rain Room” by Random International is an immersive environment that offers the viewers the seemingly impossible ability to control rain and not get wet while walking through it. Though continuous rain comes down the top of the exhibit like a shower, the light sensors on the sides of the room detect your presence and signify the top not to exert water if there is someone under it. Therefore, they use science and technology to create an experience that aims to question the human existence within a machine world, engaging viewers through explorations of behavior and reactions to this natural phenomenon. Additionally, the Frank Gehry exhibit gives viewers the chance to get a taste of the Los Angeles architect’s revolutionary design process that continues to capture the heterogeneous nature of Angelenos and people everywhere. The exhibit that traces the full arc of the architect’s career contains many original models, designs and drawings that distinguished him as an urbanist, evidenced in his familiar local works such as his residence in Santa Monica and Walt Disney Concert Hall in downtown Los Angeles. The exhibit that highlights his unique usage of CATIA (Computer Aided Three Dimensional Interactive Application), a software tool used in the aeronautics and automobile industries, to create his models and generated new methods, technologies and approaches to sculpting his material. The exhibit demonstrates how Gehry questions a building’s very means of expression, as he has sought to distance architecture from its historical conventions and contend with the avant-garde art movement.
The Broad
The two-hour long wait to receive onsite tickets to enter this new postwar and contemporary art exhibit serves as an indication of the strength of the Los Angeles art scene. With its innovative “veil and vault” concept, the 120,000-square-foot, $140 million building features two floors of gallery space to showcase the Broad’s comprehensive collection of 2,000 artworks by more than 200 artists that chief curator Joanne Heyler says, “is a result of a sustained and intensive engagement with art and artists that reflects many of the forces and ideas that have shaped art since the mid-20th century.”  Arranged chronologically, the crowded installation begins on the top-floor galleries with icons of American postwar art, mainly 1960s pop art from artists such as Jeff Koons, as seen in his depiction of balloon animals, to key works of the 1980s New York art scene from Jean-Michel Basquiat and Keith Haring, to art from the 2000s that depicts the happenings of the present like Takashi Murakami’s works that reflect the 2011 earthquake in Tohoku. The Broad prominently features Los Angeles artists. John McCracken’s “Planks” that lean casually against the wall to contribute to the impression of a detached California cool also endows the tall, slim object with a sense of volition or opposition from traditional paintings for it appears as if it decided to climb down off the wall and immerse itself in the three- dimensional world of the spectator. The glossy and fine finish that offers no indication of the artist’s hand and no sign of the construction process, suggests that the work was born spontaneously, rather than made, in order to critique the falseness of material and capitalism in Los Angeles culture that is predominantly focused on the final product. Single artist galleries on the bottom floor show selected works from a specific artist to demonstrate the museum’s commitment to both the arc of the artist’s career and the viewers’ innate understanding of the art by providing contextual comparisons with which to envision the similar themes and styles that the artist is trying to portray. Similarly, artists that are exhibited together indicate shared concerns and notable emphasis in the collection, such as a strong current of socially and politically themed art, a major focus on American media-saturated culture, as well as particular interest in contemporary German art.

The Arctic Monkeys’ anthem “R U Mine” blared through one speaker as muffled static came through the other. The volume was on maximum to battle the wind coming in from the open window as my beat-up Acura barreled up the 101. I couldn’t help but to turn to my co-pilot and friend, Charlie, and point out how cliché we were as her short, pixie cut flew around her Lennon-esque glasses and my multicolored half buzz flit back and forth with the breeze. She flicked her cigarette out the window as she laughed at the truth of the matter.
As she lets the cigarette crash into the asphalt at 80 miles an hour, we discussed what era we wish we could’ve been born in. Charlie’s a follower of Bowie, a lover of the Velvet Underground and is one of the only people my age I know who can name all four members of Led Zeppelin (yeah, there was more than just Jimmy Page and Robert Plant). So naturally, she chose sometime in the latter half of the 20th century. And from my description of myself, you’d probably assume I’d choose the same. Sorry to disappoint, and to be honest, as a walking cliché, this is the first time I’ve done something unpredictable but I chose the early 2000s. I know, what could I be thinking, right? Bullet ammo adorned belts, terrible highlights and edgy polo shirts? What did the noughties have to offer? Well, thank God I have around 500 more words to explain.
Music has a long and storied history. Even if we limit that to just rock-n-roll, it’s come so far and has even farther left to go. That being said, the 2000s has one especially interesting characteristic: it saved lives. Yes, I know music has always been a powerful tool for inspiring and motivating its listeners and yes, it’s hard to imagine that the Hot Topic-clad boys and girls of this era could save lives, but I stand by it. The early 2000s was filled to the brim with authentic vulnerability. Bands upon bands declared their mental illnesses, their struggles with happiness, and their fear of society in a way that had never been done before. Fall Out Boy popularized being a weirdo while My Chemical Romance took depression from being a fault to being armor. Mayday Parade, Panic! At the Disco, Good Charlotte and early Paramore were soldiers in an army against the norm.
Emo rock, pop punk, pop rock– whatever you want to call these bands of misfits – reignited a war that glam rock started in the ’80s. Alice Cooper and Twisted Sister made their generalized “f-ck you” anthems against the man, and the early ’00s put that through a strainer. Suddenly, it went from battling a mysterious you to battling the demons within, the expectations of society and the loneliness of an evolving world. Fans everywhere went from casual listeners to active warriors. Myspace and now cobwebbed forums are littered with tales of how mentally-ill youth and bullied outcasts found homes in their newly purchased iPods.
Let’s look at an example that even those who weren’t deemed “scene” would recognize; the beloved Jimmy Eat World. The song “The Middle” isn’t just a fun piece of nostalgia to sing along to when drunk; it’s a fight song. With lines like, “You know you’re doing better on your own (on your own), so don’t buy in” and “Hey, don’t write yourself off yet/It’s only in your head you feel left out or looked down on,” the boys of Jimmy Eat World were singing to a nation of disillusioned youth and reminding them it’ll be alright.
These bands were just one-off stadium rock songs about victory or powerhouse ballads of struggles. Their reminders to keep fighting weren’t just one single hidden in an album of love and breakups. They were entire brands reminding their fans that they weren’t alone, that they weren’t defeated and that they had a purpose. Whether it was the darkness of My Chemical Romance starting conversations about what depression really looked like, the balance of Fall Out Boy representing the wounded warrior or the countless other perspectives on pain that the early 2000s offered, it was an era that saved lives.

Undergraduate Student Government President Rini Sampath issued her State of the Student Body address Tuesday, during which she commended USG’s work on addressing racial inequality at USC as well as Provost Michael Quick’s efforts to create a more inclusive campus environment. Her efforts to highlight issues of diversity run headlong to constant criticism of political correctness on campus.
Opposition to Sampath’s advocacy now and over the past year is a microcosm of a larger effort to depict the curb of racist behavior as an institutional acceptance of privileged whining. In response to the establishment of select safe spaces, the discouragement of microaggressions and the urge to behave in a way that exhibits basic human respect, critics have argued that such measures not only infringe on students’ rights of self expression, but also showcase an underlying sentiment that people are entitled wholesale freedom from insult. Opponents to reform call the desire of the student body to be free of racial aggression a mark of “entitlement.”
Criticism only grows more outrageous. On a larger scale, popular GOP candidates including Donald Trump, Jeb Bush and Ted Cruz have jumped on the bandwagon of smearing the eradication of bigotry, claiming that somehow there is not enough time to remain politically correct. Some even go so far as to assert that political correctness — avoiding language implicitly tied to traditions of oppressive dominance — somehow hinders American victory over ISIS.
“I don’t frankly have time for total political correctness,”  Trump stated in a debate earlier this election cycle. “And to be honest with you, this country doesn’t have time either. This country is in big trouble.” Whatever trouble could arise from a lack of insensitive remarks remains to be seen.
It’s sad. It’s unsurprising. Most importantly, and most obviously, it’s wrong.
Critics of safe spaces need desperately to recognize that political correctness is not the doublespeak from their Sparknotes edition of 1984. The very idea of political correctness  developed over time to discourage slurs and aggressions that come from a place of white supremacy, homophobia and institutionalized sexism. Not only do these ideologies threaten the everyday lives of minorities, but they also serve to push back against the advancements of civil society toward social equality. The need for a safe space does not come from the desire of young, coddled college kids to be constantly comfortable. It comes from the pushback of thousands of men and women suffering from institutionalized oppression against the language and behavior that encourages their inequality and the suppression of their civil rights. The discouragement of microaggressions does not exist to allow students to avoid discomfort — it exists to allow them to avoid subjugation at the hands of continued American prejudice. When one is referred to by a slur, the insult is the least of the individual’s concerns — rather, it serves as a peripheral worry in a world set against them, a world accepting of discriminatory behavior. When society allows such an aggression without backlash against the guilty party, it is accepting the inequality — and all the dangers and barriers that come with it.
However, as the GOP candidates have displayed for us in their constant criticism of political correctness, choosing to forgo the rules of civil society is incredibly attractive. From the perspective of the enfranchised and the dominant, a world in which nobody has to be aware of the internalized prejudice they have created  over years of living in a divided and silently oppressive society must appear delectably attractive. After all, if safe spaces are nonexistent and one is in a position to be able to use a racial, homophobic or sexist slur in order to devalue somebody — without having to use any substantive knowledge about that person or their behavior — why not? Why shouldn’t we? Freedom of speech, right?
There is nothing about the college experience that includes learning how it feels to be continuously disrespected. That is not a “learning experience” offered by university life. It is not a part of growing up. This is not a part of the career world. Nobody needs it. And nobody deserves it.

At 5 p.m. on Tuesday, USC students received a TrojansAlert text message warning of police activity in the area, quickly assuring students there was “no threat to USC” and that the “area [was] safe.” The Los Angeles Police Department activity, which the TrojansAlert did not expand on, involved a shooting in which a victim was killed and the shooter fled from police on the Metro. However, students who rely on TrojansAlert to keep them informed would have remained unaware of the gravity of the situation — especially those riding on the Metro at the time, not to mention the countless students and faculty members who walk past this intersection on their way to and from campus.
Tuesday’s shooting is just the most recent example of TrojansAlert’s lack of transparency and failure to serve its purpose to keep students aware of safety hazards and incidents in the community. The service has gone too far to sugarcoat activities in the local community, neglecting its duty to inform students in the effort to prevent unnecessary alarm.
When wide-eyed freshmen are first urged to sign up for TrojansAlert at orientation, the download comes with an expectation of awareness and security. Registering with the service on your cell phone signifies taking safety into your own hands — literally. But in order to be safe, students need to be made aware — and TrojansAlert is not keeping us aware.
A quick look at the text messages sent by TrojansAlert this past week makes it appear that the incident at Jesse Brewer Park on Tuesday was of little importance. According to the messages, it didn’t involve USC, and the area was safe, but students were urged to keep away from the area. This is not the type of language that should be used to convey a fatal shooting happening in our own backyard.
Moreover, the fact that the victim and shooter were not affiliated with USC — which the TrojansAlert text messages stated twice — does not make the actions surrounding their encounter less relevant to the student population. For a university that claims to be strongly rooted in the local community, this is a rather quick dismissal of a significant occurrence just a stone’s throw away from the gates of campus. USC student or not, we are all residents of Los Angeles, and some of us even live in close proximity to the intersection of Vermont and Exposition Boulevard where the shooting took place.
In fact, the Department of Public Safety told the Daily Trojan shortly after the incident that the TrojansAlert was sent not to warn students about the gravitas of a situation involving a shooter right outside the southwest corner of campus. Rather, the message was sent to notify that the LAPD investigation led to increased traffic at the intersection. According to DPS, there was no direct threat to USC.
TrojansAlert should not be sent with the intent of notifying students of an everyday inconvenience like increased traffic. They should be sent with the intent to make potentially dangerous situations of and around campus known so students can react accordingly. It seems counterintuitive that increased traffic would be more pressing than the details of a fatal shooting at an intersection, not only across from campus but also on many students’ routes to and from campus.
It seems TrojansAlert prescribes an “out of sight, out of mind” mentality. As long as a USC student isn’t involved and it isn’t on campus, the details of the incident are somewhat superfluous. This just is not the case. The community around USC is not just an urban landscape illuminating the brick-clad fortress of USC — it’s our home. If our home is threatened in any way, we should be notified.

San Diego, the second-largest city in California, is the ideal place for any Trojan to take a two or three day trip. With its close proximity to Los Angeles, widely known scenery and countless events, San Diego remains a popular location for students to frequent, even if only for the weekend.
La Jolla in the Mornin’: After grabbing brunch at the Pannikin or Cody’s, bike over to La Jolla’s pristine beaches, such as Windansea and La Jolla Cove. If you start to feel more adventurous, hike to Torrey Pines Gliderport where you can learn to hang glide and paraglide over a phenomenal landscape.

Time flies • From sitting at orientation with my freshman-year roommate (left) to starting off my final year with my senior-year roommate (right), I’ve learned a lot over the past three and a half years, and I’m planning to make the most of the time I have left. Emily Goldberg | Daily Trojan

Seven semesters down, one to go. Time to commence internal freak out.
In what seems like a blink of an eye I’m in the home stretch of my college career. The dreaded G-word is less than four months away, and I’m in denial that I’ve already received an email about ordering my cap and gown. Just over a week ago I buckled my seatbelt on a plane from New York to L.A. to start my last semester of college, and I couldn’t help but feel that what I was really doing was strapping myself into the emotional roller coaster that will be this semester. 
There’s certain things about college that I’m definitely ready to part with — from research papers to fraternity house floors coated in so many layers of beer that your shoes stick to the floor. It’s true that I’m also excited about what’s to come: hopefully a job that I love, maybe moving to a new city, meeting new people. But like most college seniors, part of me is a little bit terrified of what the real world holds. What will life look like when I don’t live in within walking distance of all my friends, when I’ll be forced to trade in the 9-0 for the 9 to 5, and when I actually become an adult?
However, I know I can’t stop the clock from ticking forward, and it won’t do me any good to look back (but there will be plenty of nostalgic moments anyway, I am sure). I may not be able to ward away the inevitable “Pomp and Circumstance,” but what I know I can do is make the most of my last months as an undergraduate student. In the next four months here’s what I hope to accomplish: 
Late night drive to In-N-Out? Yes. Weekend trip to Vegas? Yes. Day trip to hike in Malibu? Yes. Going out on a random Monday night? Yes. I’m a planner by nature, but this semester I want to make an effort to be a little bit more spontaneous and try new things. So count me in for just about everything. Whether it’s going to a new place, or going with new people, there’s just no reason to say no when I know the real world means waking up before 10 a.m. on Fridays, and free time is much more limited. 
Since I’m not sure if I’ll be staying in L.A. after graduation. I want to make the most of the next four (gasp) months that I definitely have left in this city. California has so much to offer from the great outdoors at Big Sur and Yosemite to some of the best restaurants in the country.  Although it might put a strain on my wallet, I’m determined to cross off some of the destinations, restaurants and neighborhoods that have been sitting on my bucket list for way too long. 
I’m really excited about all of my classes this semester, but I also want to take advantage of everything else USC has to offer, from workshops at Annenberg to Visions and Voices events, I might not have some of these FREE (… well for the cost of tuition) resources at my disposal again in the future. My inner-nerd is definitely going to be out in full force this semester. 
It’s a little hard not to stress when I feel like I’m at such a defining time in my life, and everyone is making post-grad plans. Plus, constantly being asked what my post-grad plans are is a little daunting considering that at the moment I have more of a rough outline than a full-fledged plan. But I have a feeling that the world outside of college is going to be even more stressful, and in five years I’ll look back on this moment and wish I took one extra chill pill. So as I scroll through job postings and submit applications left and right, I’m going to try to not be so high strung about it. Even if I need a reminder every now and then, I know that (even if it doesn’t follow my ideal timeline) everything happens for a reason, and my post-grad life will eventually fall into place.

For those of you who are getting tired of eating kale and drinking kombucha for your New Year’s resolutions, let me do the honors of welcoming you back to the good life. On my most recent donut adventure, I followed the road down Vermont Avenue to an up-and-coming donut shop called Fantastic Donuts. 
Though at first glance, Fantastic Donuts doesn’t seem like a typical foodie destination, I believe the shop shows great potential. In the near future, I predict that more and more photos of their donuts will be populating Instagram.
In fact, it was through Instagram that I first heard of this place. I know, I know. Whenever I go to any donut place, I always say, “These are the cutest donuts ever!”— but trust me, these really are the cutest donuts ever! 
Paulina Ordaz | Daily Trojan
The majority of the shop consists of other traditional donuts, such as the chocolate old-fashioned donut shown below, but Fantastic Donuts is mainly known for their array of adorable animal donuts and donut holes.
The day I went, there were only two animal donut holes left, but I also noticed a sign saying that those mini donuts were only available through preorder. I was disappointed to say the least, because I was hoping to do a donut photoshoot with both the regular-sized and the mini donuts. 
Paulina Ordaz | Daily Trojan
For some reason though, the store owner decided to just give me the two that were left without even charging! To this day, I don’t understand how I got so #blessed, but I’ve learned to not question these moments. However, with that being said, if you do want to try the donut holes, be sure to email fantasticdonutLA@gmail.com beforehand to make sure they will be available.
Usually when I go to donut places that make a serious effort to make their donuts look aesthetically nice, I don’t expect them to taste as great as they look. Surprise, surprise! Fantastic Donuts’ confections were fantastic. The frosting on the mini donut holes didn’t just taste like condensed sugar; the chick donut was banana-flavored, and the cat one tasted like blueberries! My favorite, however, was the cow donut — and not just because it was the biggest. I loved the jelly filling, and overall, it had just the right jelly-to-dough ratio.
Paulina Ordaz | Daily Trojan
I will definitely be visiting Fantastic Donuts again, especially since it is so close to campus and it’s open 24 hours. I hope more USC students will find this place as fantastic as I did. So here’s to a new year and new donut places to try in the next few months. It’s good to be back.
Fantastic Donuts is open 24 hours a day, seven days a week at Gold Plaza, 1101 S. Vermont Ave. #113, Los Angeles, CA 90006.

Efforts to reform the campus climate were discussed at the  first ever campus climate open forum held in Doheny Memorial library Wednesday night. This forum is the first of five this semester, held to produce a set of benchmarks or desired outcomes to move toward a better climate on campus.
The panel, titled “Where We Have Been, Where We Are Going”, was sponsored by the USC Office of the Provost and the USC Dornsife Office for Diversity and Strategic Initiatives.
The two-hour panel was moderated by Tara McPherson, a professor in the School of Cinematic Arts, and included senior administrators such as Michael Quick, provost and senior vice president for student affairs, and George Sanchez, the vice president of the Dornsife Office for Diversity and Strategic Affairs.
The student panelists included Mykaila Williams, the executive director of the Black Student Assembly and Debbie Rumbo, an alumna who majored in political science and graduated in 2013.
After the impromptu meeting on Nov. 12 with Vice President of Student Affairs Ainsley Carry and Quick, a “Provost Task Force” was launched. The proposed task force consists ten individuals; two undergraduate students, two graduate students, two faculty members, two staff members, Carry and Varun Soni, dean of Religious Life.
The panel began with McPherson bringing up the difficulty about having conversation on diversity on campus, and the need to challenge issues with fervor and transparency.
“When I hear the repeated statement ‘the people aren’t ready,’ it’s like telling a person ‘don’t jump in that water until you learn to swim’,” McPherson said. “You’ll never learn how to swim if you don’t get in the water. So we’re going to jump in.”
Provost Michael Quick echoed these sentiments, as well as thanking the students and faculty involved with the development of the resolution.
“These are difficult issues, these are issues that are hard to really talk about in deep ways,” Quick said. “I appreciate the time that people have spent in having these conversations.”
Quick then spoke on a necessary commitment to the campus issues, and the need for college campuses to live up to their progressive reputations.
“Universities are going to figure out a way forward on issues that we are talking about right now. We are going to be the standard-bearers, not only for other universities but for how this country is going to deal with issues around diversity and access to opportunity,” Quick said.
Quick addressed the positive aspects of implementing diversity initiatives.
“When we talk about campus climate, that’s an important endpoint in and of itself but I think it also is the launching pad for us to accomplish much more,” Quick said. “If we don’t have the appropriate climate so that our students and our faculty feel like they can do the best work they can do, then what are the chances we’ll be able to recruit even more students, even more faculty?”
Williams spoke next on the panel. Williams gave poignant vignettes of marginalized students at USC; including a student being escorted to class by DPS officers out of fears for other students, and transmisogynist graffiti scrawled on dorm-room doors.
“[The student] who had to be escorted to classes by DPS at a certain point in his career was not for his safety but the safety of other students because they were afraid of him” said Williams.
Williams also suggested a zero-tolerance attitude to discrimination on campus, when dealing with racial-, gender- or sexual- based prejudice.
“Just as the death of a student is addressed to the entire USC community, instances of bigotry, racial profiling and sexual assault and instance of discrimination have to handled with that same sense of urgency,” Williams said.
George Sanchez, vice dean of diversity and strategic initiatives, asked audience members to refer to a timeline of the history of USC.
“What happened in 2011 was a step back,” Sanchez said of when Provost Elizabeth Garrett’s administration put in place cuts to diversity programs.
Rumbo provided the perspective of a representative of both a USC graduate and a woman of color. Rumbo spoke of her clean record as a college student and her subsequent arrest on campus.
“I was still a black woman in Los Angeles. I was still a Latina in Los Angeles,” Rumbo said.
Rumbo drew parallels to other elite universities and the action over these issues. Rumbo presented a copy of Yale Alumni Magazine to the audience and spoke of the lack of discussion occurring at other institutions.
“USC is at the forefront of this movement,” Rumbo said.

Robert Dilligan, an associate professor emeritus of English, died last Monday after a long battle with Parkinson’s disease. He was 75.
Dilligan will be remembered for his important work in unifying technology with the humanities. He received his P.h.D from the University of Wisconsin in 1970 and joined USC as an English professor that same year. His fields of expertise were in Victorian poetry and the use of computers for literary research. At the time of his retirement in 2005, he had taught at USC for 36 years.
In addition to his work as a professor, Dilligan served as a director of data processing in the University’s Freshman Writing Program from 1979 to 1985. He also acted as the chair of the University Computing Committee, associate chair of the English department and a member of the editorial board for the journal Computer and the Humanities. He authored 19 books, on topics ranging from poetry to computing.
His colleague Leo Braudy, a professor of English and American literature, spoke about his efforts to integrate computing with the humanities.
“He was a pioneer in connecting literature with computers, and a pioneer in the digital humanities,” Braudy said. “He was a real forerunner.”
Dilligan was awarded a Fulbright Grant in 1977 to research at the National University Computing Center University of Pisa. His daughter Elizabeth Lubin spoke about the memorable times she spent with her family because of their move to Italy.
“That was a very special time for my parents,” Lubin said. “They took us kids to so many museums, and were really immersed in the Italian lifestyle. It was a really special time for our family, and that was possible because of his academic career.”
Outside of the classroom, Dilligan was a gourmet chef, a world traveler and a marathon runner. He was well-known among the English department for dinner parties and poker nights.
“He loved to cook, and so did I. He gave a lot of beautiful dinner parties,” William Brown, associate professor emeritus of English, said. “They had a fairly large dining room, and of course people would spill out into the backyard.”
Dilligan is survived by his three children, Timothy Dilligan, Kathleen Dilligan and Elizabeth Lubin ’90; as well as his three granddaughters, Sarah Lubin, Grace Lubin and Ellie Dilligan.
A memorial has been planned for Feb. 6 at Town & Gown.

Viterbi’s Venture Incubation Program, created to help USC students develop their ideas from startups into innovative companies, has recently announced this year’s 11 teams. These entrepreneurs will be given tools to build prototypes, receive funding and effectively grow their businesses.
Founded last year, VIP is a student-run incubator for tech startups that is open to all current USC students. It provides its teams with technical support, mentors and a co-working space, in addition to industry guest speakers. Participants need to be committed to their startups, which at the outset of the program varies from early-stage business plans to fully-launched companies.
VIP is located in the USC Hacker House on Adams Boulevard, where groups have access to workspace five days a week as well as a suite of technologies at their fingertips, such as 3D printing, virtual reality and motion sensors. Teams are paired with mentors that give feedback and advice on anything from product development to investor presentations.
VIP seeks to foster a collaborative environment between teams, creating a community of like-minded innovators. Participants have frequent opportunities to provide feedback and suggestions to other teams, with an emphasis on collective success rather than competition.
“We think of our [VIP’s] environment as more of a community than other incubators,” said Natalie Riso, vice president of marketing for VIP. “We have monthly dinners where teams talk about their current struggles and successes together and how they overcame different obstacles.”
VIP also hosts speakers often to connect groups with industry leaders, who share their professional experiences with students. Past speakers have included tech mogul Evan Spiegel, founder of Snapchat, and Alexis Ohanian, co-founder of Reddit.
Last year, VIP’s inaugural cohort boasted the largest percentage of its teams that received funding of all USC incubator programs. After VIP, startups go on to continue cultivating their products and services, receive financial support from venture capitalists or operate as an independent business. EnvoyNow, a popular app where students can order food for delivery from local restaurants, was selected for VIP last year.
HostelPass, a participant in VIP, is a startup that provides travelers an easy method for booking hostels while on the go and won last year’s “1000 Pitches” competition.
“Everyone in the VIP program has incredible ideas,” said Sarah Weingust, a senior majoring in psychology and a partner with HostelPass, in an email to the Daily Trojan. “I am excited to see how far we come collectively and individually through this process.”
Trakfire was also chosen to participate in VIP this year. Trakfire provides a platform where undiscovered artists have the opportunity to post their music and receive feedback from users via an upvote polling system. Music industry giant Jimmy Iovine serves as a mentor for the Trakfire team, and Troy Carter from the popular television show Shark Tank featured Trakfire as one of the top startups on his tech accelerator, SMASHD.
VIP is also working to create its first ever Startup Career Fair in February. Open to the public, attendees will be able to visit teams’ booths to learn about their companies and available job opportunities.
“The Venture Incubation Program is the newest and most comprehensive technology incubator in the USC ecosystem,” Riso said. “We strive to take and create companies that are ready for success regardless of their education level or specific industry.”
The program is currently accepting applications on a rolling basis, and interested students can visit VIP’s website or Facebook page for more information on applying.

The Undergraduate Student Government External Affairs team hosted their bi-annual Council of Presidents at the Ronald Tutor Campus Center Ballroom Wednesday. This networking event brought more than a hundred USC organizations together to give them a chance to open communications with USG and each other.
Lexi Orozco, director of external affairs, proceeded to give an introductory speech.
“On behalf of myself, my associate Ian Scott, and president Rini Sampath, we want to thank you for taking your time to come out here and be recognized for your contributions to USC,” Orozco said. “We’re hoping that this event, at the beginning of the year, can form connections and collaborations that will bring different clubs together.”
Daphne Blakey, president of the Recreational Club Council, said that the event was a great way to streamline the networking process between recognized student organizations.
“It’s cool to meet other leaders to find out what’s going on on campus so we can probably working together,” Blakey said.
Ian Scott, assistant director of external affairs, noted that the attendance of this event was far better than one that USG initially put on in the fall.
“Last year, we did the [Council of the Presidents] in fall at the end of the semester, [and] now we are hosting the event in the beginning of the year,” Scott said. “We want to have a comfortable environment for all USC club organizations. When we hosted the event in fall, not a lot of club representatives showed up. Now we changed the time to spring so organizations can have a better sense of what USG is, where we have open arms to help whenever they need it.”
USG President Rini Sampath wants the connection between club organizations and USG to be strong not only for the benefit for of the club now, but in the future.
“Take a moment to look around and the students in the room. My hope for all of you to know the individuals around you,” Sampath said. ”It’s more fun to live in the moment. You may never know the people you get to meet and the impact they will have on your lives.”
The event also helped recognized student organizations get into contact with each other while enjoying Pasta Roma. Abha Nath, president of Engineers Without Borders, who hopes to collaborate with the Trojan Youth Soccer League following the event.
“We hope to work with the Trojan Youth Soccer League in terms of management and finance,” said Nath.
Claire Chatinover, president of Chalk the Block, hopes to collaborate with Elise Green, co-captain of the women’s lacrosse team, to bring awareness of her club and inspire troubled children around USC.
“We hope to work and bring our clubs together. We want to help each other out,” Chatinover said.
Green was also excited to collaborate with other groups.
“Although we are a branch of the Recreational Club Council, we are excited to work independently with other groups,” Green said.
Overall, Scott was pleased with the outcome.
“When I first started at USG, The room used to be empty with chairs, now we’re bringing in more tables and chairs to accommodate more students. I think social media and the marketing team did a great job,” Scott said.
Correction: A previous version of this article identified Lexi Orozco as co-assistant director of external affairs and Ian Scott as co-associate director. Orozco is the director of external affairs and Scott the assistant director. The Daily Trojan regrets the errors.

The football team has faced numerous staff changes over the past season. Director of Orthopedic Athletic Medicine for USC Athletics Seth Gamradt, however, has remained on the sidelines through it all.
“I’m on the sidelines for all the football games, home and away,” Gamradt said. “I try to go to as many of the other sports as I can, but you can’t be in every place at once.”
As director, Gamradt tends to athletes from all 21 of the University’s Division I intercollegiate college sports. When he’s not healing athletes, he’s teaching academic fellows and residents about sports medicine surgery as an associate professor of clinical orthopedic surgery.
He played many sports while growing up and has always been a big sports fan, his favorite being football. After he graduated from Pepperdine University, Gamradt departed for Weill Cornell Medical College in New York City. There, he found his passion in sports medicine.
“When I was at medical school, some of my mentors and favorite doctors were sports medicine physicians who cared for the teams in New York,” Gamradt said. “I also wanted to do sports medicine and wanted to care for both recreational and collegiate athletes in my career.”
One of his favorite doctors was Russell Warren, the head physician of over 30 years for the New York Giants.
“He’s someone that I modeled my career after,” Gamradt said. “He’s one of the absolute legends in the field and it’s nice to have role models like that.”
After completing his one-year residency at UCLA Medical Center, Gamradt followed in Warren’s footsteps by working on the sidelines of the Giants as an assistant team physician. After working with the Giants, he returned to UCLA to work as a faculty member for seven years as a team physician for football, women’s soccer and baseball.
In 2013 he was asked to come to USC and take his current position.
“That was an opportunity I couldn’t pass up,” he said. “So instead of being a Bruin, I’m now a Trojan.”
His typical day at Keck School of Medicine of USC consists of a specific process. Every Tuesday and Thursday, Gamradt performs between five and six surgeries per day starting at 7:30 a.m. Other days, Gamradt teaches at an academic conference about sports medicine surgery and sees between 30 and 40 patients.
“You’re constantly doing surgeries that have a high success rate,” Gamradt said. “Patients come in with either pain or disfunction in their shoulder, knees or elbows, and you’re able to make their quality of life better from a pain and function standpoint.”
He considers every healed patient a “small victory” and conducts clinical research to improve future surgeries.
“We’re focused on outcome data,” Gamradt said. “We look at the results of all the surgeries that we do, and we determine how to improve those outcomes of shoulder and knee procedures in the future.”
Though he believes it’s impossible to prevent all injuries from taking place due to the nature of sports, particularly contact sports, ways to reduce injury exist.
“You’ll never take the risk to zero, but there are certain exercises that all athletes can do to try and prevent those types of injuries from happening,” Gamradt said.
Though his work schedule is demanding, he finds the profession rewarding.
“Every day is a highlight,” Gamradt said.
Dr. Gamradt sees patients at the USC Health Sciences Campus and Keck USC Beverly Hills. He is also available to see students, faculty and staff at the Engemann Student Health Center on Fridays.

For junior Kevin Kassel, winning the Schwarzenegger Institute’s Spotlight Award was cause for much excitement,  but in the words of his friend and former roommate, junior business administration major Andrew Lux, “[Kassel] didn’t need the award to validate what he has done.” Kassel is the founder of Club H2O, an organization that provides water filters to developing nations.
Kassel, a business administration and environmental studies double major, was first introduced to the global water crisis in high school when he toured apparel company Hurley’s headquarters and learned about their efforts to provide developing nations with filters. Inspired by Hurley’s efforts, Kassel started a club at his high school dedicated to sending filters to countries such as India, Pakistan and Nepal.
“My surf team in high school was sponsored by the surf company Hurley, and Hurley would send their pro surfers all over the world to exotic surf bases, sometimes with water filters to donate. I was going on a trip one summer to the Galapagos and [Hurley] asked if I would bring one of their filters with me,” Kassel said. “It was a pretty unbelievable experience because I really didn’t understand just how much of a difference one water filter could make, but after giving one to a school I was working at in the Galapagos, I started sending them out with friends and family members and eventually started a club at my high school dedicated to that.”
Passionate about this cause, Kassel founded Club H2O when he arrived at USC. Now, his club raises funds to purchase filters which they give to people traveling to developing nations. This method of sending filters with travelers reduced Club H2O’s shipping costs and ensured that the filters would reach their target destinations without possible government interference.
Lux notes how central Kassel’s work with Club H20 has been to his life and college career.
“[Kassel] constantly tried to find ways to raise money for his club, whether it was throwing a fundraising party or reaching out to family, friends and students asking for any donations,” Lux said. “When the earthquake hit Nepal last spring, Kevin worked endlessly to send them as many water filters as he could buy with his club. He ended up with almost $5,000 of fundraising in order to support the people of Nepal.”
Bonnie Reiss, the global director of the Schwarzenegger Institute, explains that when picking a winner for the Spotlight award, she and her team were looking for a student whose project had great depth and scope of impact.
“[Kassel] was looking at access to safe drinking water and the truth is that over one billion people in the developing world do not have access to safe drinking water. For a USC student to care about this life-or-death issue, was very inspirational,” Reiss said. “[Kassel] understood that one water filter could provide safe drinking water for up to 100 people and he was very clever about delivering the filters with people already traveling to developing countries.”
Reiss also notes the importance of student involvement, encouraging students to take inspiration from Kassel and “be the change.”
“Arnold [Schwarzenegger] always said that as important as our political leaders are in passing laws, some of the greatest things don’t happen in government, they happen with individual people and what they are able to do to make a difference,” Reiss said.
With the $1,000 prize Kassel received from the Schwarzenegger Institute, he plans to purchase more water filters to be sent to developing countries.
