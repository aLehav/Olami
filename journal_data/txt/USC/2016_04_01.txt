Bear with me, but I saw a tweet the other day that really stuck with me (I warned you to bear with me) — “Everyone from the center should live in the periphery for a while. It changes your thinking.”
And while Turkey really isn’t the periphery, to a majority of the Western world, particularly in the United States, it might as well be. The country has suffered greatly over the last six months and more, and if I did a reflective blog post after every (major) terror attack that I was here for, this would be my third one. It’s not that I think the Eiffel Tower should light up with the colors of the Turkish flag after every attack; to a degree, I understand that Western countries tend to sympathize more with those whose cultures and common history are shared, whether mythological or in reality.
Rather, what I think is more important to question are the things that can be changed to prevent or at least minimize the kind of violence that happens all too often in the so-called “periphery.” As an international relations student, I find it hard not to view this through the lens of global politics and the never-ending quest for hegemony, or at least regional power among countries. But there is so much more that determines to what extent we sympathize with other countries — culture, religion, language, etc., and a lack of knowledge about each of these things.
I wouldn’t even begin to know how to address current issues in Turkey, and more widely, in Europe and the Middle East, but if I’ve learned anything from my two-plus months here so far, it’s that we as Americans ought to be far more aware of the impact our policies can have, and we also need to be far more aware of other cultures. Not in a superficial way either — but in a way that allows for more than just a dismissal along the lines of “that’s just how it is in that part of the world.” We need to think critically about why it is we feel that way, because it certainly isn’t historically accurate — only within the last century, it was Europe that was, as one of my (European) professors once put it, the “basket case of the world,” a continent wracked with genocides and two world wars.
What I don’t think we need are more Facebook profile picture filters, although they are symbolic and can be of slight comfort if nothing else. There has already been a million think-pieces about the hypocrisy of sympathizing with certain countries and not others, but if there is a silver lining at all to any of the horrors currently taking place around the world, I hope at least that the backlash against selective profile picture changes and the like will spark a greater discussion about why our sympathies are so skewed when it comes to places like Lahore and Paris.
It’s also hard not to feel a bit self-centered thinking about terror attacks when I leave the country in less than two months, and my Turkish friends do not have that option. People I have met from other countries that have recently suffered similar violence, such as Egypt, will also return to places that the American government does not recognize as “safe.” And while, unfortunately, I may be the last USC student here for a while, I hope I can return soon and see all that I originally wanted to see. Istanbul is nothing short of an amazing city — I hope my future posts can spend more time on what makes this place so special. And then maybe, it will cease to be the “periphery,” for someone else, too.

If you’re still reading this article, kudos.
A lot of 18- to 22-year-old college students already have most of their brain space consumed with issues more apropos to their age group — that WRIT 340 paper due tomorrow that you haven’t started, which frats are throwing parties this coming weekend or how you’re possibly going to afford those tickets to Coachella 2017.
This is not to claim that only petty, superficial issues cross our adolescent minds, but there is something to say for worrying about the things that most directly influence your life at the time. College, for many young adults, is a time (perhaps the last time) where we are the most carefree from those big, weighty “adult” issues like tax returns, income inequality and health care reform.
If you had tried to talk to me a year ago about health care I would have rolled my eyes and quickly changed the subject to Instagram, Oscar-worthy movies or the latest fad in fashion before getting caught in the monotony of political policies.
But after my own serious health scare, a riveting documentary by Michael Moore and, believe it or not, a WRIT 150 paper assignment, I found myself at possibly one of the last real bookstores left, frantically searching for books on the American health care system.
As I sat in an over-air conditioned Starbucks for the three hours reading T.R. Reid’s The Healing of America: A Global Quest For Better, Cheaper, and Fairer Health Care, what I found shocked and riveted me and I couldn’t stop turning the pages.
I’ll lay it out for you as I understand it.
You may or may not remember President Harry Truman (perhaps from AP US History if you didn’t block out that time of your life). He was the first person to propose national health insurance, providing health coverage for all Americans. This idea didn’t really come to the forefront until 1965 when President Lyndon Johnson established the Medicare program, which provides health care for many low-income Americans who would otherwise not have any health care. This was definitely a milestone in American history, but the system still wasn’t great and there was no universal coverage.
It wasn’t until President Barack Obama came around just a few years ago that we really saw another attempt to change the system. Public Law 111-148: The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, or as many refer to it, “Obamacare” was meant to expand coverage, increase the pay of primary care doctors and ultimately slow the growth of medical costs.
Perhaps it is because I have learned to be skeptical and cynical of many things in my teenage years, but the problems that still plague our health care system seem extraordinary. While the law has no doubt done a lot of good for a lot of people, there is still a plethora of issues with our health care system that must be addressed immediately.
As of 2010, 50 million Americans were uninsured. While many are now covered under “Obamacare,” millions of Americans belonging to low-income groups (especially racial minorities) remain uninsured today. This means that if they have an aching back or stomach, many forgo visiting a doctor simply to avoid the wildly high medical bills.
Plus, even while many more people are insured, the cost of insurance is skyrocketing.
The American health care system is by far the most costly system in the world and the costs are in exchange for subpar quality in many areas of the country, leaving millions of Americans without health insurance.
Globally, America is ranked No. 37, just above Slovenia, in health care systems. There are so many more issues on this subject that candidates are addressing it right now as the 2016 election approaches — the fact that insurance companies are “profit making,” that people get denied coverage for necessary surgeries every day, that the health care industry is killing people by not paying for procedures and medications.
This issue is a very complicated one and I still don’t even know a quarter of the necessary information, but I think it’s an important topic for everyone to understand a bit about. I think a lot of teenagers don’t bother with complicated issues because it doesn’t directly affect them, takes far too much effort to fully comprehend or they feel like even if they did understand there’s nothing they can really do about it anyways or maybe all of the above. I know I’ve felt all of the above reasons many a time.
An issue like health care can seem especially unimportant to many college kids because so many teenagers think they are invincible. But unless you’ve gone through a health crisis, and even then, most students are covered under their parents’ health care plan, it never crosses their minds that they might get sick and need care one day.
Even when we hear stories of kids getting in car accidents or getting sick or even going to the hospital for a night, we don’t believe that it could happen to us. We often live our lives recklessly, moment by moment, carefree. I think in so many ways this is a beautiful thing about youth that you can’t get back, but health is something that affects everyone every day whether you realize it or not.
While health care reform may seem like a snooze fest that doesn’t directly affect you right now (and hopefully it never really has to), it most definitely affects someone you know and probably someone you care about. There are millions of people out there, including people you know personally or have met, that have to live in fear of getting sick because they have no guarantee that they will receive quality medical care. Others are still trying to pay bills that are keeping them alive and well.
So crack open a few books on health care reform, spend some time on Google and check out the candidates’ platforms on health care. Health care is too important an issue to push aside due to its complexity and, maybe as the bright youth of America, we could be the ones to help push it toward a real and lasting reformation.

Vice Provost for Academic and Faculty Programs Elizabeth A. Graddy announced the appointment of Professor Andrea Hodge as the vice provost for undergraduate programs in an email to students Friday morning. Hodge will fill the seat of Professor Gene Bickers, who Graddy said decided to step down in order to pursue research and teaching.
Hodge has been a faculty member at USC since 2007 and has since then held the Arthur B. Freeman Professorship in the Viterbi School of Engineering and a joint appointment in the Mork Family Department of Chemical Engineering and Materials Science and the Department of Aerospace and Mechanical Engineering. Hodge also oversees the Hodge Materials Nanotechnology Research Group.
Hodge holds a bachelor’s degree from the University of Nevada, Las Vegas and a doctoral degree from Northwestern University. Prior to joining the faculty at USC, Hodge worked at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory.
In her email, Graddy thanked Bickers for his service in the undergraduate programs office. She noted his efforts in implementing a consistent advising program for all undergraduate students. Graddy said that during his tenure, the six-year graduation rate at USC increased by 10 percent.
“His commitment and leadership have been essential to the continued success of our undergraduate programs, and his tireless efforts have produced far-reaching benefits across the university,” Graddy said in the email.

Sports. The always-ridiculed section of the newspaper. Why do we even write about sports? It’s a bunch of men and women competing and aiming for glory with nothing but a singlet, a helmet or a racket to assist them.
Of course, there are flaws in the sports industry. We consistently see issues of drug doping, infidelity and, of course, absurd amounts of money at the professional level.
We see the contradiction between academic excellence and monetary gain at the collegiate level to go along with recruiting scandals and the fact that collegiate athletes are not making any money from their hours of hard work to benefit their university.
Yet, sports continues to be my passion. I’m not exactly sure why yet — it could have something to do with the bond that my father and I fostered over our mutual love for sports or the great memories that I have from my own days as an athlete growing up — but sports it is. On that I’ve decided.
I think athletes are some of the most impressive people walking around USC’s campus. It isn’t everyday that someone manages to maintain a GPA and compete for a national championship in their given sport.
Athletes are the unsung heroes of the campus who dedicate so much to the team, the school and the community. I like this aspect of sports. I like the people who are behind the athletes much more than the results of the game.
That isn’t to say that I don’t love a good rivalry game. I cheer as loud as anyone in the Coliseum, but my trade is storytelling. I find true passion when I am writing about athletes away from their game.
There is a delicate balance in this field of telling these “fluffy” stories and giving the hard facts about what happened during a game. There is also a terrible misconception that sports journalists are out to dig up dirt about athletes and expose all of the ways they aren’t good role models for kids. This certainly isn’t the case for me.
An athlete is just a person who is far more talented and athletic than I am. That is how I approach them and that’s what I like to make people see — athletes are people too. I thrive on telling the stories that people supposedly don’t want to read, the stories about community service, dedication to family and the road to recovery from injury.
Perhaps I’m a dying or misunderstood breed, but I maintain my faith that sports fans are interested in who athletes are as people. Those stories take more work, are harder to come by and return less in hits or reads or whatever we measure success by in journalism. At the end of the day, though, those are the sports stories worth telling.
It’s an always-difficult decision to pursue, but in reality, the choice really isn’t hard. It’s simply about showing respect and understanding of the athlete as human.

Time is ticking for the soon-to-be graduates out there with only four weeks left of school. Whether you’re from Los Angeles or not, there is no doubt that this city serves up some of the best eats in the world. There’s something for everyone, from the pizza snob to the coffee connoisseur to the brunch fanatic. Here are a list of my top ten places that you just have to visit before you graduate and leave this paradise.
This L.A. staple has multiple locations in Santa Monica, West Hollywood, Beverly Hills and in L.A.’s Arts District. With the nearest being just a ten minute drive from USC, you have no excuse not to go!

Calling all sushi lovers! Famous for their spicy tuna with crispy rice, this sushi hot spot will quickly become one of your favorites. The best part? USC students receive a 15 percent discount. (Don’t forget your student I.D. though!)

One of the most picturesque restaurants that L.A. has to offer, this one is well worth the drive up the Pacific Coast Highway.

If this is your final year at USC and you haven’t been to Lemonade, you must be living under a rock. Located in the center of our gorgeous campus, this is one of the best on-campus eats! You can even use dining dollars!

I’m not kidding when I say that this fish melts in your mouth. Definitely don’t want to leave Los Angeles without trying this sushi staple. Trust me, when you leave L.A., you will be craving it from miles away.

This restaurant offers the best view in Los Angeles. Located on the 15th floor, enjoy your food with panoramic views of one of the best cities in the world.

Feeling healthy? Head to Cafe Gratitude, one of Los Angeles’ most sustainable restaurants that offers a host of gourmet options, from raw Hawaiian pizza to eggplant parmesan panini to a homemade sushi bowl.
Miranda Mazariegos | Daily Trojan
Yes, you read that right. This is one of L.A.’s hidden gems, located just a short drive from campus in the heart of Grand Central Market. Beware: The line on weekends could be up to two hours, so try and make a trip during the week. I promise that their egg sandwiches won’t disappoint.

If you’re sick of Starbucks, it’s time to venture out to either the West Hollywood, Silver Lake or Brentwood locations for the best iced latte you will ever have in your life. It’s worth skipping class for this coffee place.
Jackie Mayuga | Daily Trojan
Nothing better than an ice cream cone on sunny L.A. afternoon as we head into the final stretch of the semester.

Regardless of whether if you’ve only got three years or one month left of school, these ten Los Angeles eats definitely deserve a trip!
