The Board of Trustees has elected Lionsgate Executive Vice President and General Counsel Corii Berg as its newest member, according to USC News. Berg previously held the position of USC Alumni Association Board of Governors president.
“Corii Berg is a passionate and inclusive leader whose strategic communication and management skills make him a valuable addition to our board,” President Carol Folt said. “We are excited to welcome him to this important new role.”
During his tenure, Berg, who was a first-generation college student at USC, hopes to emphasize diversity and accessibility at the University, he told USC News. 
“It’s really important to be open and inclusive and ensure we make all opportunities available to our very qualified students to contribute their experiences and knowledge to all our programs,” Berg told USC News.
In addition to promoting inclusion on campus, Berg said he wants to prioritize USC community members’ health and safety amid the pandemic. On Tuesday, the University announced a plan to reopen campus in the fall with the majority of classes available both in person and online.
Berg has spent more than the last two decades in stints with Lionsgate and Sony Pictures, heading business affairs at each corporation. He assumed a prominent legal role with Lionsgate and, before working at Sony, gained experience in legal work with law firm Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom.
Berg is a 1989 graduate with degrees in journalism from the Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism and political science from the Dornsife College of Letters, Arts and Sciences. 
“When I came to USC, my world was very small,” said Berg, who went on to earn a law degree at Loyola Law School in 1992. “I took my first international trip as part of a study abroad program. USC literally opened my eyes to the world.”
Berg has served on the USC Annenberg Alumni Advisory Board and currently works on the school’s Board of Councilors.
“Everyone feels a little disconnected from everything right now,” he said. “One of our strongest attributes at USC is the constant connectivity with our alumni. It’s incumbent on all of us to continue to engage those alumni, including young alumni, to make sure we can harness everything that is great about the Trojan Family.”
Berg’s wife Cari is also an Annenberg graduate, and the couple’s son, Eben, earned his undergraduate degree at USC this year.
“I feel like I grew up at USC,” Corii Berg said. “It’s been my and my family’s home for so long. To have this opportunity to be even more engaged and positively impact the University is exciting and also really humbling.”

It was Thursday afternoon when rising junior Phoebe Cook and her dad joined protesters near the Omni Hotel in downtown Los Angeles. They were angered by the death of George Floyd, who was killed in police custody in Minneapolis last week when a former officer pressed his knee against his neck for nearly nine minutes. 
“I was a person. I couldn’t breathe. I begged you for my life. You ignored my cries. You killed me,” read the sign she carried with her through Downtown.
It was the same sign she carried Friday as she protested alone along the intersection of Fifth and Olive streets in a crowd of hundreds who had trickled onto part of the 110 Freeway, later forced to disperse at the sight of rubber bullets. She was hit in the shoulder as she retreated.
It was the same sign she carried Saturday alongside two friends as they walked 10 miles from Pan Pacific Park to Rodeo Drive with the thousands of protesters who joined the L.A. chapter of Black Lives Matter in organized protest. The demonstrations remained peaceful until protesters were met by police who had blocked off the area after those marching had returned to their cars. Officers threw tear gas and shot rubber bullets into the crowd.
Cook is one of dozens of USC students who have joined demonstrations across L.A. and the country in outrage over police brutality following Floyd’s death. Since May 27, the days have been marked by millions who have rallied, marched and protested. Civil unrest has broken out as looting and vandalizing have interrupted peaceful protests and police officers have used tear gas and rubber bullets to break up demonstrations.
But the importance of the message stands above the unrest, Cook said. 
“There’s so many names that I have remembered, so many names that I don’t, of Black people who’ve been killed by police brutality,” said Cook, who is majoring in urban studies and planning. “It just feels exhausting.” 
Floyd’s death came two months after Breonna Taylor was shot eight times by police inside her Kentucky home when they entered late at night with a warrant and three months after Ahmaud Arbery was shot while jogging around his Georgia neighborhood by two white men, including one former police officer. 
It could be anyone, said Jayden Smith, a rising junior majoring in political science who attended a protest in Decatur, Ill., Monday. He said it’s what pushed him to march with hundreds from his own community.
“George Floyd could have been my grandfather; George Floyd could have been my sister; George Floyd could have been me if I was born darker; George Floyd could be my children, depending on the color of their skin when they’re born,” said Smith, who is Black and Korean.
Around L.A. 
In L.A., students joined protests across Downtown, the Fairfax district and Long Beach, carrying signs that read messages such as “Demilitarize the police” and “Prosecute killer cops.”
Frustration reached a new height as demonstrations turned into turmoil Friday, causing L.A. County to implement countywide curfews and Mayor Eric Garcetti to call in the National Guard Saturday to patrol the streets of the city. Many protesters have called out the Los Angeles Police Department for its response to protests, saying that officers have provoked the unrest. In a briefing Monday, Garcetti encouraged individuals to continue to exercise their right to protest peacefully but said action would be taken to prevent looting, vandalism and violence.
Despite the chaos, 2020 graduate Aria Cataño said the protests have been impactful. She saw protesters in the Fairfax district put their own safety in danger to help others amid waves of tear gas and rubber bullets and said she was happy to see some individuals lugging backpacks of water, masks and goggles to hand out to others.
“The protests were honestly some of the most beautiful moments of humanity that I’ve seen in blatant contrast with some of the most brutal moments of humanity that I’ve seen,” Cataño said. “I think it’s that juxtaposition that has really resulted in this general sentiment of confusion and hope but fear, and that’s something that I think will stick with me for a lifetime.” 
Though Cataño said some groups in Long Beach Sunday parted ways from the main rally to loot and vandalize businesses, she said it remained relatively calm and allowed for protesters to put forth their message without disruption. Students said the demonstration remained mostly peaceful as speakers took the podium to speak in support of Black lives and against police brutality.
“One of the most moving parts of the protests was just seeing Black people cry and thank white people and non-Black people by saying, ‘I’ve been out here at Black Lives Matter rallies for years, and it was all Black people. It was new; it wasn’t this big. Nobody had supported us like this. This is the most mobilization we’ve ever had,’” said rising senior Alia Atkins, who attended the Long Beach protest.
Tata Vivas, who also attended the Long Beach protest, emphasized the importance of non-Black activism. She said it was important to her to go out and protest and spread awareness in her own community at USC among Latinx.
“I think this is the first time that I’ve recognized and realized that it’s not about just believing in something and saying, ‘Oh, yeah, I agree that all Black lives matter,’” said Vivas, a rising senior majoring in theatre and narrative studies. “It’s about actually using your voice to try and bring the narrative to the Black community and to the Black voice and to listen and empathize. We’re all learning how to be the best ally.”
By attending demonstrations throughout the week, Cook said, in addition to demanding change, she aimed to document what was going on around her to educate those she knew, especially since misinformation had been  rampant due to the influx of information circulating on social media and other outlets.
“It’s just really tiring to only be able to sit behind a screen and state my support,” Cook said. “I wanted to go out there, and I wanted to show everybody this is what’s really happening.”
Across the country
In Chicago, rising junior Enrique Delgado formed his own protest with his twin brother Eder Saturday and chose to walk around his neighborhood with a sign that read “Black lives matter” on one side and “Fuck 12” on the other. They had decided to refrain from creating a large protest since the neighborhood was home to many undocumented residents. 
“I think we saw that our community wasn’t responding the way that we wanted it to respond to this because there’s a lot of talk in the Latinx community about anti-colorism, but I feel like there’s not enough action. Personally, a lot of people want to talk about change, but nobody really acts on it. And if no one’s going to act on it and somebody has to.”
Delgado and his brother were arrested as they were walking back home at 8:30 p.m. and held overnight, he said.
“We looked at each other in the grass and we were like, ‘Damn, this is actually happening,’” he said. “I just told [Eder], ‘Don’t do anything, like it’s about to be OK.’”
In Washington D.C., rising junior Calvin Carmichael joined peaceful demonstrators in front of the White House Sunday. He chanted and took a knee of silence alongside other protesters, but tensions grew following altercations between some of the crowd and police as protesters were hit by tear gas, Carmichael said.
“I want to experience this firsthand, and I want to be a part of the change,“ said Carmichael, who is majoring in the business of cinematic arts and is a co-director of USC’s Black Student Assembly. “I just wanted to go out there and reiterate what the true message of this is because I feel like with a lot of things going on people are focusing on the looting and how the protests are getting violent, but do not understand that our presence is for equality.”
When Smith took to the streets to march with his neighbors in Decatur, he was overwhelmed by the amount of support he saw among his predominantly white city. Hundreds walked through downtown, including the city’s mayor Julie Moore Wolfe.
“I kind of assumed that a lot of the people I know they wouldn’t speak out, but I’ve been astonished by the amount of white people, people of color, conservatives, liberals, just everybody is speaking out about the injustices,” Smith said. “They want action to be taken. And I think that’s wonderful.”

The USC Athletic Department cut ties Monday with a USC football booster whose tweets athletic director Mike Bohn deemed “abhorrent and blatantly racist” in the wake of nationwide protests over the police killing of George Floyd. 
“Following an immediate investigation into the matter, we informed the individual that their season ticket and Trojan Athletic Fund membership privileges have been revoked and their payments will be promptly returned,” Bohn said in a statement on his Twitter. “Their account has been flagged in our system to prevent future purchases.” 
The booster, identified as Marla Brown, sparked public outrage from USC and surrounding Los Angeles communities when her tweets, most of which were written Saturday, went viral Sunday.
Brown’s tweets gained traction on the social media site when an unnamed user with the tag @TheStolenBeer tweeted a thread displaying several of Brown’s messages. They included, among other statements, calls for looters and protesters to be shot and for President Donald Trump to classify Black Lives Matter as a terrorist organization. 
Brown said that at the time she made the comments, she didn’t see them as racist and now wishes she had clarified that she was not referring to peaceful protesters, but rather to rioters and looters. 
“I did not intend my statements to be racist or directed at a race, but they have been interpreted that way,” Brown told the Daily Trojan. “And, as I said, it is probably my fault if they were misinterpreted because I wasn’t clear in what I was referring to … This is just me being stupid and careless about it.”
One of Brown’s tweets came in a response to Dr. Eugene Gu, the founder of the anti-smoking organization Cool Quit, under an original tweet by Trump.
“People like you promote destruction,” her message read. “It’s no wonder the black community never improves it’s lot. No responsibility. No consequences. At this point they deserve the result.” 
The Daily Trojan asked Brown for comment on that particular tweet. 
“It’s just an observation that I wrote about based upon what I was seeing,” she said. “I don’t think that I’m the only person that shares that view. So it’s an observation that I made and a comment that I made — that I think the community could help each other if we do things peacefully and in a constructive way instead of rioting and looting, as you see what’s going on now.”
Several users called for the University to ban Brown from athletic events and cancel her booster status. One comment, which had 98 likes at the time of publication, read, “She’s only a fan of black lives when they’re entertaining her by playing football at USC.”
Brown identified herself as a Los Angeles Police Department union attorney and a USC football booster in her Twitter bio. Users responded to the original thread calling for others to report her to the California State Bar, but shortly after the tweets went viral on Sunday, she claimed she no longer worked for the LAPD union. Brown has since deleted her Twitter account. 
Brown said she did not feel she was in a position to tell the athletic department whether or not it handled the situation properly by ending their relationship.
“The athletic department did what I think they feel they had to do,” she said. “I think they should’ve reached out to me regardless of their decision — at least contacted me personally. But they didn’t.” The athletic department claimed it did contact Brown directly to inform her of the decision. 
Brown agreed with Bohn’s characterization of the statements as “abhorrent.”
“I’m embarrassed, I’m horrified at what I did and I’m sorry,” she said. “And the consequences are what they are.”
Brown’s since-deleted Twitter bio also described her as a “Fan of USC,” and her profile picture featured herself with former Trojan wide receiver Michael Pittman Jr., a recent Indianapolis Colts draft pick. Pittman retweeted the viral post containing the screenshots of Brown’s messages and added a comment asking her to take down the photo. 
“If you truly believe the things you have said, I politely ask you to take me out of your profile picture,” Pittman wrote in a retweet of the post by @TheStolenBeer. 
Brown responded to Pittman’s message by claiming that the tweets were “made in a fit of anger at circumstances in general” and were not “directed at anyone’s race.” 
“This is disappointing, I know my true Trojan family would never,” Pittman’s original tweet said. “In times like this, it is important for us to stand together.” 
In a Twitter direct message to the Daily Trojan, Pittman said he did not personally know Brown but that she had previously attended a Salute to Troy event, where fans can meet and take pictures with players and coaches. 
Another USC football player, redshirt junior offensive tackle Jalen McKenzie, also expressed his disapproval of Brown’s posts. 
“Yea if you’re like this don’t ask any of us for pics,” McKenzie commented in a retweet of the same viral expository post.
Along with his statement announcing the consequences, Bohn thanked the USC community for helping draw attention to the tweets and emphasized the department’s solidarity with the Black community. 
“Racism and hate speech will not be tolerated,” read the entirety of Bohn’s tweet accompanying an image of the statement.

A petition created Sunday calling for USC and President Carol Folt to acknowledge anti-Black racism in light of nationwide protests of police brutality has amassed nearly 5,000 signatures to date.
Rising senior Jephtha Prempeh, who started the petition, said they decided to write it after growing frustrated by the absence of a message regarding the demonstrations from the University administration, campus organizations and media outlets. Prempeh created the petition before Folt sent a letter about the protests to the USC community Sunday afternoon — six days after the killing of George Floyd, a Black man whose death at the hands of a Minneapolis police officer sparked public outcry.
“Everybody in the country is seeing what is going on right now, and I think it’s wildly irresponsible to be in leadership of so many young people and to not have already felt the need to say something,” said Prempeh, who is majoring in nongovernmental organizations and social change. “A statement should have been made initially, just seeing all this turmoil.”
Born in Minneapolis, Prempeh said they felt a connection to the city, where protests broke out last week after Floyd’s death. Prempeh said the incident, which catalyzed demonstrations across the country, prompted them to reflect on Black students’ place at USC and the experience of being Black at a predominantly white institution.
“As a Black student at USC, I felt like I’ve had a lot of times where my voice has been silenced, where I’ve been underestimated and undervalued and undersupported,” Prempeh said. “Now that we’re all home, and so many people are angry and unemployed and going through so much, I think it’s become a time more than ever to really speak about how to reform this nation.”
Justice Schiappa, a rising senior majoring in writing for screen and television who signed Prempeh’s petition, said the University should have taken more actionable steps toward supporting its Black community.
“It’s very easy [for USC administrators] to say that they support their Black students, but it’s clear that without taking action and being open to the conversation, that they’re not doing things the way they should be,” Schiappa said. “I’d be disappointed in the administration but not completely surprised.”
Ayoni Thompson, a rising senior majoring in popular music performance, also believed Folt’s letter would seem more sincere had it enumerated specific changes in policy and inclusion that the University would enact to better advocate for Black students. Thompson said she would especially have liked USC to clarify whether it would provide financial support to local and national efforts, such as Black Lives Matter and protester bailout funds, dedicated to supporting the demonstrations.
“Long before this conversation even began, we’ve tried to make our voices clear,” Thompson said. “[Folt’s letter] felt very performative, and I’m seeing a trend of … our leaders at school or brands coming out and issuing these blanket statements but not actually doubling down and committing to policy changes, which is what we need.”
Alia Atkins, a rising senior majoring in political science and creative writing who signed the petition after the communitywide email, said she was glad Folt addressed the ongoing protests but hopes the letter marks the beginning of a broader commitment to continuously address racism on and off campus. 
“[I] hope … Folt doesn’t see it as a one-time thing — she made her statement, so she doesn’t have to talk about this ever again,” Atkins said. “In today’s world, you have to be actively and vocally anti-racist.”
Prempeh said they believe USC’s response to the protests is especially important given its large proportion of Black student-athletes, whose programs generate a significant portion of the University’s revenue. They also cited students’ historically prominent roles in demonstrations and movements for social change and the responsibility of schools like USC to stand with the individuals they educate. 
“We look back at the most tumultuous political times and see that college students have often been the ones to incite the change,” Prempeh said. “In a lot of ways, college students are the future of the communities that they live in because you bring so many minds together that are looking to learn and paying to learn. There’s an incentive to actually do something better.”
When reached for comment, the University referenced Folt’s Sunday letter to the USC community and declined to speak further on the petition. 
After the University opted not to elaborate on its response to the petition beyond citing Folt’s letter, several students said they found themselves distrusting the USC administration’s alleged dedication to supporting its diverse student body.
“This is one of the rawest times in my life; I feel completely exposed as a Black person, and I only know that I can trust in places by seeing what they have vocalized about the movement so far,” Atkins said. “Whether or not [organizations] have spoken at all, it’s been my way of acknowledging, ‘This is either a safe place right now, or I’m going to have a hard conversation and then I have to assess whether or not I want to still exist in that space.’” 
Not responding to the petition should not be an option for USC administration, Thompson said. As the University continues to provide limited action toward addressing police violence and anti-Blackness on campus, she said the student body will be more adamant to push for these issues. 
“The longer they wait, the louder we’ll be, so they can wait as long as they want to release a statement — it’s not going to stop us from garnering world attention to what’s going on,” Thompson said. “USC has a big Black community, and USC is in a gentrified area, so their silence is not an option — it’s simply not. There’s no way that their silence isn’t violent against us.”
As student organizations have begun to release statements on their social media platforms, Atkins said she hopes current conversations will broaden education on privilege and racial inequity across USC’s varied populations, particularly campus organizations, like those in Greek life, that hold significant influence within the student body.
“A lot of orgs on campus are vocal about a lot of social justice issues, like the Instagram pages of the sororities always do something for International Women’s Day or they consistently speak up about sustainability, other issues like that,” Atkins said. “You can’t go silent on a race issue just because it’s more uncomfortable for you.” 
Along with providing mental health resources to the student body at this time, Atkins, although not enrolled in summer classes, said she believes the University should consider how protests against police killings of Black people affect students in virtual courses.
“I hope that [for] people who are enrolled in summer classes, then [USC] figure out some kind of way to be understanding — even more understanding than they have been about COVID,” Atkins said. “Right now, people are having a really hard time concentrating. They need to make sure that professors understand that this is a valid excuse for students to be taking mental health days and to be taking off from class during this time.”
In writing the petition, Prempeh said they wanted to bring attention to USC’s responsibility for ensuring its students feel safe and heard. Prempeh said they hope to see the University continue to advocate on behalf of its Black population after widespread protests and collective outrage subside. 
“We have to continue to play an active role in fighting this anti-Blackness, and we have to continue to be on the side of Black students in our student population at large,” Prempeh said. “If any one student doesn’t feel like they are empowered, then that means that we’re not doing a good enough job to all of our students.”

In 1969, there was a man named Curt Flood. 
Flood was a center fielder for the St. Louis Cardinals. Through his first 14 seasons in the league, Flood had established himself as a more-than-serviceable ballplayer. An offensive superstar by no means, Flood’s prowess with the leather — demonstrated by seven consecutive Gold Glove awards from 1963 to 1969 — made him one of MLB’s more coveted center fielders. 
In October right after the culmination of the 1969 season, the Cardinals attempted to trade Flood to the Philadelphia Phillies. Flood did not want to go, for a multitude of reasons — one of which I’ll introduce now, one of which I’ll introduce later. 
Flood, who had no say in the trade, refused to accept the notion that he had no control over his own career path. After unsuccessfully asking MLB Commissioner Bowie Kuhn to declare him a free agent and threatening to retire, Flood filed an antitrust lawsuit against the league. The rule in question: the reserve clause, which essentially gave a team full rights to a player for his whole career unless they decided to move on from or trade the player. There was no free agency. 
After receiving criticism for fighting against the league that was paying him a $90,000 annual salary — then a hefty contract for MLB players — Flood famously said, “A well-paid slave is nonetheless a slave.”
Long story short: Flood lost the suit — the Supreme Court cited a longstanding antitrust exemption for professional baseball — but the momentum his defiance created and the court’s admission that the grounds for the exemption were weak paved the path for free agency to be instituted in baseball in 1976. 
I introduce Flood’s story for two reasons. I’ll start with the first. 
MLB owners and players are currently at each other’s throats over money regarding the return to play amid the coronavirus pandemic. The two parties agreed in late March to a plan that, the players believe, ensures them prorated salaries based solely on the number of games that the league is able to fit in once play resumes. If 82 games are played, players would receive 50.6% of their original 162-game-based 2020 salary. End of discussion.
Owners, meanwhile, believe that the language in the agreement gives them room to renegotiate should the circumstances of the pandemic not allow for fans at stadiums once play resumes. Frankly, it’s a stretch. Owners are trying to walk back on the agreement, and they’ve since mulled or formally proposed disappointing new deals: a 50/50 revenue split between players and owners, bizarre marginal salary cuts in which the highest-paid players could receive somewhere around 15% of their original salary and, announced Monday, full prorated salaries but with the key caveat of a purpose-defeating regular season length of about 50-60 games. 
I’ll put it bluntly: It’s a disgrace. The owners agreed to pay players prorated salaries in March, and now they’re backing out or looking for loopholes. If you find yourself siding with owners because players make millions and they should just be content, don’t fool yourself: About 65% of players make $1 million or less per year, and while I understand that a minimum salary of $563,500 leaves no players particularly pinching pennies, players and billionaire owners are on two separate planes from a financial standpoint.
And this is where Flood comes into play. This war between MLB and its players, this squabble that might prevent baseball from coming back this year altogether, isn’t just about dollars and cents. Though players certainly want to “get mine” — as Tampa Bay Rays southpaw Blake Snell so eloquently put it in a May 14 Twitch stream — the resistance on the players’ part is also about setting precedent. 
Precedent is why MLB players were able to secure free agency and 10-and-5 Rights (full trade veto power if a player has spent 10 years in the league and the last five with his current team), and it’s all because players like Flood stood up and said “fuck no” when the league tried to take advantage of them. It’s why the 1994 strike prevented a salary cap in MLB and players can reel in even more astronomical contracts than their counterparts in the NBA or NFL can.
MLB players caving in and accepting even more dramatic pay cuts just to get back on the field wouldn’t leave them to wonder where their next meal would come from, but it would represent a rollback on the historical resistance that has helped MLB become a relatively player-friendly league and would reinforce the notion that at the end of the day, greedy owners wield all the power.
Good on the players for so far resisting exploitation, and I hope they continue to do so. Flood and similar pioneers are the reasons players now have the platform to provide such resistance, and there are countless reasons to use it.
The second reason I introduce Flood will be much shorter than the first — a somewhat tangential closing thought, if you will. It has less to do with sports, but it feels too necessary to omit.
That other reason Flood opposed the trade: Flood, who was Black, perceived Philadelphia as a racist city with hostile fans, and he didn’t want to live or play there.
What, really, has changed in the United States?
Flood in 1969 was threatened by the same racism that still deeply plagues our country in 2020. Think of that if you find yourself focusing more on the methods of the past few days’ protests than the causes for them. Think about how Flood felt the need to risk his well-paying job in part to fight such racism — similar to the way many Black people right now feel the need to risk their health and safety during a pandemic to protest the racist ideologies that spread like a virus today and did so in 1969, 1869, 1769 and before.
Suddenly, 1969 doesn’t feel so far in the past.
