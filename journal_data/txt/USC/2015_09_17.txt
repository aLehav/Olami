The upcoming game against Stanford on Saturday in the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum will be one of the last before new health restrictions take effect.
On Tuesday, Sept. 8, the Los Angeles City Council voted 14-0 to ban smokeless tobacco at all Los Angeles sporting venues, including those for youth.
The restriction will commence by Jan. 2016, following in the footsteps of similar bans on cigarettes and e-cigarettes.
The ban will apply to the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum, though according to Coliseum general manager Joe Furin, the ban won’t severely affect fans at the Coliseum.
“Smokeless tobacco has had a minimal effect. Rarely do we hear about a customer or a fan using it,” Furin said. “If anything, it would be more the players.”
City council advocated for the ban due to smokeless tobacco’s link to cancer, and determined that athletes should not be publicly endorsing such a harmful product. Additionally, they referred to the substance’s potential for lifelong addiction when justifying the ordinance.
Daniel Durbin, clinical professor of communication at the Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism specializing in sports, said the ban will positively affect audience members and the venues.
“I think the ban adds positively to the environment,” Durbin said. “On one side, it gets rid of a substance that is disgusting, unhealthy and often has been cited as causing cancer of the jaw. It also gets rid of a substance that makes people spit all the time.”
The Los Angeles Dodgers have released a statement to show their support for the ban as well.
Though the ban initially applied solely to baseball stadiums, it was expanded to include all locations where sports are organized.
Jose Huizar, the city council member who authored the motion for the ban, cited a report by the U.S. Center for Disease Control as support for broadening the restriction to all sporting venues. The data from this study revealed that high school athletes use smokeless tobacco twice as much as non-athletes.
Furthermore, 17.4 percent of high school athletes used smokeless tobacco in 2013, Huizar said.
Durbin said smokeless tobacco, poses a danger to Los Angeles youth.
“You socialize people into behaviors by having behaviors within a group or a team that they want to join,” Durbin said. “So if it is presumed that all baseball players chew tobacco, which, at one time, was not far from the truth, [and] if you’re a kid growing up, the assumption is that you, too, will chew tobacco.”

Students venturing onto campus this semester may have noticed a new mode of transportation for students. Commonly referred to as self-balancing scooters or “hoverboards,” the new vehicles resemble a Segway without the handlebars.
According to Laura Lee, a senior majoring in public relations, the vehicles were initially made popular by the company IO HAWK and its active social media marketing strategies. Soon after, companies such as Airwheel also began manufacturing variations of self-balancing scooters, adding to the hype.
“A lot of people know [the vehicles] as IO HAWKs,” Lee said. “They’re really good about sending their product to people that are seen using them, so that more people are starting to use them in general.”
Several students who ride these scooters attributed the increase in riders on campus to the growing number of celebrities who advertise the product through social media.
“I just saw a lot of people, through Instagram, having them, like Chris Brown, Justin Bieber, and people like that,” said Kyle Iverson, a senior majoring in business administration.
Iverson noted that he made the switch over from skateboarding on campus to using the scooter because of how much more fun the latter was.
“It’s just different, you know? It’s nothing like you’ve ever done before, so it’s like going on a roller coaster for like the first time type of feel — it’s really intriguing,” Iverson said. “Getting from Point A to B is just a lot more entertaining.”
Lee, a former cyclist, said she made the switch due to the intuitive technology of the self-balancing scooter.
The self-balancing scooter provides two functions: accelerate and stop. Riders simply just need to lean forward to increase speed and lean back when they wish to slow down or stop. The device makes turns by sensing the rider’s body movements.
“I feel more mobile,” Lee said. “I feel like it’s more of an extension of my legs, whereas a bike is more of a tool that takes me places. It almost feels like I’m a superhero when I am on it in a way, because it’s like only me being on top of one little thing that transports me really fast.”
As the number of self-balancing scooters is growing on campus, Lee acknowledged that the cost of the vehicles could serve as a huge deterrent for students who may wish to join the trend.
“The thing is, it’s a very expensive toy and a lot of younger people want it, but they’re not the ones with the money to be buying it,” she said. “It’s not a product that’s easy to make cheap.”
However, Lee still encourages students to test-drive the vehicle.
“I feel like some people like it, some people don’t. I do think everyone should try standing on it,” Lee said. “I know that some people are scared like [I was], but once I figured out how to do it, I was obsessed.”
Jordan McLaughlin, a sophomore majoring in sociology, believes that the popularity of the self-balancing scooters will continue to grow among students.
“That’s the way the world is,” McLaughlin said. “How technology is moving at this point, I feel like [they are] the future.”

The Mork Chemical Engineering Department hosted a distinguished lecture by Megan L. Robertson from the University of Houston on biorenewable polymers for energy and the environment on Thursday afternoon at Zumberge Hall.
Robertson discussed her research on polymers synthesized from sustainable sources. These polymers are more environmentally friendly than polymers synthesized from fossil fuels.
“Our goal is to make polymers with reduced impact derived from sustainable resources,” Robertson said. “We want to find an alternative to using petroleum.”
Professor Malancha Gupta invited Robertson to speak at USC after meeting her at a chemical engineering conference.
The talk started with Robertson’s description of life cycle analysis, which examines key factors that have environmental and sustainable impact. These factors include energy, water, chemicals, raw materials, end-of-life fate and byproducts. She said chemical companies are working to make their practices more sustainable.
“There has been a large resurgence in sustainability,” Robertson said. “Oil will be around for a long time, but it will become harder to get. There are environmental consequences to obtaining oil in new ways.”
In Robertson’s research, she chose to synthesize these polymers with vegetable oils. The goal is to get these sustainable polymers to act similarly to typical elastomers — plastics that display elasticity.
Elastomers are created in a general sense by melting a polymer so that it can take on any shape. Once the polymers are cooled down, they harden by locking in their structure.
The vegetable oil-based polymer would have to be created through triblock copolymers, polymers with different properties that automatically segregate and create a structural framework. Fatty acid acrylates are the basis for this design.
Robertson explained that there are additional materials other than vegetable oils that can be used, including biomass, vegetable products, plants, polysaccharides and terpenes (a natural form of rubber). For example, cellulose has also been used as an additive to plastic in Dasani water bottles.
Throughout the rest of the presentation, Robertson explained in detail how she compared the properties of plant-based polymers to the properties of petroleum-based polymers. These tests compared structure, mechanical properties and tensile strength.
One of these tests looked at the structure of the newly created polymers by shearing the polymers.
These tests yielded results that showed that work still needs to be done to create applicable plant-based polymers.
“Part of the issue stems from the fact that the molecular weight of the polymer has to reach at least 170 kg per mole to see actual mechanical properties,” Robertson said.
The rest of the event was yielded to questions, during which time audience members asked about the specifics of handling these polymers and how the topics discussed could be applied to their own research projects.
Students studying all facets of chemical engineering and material sciences sat in on the lecture.
Robert Frank-Finney, a Ph.D. student working with Gupta on making polymers from the vapor phase, said he sees the real-world benefits of using plant-based polymers.
“We want to be able to do the same things that petroleum can do and possibly new things,” Frank-Finney said.

A team of USC students was awarded second place on Wednesday for their entry in the Global Grand Challenges Summit Student Day Competition in Beijing on Sept. 13. Iovine and Young Academy sophomore Matthew Stern and 2015 Viterbi alumni Clayton Brand, Michael Maylahn and Dinesh Seemakurty came second to China for their startup, Stasis Labs.
“Stasis Labs offers a connected vitals-monitoring system to equalize the amount of patient information available to doctors around the world,” Maylahn said. “Our vital signs monitoring solution combines custom hardware, a tablet-based patient chart and a web-based patient portal.”
Maylahn said this startup will allow for a more accurate picture of a patient’s health, which will make it easier for caregivers to assess possible problems and, if necessary, intervene earlier. The team plans to integrate the system into the Indian healthcare market this fall and, following that, Maylahn said, aims to create global access by using technology to decrease costs and increase availability of medical care.
Each team at the Student Day Competition was expected to pitch an idea for a startup that addressed one of four topics: sustainability, security, health or joy of living. A panel of scientists, entrepreneurs and engineers judged the entries.
In addition to winning silver in the competition, USC’s team was the top team solving a medical issue.
Along with USC’s group, U.S. teams included participants from Duke University, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, the New York Institute of Technology, the University of Tennessee, Knoxville and Olin College. Student groups from the United Kingdom and China also competed.
“The competition was very inspiring,” Maylahn said. “[It was] wonderful to see so many different engineers of our generation working to solve global issues.”
GGCS is supported by the U.S. National Academy of Engineering, the Chinese Academy of Engineering and the Royal Academy of Engineering. According to the NAE, the competition aims to create a generation of problem-solvers and world-changers.
In addition to the Student Day, a larger conference took place on Sept. 15 and 16, in which 600 experts and speakers addressed topics related to the outlined categories.
Speakers included Alibaba Group founder and Executive Chairman Jack Ma, cybersecurity expert Marie O’Neill of the Queens University Belfast, Director of the U.S. National Institute of Biomedical Imaging and Bioengineering Roderic I. Pettigrew, Minister of the Ministry Environmental Protection Chen Jining and musician Will.i.am. In addition, founder and president of DEKA Research & Development Corp., Dean Kamen, and co-director of the Carbon Mitigation Initiative and director of the Climate and Energy Challenge, Robert Socolow, addressed the summit.

After two dominant non-conference wins over Sun Belt teams, the Trojans will return to the Coliseum for the third straight week, this time to host Pac-12 rival Stanford. The beginning of conference play also marks the start of a series of difficult opponents for the Trojans, including Arizona State, Notre Dame and Oregon.
The Cardinal have not beaten the Trojans since 2012, when No. 2 USC traveled to Palo Alto and fell to No. 21 Stanford.
The Cardinal spoiled USC’s season that year, but a turbulent 2013 Trojan team knocked off No. 4 Stanford the following season under an interim head coach.
“The key for us is to stick to the process and believe in the process to get prepared to play a quality opponent,” head coach Steve Sarkisian said. “Because they are a quality opponent doesn’t mean that we should change. We’ve got the right formula, we’ve just got to stick to it and be committed to it.”
Redshirt senior quarterback Cody Kessler is 2-0 against the Cardinal.
He spearheaded a last-second upset in 2013 with an unranked team to dash No. 4 Stanford’s national championship hopes. Last season, USC and Stanford were ranked No. 14 and No. 13, respectively, and USC again came away with a last-minute 13-10 win in Palo Alto.
This season, however, the teams are ranked farther apart. No. 6 USC is 2-0, boasting a 49 and 50 point win difference while Stanford is heading into this matchup unranked for the first time since 2008, starting the season 1-1.
Kessler is coming off a career-high 410 yards against Idaho, completing 26 of 31 passes with three touchdown passes on the night.
Kessler isn’t complacent, though, and knows that Stanford is an entirely different challenge for the Trojans.
“I think it’s important for us [to improve],” Kessler said. “When Stanford and USC play, it’s always a tough game.”
Meanwhile, Stanford senior quarterback Kevin Hogan and the Cardinal got off to a shaky start, losing their opening game to Northwestern, 16-6.
The offense failed to score a touchdown and Hogan threw for a mere 155 yards and had an interception in the end zone. The defense also struggled, giving up 225 rushing yards.
The Cardinal bounced back, though, with a commanding week two win over UCF, 31-7. Like Kessler, Hogan also had a career night last week, completing 17 of 29 passes for a career-high 341 yards and three touchdowns. The defense bounced back as well, holding UCF to just 30 rush yards.
“They have their style of play, which they’re committed to, and they’re good at it,” Sarkisian said. “But I also don’t want to shift the focus away from us … We’ve got a good formula for success. I think we understand the process now.”
Like in the first two games, Kessler will likely rely on sophomore wide receiver JuJu Smith-Schuster, who appears to be the quarterback’s favorite target. Smith-Schuster has already racked up 14 receptions for 281 yards and three touchdowns in just two games this season.
Since Smith-Schuster has already established himself as a favorite this season, the Stanford defense will likely keep a close watch on the sophomore receiver. This shouldn’t be a problem for the Trojans though, as Kessler will have a trio of options in sophomore Adoree’ Jackson, redshirt sophomore Steven Mitchell Jr. and junior Darreus Rogers.
The Trojans’ run game will face its first real challenge in the Stanford defense that held UCF to just 30 rushing yards.
Redshirt senior tailback Tre Madden and junior tailback Justin Davis will need to step up to maintain USC’s powerful run game against a tough Cardinal defense.
“They’re kind of our new rival,” Davis said. “I would say that. We know they’re going to come with intensity. The past few games, they’ve been really, really close. We’ve been going back and forth for a long time.”
Stanford will be the first able offense the Trojans have played this season.
The defense will face its first real test in fourth-year starter Hogan, who has given the Trojan defense a run for its money in their previous two meetings.
Joining Hogan on offense is running back Christian McCaffrey, who will also test ’SC’s rush defense, something that hasn’t happened so far this season.
Last season, the defense seemed to fall apart in the fourth quarter, so this is their first opportunity to showcase improvement from last season.
“The last time they came down here it came down to a field goal, when we went up there it came down to a field goal,” linebacker Su’a Cravens said. “I’m expecting a tough game, as usual. They’re just physical. They slow the game down, they play at their own tempo. If you’re not going to be as physical as them and match their physically, it’s going to be a long game.”
Though the matchup may not appear exciting on paper, the USC/Stanford rivalry has seen two upsets and one really close game in the past three seasons. Kickoff is set for 5 p.m. in the Coliseum.

In their last tournament before the start of Pac-12 conference play, the USC women’s volleyball team brought the heat to the Southwest and defeated the Oklahoma Sooners in the first game of the 2015 Oklahoma Invitational on Thursday night.
The No. 3-ranked Women of Troy, who were playing just their fourth game away from the Galen Center all season, earned a hard-fought 3-1 victory at the McCasland Field House over tournament host Oklahoma by a 25-14, 23-25, 25-20, 25-20 score. The win over the Big 12 foe now moves USC to a perfect 11-0 record on the season.
While USC’s 30-set winning streak was snapped in the second set, the Sooners weren’t able to sustain that momentum and could not break through the staunch Women of Troy defense.
“I think for the most part, we did quite well,” head coach Mick Haley said. “We had pretty balanced and even scoring from our players throughout the match too — I think we could have finished a little better, but a 3-1 win on the road is pretty good for us.”
USC outblocked Oklahoma 12 to four overall, while also outdigging the Sooners, 49-39.
Junior libero Taylor Whittingham, who leads the Pac-12 in digs with 4.90 digs per set, had a match-high 19 digs to lead USC’s defense. Senior middle blocker Alicia Ogoms, the Pac-12’s leading blocker with 1.68 blocks per set, was yet again a force at the net, tallying 11 kills on a .526 hitting clip and adding a match-high eight blocks. Furthermore, junior middle blocker Elise Ruddins contributed eight kills and no errors on 12 swings for a .667 hitting night while adding four blocks of her own.
On offense, senior outside hitter Samantha Bricio led USC with 24 points with 19 kills on a .366 hitting percentage. Bricio, the nation’s leader in points (6.32) and aces (0.81) per set, added to those numbers with three service aces and four blocks. Freshman Alyse Ford finished second on the team with a career-high 13 kills on an impressive .500 hitting clip.
“The offense was really clicking,” Haley said. “The team hit for an average that is much higher than what teams normally hit.”
The Women of Troy started fast out of the gates, winning the first set 25-14 thanks to a solid .583 team hitting percentage. Bricio hit an impressive .750 in the first frame with six kills and no errors on just eight swings. Her two service aces ended the first set and extended USC’s winning streak to 30 sets in a row.
The second set saw the Sooners put up much more of a fight, however, as USC trailed by as many as six points in the beginning of the set. Back and forth play allowed the Women of Troy to catch up and eventually take the lead at 22-21, but timely Oklahoma kills ended USC’s set winning streak with a 23-25 loss in the second frame.
The 30-set streak that was broken is tied for the second longest ever in program history. The last USC team to win 30 straight sets was Mick Haley’s 2002 National Championship squad, set back in 2002 (Nov. 8-Dec. 13).
After intermission, the Women of Troy shut the door on the Sooners and pulled out the last two sets with a 25-20 win in set three and a 25-20 win in set four to seal the match.
“This is the reason we schedule these kinds of matches before we start conference,” Haley said. “We’re playing away from home, they have a good crowd tonight with their band and the football team harassing us, and everything sets us up for our opening night over at UCLA.”
With the win, USC improved to 4-0 all-time against Oklahoma and extended their winning streak to 11 straight games to stay undefeated on the season.
The Women of Troy will now ride their momentum into an afternoon matchup tomorrow against Big Ten foe Maryland. The Terrapins (10-2) are coming off a 3-0 loss against Washington earlier in the day in this same tournament. USC has won both of the all-time meetings against Maryland, with the last meeting being a 3-0 sweep in September of 2014 in Seattle.
The last game of the Oklahoma Invitational against the Terrapins is set to begin at 2:30 p.m. on Friday.

The Trojans have been fairly environmentally friendly these past couple years, but I think it’s finally time that they just chop down those trees.
Saturday’s game against Stanford is not going to resemble one of the dramatic three-point margin-of-victory barn burners we’ve seen the last two times these teams have met. Nor is it going to be decided by the 50-point margins that USC inflicted on Arkansas State and Idaho, but when the clock hits zero, it will surely be remembered as one thing — a blowout.
The Trojans have cruised through their first two games of non-conference play, while Stanford has struggled early on including a dismal performance resulting in a loss at Northwestern. For that reason, I expect USC to win by a three touchdown or so margin — it could be the first time since 2008 that the team beats the Cardinal by double digits.
The Stanford team coming into town is a physical one — probably the most durable squad USC will face this season — but they are lacking the playmakers that led to a lot of their success last year, especially on offense.
The Cardinal will be without wide receiver Ty Montgomery, who caused a lot of havoc in last year’s meeting, and the team’s leading rusher from last season in redshirt senior running back Remound Wright has struggled to get the running game going, for only 39 yards thus far this season.
Being a program that typically prides themselves on their ground-and-pound running game that milks possession time, the Cardinal are averaging less than 110 yards per game to begin the season.
In the passing game, Kevin Hogan very well might also be one of the most mediocre quarterbacks in all of college football, though his performance against Northwestern showed that he has the potential to slide below average.
Against the Wildcats, Hogan completed only 20 of 35 passes for just over 150 yards to go along with an interception. If Hogan plays anything like that against USC, Stanford head coach David Shaw is going to need to look elsewhere for answers, and as fine as an academic institution Stanford is, I don’t think there’s any level of critical thinking that will solve the problems USC is going to cause him.
His defensive unit comprises some big-time linebackers including Blake Martinez, Kevin Anderson and Peter Kalambayi, but good luck stopping a USC offense that features a Heisman Trophy candidate, a committee of running backs and a couple of the most dynamic and explosive players in college football right now — JuJu Smith-Schuster and Adoree’ Jackson.
The Cardinal will hit hard and probably try to get under the Trojan’s skin, but if they’re unable to slow down the USC offense, Kessler and his weapons are just going to blow by them.
Though this game is their first in conference play and is even considered to be a rivalry game, it won’t be the first true test for the Trojans that many people are saying it will.
Save all that talk for next week on the road at Arizona State and the rest of USC’s schedule, which is ranked the third toughest remaining schedule, according to the ESPN Power Index.
Saturday night, though, will serve as a statement game.
Perfect timing, too. With the game being played in primetime and under the national spotlight, this is USC’S ideal moment to assert their No. 6 national ranking to the College Football Playoff Committee and the rest of country.
Some people have said that USC’s ranking is too high and “undeserved” with their poor quality of opponents thus far. On Saturday night, they will show why they are knocking on the front door of the top five.
Stanford had their chance to have fun nearly a decade ago when it marched into the Coliseum as a 41-point underdog and pulled off a one-point upset against, ending a 35-game home winning streak for a USC team that was ranked No. 1 in the Coaches Poll at the time.
Double-digit favorites once again, you can expect the Trojans to actually cover the spread this time and by much more than 10 points.

The No. 2 men’s water polo team boasts a 6-0 record as they head into their first true challenge of the season in the NorCal invitational this weekend.
The Trojans will open play against an unranked Redlands Saturday morning. If the team is able to win that game, they will then advance to an afternoon meeting with either No. 8 UC Irvine or No. 12 Princeton.
This tournament will provide the team with not only a chance to face off against nationally ranked talent, but also a chance to see what the competition looks like in the Mountain Pacific Sports Federation.
All of the teams in the conference will be present at the tournament aside from No. 5 Pacific.
Players on the team have expressed the difficulty of suddenly switching gears from what could be considered lower-level tournaments to one that brings in top national talent.
“These past games are good preparation for the tournament,” sophomore All-American Mihajlo Milicevic said. “We use these games to try our plays, and we have a lot of new guys so we use the games to see how we play together.”
Learning to play together has been a focus of a very young Trojan squad, and this weekend will be a test of the preparation they have gone through this year in practice.
“During practice we work on always being prepared,” sophomore Lachlan Edwards said. “Always putting yourself in the position you will be in during the game and knowing what’s at stake because making mistakes against lesser teams might not hurt you but against the better teams, they will score on you for it. It just makes it so much harder to catch up.”
The tournament field is deep, featuring 15 of the top 20 teams in the nation.
The Trojans are hoping to build on last season’s fourth place finish at the NorCal Invitational where they suffered a semifinal loss to UCLA and a third-place game loss to Cal.
“If I look in the guy’s faces, it shows that we are excited,” Milicevic said. “I am very excited to go and show my best.”
The Trojans are coming off of a strong opening to their season not just as a team but as individuals.
Five of the top 25 goal-scorers in the MPSF represent the Trojans, leading to one of the most well-rounded scoring attacks in years.
The crew is led by junior Blake Edwards, who is No. 2 in the conference with 25 goals already this season, averaging just over four a game. Sophomore Matteo Morelli is also in the top 10 for the Trojans at No. 6 with 17 goals thus far this season.

The Trojans are 2-0 and could face their first test of the season as they get ready to take on their first Pac-12 opponent in Stanford. Daily Trojan columnists Luke Holthouse, Nick Barbarino and Jake Davidson join Daily Trojan sports editor Darian Nourian to discuss what to anticipate from both teams when they clash this Saturday.
What should we expect to see from the Trojans against Stanford?
Davidson: The Trojans will probably come out somewhat conservatively against the Cardinal, which is unfortunate, but Stanford generally dictates the tempo of their opponent. It would be great to see coach Steve Sarkisian continue the role of aggressor and attack Stanford with the incredible offensive weapons at his disposal. The Cardinal are experienced and fundamentally sound but their coach David Shaw plays to win. If USC can play its game and drive the ball down the field, I expect to see a two to three touchdown victory.
Barbarino: This game is going to be won in the trenches. In week one, Northwestern exposed the Stanford defensive line, gaining 225 yards on the ground. I expect the Trojans to enter the game with the same mindset. Expect a lot of running from the trio of Justin Davis, Tre Madden and Ronald Jones III. All that running attack should open up the play-action for Cody Kessler.
Holthouse: I think the Trojans will come out with fire against Stanford. Maybe not quite as much as the last time they hosted the Cardinal, but this is still a legitimate rival. Defensively, USC has a really interesting matchup. Despite its power-run mentality, Stanford’s offense has struggled in the red zone against USC. I don’t know if USC should be more worried about overloading the box or just keeping the offense in front of it. Offensively, though, the Trojans should focus on just keeping possession of the ball. Consistently moving the chains will be more important than the occasional explosive play.
Nourian: Expect the Trojans to come out fast. The difference between this year’s USC team and last year’s team is that they’re much more comfortable in the up-tempo system and with the way this offense has been playing lately, I don’t see them slowing down against the Cardinal on Saturday. Stanford will try and slow the game down with its ground-and-pound running game, but the USC defense’s front seven has seen a lot of bright spots in its first two games and seems ready to answer that call. I also wouldn’t be surprised if offensive coordinator Clay Helton took a couple shots down the field early in the game — when you have a Heisman Trophy candidate quarterback in Kessler and explosive talent on the outside with JuJu Smith-Schuster, chances are you’ve got a pretty good shot at breaking a big play.
Who will be USC’s greatest impact player? Who will be Stanford’s impact player?
LH: If Stanford is going to stay in this game, it certainly will need a big day from quarterback Kevin Hogan. The last two years, Stanford has outgained the Trojans but had two more turnovers. I don’t think Stanford has the offensive firepower to match USC’s yardage, but Hogan will have to protect the ball for Stanford to have a chance. For USC, I hope the game doesn’t get to this point, but if it requires a big field goal like the last two times, it will be interesting to see if Alex Wood has the same killer instinct against Stanford as his predecessor, Andre Heidari.
DN: Kessler’s going to get his numbers and protect the ball, but USC’s committee of running backs are going to play a vital role against Stanford. In its first two games, USC averaged just under 235 rushing yards a game on the ground and will be expected to have a strong performance this week in order to balance out the passing game. There’s no doubt that the Trojans’ running game has enhanced the passing game, opening up a lot of opportunities for play-action passes down the field. USC’s depth at the running back position is its best in years with veterans Madden and Davis setting the foundation and freshmen Jones III and Aca’Cedric Ware making big contributions early on. On the other hand, Stanford is going to need a monster game from sophomore running back Christian McCaffrey, who leads the team in rushing and will have to rack at least a century on the ground if the Cardinal want to have a chance to win.
NB: USC’s impact player is going to be Ronald Jones III. Jones leads the Trojans in yards per game (84.5) and total rushing yards (169). With Madden and Davis handling a majority of the carries, Jones has been able to take advantage of a tired defense and should see plenty of chances against the Cardinal. Stanford’s X-factor will be Kevin Hogan. After struggling against Northwestern — only managing 155 yards — Hogan exploded for 341 yards and three touchdowns against UCF.
JD: I’d say it’s a position group more than a specific player. If USC’s offensive line can play like they did against Idaho and not Arkansas State, USC will win. If they can’t handle the pressure from Stanford’s grizzled front seven, it will be a long day for Kessler, who has a penchant for holding onto the ball too long when he is feeling the heat.
Will Stanford test the Trojans for the first time this year?
NB: This Stanford team is going to test USC. Don’t let the week one loss to Northwestern fool you; this is still a well-coached team that knows how to win big games. In their past five contests, neither team has won by more than seven points and the Trojans have escaped as winners for two consecutive games, thanks to two Heidari field goals.
JD: This team is wildly inferior to the team USC upset in 2013 at the Coliseum. Shaw’s antiquated coaching style cost him the Rose Bowl against Michigan State and last year’s game against USC. They lack the playmakers (Tyler Gaffney, Ty Montgomery, Toby Gerhart, Andrew Luck) that made the offense go, and on defense, while they are still stout, they lack the playmakers like Shayne Skov and Henry Anderson who made this team so dominant. The ground-and-pound game still works, but not if you couple it with other questionable coaching decisions that Shaw seems to make on a weekly basis.
DN: Stanford will test USC mentally but not physically. This Cardinal team is a solid Pac-12 team, but it has looked slow thus far this season while USC has been flying on cruise control. It will be good for the Trojans to finally face a credible opponent and from a game strategy and game management standpoint, Sarkisian’s team will have to learn to adjust to what opposing Pac-12 teams throw at them. However, this USC team is deep, explosive and a lot more confident than this Stanford team coming to the Coliseum this weekend. And with that, the Trojans will blow by Stanford.
LH: I think Stanford is a legitimate top 20 team nationally, and No. 6 is probably a little high for USC after two non-tests, but USC definitely has the edge. Before the season, I had this as my most concerning conference matchup for the Trojans, but the Northwestern loss has me second-guessing that. So yes, this is not the best Stanford team USC has faced in recent memory, but it will absolutely still be a test.

These days, there’s really no excuse not to be a part of a music streaming service, especially with all the free ones out there. In my opinion, some are certainly better than others. I’ve listed the top five streaming services, ranked in order of quality:
Pros: Songza offers you a variety of playlists based on a number of categories, such as mood, genre, time period and other miscellaneous categories. I’ve found some solid songs through this service. If you find yourself using it, I personally recommend looking for songs through mood; they’re really good at finding just the right songs to reflect how you’re feeling.
Cons: The biggest downside to this service, aside from the limited skips, is the fact that you can’t listen to an individual artist. A certain artist or song you might like could be in a playlist, but there will never be a playlist dedicated to a specific musician.
Pros: Aside from helping local or aspiring musicians get their work out in the world, it has a lot of stuff you would never hear on radio or any other streaming service. I’ve found a lot of remixes of songs on here that I didn’t know I needed in my library until I heard them. Some popular artists will even upload a preview of a song exclusively to Soundcloud before they release it, or they’ll just release the song outright. It’s free, and it’s also mobile, so you can listen to your favorite unsigned artists on the go.
Cons: As far as everything else goes, you could do better. There are playlists, but nothing like what other streaming services offer. For instance, you probably won’t find a collection of greatest hits by your favorite artist here.
Pros: This is probably a first for a lot of longtime-music-streamers. If you don’t know what Pandora is, it’s a free Internet streaming service that lets users look up their favorite artists and songs and listen to a station with similar artists or songs in addition to other songs by the original artist. Where Pandora shines is the variety of stations you can find.
I’m sure everyone and their mother has at some point told you about “this totally unknown station that nobody knows about that plays the best songs.” They actually might be telling the truth, and you might even be that person one day when you stumble across a station that plays hit after hit after hit. If you don’t find it, Pandora lets you create your own station tailored around an artist or song of your preference, and they’ll add music that sounds like it. Pandora can be accessed on the Internet, on your phone and, depending on the make and model, in your car.
Cons: The only downside to Pandora is that you are given a limited amount of skips and you’re occasionally forced to listen to ads. But for a free service with tons of variety, you could do worse.
Pros: It’s a paid subscription, but there’s a free three-month trial to see if you like Apple’s latest and greatest attempt to take over the music streaming business. Apple has taken a lot of the stuff that worked with iTunes and moved it over to Apple Music while adding a few new features that you won’t find in iTunes. In addition to neatly organizing all the music you have in your phone’s library, Apple Music can recommend songs, playlists and artists based on artists, genres or songs you already like. 
Where Apple Music separates itself from its competition is in a few cool features, such as the ability to stream a music video for free at any time. Probably the coolest feature that’s exclusive to Apple Music is the ability to view behind-the-scenes information about your favorite artists who post to Apple Music. 
In the keynote where Apple debuted the service, users could see an artist upload photos of them in the studio, goofing off, a brand new song or posting lyrics to a song that hadn’t even been written yet. Siri also works with Apple Music, and pretty much everything you can imagine Siri doing with Apple Music is a possibility, including playing the number one song from a certain date. You can also stream radio stations that are exclusive Apple Music and create and share playlists with your friends and the world. 
Cons: Apple Music is looking to be a very good paid music streaming service, but a lot of the things they offer have been done before, which brings me to my next service.
Pros: Anything any streaming service has done, Spotify can do better. Admittedly, I’m biased towards Spotify since it’s the service I use the most, but it’s nothing short of a fantastic streaming service. Nearly every artist with every song, album and collaboration that they’ve made is on this service. Radio streaming, the ability to see what your friends have listened, the ability to create, share and name any playlist with any amount of songs, and the ability to follow your favorite artists and friends are just part of what makes Spotify top-dog.
My favorite and main reason for using Spotify, however, is the ability to download playlists to your phone and computer that can be played without an Internet or mobile connection. Spotify also offers the best way to discover new music by offering a seemingly endless amount of playlists that the staff has created, or the infinite amount of playlists that users have created themselves. Any occasion or genre or mood that you can think of, Spotify has a playlist for.
Cons: The main drawbacks to the service are the lack of some major artists (Taylor Swift, why are you punishing us?), and the amount of mobile data it takes up if you’re not listening while connected to Wi-Fi.
More pros: Spotify has a free and premium version. The free version is similar to Pandora, and the premium version has a free trial. But like Netflix, it’s a gateway drug that you’ll be hooked on in no time. The good news is that Spotify offers a student discount that brings the price down to five dollars a month, which is nothing compared to all the content and features that Spotify gives you, and it’s another reason why Spotify is the best music streaming service out there at this time.

My mother has always been a great fan of magical realism. I think part of the unavoidable rebellion of growing up and being a teenager led me to refuse to ever read these bizarre, mystical novels she was constantly telling me about. However, last year, I finally came around and read my first book of the genre: Like Water for Hot Chocolate. I immediately fell head over heels with the gorgeousness of magical realism, with its incredibly rich descriptions of the sensory aspects of the world and fairytale fantasy. I quickly devoured other novels from the genre, all from classic Latin American authors such as Isabel Allende and Gabriel Garcia Marquez. I loved the passion and culture in these novels, and completely understood why the Latin American magical realism is often considered to be the best in the world.
That’s why when I came across Angela Carter, I was hesitant. My best friend had told me that if I loved magical realism, I should try reading something by the renowned English author. I didn’t see how the spirit and heat that worked so well in the Latin American landscape could be as effective in my native country, where the constant rain and bad weather seemed anything but magical. Still, while exploring a bookstore in Norway, I stumbled upon Nights at the Circus by Carter. The description had me hooked, and I thought I might as well give it a try. I’m so pleased that I did, because it ended up being one of the most exquisite, intoxicating and wildly exciting books I have ever read.
The story follows an American journalist, Jack Walser, as he interviews the notorious Sophie Fevvers, the star of a circus act who is about to leave her native London to tour Russia. Fevvers, nicknamed the “Cockney Venus,” has gained the attention of the world because she supposedly has real wings and is able to fly. As Walser becomes unintentionally drawn to this brassy, yet charming woman, he poses as a clown in order to follow her around Russia as part of the circus and reveal once and for all whether she is truly a magical being, or simply a hoax.
The incredible plot is itself astonishing and Carter, truly a master of her craft, manages to bring magic to the slums of London and the depths of Siberia with as much grace and beauty as any Latin American author. What I loved about this book was how different it was from any other type of magical realism I had ever read. Truly, the only fantastical element is Fevvers’ feathered disfigurement, but even the reality of this is constantly questioned and debated throughout the novel. Carter keeps the rest of the story grounded in reality, with Walser’s attempt to keep his grasp on the plausible anchoring the novel. Carter uses the magical elements to discuss more serious topics, specifically the emancipation of women. Women’s rights are hotly debated throughout the novel, and many critics see Fevvers’ ability to fly as a metaphor for her escaping the bonds of patriarchy in turn-of-the-century Europe.
Carter keeps the momentum going, not merely through the physical movement of the circus troupe through London, St. Petersburg and then Siberia, but also through her magnificent language. From the opening of the novel — “‘Lor’ love you, sir!’ Fevvers sang out in a voice that clanged like dustbin lids” — Carter’s characterization is wholly believable and her ability to paint vivid pictures mentally is superb.
Perhaps my only critique of this novel is that it was all too broad. Or, perhaps more accurately, I think that Carter could have added at least a hundred pages and gone into more detail on some of the vast experiences and action that takes place in the novel. Still, the relative shortness of the novel means that there is never a dull moment. From tiger attacks to brothels to the terrible psychological pain of the clowns, Nights at the Circus is a grand, sweeping piece of literature.
For me, this book wasn’t just an enjoyable read, it was also an exploration of what was happening in my hometown of London at the very end of the 19th century. Carter’s vivid descriptions extend to more carnal and everyday things such as food, toilets and hygiene. I found it incredibly interesting how she describes in detail the bacon sandwiches, sardines and tea that Fevvers devours. In some ways this is so similar to what we still eat and drink today, yet, in particular, much greasier, dirtier and, all in all, more disgusting to the modern reader. Of course, this extends to questions of waste and cleanliness as well. I always find it irritating when authors of historical fiction ignore so much of the day-to-day aspects of life that mark the time period as so different from ours, but Carter made me feel like I was standing in 19th century London, fully aware of all the sights, smells, sounds, tastes and textures.
Nights at the Circus manages to both be one of the most magical books I have ever read and also one of the most realistic. Carter’s blending of the fantastical and the almost gratingly vivid conditions of everyday life are both conflicting and yet somehow wonderfully complementary. This was something I had never encountered before in magical realism and is what makes this book so worth reading.

With fall fast approaching, it is time to decide what the “song of summer” was. Luckily, Billboard’s Hot 100 is still tracking this summer’s hits. The top two spots are currently occupied by The Weeknd. Born Abel Tesfaye,  the Canadian-Ethiopian R&B sensation ended the summer with the release of his latest album, Beauty Behind the Madness, last August, which scored the No. 1 spot on the Billboard 200 two weeks in a row. The Weeknd made Billboard history Wednesday as he became “the first solo male to top the Artist 100, Hot 100 and Billboard 200 in the same week.”
The Weeknd’s singles “Can’t Feel My Face” and “The Hills” rose from the No. 2 spot to No. 1 and No. 3 to No. 2, respectively, dominating Billboard’s list; he broke the record this past Monday as only the tenth artist to secure both No. 1 and 2 hits. The last group to nail this victory was the Black Eyed Peas back in 2009 with “Boom Boom Pow” sitting at No. 1, followed by “I Gotta Feeling.” T.I. was the last solo male artist to lock No. 1 and 2 down in 2008 with “Live Your Life” featuring Rihanna and “Whatever You Like.” Other musicians possessing this top two record within Billboard’s 57-year history are Akon, Mariah Carey, Usher, OutKast, Nelly, Bee Gees and The Beatles.
All other records aside, The Weeknd holds seven other songs from his newest album on the Billboard’s Hot 100, making him the latest musical icon reigning as “The King of Pop” since Michael Jackson.
Another household name in pop music is Justin Bieber, whose newest single “What Do You Mean?” was released the same day as Beauty Behind the Madness. The upbeat and infectious song sits at No. 3, having dropped from No. 1 last week. Bieber, who has not produced an album since Journals in 2013, is preparing fans for his fourth album, rumored to be released by the end of the year. After releasing the No. 1 single from the newest album, No. 4 title-holder Bieber has a chance to redeem his No. 2 spot peak with the remaining track list.
Along with Bieber, Fetty Wap is making his way to the top of Billboard’s Hot 100, securing three singles in the top 20 alone. His claim to fame, “Trap Queen,” rests comfortably at No. 18 after having been on this list for the last 34 weeks. Fetty Wap’s newer songs, “679” featuring Remy Boyz has surpassed the last one, landing at the No. 8 spot, while “My Way” featuring Monty was No. 15.
Chart highlights include Drake’s No. 16 song “Hotline Bling” as both the streaming and digital gainer, achieving the largest surges in streaming and unit purchases. The Weeknd’s No. 2 hit “The Hills” is featured as the airplay gainer, winning the “largest increase in audience.” Aside from these bigger names in the music industry, Billboard awards one hotshot debut, or “highest ranking new-entry,” which is Travi$ Scott and his new song “Antidote” this week. His latest album, Rodeo, was released earlier this month and holds the No. 3 spot in its first week on the Billboard 200 list. Similar to The Weeknd’s humble career beginnings, Scott dropped his second mixtape Days Before Rodeo Aug. 18, only 17 days shy of the release of his album. Days Before Rodeo has been nominated as Best Mixtape for the 2015 BET Hip Hop Awards.
Like Scott, newer artists have begun to emerge from Billboard records, including Hailee Steinfeld and her single “Love Myself,” which peaked this week as No. 36 after coming in last week at No. 44. Steinfeld, besides making big gains in performance, has grown in popularity due to her role in Pitch Perfect 2 as the youngest Barden Bella, Emily Junk. She is still acting while producing her first album after experimenting with Shawn Mendes on an acoustic cover of his single “Stitches,” which is currently ranked No. 14 on Billboard’s Hot 100.
With 2015 drawing to an end, artists are still producing as many singles and albums as they can, signing off the end of an era of breaking musical records and watching singers like The Weeknd soar on every list possible. Tesfaye is paving the way for new, innovative artists to find their spotlight and nab that No. 1 spot.

Long gone are the days of Los Angeles being seen as a haven for comfortable living. Instead, the city is accurately portrayed as a place in which traffic congestion and the tireless procedures within the public transportation system are constant. The busyness of Los Angeles traffic often detracts potential workers and families from visiting or purchasing property for a permanent place of residence. If residents across Los Angeles were forced to choose between riding a bicycle or driving a vehicle everyday, it is likely they would choose the latter due to convenience.
In an effort to combat decades of complaints from city workers, residents and visitors, the Los Angeles City Council, in conjunction with Mayor Eric Garcetti, have worked to create and implement the Los Angeles Mobility 2035 plan. The plan — commonly referred to as MP2035 — will execute a complete redesign of the streets across L.A. neighborhoods by manipulating traffic speed and by adding hundreds of miles in bus and bike-only lanes. But rather than adequately addressing concerns for traffic congestion and mobility, the plan worsens traffic congestion by increasing new measures for safety protocol by adding bike and bus lanes.
The plan details an added 300 miles of protected bike lanes, 117 miles of bus-only lanes and an additional 120 miles of bus lanes that will be created for rush-hour-only use, according to the Los Angeles Times. According to figures printed by the Times, Angelenos will be expected to increase their walking by 38 percent, transit use by 56 percent and bicycling by 170 percent if the plan is completed by 2035.
The plan is at best a failed attempt to combat three of the most difficult transportation issues in Los Angeles: traffic congestion, air pollution and immobility due to vehicle operation speed. The motives behind the plan are not to increase the amount of cars on the road, but to increase the amount of transportation alternatives such as walking and cycling. As any good plan should include alternatives, MP2035 fails to offer viable ones. Though I commend the city’s efforts toward creating a new plan to combat regional transportation issues, it doesn’t do the city and its residents justice. For those who already take public mass transit to and from work, the proposal will be beneficial. But for the other majority of residents and workers who commute from far distances, accessibility becomes a major issue.
For instance, USC student workers who make the daily commute from campus to Hollywood to work will experience extreme traffic and greater obstacles in accessing their workplace. This creates the unnecessary burden that makes it increasingly difficult for students to balance both a work and academic life. As Los Angeles employs over 4.2 million workers, we cannot expect all to use mass transit for work. Thus, greater wait times and decreased per capita delay while waiting in traffic are inevitable. This plan, a feat for the environment and a stride toward a vehicle-free city is ambitious, but inconsiderate and, most of all, impractical.
Rather than its marketed purpose — to decrease traffic waiting times — the plan increases traffic, intensifies congestion and promotes faster vehicle operating times. Sam Schwartz, a contributor to the Los Angeles Times and former New York City traffic commissioner and the N.Y. City Department Transportation’s chief engineer, explained a 2012 University of Michigan study in conjunction with the University of Washington to identify whether increased speed or increased proximity heightened accessibility. The study proved that proximity is 10 times more important than increased speed.
Last month, the Los Angeles City Council approved the plan by marketing it as a tactic to improve city life conditions. In opposition to the proposal, a nonprofit group named, “Fix the City,” filed a suit in court last Wednesday, explaining that the plan only promotes the spread of city-wide air pollution and will undoubtedly lead to more traffic congestion. In the city’s draft Environmental Report, it detailed the downfalls of the plan which included slower response times for emergency vehicles, heavier congestion and more noise from buses.
Proponents of the plan are in favor of MP2035 because of its increase in safety measures as it follows Mayor Garcetti’s “Vision Zero,” a personal and communal mission to reach zero traffic-related deaths in Los Angeles by 2035. Don’t get me wrong: MP2035 is the start of a brighter and more environmentally friendly future, which is a feat for our city to say the least. By 2035, the plan is also geared toward greater bike-sharing programs. But if we’re talking accessibility and convenience for Angelenos, this plan has got it all wrong.

Get a clue. People are sick of getting run over in L.A. Maybe we should tear down all the buildings and pave everything so cars can just go everywhere crashing into each other and killing everyone, would this make it easy for you to get where you are going?
A metropolis with over 10 million residents can not function efficiently and sustainably if every person insists on having their own private vehicle.  Our city thought in the past that if you just add more lanes all our traffic problems will be solved.  Well, if you look at freeway traffic now, that strategy hasn’t worked after 50 years of trying.  Do we continue the same method and expect different results or do we change our thinking?
Traffic is only going to get worst on roads with or without MP2035.  At least with MP2035 people will finally be able to choose a safer, more sustainable, reliable, cheaper, and healthier alternative by taking a bike or metro.
Sorry Sarah Dhanaphatana, but this city will not go backwards in its progress because of short-sighted people like you being inconvenienced. 
Traffic is not the problem Ms. Dhanaphatana. The problem is that too many people are driving private automobiles. Traffic is a symptom of that problem. Pollution, traffic deaths, and sprawl are also symptoms, and Mobility Plan 2035 represents the city’s recognition, finally, that in one of the densest urban areas in the nation, perhaps encouraging everyone to drive private automobiles doesn’t make very much sense. So the plan gives us alternatives. 
Will MP2035 make it less convenient for you, Sarah Dhanaphatana, to drive to any given destination in Los Angeles? Probably. 
Does MP 2035 prioritize safety, environmental concerns, public health, and general quality of life, while at the same time taking into consideration Los Angeles’ probable population growth in the next twenty years? Yes. And, yes, at times that happens at the expense of the convenience of the individual motorist. 
Is it all worth it? Absolutely. The individual motorist is not the center of the universe. And cars and auto-centrism (as an ethos) do so much harm to our city. Any effort to ween Angelenos off their addiction to cars should be resoundingly applauded.
This is ridiculous… the example you cite (USC to Hollywood) is literally one of the EASIEST trips to make via Public Transportation. Expo Line to Red Line, no problem.
I was just about to make a comment about how easy it is to get to Hollywood from USC without a car, but you beat me to it. I did it every day for 9 months. took me 30-40 minutes and never had to worry about traffic. This article is silly time

Students might be among peers in the classroom, but not everyone is equal.
The college class structure — often a stereotypical lecture in which a professor drones on in front of an overwhelming mass of students — is biased toward those who are affluent, white, male and, often, extroverted. Large lectures and voluntary participation might be the conventional modus operandi, but it’s the responsibility of universities like USC to ensure that class structure does not encourage discrimination.
In a recent piece for The New York Times, “Are College Lectures Unfair?” columnist Annie Murphy Paul contends that the current lecture format puts racial minority groups, women and low-income students at a significant disadvantage. Paul says that this is no fault of instructors themselves, only of the actual structure of classes. In this passive class structure, a high-pressure atmosphere contributes to less participation by underrepresented student groups due to a lack of a sense of belonging. The piece cites a 2014 study that found that though women make up 60 percent of university introductory biology courses, they only accounted for 40 percent of class participation.
Another rarely mentioned marginalized group in this class lecture format, is introverted students. In her book Quiet: the Power of Introverts in a World that Won’t Stop Talking, Susan Cain says that your personality type defines you more than any other factor, thus making introverted people already at a major disadvantage in the extroverted world we live in.
“Introverts living under the Extrovert Ideal are like women living in a man’s world,” Cain told Forbes in 2012. “Our most important institutions are designed for extroverts. We have a waste of talent.”
One of these institutions is the University. Despite a commitment to meeting the educational needs of all students, USC still clings to an outdated structure that favors a small group of students.
There’s no question that engagement and participation in classwork and class discussion is beneficial for all students, but the current system bars some students from this enrichment.
Take, for instance, the idea of the participation grade in the college lecture structure. The University penalizes students in a situation where the odds are systematically stacked against them. Some are introverts by nature and feel uncomfortable speaking up in front of other students. Others have less to say simply because they come into a class without the background knowledge that an affluent student who attended an elite private school might have. Either way, the current system does not cater to these students’ unique educational needs.
The University has taken some steps toward a more active learning environment by offering smaller seminar sections compared to classes at other universities. But it’s more than just classroom size — the University should replace the traditional lecture structure with repeated engagement with material and without the assumption that students fully understand background information.
It’s easy for a university to hold lectures instead of seminars that foster a low-pressure environment. It’s easy for a professor to call on the overeager student in the first row, stretching their hand up as if to reach the ceiling. It’s easy for TAs to simply spend discussion time regurgitating the lecture. In other words, it’s easy to stick to the status quo.
It’s often said that once students get  to college, they are responsible for their own education. They can choose whether to go to class, whether to do the readings, whether to turn in assignments. But, simply placing the burden on students, when many are systematically discriminated against, is not fair. USC has a duty to consciously act in a way that gives the greatest number of students the most effective learning experience.
The University claims it is committed to diversity, but it is simply not enough to attract a diverse group of students to campus. Once they are here, the University must also make sure their opportunities are no less than their classmates’.

The nighttime festivities in Spain don’t begin until around 1 a.m. so make sure to take your “siesta.” Janis Yue | Daily Trojan
9:12 a.m.: I wake up for my 10 a.m. “Spanish Composition” class after hitting the snooze button a couple times. For breakfast, I eat a small piece of toast, yogurt and sip a little cup of coffee. Spaniards like their coffee super concentrated, which is absolutely fine by me.
10:00 a.m.: After a five minute walk to the University of Deusto from my apartment (passing by an emerald-colored river and the undulating architecture of the world-famous Guggenheim), where I begin class. My professor, who insists we call her Ana instead of “profesora” since she is neither “vieja” (old) nor “antipático” (unfriendly), goes over differences in punctuation between Spanish and English. She keeps the class engaged with her animated gestures and uninhibited humor.
1:00 p.m.: After my conversation and grammar classes, I head home, letting myself get distracted by little Spanish pastry shops and clothing stores for a bit. I meet a kindhearted Venezuelan storekeeper who tells me to come back when there aren’t any people in the store so that he can help me practice my Spanish. The store shuts down for siesta around 2 p.m., and I go home and take a short nap as well.
2:30 p.m.: My host mom and I have lunch, which is honestly one of the most enjoyable parts of my day. Every lunch consists of three courses. Today, I have a garlicky mix of squash and tomato for my first plate. For the next, I have a beautiful piece of white fish dressed in a light herby sauce. For dessert, I have a mini-flan. We talk about her work, and I tell her about some of the things I do at USC and with my family back home — it’s great chance to keep practicing my Spanish.
3:30 p.m.: My friends from the program and I decide to take advantage of the sun and soak up some rays at the beach. We take the metro for about 20 minutes to Playa de Sopelana, a gorgeous crystal blue beach, where we tan among many topless women (a cultural norm here).
7:30 p.m.: We hop on the metro to go back home and each go our separate ways back to our apartments. My 7-year-old host sister greets me with a huge smile and “Hola!” followed by “Lucha!” She’s referring to the sparring game in Wii Sports, which we play often (probably because she somehow beats me every single time). This time is no different.
9:00 p.m.: I do a couple grammar exercises for homework. At 9:45, my host family and I have dinner, another delicious meal. There is lively conversation, and a Spanish fútbol (soccer) game plays on the TV in the background, because soccer is a religion here. My host parents ask me many, many times if I want more food.
10:30 p.m.: My American friends and I meet up with some local Spaniards in the streets of Bilbao to drink some kalimotxo (a popular mix of red wine and Coca-Cola) before we head to the discoteca around midnight or 1:00 a.m. We dance the night away.
At USC, I often found myself getting trapped in a “culture of stress,” where I never felt like I was doing enough unless I was getting less than six hours of sleep a night or passing up on spending time with family and friends. Here in Spain, I’ve reoriented my focus. I’ve already gained a greater appreciation for the little moments of daily life, as well as meaningful, honest interactions with other humans.
As many of my friends have told me, in Europe, people work to live, rather than living to work.
And I’ve never felt more alive.

It’s past midnight, but you’re starving. Don’t fret, here’s a list of places in L.A. where you can eat long after it gets dark. Flickr/Creative Commons
As Trojans we tend to stay up really late. Whether studying in Leavey Library or partying with friends – you are bound to get hungry. Here’s a list of places near campus and in Downtown L.A. where you can walk, Uber or have food delivered when you get hungry:
Ground Zero: On campus café Ground Zero has a hip atmosphere to study and have coffee, or savor their amazing milkshakes. There are also open mic nights, movie screenings and more. Ground Zero is a great place to take a break from your overheated dorm room or the library and is open until midnight every day.
Traditions: For the 21+ college students — you can get a libation and good bar food at Traditions, affectionately known as Traddies, This underground sports bar has flat screen TVs, an inviting bar and spacious booths. Try Chef Henry’s new mouthwatering wings, street tacos and specialty sandwiches. This on-campus bar is open Monday through Friday until 11 p.m., but open until midnight on Thursday nights.
Kogi: Kogi is a Mexican-Korean fusion food truck every Angeleno must try. It is located close to campus on Hoover Street every Tuesday from 10-11 p.m.. I highly recommend the Korean BBQ-style short rib taco served on two crispy grilled homemade corn tortillas.
El Huero: If you prefer authentic Mexican food, you should make your way to El Huero, formerly known as Chano’s. A great place to stop for a late night bite to eat with good prices, El Huero is located conveniently close to the Row and open 24/7.
Garage Pizza: For the nights when pizza is all you crave, Garage Pizza is open 24 hours a day and they deliver. It is New York-style pizza with many delicious toppings, as well as vegan options.
LA Café: This café has a variety of food, including salads, sandwiches, burgers and an amazing lobster grilled cheese. It is also open 24 hours a day and delivers, making it a great option for those late night cravings.
If you can shuttle your way into downtown Los Angeles — walking is not recommended — then check out the following locations.
Syrup Desserts: Syrup is a great dessert restaurant where you can go to study or hangout with friends. I would highly recommend trying their delicious waffles with ice cream and fresh fruit. You can play board games with friends or study while having a cup of coffee and some sweets. Save room for plenty of treats because this place is open until midnight.
Wokano: This is an Asian fusion restaurant with an eclectic menu that also delivers. You can get high-quality sushi rolls and their famous crazy fried rice in the middle of the night because they are open, and deliver, until 2 a.m.
Perch: The French rooftop bistro allows for breathtaking views of L.A.. The ambiance is a cozy and rustic with an outside patio surrounded by lush vegetation. You can have a classy night out at Perch, overlooking the downtown L.A. skyline until 1 a.m. Sunday throughWednesday, and until 2 a.m. Thursday through Saturday.
24/7 Restaurant at The Standard: The Standard is a popular high-rise hotel in downtown Los Angeles with a hopping bar scene, but there is also a delicious restaurant at the hotel that is open 24 hours a day, seven days a week. Try their delicious comfort classics like a juicy burger that tastes like In-N-Out, and enjoy their spectacular view of the city.
Wurstküche: Wurstküche is a German restaurant located in the Arts District. The name translates to “Sausage Kitchen,” and the restaurant has a diverse variety of homemade bratwursts. Wait for your order and venture into the restaurant filled with communal seating that creates a sociable atmosphere. It is a great way to experience the German culture here in Los Angeles. They are open everyday from 11 a.m. until 1:30 a.m.
I hope these restaurants satisfy your midnight cravings, or make late study nights a little more fun. I would also suggest downloading the app called Grub Hub where a variety of restaurants deliver food to you.

In this episode of “USC Cribs,” one of our hosts, Tyreece Santana, helps us take a look inside the crib of Kymberly Lawyer and Kai Codner. From the living room, to the bedroom, we get to see it all. See Regal Trojan Apartments like you’ve never seen it before.
Kymberly Lawyer describes her style as simple and elegant. The senior fine arts student loves black and white, and hopes to pursue a career in interior design. For the first installment of USC Cribs, Lawyer and her roommate Kai Codner showed us around their Regal Trojan apartment.
For the living area, the duo selected a black and white color scheme with lime green accents. Like many college students on a budget, Lawyer and Codner search for economical yet stylish pieces. They snagged their luxe rug from the discount section at Costco.
One thing the fashionable roommates do not compromise on? Food. Host Tyreece Santana took a peek inside their refrigerator, stocked mostly with items from Trader Joe’s. Check out the video above for a complete look inside Lawyer and Codner’s awesome pad, and be sure to follow USC Cribs on Facebook.

After last weekend, it’s official: The regular season college football machine is firing on all cylinders as we chug on toward Week 3. Well, unless you’re Auburn or Notre Dame, who are probably thanking their lucky stars right now they limped through last weekend’s games. And oh no, now there are “just” seven Southeastern Conference teams in the Top 25 rankings — though Auburn did plummet 12 spots after barely holding off an Football Championship Subdivision team they were predicted to beat. Though it’s true the Pacific Coast Conference has had a somewhat quiet start to the regular season, thankfully our Trojans handily beat a team we paid $1.1 million to come play us, and we have been improving each week just in time for our first conference game against the Farm.
Now it’s that time again where I talk about that darn model thing. But after getting all excited about the stuff we added to the model last week, I promise to keep this section short and sweet. We expected our predictions for Week 2 to be somewhat shaky with the addition of new data. But rather than a complete bloodbath, we came out mostly unscathed with a 76 percent accuracy for the week. Sure, this drops our week over week average to 78 percent, but when you consider that many NFL pundits average approximately 61 percent accuracy when, you know, their livelihood focuses on knowing all about football, I’d say we are doing quite well.
See? Nice and short. Now let’s check out the predictions!

 
 
No. 15 Ole Miss at No. 2 Alabama (Spread: -19.5)
After a week out of the spotlight, ESPN’s College GameDay is back in Tuscaloosa as Alabama hosts Ole Miss this weekend. Readers will likely recall that Ole Miss was the only team to beat Alabama during the regular season last year. And while it is true that Ole Miss has averaged 74.5 points in their past two games, they’ve also only played an FCS team and a non-power five conference team. Despite their impressive final scores and other statistics, Ole Miss’ weak strength of schedule means that Alabama is a 19.5 favorite in our model. Nonetheless, this will be an interesting matchup, as a largely unproven Ole Miss team faces off against the ’Bama powerhouse.
No. 18 Auburn at No. 13 Louisiana State (Spread -14)
Remember when the Associated Press projected Auburn in the National Championship? Oh boy, it’s been a rough period for Auburn since their high preseason aspirations. It’s true, Auburn is still undefeated, but after squeaking by Jacksonville State last week, many are questioning whether Auburn is even capable of winning the SEC. And now the Tigers are traveling to “Death Valley” where they haven’t won since 1999.
As fun as it is to bag on Auburn for its early season issues, there is no question that this is not going to be a cakewalk for LSU. Last week, LSU very much looked liked a team just starting their season, especially with six Tigers making their first career starts and playing seven freshmen. Our model has LSU as a 14-point favorite, but they need to get rid of the sloppy penalties, especially against a more high-powered team like Auburn to pull out their first home win.
Stanford at No. 6 USC (Spread -20.5)
Ah, the infamous Stanford-USC game. While the spread seems to indicate that this should be yet another easy game for USC, Trojan fans should be wary of playing the Farm, regardless of what a college football writer’s model might say.
History aside, it’s important to point out the signs of improvement we’ve seen each game from USC. In particular, I want to give a shout out to our offensive line who, after giving up five sacks to Arkansas State, made sure Kessler had a much more enjoyable evening last weekend. They did not give up a single sack against the Vandals and enabled Kessler to throw for 410 passing yards.
This will be an interesting conference opener for both teams. For Stanford, this game is an opportunity to try and get their season back on track after a slow start. For USC, this game will be an opportunity to show that the first two games weren’t just flukes and that they deserve a spot in the top 10.
Side note:
While we’re on upset alert, another potential upset-alert matchup is No. 19 BYU at No. 10 UCLA. Though BYU rolled UCLA 59-0 back in 2008, the UCLA team today is quite a different beast. BYU has been able to keep their undefeated start going with both wins coming from last minute Hail Marys, and they have quite a few offensive options, but they will be going up against a fast, tough UCLA defense. This should be a good game to catch the tail-end of after the USC game.

Literatea is great for productive and picturesque study location. Alina Tang | Daily Trojan
Everyone knows about Lemonade, Seeds, Panda Express and California Pizza Kitchen in Campus Center. Located in the center of campus, these dining options are arguably the most popular places to grab lunch at USC. When 12:30 p.m. rolls around, you can almost guarantee that any of these places will have lines out the door. However, there are several other gems on campus that can certainly compete despite being more low-key and out of the way. Below are five underrated places that you should check out the next time you’re hungry:
1) Tutor Hall Café: I didn’t even know this café existed until my junior year, when my friend showed me a tasty Vietnamese sub he got from Tutor Hall. Tucked in the southeast side of campus, this spot is convenient (for engineering majors especially) because it’s rarely crowded and the service is fast. If you want to grab something quick between classes, you can score a delicious lemongrass chicken Banh Mi sandwich for around $5.
Address: 3710 S. McClintock Ave. (located in Viterbi)
2) Popovich Café: The best thing about Popovich Café is the generous portions. In my experience, you can get a very fresh and filling salad for a solid $8. Sure, you could probably make your own salad for way cheaper, but other places in L.A. will charge you up to $14. Last but not least, there’s also a Jamba Juice machine as well as a Peet’s Coffee and Tea brewery, for those who want an extra boost of energy in the middle of the day.
Address: 611 Exposition Blvd. (across from the Alumni House)
3) Literatea: This coffee shop is the coziest spot to study on campus. With all the gloominess and rain this past week, I was in Literatea curled up with a book and a cup of joe. My favorite drink there is the Chado tea, which is served in a pot with China teacups. Besides coffee and tea, Literatea also has a small food menu with a selection of snacks and pastries. Pro tip: Dip one of their scones in a delicious handcrafted mocha when you’re feeling especially indulgent. With the peaceful ambiance and a sweet treat in hand, you’ll be in heaven.         
Address: 3550 Trousdale Pkwy (behind Doheny Library)
4) Law School Café: To be honest, I only come here for the boba because being able to get a quick boba fix is crucial on a hot day. When I’m craving something cold and refreshing, I don’t want to venture all the way to Cup of Joy or Volcano on Figueroa just for pearl milk tea. The only place on campus that serves boba drinks, the Law School Café is enough to help me hit the spot. However, my friends who frequent this place,also claim that it has great chicken lettuce wraps.
Address: 699 Exposition Blvd. (located in basement of Gould School of Law)
5) West Annenberg Café: Annenberg can actually get pretty busy during lunch hours, but when it’s not crowded, I love studying and eating at the high table across from the cashier. So far, I’ve tried the Iced Cappuchino Tempesta and the Alfogato, and they have both been pretty tasty. If you want a break from Starbucks, I highly recommend these two drinks
Address: 3612-3624 Watt Way (located on the first floor of Annenberg Hall)

Two weeks ago, I took on The Chronic, West Coast rap’s most important export; this week, I’ll switch coasts and examine rapper Nas’s magnum opus: Illmatic.
In 1992, a Queensbridge native by the name of Nasir Jones began recording in New York his major label debut. He had recently been signed to Columbia Records, thanks in part to the recognition he received for his impressive feature on Main Source’s “Live at the Barbeque” (1991). The 19-year-old rookie had the good fortune of linking up with some of New York’s most respected producers, including DJ Premier, Pete Rock and Q-Tip. After roughly a year of recording, Illmatic was released in April 1994. 
Illmatic‘s initial commercial performance was mediocre — it debuted at No. 12 on the U.S. Billboard 200 chart and took two years to go gold. Critical praise for the album, however, started pouring in immediately. As rap’s golden era progressed and eventually came to a close, Illmatic emerged as one of the genre’s most important works. Today, it is almost universally heralded by music critics as the best rap album of all time.
That’s a pretty serious title for a record that clocks in at just under 40 minutes. And admittedly, the first time I listened to Illmatic, I was underwhelmed. It wasn’t immediately gratifying — or even immediately understandable. Nas’s employment of complex internal lines, his sheer love of words, and his relentless flow makes it impossible for a listener to fully grasp what he’s saying without listening closely. In other words, Illmatic is not background music.
So with each listen, I paid more attention. Each time, I discovered new metaphors, strings of multi-syllabic rhymes and instrumental nuances. That is part of what makes Illmatic such an impressive piece of work — it manages to marry depth with concision. In 40 minutes, Nas takes listeners through the streets of New York, reporting with almost journalistic precision scenes on the city’s streets.
There’s no better example of Nas’s lyrical prowess than “NY State of Mind,” the album’s second track. Nas intersperses vivid storytelling with classically descriptive language, effortlessly transitioning between the two. This unique stylistic choice allows Nas to give both a broad illustration and personal account of life in Queensbridge. DJ Premier’s beat is gritty and unadorned, a perfect reflection of the song’s subject matter.
Famously, you can hear Nas saying (in earnest), “I don’t really know how to start this man” to Primo before jumping in with unfettered bravado to one of rap’s most magnificent verses. It’s that kind of nuance that draws the line between a really good song and a legendary one.
But Illmatic is not considered the pinnacle of rap merely because its tracklist is nearly flawless; critically, Illmatic reminded rap of its roots. Whereas The Chronic created new archetypes in rap, Illmatic elegantly reinvigorated rap’s cultural foundations. At its core, Illmatic is an album that combines jazz and poetry. Yet, it is still undeniably contemporary, with beats that are timeless if not necessarily innovative. Likewise, its lyrics deliver common themes of hardcore hip-hop in a distinctly cerebral way.
And so, Illmatic is as culturally significant as it is musically significant. Everything from its sole feature (delivered by AZ) to its succinct hooks are impactful and purposeful. It is rap in its purest form, and reporting at its finest.

★★★★☆
To kick off my tour of donut places around Los Angeles, I took a trip down the classic Route 66 to Glendora to look for the man, the myth, the legend: The Donut Man.
What I found was a small house-like building off the side of the road that was sandwiched between other small businesses and left little room for parking or seating. At a glance, The Donut Man might seem like just a typical pink-box donut place — but it’s not. It’s a place of classic and new creations all in one, and the trek to the northeast edge of L.A. County is very much worthwhile.
On any typical day, the line of customers can wrap around the building, but luckily for me and my empty stomach, the line was not too long the morning I went. When I neared the front of the line and finally caught a glimpse of the donuts on display, I noticed many recognizable flavors, such as the classic sprinkles donut, so if you’re in the mood for an oldie but a goodie, you can definitely find it here.

If you’re looking to venture out and into a new realm of donut heaven, however, I would strongly encourage you to try the strawberry donut. The donut buns alone are nothing out of the ordinary, but when combined with glazed strawberries, they surpass any appreciation you might have had for strawberries or donuts individually. These were without a doubt my favorite donuts from this trip, and I’m secretly already looking for an excuse to go back for more.

The second donut I tried was the chocolate cake donut with coconut. For some reason, my first impression was that it was going to be a rather plain donut, but I was in the mood for something with chocolate so I ordered it anyway. After trying it, I was pleasantly surprised by the texture and the combination of chocolate with just the right amount of coconut — and by “right amount,” I mean a lot.

I’ll be the first to admit that The Donut Man is somewhat out of the way just to get a treat, but if for whatever reason your late-night antics lead you to Glendora, take solace in knowing that it is open 24 hours, and that you will walk away with your midnight munchies satisfied.
The only reason I gave The Donut Man four out of five stars is because of the location. Aside from being a little inaccessible to a college student without a car, there are also no seats or tables, so customers either take their orders home, or if you’re like me and can’t wait more than five minutes after setting your eyes on a donut, you can eat them in your car or on the sidewalk. All in all, though, this is an inconvenience I will willingly overlook for the sake of eating at The Donut Man again.
The Donut Man is located at 915 E Rte 66, Glendora, CA 91740.
