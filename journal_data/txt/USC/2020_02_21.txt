Notable Black figures from the USC community and symbols of Black excellence are the focus of a mural created by the Center for Black Cultural and Student Affairs, in partnership with LA Commons, University Communications and the Black History Month Legacy Project. The mural replica was unveiled Thursday at the Fisher Museum of Art and will be displayed in the CBCSA office.
The mural includes notable Black alumnus John Singleton, the first African American and youngest person to be nominated for an Academy Award for Best Director, and John and Vada Somerville, the namesakes of Somerville Place, the Black student cultural floor in Fluor Tower. 
The mural also depicts Durag Day, a national day of Black self-love and empowerment celebrated on college campuses and a 1970s Black student publication AllUsWe that depicts diverse stories. 
Keviette Minor, one of the artists and student mentors for the mural project, said a town hall was held at CBCSA to discuss what symbols students wished to incorporate in the mural. Those chosen included West African Adinkra symbols that students used to represent unity, radiance and patience. 
Students at the town hall also wished to commemorate Victor McElhaney, a USC student who was fatally shot last March. 
“[He was] a student who was very amazing and even though I didn’t get to meet him, I saw his impact in the CBCSA but also in the Black community, so we had to have him on the mural as well,” CBCSA director Greedley Harris said.
Lead artist Amani Holbert, an art teacher at the Boys & Girls Club, applied to work on the mural initially because her interests aligned with its purpose to celebrate Black history with the surrounding South Central community.  
“It really just encouraged me, seeing all the support from the students and that they really wanted to see something to represent them in the [CBCSA office] space,” Holbert said. 
Local high school students, invited through the project, worked with Holbert and Minor on the mural. 
Minor, a junior majoring in design, said students with an interest in art were encouraged to give back to the community through the project. 
“It’s just another way to engage them artistically, while also involving them in the USC community and just kind of bridging the gap between the surrounding community of South Central and the USC community,” Minor said. 
Harris said student engagement both within USC and the local community was important in the process of creating the mural. 
“We wanted to be very student-centered, and we wanted to make sure the students were as much [a part] of [the] process,” Harris said. “It was very much a community effort both internally and externally, which is really cool [for] engagement and really cool for the history and for what the space is.”
Holbert said she was able to relate to the students’ experiences and enjoyed uplifting the voices of those who are a part of marginalized groups on campus. 
“I had the chance to meet some of the students and it was really interesting to hear their perspectives on being Black students on campus,” Holbert said at the event. “Attending a predominantly white institution myself, I can relate to a lot of their experiences and their stories.”
Harris said that the mural was a way for Black Trojans to express themselves by documenting their history and celebrating Black History Month. 
“I think it’s a big step of us recording who we are, and showing who we are … and just showing what being a Black Trojan is,” Harris said. “I want to highlight that, recognize that, celebrate that it’s Black History Month. It was very important for us to unveil it during this time period.”
Minor said she had wanted a mural for CBCSA since freshman year when she saw the murals at La CASA. She said it motivated her decision to be a part of the project and help bring the mural to life. 
“It just means a lot to me that we’re finally being able to express ourselves in that way and see ourselves reflected in the space and on the walls,” Minor said.

Former South Bend, Ind. mayor and current Democratic presidential nomination candidate Pete Buttigieg spoke on the 2020 election, civic engagement and campaign funding at a town hall in Bovard Auditorium Thursday.
More than 1,000 people attended the Q&A-style event moderated by Fox 11 anchor and 2008 graduate Elex Michaelson and organized by the Center for the Political Future, Fox 11 and the USC Political Student Assembly. 	
In light of USC’s announement Thursday, Buttigieg commended new financial aid policy, which makes tuition free for all entering first-year undergraduates whose families make less than $80,000 a year and ends consideration of home equity in deciding all students’ financial need. He also shared his similar college affordability plan, which would grant free tuition to families making less than $100,000 through state-federal partnerships with public universities. 
“It’s great to see USC showing leadership in that regard,” Buttigieg said. “What we’ve got to do is have federal matching grants that are attractive enough that states will want to step up and do their part.”
Elsa Clever, a freshman majoring in business administration, said she believes Buttigieg’s education plan is promising.
“If he can make reforms like he said, with people making $100,000 or less — if he actually made that happen — I think that would be really big for a lot of people in America who can’t afford college or would be drowning in student debt,” Clever said.
Rachel Maltz, a senior majoring in business administration and communication data science, asked Buttigieg for his best advice for young people interested in politics, to which he said that students should find their own path to political involvement.
“The most important thing is to find something you care about,” Buttigieg said. “Plunge in and look for a way to make a difference … Don’t overlook the significance of the local [government] … It is often underestimated how much power and influence you can have at that level.”
Margaret Howes, a junior majoring in animation and digital arts, initially indicated she would ask a question about LGBTQ rights but instead asked Buttigieg why young voters should support him when he receives donations from individuals who oppose environmental reform. Buttigieg said he believed everyone should be able to contribute to his campaign regardless of their beliefs. 
“I don’t take corporate PAC money — just individuals’, and all of that is disclosed,” Buttigieg said. “I believe in transparency. I believe in changing the entire campaign finance system, but to do that, we have to win. And I also believe in defeating [President] Donald Trump.”
According to Howes, students whose questions were approved were answered by Buttigieg’s campaign manager before the town hall began and were similar to answers that Buttigieg later provided students.
“It kind of threw me off a little, it’s like this isn’t a town hall, you’re just reciting something that’s super rehearsed, and I mean, yeah LGBTQ issues, but I think that something much more important right now is climate change, especially for our generation,” she said.
Kambiz Akhavan, executive director of CPF, said attendees had the option to submit questions through Eventbrite as they registered for the event. Those questions were then shared with Fox11 who screened them ahead of the town hall to look for questions that weren’t redundant, ranged in topics and would challenge Buttigieg. Akhavan clarified that the questions were not shared with the Buttigieg campaign.
Stephanie Lund, a sophomore majoring in business administration and environmental studies, said the town hall changed her perception of Buttigieg and gave her a more personal understanding of him as a candidate.
“I think that he definitely has good policies, and he was more likeable in this setting than he has been for me via Twitter and other media,” Lund said. “I was kind of surprised by how much more I liked him … I definitely thought he was a bit more robotic previously but now he feels more genuine.”
Buttigieg said he will advocate for Americans he believes Trump has failed to represent. He has not been a target of racism, but he said he plans to prioritize the voices of those who have.
“I know that no one is suffering the pain of living under Donald Trump’s presidency more than voters of color, who have been singled out for discrimination with racial rhetoric and in so many ways are hurting because of this president, so I know that there is a laser focus on making sure that we can win,” Buttigieg said.
Michaelson asked Buttigieg why voters should consider him the ideal Democratic candidate to run against Trump in the upcoming presidential election. In response, Buttigieg said he will confront Trump for pretending to care about “forgotten” Americans from places like the industrial Midwest.
“As someone who actually lives in the industrial Midwest, who can speak to how divisive and how unsupportive his policies have been, I think I’m in a different position than anybody else in the race to do that,” Buttigieg said.
Buttigieg also discussed the intersection of poverty and racial inequality, saying the two issues are intertwined and carry financial and ethical significance.
“We need to recognize that the moral as well as economic as well as political future of this country depends on dealing with these patterns of inequality, which are also so closely connected with patterns of racial exclusion in our country,” Buttigieg said.
Buttigieg closed his speech with a call to action for 2020 voters, asking the public to unite around the common interest of defeating Trump.
“I think we could look back on 2020 with great pride, in how we came together to change the trajectory of this country,” Buttigieg said. “Time is running out. We have got to do it now, and that’s why I’m asking for your help.”
Gus Goetze, a senior majoring in business administration, said he attended the town hall to learn more about Buttitieg’s platform.
“To have a candidate come to campus and speak — especially when the pool is now so small as the Democratic side fights for this nomination — I want to be a part of that and take this conversation seriously and see if I can learn something and figure out who I want to cast my vote for,” Goetze said.
EDITOR’S NOTE: The article was updated to include comment from the Dornsife Center for Political Future regarding whether questions asked to Buttigieg were shared with the candidate’s campaign prior to the event.

Brad Keller has been named head coach of the USC women’s volleyball team, athletic director Mike Bohn announced Thursday.
The move comes after former USC head coach Brent Crouch unexpectedly resigned from his position Jan. 14 to take over the same role at Auburn University.
Keller served as an associate head coach of UCLA’s women’s volleyball team in 2019 and had spent the previous six seasons working as an assistant coach of the Bruins’ men’s team.
Keller was also an assistant coach of USC’s men’s team from 2007-10. 
“This is a dream for me,” Keller said in a press release Thursday. “I started at USC, so it’s so nice to be back here. This is a very exciting time, and I can’t wait to start working with this team to build on USC’s incredible women’s volleyball tradition.”
Keller helped lead the Bruins to a 19-12 record in 2019, advancing to the second round of the NCAA Tournament. The men’s program saw 10 All-Americans over the course of Keller’s tenure as assistant coach, and the Bruins earned a spot in the NCAA Tournament semifinal in 2016 as well as a 2018 runner-up finish. 
Keller’s staff consistently reeled in elite recruiting classes with the UCLA men’s program, helping land the No. 1 ranked class in 2013, 2014, 2017 and 2018, according to Volleyball Magazine’s rankings.
“We are very excited to welcome Brad back to the Trojan Family,” Bohn said in the press release. “His mastery of the Southern California recruiting landscape will be a difference-maker for our program. He brings a strong coaching pedigree and has coached the game at a national-caliber level.”
Between 2011-12, Keller held roles as an assistant coach for the UC Irvine men’s program, Connecticut women’s team and Santa Clara women’s program.
Included in his experienced resume, Keller was on the coaching staff of the U.S. Youth National Team from 2014-17 and took home second place at the NORCECA U19 Continental Championship in 2018.
Keller has seen success with the Trojans as well. In 2009, his men’s team won the Mountain Pacific Sports Federation Tournament en route to a second-place finish in the NCAA Tournament.
Now, Keller is back with USC, where he hopes to revitalize a program that went 40-25 in Crouch’s two seasons and got booted from the NCAA Tournament in the second round both years.
“He is a great fit for USC, and he embraces our aspirations to reclaim USC’s rich volleyball heritage,” Bohn said. “He has a deep passion for the game of volleyball and believes in our student-athlete centric model.”

The USC women’s basketball team is hitting the road for the last time in conference play to face Washington and Washington State this weekend. The Trojans beat both teams at Galen Center in January, with an 81-78 overtime win over the Huskies and a 74-63 victory over the Cougars.
Since January, Washington and Washington State haven’t enjoyed much success. Last week, both teams suffered winless trips to Arizona, dropping the Huskies to 3-5 on the road and extending Washington State’s losing streak to three games.
In addition, home court advantage hasn’t favored the Huskies much this year — Washington has lost four of its last five home games. As a result of this disappointing performance, Washington currently sits at 11th in the Pac-12 and looks desperate to dig itself out of the bottom of the conference. A win against USC could help do just that, considering the Huskies trail Colorado and WSU by only one game heading into this weekend. 
While USC hasn’t fared well on the road this season either, the team’s performance last weekend against top competition in No. 15 Oregon State and No. 3 Oregon proves the Trojans are making significant progress. 
Freshman forward Alissa Pili made USC history Monday by receiving Pac-12 Freshman of the Week honors for the third time this season, making her the first Trojan ever to receive this recognition three times. After a double-double performance against Oregon State and her 10th game scoring in double digits, Pili has established herself as one of the biggest threats in the Pac-12.
“She’s going to be a force for four years,” assistant head coach Jason Glover said. “And hopefully she’ll get selected as a Pac-12 Freshman of the Year, but she’s been huge. She’s our leading rebounder, leading scorer, second in minutes and now she’s a vital part of our organization.” 
Freshman guard Endyia Rogers, while lacking the consistency Pili brings, has the shooting ability to carry the Trojans well beyond the 50-point mark and log solid shooting performances from the field. USC will also look to freshman forward Angel Jackson to fill in for graduate guard Aliyah Jeune, who is out with a knee injury. 
The freshmen leading the Trojans’ effort will be matched against senior experience that both UW and WSU lean on. Husky senior guard Amber Melgoza currently averages a team-high 18.1 points per game while the Cougars’ redshirt senior forward Borislava Hristova leads the team with an average of 18.7 points per game. Both are constant scoring threats. 
After allowing Oregon to shoot 56.5% from the field at Galen Center, Pili emphasized the importance of shutting down shooters like Melgoza and Hristova.
“I think we need to tighten up on some little things [that] we’ve been struggling with defensively,” Pili said. “It was hurting us a lot — not getting out to shooters with urgency.”
The Trojans tip off in Seattle against Washington Friday at 7 p.m. and will face Washington State Sunday at Beasley Coliseum in Pullman, Wash. at 11:30 a.m.

There’s a lot happening in the world of sports right now, especially in Los Angeles. The NBA second half is about to kick off and the Lakers and Clippers are gunning for a top seed. Two USC basketball teams are playing key games down the stretch and making their cases for the NCAA Tournament. The MLB is a shitshow and the Dodgers are indirectly involved in that, for obvious trash-can- and 2017-World-Series-related reasons.
There’s also another important thing going on in the world, and it’s about to take L.A. and California by storm: the Democratic primary. (Wait, don’t lose me, I understand this is a sports column. I’ll get there.) 
What do these two things, sports and the primaries, have to do with each other? Honestly, pretty much nothing. But I do understand that the various going-ons of the sports world can be so time consuming that it’s hard to be fully informed about the various going-ons of the political world. For all you sports fiends out there faced with this predicament, fear not — here’s each relevant candidate described as a sports figure in a half-assed attempt to make things easier to understand. 
Sen. Bernie Sanders — LeBron James
You either love or you hate LeBron, and the same applies to Bernie. Seriously, have you ever heard someone express a neutral opinion about the Lakers superstar or the Vermont senator? Didn’t think so. Whichever side you stand on, you can’t deny they’re both remarkably consistent. LeBron has been an MVP candidate essentially every year for the past decade, and Sanders probably holds the record for fewest flip-flops of any politician, ever.
Both of them are quite experienced, they both have lost in the finals, and they’ll both earn their spot in the next “final” of their respective fields. Ooh! A dual prediction! 
Joe Biden — Clay Helton
Both of them were in prominent positions of quite successful teams just a few years ago, and at one point, some people thought they were both the guy. But recently, it’s becoming more and more obvious that their positive images were an illusion, created by someone else who actually was great and just took them along for the ride. Barack Obama, meet Sam Darnold. 
Both say a lot of things that make you go, what? Did he really just say that? They both often make you wonder if they really know what’s going on.
Both were once far more popular than they are today, and both are becoming even more unpopular by the minute. But, alas, they’re still quite relevant in their fields — for better, or, more likely, for worse.
Michael Bloomberg — New York Yankees
Rich. They think they can spend their way to the top, and honestly, they may not be wrong. Judging by the most recent national polls, Bloomberg has a shot to win this thing, and the Yankees certainly have a shot to take home the title in 2020 as well. Spending ridiculous sums of money on ads, spending ridiculous sums of money on Gerrit Cole. Money talks, I guess. 
What else does money do? It makes people hate you. If Bloomberg didn’t have the money, no one would be talking about his past racism or sexism because he wouldn’t be relevant. If the Yankees didn’t have the money, they’d be just another franchise — not the hated-by-everyone-except-Yankees-fans organization that they are. 
Sen. Amy Klobuchar — Kawhi Leonard
If I’m being honest, Klobuchar is about as entertaining of a speaker as Leonard. The monotone, often expressionless and rather mundane style serves as a constant reminder that Leonard isn’t here to have fun, just to play basketball — and, in Klobuchar’s case, run for president. 
Contrary to the Sanders/LeBron dichotomy in which a middle-ground stance is nonexistent and essentially forbidden, that dynamic doesn’t play out with Klobuchar or Leonard. In fact, most people I know lack an opinion about either. Neither is very hated (outside of the state of Texas), but neither is really worshipped (in the United States). Plus, did you see the way Klobuchar defended herself against Pete Buttigieg’s relentless attacks in Wednesday’s Democratic debate? That’s worthy of a Defensive Player of the Year Award — or two. 
Pete Buttigieg — LaMelo Ball 
Look, the promise is undeniably there. But come on, what has he actually done? Australian basketball? Mayor of South Bend? Lithuanian basketball? Please. 
I’m not knocking the basketball talent or the political smarts. But the hype is way too high. No. 1 pick in the NBA Draft? F-cking president? Y’all need to relax. 
Sen. Elizabeth Warren — Kevin Durant
Both Warren and Durant have been labeled by many angry followers of their respective fields as snakes, and, to be honest, it’s not a totally outlandish statement. 
Yes, Warren slightly backstabbed longtime pal Sanders for comments that she may have twisted and taken out of context; yes, Durant ditched his good friend Russell Westbrook and slightly snaked on the Thunder in 2016; yes, both of these moves were done with bigger goals in mind: Warren, the White House; Durant, a ring.
But once you move past that and realize that their snake-like tendencies are blown way out of proportion, what you’ll find is actually quite impressive. Durant is pretty damn good at basketball; Warren is smart, prepared and knows what she’s talking about. Don’t tell your friends you like either of them, though — it’s not “cool.” 
I acknowledge this exercise was totally worthless. When the primaries roll around, don’t rely on my stupid column, do your own damn research. But, if you take away one thing, let it be this: Joe Biden gives off insane Clay Helton vibes.

The USC men’s basketball team began its last regular season road trip Thursday with a 70-66 loss to No. 18 Colorado in Boulder, Colo. The loss prevented USC from avenging its 21-point Feb. 1 defeat to the Buffaloes, dropping the Trojans’ conference record to 8-6. 
Early in the game, the Trojans looked like they could limit the Buffaloes’ offense, forcing seven turnovers in the first 10 minutes and establishing a 14-point advantage. Colorado fell into a five minute scoring drought but was revived by junior guard Tyler Bey. Bey’s drives to the rim repeatedly drew fouls and chipped away at USC’s lead. 
Colorado shot 23% from the field through the game’s first 10 minutes. This improved to 34.5% by the half while USC’s offense began to lose its rhythm, leading to frantic shots and turnovers that reduced its 14-point lead to just 3 by halftime.
From the start of the second half, it was clear Colorado had made the necessary adjustments and was ready to perform on offense. In the first three minutes of the half, the Buffaloes scored 12 points without missing a shot, overcoming the first half deficit and establishing a lead USC would never take back. 
Much of Colorado’s comeback was predicated on exceptional ball movement. This left USC’s man-to-man defense scrambling and allowed for open looks both beyond the arc and in the paint against USC’s top defenders in freshman forward Onyeka Okongwu and senior forward Nick Rakocevic. Colorado finished the game with 16 assists in comparison to USC’s nine.
USC’s offense still dominated in the paint and shot over 50% in the second half, but this couldn’t make up for Colorado’s lethal 3-point shooting. The Buffaloes dwarfed the Trojans with 24 points from beyond the arc compared to just 6 from USC.
Okongwu’s offensive production kept USC hanging around. The star freshman was coming off of two missed games due to a concussion but didn’t stray much from his season scoring average by putting up 21 points. 
Unlike Okongwu, USC’s bench was not up to the challenge Thursday. The Trojans’ subs shot 2-of-17 from the field. The only bench player to come off the bench and score was sophomore guard Elijah Weaver, who chipped in with 4 points. 
“We’re happy to have [Okongwu] back,” head coach Andy Enfield said. “I thought he played a really good game tonight. Unfortunately, when it’s crunch time, we need all five guys to not make mental mistakes.”
The game came down to the last minute and 20 seconds when USC cut Colorado’s lead to 3. Unfortunately for the Trojans, they couldn’t produce off their next possession. Senior guard Daniel Utomi traveled while about to take a 3-pointer during the game’s final seconds, giving the Buffaloes the ball and the game. Colorado hit a free throw during its last possession and escaped with the 4-point win. 
The loss mirrored the last minute effort that came up short against No. 24 Arizona nearly two weeks ago during an 85-80 loss. For a team on the bubble of making the NCAA Tournament, Thursday’s loss dealt a critical blow to the Trojans’ hopes of making the Big Dance.
The Trojans travel to Salt Lake City to face the Utah Utes Sunday. Tip-off is at 3 p.m.

I was recently asked about my opinion on the presidential race as a “disinterested outsider,” to which I reminded my amicable inquisitor that, living here, I did hold some interest over the matter, regardless of my ability to cast a ballot. Not only this, but as a nation with an unmatched spotlight directed upon it, the ramifications of American politics reverberate across the world, informing movements that transcend well beyond the nation’s borders.
Furthermore, the United States is at the core of the post-Cold War neoliberal international order, so the attitudes and actions that U.S. leadership hold and partake in are of enormous consequence to the rest of the world. The inflection point of world affairs parallels the one the U.S. finds itself in internally as election year rumbles through — four years after a tide of anti-establishment leaders rode the populist wave into government palaces across the world in countries such as Brazil, Hungary and Great Britain.
This column’s political stance is built on ideals of global integration, pluralism, moderation and discourse, even as these ideals might seem decadent in the current political landscape. Nonetheless, I understand that all politics is reactionary.
Forgotten communities and left-behind national economic sectors across the world are the fallout of globalization’s failures and are one of the main instigators of the protectionist and nationalist movements that have defined the latter part of the past decade. 
The genius of one-time-long-shot-outsider Donald Trump is not the Machiavellian fealty he demands of his own party, or his sensationalist rhetoric appealing to all types of right and far-right ideologies, or the novelty of his brutal authenticity to character contrasted against a “swamp” of shifty politicians, or even every Trump-branded scandal (“All publicity is good publicity.”) 
The genius of the incumbent is him finding the pulse of the left-behind and forgotten and providing them a space to be heard and a direction toward which to point their aggression. While I do not approve of Trump’s divisive tactics, I understand the problems Trump has identified must be dealt with; ignoring the problem will not fix anything. 
This election is not about building a stronger coalition that can strong-arm Trump out of office; it’s about bringing people together and providing a better deal for all. With such an understanding, I am interested in forward-looking policies and campaigns seeking comprehensive solutions.
An ideal candidate should differ from Trump in a few fundamental ways. They should not exploit people’s troubles and anger for personal gain, but rather create solutions for them. They should seek to unite, rather than divide. They should have a win-win understanding of trade, rather than a zero-sum one; while Trump has managed to maintain a strong economy, it is unclear if its growth is sustainable because of the trade wars and fallouts left in its wake, not to mention the environmental degradation. 
The Democratic candidate should also have a prudent understanding of America’s place and role in championing freedom and human rights. Trump’s impulsivity has left allies reeling across the world and has eroded the power of institutions and organizations that find themselves at odds with his explosive rhetoric. As the U.S. becomes more unreliable, the international order becomes ever more uncertain of what its future might look like. Europe fragmenting as its influence wanes and China continuing to expand aggressively with little regard to human rights are only aggravating the situation. 
But has the Democratic Party provided us with a suitable candidate that can win? This remains unclear, as the party lacks the internal unity of Trump’s, weakened by a crowded candidate field, the Iowa debacle and the recent impeachment proceedings. 
Two wings dominate the candidate conversation: progressive and centrist. On the progressive wing, presidential hopeful Sen. Bernie Sanders seems to be gaining much traction, as Sen. Elizabeth Warren lags behind. However, both candidates’ visions are divisive and directed at their bases exuding a similar in-group prioritization as Trump. 
Meanwhile, the centrist field is clogged by an unnecessary number of candidates, most of whom do not seem particularly promising. Sen. Amy Klobuchar seemed to be going nowhere until New Hampshire, and with a campaign lacking in national resources, it is unclear if she will go anywhere else. Former Vice President Joe Biden’s campaign is reduced to the hope of a decent showing in South Carolina keeping it alive. Michael Bloomberg’s late entry and unorthodox approach makes his campaign seem little more than an attempt to buy his way to the nomination. 
The exception might be former Mayor Pete Buttigieg, with one of the most appealing candidate profiles we’ve seen in a long time: Midwestern, Harvard-educated, military veteran, gay, an outsider and virtually unknown a year ago, the only non-millionaire running for office. He has an eloquence and composure fit for the White House and a charisma, energy and momentum that other campaigns seem to lack. However, his young age and troubles catering to marginalized populations might yet derail his campaign. 
Overall, the disunity in the Democratic Party only serves to weaken it, especially at a time when not only the country but the entire world could benefit from more unity. The alarmism of some might be unnecessary, however; whatever the election results, the world is bigger than the U.S., and the U.S. is bigger than an election. Nonetheless, across the world are real people facing real issues, who deserve peace and prosperity and leaders who will lead with the people’s interests in mind rather than their own.

It is a common trope in the era of big tech and STEM that a humanities degree is essentially worthless. What can a graduate do with a degree in history, sociology or medieval Spanish literature? In our fast-paced world and  with the on-demand culture that permeates millennial lives, it is easy to understand why a high-paying job right out of college is attractive. Yet, liberal arts degrees transcend monetary value and teach students to think analytically of past and present issues instead of relying on instant gratification. 
The decline in popularity of liberal arts degrees is multi-layered. At the nuclear family level, it is common for parents to believe STEM is synonymous with success, resulting in parents pressuring their child to undertake a degree in that field. The making of the humanities into a punchline has been paralleled at the government level by leaders such as former President Barack Obama. On the world stage, the Chinese government has unveiled plans to turn 42 universities into schools of science and technology. Similarly, the United Kingdom’s focus on STEM has led to a 20% drop in students taking advanced classes in English literature and a further decline of 15% in the number of students studying the arts. 
While most students are drawn to a career in STEM because of promises of a big paycheck, STEM degrees do not always guarantee a higher salary, particularly for women. The job website Glassdoor reported an 18% pay gap within mathematics with men earning a median base salary of $60,000 in the first few years after college, as opposed to $49,182 for women. This is not meant to purport the fantasy that a liberal arts degree pays more or more equally but rather that a STEM degree has its drawbacks. 
In today’s fast-paced world, interest, innovation and inspiration are not traits that need to be tamed. Indeed, without these traits, a monotonous hum of low-level digital connectivity is created. As a result, society is on a course to tangle itself into the abyss and blind spots of big data. As we lose ourselves in the digital age, more human judgment is essential to sort out the problems that technology cannot compute alone. 
Companies are becoming increasingly concerned with the communication and analytical skills of their employees — two skills that are taught through a humanist education. A study found that the rapidly expanding opportunities in the United States require more than just the STEM-based skills they acquire. 
Two Microsoft executives further elaborated on the need for liberal arts degrees: “As computers behave more like humans, the social sciences and humanities will become even more important. Languages, art, history, economics, ethics, philosophy, psychology and human development courses can teach critical, philosophical and ethics-based skills that will be instrumental in the development and management of AI solutions.” 
Having a liberal arts degree truly does open the mind to possibilities of learning. The humanities expose individuals to what it truly means to be human by studying great subjects and figures. Painters such as Ernie Barnes, Diego Rivera and Claude Monet demonstrate the breadth of creativity and beauty within the human spirit. Philosophers and writers such as Saint Augustine, Thomas Aquinas and Immanuel Kant provide questions no one had ever thought of asking. 
The humanities play a crucial role in allowing and training our minds to think and learn the complex story of our human existence. 
Christopher Aranda contributed to this opinion.

As if this column wasn’t taboo enough — let’s talk about sex.
As weed continues to be steadily commodified, it becomes harder and harder (yes, the word choice was absolutely deliberate) to think of a product that doesn’t exist in cannabis-infused form. Weed’s mass commercialization has yielded wondrous products like THC- and CBD-based lubricants and sexual enhancement pills, among other tinctures, edibles and flowers specifically advertised to make sex more pleasurable.
This isn’t a new concept — from second century India, to Medieval Europe, cannabis has had a long history of being used to enhance intimacy, develop relationships and magnify human sexuality. Centuries later, though, modern science is still trying to answer a basic question: Is cannabis an aphrodisiac?
Under its current federal classification as a Schedule I drug, cannabis is notoriously difficult to study. Add the complexities of sexual interaction — what constitutes good sex and how it can be quantified — and the conclusions academics have reached are frustratingly inconclusive. 
Most studies not only employ self-reported, survey-based methods, that are hard to verify, but they also tend to focus exclusively on white, heterosexual male experiences, include small sample sizes and rely on the subjective interpretation of concepts such as sexual arousal and enjoyment. These studies also have no way of corroborating subjects’ cannabis consumption, dosage or the chemical composition of the particular strain — THC-dominant, CBD-dominant or hybrid. 
It’s also possible that the people who have had better experiences mixing cannabis with sex are the most eager to participate in these studies, leading to bias. There’s also the placebo effect, where people expect weed to enhance sex, precluding a bad sexual encounter while under the influence. 
Oh, one more thing: Sexual activity and functioning are incredibly difficult to study, given their subjectivity, immeasurability and nuance. Biological, sociocultural, personal, psychological and many other factors drive arousal, attraction and orgasms. Sexual pleasure is also easily impacted by a person’s libido level and mood at a particular period in time.
What I’m saying is we don’t know much about anything, but some linkages have been made among increased sexual frequency, pleasure, arousal and cannabis. 
And theoretically, it makes sense that weed, based on its properties, positively impacts sex. The body’s endocannabinoid system, which is crucial in regulating pleasure, pain, relaxation and homeostasis and plays a significant role in sexual function, is activated through cannabinoids found in cannabis. This means that consuming cannabis produces feelings of relaxation, pleasure and decreased pain. Weed is a vasodilator that promotes increased blood flow and opens capillaries, enhancing sensitivity, which could then lead to better sex and orgasms. Cannabis is also known for its anxiety-reducing effects, which could lower inhibitions and feelings of pressure when it comes to sexual activity.
However, cannabis is also a biphasic compound, meaning that low versus high doses of the substance can result in opposing effects. So even though cannabis can lessen anxiety, high doses can harm cannabis’ supposed aphrodisiac qualities.
Research also seems to indicate that cannabis affects men and women in different ways, especially when sex is a factor. According to sex therapist Lawrence Siegel, THC targets a part of the brain associated with libido and sexual arousal in women. CBD, a non-psychoactive cannabis compound, is associated with relaxation and decreased pain, meaning it could be helpful for women who have endometriosis or who experience pain during sex.
For men, cannabis use has been associated with erectile dysfunction, lower sperm count and trouble orgasming or orgasming too quickly — potentially due to weed’s testosterone-lowering effects, a hormone linked to both men and women’s sex drives. Contrastingly, another study found that moderate cannabis use can contribute to higher sperm count and other reproductive benefits, possibly indicating that only high doses of cannabis lead to negative effects.
Interestingly, a 2017 study in the Journal of Sexual Medicine found a correlation between sexual frequency and cannabis use, where daily users across all demographics reported having 20% more sex than those who had never consumed cannabis. The study also concluded that weed doesn’t seem to impair sexual function.
OK, that’s all great, but can you even consent to sex if you’re high? The answer isn’t so black and white. 
As legalization blows through the nation, lawmakers and scientists struggle to form comprehensive policies regulating cannabis consumption with certain basic activities, like driving. Legislation regarding consent and cannabis isn’t even on the radar, not to mention some states’ definitions of consent are still ridiculously outdated and inadequate.
It would be much easier to conclude that any mind-altering substance shouldn’t be mixed with something as intimate as sex. But the reality is that legislation and modern culture have concluded that sex and drugs are much more complex: People can and often do consent to sex while under the influence.
It goes without saying, cannabis affects decision-making and sexual behavior in widely disparate ways from alcohol. While there are direct links between alcohol and unsafe sexual behavior and aggression, there is no such evidence directly connecting cannabis with rape and sexual assault.
Ultimately, sex is complex enough as it is without adding cannabis to the equation. The minimal and flawed studies conducted regarding the subject are inconclusive, and there’s no concrete evidence cannabis improves sex or treats sexual dysfunctions.
Regardless, if you choose to experiment with cannabis during sexual activity, it’s important to establish boundaries, start with low doses, go slow and emphasize affirmative consent. It could also be helpful to first experiment with yourself before doing so with a partner. 
Sex should be enjoyable and safe, and thorough research, specifically larger quantifiable studies with more diverse populations, on cannabis’ effects and human sexuality is desperately needed. Meanwhile, make sure to consult a sex therapist or doctor about any sexual health problems or concerns.
