Despite recent student complaints about increased enforcement of bicycle rules by the Dept. of Public Safety and Los Angeles Police Department, DPS said the enforcement was intended to educate students about bike rules on campus and LAPD said enforcement was not targeted at students.
Parking spot · Bikes that are not locked to a rack can be impounded by the Dept. of Public Safety and recovered for a $20 fee, according to SCampus guidelines. - Katelynn Whitaker | Daily Trojan
DPS Capt. David Carlisle said bikes have been impounded without attached fines because informing students of bicycle-related rules was the primary intention. SCampus says students can receive a $20 fine for each impoundment.
“We are trying to educate students about appropriate bike protocols, not punish,” Carlisle said in an email. “Bicyclists need to be considerate of others.”
Students have also expressed concern over intermittent enforcement of bike violations by LAPD.
According to LAPD Sgt. C. Mayberry, increases in LAPD presence is directly related to officer availability.
“We can only do what we have resources for at the time, and we cannot sit [on the streets] for 24 hours a day, seven days a week,” Mayberry said. “If we’re out handling radio calls, we might not be on the street enforcing basic traffic violations.”
DPS had a station on campus Thursday for students to claim bikes that were confiscated because of violations of USC’s bicycle policy, including being illegally parked. Carlisle said approximately 320 bicycles were impounded.
Though students were not fined this time, Carlisle said students who deliberately disregard campus bicycle policy from now on will be fined.
“Sometimes fines are appropriate for students who intentionally ignore the rules such as when they block handicapped ramps,” Carlisle said. “During the last [Disability Task Force] meeting there were complaints of bikes blocking the handicapped ramp at Leavey, which is a chronic problem.”
SCampus says students who block building access, wheelchair ramps or handicapped ramps receive a $35 impound fee and those who lock their bikes to a ramp receive a $75 fee.
Rachel Bensimon, a freshman majoring in communication who had her bike confiscated by DPS, said the university could easily reduce the number of bikes that are in violation of USC bicycle policy by increasing the number of bike racks around campus.
“I had my bicycle confiscated by [DPS] after I parked it outside of EVK because all the spots on the bike rack near EVK were full,” Bensimon said. “If [the university] wants to see fewer bike violations in the future, [it] should build more bike racks, because [it] will help prevent bikes from being parked in places that obstruct key areas on campus.”
Other students said a strict enforcement of bicycle policy is critical for bicycle security, particularly in regards to the locking and parking student bikes.
“It’s great that DPS is taking the initiative [to impound bikes], so we know that they care about bicycle security,” said Kathryn Kinas, a freshman majoring in business. “Bicycle [theft] is a major crime on campus, so DPS should show students that they are addressing the issue seriously.”
Some students also said there are more important things LAPD can focus its limited resources on.
“I received a $300 ticket for not walking my bike 20 feet across an intersection, and there are people who speed [in their cars] and are ignored,” said Daniella Acuna, a senior majoring in international relations. “If DPS and LAPD want to make a big difference on and off campus, they should focus on reducing crime, since I’ve had four bikes stolen since I’ve been at USC.”
The California Department of Motor Vehicles considers bicyclists moving vehicles, so it is illegal to not stop for pedestrians, ride on the wrong side of the road, ride on the sidewalk without prioritizing the safety of others, wear headphones while riding or talk on a cell phone when riding.
The Undergraduate Student Government hosted a forum about bicycle usage on campus last year and intends to address the issue with its newest task force, “We are considerate, we are USC.” The task force will discuss the issue during its first meeting later this month.
 
Correction: A previous version of this article stated that it was illegal to ride bicycles on sidewalk. Under LAMC 56.15, it is only illegal to ride a bicycle on the sidewalk with a “willful or wanton disregard for the safety of persons or property,” according to bicyclela.org.
Here another note. If LAPD and/or DPS feels the bicycling on the sidewalk is a hazard in certain places 
Another little  unknown law is in effect. LAMC 85.07, which is unlisted on the city’s “Bicycle and the Law” page, regulates rollerskating, skateboarding and bicycling:
    SEC. 85.07. REGULATION OF ROLLER-SKATING, SKATEBOARDING AND BICYCLING. (Added by Ord. No. 166,526, Eff. 1/27/91.) (a) The Department of Transportation is hereby authorized to install any traffic control devices it determines necessary to regulate roller-skating, skateboarding and bicycling on sidewalks and roadways in order to improve vehicular or pedestrian movement, reduce congestion or diminish accident potential. Such determinations shall be made only on the basis of traffic engineering principles and traffic investigations. When such determinations have been made, the Department is authorized to install signs giving notice as to the nature of the regulation as well as signs that provide such safety warnings as it determines will assist those engaged in the regulated activities.
    (b) No person shall roller-skate, skateboard, or operate a bicycle in violation of the limitations set forth on regulatory signs posted pursuant to this section.
SEC. 56.15.  BICYCLE RIDING – SIDEWALKS.
     (Amended by Ord. No. 148,990, Eff. 12/17/76.)
     1.     No person shall ride, operate or use a bicycle, unicycle, skateboard, cart, wagon, wheelchair, rollerskates, or any other device moved exclusively by human power, on a sidewalk, bikeway or boardwalk in a willful or wanton disregard for the safety of persons or property.  (Amended by Ord. No. 166,189, Eff. 10/7/90.)
As a motorist, bike rider, and pedestrian, I’m in favor of everyone leaning the “rules of the road”. However, there is much misinformation circulation around town, including among law enforcement personnel and journals. 
Your article states, incorrectly that 
“The California Department of Motor Vehicles considers bicyclists moving vehicles, so it is illegal to not stop for pedestrians, ride on the wrong side of the road, ride on the sidewalk….”
L.A.M>C  ordinances  for bicycle have several important exceptions, including riding on sidewalk. Which is permitted with care in Los Angeles under 
 ( LAMC 56.15) Prohibits the riding of bicycles (or other human power devices) on sidewalks (bikeways or boardwalks) with a willful or wanton disregard for the safety of persons or property
May I suggest the following website for accurate information
http://www.bicyclela.org/Law.htm
You should print a correction in your paper.and inform the USG forum. 
The article also did not state where and when the meeting would be held.
Could not correct posing
In case I did not make it clear 56.15 does allow the riding of bicycle on the sidewalk with care!
I received a ticket for not having a night light on my bicycle when I was riding it just before sunset.  WTF LAPD.  Bicycle manufacturers should be required to equip their bikes with lights, not consumers.  This is equivalent to Ford selling cars without headlights and then seeing the government punish drivers instead of the vehicle manufacturer.  The LAPD is a joke around USC.  Why don’t they do some real good and prevent students from getting mugged or worse.
The penultimate paragraph of this article is wrong. The DMV does not prohibit riding bicycles on sidewalks or in crosswalks; those are county or municipal decisions. Neither LA city nor county have laws in this regard, except to disallow sidewalk riding “with a willful or wanton disregard for the safety of persons or property.”
See http://www.bicyclela.org/Law.htm
It is ridiculous how many bikes there are on campus. it takes 10 minutes to walk from one side to the other. Additionally, the people on bikes don’t care about anyone else around them, which is why DPS is impounding bicycles. Try walking across campus without almost being hit. I’d say the overwhelming majority of students never rode a bike as legitimate transportation before they came here, hence why they are all clueless.

To comply with a federal mandate effective Oct. 29, USC posted a calculator through the admissions website that allows applicants to estimate the amount of need-based aid they will receive.
The calculator provides an estimate of the net price of the university for a student based on their family income, aid eligibility and other factors.
The Higher Education Opportunity Act, mandated the change this year, requires universities to “develop a net price calculator to help current and prospective students, families and other consumers estimate the individual net price of an institution of higher education for a student.”
Though the university’s official total estimated cost of attendance is about $58,000 per year, including tuition, room and board and other expenses, the calculator will show what the expected cost to individual students will be.
USC’s calculator asks 19 questions similar to those found on the Free Application for Federal Student Aid, which applicants fill out to receive federal financial aid. The survey estimates how much state, federal and university need-based aid a student can expect to receive based on the amounts awarded to students with similar financial circumstances in the previous year.
“Like anything else, it’s an approximation,” said Thomas McWhorter, dean of the Financial Aid Office. “From the amount of time we’ve spent on the calculator, I know that it gives pretty good results. But when you use computer algorithms to simulate this, it won’t be perfect.”
The site clearly notes the estimates do not represent a final determination and are not binding.
“The students will get an idea and understanding of the cost of higher education, but also the possibilities and options they have,” McWhorter said.
Some students said they were excited about the new college admissions tool.
“It’s very helpful, especially when it comes to private schools, which tend to be more expensive,” said Aziz Akbari, a freshman majoring in mechanical engineering. “Because money is usually a factor, this information will help students make a better decision.”
Some students said they would have liked this resource during their application process.
“I didn’t know how much aid money I’d get until I submitted my deposit. [The calculator] would have been very useful to me in making my decision,” said Brett Dutton, an undeclared freshman.
Ifrah Sheikh, a sophomore majoring in fine arts, said the calculator will be more useful than the estimated total cost, which was the only cost previously available online.
“[Prospective students] just look at the overall price because that’s what’s available,” Sheikh said. “[With the calculator] they’ll be better able to see if [USC] is worth it or not based on the cost of education.”
The estimate does not, however, include student loans, work study or merit aid.
Of entering students, 23 percent receives merit awards, according to the Financial Aid Office, including full scholarships, half scholarships and other awards, which are not based on financial need or family income.
“The merit scholarships are a big factor in many students’ decisions. If the site doesn’t tell students about [merit scholarships], then it isn’t really an accurate estimate,” said Kim Chu, a sophomore majoring in computer science and business administration.
The Financial Aid Office does not predict merit awards because they are awarded to students by admissions.
The federal law gives universities the option of either using a template developed by the federal government or developing the calculator on their own. USC developed its own calculator, according to the Financial Aid Office.
A major concern for the university was trying not to confuse prospective students or their parents, according to the Financial Aid Office.
The office also did not want to discourage any prospective students from applying for financial reasons.
“We don’t want students to look at the freshman profile and think ‘I’m not going to be admitted.’ We still want them to apply,” McWhorter said. “It’s the same thing with the calculator. We don’t want someone to look at this and not apply.”
According to College Board, the average full-time student in the United States receives more than $6,000 in grants. At USC, 63 percent of students receive need or merit-based aid.
Sartaaj Walia, a sophomore majoring in history and neuroscience, was apprehensive about the utility of the calculator and said personal expenses are difficult to predict.
“I don’t know how useful this calculator will be,” Walia said. “It’s really hard to predict how much a university education will actually cost.”
Others said the calculator would not have been very useful because it only considers need-based aid.
“They made it clear that my family wouldn’t get any aid, so [the calculator] would not have been very relevant to me,” said Caroline Prado, a sophomore majoring in business administration.

A hearing concerning the conduct of the USC University Hospital in relation to its caregivers will take place today.
The National Union of Healthcare Workers filed labor charges of unfair conduct, which led the National Relations Labor Board — a branch of the federal government — to issue complaints against the hospital.
“The USC University Hospital has failed to negotiate in good faith,” said John Borsos, vice president of the NUHW. “One responsibility a union has is to file a complaint with the university when something like this happens.”
University Hospital administration is not commenting on the matter at this time, according to Health Sciences Director of Media Relations Leslie Ridgeway.
Borsos said there have been four or five allegations over the last two months. He said the hospital has made changes normally subject to negotiation, such as workers’ schedules, work assignments and repercussions for arriving late to work, and unlawfully suspended a relatively new employee for discussing a union.
NUHW is requesting the University Hospital revert these changes.
“Essentially, they will have to undo what they have done; if employees have been wronged, they must be made whole,” Borsos said. “They must let employees know that they had acted in bad faith and they will have to compensate people for anything they have lost.”
The court hearing will be a trial brought before an administrative law judge. There will be no jury. After the federal government, NUHW and USC University Hospital attorneys make their respective arguments, the administrative law judge will submit a written decision.
Despite the drawn-out process, Borsos said he expects the union to be successful in the trial.
“When the National Relations Labor Board issues a complaint and that complaint goes to hearing, the number of times the federal government wins is incredibly high,” Borsos said. “It would be quite unusual for us to not prevail.”
He said that the case has gone to trial is a favorable sign for the union because it often takes months of deliberation to decide a complaint requires a hearing. He said the university could have saved time and money by working out the issues with the union and the caregivers instead of going to court.
“One of the reasons the caregivers took the step to strike is because of the continued bad faith bargaining of the university,” Borsos said. “Even the federal government stepped in. We think it’s time for USC Hospital to stop wasting money and to allow their caregivers — the people patients depend on at the hospital — to have a more meaningful work relationship.”
 
Correction: A previous version of this article said Keck School of Medicine administration is not commenting on the matter at this time. Keck is not involved in the matter. The issue is with USC University Hospital, which is owned by USC.

The USC men’s and women’s swim and dive teams opened up the 2011 season with impressive victories.
The Women of Troy defeated Washington State 120-74 in Pullman, Wash., and the Trojans defeated CSU Bakersfield 150-101 at McDonald’s Swim Stadium.
Led by junior Christel Simms and sophomore Stina Gardell, the women’s team featured winners in eight separate events. Simms won the 100-yard freestyle and was a member of the winning 200-yard medley relay team.
Gardell took first in the 200-yard freestyle and the 200-yard backstroke.
Haley Anderson contributed to the USC victory, winning the 1,000-yard freestyle and the 500-yard freestyle.Meghan Hawthorne and Katka Hosszu who won the 200-yard IM and the 200-yard butterfly, respectively.
On the men’s side, the Trojans were winners in 11 events. With sophomore Vladimir Morozov leading the way with victories in the 100-yard breaststroke and 100-yard freestyle, USC did not have much trouble dealing with visiting CSU Bakersfield.
“It felt good,” Morizov said of the team’s effort. “We’re putting in a lot of work in the weight room and the pool, and it’s just the beginning of the season, but we’ve already been putting up fast times. It’s a good start to our season.”
Other winners for the Trojans included Julian Bonse in the 1,000-yard freestyle, Dimitri Colupaev in the 200-yard freestyle, Nick Karpov in the 100-yard backstroke and Chad Bobrosky in the 500-yard freestyle. The 400-yard medley team also took first place.
“It went really well,” assistant coach Jeremy Kipp said of the victory. “There’s been a lot of early season meets around the country from the SEC and some other Pac-12 schools and we wanted to put up times that were going to be comparable to the duel meets. I think we did that.”
Kipp also noted some specifics the Trojans excelled at.
“The freshmen looked pretty good,” he said. “They’ve seen the upperclassmen really compete and they have a better idea of what’s coming up in the next month or two months. All in all, there’s very few holes in the lineup.”
Both teams have a few weeks off until they get back in the pool for competitive action. The next swim meet for USC will not be until Nov. 4 when it hosts the USC Diving Invite. Teams expected to compete include conference foes from Arizona, Stanford and California.

If these last two games are any indication, reigning Mountain Pacific Sports Federation Player of the Week sophomore two-meter Jeremy Davie might be hitting his stride as he recorded his second consecutive hat-trick, as No. 2 USC (13-2, 4-0) topped No. 5 Santa Barbara 10-6.
On the attack · Senior driver Peter Kurzeka notched two goals against UC Santa Barbara on Sunday to help lead USC to victory. Kevin Nguyen | Daily Trojan
“[Davie] had a rough time in Junior Worlds, as his coach really didn’t play him as much as he should’ve played him,” USC coach Jovan Vavic said. “I think he was a little frustrated with that, and then kind of got out of shape just because he wasn’t playing that much. He needed some time with us just to get his confidence back. He’s certainly an outstanding player.”
In addition to Davie’s exploits, the victory can be attributed to the Trojans’ focus on improving man-down defense and man-up offense. USC won handily because it squashed the Gauchos’ power play chances and capitalized on its own odd-man advantage opportunities.
“We’ve spent a lot of time these past couple of weeks improving our six-on-five and five-on-six play, and it really clicked today,” Vavic said. “That was the best part of our game; we were six out of eight on those opportunities. Our man-down defense was excellent. We gave up three goals out of 11 chances.”
Upon recounting who played well, Vavic praised a number of players. The first he mentioned, senior driver Peter Kurzeka, notched two goals to add to his team total of 26 for the season. The second player he singled out, redshirt junior driver Forest Monroe, is usually tabbed for his defensive excellence, but Monroe also contributed offensively on the afternoon with two crucial goals.
“Kurzeka had a great game, and Monroe, who usually doesn’t score too much for us, scored two big goals on great outside shots,” Vavic said. “Those were really a big boost for our team.”
Rounding out the standout players in the game were sophomore driver Nikola Vavic, who, in addition to notching a goal, registered two assists and junior two-meter Brian Boswell, who not only drew three ejections that later turned into goals but chipped in a score of his own.
“We played with quite a bit of intensity,” Vavic said. “I thought our defense was pretty good most of the game, and we played tough. We played a smart, physical game.”
On Saturday at the McDonald’s Swim Stadium at 2:30 p.m., the Trojans have a chance to exact revenge against Stanford for a loss in the SoCal tournament semifinals.

It was the kind of weekend the USC women’s soccer team had been searching for all season.
For the first time in nearly two months, the team swept a weekend series. The Women of Troy have now won three straight games for the first time in nearly two months. And for the first time this season, they won a home game — make that two home games.
The Women of Troy (6-11, 3-5) got their first home win of the season Friday with a dramatic 2-1 overtime victory over Arizona State, and they followed that up Sunday with a 1-0 domination of Arizona on senior day.
Despite the one goal, it was one of the Women of Troy’s most complete performances of the season.
“It was a great way to end our home season,” USC coach Ali Khosroshahin said. “To send the seniors out on a positive note at home. That’s one of the games you remember the most after you’re done playing, that final game at home. I was happy that we took care of them today.”
And it was a senior who set up that lone goal.
Just before the hour mark, senior forward Claire Schloemer played a through ball to  sophomore midfielder Elizabeth Eddy, streaking down the right side.
She took the ball all the way to within five yards of the goal before finishing past a hopeless Wildcat goalie for her team-high fourth goal of the year.
“Obviously we wanted to win because we love winning,” Eddy said. “But even more so for our seniors.”
Though just one shot found the back of the net, USC came close countless times, racking up a season-high 18 shots — eight on goal.
In the 48th minute, Eddy broke free down the right side in a similar run to the goal she scored later.
Unlike later in the game, her near post attempt was stopped cold by the Wildcat goalie.
Five minutes later, USC came close again as senior midfielder Ashli Sandoval’s lunging deflection was cleared off the line by an Arizona defender.
Moments later, senior midfielder Carly Butcher rifled a shot that went just over the crossbar, causing Khosroshahin to scream in anguish from the bench.
In the 68th minute, Eddy drew a foul just outside of the penalty box. Sandoval took the free kick for the Women of Troy and smacked a shot that made it past the Wildcat wall and goalie but not past the far goalpost.
“I really wanted to score today,” said Sandoval, who had 10 of USC’s 18 shots and put five on goal. “To do it my last game here … just unlucky I guess.”
While Sunday might have been the Women of Troy’s most complete win of the season, Friday was easily their most thrilling.
Sandoval scored from a header off of a corner kick in the 83rd minute — the first goal of the season for the fifth-year senior. The Women of Troy looked to be on the verge of their first home win of the season.
But with just 40 seconds remaining, they conceded a devastating equalizer. It looked like USC was going to lose yet another heartbreaker at home.
Exactly four minutes into overtime, Claire Schloemer changed that.
The senior forward smacked a shot from the top of the penalty box that ripped the nylon in the back of the net before anyone could even move.
The golden goal was the first career-game winner for Schloemer and her first of the season. Most importantly, it gave the Women of Troy their first win of the season at McAlister Field.
With the weekend sweep USC has a chance to do something that Sandoval said she would not have thought possible two weeks ago: finish the seaon with a winning record in conference.
They travel to Utah and Colorado next weekend before finishing up their season on Nov. 4 at UCLA.

The winning streak is now at 12 and counting.
The No. 3 USC women’s volleyball team strengthened its lead in the Pac-12 with sweeps against Colorado and Utah over the weekend, tying a similar streak to open the 2010 season.
“We expected a good effort from Utah and Colorado and we came out really strong,” USC coach Mick Haley said. “We like that teams are gunning for us and we want the girls to get excited about that.”
Dishing it · Senior setter Kendall Bateman finished with a team-high 29 assists, as the Women of Troy recorded a three-set victory at Galen Center over Colorado. It marked their 12th straight Pac-12 victory. - Luciano Nunez | Daily Trojan
The Women of Troy (17-3, 12-1) disposed of Colorado 25-18, 25-14, 25-17. And senior outside hitter Alex Jupiter led USC throughout the match with nine kills, 12 digs, two aces and two solo blocks.
“Jupiter is a silent leader and not a big talker, but her leadership shows in how hard she is working on her defense and passing,” Haley said. “Her blocking and attacking have always been very good, but now her backcourt defense has been good, as she focuses on improving the little parts of her game.”
With her performance, Jupiter moved into third place all-time in kills for USC, passing Tracy Clark in the process. She is also tied for fifth on USC’s career solo blocks list.
Sophomore middle blocker Alexis Olgard took advantage of more playing time, notching five kills and no errors against the Buffaloes.
Junior middle blocker Natasa Siljkovic also tied a personal best with four kills.
Kerra Schroeder led Colorado with a game-high 10 kills to go along with three aces and three blocks.
Against Utah (8-13, 3-9), USC wasted no time asserting itself in the match after scoring the first eight points of the match en route to a 25-15 victory in the first set.
The Utes fought back in the second set after falling in another big hole, racking up seven straight points facing set point, but their comeback was made futile after senior middle blocker Lauren Williams notched the game’s decisive point at 25-21.
The Women of Troy took the third set handily 25-14, completing another sweep of a conference opponent.
Williams finished with a game-high 10 kills and three blocks on the day, matching her kill total the last time the two teams met.
Senior setter Kendall Bateman recorded 43 assists moving into third place on USC’s career list.
Leading the Pac-12 with a .405 hitting percentage, the senior has been a key reason for the Women of Troy’s recent success and her play in the middle has eased the pressure of the outside attack for USC.
“Williams’ off-the-court leadership has been kicking in, and although we want better blocking from her, she has been really good offensively,” Haley said. “Despite getting doubled, she’s still coming up with points.”
Morgan Odale led the way for Utah, totaling eight kills and three blocks. USC held Utah to a .037 hitting percentage in the first set and would only allow the Utes a .182 percentage for the entire match.
Next weekend, USC travels north to face Stanford and California.

The USC women’s cross-country team competed in its final non-championship race of the season, finishing fourth at the 2011 Cal State Fullerton Titan Invitational. The 5K course wound around the Cal State Fullerton campus, resulting in a flat, fast race.
The team, consisting of only seven of USC’s runners, finished behind Cal State San Marcos, UCLA and UC Santa Barbara for a total time of 1:33:42.00, or an 18:44.40 average.
Junior Shelby Buckley led the team with a fifth-place finish and a time of 17:43.8, setting her collegiate 5K personal record.
“[Buckley] competed very well and her racing instincts seem to be coming back,” USC coach Tom Walsh said. “This will help her mentally and physically as we head to Tempe next week for the Pac-12 championships.”
The next USC runner to cross the finish line was junior Kelly Owen in 24th place with 18:32.3, only a few seconds off her personal record set at last year’s Titan Invitational. Owen was followed closely by freshman Austin Lundin with a time of 18:39.2, another personal best. Junior Jessica Lundin finished in 36th, followed by freshman Erin Matranga in 38th. Rounding out the USC team were sophomore Anna Burger, with a 20:03.3 time in 46th place and sophomore Francesca Adamski, placing 55th with 20:51.5.
“Kelly Owen and Austin Lundin both had excellent races,” Walsh said. “Owen passed five girls in the last 150 meters to finish up a strong race. Lundin really pushed the last mile of the race.”
Owen, typically seen as a middle-distance runner, has performed well in this season’s long-distance cross-country races. Her impressive results in 5K and 6K races this season have made her a valuable asset to the team. Freshman Austin Lundin also shattered her previous personal best of 19:25.0.
The Titan Invitational was the last for all runners except Buckley, who will compete next weekend at the Pac-12 championships in Tempe, Ariz. The seven girls entered in that race are Buckley, freshmen Erica Capellino, Kira Soderstrom, Erin Robinson and Shannon Byrne, sophomore Jaclyn Walles and redshirt freshman Katie DeYoung.
“Everything is on target for this team to run its best race of the season next week at the Pac-12 championships,” Walsh said.

It’s a script that has been written before — so often, in fact, it has become almost cliché.
The echoes have been awakened, Notre Dame is back.
That much was indicated prior to Saturday night’s grudge match against USC.
Facing a USC team that had been underwhelming for much of its first six games, Notre Dame, near-double-digit favorites, hosted the Trojans in the first night game at Notre Dame Stadium in 21 years.
The Fighting Irish had a bye, they had homefield advantage and they had nearly 20 recruits on official visits, including Scout.com’s No. 1 overall prospect Arik Armstead who recently decommitted from USC.
Except, by the end, they didn’t have much fight.
“They just quit,” senior linebacker Chris Galippo said following the Trojans’ 31-17 win. “And that’s what Notre Dame football is about. They’re not anything like USC.”
If Notre Dame football is anything, it is a perpetual tease.
It looks flashy — overflowing with tradition. It has the Golden Dome. It has the Grotto. It has Touchdown Jesus.
But last year aside, it still doesn’t have the upper hand on USC, which has beaten Notre Dame nine times in the last 10 years.
There’s luster, sure, but at this point, there’s not much substance.
It’s hard not to become fixated on Notre Dame, especially at first sight. Call it easy on the eyes, quintessential college football from the golden helmets to the “Rakes of Mallow” played by the marching band.
Maybe all that’s what spawned the never-ending nationwide love affair with the Irish to begin with.
The Four Horsemen, however, haven’t been seen roaming the Indiana countryside in nearly 100 years.
In the last decade, USC has become an annual nightmare for Notre Dame in its never-ending quest to climb back to the top of the college football ladder.
In 2009, the Trojans handed No. 25 Notre Dame a 34-27 loss — its then second of the year.
In 2006, they routed the No. 6 Irish at the Coliseum by a score of 44-24.
In 2005, they broke the Irish’s hearts on the infamous “Bush Push” (no further explanation warranted).
Heck, even back in 2002, USC upended No. 7 Notre Dame convincingly, 44-13.
The sport’s arguably best rivalry isn’t supposed to be this one-sided. It’s supposed to be competitive, an annual back-and-forth heavyweight fight between two of the sport’s titans.
Except, the Trojans knocked out the Irish in the early rounds yet again.
Notre Dame had chances, sure, but USC — in a reflection of what has become almost habitual — stepped on its throat. Junior quarterback Matt Barkley and company marched out to a 17-0 lead, scoring on their first two possessions of the game. Then, when the Irish made it close, trailing by just seven and holding the ball at the one-yard line, quarterback Dayne Crist fumbled, leading to a Jawanza Starling touchdown return for a 14-point swing.
USC coach Lane Kiffin — almost as a fault — has been dubbed simply a good recruiter and smart playcaller. But if that is a recipe for success against Notre Dame, it certainly can suffice.
Kiffin has strung together two highly regarded top-five recruiting classes, and they more than delivered Saturday night.
Sophomore wide receiver Robert Woods finished with 12 receptions for 119 yards. Sophomore cornerback Nickell Robey, facing wide receiver Michael Floyd, limited the All-American to just four receptions for 28 yards.
In terms of recruiting, Notre Dame is supposed to be more than capable of standing toe-to-toe with USC.
But for 60 minutes, it looked more than evident: USC has the athletes and the speed. USC, as has been plainly evident over the last decade, is just better than 4-3 Notre Dame.
It has Woods, Robey.
It has freshman wide receiver Marqise Lee, who finished with two catches for 36 yards. It has Pete Carroll holdovers at tailback in junior Curtis McNeal and senior Marc Tyler, who finished with a combined 185 yards on the ground.
Perhaps, more surprisingly, it appears as if associate head coach Monte Kiffin also has his defense, which has forced eight turnovers in the last two weeks in addition to allowing just two touchdowns.
This is what Lane Kiffin’s USC was always supposed to look like: an efficient offense that struck early, a defense that bent — and bent plenty — but never broke.
And quite honestly, it’s something the Trojans can revel in. After all, they are now ranked No. 20 in the Associated Press top-25 poll as undefeated No. 4 Stanford marches into the Coliseum on Halloween weekend.
For now, this was unquestionably Lane Kiffin’s signature win. It took 20 games, but he got it and he got it convincingly.
“I would say so,” the second-year coach said when asked whether it was his biggest win as the Trojans’ head man. “We have not gone on the road with so much stuff going on. That’s why I would say it’s our team’s biggest win since we’ve been here because of all of the stuff around it.”
It might not be 2005, but with six wins, 2011 isn’t too shabby, either.

I agree with USCRoger’s comment regarding the infamous “Bush Push” it will go down in history as something memorable like, Maradona’s  “The Hand of God.” 
Overall, I loved how USC dominated possession during the 2nd half. ND turnover at the one yrd line was wonderful! Ahh, heck! ALL of their turnovers were priceless! 
I really hope the Trojans can shock Stanford this Saturday night!! I’m confident in our team, and I know they can get the job done at the Coliseum! 
Fight On! Everybody

The offensive line had been a question mark entering the season.
After losing tackle Tyron Smith, tackle Butch Lewis and center Kris O’Dowd to the NFL, three spots had to be filled for a front-five in rebuilding mode.
Despite the uncertainty facing this unit, the young USC offensive line has continued to show improvement all year. Against Notre Dame, the unit did not surrender a sack. The line also won the battle in the trenches, paving the way for the Trojans to register more than 200 rushing yards against the 19th-ranked defense in the Football Bowl Subdivision.
Off and running · Junior tailback Curtis McNeal finished with 118 rushing yards in leading the USC ground attack against Notre Dame. - Carlo Acenas | Daily Trojan
“I think [our offensive linemen] really wanted the challenge,” Kiffin said. “They played very physical in all aspects of the game.”
The rushing attack was impressive, finishing the game with a season-high 219 yards highlighted by junior running back Curtis McNeal’s 118 yards.
Junior quarterback Matt Barkley had plenty of time in the pocket to wait for routes to develop downfield. On one play in particular, Barkley connected with sophomore wide receiver Robert Woods for a 25-yard touchdown on a pump-and-go route. When coverage deep downfield did not relent, Barkley converted three third-downs on scrambles.
“They were dropping deep and you can’t really drop eight into coverage and not get some of the passing concepts that we wanted to,” Barkley said. “Sometimes you just have to take off and run. I was just trying to get positive yards and those happened on big plays where we needed first downs.”
—
At the beginning of the season, there was a possibility sophomore tailback Dillon Baxter could grab the starting role.
But Baxter has now only appeared in four games and recorded nine rushes for 29 yards.
The San Diego native did not make the trip to Notre Dame, either, but no further explanation was given.
“I’ll meet with Dillon when we get back,” Kiffin said. “He didn’t make the trip. That’s all I’ve got for you.”
—
Special teams has been an emphasis for USC all season long, but the normally reliable unit did not perform up to par against Notre Dame.
Notre Dame running back George Atkinson III returned a kickoff 96 yards for a touchdown in the second quarter, sparking a brief Irish run in the second quarter.
“[Special teams] was a big emphasis,” Atkinson said. “Coach emphasized that we need a big play out of special teams in order to get the win. That’s what we focused on all week and during the bye week.”
It was the first kickoff return for a touchdown USC has allowed all year.
Freshman kicker Andre Heidari was 1-for-2 on field goals for the game. Heidari missed a 37-yard field goal attempt in the fourth quarter after suffering an ankle injury to his kicking foot early in the second half.
“He’s a warrior,” special teams coordinator John Baxter said. “That hurt like heck, but he did it.”
Heidari is now 11-for-13 on the year.
—
Notre Dame wide receiver Michael Floyd was limited to four catches and 28 yards on the day, his lowest of the season since notching only four receptions and 27 yards against Pittsburgh.
Floyd is one of the most productive receivers in the country, with 53 catches on the year, good for eighth in the nation.
Sophomore cornerback Nickell Robey, who stands at 5-foot-8, was matched up against the 6-foot-3 Floyd for most of the game.
 
Quick hits
-USC brings the Jeweled Shillelagh back to Troy. Last year’s loss ended an eight-year streak of USC victories over Notre Dame.
-Saturday’s win was the first USC victory at Notre Dame Stadium since 2001.
-Notre Dame quarterback Tommy Rees was held without a touchdown pass for the first time in 11 games, the third-longest streak in school history.
 
Saturday’s win was the first USC victory at Notre Dame Stadium since 2001.
Incorrect. SC won in 2003, 2005, 2007 and 2009 since the 2001 season (thevyr SC lost).
I’ve seen that “stat” on some other sites now.  Does anyone know where its coming from?  We absolutely won in 2005, despite what the NCAA says–I saw the Bush Push in person.

The momentum had briefly shifted in Notre Dame’s favor.
The Fighting Irish had marched 71 yards down the field on their first possession of the second half to the USC 1-yard line almost seamlessly, on the verge of tying the game at 17.
Momentum swing · Junior safety Jawanza Starling recovered a fumble from quarterback Dayne Crist at the Notre Dame 1-yard line in the third quarter, scoring a touchdown to give the Trojans a 24-10 lead. - Carlo Acenas | Daily Trojan
But quarterback Dayne Crist, who had replaced starting signal caller Tommy Rees six plays earlier, fumbled the snap and junior safety Jawanza Starling scooped up the ball for an 80-yard touchdown to give the Trojans (6-1, 3-1) a 24-10 lead they would never relinquish en route to a 31-17 victory.
“Everything just slowed down,” Starling said. “I told myself I had to get it. I had to wait for the perfect bounce and not go for it too soon and miss it. That was a big momentum swing. To get a big play like that on defense changed the whole momentum.”
Though the play of the defense had been criticized, especially against Arizona State and Arizona, the Trojans held the Irish to just 267 yards of offense and just seven points in the second half.
Starling, who finished with four tackles, a fumble recovery and a touchdown, noticed the team’s different play.
“[It was] our mindset,” Starling said. “We were more focused [and] determined to shut up everybody who criticized the defense.”
The defense did its part in limiting the Irish, especially in the second half. Senior linebacker Chris Galippo recovered a botched lateral pass and sophomore cornerback Nickell Robey picked off Rees midway through the fourth quarter to essentially put the game away.
Robey also had the assignment of slowing down wide receiver Michael Floyd, the Irish’s top receiver, and limited him to just four receptions and 28 receiving yards.
“He was one of the main targets for us in stopping the passing game,” Robey said. “Coach trusted me enough to go at him one-on-one and that’s what I did. He’s a great player and I tip my hat off to him, but we did a great job of containing him.”
The Trojans also held Rees to just 190 passing yards and one interception. The running game for Notre Dame was also neutralized. Coming into the game, Notre Dame had been averaging 194 yards per contest, but the Trojans limited the Irish to just 41 yards on the ground and an average of 2.9 yards per carry.
USC’s defense might have been the highlight of the night, but it was the USC offense that got it going in the first quarter.
On USC’s first two offensive drives, senior tailback Marc Tyler carried eight times for 54 yards. The Trojans combined for 60 yards on 11 rushes in the half, and USC running backs coach Kennedy Polamalu noted the significance of establishing the running game early, especially on the road.
“It was important,” Polamalau said. “You have to take the physical part to them and we did that tonight. There are some things we need to get better at but tonight from my view, these young men played with their heart and passion and that’s all you can ask for.”
Junior tailback Curtis McNeal finished with 24 carries for 118 yards while Tyler finished with 13 carries for 67 yards. Tyler, who dislocated his left shoulder last week against California, started the game but had to leave because of an apparent leg injury in the second half.
McNeal suffered from cramps in the second half and had to leave for a short period of time. Polamalu was quick to praise USC’s two leading rushers.
“Those two are doing things right,” Polamalu said. “Their football IQ is off the charts, their toughness is off the charts. I’m not just talking about their physical toughness, but their mental toughness.”
USC’s passing game was also on target. Though Barkley and Woods struggled against California last week, the two bounced back in leading the Trojans’ offense.
Woods notched 12 receptions for 119 yards and two touchdowns while Barkley finished 24-of-35 for 224 yards and three touchdowns. USC coach Lane Kiffin praised the signal caller for his performance.
“Even though his numbers are not gigantic, if you don’t get sacked and you don’t turn the ball over with any fumbles or interceptions, you’re going to give us a good chance to win, and he did that,” Kiffin said.
And despite all the attention stemming from this historic rivalry, Barkley expressed the team’s focus throughout the week leading to the big game.
“With all the hype in games like this, it can be easy to stray away from who we are as a team,” Barkley said. “Our guys on offense and defense did a great job just focusing on us. Now we can soak in all this energy from this win and realize what we just did with this rivalry.”
USC returns to the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum to face Heisman candidate quarterback Andrew Luck and No. 4 Stanford next weekend.
BEAT THE CARDINAL!
Welcome back, USC.  Good game in the toughest of settings.  I hope those ND recruits were alert to their real possibilities.  And only one run called on third and long, with no two pointers.  One thing bothers me and that is the virtual disappearance of our kickoff game.  We are putting the kickoffs out there to what, their 40 yard line?  Their 20?  Their 20 is not even close to good enough.  If we can’t get our kickoffs into or out of the end zone, Andrew Luck and others will burn us badly.

Arts District was once a starving, dull blot east of Downtown Los Angeles spotted with industrial and railroad buildings devoid of human warmth.
Almost a decade later, the Arts District has transformed into a vibrant neighborhood, rejuvenated by artsy hipsters who moved into renovated loft-style apartments and by numerous new restaurants that sprouted in the once-deserted landscape. It’s a tit-for-tat phenomenon that has lifted the Arts District in popularity: More residents meant more eateries, and these new restaurants attracted new visitors, which cycled back to more residents.
Cultural chef · Edric Ocampo, the chef at NOLA’s, develops and executes NOLA’s menu to maintain its New Orleans authenticity. - Sophia Lee | Daily Trojan
One of the earliest people to foresee the potential of the Arts District was restaurateur Jason Ha, who restored a historic building into an Asian-fusion sushi restaurant in 2002.
Ha is a pioneer in revitalizing eastern Downtown’s dining scene. When he first came to the United States at 19 years old, he barely spoke a word of English. Walking around the college cafeteria with his lunch tray, he determinedly introduced himself to different tables each day with the only English sentence he knew: “Hello, I’m Jason. How are you?”
A couple of decades later, and Ha is now a Californian-ized Korean. He speaks perfect English with a California twang but retains dramatic Korean expressions. His skin is tanned from years of windsurfing with multi-ethnic friends, but he still attends a Korean church.
It was only fitting that the first restaurant he built in the Arts District was Zip Fusion Sushi, a sushi restaurant with a Californian twist and the hospitality of a Korean home. In fact, the “zip” in Zip Fusion means “home” in Korean, and Zip Fusion Sushi has the uncanny gift of remembering repeat customers by name.
Though sushi is a Japanese food, the chef leading the kitchen is Sean An, a Korean-American who once wowed the palates of high-ranking military officers during his military duty. His menu is innovative and localized, taking advantage of fresh local produce and seafood to create from the colossal Zip Fusion Roll (tuna, salmon, yellowtail, snapper, crab, cucumber and avocado) to the carb-conscious Whiskey and Soda Back Roll (no rice, tuna, salmon, egg, asparagus, crab, burdock root, avocado).
Since this successful venture, Ha’s progressive spirit has earned him the title “Mover and Shaker” of Downtown Los Angeles from the Los Angeles Center City Association in 2004. Ha is the epitome of the classic American dream come true; he’s an immigrant-turned-U.S. citizen whose fervent visions helped build a cultural niche in a historically rich neighborhood.
Ha has since collected more spaces at the same historical location to build two more restaurants: K-town BBQ and NOLA’s “A Taste of New Orleans.” Now dubbed “Ha’s Corner,” the trio of eateries is a rich melting pot of international flavors and local relationships.
Though directed under the same ownership, each restaurant at Ha’s Corner is unique. NOLA’s, opened about four months ago, is the latest example of the colorful interactions that take place under one roof.
NOLA’s is the collaboration between Ha and his long-time friend Cabrini Schnyder, a New Orleans native and now Downtown resident. Schnyder’s entrepreneurial chutzpah has carried her through an adventurous series of businesses in Los Angeles, from a mid-city jazz club to a downtown dog boutique, to the most recent New Orleans supper club in partnership with Ha.
Though Ha built the structural foundation for NOLA’s, Schnyder imbued New Orleans soul and color into it with her childhood tastes and memories. Their multiracial partnership — they call themselves a “husband and wife” team — glows with optimistic significance, especially because relationships between blacks and Koreans in Los Angeles have historically been rocky since the 1992 riots.
NOLA’s is a spot with great soul and character, providing a dynamic pulse to the once-obscure Arts District. The red-curtained stage at the back of the long dining hall lit with gothic lamps and shimmering candles is designed by the neighboring Southern California Institute of Architecture. Decked out with a grand piano and mike stands, the stage is open to local jazz and blues musicians who need a platform to showcase their vocal and instrumental talents.
Sophia Lee | Daily Trojan
NOLA’s menu is developed and executed by chef Edric Ocampo, who is Filipino-American but somehow keeps the authenticity in the New Orleans dishes intact. The crab claws, shrimp and calamari in his signature dish, Seafood Medley, retain all their juices while soaking in the rich, buttery broth zinging with a special NOLA’s house-blend of seasoning. NOLA’s jambalaya is simmered in brown roux with hand-stuffed andouille sausage and spices for the entire day until it is thick with aroma and flavor. A fat shrimp-studded gravy embraces an oasis of creamy white rice in the shrimp etouffe.
Dessert at NOLA’s is a collaboration with other local organizations. The raisin-spangled bread pudding, for example, is made with bread from Homeboy Industries, a Downtown-based non-profit that assists at-risk and formerly gang-involved youth.
K-town BBQ is currently in the middle of changes to better fit the Arts District personality. Ha has invited several local artists within the district to come and splatter their signature artsy flair onto the bare industrial walls.
The menu will also get a hipper fusion addition by Ocampo, who will unravel his Filipino heritage into new dishes, such as deep-fried pork belly with Filipino BBQ sauce, adobo chicken on garlic fried rice and Filipino-style pork and chicken skewers.
But that’s just the start of a series of relationships that weaves Ha’s Corner into the human fabric of Los Angeles. With plenty of music, food and drinks, Ha found a way to incorporate other cultures and flavors while staying true to the Los Angeles community.

When Alexandre Dumas wrote The Three Musketeers in 1844, he left out a few important details: The English invented airships, the musketeers were Muay Thai masters and Versailles was built approximately one King Louis ahead of schedule.
Paul W.S. Anderson set out to give his version of Dumas’ classic a modern edge. Though it sparkles with pretty costumes, pretty effects and very pretty men, Anderson’s vision slaps on a chastity belt, hacks off character traits and adds in massive technology for no reason other than looking cool. It plays like Pirates of the Caribbean meets Assassin’s Creed meets Brotherhood of the Wolf, but The Three Musketeers has half the soul of any of them.
The film follows the story of D’Artagnan (Logan Lerman), a poor young nobleman from the country who wants to become one of the king’s musketeers. Musketeering’s not such a hot job now though, as three of the most famous musketeers, Athos (Matthew Macfadyen), Porthos (Ray Stevenson) and Aramis (Luke Evans) have nothing better to do than to challenge teenage boys to life-or-death duels.
It’s not long before D’Artagnan is drawn into political intrigue. Cardinal Richelieu (Christoph Waltz) rules over a weak and foppish King Louis XIII (Freddie Fox) and wants to start a war with England. To do so, he hires the deadly Milady de Winter (Milla Jovovich) to make it look like the queen is having an affair with the Duke of Buckingham (Orlando Bloom). But the duke thinks de Winter is working for him, while Athos, her ex-husband/boyfriend/piece on the side thinks she’s just a treacherous witch.
To save the day, the queen’s lady in waiting goes to D’Artagnan. He has just fallen in love with her, so she uses his budding affections to run to England and foil the nefarious plot. Apparently desperate, D’Artagnan complies, and the three musketeers join in to help.
Massive characterization changes are the chief difference between the film and the novel. Originally Lord Buckingham was the lovelorn paramour of the queen of France. Now he’s a swaggering villain and London’s reigning fashionista. There is a difference between being hammy and satiric — Bloom skitters across both.
As far as the other villains, Cardinal Richelieu is given the Hollywood wash out. Waltz, so charismatically evil in Inglourious Basterds, is given little to do here but twirl his mustache and make snarky veiled insults. Perhaps with better direction he could be allowed to give Richelieu more of an “I love to slaughter Huguenots and put down feudal lords” air of menace, but as it stands he’s pure camp.
D’Artagnan is the chief sore spot casting-wise. His character is young and cocky but also charming and, despite his nativity, quite intelligent, yet Lerman is simply pretty and charmless, bringing little to the part.
Other musketeers are better cast, particularly Stevenson as Porthos. But as cool as a French Titus Pullo sounds, none of the musketeers is given much in way of speech or gravitas. They have plenty of action scenes but no characterization beyond basic stage direction and what the actors can pack into the simple dialogue.
Jovovich is a crystalline huntress as Milady de Winter, the series’ most iconic antagonist. She’s gorgeous and fierce but there is little to the character, as the film has axed most of her tumultuous love story.
Instead, the larger question becomes: Where on earth did a 17th-century noblewoman learn Ninjutsu? At the same time, she lacks the same fangs her literary counterpart had; in the original novel, she poisoned and seduced characters with glee. Her body count’s gone up, but her scary factor has not.
French literature is saucy enough without modern touches. Forget English novels full of teenagers swooning over Mr. Darcy’s cravats. The French were totally open to their characters having one-night stands and extramarital affairs. The original novel had more sex, more murder and a lot more moments of action and derring-do than the film. This version has gorgeous costumes, sparkling set pieces and some very nice shooting locations. Still, little life exists beneath the green-screened surface.
The inclusion of an airship is the least of the film’s problems. A steam-punkish version of The Three Musketeers sounds fascinating, but not without the witty dialogue, earnest action and all-around fun that made the novel such a classic. People interested in the characters behind these glittering facades should check out the 1973 version with Charlton Heston and Michael York. Or even — gasp — pick up the novel.
Logan Lerman is the hottest Jewish boy ever.

The El Rey Theatre on Wilshire in the Miracle Mile district carries the feel of an old jazz era ballroom with tables against the parallel walls and a bar opposite the stage. The velvet curtain opened on Mason Jennings holding an autoharp as if it were a sacrificial lamb.
The intimately diverse crowd went ecstatic in a respectable way (save for the buzzed-cut over-21 gentleman who yelled, “I would go gay for you!” in the wordless parts of the opening of “Rudy”).
Jennings certainly did attract a varied group of passionate, warm fans: women in their forties, recently divorced, wearing heels when they really shouldn’t have; couples swaying together, cupped into each other, boy kissing girl’s ears; grim, flannelled, bearded young men in packs sipping beer, breaths reeking of cigarettes and gum.
This must say something about Mason Jennings, whose musical catalog invites him to shift from aforementioned autoharp to piano to acoustic guitar to electric and finally to drums. He didn’t merely group his different types of songs together — keyboard and keyboard, acoustic and acoustic — but instead charmingly bounced around according to tone and energy of the set list, as if he were making a poem.
He managed to cover Woody Guthrie — in the encore, again on the autoharp, which his wife inherited from her grandmother — and The Ramones “I Wanna Be Sedated” was embedded within his heavy Blood of Man track “Aint No Friend of Mine” without bending focus from his own energy. He even played a Hawaiian lullaby his mother used to sing to him.
The opening band, The Pines, who Jennings repeatedly touted during the show as “one of [his] favorite bands in the world,” set a darkly rustic tone with their Iowan blues/folk roots — plenty of slide guitar, harmonies and airy bandit vocals that brought to mind images of brown leaves in a brown river, serving as the perfect complement to Jennings’ own folk twang.
Jennings plays and sings as if discovering himself during the show. Lyrics he wrote years ago — like And if this darkness came from light/ then light can come from darkness I guess from an old meditation called “Drinking As Religion” — still seem to cut deep into some emotional wound.
His set lasted about an hour and a half, but he fit what must have been 25 songs into the show, spanning from his debut eponymous album to the recently released Minnesota. Each album spoke to a different theme: the folk album, the blood/electric album, the acoustic album, the album about home.
In a musical world where talented, progressive musicians prove themselves through drastically complicated and unbelievable arrangements in order to be separated from the pack, Jennings keeps it simple. He’s prolific — but calm about it all; mania seems to have dripped out of this man.
Toward the end of the show Jennings announced that afterward, if the audience gave him a little time, he would come to the merchandise stand to say hello. “It’d be great to meet everybody,” he said.
Almost 10 minutes after his last song, he joined The Pines by the T-shirt booth and let people approach him in a line, shaking hands, giving about a minute of earnest conversation about anything or everything.
He walked through the auditorium without any airs, like he’d merely been one of the crowd who happened to watch the show from onstage.
It’s almost like the best parts of the world of art were allowed in one place, one situation: a musician with a personal attachment to his audience (and vice versa), and an immense talent, who has the ability to set you at ease in conversation, who could just as easily act as if he’d never written anything you’d ever heard of, like he was just your best friend’s very nice and very spiritual older brother.

LGBT rights are slowly but surely advancing in America on the national and local levels. “Don’t ask, don’t tell” was officially repealed in September. California passed a law last week that requires public schools to teach students — from kindergarteners to high schoolers — about LGBT Americans as a part of U.S. history courses. San Diego State University created California’s first LGBT major, to be offered in spring 2012.
Rita Yeung | Daily Trojan
California’s new law and SDSU’s groundbreaking new major underscore the importance of education in generating progress in LGBT rights. Legislature is necessary for change, but perhaps what this fight for rights really needs is a shift from the courts to the classroom.
There’s still much progress to be made.  Parents have withdrawn children from school in response to the recently passed law. Same-sex marriage is legal in six states — New York, Massachusetts, Connecticut, Iowa, Vermont and New Hampshire — but not in California. Proposition 8 was overturned last August, but it is currently under stay, which prevents any new same-sex marriages.
When it comes to higher education, LGBT education is complex; and really is the most critical place for the movement to grow.
LGBT education is different at each level of schooling. For elementary school students, educators say it’s more appropriate to stick to lessons on family diversity and anti-bullying, rather than sex or LGBT figures’ roles in history.
For middle- and high school-age students, sex education becomes more important as it fills in the gaps where the LGBT community has previously been left out in history lessons.
Without LGBT studies there can be no increase in knowledge, or research. Without further research, textbooks or information for younger students to learn about, LGBT issues cannot be improved. And without it, there is a lack of support for the community.
Gender studies exists at many universities, but there’s a distinct lack of LGBT-specific education. SDSU is one of only two schools in the nation, along with Hobart and William Smith Colleges in upstate New York, to offer such a major. City College of San Francisco is also waiting for approval to offer an associates degree in LGBT studies.
The creation of such a major is a sign of increasing acceptance and equality for LGBT students.
It’s understandable that parents take children out of school because of California’s new law — whether for religious or personal reasons — but at the university level, it’s different. Students who don’t agree with LGBT education are unaffected. They can choose not to participate.
By doing so, however, they would miss out on educational and professional benefits. Non-LGBT students stand to gain from the expansion of LGBT education.
According to a study published by the Stanford School of Medicine in September, American medical schools are falling behind in LGBT-health-related curriculum. The study surveyed deans from medical schools on time colleges spend on LGBT issues and found one-third of the colleges surveyed had zero exposure to LGBT issues in the clinical years.
For current pre-med students, applying to medical school armed with a major or a minor and foundational knowledge of LGBT issues could provide a real edge to fill this educational gap.
Employers are always looking for candidates with not just a diverse educational background, but an understanding of diversity, a critical skill for pretty much any career today.
The increasing attention on LGBT rights also has exciting potential to create entire new fields of study across disciplines: from history and literature to medicine and law.
USC offers a gender studies major and minor as well as an entire LGBT resource center. Why not be a pioneering university and expand USC’s resources even further by offering education on LGBT topics?

Just to mention that the USC medical program does sponsor LGBT health discussions with LGBT leaders from around Los Angeles and it’s an opportunity for each class to learn about working with LGBT patients; there also is a transgender educational panel that is frequently sponsored by the medical program. Although there can be more; this is a positive step in the right direction at USC.

Excellent article and in complete agreement that all colleges and universities should at the very least have courses on LGBTQ issues, and preferably majors.  There should also be, as in California, state wide mandated age appropriate education in all our public school systems.
 The first undergraduate major in LGBT Studies was established at Hobart and William Smith Colleges in Generva NY. Graduates with LGBT Majors  have gone on to work in areas as diverse as the Peace Corps and Rochester Institute of Technology. Hobart was founded by Bishop Henry Hobart in 1822, and is still an associate college of the Episcopal Church.

The remodeling of the USC Caruso Catholic Center on the corner of 32nd and Hoover Streets will benefit Trojans by providing them with a larger and more prominent location in which to worship. The center is being built entirely with non-university funds provided by alumni and friends of the university, keeping the school free of religious affiliation.
Though the money for this addition to USC’s religious life is coming from Trojans’ own pockets, the Catholic Center’s renewal is a worthwhile expenditure. Like any other community center, it will help foster friendships within the Trojan community, will help lonely students overcome feelings of homesickness and will increase participation in community service events.
The European-style church, community center, outdoor courtyard and events plaza will serve as major assets to USC’s Catholic community by encouraging students to intermingle at religious gatherings. By fostering fellowship and nurturing the spiritual life of church participants, as the institution’s mission statement declares, the Catholic Center will provide another location for members of the Trojan Family to get to know one another and to bond over shared ideals.
The decision to remodel the Catholic Center initially sparked minor controversy among non-Catholic members of the Trojan Family, who mistakenly thought the university had sponsored the upgrade. Indeed, a decision by USC administration to use university funds to expand the center would have been unfair and would have required the school to sponsor the construction of other religious centers to remain in compliance with USC’s lack of religious affiliation, valid since its 1880 inclusion in the school charter. According to the center’s website, the expansion of the church, along with the center itself, was funded by “the generosity of alumni, parents, and friends.” As such, the university has no financial stake in its well-being.
The advancement of the Catholic Center’s profile as one of USC’s 57 religious organizations will be especially significant to out-of-state students, religious and non-religious, who might be homesick and feeling out of touch with their spirituality as a result of being so far away from friends and family. Paying a visit to the new Catholic Center, especially with its improved resources and increased emphasis on fellowship, could help students adjust to the dramatic change in environment by making them feel closer to God, to a higher power or to other community members.
The expansion of the Catholic Center will also allow for possible increases in participation in important community service events. According to the center’s website, the center’s Social Justice team puts together and executes philanthropic events and initiatives such as blood drives, Alternative Spring Break, where church members build houses in underprivileged areas, Adopt-A-Family, where donors buy gifts for impoverished families, Relay for Life; the Homeless Ministry; and a book/clothing drive. If more people know about the church’s presence on Hoover Street, attendance in services is likely to increase — and knowledge about these meaningful fundraisers, campaigns and trips will be more widespread.
 
Lindsay Dale is a freshman majoring in communication. 
In response to Jett Rucker’s comments, the basis for any free and open society is the Constitutional right to freedom of speech – no matter how questionable or objectionable we may find particular points of view to be. In fact throughout human history, draconian measures that limit free speech usually have had the opposite effect on views and ideologies which were deemed objectionable by some. Based on your comments, one would assume you would be rather quite familiar with the Weimar Republic failed attempt’s to silence the views of a madman in 1920s Munich. Ultimately, those attempts to marginalize his views ultimately fed Hitler’s appeal. It would seem that anyone who supports the suppression of free speech has little or no confidence in “the general public’s” ability to choose for themselves, which in ugly elitism at it’s worst.
Freedom of speech is a right the GOVERNMENT pledges not to abridge – the rest of us abridge each other’s freedom of speech all the time, and with perfect right, both here and in Germany, both now and back then. I object, of course, to the exercise of this right (to abridge my freedom of speech) against me on this subject, but I don’t deny it IS a right. I have the right to slander THEM, too, though I decline to exercise this right beyond exposing what they actually do.
The project to oppose Hitler came from his political opponents, not, strictly speaking, from the Weimar Republic. After 1924, few legal restraints were exercised upon him (they would, today, on the basis of official defense of racial equality AND anti-Nazism).
Anyway, a lot of Germans wanted what Hitler appeared to be offering. As to the ultimate outcome, obviously, not even Hitler wanted THAT.
I hope you followed my links to view Hillel/ADL’s Manual. It’s a corker.
But wasn’t USC founded as a Methodist School? One of the Three Sisters?
Does the Catholic Center have a manual such as that used by the Hillel Foundation (your opposite number on campus for the Jewish religion) for dealing with advertising in the Trojan of historical views that it finds objectionable? The Manual (a must-see) may be viewed at http://www.adl.org/education/Fighting-Holocaust-Denial-on-Campus.pdf.
The Hillel manual, “Fighting Holocaust Denial in Campus Newspaper Advertisements – A Manual for Action”, is, as its title conveys, a manual detailing how to prevent advertising by such as the Committee for Open Debate on the Holocaust (CODOH) from appearing and, in the event anything DOES get into print, how to make the staff of the Trojan regret that they didn’t stop it. (They DO stop it now, since they don’t want “the treatment” set forth in the Manual.)
The Inquisition might be a good historical subject for your group to start with. But first, you need someone (CODOI?) seeking to advertise objectionable views concerning it. You should be able to arrange that by launching a vigorous, sustained, lavishly funded campaign in the larger society to stigmatize all discussion of the subject that portrays the event in any light unflattering to your church or its adherents then or now.

USC’s Graduate and Professional Student Senate, in partnership with USC Transportation and Los Angeles County Metro, has launched a program that provides discounted Metro TAP cards to full-time graduate students. A launch party took place at The Lab Gastropub on Oct. 20.
Typically, Metro TAP cards for students cost about $75 for 9 weeks. Under the new partnership, they’re available for $25, valid through to Dec.17, 2011. The arrangement includes an unlimited number of trips on the on Metro Bus and Rail, Metro Rapid and Metro Liner.
Prior to this program, Metro TAP cards required students to be enrolled for a minimum of 12 units. However, graduate students typically take only 8-10 units in a semester, and professional students only three. The new program has no such eligibility criteria and is available to all graduate students who are enrolled full-time at USC.
The card can be applied for at the USC Transportation website. It is reusable for several semesters and can also be used as a regular Metro pass after graduation.
