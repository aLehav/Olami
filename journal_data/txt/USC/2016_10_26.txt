Identity is everything in the FBS, but not for the USC Trojans.
In a season characterized by constant personnel loss and offensive restructuring, the Trojans (4-3) have an opportunity to advance in the Pac-12 South with a victory over the Cal Bears (4-3) tonight at the Coliseum.
The Trojans are dealing with already having lost redshirt junior defensive tackle Kenny Bigelow, redshirt junior wide receiver Steven Mitchell Jr and Osa Masina.
And while the Cal and USC men’s water polo teams have better chances to capture NCAA titles than do the football teams, a win on Thursday night could be the difference between rebuilding and restarting.
“Any time you go seven games straight, you’re going to get some bumps and bruises,” head coach Clay Helton told the media after practice on Sunday. “They’re fresh. They’re bouncing with energy and great juice. That comes from being one game out of first place in the south. It’s an exciting time right now, and I’m looking forward to it.”
Prior to their 52-6 drubbing at the hands of the Alabama Crimson Tide, the Trojans were identified as the 20th-best team in the nation. They were identified as the same run-and-shoot USC team that would bring in an experienced pocket passer and utilize their potential Heisman candidate running back to supply the fire for a defense that relied on its linemen up front.
But, as much as tonight’s game is about rebuilding and restarting, it’s also about redefining, and four games ago, USC started its transformation.
No longer is the prototypical pocket-passing quarterback Max Browne the starter. No longer is Ronald Jones II the bona fide Heisman candidate we thought he was, and no longer does USC’s passing defense struggle to contain opposing quarterbacks.
The reason USC holds a 4-3 record in 2016 after an embarrassing loss on national television is because they allowed their own future plans to define them, not their past experiences or their opponents’ expectations.
After losing three of their first four, redshirt freshman starting quarterback Sam Darnold has averaged 315 yards and 3.6 touchdowns on a 68-of-102 passing with 84 yards and a touchdown on the ground in his past three games.
“The way [Browne] competed and performed was more than honorable, but the realism of football is when you’re 1-2 and you’ve scored one touchdown against Alabama and Stanford,” Helton said. “I want to see a spark in our offense, and I hope that Sam can bring that. I’m confident in it after watching three games of watching him perform, seeing him in the arena and seeing what he can do.”
Instead of USC running just Jones, the Men of Troy have rushed for 175.5 yards per game thanks to a mix of Jones, senior Justin Davis, sophomores Aca’Cedric Ware and Dominic Davis.
On defense, the Trojans have held their past three opponents to an average of 17 points per game and 52.4 percent completion through the air thanks to nine sacks, four interceptions and two fumble recoveries.
Though Troy’s 2016 season is characterized with breaking expectations, there are certain facets of their identity that remain paramount to success.
For example, the expectation of another top-10 season for junior wide receiver JuJu Smith-Schuster is just starting to come to fruition — thanks to Darnold, however.
Before Darnold, Smith-Schuster caught just 11 passes for 99 yards and two touchdowns. During Darnold’s tenure, Smith-Schuster has 29 receptions for 466 yards and six touchdowns.
“Whenever I have the chance to get it out to him, I know he’s going to do something special with it,” Darnold said.
Along with Smith-Schuster’s success, USC’s 11-game winning streak over Cal should remain an expectation that Helton’s squad hopes to maintain.
Against Cal, a team that USC has defeated every season since 2003, the Trojans have the potential to start their ascension towards a Pac-12 title.
Other than winning nearly 70 percent of their Thursday games, the Men of Troy hold an all-time 67-30-5 record versus the Golden Bears and a 56-17-1 line in games immediately following their bye week since 1995.
No strangers to shattered expectations themselves, Cal’s head coach Sonny Dykes’ squad was projected to be an afterthought in the Pac-12. Instead, they’ve become the only team in the conference to down top-dog Utah, two top-25 teams and rank among the best in the nation for their exceptional passing offense.
“Every time you play a team that scores 43 points, you better be scoring some points of your own. In this game, I don’t think field goals will be good enough,” Helton said. “We’ve really preached about being pros. They really want to be a good football team, and in order to do that, you need to put in the extra time.”
Thanks to the efforts of Texas Tech-transfer senior quarterback Davis Webb (2,581 passing yards and 27 touchdowns) and senior running back Khalfani Muhammad (525 rushing yards and two touchdowns), Cal has averaged 43.7 offensive points per game this year.
The only expected downside of Cal’s team has been their defense which ranks in the bottom 10 in total yards and points allowed.
That considered, the Bears’ offense has managed to keep things close despite playing some of the Pac-12’s best.
Excluding their 51-31 romp over Hawaii in week one, Cal has either won or lost by an average of 5.5 points. With such a slim margin of victory and defeat, the Trojans have to be careful toward the end of the game when every possession matters.
Overall, this game will be about confirming or shattering expectations for both teams. If Cal pulls out a victory, it would be the first road victory against USC in over 15 seasons, while a USC victory would signal a complete fortune reversal from their abysmal 1-3 start and a potential route to a Pac-12 South title.
One thing that will be for certain: Cal wants this game badly.
“I don’t remember the score, but I remember the whipping we got my freshman year. Ever since then, the goal was to make sure we beat the crap out of them or die trying,” said Cal senior left guard Chris Borrayo to the San Francisco Chronicle. “It was a pretty nasty game my freshman year, and I don’t know if you guys understand this about USC: Class is not in their name. It’s something important to me and something very important to our team to know we’re going out there trying to win. I want to beat the crap out of USC.”
This time around, expect Cal to play a tough game. SC should bring their very best for four quarters. By the way, I read somewhere that one of the Cal linemen wants to “kick USC’s ass.” I guess he’s been tweeting. Not showing a lot of respect for SC. Looks like Cal expects to rub dirt in SC’s face and humiliate the Trojans.

This past week, Whittingham moved into the fourth position in all-time career digs at USC and is expected to move into third before she graduates.
“She is a walk-on and she is setting records,” head coach Mick Haley said. “That is pretty darn special.”
Whittingham is an inspiration to all walk-on athletes of what they can accomplish through hard work and perseverance. On top of that, she is also a leading force on the court for her teammates as her experience, her attitude and her presence on the court are something they have come to rely on.
“She is such a calming force and is never freaking out,” freshman outside hitter Khalia Lanier said. “You just have to look to the veterans on the court and she keeps me in check.”
Being chosen as captain is not something that Whittingham takes lightly either. Part of her impact on the court is through the younger players that have the chance to learn from her. However, she also feels as if she is constantly learning from them too, while helping to continue to build the legacy of USC’s program.
“I really pride myself in being a calming force out there,” Whittingham said. “Any way that I can help others and that they can help me in return is something that is really important.”
This season, Haley and the team had a taste of what it will be like without her, as she suffered an injury to her right knee that kept her off the court for a week. While a week is a small period of time in the grand scheme of injuries, not having the staple of their defense was felt by everyone.
“There is no question it is a big difference not having Taylor out there,” Haley said. “If Taylor could have been playing with us against UCLA and Washington, we feel like we would have had a much better match in each of those situations and possibly could have won.
“We want to have her in there even if it is one-legged,” Haley said, laughing.
Her time out of the games was not much easier on Whittingham, as she always wants to be on the court making a difference. She had a lot of praise for the strength coaches helping her to get back so quickly — with a lot of rehab and icing — but also lauded her teammates for adjusting to her abrupt absence.
“It was hard being on the sidelines, just wanting to contribute and help my team,” Whittingham said. “It was definitely a quick change and something they didn’t expect, but I think they did a great job when I wasn’t out there.”
Her drive to make a difference is one of the many reasons she has been named a candidate for the 2016 Senior CLASS Award —  an award for NCAA Division I senior athletes who excel both on and off the court in the community, the classroom, their character and competition. Whittingham is the fourth candidate from USC to be nominated and the last since All-American libero Natalie Hagglund in 2013.
Whittingham’s list of accomplishments in her time at USC is impressive given the countless hours she puts into the gym and school at the same time. She has a 3.00 cumulative GPA in both her major, communication, and minor, consumer behavior, has led the Pac-12 in digs in both the 2014 and 2015 season and is a three-time Pac-12 Defensive Player of the Week winner.
Off the court, she has participated in service projects at the Los Angeles Children’s Hospital and served as a counselor for USC’s annual inner-city outreach program. She was also a counselor for the Girl Scouts program in 2014-2015  and even found time to go to China with the Pac-12 All-Star Team in the summer of 2016 to put on free volleyball clinics.
With all she has done for both the women’s volleyball team and the school itself, Whittingham has certainly established a legacy at USC. Whittingham’s influence and leadership are things that will stay with this team even after she is gone.

The Women of Troy hit the road this weekend as they continue their fight for dominance in the Pac-12.
Julia Erickson | Daily TrojanLock it down · Senior goalkeeper Sammy Jo Prudhomme won her fourth Pac-12 Goalkeeper of the Week award and has 10 shutouts this year.
Ranked No. 2 in the conference and No. 4 in the nation, the women’s soccer team is entering a critical three-game stretch to finish out a dominant season of conference play. The team first heads to Salt Lake City on Thursday to take on Utah, then travels to Boulder for a Sunday game against Colorado.
For most of this season, Utah has been a solid middle-tier team, recovering from early pre-season losses to win steadily and sit tight in the middle of the Pac-12 rankings. After tying with Cal in double overtime last week, the team has proved that it can compete with the top dogs in the conference.
The Buffs, meanwhile, are ranked third in the Pac-12. After a soft start to the season, they suffered another loss to Stanford last weekend before knocking off Cal 3-2 in double overtime. The Trojans will take on Colorado after the Buffs play against UCLA, a team ranked No. 9 in the country who provides stiff competition for stealing one of the top rankings in the conference, on Thursday.
The bottom line is that dominance in the Pac-12 is completely up for grabs. At the top is USC, neck-and-neck with Stanford for the No. 1 ranking in the Pac-12  as the season comes to a close. And for USC head coach Keidane McAlpine, that makes this final weekend on the road even more important.
“It’s that time of year,” McAlpine said. “All the games you have to show up and you have to play. The games are important for us because we’re still trying to peak [and] reach that next level.”
This weekend’s games come after two more shutouts for the Trojans against Washington and Washington State, adding up to 10 on the season for redshirt senior goalkeeper Sammy Jo Prudhomme. After notching five saves over the weekend, Prudhomme earned her second-straight Pac-12 Goalkeeper of the Week award and her fourth of the season.
Prudhomme’s performance alongside senior defender Mandy Freeman has pulled together a young defensive corps, turning a backline that struggled to connect at the season’s start into one of the most dominant defenses in the country.
“The competition from here on out is just gonna get better,” McAlpine said. “Every game, there’s gonna be a moment when [Prudhomme] is gonna have to make a big save on top of some of the simple saves.”
After this weekend, the Trojans will return home for one last stop — a rivalry matchup against UCLA that will decide the final rankings for the Pac-12. Then, it will be go-time for McAlpine and his team as they begin their journey in the NCAA tournament.

The bane of the football season has arrived. It’s the Thursday night game — something few love and many despise. I fall into the majority on this one, and I think that playing a football game in the Coliseum on a Thursday isn’t fair to the students or a good idea.
The Thursday night football game is a contradiction for a University that claims to put a great value on both academics and student life — this game makes students choose one or the other.
When I was a freshman, I remember thinking that it was really cool that we got to play on a Thursday night, but of course as I have gone deeper into my course work and gotten more involved with my extracurricular activities, a Thursday night game just cuts into the amount of time that I can spend studying and working without feeling like I’m missing out on something.
In an attempt to compromise, USC bans all tailgating on campus and on the Row for Thursday games, but that takes away a lot of the fun of going to a school where football is such a big deal. I’m not saying that the only way to enjoy a football game is to be blackout drunk before it happens, but there is a certain culture surrounding the games and many students, myself included, feel cheated out of one weekend of this experience when the game is held on a Thursday.
If the University were going to cancel all its classes on Thursdays to allow the game to fully take over, then there wouldn’t be this struggle for power. But it isn’t just Thursday or Thursday afternoon classes that would need to be considered — what about Friday?
I am one of the many who purposely schedules my classes so that I have a three-day weekend every week, but for many people, and nearly every science major, this luxury just isn’t a reality.
This semester I have a class that is from 4 p.m.- 5:40 p.m. on Thursday, and my professor canceled it. I have friends who don’t get out of class until 6 or 7 p.m. and their professors haven’t given them the day off. Now these students have to decide if they would rather attend the football game or their class, a decision that is utterly unfair for someone who is paying for both.
So then it comes to a tipping point. Would a student rather skip the game so that they can commit the necessary time to their schoolwork, something that costs roughly $33,000 this semester or go to the football game, something they also had to put out $185 for?
It doesn’t seem fair to force the students into this predicament every year. In an email to the student body, Vice President for Student Affairs Ainsley Carry addressed the many troubles that come with the Thursday night game.
“As a member of the Pac-12 Conference, USC will occasionally host home football games at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum on weekdays,” Carry wrote.
For the three years that I have been a student here, USC has hosted a Thursday night game. Even though “occasionally” may mean only once a semester, “occasionally” should mean once every few seasons. Spread the wealth!
Of course, on a Thursday night, USC has a greater chance of competing with the NFL for viewership than Oregon State does, but the conference should put its priority on its students and student-athletes instead of chasing down the dollars.
Now of course, USC would never say that they expect you to go to the football game instead of your classes. In fact, Carry even told the student body what is expected of them tonight.
“Classes will be held on Thursday, Oct. 27 and students will be expected to attend class in accordance with the syllabus set by their faculty instructor.”
I hope you have as understanding of a professor as I do.
Hailey Tucker is a junior majoring in broadcast and digital journalism. She is also the sports editor of the Daily Trojan. Her column, “Tucker Talks,” runs Thursdays.
While I like many others am a dedicated USC football fan, I never saw this as an issue while I was a student. At the end of the day, you are there for school and that should be your priority. If anything, you can check the score during class. Additionally, Thursday games only happen once, maybe twice a year. Missing one game does not make you any less of a fan.

The No. 3 men’s water polo team will have an opportunity for revenge against the No. 2 Cal Bears (15-2) on Saturday following a nonconference matchup with the Claremont-Mudd-Scripps Stags (10-12) on Thursday night.
Emily Smith | Daily TrojanThursday night lights · Junior driver Matteo Morelli and the No. 3 men’s water polo team host two games this weekend, starting with Claremont on Thursday at 5 p.m. They play No. 2 Cal at 6:30 p.m. on Saturday.
Coming off a big 13-8 win over No. 6 Long Beach State this weekend, USC (16-1) has rattled off eight straight wins, seven of them thanks to double-digit scoring.
Against the 49ers, the Trojans were outscored early 3-2, but were able to bounce back and obtain an 11-6 lead going into the final frame despite a raucous Long Beach State crowd.
“It was a really tough game in the beginning,” junior driver Matteo Morelli said. “As the game went on, we scored a couple goals, and the momentum went our way. That is a tough pool to play in. It’s a good crowd.”
USC got out of Long Beach with a 13-8 victory. Nine different Trojans scored goals, including four who had two goals.
With the momentum gained from their latest top-10 win, the Men of Troy have a chance to make a legitimate claim for the nation’s No. 2 spot versus Claremont and Cal.
At 10-12, Claremont has experienced adversity against talented teams this year, sporting a 2-12 record against teams in the top-25.
With just 19 players to mix in and out of the pool, the Stag’s lack of roster depth has troubled them, especially late in games.
In terms of USC’s game plan for Claremont, the Trojans are playing with the same attitude as every other contest this season.
“We just need to be ready to win the game,” senior driver Nick Bell said. “We go into every game like it’s the championship game; we can’t think about anything else. Cal’s coming up, and it will be a fun game.”
After their meeting with Claremont on Thursday, USC will play host to Cal, the same team that gave USC its first and only loss in September at Cal’s invitational tournament earlier this month.
Ten games later, the Trojans are preparing for a similar offensive assault that downed them earlier in the season.
In a close 10-8 loss, the Trojans mounted a furious five-goal comeback after being down 6-2 at halftime. By the end of four periods, the Bears and their six different scorers proved to be too much for the USC defense.
“I was a little disappointed we weren’t able to pull off first place, but it’s difficult playing away games, and playing Cal at Cal is difficult with their home crowd,” junior driver Grant Stein said. “To get back up, we try and motivate each other with support to lift each other’s spirits in that huddle.”
Cal’s Johnny Hooper, the former MPSF Newcomer of the Year and current leading goal scorer, has fired in 50 total goals in 2016, including three goals against USC.
Along with Hopper’s 50, Safak Simsek (20) and Odysseas Masmanidis (17) can each provide scoring support should the Trojans bottle Hopper up.
If the Men of Troy survive Saturday’s contest, a No. 2 spot in the national rankings is imminent. But before they take on Cal, the Trojans need to take care of business against the Stags. Thursday’s game is at 5 p.m., and Saturday’s contest begins at 6:30 p.m.

Looking for their fourth straight victory, the Trojans welcome the Cal Bears to the Coliseum for a Thursday night clash. Both teams are coming into the game with an overall record of 4-3. USC is 3-2 in conference play and Cal is 2-2.
Brian Chin | Daily TrojanBear trap · Sophomore defensive back Marvell Tell III (left) and senior linebacker Michael Hutchings (right) are part of a defense tasked with stopping a Cal offense that has the second highest pace in the nation.
USC has not lost to Cal since 2003 and has limited them to 15 points per game during that time, but head coach Clay Helton is preparing his team for what he anticipates will be an up-tempo and high-scoring affair.
“The other thing we worked on was third-down efficiency,” Helton said. “This is a group that as you watched them at Oregon had a 15-play drive, 14-play drive, 13-play drive … so the biggest thing for us with any quarterback is trying to get him off his spot.”
Cal’s senior quarterback Davis Webb has Helton’s attention as one of the elite passers in the conference. Davis has thrown 27 touchdowns this year, the most in the conference and the second-most in the country. Davis also leads the Pac-12 in passing yards per game with 368.7 and total offense per game with 356.4 yards.
Davis’ success has partially been due to his connection with redshirt junior wide receiver Chad Hansen, who leads the conference in receiving yards per game with 128.3. Hansen is recovering from a foot injury and his status for Thursday’s game is hopeful said Cal head coach Sonny Dykes.
Cal plays at a frenetic pace, averaging 89.6 plays per game, the second most in the nation.
“When you’re dealing with an explosive team like that and a quarterback like that, it’s just something you have to be ahead on,” senior linebacker Michael Hutchings said.
The Trojans have had plenty of time to prepare though, coming off of a bye week. By contrast, Cal played their last game just six days ago. It is the first time in conference history that a team has had to play a short-week conference game on the road against a team who is coming off of a bye week.
“We have had a chance to get up ahead of them mentally and game-plan wise and schematically,” Hutchings said. “So hopefully that pays off — the extra hours we put in the film room and getting a chance to watch them this week.”
While Helton emphasizes a bend-but-don’t-break attitude for the defense, he also expects the offense to pick the defense up and score points of their own.
“We focused a lot on our red zone game plan and what I think is really going to be the most important aspect of the game,” Helton said. “Any time you deal with a team that scores 43 points, you better be scoring points of your own.”
Without senior running back Justin Davis, who Helton said was doubtful for Thursday’s game, the brunt of the run game will fall to sophomore Ronald Jones II. Cal’s defense gives up an average of 270 rushing yards per game, and Jones is looking to take advantage.
“We’ll have to pick up the load,” Jones said. “We don’t really look too much into rankings, we’re just going to go out there and do what we do.”
Playing without Davis two weeks ago when the Trojans faced Arizona, both Jones and fellow running back sophomore Aca’Cedric Ware heavily influenced the game, with Ware rushing for a career-high 103 yards.
“The teams that have struggled against Cal are the ones that have gone three-and-out and three-and-out in a hurry,” Helton said. “When you are playing a team that puts up big drives, you have to sustain your own drives, have ball control and make those third downs.”
USC is 26-11-3 all-time in Thursday games, but will face a staunch challenge this week if they hope to keep their unblemished home record this season. Thursday’s game kicks off at 7:30 p.m. and will be televised on ESPN.

Around this time last year, after laying around in my pajamas all day struggling to conceptualize a creative Halloween costume, the idea suddenly came to me. Inspired by the grunge scene of veganism, I decided to take an ethical stand for the environment and animals by dressing up as a goth vegan.
The construction of the costume was fortuitously easy. As a colorful person who fittingly wears colorful clothing, I was surprised at the amount of black in my closet. I threw on a black long sleeve crop top, a black skater skirt, black tights, black knee-high socks and black wedges.
I then made a quick run to Rite-Aid (in my pajamas) and purchased the fairest foundation I could find and a thick jet black eyeliner crayon, both animal product-free and cruelty-free. (An article to come on shopping for cruelty-free beauty products).
After caking my face in foundation six shades too light for my skin tone, I accentuated my dark, bushy eyebrows with layers of black eyeliner and covered my lips with the jet black eyeliner crayon, since Rite-Aid was sold out of black lipstick.
Now for the vegan touches. To strike a plant-based theme, I incorporated green into my makeup. I added glittery-green eyeshadow on top of my black lips, shaded my eyes with green eyeshadow and wore green contacts that I unexpectedly found in the back of my cabinet that my sister had snagged from her job at an eyecare store months prior. I headed to my kitchen for the final and essential piece to completing my character: a fresh leaf of kale.
Sometimes vegans get unfavorable reputations for being too adamant about their beliefs, constantly pushing their veganism onto people and protesting that “meat is murder.” As someone who once never imagined becoming a vegetarian, let alone a vegan, I understand that negative perception.
However, belittling someone for professing their beliefs about a cause they care about and that you may not agree with is unfair. Vegans have reason to be passionate for the incessant raise and slaughter of animals and destruction of the environment as a result thereof.
Additionally, the multitude of benefits of veganism — environmental, ethical, health, wellness — that can entirely alter one’s life and perception of the world, make the lifestyle even harder not to share with others. When you deeply care about something, whether that be climate change, sweatshops fitness or music, it’s really difficult not to share and advocate your passion with others and consider solutions to solving the problem at hand (if applicable).
When I arrived at the party scene, people would immediately recognize that I was goth, but would shortly after scrunch their faces at the indistinguishable piece of wilted kale in my hand. “What is that?” they would ask. Then I would begin my schpiel.
Well, I’m not only goth, I’m a goth vegan. As a vegan myself, I’m spreading the message that vegans have reason to be doomy and gloomy about our eco-crisis. My explanation would usually strike the inquisitor’s curiosity and segue into an intriguing discussion about veganism. Other times, the other person would gawk and walk away, as is understandable when conversing with intoxicated party-goers. Then again, it was easier to reach out to others about veganism when they were more easygoing than usual.
So Trojans, I encourage you to dress up for a cause you care about this Halloween. In the realm of veganism, maybe you’ll consider dressing as a piece of meat, with dashed lines across sections of your body labeled with “breast,” “leg” and “thigh,” an extra firm piece of tofu, an evil Ronald McDonald with blood-drenched hands or an angry chicken who has been targeted by the “eat mor chikin” Chick-fil-A campaign. Whatever your passion is, your authentic self is sure to shine through and inspire hope in others.

America’s first dog cafe is hosting its own spooky celebration during Halloween weekend. The event, called Coffee Cups and Costumed Pups, will begin on Saturday and continue until 7 p.m. Sunday at The Dog Cafe in Los Angeles. Guests will be able to interact with the cafe’s dogs in costume, while enjoying Halloween-themed drinks and goodies.
Photo from Dog Cafe LAIt’s a ruff life · No terror, just terriers! This Halloween weekend The Dog Cafe will have costumed pups and coffee cups for guests looking to have a spectacularly spooky time with Halloween-themed goodies.
The Dog Cafe opened its doors in early April of this year just south of Silver Lake, located inside a quaint strip mall. Since its soft opening, the cafe has gained national attention as the first  official dog cafe with a goal to revolutionize the dog adoption process.
Guests will be able to grab a cup of coffee or tea before settling in to lounge with the cafe’s canines. The cafe encourages personal interaction between individuals and rescue dogs with the hope that guests will open their hearts to adopting these canines into their home. The Dog Cafe’s website features over 15 pups currently seeking adoption. From puppies to adult canines, these furry friends hope to make a good impression on their potential owners.
For its Halloweekend event, The Dog Cafe will create a festive environment by putting its puppies in costume and offering special photo opportunities and costume contests. Guests are not required to wear a costume, but the cafe encourages animal-themed apparel for this celebration. Instead of bringing home a memorable photo with a pup, puppy-loving guests are able to inquire about adoption at the center.
As its first-ever Halloween celebration, the cafe intends to create a unique Halloween experience for all attendees through exclusive drinks and goods available only during the event. Its Facebook page hints at a special pumpkin spice latte drink alongside other surprises, like dog treats given to guests to hand out.
In addition to these seasonal goods, guests are also able to enjoy a variety of simple teas, coffees and lemonade from the normal cafe menu. The cafe does not serve food as a precautionary protection for its canines, but it serves drinks from brands like Grounds and Hounds Coffee Co. and Dogs Drink Coffee, which donate a portion of their proceeds to animal-friendly causes.
The Dog Cafe is open from 11 a.m. to 7 p.m. for both walk-ins and reservations, but for this special occasion, online reservations are highly encouraged. There is a $10 online reservation fee for 55 minutes of playful interaction per guest.
The puppy-petting Halloween event welcomes all families with its kid-friendly atmosphere, but children under the age of 5 are unable to attend due to the cafe’s age policy. Unfortunately, guests are also not allowed to bring their own dogs, as the canines of the cafe may be sensitive or uncomfortable with outside dogs.
This Halloween weekend, the center promises “no fright, just delight,” with their 15 pup regulars present for playtime. Although these canines will be in costume for Halloween, The Dog Cafe aims to attract potential adopters through the seasonal event.  The dogs present in the cafe are usually those who have been in shelters the longest or at risk of being euthanized.
The cafe’s mission, besides providing a positive atmosphere for both dogs and humans to interact affectionately, is to find a caring home for their dogs. The center is also looking for volunteers who will be able to foster their rescues outside of business hours. These fosters will transport the canines to their homes after closing, provide for them a warm place to sleep and spend some quality relaxation time when they are not working at the cafe.
The Dog Cafe is located on 240 N. Virgil Ave. in Silver Lake. The cafe is open from Wednesday to Saturday from 11 a.m. to 7 p.m. weekly for lonely guests seeking a boost of caffeine accompanied by some canine friends.

Edible soil sounds like an unlikely concept. Though it is difficult  to imagine the existence of such an abnormal idea, Newton and Helen Mayer Harrison made it (and tasted it) back in 1970 as part of their performance art piece Making Earth. Roski M.A. candidates Karen Hinchcliffe, Rachel Keller and Carly Warhaft have video proof.
Photo courtesy of the Harrison StudioTalk dirty to me · In Making Earth, one of the eco-art projects featured in the exhibit, a husband-wife duo make fertile soil using organic ingredients. The soil is edible and is part of the performance art piece.
Dirty Talk, an interactive exhibit curated by three M.A. candidates in Roski’s Curatorial Practices and the Public Sphere program, discusses Los Angeles’ soil ecology.
Making Earth is one of the works featured in Dirty Talk, an exhibition that opens Thursday at the Gayle and Ed Roski MFA Gallery just off Figueroa Street. Hinchcliffe, Keller and Warhaft, students in USC’s curatorial practices and the public sphere program, curated the gallery together as their capstone project.
Dirty Talk carves out a unique space even within the niche of eco-art galleries. During their preliminary research, the curators were drawn to the generation of eco-artists that includes the Harrison duo, and they had an insight that gave them a focus for their exhibit.
“[The Harrisons are] categorized as environmental artists, but they’re actually coming out of a historical lineage of performance.” In Making Earth, the Harrisons mixed topsoil, manure and other organic ingredients together in order to make dirt that was naturally fertile  as well as edible. Tasting the final product was how they proved that the soil was healthy. But it was also a performative gesture, which invited the audience to consider how much they really knew about the chemistry of the soil their food grows in.
That’s a gesture that Hinchcliffe, Keller and Warhaft want to extend in Dirty Talk. In addition to commemorating Making Earth, and other historical eco-art projects by the Harrisons and conceptual artist Mel Chin, the Roski students have curated contemporary works in the same vein. All of the new pieces are by artists who live or have done extensive work in L.A., and all focus on local soil ecology. Their shared interest is in “shifting our understanding of Los Angeles as a place of nature,” as Keller put it.
Most importantly, every one of the works featured in Dirty Talk has an interactive or pedagogical component.
“We didn’t want it to just be a white box gallery show,” Keller said. “We hope that people come ready to engage, chat and talk critically about the works, and take things with them.”
For example, one work by the Commonstudio collective has visitors take home seed bombs – clay dolls peppered with hardy poppy seeds that can be planted in any soil. Another piece, a floor sculpture by Jenny Kane, contains a dozen samples of soil from different places in L.A. “How often do people walk on soil anymore?” Keller asked. “We’re hoping that people will take off their shoes and walk through this section of the gallery.”
Dirty Talk promises visitors an opportunity to physically engage with both the artwork presented and the issues the art takes on.
The curators are eager to make a difference with their gallery, not simply present the local history of eco-art.
“We talk a lot in the [MA] program about what we can do as curators,” Keller said. “What tools do we have that we can use in the cultural sphere to invoke or promote action or engagement in some way?”
The students’ retrospective approach is a forward-thinking curatorial strategy. Presenting historical eco-art performances by the Harrisons and Chin alongside contemporary pieces reminds visitors that environmental stewardship is a matter of legacy and tradition. When visitors leave the gallery, they’ll have something to take with them and ponder further. Keller suggested: “Take a seed bomb, and think about what it symbolizes.”
The gallery is located in the USC Graduate Fine Arts Building on 3001 S. Flower Street. Its hours are Wednesday through Saturday, 12 p.m. to 6 p.m. Following the opening reception on Thursday evening, the exhibit will be open until Nov. 20. Admission is free.

Educational institutions must meet the health care needs of their students, and the availability of wellness services, like counseling, is instrumental in providing this holistic care. Because college students are able to take their health into their own hands without needing parents as middlemen facilitating health care, students take advantage of the services available in large numbers. This semester, colleges across the country, such as Colorado State University, have introduced online counseling programs to meet the high student demand of wellness services on campuses. These online tools seek to address student concerns on an easily accessible and readily available platform. Though the integration of technology and wellness services seems like natural progression as digital platforms become more and more a part of our daily lives, the efficacy of such programs is difficult to determine.
Emilie Skoog | Daily Trojan
It is crucial to address the demand for student counseling services. However, USC should look to evaluate flaws in its current program and make changes to improve its efficacy before implementing online counseling, which would be an entirely new program. If online counseling is adopted, these services should not be considered replacements for in-person counseling, but rather supplementary when needed.
Because online counseling services are a recent development, there is little research proving the impact of such programs. While they have been proven beneficial for common anxiety, there is concern when these issues are consulted for more serious issues, like depression and suicidal thoughts. An issue with online programs is their inability to intervene in a pressing crisis situation. Because students can often remain completely anonymous when seeking online services, this prevent scounselors from providing the immediate assistance a situation might require.
Despite the potential drawbacks of online counseling services, it does provide an outlet for students who do not feel comfortable meeting with a counselor for help in person or talking on the phone. It caters to this niche of people who have not sought help and feel more comfortable using this digital platform.
So, while meeting student demand for wellness programs is imperative, introducing online counseling services is not a perfect solution to this problem. Instead, USC should look to address complaints about existing wellness programs and improve these before integrating a new program.
One issue with the current wellness programs on campus is its failure to meet immediate need for student services. When scheduling appointments, the online portal provides the phone number of a 24/7 on-call counselor for immediate assistance in a crisis situation. However, counselors are not as easily accessible otherwise.
It is not an option to directly schedule a individual counseling appointment. First, students must schedule a consultation with a counselor, which is a brief phone conversation in which the counselor evaluates a student’s situation and provides recommendations for next steps. A huge problem in scheduling these appointments is that times are limited and students must schedule weeks in advance for just this phone call, meaning that further steps in addressing student needs will not be taken for even longer than that.
Even after completing a phone consultation, students are not guaranteed an individual counseling appointment. Rather, they could simply be referred to a group therapy session or directed to another USC office for services. USC should make individual therapy more available to students, whether by expanding staff or daily operation hours or locations where wellness services are available. USC should not add new programs before addressing flaws in the current ones. There is no guarantee that the online services will be effective if the existing resources are not adequately meeting student needs.
Additionally, when considering implementation of an online program, USC should be careful to hire the same quality professional staff that work in the wellness center. Increasing demand should not equate a decrease in quality of services.
In theory, the existing wellness programs at USC are doing their jobs. They are comprehensive options for students seeking help with a wide range of problems. To keep pace with the growing emphasis and concern for student mental and emotional health, USC should imcrease the access students have to these resources. While an online counseling program may prove beneficial in the future, it should never be considered as a replacement for other services the wellness center provides.

Over the past year, Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump has made no shortage of ridiculous statements. With a history of sexually lewd (and just generally absurd) comments, some may argue that the extent of Trump’s head-turning diatribes extends far beyond the recent election cycle. From the infamous “wall” to his characterization of  Clinton as a “nasty woman,” Trump has captured our nation’s attention time and time again as we continue to ask ourselves how this man has managed to become a presidential candidate. Few of Trump’s outlandish remarks, however, have stumped viewers quite like his forecast that he may not concede following November’s election decision. Speaking from a podium to a roaring GOP crowd in Ohio just after the third debate, the former reality TV host said, “I would like to promise and pledge, to all of my voters and supporters and to all of the people of the United States, that I will totally accept the results of this great and historic presidential election — if I win.”
Rachel Atherly | Daily Trojan
To many people, Trump’s remark may seem like nothing more than one of the many pathetic cries for publicity that have become characteristic of the candidate’s campaign. Unfortunately, this isn’t the case. Trump is saying that, if he loses (which according to most major political analysts is extremely likely), he will refuse to accept defeat. It’s no secret that the Donald is a sore loser, but what does this actually mean for American politics?
Trump’s potential “refusal” of the electoral decision is a threat to American democracy. Our political system, at its core, is firmly rooted in the idea that the American people will vote and choose someone to be their leader. The winner steps into power, and the loser accepts defeat. Trump is challenging the idea of a peaceful transfer of power and subsequently encouraging his supporters to refuse to submit to anyone else becoming president.
The real danger of Trump’s rejection of the political system is the possible manifestations of his supporters’ anger. Rather than accepting the results of the election, Trump is pushing his most fervent supporters to rebel. Many of those trying to “make America great again” will follow his lead and refuse to admit that their candidate was defeated. Instead, fervor could take the form of violence, riots or attacks on one of the many minority groups that Trump has managed to offend and alienate.
Beyond potential violence, Trump is delegitimizing the American electoral process and setting an example that it is not necessary for one to follow the rules. This idea — one of turning democratic politics on its head — is detrimental. By refusing to concede, Trump will set the stage for insurrection and chaos. In a time when political stability and cooperation are of utmost importance, Trump’s remark is far more than a controversial stunt to maintain the spotlight. Trump’s words are a threat — a threat to politics, a threat to peace and a threat to America as we know it.
Donald Trump isn’t trying to make America great again. He’s attempting to make America take a step back. He is advocating for an America where progress and democracy are left behind in favor of defiance and hostility.
Michelle Obama said it best: “I know it’s a campaign, but this isn’t about politics. It’s about basic human decency. It’s about right and wrong. And we simply cannot endure this, or expose our children to this any longer — not for another minute, and let alone for four years. Now is the time for all of us to stand up and say enough is enough. This has got to stop right now.”
Since when does the Left have a problem with rebellion?  They invented rebellion in America.  For starters, look back at the 60s and early 70s…..free speech movement, war moratoriums, the 68 election/Chicago 7, et al.  The Left seems to have issues with another group taking the banner.

While this year’s presidential debates have provided plenty of fodder for memes and late night skits, it was the third and final debate that seemed to create the largest trend the fastest. In fact, Forbes claims that an entire economy was created: “The Nasty Woman Economy.” From “wrong” to “no, you’re the puppet,” Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump has not shied away from interruptions during the three presidential debates. However, it was those four words — “such a nasty woman” — that resonated with people, particularly women, across the country. “Weird Al” Yankovic made a parody song about this particular phrase as well as Trump’s “bad hombres” comment. Clothing retailer Nasty Gal changed their website’s title to Nasty Woman. The domain “Nasty Women Get S—t Done” now redirects to Hillary Clinton’s campaign site. Any quick browse through Etsy will turn up hundreds of items for purchase —  there are “nasty woman” pillows, t-shirts, totes, necklaces, pillow, prints, pins and more.
After sexual assault accusations against Trump stacked up, and made during the same debate in which he used the phrase “bad hombres,” the nasty woman comment was not at all uniquely offensive, however, it was uniquely mobilizing. Nasty became a cultural touchstone overnight. In fact, Spotify’s official Twitter reported that streaming of Janet Jackson’s 1986 hit “Nasty” went up 250 percent the night of the debate. Not only did people resonate with the term, people began to sympathize with and relate to Clinton. In an interview with ABC News, Emily DiVito, a 23-year-old former supporter of Sen. Bernie Sanders, said the nasty woman comment created a “moment of connectivity” for her with Clinton.
Clinton, of course, is no stranger to sexist attacks. So it may come as a surprise to some that it took this particular insult toward women — particularly younger women — to relate to her. One of the dominant narratives during the primary season was that millennial women were voting for Sanders, not Clinton. In a USA TODAY/Rock the Vote Poll, millennial women were less likely than millennial men to support Clinton. Despite attempts to woo younger women by enlisting support from actresses like Lena Dunham and Ilana Glazer, millennial women still seemed apathetic about Clinton at best. And while nasty woman may not secure Clinton the young female vote, the insult, in conjunction with the infamous Trump tape, certainly marks a turning point.
Hillary Clinton remained composed when Trump called her a nasty woman. She hardly batted an eye. It was almost a sad moment: this accomplished, composed presidential candidate had to stand on stage while sexist insults were hurled at her. For every woman who has had to ignore a catcall or hold back tears after being called a derogatory name, this moment was surely a reminder that a woman’s position does not erase her vulnerability to this kind of attack.
Nasty is a particularly biting word. It evokes all kinds of stereotypes and toxic ideas about women. It manages to encompass both uncleanliness and immorality, while attempting to malign a woman for expressing her ideas. The power in reclaiming it then is equally powerful.
On the campaign trail for Clinton, Sen. Elizabeth Warren said, “Nasty Women are tough, nasty women are smart, and nasty women vote.” With the election just around the corner, the “nasty woman” vote will be an important component.

Freshman year is full of changes. You move away from home, you gain independence, you make new friends, etc. For me, freshman year was the best year of my life. I lived in New North, and while there were a few drawbacks to living in that dorm, I couldn’t have asked for a better living situation. I was fortunate enough to meet and befriend people that I know will be a part of my life forever. New North was a place full of constant laughs and chaos. There was always something to do and someone willing to do it with you. It was where I belonged. The nine months that I was able to live in that dorm all blended together as one. Then, May came around, and I emotionally packed up my dorm and moved home for the summer.
I expected sophomore year to be a continuation of last year. The apartment complex, West 27th Place, had a very similar reputation to that of New North. It was known as the “social” apartment complex for sophomores, just like New North was the “social” dorm for freshmen. Immediately upon moving in, I knew that sophomore year would be fun. What I didn’t account for was how different it would be in comparison to freshman year.
The first difference that I noticed was the so-called “door policy.” In New North — or at least in my hall in New North — everyone left their doors open at all times. You couldn’t walk through the hall without hearing your name being called from multiple rooms or running into at least five people that you knew. Apartments are a little different. There is no such thing as the “open door policy.” This isn’t necessarily a drawback; In fact, many people would probably consider this to be a positive thing. It is a lot quieter and you do have much more privacy. However, I am a fan of constant interaction and noise. I miss the loudness of my freshman dorm.
As November approaches, I am better able to reflect on my transition from freshman to sophomore year. In terms of housing, I have noticed that living in an apartment is much less social than living in dorms. To be completely honest, I don’t think I’ve even met all of my immediate neighbors.
Outside of housing, things have pretty much stayed the same. I still love my friends, my classes and USC as a whole. My friendships continue to grow stronger along with my USC pride. Since everything is no longer new, I also have more time to explore L.A. Additionally, I am less homesick than I was last year. Overall, sophomore year is neither better nor worse than freshman year; It’s just different.

If you’re one of the thousands of fall admits at USC and you’re still here, you deserve a pat on the back. You survived the first round of midterms and career fairs! 
I bet every international grad student would agree that the past few months seem to have gone by like a New York moment! Just when you thought you had finally trained your brain to stay awake for those wretchedly long class hours without pumping cringe-worthy amounts of caffeine into your system, or figured out how to keep up with deadlines and assignments week after week. And on top of that, doing your laundry, grocery shopping, cooking and still managing to stay upright — voila! Before you know it, you notice the midterm monster lurking right around the corner!
You realize you don’t have enough time left to finish all of that coursework you had been procrastinating on and gear up in time for the exams. And those of you like me — who are going back to college after a long stint at the industry — will probably understand the struggle to focus your attention on studying. All that staring at morsels of distraction flitting across your screens has actually left you with such a short attention span, even a goldfish can hold a thought for longer! But that’s the wonder of the human mind; it pulls up miracles when you need one! Whether you’re a “pull-all-nighters-at-Leavey” or “slog-in-your-own-private-space” kind of person, you just put your head down and do what you have to do to get yourself through the metaphoric “stormy night.”
For USC Viterbi students, the midterms are closely followed on heels by career fairs, and it’s time to start prepping your pitch to industries so you can land internships/full-time positions. My first experience with one was the USC Career Fair in September, which was anything but encouraging. Waiting for long hours under the relentless Californian sun to get a chance to speak to the recruiters seemed too daunting. You can’t hope to cover many booths — unless you are shameless enough to cut queues (which in my opinion is downright the most disdainful thing you could do)! Viterbi Career Fair was a little better from an engineering student’s perspective in that there are more companies and the crowd gets distributed. Also, you get really valuable insight as to what the industries expect from graduate students.
But as an international student in Viterbi, I find the career scene here to be very overwhelming. For one thing, the sheer population of engineering students at USC is H.U.G.E! So, competition is insanely high. On top of that, most international students have the burden of loans and VISA requirements to consider, which only adds to all the peer pressure. Moreover, from the time we start grad school, all we hear is advice like, “Start applying for internships early,” “It is not just about what you know, but more about who you know,” and the like. Most of this advice comes from good intentions, but sometimes I wonder if the real objective of getting a master’s degree is getting lost amidst all the mayhem!
For most people doing their master’s abroad, it isn’t just about getting a fancy degree and then a fancy job that will help them join the affluent ranks. It is about immersing themselves in the culture of a foreign land, gaining valuable experiences — technical or otherwise — and most importantly, gaining academic enrichment from the competitive environment that the school provides them. 
It is easy to get lost in the chaos, put learning in the back seat, and give in to peer pressure, but it takes incredible amounts of perseverance and resolution to utilize the opportunities correctly and channel yourself toward the path of self-improvement.
You are just incredible in writing the experience of an International student. It was so true in my case as well !! It just reminded me those days.
