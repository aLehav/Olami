At a certain point, there’s no sugarcoating what kind of program USC has become. 
Saturday’s 38-35 loss to Arizona State at the Coliseum that all but ended any hopes of USC repeating as Pac-12 champions was an indication of how far this program has slipped since the Pete Carroll era, how lowered expectations have turned into the norm and how much hotter head coach Clay Helton’s seat is becoming, game by game.
Here are three things that Saturday’s loss added to the accumulating list of horrors this season has produced thus far.
Home win streak snapped
No matter how disappointing USC has played this season, the one thing supporters have hung their hats on has been the win streak at the Coliseum. That was snapped on Saturday at 19 games, the second longest in college football. It was the first time Helton has lost in the Coliseum since taking over in 2015, the first time anyone on the team aside from the seniors has experienced a home defeat. 
There were tears flowing in the locker room. 
“When I see a grown man like [redshirt freshman defensive lineman] Jay Tufele being emotional because he gave everything he had and I see guys absolutely saddened by a loss, that’s what you want as a coach,” Helton said.
It eliminates a crutch for Helton and his backers. Despite the numerous lopsided road losses USC has experienced the past few seasons — including last week at Utah — they could always point to Helton’s success at the Coliseum, how this team has been unbeatable on home turf. 
But the streak was almost like a mirage, an easy excuse that did not atone for the problems that have become apparent. Perhaps it is fitting that it ended in the midst of a season that has put Helton’s job security increasingly at risk: He can no longer use the streak to prop himself up. 
Quarterback mistake?
One game is hardly enough a sample size, but one could make the case that USC could have started redshirt freshman Jack Sears instead of true freshman JT Daniels at quarterback in Week 1 and have a better record.
Sears looked rusty out of the gate, probably because he hadn’t played in a real game since high school. But he showed his skillset and flashes of Sam Darnold-esque greatness in the second half, helping USC rattle off 21 straight points to flip a 24-7 deficit. 
He completed 20-of-28 passes for two touchdowns and 235 yards, didn’t throw a pick and looked more comfortable than Daniels has all season. 
Sears has a stronger arm than Daniels, more athletic ability and — unlike the true freshman — the wherewithal to extend plays with his feet, to make something out of nothing. That is a valuable asset, especially in an offense run by Helton and offensive coordinator Tee Martin that is too often stagnant and predictable. 
Let’s not forget that for the hype surrounding Daniels this season, Sears was the sixth-ranked dual threat quarterback recruit in the country before he committed to USC, according to Rivals — one spot below Texas quarterback Sam Ehlinger.
And yet, not only did Helton choose an 18-year-old to lead the program, but he also dropped Sears to third in the depth chart behind redshirt sophomore Matt Fink despite the fact that Sears clearly has more talent. 
Whether it was seniority, giving into the hype or a combination of both, Helton did not make the right call regarding Sears, who looks like starter material to me — and, apparently, to Helton. 
“[He] practices like a starter, and today he played like a starter,” Helton said after Saturday’s game. 
The head honcho will have a decision to make next week, should Daniels heal from his concussion. Two seasons ago, Helton essentially admitted he made the wrong decision to start Max Browne over Darnold when he made the switch following a 1-3 start. Will this season make it 0-for-2 in quarterback decisions? 
Apathy
The only thing worse than a home win streak being snapped and a potential quarterback decision brewing is having nobody care about either, and that’s the direction this season appears to be turning in.
USC drew just 47,406 fans on Saturday at the Coliseum, the lowest for a home game since 2001, and it is on pace to draw the fewest fans per game since 1987. 
Camera shots from above the Coliseum on Saturday revealed many patches of empty seats. Nobody wants to watch a .500 team, especially in Los Angeles, when the weekend weather is picture perfect and there are better sports teams in the immediate vicinity. 
But that is what USC has become, a “meh” program when the expectations and history demand so much more. It has become a program that is not worth spending a Saturday to watch anymore. It has become just another mediocre Pac-12 team when it should have the talent and resources to compete for a national championship. To not even be surprised in the slightest after a home loss to Arizona State shows you all you need to know about the state of this program. 
And as the losses continue to pile up, as the home-win streak becomes a thing of the past and as the coaching staff faces mounting criticism, the pressure to make a change at the top may reach a boiling point sooner rather than later.

Sophomore midfielder Savannah DeMelo posted four shots against Utah despite not scoring, bringing her season tally up to 61. (Emily Smith | Daily Trojan)
The women’s soccer team was unable to come out with a victory in Utah Sunday after two overtime periods. The game ended in a 0-0 tie.
Both teams came off tough matches against ranked opponents midweek, as the Trojans took on Colorado and the Utes played UCLA on Thursday. 
While the game lacked intensity, both teams had decisive opportunities at scoring, but could not put the ball in the back of the net. 
Utah had a good chance to score at the beginning of the second half, their play forced USC redshirt sophomore goalkeeper Kaylie Collins to make a double save to prevent the Utes from getting on the board. Right after that play, Utah hit the crossbar from a corner kick that almost caught the Trojans by surprise.
The Utes proved to be a threat on set pieces, but were unable to convert any of their dangerous chances. 
“They surprised us with a little formation change, the good coaches they are did something different, so that was nice,” head coach Keidane McAlpine said. “It took us a little while to figure out where the spaces were because of that, we were a little hesitant in running. We just didn’t go when we had the opportunities to go and we didn’t slip the balls in the gaps that we had.”
The Trojans looked uncharacteristically shaky while defending corners, and often left Utes players open to get a head on the ball. Collins was able to get in the way to stop every opportunity she faced.
However, the Trojans looked as though they were the more likely team to score once they got settled in the second half. 
Senior forward Leah Pruitt was fouled in the box and the Women of Troy were awarded a penalty in the 59th minute of the game. Senior defender Ally Prisock, who scored her last penalty attempt against Arizona, hit it low to the keeper’s right, but it was not far enough away from Utah junior goalkeeper Carly Nelson, who made a great save. 
Soon after, redshirt sophomore midfielder Savannah DeMelo had a good opportunity on goal and hit the post from a left-footed shot from inside the box in the 60th minute of the game. 
DeMelo was the team’s brightest player Sunday, and was involved in most opportunities the Trojans created despite being double-teamed throughout the game. 
In the 82nd minute, junior left back Julia Bingham came close to scoring. She dribbled down the left hand side through two defenders and forced the keeper to make a tough save. That opportunity was one of the best in the game for the Trojans, aside from the penalty kick.
Within the first couple of minutes of overtime, it appeared that the Trojans were the more likely team to score; however, much like the rest of the game, they were unable to convert any of their chances on goal.
In the second period of overtime, Utah was inches away from winning the game off of a nice cross, but they just missed wide of the goal which ensured both teams coming out of the game with a draw.
USC is now 15-1-2 on the year as it prepares to take on UCLA at StubHub Center on Friday in its final game of the regular season.

Starring “Grey’s Anatomy” actors Justin Bruening and Sarah Drew, “Indivisible” explores a couple’s efforts to save their marriage in the midst of war. The film was released in theatres on Friday. (Photo from IMDb)
In “Indivisible,” “Grey’s Anatomy” alumni Sarah Drew and Justin Bruening return to the screen with palpable chemistry. 
However, even spectacular performances from Drew, Bruening and the rest of the cast weren’t enough to save a lackluster script and sloppy cinematography. 
Based on the true story of Army Chaplain Darren Turner and his wife Heather Turner, “Indivisible” follows the Turners after Darren’s deployment to Iraq in 2007 and the fallout of his time abroad. 
“Indivisible” touches on the topics of post-traumatic stress disorder, war and relationships through the lens of faith. 
Drew performs beautifully — her facial expressions are effusive and reactive to every situation. The audience can feel the pain in her voice when Heather screams, “I need you!” during a fight with Darren. The anguish on her face and the breaking of her voice reveal the immense pressure Drew’s character deals with while raising three children by herself and supporting various army widows. 
“Indivisible” touches on the importance of communication to sustain healthy relationships and healing, both in everyday life and in war. However, at certain points, the characters’ long, drawn-out monologues can feel like characters preaching at the audience. In fact, many of the plot points seem predicated on long monologues.
In one scene, fellow soldier Michael Lewis (Jason Winston-George) runs into Darren, who works at a gardening business after returning from Iraq. Michael, who had been previously disillusioned with the idea of God, lost his leg during an attack in Iraq and became a believer afterward. However, his interaction with Darren seems overtly staged and inauthentic, as the two had not spoken since Iraq. 
The film contains some questionable directing and cinematographic choices. The decision to have some of Darren’s sermons put on voiceover was questionable at best, as these scenes could have easily seen Turner interact with the crowd at the Iraqi army base. 
The cinematography of the scenes in Iraq is lackluster. While the movie focused more on themes of faith and communication, it lacked the grittiness of typical war movies which would have provided more context as to Darren’s symptoms from PTSD. Instead, the film’s adrenaline-triggering war scenes feel distant and removed — especially when the soldiers go on patrol only to see Darren finding out about their deaths in the next scene. 
“Indivisible” is a solid independent film with impressive performances from the cast. Its approach to war and PTSD go against the grain of typical war films. While “Indivisible” is probably more appealing to people of faith, its unifying theme of communication is understood by all.

Dariel Filomeno | Daily Trojan
People often dress up as witches for Halloween. It’s a convenient, easily recognized costume. Yet there was a time when being a witch resulted in death by hanging. 
These witches were often women who were different from their neighbors and murdered for being themselves. Today an untraditional, “weird” woman isn’t killed for being different, but there are consequences to standing out.  
In music, one such trailblazer who refused to blend in is Stevie Nicks. As a part of Fleetwood Mac, Nicks is a classic rock icon whose influence can be found anywhere you look. Her prominence began when she wrote the song “Rhiannon” for the band in 1975. 
Nicks found the name “Rhiannon” in a book and decided it would sound pretty in a song. Not long after, she discovered it was also the name of a Celtic deity and ran with it. 
On the surface, the song is a portrait of a mysterious woman who captivates the hearts of men. However, the lyrics took on a more magical connotation after she started introducing its connection to the witch-goddess at shows.
“She is like a cat in the dark and then she is the darkness,” Nicks sings, painting a picture of the powerful and mystical Rhiannon.
The song is one of Fleetwood Mac’s biggest hits, and a signature of Nicks’ discography. 
When I first heard the band’s self-titled album, the song instantly became one of my favorites. Nicks is irrepressible as she unleashes her voice on the track with unrestrained conviction. The hazy production swirling around her voice adds to the spooky atmosphere. Today, it’s still a haunting track that no one else could have pulled off, one that immediately turned me into a Stevie Nicks fan. 
Historically, rock has been a male-dominated genre. When Fleetwood Mac was at the height of its power, many fans and critics had a hard time reconciling Nicks’ talent with the perceptions propagated by the patriarchal music sphere she belonged to. As a result, the blowback against her gained traction. When her debut solo album “Bella Donna” came out, rock critic Lester Bangs wrote a review titled “Stevie Nicks: Lilith or Bimbo,” in which he points out that two different hair stylists were each credited for the front and back covers “and it damn sure looks like the same haircut.” 
If Nicks was a man, would he have spent an entire paragraph dissecting her “narcissistic” album cover in a piece supposedly about her music? In a review of “Rumors” for Rolling Stone, John Swenson notes that Nicks gives the only lacking vocal performance on “Dreams,” which he describes as “lightweight.” It’s also the only number one song on the Billboard Hot 100 that Fleetwood Mac has ever produced.
Some went further than simply diminishing her artistic talent by attacking Nicks herself. A rumor spread in the ’80s that Nicks was a witch because of her lyrics and flowy black dresses. In reality, Nicks was a woman who fully embraced her femininity. 
To some in the music world, being unabashedly feminine counted as criminal offense, and a woman who could not be stifled or controlled by the rules her male peers created was dangerous. 
The only way to bring her down was to launch a literal witch hunt.
Unfortunately, much of the pressure Nicks went through to establish herself as a legitimate star haven’t vanished. We see it in the workplace, where men still outearn women for equal work. We see it in politics, where female voices are stifled in favor of the careers of male counterparts. In music, it’s found in the disparity of mainstream female rappers and country singers or in the way we hone in on female performers’ appearances. 
To be seen as someone worthy of commercial attention, a woman has to be both talented and infallible. Any signs of imperfection can be used to erase her accomplishments in the blink of an eye. 
However, we rise to the challenge over and over. It is a daunting one that can feel impossible, but we do it anyway. 
Women like Nicks who refuse to give in to the cruelty of a rigged system make it possible for more like her to follow in suit. She’s paved the way for artists like Beyoncé, Lady Gaga, Lana Del Rey, Florence Welch and countless others who look to her for inspiration. 
By refusing to compromise, she gave future generations of women permission to be themselves and showed them how it’s done. While the world has a long way to go before female artists escape the scrutiny not afforded to their male peers, the path forward is that much easier because of Nicks’ actions.
In 2013, Nicks guest starred on an episode of “American Horror Story: Coven,” playing herself as a witch. Decades after the “witch” rumor was thrown around as a way to discredit her, Nicks took that label and made it her own. Being a witch means exuding power. 
Being a witch means being uncontained. And being a witch means having control over one’s own image no matter what.

Rapper Denzel Curry performs at The Novo for the L.A. stop of his “TA13OO” tour. Despite strict venue security, the crowd matched Curry’s chaotic energy. (Matthew Philips | Daily Trojan)
Touring for his latest album “TA13OO” (pronounced “taboo”), Florida rapper Denzel Curry delivered an aggressive and dynamic show at The Novo Friday night — his brand of cloud trap featured impeccable flows and clever lyricism.
KiD TRUNKS opened for Curry, playing songs like “IDK” and “Love Never Blossoms” while also showing appreciation for those in attendance by showering the crowd with water bottles. 
To close his set, Kid Trunks paid tribute to former mentor rapper XXXTentacion by playing his song “SAD!” accompanied by footage of the  late South Florida rapper performing. 
At this time, many fans tried to enter the pit. However, The Novo’s tight security presence prevented chaos-seekers from doing so by only admitting firstcomers with special wristbands. 
Despite the strict security hindering entries to the pit, many decided to hop the barriers. The barrier-hoppers served as a testament to the thrill and mayhem of Curry’s music and arguably further enhanced the experience.
Curry’s performance was broken up into three acts analogous to  the three-act concept found on “TA13OO.” For the first act titled “Light,” Curry performed songs that had bouncier production and lighter subject material such as “TABOO | TA13OO,” “BLACK BALLOONS | 13LACK 13ALLOONZ” and “CASH MANIAC | CAZH MAN1AC.” 
Curry’s set also included his older material, such as “Parents,” off his 2013 mixtape “Nostalgic 64.” 
During this act, Curry presented visuals of pink cats, still clouds and eerie pictures of him smiling. As the show progressed into the acts of “Gray” and “Dark,” Curry’s visuals and music followed suit.
For his second act titled “Gray,” Curry performed heavier hitting songs with a darker visual transition. Scenes of Curry locked behind bars seemed to be an ode to Hannibal Lecter as Curry also donned the same mask in the visuals. At this time, Curry played songs such as “Sumo | ZUMO,” “CLOUT COBAIN | CLOUT CO13A1N” and “SWITCH IT UP | ZWITCH 1T UP” from “TA13OO,” along with “G**k” and “ULT” from his 2016 album “Imperial.” With the darker visuals and heavier production, Curry’s aggressive delivery of each verse was intense and well received by the crowd. It not only demonstrated Curry’s flow and lyrical prowess, but also his energy as a performer. 
Curry’s third act, “Dark,” paired Curry’s most aggressive and heaviest songs with visuals of a twisted carnival, axe-wielding clowns and a bloodied Curry morphing into a twisted mime. 
In this final act, Curry let his hair down, took off his shoes and pumped up the crowd for the finale. Curry’s final act was a wall of death, as audience members in the pit split themselves into two opposing sides and charged at one another when Curry gave the cue.
As the third act started to wane, Curry continued the tribute to XXXTentacion by performing two of his biggest hits: “Look At Me!” and “#ImSippinTeaInYoHood.” Despite the controversy surrounding the allegations against the late rapper of domestic abuse, most of the audience took part in respecting Curry’s tribute.
Curry quieted the crowd one last time and, to audible excitement, broke down into a dance from Fortnite before walking out. He showed love to his L.A. fans, commenting that his shows there are “always crazy.” If Friday night’s show was any indication, it’s only a matter of time before Curry returns to the city for another entertaining performance.

Non-Californians always seem shocked by the price of gas in Los Angeles, where paying above $4 per gallon is the norm. In states like Texas, gas can be as cheap as half of the L.A. price. But even though inflated gas prices can be burdensome, it is important to understand that taxes on gas are essential to maintaining the state’s infrastructure, and that the solution is not as straightforward as simply lowering prices. 
Last year, the California legislature faced similar questions. In 2017, the state Senate increased gasoline taxes and motor vehicle fees despite already high gas prices. Senate Bill 1 was intended to generate over $52 billion over the next 10 years dedicated to improving transportation infrastructure, such as bridges, freeways and public transport, all across California. 
SB1 placed a tax of $0.12 per gallon on gasoline and $0.20 per gallon on diesel. The bill also required a new license fee of $25 to $175 on all vehicles.
However, Proposition 6 on this year’s midterm ballot contains an initiative to repeal the gas tax and add a constitutional amendment requiring voter approval for any future increases in gas taxes. Voters should be wary. The proposition is not simply a quick fix to gas prices, and Californians should vote no if they care about their safety and the state’s infrastructure. 
Top California Republicans — including gubernatorial candidate John Cox — support Prop 6 in the hopes that it will boost Republican voter turnout in California. 
While advocates of Prop 6 believe it will ease the economic pressure on average Californians, the proposition would put an unnecessary burden on the state and be  detrimental to the its current infrastructure projects. 
There are approximate 6,500 road, bridge and highway projects currently underway in California, and passing Prop 6 would mean eliminating approximately $5 billion in funding to these projects, according to the California State Voter Guide. 
One of the biggest problems with the measure is that it eliminates existing funds; many unfinished infrastructure projects will lose their funding. 
There is a clear need for infrastructure improvements in the state — the California Voter Guide states that about 89 percent of counties in the state “have roads that are in ‘poor’ or ‘at-risk’ condition.” 
The uncertainty regarding the completion of infrastructure projects is concerning because many of them are necessary to meet earthquake safety standards. 
California Professional Firefighters, the California Association of Highway Patrolmen and the American Society of Civil Engineers areagainst Prop 6. A number of environmental groups also encourage Californians to reject the initiave, such as the Environmental Defense Fund, Sierra Club California and The Nature Conservancy.
Another important byproduct of Prop 6 is its potential to cause a significant loss of jobs. The California Chamber of Commerce has openly opposed Prop 6 because it found that the measure could eliminate 68,000 jobs in the construction industry and lead to a net loss of $183 billion in economic investments.
Most of those in favor of Prop 6 view the cost of living in California as too high, and hope that a reduction in the cost of gas will help lift the burden off low-income taxpayers in particular. 
But they fail to consider the hefty costs of not having the gas tax. Poor infrastructure, potholes and halted construction could significantly threaten the safety of California drivers. 
Providing quality transportation is critical not only for the health and well-being of voters, but also to the economy. 
Moreover, such an initiative takes away the responsibility and obligation of state lawmakers. If state leaders believe a tax increase is necessary for the funding of projects designed for the common good, adding an amendment that forces voters to have the final say is too risky. 
While the idea of cheaper gas is widely appealing, a gas tax is necessary for the safety, economics and infrastructure of California and its citizens. 
It is imperative that Californians vote no on Prop 6.

Artificial intelligence is ubiquitous. Siri and Alexa can scour the web for information, schedule appointments and play “Mo Bamba” for us on demand. Netflix analyzes our watch history to suggest shows to binge watch. And Amazon uses personalized ads to make billions of dollars off our shopping habits.
But machine learning’s sole purpose isn’t just to sell you that coffee maker you really don’t need. 
Recently, AI has taken on a new job: your therapist. As far as I’m concerned, this new technology is promising but should be approached with caution. 
Machine learning has woven itself into the fabric of our daily lives, providing us with services we never knew we needed. When it comes to seeking mental and emotional support, AI is revolutionary for its accessibility. 
As I’ve mentioned repeatedly in this column, a person cannot start getting better unless they have the resources to do so. And yes, some of the work must be done independently, but we all need a push in the right direction. Finding a professional suited to your needs, securing a means of transportation to the office and paying for that professional are all obstacles people need to overcome when finding mental or emotional treatment — and for many, those obstacles are insurmountable.
That’s where AI systems like Tess come into play. Created by tech start-up X2_AI, Tess is a mental health chatbot that provides temporary — and more importantly, affordable — support to those who may not have the time to find a therapist.  Users can message the chatbot when they’re having panic attacks or simply need to vent, and Tess will formulate responses based on the subject’s needs. 
Tess is a form of artificial intelligence, and one of its greatest assets is her ability to learn. It reacts to shifting information, analyzing speech patterns to make sure each patient is understood — if Tess is making any mistakes, users can simply tell it, and it will remember. And if Tess senses the situation requires more intervention than it is programmed for, it will connect users with real, human therapists.
Along with its availability, one of the biggest advantages of using AI in these situations is the anonymity of the service: When using chatbots like Tess, people can share their biggest secrets, their biggest traumas, with no fear of judgment from their audience. 
According to an NPR report, nearly 350 million people in the world suffer from depression, and most of them do not receive treatment simply because of the stigma surrounding the condition. When you remove the confrontational element of a therapist, you break down some of the fear of seeking help in the first place. 
AI can also catch symptoms and diagnose personalized treatment before people even realize a problem themselves. 
For example, researchers from Harvard University and the University of Vermont have used machine learning tools to improve depression screening: Employing color analysis tests and algorithmic face detection on Instagram photos, they correctly detected signs of depression 70 percent of the time. Furthermore, a 2016 study by the Suicide and Life-Threatening Behavior journal found that artificial intelligence and machine learning can identify a suicidal person with 93 percent accuracy.
That said, I can’t help but remain apprehensive about depending too heavily on AI, especially in more critical situations. 
There is a human element therapists provide that simply cannot be recreated by AIs. Therapists and psychiatrists are trained professionals; they know how people’s minds work because not only have they studied them for years, but they are also people themselves. On the other hand, an AI system — however sophisticated the technology may be — is strung together by fallible code. Brilliant code, yes, but code nonetheless. 
On the whole, if it isn’t worsening the conditions of people seeking help, I see no problem with embracing AI within the field of mental illness research and treatment. And while it may never recreate the experience of seeing a professional, AI creates yet another platform for people to find help — and take their first steps on the road to recovery.

CAVA in USC Village made sure employees had access to early voting, registration, polling hours and locations and can take a break from their shifts. (Sinead Chang | Daily Trojan)
One question that arises every election cycle is “How will workers have time to go to polls during work hours?” To address that concern, Mediterranean eatery CAVA is allowing its employees to take paid time off to cast their ballots. 
The new policy applies to all CAVA restaurants nationwide. Cindy Cornelio, a supervisor at the CAVA located at USC Village, said that the policy gives employees time to “use their voice.”
To ensure shifts can be moved around and extra employees can be called in time, participants requested for time off two weeks in advance. 
“Let’s say you’re working 8 a.m. to 4 p.m. …. and the polls close around 7 [or] 7:30 p.m.,” Cornelio said. “That person — if they requested the time off to be able to go vote — [has] two hours to go vote.”
USC Village CAVA’s general manager Brenda Yanez said employees were informed of the policy through an online module all workers are required to complete.
“[The class is] basically a disclaimer,” Yanez said. “It lets us know what the policy is and how much time and how to actually follow up with the employees that are going to be participating.”
Yanez said CAVA also made information on early voting, registration, polling hours and locations accessible to its staff.
“Everything that goes on with the company is communicated through what we call CAVA U,” Yanez said. “It’s available to all employees online. They can do it [in] their free time, while they’re at work. Any resources that they need [are] always available on CAVA U.”
Martin Renteria, who works at the USC Village CAVA, said many of the employees at USC have been particularly interested in Proposition 10, which would repeal a state law that restricts rent control policies.  
“That’s definitely one thing that everybody’s talking about,” Renteria said. “It’s a pretty hot issue.”
Renteria, who plans to use his paid time to vote Tuesday morning, said he is excited go to the polls. 
“I don’t think there’s ever been a time, at least that I can remember, where people were more excited to vote — or ready to vote,” Renteria said. 
Yanez said that at least 10 employees will be using paid time to vote, including herself. She said the policy is good for employees at the USC location. 
“We are a growing company and I think that it shows that we are actively participating within the community,” Yanez said.

Doctoral student Gina Loring created the petition after students made racially-charged comments in a class offered by the Rossier School. (Daily Trojan file photo)
A doctoral student at the Rossier School of Education created a petition that has garnered over 600 signatures as of Sunday asking the School to implement accountability practices after a classroom incident she described as racially-charged and offensive last month.
“‘Women of color should be ‘sterilized.’ — This profoundly racist statement was made in one of my classes and the instructor accommodated it, so I created a petition to generate accountability,” the petition written by student Gina Loring read.
Loring, who is a woman of color, said that while discussing ways to increase the number of women of color who receive prenatal care during an in-class assignment, some students suggested sterilizing women of color and taking their babies at birth would alleviate the issue.
“Imagine if the prompt had said, ‘How do we clean up the homeless problem in Los Angeles?’” Loring said. “And imagine if their suggestion had been, ‘We should round them up and shoot them because that would get rid of the homeless problem.’” 
Loring said she was stunned by the comments. She cited the history of eugenic sterilization and the current separations of immigrant families as reasons for her bewilderment. 
After the comments were written and quickly deleted, Loring said she told her professor Kim Hirabayashi, who assured her the comments would be addressed. 
According to Loring, the professor addressed the comments by encouraging a brief in-class conversation. 
“[The professor] then proceeded to open class with a vague statement about the incident, at no point addressing the comments directly,” the petition read. “The incident was thus not only left without resolution, it was magnified.”
Another student of color in the class said learning has been impacted because the majority of students in the “Challenges in Urban Education: Learning” class are people of color. 
Loring said six students reached out to her expressing discomfort with how the incident was handled, but did not feel comfortable speaking about it publicly.
Hirabayashi told the Daily Trojan in an email that she would not comment until a resolution has been finalized within the school.
Rossier Dean Karen Symms Gallagher said the school is aware of Loring’s petition and is currently reviewing the matter. 
“Our goal is to find an inclusive resolution that reflects both our commitment to an open exchange of ideas and our mission to teach students to value and respect the cultural history and the identities of those around them,” Gallagher wrote to the Daily Trojan. 
In the weeks following the incident, Loring filed a Title IX incident report and dropped the course from her record with a full refund, but said Rossier has not communicated with her since then.
Loring said she chose to attend USC, and specifically pursue a degree at the Rossier School because of its progressive mission statement, and said that she does not believe this situation reflects those values.  
Loring’s petition asks Rossier to publicly acknowledge the incident and implement workshops about critical race theory for Hirabayashi and the students involved. Loring and one of her classmates said they do not believe the students who made the comments are suited for the program. 
“I don’t see how USC could, in good conscience, send students out into the world with a doctorate degree in educational leadership who hold these kinds of beliefs or even would have these thoughts in the first place,” Loring said.
Loring said she viewed the incident as a microcosm of issues surrounding gender and race that persist in United States today. 
“We know from history that when unethical statements and unethical actions are left unchecked time and time again, it becomes worse and worse with time,” Loring said. “You end up with horrific things happening because the masses were quiet.”
Editor’s note: A correction was made to Loring’s quote “Imagine if the cops had said, ‘How do we clean up the homeless problem in Los Angeles?’” It has been updated to correctly reflect Loring’s statement.

Students lit candles at the beginning of the event to honor Shabbat and create Shalom bayit, peace in the house. (Photo courtesy of Joshua Zepeda)
Over 1,100 students gathered for Shabbat 1,000 Friday evening — the largest Jewish event in USC history — to celebrate the Sabbath, the Jewish day of rest, known as Shabbat in Hebrew. 
At the beginning of the event, attendees prayed at the Chabad house and walked to the Sigma Chi fraternity house for dinner. 
Shabbat takes place every week from Friday at sundown to Saturday evening, where Jewish people take the time to rest and be mindful of themselves and of the overall community. 
Although Chabad holds Shabbat dinners every week with an estimated 200 guests, Rabbi Dov Wagner said the organization hosts a large Shabbat event every year to encourage more people from the University to gather. Last year, around 700 students attended. 
“It is a great opportunity to enhance pride in identity, involvement and engagement,” Wagner said. “Especially to people who aren’t usually as involved, it’s a way of introducing the strengths of our community to the campus as a whole.” 
In light of Saturday’s shooting that caused the death of 11 people at a Pittsburgh synagogue, Wagner said he is grateful for the support and diversity at Shabbat Friday.
“There is so often hatred in our world,” Wagner said. “People are ashamed, embarrassed or scared to express who they are, to express their identity. Just getting to see so many people … celebrating, experiencing what the joy of a community is about.” 
During the dinner, guests and attendees participated in a candle lighting ceremony, prayed over wine and bread and listened to Wagner speak about Vayera, that week’s section of the Torah. 
“Looking around and seeing all my friends who were so happy to be there, I think that just really made the energy of the entire event so special,” said Chabad co-President Avia Cohen. “Everyone was having an amazing time, everyone was happy to be there. It was really something that I will never forget.” 
Albert Fishteyn, a sophomore majoring in music industry, said the dinner emphasized connectivity and togetherness. 
“It was a no judgement zone.,” Fishteyn said. “There was no fear of approaching people, you were more than welcome to approach people and talk to them.” 
Wagner also hopes students who attended Shabbat 1,000 learn to be prouder of their heritage. 
“We hope that they get a sense of pride in their own identity and the awareness that there is strong and vibrant Jewish life here at USC,” Wagner said. “We’re lucky to be at a university that welcomes diversity [and] that’s been very welcoming to our community. We’re proud of the opportunities to gather together and celebrate our heritage.”
