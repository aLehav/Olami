The following incidents were reported in the USC Dept. of Public Safety incident report summary between Wednesday, Apr. 3, and Thursday, Apr. 4. 
Miscellaneous incidents
at 1:50 P.M. on Apr. 3, DPS officers responded to a student report that someone claiming to be from Homeland Security contacted the student and asked him to wire money to another man in order to resolve a student visa issue. DPS investigated the incident and found it to be a scam. The student did not wire the money.
AT 12:18 P.M. on Apr. 3, DPS officers detained a student suspected of slapping and stabbing another student with a pen. The suspect was arrested after she was undentified by the other students involved. The stabbed student was transported to California Hospital for treatment.
At 5:18 P.M. on Apr. 3, DPS officers and LAFD responded to a fire alarm on the second floor of Troy Hall.  No fire was found, as the alarm had been set off by a cleaning product on a stove. The alarm was reset and the building was cleared by LAFD for re-entry.
At 10:26 P.M. on Apr. 4, DPS officers cited fraternity Alpha Tau Omega for disturbing the peace.  Members of the fraternity were running with lit torches, which created a safety hazard.
at 8:29 P.M. on Apr. 4, a DPS officer found a gum wrapper containing a white powdery substance and entered it into evidence at the UPC Public Safety Office.

Looks like dps has a lot of very important work going on these days! On top of confiscating a million bikes a day and making students sit and wait for 1 hour until they can get them back because they are on lunch break.
Running around with flaming white powder in gum wrappers is not a crime

For most students, events such as Springfest on Saturday seemingly run without a hitch and with the same success as previous years. However, the security policies implemented on Jan. 14 have made event planning more difficult, especially for smaller student-organized events such as KXSC Fest.
Electrofest · Students listen to Dan Deacon at KXSC Fest, which was held in the Ronald Tutor Campus Center Grand Ballroom. In past years, more than 2,500 students attended the annual festival held in Founder’s Park. — Razan Al Marzouqi | Daily Trojan
The new measures restrict access to the University Park Campus between 9 p.m. and 6 a.m. Additionally, student event applications now undergo stricter review by Student Affairs. As a result, on-campus events require heightened security in the form of additional fencing and Dept. of Public Safety personnel.
KXSC Fest 2013, which was held March 30 by the student-run independent radio station, was affected by the increased costs of on-campus event security.
Previously held in Founder’s Park, this year’s Fest took place within the Ronald Tutor Campus Center Ballroom and was open to students only.
“Last year, we had at one time about 2,500 people at Fest itself in front of the stage,” said the KXSC Promotions Director Malia Schilling.  “Peak attendance this year was between 400 and 500 — less than a quarter of what we had last year — which was disappointing but very reflective of the changes we had to deal with. It changed the way people interacted with KXSC Fest.”
The indoor location altered the festival’s former structure by eliminating the traditional outdoor atmosphere and requiring student ID verification upon entry. Unlike former years, the event was closed to non-students.
“There was no traffic with people walking by asking, ‘What’s that amazing thing in the park?’” said the KXSC Head of External Relations Annie Vought.
KXSC  hit the airwaves in 1975. Since 2009, it has held  an annual music festival in Founder’s Park.
According to an Undergraduate Student Government student programming security resolution, the new security measures were instated after the USG budget had been allocated. Because of this, student organizations must pay for the required security on their own.
Director of Performance Venues Brandon Operchuck said he recognizes the difficulties placed upon the school to ensure student safety and that DPS made an effort to work with KXSC.
“Our event, by the book, represents the most complicated type of event,” Operchuck said. “We were definitely overstaffed with DPS and CSC. Thankfully they cut down through the evening to save the station costs.”
USG representatives said they are also working to balance the payment responsibility for large on-campus events. KXSC General Manager Lee Robinson was grateful for USG’s support, though it did not keep the festival outdoors.
“It is USG’s job to help students, but with the increase in security, their same amount of funds isn’t enough to do so,” Lee said. “We have the same pot of money, but if everyone is grabbing more, then people are going to get left out.”
In the past, KXSC Fest has been open to the surrounding L.A. community. Last year, the event was featured in a calendar brief on Pitchfork.com, which generated publicity and led to a large turnout.
“In the past we’ve really loved being able to bring USC and the surrounding community together. And I think that’s been a great thing for us and a great thing for everyone who doesn’t go to USC but lives in the area,” Schilling said.
Voight said the increased security costs have placed a heavy burden on student-organized events.
“There’s a lack of transparency about these policies and what student groups are supposed to do in order to succeed despite them,” Vought said. “We understand the need for security, but to do so at the expense of countless student organizations’ successful events jeopardizes a lot of financial solvency and reputation.”
KXSC and its affiliates remain hopeful about future festivals. Lee emphasized the need to open lines of communication to further improve the funding and organization of on-campus, student-organized events. Schilling also expressed a desire for interaction with administration.
“We would love to be involved in the security measures and policies, especially as they pertain to us and our events, because we have knowledge of our organization and our events that DPS and the administration would find valuable,” Schilling said.

The award-winning student-run station Trojan Vision celebrated its 15th anniversary Saturday with a reception at the Robert Zemeckis Center for Digital Arts.
Crystal vision · Don Tillman, the executive director of Trojan Vision, speaks on Saturday to guests at the Trojan Vision anniversary dinner. – Ralf Cheung | Daily Trojan
Alumni gathered at the station’s off-campus headquarters to mingle, take tours of the building and see how the channel has evolved since its beginning in 1997.
Executive Director Don Tillman, who has been with the station since the very beginning, said the biggest change he has seen over the years is its constantly growing size.
The station began with only eight students. Now, the station boasts a staff of 250-300 students working on the show and producing content 24 hours a day, seven days a week.
As the station has expanded, so has its audience. According to Tillman, the station reaches at least 29,000 people on both university campuses. In addition, an hour and a half of programming is broadcast daily to the rest of the city on channel LA36, where it reaches more than 1.8 million homes, Tillman said. It also streams 24/7 on the station’s website.
Tillman said one of the most challenging, yet rewarding, aspects of the station is that programs are run exactly like they would be in the real world, giving students the opportunity to act as professionals would in the industry.
“Television operates on time every day come hell or high water, so it’s not something where you can say ‘Oh, I forgot to do my homework so I just won’t go to that class today,’” Tillman said. “Our people have to be here, they have to perform and they have to make it happen every single day.”
Andrea Martinez, a sophomore majoring in broadcast journalism, said working for Annenberg TV News has given her an invaluable opportunity to gain real-world experiences in the field she plans on pursuing after graduating.
“I’ve learned so much about how to put on a newscast from the assignment desk to actually being in studio,” Martinez said. “I’ve also had some quite terrifying experiences out in the field. I locked my keys in my trunk twice, have forgotten memory cards, gotten lost and stuck in traffic. It really throws you out there and gives you a feel for what real-life reporting is like.”
The channel features a wide range of programming including entertainment news such as The SCoop, cooking shows such as Delish, game shows such as Mind Games and talk shows that have featured guests such as Tom Hanks and Steven Spielberg.
Arianne Kalra, a sophomore majoring in neuroscience, said the wide variety of programs and guests she has encountered as a director and senior producer has been the most rewarding aspect of her job.
“The best part of my three semesters here has been the tons of interesting people I have been able to meet because of the show,” Kalra said. “They all come from different parts of the industry so it’s really fascinating getting to talk with them.”
Many students also said their involvement with the station has inspired their future career goals. Jonathan Fudem, an undeclared freshman, said his time with Trojan Vision has motivated him to consider pursuing a career related to media.
“It’s a fantastic organization and I really appreciate that they let the young people take charge of things and are open to new innovative suggestions,” Fudem said.

Oh. So if I went to channel 8.1 at 6:00pm Monday-Thursday, what would I see?

Oh. So what channel does ATVN air on?

Viterbi School of Engineering researchers presented their tool April 5 in Chicago that encrypts photos uploaded onto social networking sites like Facebook and Flickr, allowing users to keep their photos private.
Signal and Image Processing Professor Antonio Ortega, Computer Science Professor Ramesh Govindan and Moo-Ryong Ra, a doctorate student in computer science, created P3, which stands for Privacy-Preserving Photo Sharing. The U.S. National Science Foundation funded the research.
P3 is designed to encrypt and remove small amounts of data from photos, making them unrecognizable to cloud-based file sharing sites. Users, however, are able to share the encrypted version of the photo with others online without uploading the file to the website.
This technique also allows users to retain all rights to the photo. Many cloud-based file sharing sites, including Facebook, state in their terms of use that photos uploaded can be used by the website until the account is deleted. However, if the photo has been shared with other active users, the site still has license to use it.
“Nobody doubts the convenience of cloud-based sharing; the question is whether we can trust third parties to protect our photos from unauthorized distribution or use,” Ortega told USC News. “With P3, you decide how your photos can be used without losing the convenience of sharing them through the cloud.”
P3 does not hinder websites’ attempts to use photos uploaded by individuals, but instead scrambles the image the website can access so that it cannot be identified.
Ortega and Govindan will market P3, which has a provisional patent, to the public through a company set to launch this summer.
Erik Nelson, a senior majoring in business administration and Spanish, said the tool has the potential to be helpful, especially for security purposes.
”I think it’s great that there’s an option to keep personal photos truly private,” Nelson said. “You always hear that what goes on the Internet lasts forever, but I feel a lot better now being able to take photos of my friends and not have to worry about who can get access to it. I take a ton of pictures but I don’t want them to just be floating around on the Internet.”
And Sydney Goldman, a junior majoring in communication, said the tool can be helpful in light of constantly confusing and changing site policies.
“I’m glad that they are developing ways for me to be in charge of keeping my photos private rather than trusting Facebook to do so, especially because they continually change privacy policies,” Goldman said.

In a season where explosive offensive performances have become the norm, this was by no means a normal victory for the USC women’s water polo team. In fact, it was much sweeter, as No. 1 USC was able to stifle No. 7 UC Irvine for a grind-it-out 11-3 victory.
The Women of Troy took on the Anteaters on only one day’s rest following a victory over No. 11 Loyola Marymount on Thursday in what was to be the team’s only Thursday-Saturday test of the season. Though UCI was only 15-7 coming into the game, they were not to be overlooked. Eight of the Anteaters’ wins have come against ranked opponents, and six of their losses have been by three goals or less — five of them by only one goal.
USC came charging out of the gates, as juniors Kaleigh Gilchrist and Hannah Buckling combined for three goals in the first quarter. UCI was not to be denied, however, as they went on to score three unanswered goals of their own, the last one coming with 5:56 to play in the second period.
For the Anteaters, it would prove to be their last goal of the game.
The USC defense was strong in the second quarter, allowing only one goal on five UCI power play opportunities. This strong defensive showing paved the way for more USC goals, as senior Dominique Sardo started the USC run by hauling in a deft pass from freshman Anni Espar and putting it in the net at the other end to give the Women of Troy a 4-3 advantage.
After Sardo’s strike, junior Colleen O’Donnell scored from the perimeter to give the Women of Troy a two-goal lead. Soon after, sophomore sensation Eike Daube added a goal of her own to put USC up 6-3 going into halftime. For USC head coach Jovan Vavic’s team, this halftime lead was crucial to the team’s success.
“It was very important,” Vavic said of the early jump on UCI. “[The Anteaters] were only down one going into halftime against Stanford and were down to UCLA by only one goal going into the fourth. Those are the toughest teams, and they pushed both of them to the final quarter.”
Though the six first-half goals were important, arguably more important were the four 6-on-5 stops made by the USC defense in the second quarter. If there has been one area that this team has struggled in this season, it has been 6-on-5 defense but, on Saturday, the Women of Troy bore down to deny the Anteaters on most chances.
“We say that defense wins championships, and a key part of the defense is 6-on-5 opportunities,” Vavic said. “We spend a lot of time working on ours, and we had lots of good blocks today.”
After the midway break, USC’s offense came out a little sluggish, scoring only one goal in the third quarter on a Daube-to-Gilchrist strike. The defense, however, shut the Anteaters out in the frame, allowing the Women of Troy to take a 7-3 lead into the final quarter.
The USC squad would never look back, as seniors Chelsea Silvers and Constance Hiller and sophomore Monica Vavic each scored their first goal of the game. Buckling would add on another goal, completing the team’s only hat trick of the day. When the final horn sounded, the Women of Troy left Irvine with their 20th win of the season, topping the Anteaters 11-3.
The story of the day was the USC defense, which locked the Anteaters out of the net for the final 22 minutes of play, including the entire second half and most of the second quarter. Talented as UCI is, the Anteaters were simply not able to compete with the talent and determination of the top-ranked Women of Troy.
“UCI is a very young team,” Jovan Vavic said. “It was hard for them to come back emotionally. We were able to wear them down early and that’s part of our trademark.”
The Women of Troy will come home on Saturday for their first game at USC in nearly a month. The team will face off against No. 2 Stanford at 4 p.m. at the currently under-construction Uytengsu Aquatics Center.

The No. 4-ranked USC women’s sand volleyball team split another  pair of dual matches on Saturday in Malibu, falling to No. 1 Pepperdine, 5-0, before later defeating No. 5 Hawai’i, 3-2.
In their win over Hawai’i, the Women of Troy (10-5) notched early victories in the No. 3- and No. 5-ranked matches to start their day on a  positive note. USC sophomores Eve Ettinger and Bria Russ defeated Ali Longo and Karlee Riggs in straight sets 21-12, 21-15 at No. 3. Junior Brooke Fournier and sophomore Alexa Stonish would also take care of their business in straight sets, 21-19, 21-11, over Olivia Urban and Ku’ulei Zalopany at No. 5.
Hawai’i would not go down without a fight, as the Wahines (4-6) claimed wins at No. 2 and No. 4 to tie the match up at 2-2. In the No. 2-ranked match, USC senior Katie Fuller and sophomore Cinnamon Sary fell to Natasha Bell and Tai Manu-Olevao in three grueling sets, 22-20, 20-22, 15-10. At No. 4, junior Sam Hirschmann and senior Natasa Siljkovic fell in straight sets 22-20, 21-16 to Hawaii’s Ginger Long and Katie Spieler. The No. 1-ranked pair of junior Kirby Burnham and graduate student Stevi Robinson would save the day though, winning in straight sets 21-13, 21-11 over Jane Croson and Ashley Katl to clinch the match for the Women of Troy.
In the day’s opening team dual, USC could not keep up with the undefeated defending champion Pepperdine Waves, who swept every USC pair except Burnham and Robinson en route to a 5-0 shutout.
In their match, Burnham and Robinson dropped the first set to Lilla Frederick and Kim Hill 21-19 before coming back to win the second set 21-17. It would then be a battle in the third set with teams trading points back and fourth. The Waves finally broke USC’s serve to take the match 15-13.
At No. 2, Sary and Fuller fell to Lara Dykstra and Caitlin Racich in straight sets 21-12, 21-18.
USC, Pepperdine and Hawai’i also played a series of crossover matches, where different ranked pairs played against each other without team scoring on the line.
The result of these matches were very similar to the actual team duals, as the Waves once against shut out the Women of Troy. The only USC pair to emerge victorious comprised Burnham and Robinson, who defeated the No. 2-ranked Hawai’i pair of Bell and Manu-Olevao in straight sets 21-15, 22-20.
The No. 5-ranked pair of Fournier and Stonish would go to three sets with the No. 4-ranked Hawai’i pair of Longo and Riggs but would narrowly fall in the end.
With their win over Hawai’i, the Women of Troy completed a season sweep over the Wahines after beating them 5-0 earlier in the season. However, with its loss to Pepperdine, the USC came up winless for the season against Pepperdine after also losing to them 4-1 at Merle Norman Stadium on March 26.
The undefeated Waves have taken all but one game from the Women of Troy this season and USC will most likely not see them again until the USAV Invitational on April 20.
Next, USC will go on the road to Santa Barbara on April 13 for a pair of dual matches against Santa Barbara City College and Fullerton College. Times for the matches are to be announced.

The Trojans celebrated senior night at the Galen Center on Saturday as the USC men’s volleyball team prepared for its final home match of the season. While the team is characterized by its youth, seniors J.B. Green and Chris Trefzger were honored with a special ceremony before the game.

It was an auspicious start to the night, as both players were in USC’s starting lineup and helped guide the team to an upset sweep over No. 10 Cal State Northridge.
Saturday’s match followed a disappointing performance on Thursday against Long Beach State. Ranked No. 2 in the nation, Long Beach State (21-7) outplayed the Trojans (6-16) in nearly every way and swept the match 25-17, 25-17, 25-17.
Sophomore outside hitter Joey Booth led the Trojans with 10 kills but the rest of the team was badly outserved. Though there was not much hope before, the loss officially knocked the Trojans out of the Mountain Pacific Sports Federation playoff picture.
“We kept our focus really narrow and understood that if we took care of our problems in the here-and-now each week then the playoffs were going to become realistic,” USC head coach Bill Ferguson said. “But that just wasn’t going to be the case for us, and we weren’t able to get the ship in the right direction early enough.”
Still, it was the Trojans who found themselves playing the role of the spoiler on Saturday night. The Matadors entered the match with only a slim lead over Hawai’i for the last playoff spot.
Though CSUN started off the season with a number of impressive wins, including an early victory over the Trojans, it has tapered off as of late, winning only one of its last seven matches. Motivated to win for the sake of the seniors, the Trojans were ready to take advantage of the Matadors’ recent woes.
The first set of the match was well-fought by both sides. In fact, the two teams were tied at 17 different points and the lead changed hands seven times.
Luckily, sophomore opposite hitter Cristian Rivera was there to take control of the match for USC. His 10 kills in the first set allowed the Trojans to pull away in the end and take the set 25-23.
“Cristian [Rivera] did a good job watching video this week and understanding where the openings in the block were going to be,” Ferguson said. “We’ve been working with him on getting out of situations where he was being too conservative, and I think that boded well for his performance.”
The next set was much more lopsided as the Trojans rode their momentum to an early 8-3 advantage. While CSUN was able to pull within two a few times, USC held the lead for good. This time, USC followed the lead of Booth, who put up seven of his 13 kills in the second set. With his help, the Trojans won 25-17 and took a 2-0 advantage going into the third set.
Once again, USC jumped ahead at the start of the third set and CSUN failed to keep up. With Booth at the service line, the Trojans strung together four straight points, giving them a comfortable lead and putting their opponents just out of reach. With his match-high 18th kill, Rivera finished off the Matadors and clinched the senior-night sweep for USC 25-23, 25-22, 25-19.
It might not have counted toward the playoffs, but it was still a meaningful victory for the Trojans.
“You could see the guys in the locker room perk up a bit when we told them that Chris [Trefzger] and J.B. [Green] were going to start the match,” Ferguson said. “It was great to see their teammates respond and play hard for them and I think they both had phenomenal nights.”
The sweep was USC’s first since it defeated Stanford at home on Jan. 18 and moves USC to 6-16 on the season. Though they were outblocked by Cal State, the Trojans had a great night statistically that was highlighted by their impressive .418 hitting percentage.
USC will play its final two games of the season this week with a Wednesday night match at UC Santa Barbara followed by the rivalry matchup at UCLA on Friday.
Good win for the two seniors. Much needed win is a laugh. Team out of the conf. playoffs before that match which
falls on the coaching staff. Even with Cal Baptist ineligible for the tourney Trojans nowhere near in the standings
to play for the eighth seed in the last two matches on the schedule. Please ask the Coach why there was not one
non-conf. on the schedule this season?

Back in October, wide receivers coach Tee Martin offered one of the best soundbites of the 2012 season as he attempted to explain then-sophomore George Farmer’s inability to crack the wide receiver rotation despite his abundance of talent.
“God has blessed that kid with a lot of tools,” Martin said. “I joke with him, ‘You’re a Ferrari.’ And everything has to work right for that Ferrari to run the way you want it to run.”
Yet every time that Ferrari seemingly turns a corner, it stalls on the side of the road and gets passed by 2004 Toyota Matrixes, bearing 150,000 miles and a jelly donut-stained passenger seat (sorry, Mom).
Unfortunately for Farmer, this time around, his injury recovery will not be measured in days but in months. While participating in a noncontact drill on Tuesday, the 6-foot-1, 205-pound speedster planted his left leg awkwardly, tearing both his ACL and MCL. His pending knee surgery will sideline him for the 2013 season.
Many will invariably harp on Farmer’s budding “injury-prone” reputation, with this latest setback adding to their confirmation bias. But unlike many of his other past ailments, including frequent hamstring flare-ups since his arrival in the summer of 2011, this one was not preventable through more pre-practice stretching or post-practice icing on the trainer’s table.
As redshirt sophomore running back Tre Madden, who suffered a nearly identical noncontact knee injury last spring, can attest, there is neither rhyme nor reason for such a frightening injury.
When Farmer returns to the USC practice field, both of his former Serra High School teammates — Robert Woods and Marqise Lee — will, in all likelihood, have already departed for the NFL as marquee draft picks and franchise saviors. That’s what makes Farmer’s eventual return all the more interesting.
Rewind time to 2011 and tell any of the high school football scouts that Lee, not Farmer, would claim the Biletnikoff as a sophomore and they might have had you institutionalized. Farmer was rated 12th in ESPN’s ballyhooed top-150 list of prospects — first at his position and first in the fertile recruiting grounds of California — whereas Lee rocketed up the charts later in the recruitment process, topping out at No. 96 on the list.
No doubt it’s laughable now to think Lee barely slipped within the top-10 California high school players during his recruitment. But Farmer used to outshine Lee daily, as they played alongside each other on the same practice field and on Friday nights. In fact, for much of his high school career, the prolific duo of Farmer and Woods blocked Lee from earning significant snaps on offense.
Roles have since reversed at USC, as once-in-a-generation talents Woods and Lee have earned the right to be consistently targeted throughout the past two seasons at the expense of Farmer and basically anyone else in cardinal and gold who has run a route at some point. But that’s precisely the reason why Farmer’s injury marks a blessing of sorts: It buys him time.
This spring, at best, Farmer had solidified his position as the No. 3 wide receiver behind Lee and sophomore Nelson Agholor. Yet, in a USC offense that will break in a new starting quarterback and is expected to emphasize a power running game and utilize its tight ends more, Farmer’s production this season would have been marginal at best anyway. His greatest impact might have been felt on special teams as a returner or gunner.
By delaying the expiration date on his eligibility after redshirting this season, Farmer will return in 2014 to a less-crowded depth chart at receiver, where he could presumably pair with Agholor as another vertical deep threat. And if he proves durable after his recovery, he will have two seasons — instead of one — to show what he can do with his high school teammates out of the picture. Simply put, once out from underneath Woods and Lee’s shadow in 2014-15, Farmer will have his first real opportunity since stepping on campus to play a meaningful role on game days and put his considerable talents on film for NFL scouts.
Of course, other unfortunate scenarios might unfurl for Farmer. Some of the younger, talented wide receivers might seize the additional repetitions made available by his injury as an opportunity to convince Martin and the rest of the coaching staff to accelerate their development time. Upon his return, Farmer might never fully regain his athleticism and might harbor distrust in making the same cuts he once did. For an example of this, look no further than junior running back D.J. Morgan, who still, at times, expresses a lack of confidence in his knee, surgically-repaired after an injury he sustained as a high school senior.
But neither of these scenarios looms as daunting as spending three seasons competing against at least two members of the Woods-Lee-Agholor troika for playing time, then trying to make a last-ditch case for an NFL future as a senior. Though it’s impossible to predict how Farmer will respond, at least he can take solace in the fact that the additional year of eligibility his injury affords will offer him a better chance of playing in the NFL.

Throughout the course of the season, USC men’s tennis head coach Peter Smith has emphasized the importance of adversity and its positive effects.
Making it look easy · Junior Ray Sarmiento (above) had no trouble taking down the Utah Utes’ Dmytro Mamedov, beating the senior 6-1, 6-1 in less than 70 minutes. The Trojans beat Utah by a final score of 5-2. — Ralf Cheung | Daily Trojan
If adversity is a good thing, it was a great weekend for the Trojans, who, despite the absence of two starters and injuries to two more key players, pulled out two decisive victories including a 7-0 sweep of Arizona on Friday and a 5-2 win over Utah on Saturday.
In both matches the Trojans were without the services of junior Emilio Gomez and sophomore Roberto Quiroz. The pair, dubbed “Team Ecuador” by Smith, was playing for the Ecuadorian national team in Davis Cup play.
In addition to the absences of two starters, freshman Max de Vroome was still recovering from a broken left wrist and played with a specially designed brace. Junior Michael Grant also struggled with an abdominal injury, which flared up during the match and rendered him unable to overhead serve against Utah’s sophomore Cedric Willems. The significant handicap hampered Grant, who fought valiantly but eventually fell 6-3, 7-5.
“[My abdominal muscle] just started cramping up, so I just started serving underhand,” Grant said. “We had nobody else who could take my place so I just had to man up and play, win or lose. I gave it my best effort.”
Court two featured a duel between two heavyweights as sophomore Yannick Hanfmann took on Utah’s Slim Hamza. Hamza, who had upset UCLA’s No. 2 junior Adrien Puget 7-5, 6-4 the day prior, was in search of his second straight upset against Hanfmann.
But while Hamza fought admirably, Hanfmann controlled the outcome of the match from the outset. In the first set, Hanfmann mixed up his approach against his opponent, utilizing deep, heavy strokes with blistering, razor-sharp angled shots. When Hamza tried to shorten points by flattening his shots, Hanfmann ended the points with his own whistling forehand winners en route to a 7-5, 6-2 victory.
Hanfmann’s teammate and captain junior Ray Sarmiento was dominant in his outing against Utah senior Dmytro Mamedov. Sarmiento handled his match by flattening out early and forcing Mamedov to pursue high-velocity groundstrokes. Mamedov was often relegated to slicing or forced to settle with making contact with his outstretched arm while in pursuit of the icy Sarmiento’s endless hail of powerful, flat forehands.
The match seemed to go as quickly as Sarmiento’s feet — the 6-1, 6-1 drubbing lasted a mere 68 minutes.
“My movement was working really well for me today. I was serving really well and looked for my opportunities to come in. My game plan was to come in and take the point really early. Keep the points as short as possible and keep him moving,” Sarmiento said.
Even more dominant than Sarmiento was sophomore Eric Johnson, who utterly bulldozed Utah junior Alejandro Medinilla in a 6-0, 6-0 match that lasted little more than an hour. The 6-0, 6-0 victory was possibly the most impressive performance of the season from any Trojan, but Johnson remained humble and comprehensive in his description of his strategy.
“Staying focused was the hardest thing,” Johnson said. “I think my game fit him pretty well. He had a one-handed backhand that’s sort of weaker and my style is to play to attack the backhand.”
Sophomore Jonny Wang got the start at No. 4 and handled his responsibilities in dominant fashion, upending Utah junior Devin Lane 6-4, 6-3 with a high-energy style of play and emotional intensity that has endeared him to many USC tennis fans.
Rhe Trojans weren’t quite done after Saturday’s match. Smith, assistant coaches Krzysztof Kwinta and Peter Lucassen and the rest of the USC tennis team met and hit some balls with the ballboys and ballgirls at the match. The ballboys and ballgirls were organized by a USC alumnus to give them an opportunity to meet the tennis team.
“I think one of the biggest responsibilities we have is to give back. We invite the kids out and they get to ballkid the match, and then they get a chance to meet the players and hit with the players after the match,” Smith said. “The incredible thing about that is that it’s against the NCAA rules. How amazing is that? They’re saying it might be a recruiting advantage for us.”
The NCAA might not have too many concerns in that regard — none of the ballkids appeared to be older than six years of age.
And though the Trojans took care of important Pac-12 conference matches Friday and Saturday, perhaps it was what they did after the competition that was most important.

Have we reached a point where television is more influential to popular culture than film?
Family ties · Bates Motel, staring Norman Bates (Freddie Highmore, left) and his mother, Norma Louise Bates (Vera Farmiga, right), delves deeper into the backstory of how Norman became an infamous serial killer. – Courtesy of A&E
 
That’s what Vanity Fair seems to argue, at least. The lifestyle magazine made a point to say that television, rather than film, “enriches the iconography and collective lore of pop culture,” as culture critic James Wolcott was quoted as saying in the April 3 edition of Vanity Fair.
It’s true — a Friday-night trip to the movies doesn’t hold the same appeal it used to; rather, we seem to be gravitating more toward television, which is available all day, every day, allowing viewers to watch a variety of shows easily.
More and more, cinema that was once intended for the movies seems to be moving to the television screen. The new show Bates Motel is one example, designed to give a modern introduction to the historic Psycho horror film.
The whole Psycho film franchise, originally created by Alfred Hitchcock, centers on a horror story that depicts the encounter between a secretary and disturbed motel owner Norman Bates. It’s a part of cinematic history, considered by some to be the “mother” of modern slasher films. Today, the motel’s set is still part of Universal Studio’s Studio Tour.
The creators of Bates Motel clearly could have taken the traditional route and created a new movie based off the Psycho film franchise, but instead, they chose the medium of television.
This is all despite the fact that a Psycho TV spinoff had been attempted once before and failed.
Perhaps this tells us something about society: our generation has a constant need for more and more information. A continuing weekly storyline gives viewers more information, more suspense, more romance, more drama than what can be packed into a two-hour film. Perhaps television’s week-by-week nature feeds into our media-centric, “I want it now,” mentality.
Wolcott’s opinion in Vanity Fair brings up a sort of elephant in the room — that we would rather watch a show with a continuing storyline that can evolve into a more nuanced plot instead of a terminative two-hour affair.
Bates Motel, which premiered in late March, is able to explore more issues than the films ever did. It’s a series that explores more about the characters and delves deeper into the mindset of the infamous serial killer Norman. Moreover, despite Norman’s inevitable destiny, each episode is able to string the audience along with cliffhangers, leaving the audience with more of a sense of mystery — and more of a reason to watch — than a film which has a conclusive ending.
There are issues that television allows you to explore on a deeper level than a movie might. Often, there are depictions of murderers portrayed onscreen, but with Bates Motel, television producers have more time to draw from the characters’ earlier days and look at the causes of these kinds of issues.
In an Entertainment Weekly interview, executive producers Kerry Ehrin and Carlton Cuse commented on Norman’s future and this ensuing mental illness.
“This is a little more of a slow burn,” Ehrin said. “Like any mental illness, it’s erratic. It doesn’t necessarily have a predictable progression to it. And I think it’s going to act out in certain places and then I think it can be dormant for a space of time.”
Ultimately, this is one of the most compelling aspects of the show. It asks how insanity come about, and when it starts? And what are some early signs or possible contributors?
Cuse explored different factors from Norman’s past that might have contributed to his precarious mental state.
“I started thinking about what if Norman Bates has a brother, or this weird drug town,” Cuse said.
The producers are clearly looking at the extent and origin of Norman’s craziness in an original and captivating way.
In the third episode -— the most recent, which aired April 1 –— Freddie Highmore, who plays Norman, creates a powerful portrayal of a young boy haunted by pornographic pictures and stories of mystery women from a sketchbook. After he faints in his classroom, he needs to be hospitalized. What’s fascinating, though, is watching the secrecy and obsession take a toll on Norman, pushing him one step closer to the character that fans of the film franchise are familiar with.
Perhaps, with all of this intrigue and drama, TV shows such as Bates Motel are lessening the cultural impact of film as time goes by. However, that does not necessarily have to be alarming. As long as producers, such as Ehrin and Cuse, are at the helm creating alluring, cliffhanging episodes dealing with bigger societal issues at hand, the world might be ready for more television.

Rarely does a director film a movie only to shelve the footage in order to work on a more high-profile project. After all, the filmmaking process is a costly and time-consuming endeavor that requires a singular focus.
Hypnotizing · Trance, the chilling film by acclaimed U.K. director Danny Boyle, focuses on an art auctioneer, Franck, played by Vincent Cassel, who gets mixed up with a criminal gang after suffering serious head trauma. – Courtesy of Greg Gayne
Yet when a filmmaker has received the level of praise and acclaim that director Danny Boyle has, traditional or ordinary never seem to apply.
Such was the case with Trance. After Boyle was selected as the director of the opening ceremony for the 2012 London Olympic Games, he worked seven-day weeks, spending five days on Trance and two days on ceremony development. Upon conclusion of principal photography for the film, he and his editor, Jon Harris, assembled an early rough cut and then let the film rest until late last year.
Distributed in limited release this April by frequent Boyle collaborator Fox Searchlight Pictures, Trance is a uniquely imagined story. Forced by a group of criminals, an art auctioneer attempts to uncover the location of a missing painting through hypnotic treatment. During the theft, the auctioneer, Simon (James McAvoy), suffers a blow to the head, causing amnesia.
In an attempt to stimulate his memory, he and the gang leader, Franck (Vincent Cassel), employ the services of hypnotherapy through Elizabeth (Rosario Dawson). A gripping tale of romance and suspense unfolds as the film delves deeper and deeper into Simon’s mind.
From a broad perspective, the narrative at the core of the film is quite simple. Three characters — Simon, Franck, and Elizabeth — dominate the script; every scene presents at least one as the focus. Yet, the film in its entirety is by no definition simple. Simon, Franck and Elizabeth are each written  by screenwriters Joe Ahearne and John Hodge with multiple dimensions and rich development, leaving you constantly questioning the motives and moral alignment of the three central characters. Those who initially seem to be victimized hint at signs of wickedness in other scenes. The mired presentation of the characters’ principles allows the audience to be deeply engaged with the subject. The individual viewer acts as an additional external player in the story, deciphering the characters’ action just as the characters size each other up. Thus, you are left thinking and attempting to solve the film for yourself.
By enticing the audience to contemplate the film’s conclusion, Ahearne and Hodge intensify the effect of the script’s many twists and turns. Though unexpected story elements can often seem unrealistic or implausible, the sudden changes in Trance are enveloped in realism, for they are validated by the audience imaginative speculation.
But though the script is carefully constructed and frequently excellent, Ahearne and Hodge nearly complicate the story to a frantically convoluted level.
The divide between intriguing complexity and confusing complexity is highly permeable, making it easy for Ahearne and Hodge to overcomplicate from the film’s onset. Though most of the intricacy is added for useful dramatic effect, the film’s third act is written to emphasize the story’s twists. It appears as if their ideas for holding the audience’s attention and intrigue began to run thin as the film reaches its conclusion.
Yet any flaw in the script is combated by Boyle’s expectably superb directing. Look no further than the film’s opening heist scene: Many directors would follow convention and direct the sequence with a haphazard, overly energetic style. Boyle, on the other hand, injects stability into the action and immediately grounds the film to some extent in reality, albeit in a slightly hyper form. His tense direction is especially invaluable in this first scene as it is the topic of mystery discussed throughout the rest of film.
Boyle, in addition to pacing the action well presents the story in a manner that aids the audience’s thought processes. He carefully alludes to clues and hints at certain truths explained later in the film, and expertly provides the audience with enough information to gestate predictions in the viewers’ mind but holds back from spoiling the plot. In particular, the way he teases certain events really works to pull you even further into the film’s story.
The cinematography and set design of Trance seduce and allures, thanks to work from cinematographer Anthony Dod Mantle and production designer Mark Tildesley. Both utilize a wide palette of neon colors that jump off the screen and create a unique visual style.
Mantle’s camera movement in particular has a kinetic and hypnotic nature about it, which few recent films have achieved. Paired with Harris’s masterful editing, the aesthetics succeed at portraying Simon’s disorienting amnesia and Elizabeth’s spellbinding hypnotism. The detailed visuals bring the viewer further into the film, compelling more and more intellectual contemplation.
On the whole, Trance is one of the best films released thus far in 2013, as it truly lives it up to its title by enthralling the viewer in a complex tale much larger and more impactful than a mere art heist.

A federal judge on Friday struck down restrictions on Plan B, a birth control pill designed to be taken after sex to prevent possible pregnancy. According to NPR, within 30 days, the Food and Drug Administration will allow women to buy Plan B and generic counterparts without prescriptions or age-based restrictions.
The ruling came in response to the restrictions placed on the drug by Secretary of Health and Human Services Kathleen Sebelius. Sebelius originally mandated that girls under 17 needed a prescription to get the drug. In his opinion, Judge Edward Korman wrote that the restrictions placed on the drug by Sebelius were “arbitrary and capricious” and influenced by “politics” rather than facts, according to the Washington Post.
Korman is absolutely correct in his legal reasoning. There was no reason to place an age restriction on the acquisition of the drug. True, young people should not be having unprotected sex, as they are unlikely to be able to fully comprehend the emotional implications of these activities, but marginalizing girls who do have sex is morally reprehensible. Society should not burden these girls with pregnancies.
Opponents of unfettered access to Plan B argue that giving young girls access to Plan B will encourage them to further engage in sexual activities because they know they have a safety net if they do not use contraceptives before possible insemination. These same groups have made similar arguments about educating young women about safe sex practices rather than preaching abstinence, saying that telling girls there is a safe way to have sex only increases sexual activity.
According to Advocates for Youth, a nonprofit advocacy group, about 50 percent of teenagers have had sex and abstinence-only education has not reduced the amount of sex teenagers are having. It has, instead, increased the rate of unsafe sex in which already sexually active teenagers are engaging. Similarly, giving teens access to Plan B will not increase the amount of sex that teenagers have but will instead reduce the numbers of teen pregnancies in this country.
Teenage pregnancy is a significant burden on society. The 750,000 yearly teen pregnancies cost American taxpayers an average of $10.9 billion annually, or an average of $14,500 per pregnancy, according to a report from Planned Parenthood. Aside from the cost to the taxpayers in lost revenue from the mother, teen pregnancies usually result in less education for both parent and child and increase the chances that the mother will be living in poverty and relying on government-funded welfare programs.
Consequently, giving access to Plan B that decreases the likelihood of teenage pregnancy will save taxpayers significant amounts of money. Plan B costs about $50, which is significantly less than the burden placed on society by not preventing pregnancies arising from inevitable sexual activity.
If American lawmakers want to legislate morality and decrease teenage sex, then they should consider addressing some of the root causes of sexual behavior rather than simply denying women access to modern medical technology.
So far, policymakers have been unable to find a serious and effective solution to inexpensively decreasing teenage sex. If policymakers continue to be unable to find a solution, then the legislatures should turn their attentions toward making sex safe and eliminating the negative consequences from sex. Reducing access to Plan B was a move in the wrong direction, one that, luckily, the court has now reversed.
Eliminating the need for a prescription to Plan B also helps older women. Under the previous rules, adult women considered responsible enough to make their own choices about their reproductive health needed to show their IDs to prove that they were old enough to legally buy the contraceptive without a prescription. Consequently, pharmacists had information about the private lives of women. Expecting women to involve more people in their own reproductive choices is embarrassing and invasive.
The only groups still uncomfortable with Korman’s decision to eliminate the restrictions on access to Plan B are out of touch with the facts. Women are going to have sex, and, occasionally, women are going to get pregnant as a result. Instead of marginalizing the women who want to make their own decisions about their reproductive health, society should give these women support and guarantee their reproductive rights.

High school senior Suzy Lee Weiss recently hit the national spotlight after writing a controversial letter to the Wall Street Journal titled “To (All) the Colleges that Rejected Me.”
Juno Zhu | Daily Trojan
In it, Weiss, who is Caucasian, mentions that one of the reasons for her rejection from an elite undergraduate institution is her lack of “diversity.”
“For starters, had I known two years ago what I know now, I would have gladly worn a headdress to school. Show me to any closet, and I would’ve happily come out of it,” she writes.
To continue, Weiss adds how “if it were up to me, I would’ve been any of the diversities: Navajo, Pacific Islander, anything.”
To call Weiss’ letter a racist rant would be going a bit too far, but the letter does reveal some distasteful thoughts coming from an out-of-touch young woman. And, most importantly, this whole situation highlights a great problem within contemporary American thinking about race: In her mind, growing up with business-owner parents, a standard education and white skin are disadvantages.
There is no debate that people of color face dramatically longer odds when it comes to economic subsistence. When examining statistics from 2009, the median net worth of white households was $113,149, compared with $6,325 for Hispanics and $5,677 for blacks, according to the Pew Research Center.
Just last week, BET founder Bob Johnson said the United States would “never tolerate white unemployment at 14 or 15 percent,” despite the fact that the rate of black unemployment has been consistently more than double that of white unemployment for the past five decades.
To the point of Weiss’ letter, education — universally hailed as the driving means of raising people out of poverty — also has a large achievement gap between races. According to the Pew Research Center, about 40 percent of Caucasians between the ages of 25 and 29 have a four-year degree, but the rate falls to 23 for blacks and 15 percent for Hispanics of the same age range.
Weiss is going to go to college. Despite how her letter portrays herself, she has been accepted to a number of other prestigious institutions that will provide her with the skillset to be a “successful” person. Meanwhile, the fact that far fewer black and Hispanic students have a four-year degree when compared with their white peers is a problem that is not getting better with time.
Affirmative action in education has been shown to be successful, and there is no question that minority students suffer without it. Just compare statistics from 1995 — the year the University of California elected to eliminate affirmative action — to today. In 1995, black students composed 7.3 percent of admitted freshmen at UC Berkeley. But, in 2012, that number was projected to be 3.5 percent. The same is reflected at UCLA, where the rate dropped from 6.7 percent to 3.8 percent.
The case can be made that minority students don’t get accepted without affirmative action simply because they are not qualified. But though there might be a sliver of truth to this statement, the dramatic correlations between race, wealth and achievement make it inexcusable to not help people of color receive the education needed to escape poverty, especially considering the fact that the United States’ problematic education system makes it difficult for many minority students to truly show their potential at school.
Affirmative action is an understandably controversial topic, but the original aims of affirmative action are often lost in the red-herring claims of the policy as a form of reparations and reverse racism.
The purpose of affirmative action in education is to provide minority individuals with equal opportunities by leveling an uneven playing field and giving children a fairer chance to succeed in school and in life. For one, it has been shown that children of college-educated parents, regardless of the parents’ prior histories, have statistical advantages for greater achievement than do the children of parents without similar educations.
With the deck already stacked against minority youth with aspirations of higher education,  affirmative action is one of the few measures that contributes to genuine racial equality.
Yet affirmative action continues to be threatened in education. A case currently before the Supreme Court, Fisher v. University of Texas, aims to reverse the 2003 court case Grutter v. Bollinger, which upheld affirmative action admissions practices. A ruling could mean the end of affirmative action practices in public universities.
Hopefully, years from now, Weiss will realize her mistake in taking such a callous view toward racial equality in schools. Chances are, she’ll at least be extremely embarrassed by her immature words. Small cases such as this only go to show how far the U.S. has come and how far we still need to go.

Affirmatice action is nothing more than reverse discrimination.  I guess when we have the caucasian race at the bottom of the ladder everyone will be ok with that.  But, now we need a system to cater to all folks who are not white.  The majority of the problem is within the ethnic groups who lack the strong family structure and push for education that is needed to have successful children.  It is a cycle that repeats itself over and over, but the thought that society and educational institutions are all stacked up against everyone from different ethnic backgrounds is retarded.  You will never have some eqaul split, which is what I think many seek.  There are many factors for the applicants besides demographics that play a part.  As a previous coment stated, the Supreme Court struck down that idiotic practice because it is not the solution.
This author continually notes that the “playing field” is not “leveled” and that minorities have it harder than Caucasians (by citing the scientific accuracy of a statement from the founder of BET), without ever providing a reason or evidence for this disadvantage. He takes it as a given that there is an inherent inability for Hispanic or African-Ameircan students to do as well as Caucasian students academically. The discrepancy is economic, not racial. The more AA stays racial, the more reverse racism will be an actual reality. To say that race is the SOLE culprit of this discrepancy is misguided and ignorant at best, flat-out stupid and, dare I say, racist at worst. Not only does it imply that affluent Hispanics or African-Americans still need the help because of their inherent academic inabilities, but also that underprivileged Caucasians will run into none of the problems of underprivileged minorities because, well, they’re white obviously.
In concurrence with some of the previous comments, I’d like to say that economic affirmative action far better serves the purported objectives than racial affirmative action.
The “leveling the playing field” justification for racial preferences is a nonstarter, since the Supreme Court long ago rejected it, and it is no longer offered by universities.  And the Court was right to reject it, since there are people of all colors at both ends of the playing field, so it makes no sense to use skin color as a proxy for disadvantage.  Indeed, 86 percent of the African Americans who are admitted to the more selective schools come from middle- or upper-class backgrounds.
In any event, not only does the columnist not give any good reason for this discrimination, but he ignores all the costs:  It is personally unfair, passes over better qualified students, and sets a disturbing legal, political, and moral precedent in allowing racial discrimination; it creates resentment; it stigmatizes the so-called beneficiaries in the eyes of their classmates, teachers, and themselves, as well as future employers, clients, and patients; it mismatches African Americans and Latinos with institutions, setting them up for failure (the columnist gives the admission numbers for UC post Prop 209, but not the graduation numbers); it fosters a victim mindset, removes the incentive for academic excellence, and encourages separatism; it compromises the academic mission of the university and lowers the overall academic quality of the student body; it creates pressure to discriminate in grading and graduation; it breeds hypocrisy within the school and encourages a scofflaw attitude among college officials; it papers over the real social problem of why so many African Americans and Latinos are academically uncompetitive; and it gets states and schools involved in unsavory activities like deciding which racial and ethnic minorities will be favored and which ones not, and how much blood is needed to establish group membership – an untenable legal regime as America becomes an increasingly multiracial, multiethnic society and as individual Americans are themselves more and more likely to be multiracial and multiethnic (starting with our president).
To the Author:
While I agree with your premise that racial equality in school is good and beneficial to students, I disagree with the assumption you make that the modern realities of affirmative action are equal to its original intents. Affirmative action today should be geared to economic inequalities rather than racial ones. Doing so would largely achieve the same goal of creating greater racial diversity, since as you yourself pointed out, minorities tend to have lower average annual incomes. However, it would stop the misuse of the program, in which minority youths who grew up equally affluent to their Caucasian counterparts are given an advantage simply because of the color of their skin. 
This is what Ms. Weiss was pointing out. If, in the instances when minority youths are raised in equally affluent and opportunity-enabled societies as their Caucasian counterparts, we continue to allow affirmative action to take place it IS racism (I refuse to use the term reverse-racism). One racial group is being favored over another, simply because of the color of their skin.  Ms. Weiss should be praised for speaking so fairly about a system that has been often misused. She may have gotten into other prestigious universities, but that does not mean she should have to settle for a lesser school merely because she is Caucasian.
