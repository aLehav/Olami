When Margot May helped found Fit Like A Girl in Spring 2019, she felt that USC lacked an all-female community to engage in fitness and health outside of University sports. Since its inception, May, the social media head of Fit Like A Girl, and other founders of the club hope to empower members to become their best selves and bring together a diverse community of college-aged women through planned fitness activities.
As of Spring 2020, the club boasts a roster of more than 100 members and serves as a perfect group workout system for girls looking for a fitness community, said Alya Kalra, the Fit Like A Girl event coordinator.
“If you want a place where you can meet a lot of girls, if you want to try a different workout routine … I think this is the perfect club for them,” Kalra said.
Natalie Ospeck, a sophomore majoring in global health, said she and other members of Fit Like A Girl were inspired to lead the club by a desire to bring girls together and introduce them to what it means to have an active lifestyle. 
“I always loved working out when I was younger and in high school,” Ospeck said. “Coming to college where I didn’t have that organization around working out, it was a little bit stressful … And so we’re inspired just by bringing girls together and inspiring a healthy lifestyle in college because it can be hard to fit in workouts.”
Members pay a $10 fee each semester to meet at different fitness studios either on or near campus for a workout session once a week. In the past, Fit Like A Girl has partnered with CorePower Yoga, Studio Club Pilates, Clube Brazilian Jiu Jitsu and Bespoke Cycling. 
The club sends out polls to members at the end of each semester and gauges which workouts members enjoyed the most to ensure everyone has a say in future workouts and studios that they attend, Ospeck said. 
“We really want to make it an affordable thing for people,” Ospeck said. “So we really look for studios who are either willing to volunteer their time and let us try a class or give us a discounted group rate.”
For Audrey Geis, a sophomore majoring in business administration, Fit Like A Girl stands out from other athletic clubs because it is not geared toward rigorous training but toward building a community and a support system for its members. 
“The main purpose of our club isn’t really to get an amazing workout,” Geis said. “The point of it is to bring girls [together] that are involved in a lot of different things on campus or might not have found a way to meet each other.” 
Kalra joined Fit Like A Girl in January 2019 after a friend recommended the organization as a way to stay active with a group of girls with similar interests.
“I always liked being in a group setting when I was working out, which, I thought, motivates people to work out and be active more so than if you’re just going alone to the gym,” said Kalra, a sophomore majoring in public policy.
Kalra is responsible for reaching out to various studios both within and outside of USC to see whether they would be willing to host a class. 
“[Last year], we went to a Jiu Jitsu studio that was run by a USC [alumnus],” Kalra said. “He kind of turned it into a self-defense class and that was really fun even though it is pretty serious to learn about self defense.” 
Fit Like A Girl was originally part of the organization CHAARG, a national institution that aims to ignite college girls with a passion for health and fitness. Due to $45 dues and limited events available on the West Coast, the founders decided to separate from CHAARG to start their own group. 
“[CHAARG] is a tremendous organization,” said May, a sophomore majoring in public policy. “We have so much respect for them. However, their commitment required a lot more of us than we thought was necessary.” 
Kalra said she benefits from having a group that holds its members accountable to living a healthy and active lifestyle.
“One of our first workouts last semester was with Orange Theory,” May said. “We had over 60 girls and it was a really hard workout … It was kind of empowering to see a bunch of girls work out together and also just fun to see people who wouldn’t necessarily be friends or wouldn’t necessarily meet each other in any other sphere of USC become friends.”
For members like Geis, progress is going better than ever with all the hard work and commitment members have put into the message since Fit Like A Girl was founded at USC. 
“I’m really proud of all our work because we’ve made a lot of great connections with different studios that are in L.A.,” Geis said. “That’s made it a lot easier, especially this semester, to just reach out to people we’ve worked with already that we know.”

Four Iovine and Young Academy students are shaking up the standards of e-commerce by  creating a smart, sustainable, zero-waste alternative to single-use cardboard boxes. Hundreds of billions of boxes are manufactured and thrown away each year, according to a 2014 ABB report.
Del Necessary, Steven Schwartz, Donielle Sullivan and Jim Welty, graduate students in IYA’s integrated design, business and technology master’s program, have founded Infinity Boxx, an early-stage startup aiming to tackle the increasing package waste in e-commerce through their smart, reusable and recyclable boxes all managed within a sustainable, closed loop supply chain that creates negligible waste by controlling each box’s life cycle and refurbishment themselves.
The Infinity Boxx is made from post-consumer plastic, lasts for over 100 uses and collects data on temperature, pressure and location changes. The startup is currently in its prototype stages but, once accessible, will allow customers to use features like a doorstep theft detection in an app.
If a customer orders an expensive case of wine in an Infinity Boxx, they’ll be able to track temperature changes throughout the entire journey. So will the carriers, who can ensure the wines aren’t heat damaged. Because of its adjustable design, the Infinity Boxx will be able to ship anything from a single pencil to that case of wine, accommodating nearly any sized e-commerce purchase.
The co-founders are pitching and prototyping the product to address environmental waste and customers’ lack of real-time temperature, pressure and location information on their purchases. Their journey began after Sullivan pitched the idea for a reusable box to her Integrative Project Lab class in Spring 2019.
“Single-use boxes … are circulating and catastrophically leaving a billion trees of waste and 8 million tons of plastic every year,” Sullivan said. “This is [an] unprecedented volume of objects moving that we’ve now created a solution [for].” 
Sullivan continued to speak on the challenge of tackling large amounts of waste, further complicated by different government’s regulations, available technologies and long-established business practices. 
“When we hesitate or feel overwhelmed, it’s because it really is such a gargantuan challenge and it’s in such a complex ecosystem that involves so many regulations, so many moving parts and so many different technology solutions and physical design solutions,” Sullivan said.
Necessary, who designs the boxes, said he used the technology skills he accrued in his IYA classes to turn the idea into reality.
“When I saw what we could do with a little $35 Arduino computer … It was one thing to build the physical box, which I’ve long felt confident that we can do that,” Necessary said. “It’s seeing the technology work, and networked objects allowed us to do that.” 
While considering different designs, the team kept its goals simple: Replace single-use cardboard, introduce fresh ideas to the packaging industry, reduce costs for production and customers and eliminate tape, which damages packaging. 
Sullivan said it was Welty’s idea to reframe the perspective of the packaging business from “packaging as an object” to “packaging as a service.”
“When we reframed in that perspective, it really has [a job to deliver] the items within it safely without damage and with good information exchange to a destination,” Sullivan said. “You begin to explore the possibilities that are at stake when you bring technology into these containers.”
The team members credited IYA classes with teaching them to design products with consumers in mind. They also aim to control the entire life cycle of their boxes by creating their own refurbishment centers to recycle used boxes into new ones.
Jay Clewis, an IYA professor who has taught the Infinity Boxx founders in two classes, Opportunities and Uncertainties Integrative Project Lab and Capstone Final Project said he has seen the team members grow throughout the development process of the company.
“They’re really taking the time to explore and talk to the right people to figure out what are the right materials, what are the right sizes, what are the right aspects of this thing?” Clewis said. “You don’t just add features and functionality for the sake of it. They’re really trying to understand the problem pattern.”
In addition to identifying and proposing an innovative solution to the growing challenge of sustainability in e-commerce, the cause of the startup’s current success has been its team dynamic and ability to communicate their narrative to peers, mentors, and potential investors, the Infinity Boxx co-founders said.
“Infinity Boxx has managed to get over a number of hurdles to become a company that has a chance,” said Steve Barth, an IYA assistant professor of entrepreneurship who is teaching the Infinity Boxx founders’ capstone class. “They’re a great team. When you have an idea that’s traveling all the way through the program … you really see how the idea develops.” 
The founders said they hope Infinity Boxx will revolutionize the global economy the same way shipping containers did: by creating a new standard by which goods can be transported across land, sea and air internationally, but with real-time data every step of the journey.
Sullivan said tackling the amount of waste has always been scrutinized in modern society, so the cohort hopes the Infinity Boxx can mitigate sustainability issues and provide helpful services to its customers.
“We think we can get through it, we can see the path, we know the form and we know what we want it to do,” Necessary said. “We’re actively trying to wrap our head around all of that, and we’re talking to as many people as we can, and it’s enlightening.”

Lynn Helding knew she wanted to be a singer when she was 8 years old. Now, years later, Helding is a professor of voice and coordinator of vocology and voice pedagogy at the Thornton School of Music and was named the 2020 Contemporary Commercial Music Institute Lifetime Achievement Award recipient by Shenandoah University for her research in cognitive neuroscience and the teaching of voice. 
Helding will receive the award in July when she gives the keynote address at the Contemporary Commercial Music Vocal Pedagogy Institute at the University. 
“It was a total surprise,” Helding said. “It is an honor to be there with the other past awardees … They just started [the award] in 2017, and I feel honored to be only the fourth awardee.”
Helding, who studies the intersection between cognitive neuroscience and vocology, has used her research findings in cognitive psychology to protect the vocal health of singers and enhance their learning and performance. She has also applied the mechanisms from her studies to ensure the physical well-being of her students. 
“The more we can understand how our body functions, the better we can sing but also the better we can teach, so when you start teaching, you really learn,” Helding said. “I would say that in performing arts, our singers are closest to dancers in terms of how we use our bodies.”
As part of her emphasis on vocal health, Helding brought in the vocal health component to the Musician’s Wellness Initiative program that Thornton professors William Kanengiser and Stephen Pierce started four years ago, right as Helding started her job at USC.
The Musician’s Wellness Initiative program is a partnership between Thornton and Keck School of Medicine in which Thornton student singers get screened at the start of each new academic year at the USC Voice Center.   
“The doctors look at their voice and make sure they have at least a baseline of good vocal health,” Helding said. “If they don’t, they get flagged and [are] advised to get services.” 
Thornton Dean Robert Cutietta said that Helding’s research was well-developed even before she came to USC but joined due to its medical school where she could further her research.  
“Her research is all about healthy singing,” Cutietta said. “It is really easy for a singer who isn’t trained properly to ruin her voice, to overuse it or use it incorrectly.” 
Helding said that as part of her research, she has read and analyzed hundreds of published academic articles on cognitive psychology and its application to classroom environments. 
“I had my own laboratory because I teach studio,” Helding said. “So, I started putting together my own experience as a teacher and coach and connecting the dots between what the research is saying about how people learn.” 
Lisa Sylvester, chair of the vocal arts and opera department at Thornton, said that the work done in the wellness program was critically important to the music industry and the way music was processed and performed. 
“[Her research] really represents a very high level and high standard of academic work,” Sylvester said.
Helding is also the author of “The Musician’s Mind: Teaching, Learning, and Performance in the Age of Brain Science” that released earlier this month. She started writing the book 10 years ago when she created a column called “Mindful Voice” in the Journal of Singing, where she introduced the mind as an important part of vocal science.
“She’s had a whole career developing this research,” Cutietta said. “It’s not as if there was just one study [where] she discovered something. This has been her whole career.”
The highlight of Helding’s research is the new focus of pedagogy that she has proposed. Cutietta said her specialization in the field complemented Thornton’s program that incorporates workshops on wellness components such as posture while practicing.   
“We had a search several years back, and we needed someone … who could teach the classes and who could advise our teaching assistants,” Sylvester said. “We needed someone for whom that was a focus and she was clearly the most qualified.” 
Helding said her study of pedagogy requires an understanding of how students learn.
“A paradigm shift in how we teach … should be on how well students learn,” Helding said. “You have to think about how people actually learn and how they learn best … Those are all questions that cognitive science is looking at.”
Helding said that she hopes to publish the second edition of “The Musician’s Mind.” Meanwhile, she wishes to pass on her legacy to her students, which is why she decided to work at USC after 22 years of teaching at Dickinson College. 
“I wanted to have graduate students,” Helding said. “As we near the end of our careers, we want to be able to pass on our intellectual property.”
