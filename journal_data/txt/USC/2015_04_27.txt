USC visited Ojai, California, from April 21 to April 26 to compete in the individual Pac-12 tournament, and they came back victorious, sweeping one of the two brackets.
Following their regular season Pac-12 team championship, the Women of Troy traveled to Ojai to battle for the individual singles and doubles championships. Due to the fact that only a certain number of players are able to compete for the singles and doubles championships, the other players participate in the invitational side of the bracket.
This is where USC found its success this year. For the fourth-straight year, USC captured the invitational singles title. This year, freshman Meredith Xepoleas demolished the competition en route to the title. She followed in the footsteps of current teammate junior Giuliana Olmos who won the title last year.
The championship match was Xepoleas’ 17th consecutive singles match victory as well as her fifth-straight set win of the tournament. The freshman was seeded No. 2 in the tournament, and it showed in her dismemberment of the field. In round 32, Xepoleas faced her most difficult match, a mere 6-3, 6-4. In each of her next two matches, she dropped only two games a piece, which was followed up by 6-2, 6-2 semifinal win.
Xepoleas would face UCLA’s Terri Fleming in the final on Sunday morning, and she crushed the Bruin 6-2, 6-3.
In the doubles invitational draw, the duo of senior Gabriella DeSimone and sophomore Zoë Katz delivered a similar beating to the field. In their first three matches, the pair lost no more than two games a match making their championship margin of 8-4 their toughest match of the tournament.
The team was in control of the final for a majority of the match and did not let Washington’s team get back into the fight.
USC’s hopes for a Pac-12 title were dashed in the semifinals and quarterfinals of singles and doubles, respectively.
For the Women of Troy, No. 14 Olmos was sent home Saturday by No. 25 Karla Fabikova of Cal in a 6-1, 6-2 match, and No. 45 Zoë Scandalis could not finish her match against UCLA’s Catherine Harrison. She had to retire due to an injury.  Harrison not only took out two Trojans, but also was the Pac-12 singles champion.
The other Women of Troy competing for the singles title were No. 21 Sabrina Santamaria who lost 6-2, 6-4 to the same Harrison that dispatched Scandalis in round 16. One day earlier, No. 55 Madison Westby lost to unranked Donika Bashota of Washington State in the first round by a score of 6-4, 4-6, 6-4.
The doubles teams for USC faced similar troubles. The freshman tandem of Gabby Smith and Westby was ousted 8-5 in round 16 by the Arizona team of Austin and Preston. The other doubles team, No. 20-ranked Olmos and Scandalis, was tripped up by the No. 2 team in the nation, and eventual Pac-12 champions, Davidson and Zhao of Stanford by a score of 8-3.

Armenian student leaders reflected on the Armenian Genocide after this weekend’s annual Los Angeles March For Justice, which aimed to recognize the atrocity, and President Barack Obama’s decision to not use the word genocide in a speech that addressed the killings.
The Armenian Genocide was a massacre that killed an estimated 1.5 million Armenians during its span from World War I in 1915 to the early 1920s.
Aleen Mayelian, co-president of the Armenian Law Students Association, said the genocide caused Armenians to lose their land and flee the country.
“Due to the genocide, the land that belonged to Western Armenian [is] under the control of Eastern Turkey now and so in addition to losing 1.5 million lives we also lost a large part of our territory,” Mayelian said. “Also due to the genocide, the Armenians have had to disperse to various different nations.”
Los Angeles is home to the largest Armenian population in America and is the largest grouping of Armenians outside of Armenia. More than 130,000 Los Angeles residents and other participants joined together to recognize the 100th anniversary of the mass killings in the March For Justice last Friday. Demonstrators marched from the Little Armenia area of Hollywood to the Turkish Consulate with flags and signs in hand.
Alexa Youssefian, cultural chair of the Armenian Students’ Association, said almost all of the Armenian Student Association executive board and members attended the march and that it was great to see Armenians marching together 100 years later after the genocide.
“It’s a stark contrast between, you know, having your people almost eliminated and then just in Los Angeles having 130,000 of your fellow Armenians around you,” Youssefian said. “It’s a testament to the reality that we’re here and that we’ve survived and that … we’re thriving. It was a great moment of unity and all of us there demanding justice was great to see.”
On April 21, White House officials said President Barack Obama would not be using the word genocide to describe the Armenian mass killings. Obama said in his 2008 campaign that he would recognize the execution as a genocide, but has failed to do so every year in office.
Youssefian said it doesn’t bother her anymore that Obama doesn’t recognize the executions as a genocide.
“For me and I think Armenians together feel that we don’t care at this point what Obama thinks,” Youssefian said. “It doesn’t matter. We are beyond that point. Obama’s silence is only reflecting … him bowing to politics. I don’t rely on Obama’s qualification of reality to substantiate the truth.”
Anoush Djrbashian, the International Student Assembly representative in the Armenian Students’ Association, said the Turkish government needs to recognize the genocide so Armenian people can have peace.
“It’s really important for not only the United States to recognize it, but also the Turkish government, because they need to come to terms with their history so the Armenian and Turkish people can finally, kind of, have this dark cloud that’s been above our heads for 100 years dissipate so we can finally have some peace between our people, which can only happen if there is adequate recognition and adequate reparation and restitution for what was taken from us during the genocide,” Djrbashian said.
April 24, 1915 marks the day Ottoman authorities executed educators, scientists, composers and other intellectuals and leaders. Youssefian said she is happy Armenians are obtaining those roles once again.
“Armenian resilience is incredible,” Youssefian said. “It’s so impressive to me that 100 years later we’re here, we’re alive, we’re thriving [and that] there’s so many successful Armenians reprising the roles that were lost in 1915.”
Armenians will never stop pushing for justice, according to Youssefian.
“We will never forget the truth,” Youssefian said. “We will never forget what happened in 1915 and we will still hold those responsible accountable and we will push the United States and other countries to recognize it, but we also move forward with our success towards the next 100 years.”

The state’s drought has been a hot discussion topic for Californians since Gov. Jerry Brown’s historic mandatory water restrictions, implemented at the beginning of April. The topic of water in California was discussed yet again on Monday, at The New Reality: Addressing California’s Water Culture, an event hosted by USC’s Schwarzenegger Institute and the Price School of Public Policy. The Public Policy Institute of California partnered with the two groups for the event.
Jack Knott, dean of the Price School of Public Policy, provided the event’s opening remarks.
“I’m really pleased that we are able to partner with the PPIC and the Schwarzenegger Institute,” Knott said, “We haven’t done this type of partnership in a while, so I’m really glad this is happening. Especially on such an important and critically powerful issue that we face in California today.”
Most urban areas in California have endured the drought without a major economic impact, largely due to improvements in technology and infrastructure. Local governments have addressed drought conditions by diversifying water supply, increasing surface and groundwater storage options, collecting storm water and reducing overall water demand.
The agriculture industry has been hit the hardest. According to PPIC, though many farmers have begun using groundwater rather than rainwater, the drought has caused $2 billion in losses and 17,000 lost jobs.
The event’s first panel, Addressing the California Water Challenge – Today, focused on the problems facing both urban and agricultural areas, and discussed possible solutions.
Knott also said that the institute excellently engages students.
“One of the things that I love about the Schwarezenegger Institute is that it always engages, invites and involves students to these events. They give them a prominent place in these events, and that’s not typical,” he said.
Though droughts are a recurring feature of California’s climate, climatologists have observed that California’s current crisis has worsened due to increasing temperatures.
“We’d like to look at this fourth year of drought as not just a crisis, but as an opportunity to look ahead and create a sustainable water future for the state of California,” said Bonnie Reiss, global director of the USC Schwarzenegger Institute.
Overall, the panel discussed the discrepancies of the drought’s impact across different localities.
The panel included Vito Chiesa, supervisor of Stanislaus County and president of the California State Association of Counties; Marcie Edwards, general manager of the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power; Felicia Marcus, chair of the State Water Resources Control Board; and Tim Quinn, executive director of the Association of California Water Agencies. Mark Baldassare, president and CEO of the PPIC, served as the panel’s moderator.
“We’re all in this together, I could say that over and over and over again so that people would stop pitting themselves against each other,” Chiesa said.
Edwards offered a similar comment while explaining what the LADWP is doing to combat the drought.
“We are moving past the arguing over bits and pieces and moving into implementation,” Edwards said.
For Los Angeles, this implementation means installing stormwater catchment systems, and tearing out ornamental lawns in favor of native landscaping.
The second panel, Addressing the California Water Challenge – The Future, Part 1, focused on how California policy can help the state in future droughts. Panelists included Juliet Christian-Smith, climate scientist with the Union of Concerned Scientists; Daniel Curtin, board member of the California Water Commission and director of the California Conference of Carpenters; James Famiglietti, UC Irvine professor and JPL’s senior water scientist; Robert Hertzberg, California State Senator; and Daniel Sumner, director of UC Agricultural Issues Center and professor at UC Davis. Val Zavala, vice president of news and public affairs for KCET, moderated the panel.
The second panel reiterated the first panel’s belief that it’s time to move past quarreling, and start looking for solutions.
“We need to change the conversation from urban versus rural, agriculture versus cities, and instead recognize the different uses for water,” Famiglietti said.
The third and final panel, The Future, Part 2, continued the discussion on the future of water in California. Panelists included Susan Kennedy, CEO and board member of Advanced Microgrid Solutions; Arnold Schwarzenegger, 38th governor of California; Lester Snow, executive director of the California Water Foundation; and Kevin Starr, professor at USC. Reiss moderated the panel.
After each panel’s discussion, audience members were invited to ask questions of panelists. Panelists were asked a diverse range of questions, from the vice mayor of Culver City to USC students from the Central Valley.
“It’s incredible to learn firsthand from the policy experts who are directly working on California’s water challenge. It really helps understand the collaboration and innovation required to make progress on critical policy issues, and simplify complex problems into manageable steps,” said Josh Blockstein, a sophomore majoring in biology at USC.
“This event really gives insight into the work that is done behind the scenes that is hard to grasp for students like me who aren’t directly involved on these issues.”

The Pac-12 Championships kicked off on Monday for the USC men’s golf team at Pullman, Washington’s Palouse Ridge Golf Course. After a strong regular season, including first-place finishes at the Bill Cullum Invitational and the Jones Invitational, the Trojans faced off against their conference rivals and surprised many with their impressive showing.
The Pac-12 conference is among the most competitive in NCAA Division I golf. Seven of the programs are ranked within the top 25 in the nation (USC was ranked at No. 13 in the most recent poll), with Arizona State and Oregon ranked the highest at No. 4 and No. 11, respectively. Despite being ranked lower than three of their opponents, the Trojans found themselves leading the field after a round and a half of play. The team recorded a score of 355, good for five-over and second place, through the first 18, but the players truly found their zone during their second go-round of the day.
Senior Eric Sugimoto and freshman Sean Crocker both fired superb 32s through the back nine to start their second round, and the duo’s -3 scores led the team, which recorded a conference-best 8-under through the first nine holes of the second round. Freshman Jonah Texeira and junior Bobby Gojuangco also contributed, both hitting one-under to get USC to -8.
Through 27 holes of play in the Pac-12 Championships, the Trojans were atop the leaderboard after leapfrogging Arizona State who fell behind midway through the second round with a two-under score which was good for only  +2 overall and left them five strokes behind USC. The next closest opponent was California, who sat in third, nine strokes off the pace.
The Pac-12 Championships continue today and will go through Wednesday. Tomorrow’s final round will be broadcast live on the Pac-12 Network.

As we enter the final week of classes, I have mixed feelings about the upcoming months. For most college students, summer means getting a job or an internship and discovering a taste of life after college.
But the beginning of summer means we’re that much closer to the end of summer, which means we’re that much closer to football season. As fellow columnist Jake Davidson noted on April 26, it’s been a while since USC has been the team to beat. I don’t know if this will be the year we reestablish our presence at the top, but I do think it’ll be a great year to be a Trojan fan.
Cody Kessler is returning for his senior season after a breakout junior season. He’s already receiving Heisman buzz, though I’m not here to speculate on that. Sarkisian has a season of experience under his belt and, in addition to Kessler, has JuJu Smith, Adoree’ Jackson, Su’a Cravens and a handful of other returners to make plays. They will be joined by a top-ranked recruiting class with plenty of hype to live up to.
That being said, I think it will be difficult for USC to run the table in 2015. It’s definitely possible, but the Trojans have a fairly strong schedule this year.
The Trojans kick off the season with three home games against Arkansas State, Idaho and Stanford. All of those games should be winnable, but Stanford has taken us to the bitter end for the past two seasons. After what should be a battle against Stanford, the Trojans will hit the road to take on Arizona State.
One of the most heartbreaking losses of last season came at the hands of the Sun Devils, who came from behind to beat USC in the Coliseum with a successful Hail Mary. The Trojans will have to play the rematch on the road, but hopefully the bitterness of last season’s loss will give them the edge to come out and win with a vengeance.
After what should be two trying matchups, the Trojans will return home to host Washington. Washington hasn’t been a problem for the Trojans in the past few seasons, but since Sarkisian left to coach USC, Washington has gained an incredible coach in Chris Petersen, who has the potential to turn the team into a Pac-12 powerhouse.
The Trojans handed the Fighting Irish a handy loss last season at the Coliseum and can likely repeat that performance, but you can never underestimate the power of a rivalry game. This time, USC will have to play in South Bend and face the elements, something they struggled with in the rain at Boston College.
After Notre Dame, the Trojans will face Utah, California, Arizona and Colorado.
Utah stunned USC with a late touchdown to win last season, in yet another late-game collapse by the Trojans. The rematch will be at home this year.
Arizona is another Pac-12 team who almost pulled of a late-game win over USC, but the Trojans were able to hold on for the win. That game will also be at home this year, and hopefully give USC the advantage to pull off a much easier win this time around.
In what is the toughest two weeks of the schedule, USC will close the season against Oregon and UCLA.
Oregon is coming off a season in which they competed for a national title and were led by a Heisman-winning quarterback. Unfortunately for USC, the Trojans will have to play in Eugene, but won’t have to face the NFL-bound Mariota. Still, Oregon is a team that rarely falters, even in what should be its rebuilding years.
The Trojans will return home for the last game of the season to host the crosstown rivalry against UCLA. Jim Mora has led UCLA to the top of the Pac-12, and he and the Bruins have easily put the Trojans away the past two seasons. This season, Kessler and the Trojans certainly have a lot to prove, and with a home-field advantage and two years of embarrassing losses to serve as motivation, I think we can close out the season with a W.
A 12-0 or 12-1 season is certainly no guarantee, but I do think that Sark and Cody have what it takes to take the Trojans back to the top of the Pac-12 and all of college football.
So if you’re like most of my friends and are considering passing up on season tickets this year because “football isn’t your thing” or you just “do it for the tailgate,” please reconsider. There will be plenty of exciting games this year that USC will be on the winning side of. Think Stanford 2013. Trust me, it’s worth it.

No. 13 USC (30-11) looks to regain momentum tonight at Dedeaux Field against the Cal State Fullerton Titans after dropping a disappointing Pac-12 series last weekend against Oregon State.
The Trojans came out with a punch over the weekend behind a strong start from junior Tyler Gilbert, who threw seven complete innings of  four-hit baseball. USC delivered an all-around impressive offensive showing, defeating Oregon State 11-3 during game one of the series.
In game two, the Trojans managed a comeback from a 2-0 deficit during the top of the sixth, but a lead off walk in the bottom of the ninth proved deadly for the Trojans, after pinch hitter Billy King singled through the right side to bring in the game-winning run from third.
The Trojans once again had trouble with consistency on the mound during game three, allowing Oregon State to win the game 9-6. Despite the threat of a major comeback in the top of the ninth as they attempted to crawl out of a 9-4 deficit, they could only produce two more runs in the loss, falling 2-1 in the series.
Tonight, USC looks to shake off last week and start fresh against the visiting Cal State Fullerton Titans. Currently, the Titans hold a 22-20 overall record, an 8-4 record in the Big West Conference and an 8-12 record on the road.
Cal State Fullerton is highlighted at the plate by junior outfielders Josh Vargas, David Olmedo-Barrera and Tyler Steib. The Titans, similarly to the Trojans, have recently transitioned from a very young team to one more experienced, boasting a starting roster of almost all juniors. The Titans are led behind the mound by junior Thomas Eshelman with a 2.10 ERA and junior Justin Garza with a 3.56 ERA.
The Trojans and Titans last met on Feb. 17 in Fullerton where the Trojans came away with the game 6-4. The then-No. 25 Titans were unable to halt the Trojans’ hot streak during the fourth inning as the team put up four more runs to put the game out of reach. Sophomore Bernardo Flores got the win, entering in relief in the fifth to throw three innings, striking out four batters while allowing two runs on three hits with no walks.
Tonight, the Titans will enter the game following a 2-1 series victory at home against UC Irvine.
Reviewing the numbers, USC currently maintains a .297 team batting average compared to CSFU’s .259 average. USC has a 3.13 team ERA, and CSFU holds a 3.38 team ERA.
Statistics aside, USC head coach Dan Hubbs believes the key to tomorrow night’s game remains the same as all season: overall game consistency.
“It’s the same as it always is with us; we need to pitch well and hit well every time we enter a game,” Hubbs said. “I think we pitched extremely well last Friday and pretty well on Saturday. On Sunday we pitched really poorly, and we faced the consequences of that. We just need to play well [tonight] and get back in our rhythm. If we can do that we’ll be in the position to win. We just need to play our game.”
In terms of pitching, the Trojan team has recently had trouble finishing off batters and putting men on bases because of walks, oftentimes to lead off innings. Hubbs believes that minimizing the number of walks will be key to playing clean defense in tonight’s match.
“I think we really need to focus on cutting down on our walks, especially from the guys in the pen but also our starters as well,” Hubbs said. “Some guys will get some work in tomorrow so hopefully that will help straighten them out for the weekend because we can’t keep giving out too many.”
Working in USC’s favor is the fact that the team tends to play very well at home. The Trojans currently hold an 18-6 record at home, a factor that Hubbs hopes will positively influence the team in tonight’s game.
“We always tend to play really well at home, which will hopefully really work in our favor tonight,” Hubbs said. “That being said, we’re going to need to stop them early in order for that to remain an advantage. We need to get ourselves on the board early in the game and then extend. We’ve done a good job of that when we’re at home and we tend to pitch much better at home. I don’t expect tomorrow to be any different.”
The Trojans will host the Titans tonight at 6 p.m. PST at Dedeaux Field. The game will also be broadcast on the Pac-12 Network.

Last week, a reporter asked Chris Evans and Jeremy Renner — two stars of the upcoming Avengers sequel — what they thought about the fact that Black Widow (portrayed by Scarlet Johansson) was hooking up with the Hulk (Mark Ruffalo) rather than either of the fictional characters portrayed by the two men, Captain America or Hawkeye, like so many fans had hoped or expected. The men replied by jokingly calling Black Widow a “slut” and a “whore.” Evans then went on to describe her as a “flirt” who was “leading everyone on.”
Of course, there are gender stereotypes and general issues with the term “slut” and other things the two said, but I think the main culprit in this whole incident is the reporter herself. Why, of all the questions in the universe to ask about the film and the actors, are we discussing Black Widow’s dating patterns? Jeremy Renner has since stated: “I am sorry that this tasteless joke about a fictional character offended anyone.” I have to admit that he’s right in pointing out that the character is completely fictional. To ask the men to comment on her dating life seems a bit superfluous given that she’s not even real and the actors are also neither the screenwriters nor the comic book creators, but it also displays the resounding problem with how Hollywood depicts female superheroes.
For the first several minutes of Black Widow’s introduction in her previous  Marvel film Captain America: Winter Soldier, she skulks upon the deck of a ship and — while punching bad guys out of the way — grills Captain America on his love life. She suggests various prospects he could explore and almost reprimands him for not getting out into the dating scene. Why, I must ask, is this what Black Widow is preoccupied with during her first few moments with Captain America aboard a ship teeming with a bunch of bad guys in the middle of the ocean? Furthermore, why is Black Widow the only woman on the Avengers team?
This topic is by no means new. It seems to me that in the Marvel Universe and the entertainment industry at large, we only have room for one incredible woman at a time, while we have plenty of slots for men to fill to combat crime and become superstars. Besides Black Widow, we have Tony Starks’ girlfriend Pepper Potts and then the tertiary Agent Peggy Carter, who now has her own TV show on ABC. But in terms of film, screen time is relegated to a few brief moments of inciting inspiration for Captain America before he sets off to save the world again. All of the women aforementioned also happen to be skinny, yet somehow voluptuous and devastatingly beautiful. They are undeniable sex objects for the many men around them.
By asking about Black Widow’s love life, the reporter has perpetuated the stereotype that female superheroes are to be sexualized and objectified to the point where the most interesting aspect of their character is not their killer fighting abilities or astounding intellect or — gasp — their anger management issue that’s made acceptable by their superhuman strength, but simply, who she’s shacking up with.
What if we had a superhero in the Marvel mix that was a woman who wore glasses and could code the next life-saving algorithm within a matter of minutes, and the men were attracted to her brains most and not her body? Maybe she doesn’t have fiery red hair that was so perfectly curled and matched her on-point red lipstick or hourglass figure. Or what if they had a woman who also exploded into a mass of muscle at the slightest offense? How would the men label her? A drama queen? Or, maybe even worse, a crazy b-tch?
Though it’s true audience members have DC Comics’ upcoming Wonder Woman film starring Gal Gadot (slated for a 2017 release) to look forward to, even that film has already come with its own set of problems. Most recently, the more than capable director Michelle MacLaren has left the film, citing “creative differences” between herself and the producers. One must wonder, what exactly could those differences be coming from a female director who faced not only a male screenwriter but also a board of seven known producers, only one of whom is a woman (and also happens to be another producers’ wife).
With MacLaren gone, Warner Bros. execs quickly scrambled to find another director, and thankfully kept in line with their original idea of having a woman fill the position. Patty Jenkins, known for her career-starting film Monster starring Charlize Theron, has boarded the project and hopefully will add more to Wonder Woman’s mythology beyond being a brunette bombshell who can fit into a skin-tight golden one piece and thigh high boots. Come on, Patty, I, and possibly millions of other women, am rooting for you.

In superhero movies there is action, the romantic interludes cannot occupy much time. There simply is not enough time to develop more than one relationship in these types of films. The bonding and socializing of men is very different than that of women. It does not take much to have a believable bonding of men in a few short moments. In Reservoir Dogs, the bonding takes place around a table in a  single scene. In Avengers it is also in a single scene.. 
Men and women are different. I like to see attractive women on film and in comic books. The Marvel Universe is populated  with many women. I remember as a teen, a poster entitled, “X-Men Women”. This is fantasy. Men date and marry women that are very different form the ones they view for entertainment.

The western is largely a lost genre. In recent years some directors have gone back to it with films such as Django Unchained, True Grit and The Assasination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford. But, overall, the genre is very underutilized. The prevailing theory is that space adventures — with the 1977 release of Star Wars often called the turning point — have filled the void that westerns used to occupy in our culture’s imagination. Basically, the argument goes, the wild west is no longer as exciting when the whole universe opens up in front of you.
It is sad to think, however, that this long and often quite excellent genre has been all but abandoned by the industry. Slow West, which will be screened at USC on April 28 and will be released in theaters on May 15, is the latest film to show just how ripe the genre still is in the hands of the right team.
Kodi Smit-McPhee, the actor who will play everyone’s favorite blue teleporting mutant in next year’s X-Men: Apocalypse, stars as Jay Cavendish, Slow West’s 16-year-old protagonist who ventures across the pond in a search of his lost love. His clueless attempts to cross the unforgiving frontier are quickly spotted by Michael Fassbender’s Silas, a grizzled drifter, who offers to serve as his guide through the wilderness.
The cast is a delight and both leads play their roles perfectly. Smit-McPhee is infuriating as the entitled and clueless Cavendish. Often you want to reach into the screen and shake some sense into the character for some of the things he says and does. But, do not let this be read as a criticism of Smit-McPhee. Cavendish is supposed to be annoying. As the film eventually makes abundantly clear, his soliloquies about love and being civilized are supposed to be grating.
Fassbender is, of course, perfect in the role as the road-weary cowboy. This is no surprise, as Fassbender is very good at providing a subtle undercurrent of wildness to his characters, a trait that serves him in this role, as well as in his most famous roles including his turns as a scarred master of magnetism, a hollowed-out sex addict and a sadistic slaveowner. Fassbender is stoic, as a proper western hero should be. His quiet demeanor would not be out of place beside Eastwood’s or Wayne’s, but he also is able to evoke the constant danger of a character like Silas. As Eastwood explored in his excellent Oscar-winning film Unforgiven, it takes a certain sort of man to be a successful western outlaw. Silas is that sort of man, thanks to Fassbender.
The rest of the cast is also excellent. Ben Mendelsohn, perhaps best known for his role as the slimy businessman Daggett who Tom Hardy’s Bane predictably betrays and kills halfway through The Dark Knight Rises, is a scene stealer as an old associate of Fassbender’s who ends up as the primary antagonist in the film. He makes for a delicious, determined, villain in an unforgettable fur coat who plays extremely well against Fassbender. In one scene, the two former associates sit down over a bottle of absinthe and make pleasant conversation, but the undercurrent of aggression and alertness between the two jumps off the screen. Performances like these from Mendelsohn make the prospect of his rumored casting in Star Wars: Rogue One all the sweeter. Finally, though she has precious little screen time, Caren Pistorius is quite good as the object of Jay Cavendish’s affections, Rose Ross. Her performance in the climactic scene makes one hope she gets larger roles in the future.
Director John Maclean makes his feature film debut in style. His shots are often daring and showcases the vastness and beauty of the “American” plains — the film was shot largely in New Zealand — while turning around and making the urgency of the action pop. It is an impressive debut.
Finally, perhaps the very best part of the film, no small feat in a film with excellent acting and directing, has to be the script. Written by the director Maclean, Slow West manages to do something that very few films manage to do anymore. That is to be truly unpredictable. The ending is, simply put, shocking. It is, however, shocking in the best way. None of the twists feel manufactured. They feel like they arose organically from the story. This is quite the balancing act, and it is a testament to Maclean that he was able to make it work. Beyond the plot, however, the writing still shines. There are moments of comedy peppered throughout the story which bring the otherwise dull trek across the plains plenty of life. A scene where the two travelers happen upon the body of a foolish lumberjack who crushed himself under the tree he was cutting comes to mind. The scene before them is objectively horrifying, it is a dead body, but in the context of the story it is nothing short of hilarious. The film manages to hit notes of despair and comedy in quick succession. It is really quite impressive.
It would be foolish to think — nor would it be a good thing — that a movie like Slow West could hope to turn the tide and have westerns push aside space adventures to take their place in the film landscape. It would be delightful, however, if a great movie such as this would encourage other directors to revisit this once proud canvas for silver screen treats.

On May 5, author Peter Schweizer will release his new book Clinton Cash: The Untold Story of How and Why Foreign Governments and Business Helped Make Bill and Hillary Rich.
Schweizer told ABC in an interview that his book exposes 12 incidents in which Hillary Clinton was giving governmental power to those who gave money to her foundation or her husband. Naturally, the Clinton campaign is calling all of the alleged instances a coincidence. Media outlets have led their own investigations on some of the leaked claims, with some calling the situation a scandal and others calling it baseless.
Discovering the truth of these claims is important from a legal perspective, particularly if it turns out that Clinton did anything illegal. As far as Clinton’s campaign is concerned, however, it doesn’t matter if the allegations are true or not.
The Clinton campaign advertises her as the tried and true candidate, but according to one poll, a majority of Americans believe she is untrustworthy. A Quinnipiac University poll indicates that 54 percent of Americans believe Clinton is not honest.
America’s distrust of Clinton should not be much of a surprise to the campaign; the Clinton family legacy is littered with scandal. Bill Clinton faced extramarital affairs, avoiding the draft, Whitewater, illegal campaign contributions and finally, impeachment. Clinton was wrapped up in her husband’s affairs, but she has also faced her own in the past couple years.
The committee hearings regarding Clinton’s private email and Benghazi have yet to take place, but Clinton is set to testify the week of May 18, right around the time when she will give a larger-scale campaign announcement speech. Perhaps the Clinton campaign was hoping that this date would mean the end of scandal for her, and she could claim a clear conscious in her speech.
If Clinton history tells us anything, however, Benghazi and personal emails will just be the start of a long list of controversy to be associated with this campaign.
Clinton Cash is already causing controversy and it hasn’t even been released yet. Though some of the claims, such as whether any policy was changed in favor of donors, might be dismissed upon further investigation, what cannot be dismissed is the immense wealth the Clintons have amassed since Bill left office. While exact numbers aren’t known, some estimate that the Clintons are worth between $100 and $200 million dollars. Bill Clinton runs away with hundreds of thousands of dollars per paid speech, and the majority of that money comes from foreign speeches. As of June 2014, Bill had made $56.3 million from foreign speeches alone. That mass of foreign money doesn’t fit with Clinton’s “champion of the everyday American” narrative.
The media has already labeled the book as “another Clinton scandal,” which could be enough to tip those who weren’t so sure about Clinton over the edge. If nothing else, the scandal will remind Americans exactly how wealthy the Clinton family is. If the book prompts any further investigation, Clinton Cash could go further and destroy her campaign altogether. For now, Clinton needs to be careful with what she denies. America eventually found out about her husband’s sexual relations with that woman, and the last thing Clinton needs is an incriminating sound bite of her own.

The Clintons are exhibit one of people that are rich that can’t leave other people alone. Without the power of government they do not have power over other people’s lives. With the power of government, they have the force of millions of employees, soldiers and trillions of dollars to harass people.

Two weeks after her announcement to run for president in 2016, Hillary Clinton has found herself embroiled in yet another controversy. This time, rather than examining the email habits of the former secretary of state, it concerns the Clinton Foundation and the allocation of received donations. According to a forthcoming book by Stanford professor Peter Schweizer, the Clinton family might have given governmental favors to benefactors of the foundation. Schweizer also addressed the Clinton’s lucrative name and funds generated from questionable means.
Though the book, titled Clinton Cash: The Untold Story of How and Why Foreign Governments and Business Helped Make Bill and Hillary Rich has been deemed by The New York Times as “the most anticipated and feared book of a presidential cycle still in its infancy,” the quid pro quo allegations will not faze the campaign. Rather, it gives Clinton a chance to change her narrative and become more relatable to the public.
It is imperative to first note Schweizer’s background, which reveals his bias against Clinton. Schweizer’s past jobs include a position on former President George W. Bush’s speech-writing team. He has attacked liberals in general in his books, calling them the “Architects of Ruin.” Currently, Schweizer is a senior editor-at-large at Breitbart News, a conservative outlet. Obviously, Schweizer holds views opposite to those of Clinton, so his adversarial accounts are made to fulfill his own political wishes. Even if his claims are based upon true accounts, it doesn’t change the fact that Schweizer’s stance is firmly rooted in conservative politics. Political attacks are inevitable, and Schweizer’s crusade is just one of the many battles Clinton will effortlessly endure.
Of any antagonistic movements that are thrown her way, Clinton said, “It is, I think, worth nothing that the Republicans seem to only be talking about me. I don’t know what they would talk about if I wasn’t in the race. But I am in the race and hopefully we will get onto the issues and I look forward to that.” Indeed, it seems that Clinton is fully prepared to thwart all claims by detractors like Schweizer. As her team has pointed out, Schweizer’s findings are not revolutionary, as two books from 2007 have also reported the same revelations. The Republican Party will not get ahead by bashing Clinton on these sensational claims.
Schweizer’s investigations point out one relevant thing — Clinton is not the average, blue-collar American. The Clintons have raked in $136.5 million from 2001 to 2012, with a large sum of money generated from former President Bill Clinton’s foreign addresses. Going forward, Clinton must change her story to appeal more to the Americans without that kind of money.
Ultimately, this incident will not encourage constituents to turn away from Clinton in the upcoming election. Allegations that the Clintons’ foundation has directed donations toward other agendas is already old news and not unique to just the Clinton’s campaign. Additionally, Schweizer, probed by his personal biases, cannot fully discredit Clinton who has successfully overseen the United States as a first lady, senator and secretary of state.
America is ready for Hillary, and people like Peter Schweizer are not going to stop her.

ethics simply does not mean anything in this day and age…the Clintons are all about the Clintons.  The country cannot afford another run by them.  Benghazi happened while Hillary was Sec of State and the ambassador was left to die despite requests for more security…the spin eventually will stop at the right door step and would happen sooner if the media would simply do their job, report the news not try to be the news.
will the campaign survive? yes, i agree with you.  but don’t you care AT ALL about this issue or do you think its okay for a non-profit charity that only donates 10% to charity to receive money for favors from foreign governments?  do you care that Hillary destroyed emails from God only knows that probably related to the foundation?  well, you SHOULD.  those emails were YOURS, MINE, and every other American’s and she destroyed them.  using a position of power to raise money for yourself and to garner favor for foreign mystery people…you’re fine with that?  or do you just not want to talk about that – since this country is ready for her?  i believe in an America of laws – and many have been broken – but i guess its okay with you, and you’re ready for that.
Again, voting for an individual based on the color of their skin or sex, for one without qualifications is destructive to the future of our country. She will likely be the Dem  ominee, however, if folks would do a 5 minute Google search on the a Clintons they’ll discover that they are about as ethical as a mobster.
You are correct, a single reporter is not going to stop anyone. However, the public can. Looking at HRC. Is this the person that deserves and will execute faithfully the office of the presidency? I venture to say that Chelsea is just as qualified and ready as Hillary for the office of the presidency. Moreover, I would say that Chelsea has fewer public disappointments and ethical challenges.

USC Vice Provost for Information Technology Services and Chief Information Officer Peter Siegel resigned from his position Monday, effective immediately.
In a memorandum to the USC community, Provost and Senior Vice President for Academic Affairs Michael Quick announced Siegel was stepping down and lauded him for his work at the university.
“His leadership helped propel USC’s Information Technology Services (ITS) department forward in vital ways through his commitment to enhancing cybersecurity and network infrastructure,” Quick wrote in the memorandum. “Vice Provost Siegel worked to stabilize key administrative functions by centralizing systems for human resources, finance, and research administration. “
Siegel was also recognized for his emphasis on risk management and garnering “effective communication” between ITS and academic and administrative units. He originally joined USC in July 2013. Previously, he served as the CIO and vice provost for Information and Educational Technology at the University of California, Davis.
The memo did not specifically state Siegel’s reasons for leaving, but Quick encouraged the university community to “[wish] Peter well as he tackles his next big challenge.” Quick’s office would not make further comment on Siegel’s plans.
In his place, Douglas Shook has been appointed interim vice provost for ITS and CIO, effective May 1. Shook currently serves as the dean of academic records and registrar and chief technology officer for enrollment services. His role as registrar will be filled by Frank Chang, who is currently the associate registrar at the office of the registrar.
Katharine Harrington, vice president of admissions and planning, will assume the additional role of dean of academic records. Quick mentioned that the appointment of an advisory search committee will soon be announced. The offices of Shook, Chang and Harrington were not available for comment as of end of business day Monday.
“This position is crucial to building a robust information system that can serve the needs of the university for years to come and bolstering USC’s role as a leading private research university committed to the public good,” Quick wrote.
Hopefully this will help align USC toward forging its own digital technology destiny, based on student and faculty needs and not those of systems administrators and IT managers.
