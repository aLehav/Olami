Behind 40 combined points from senior shooting guard Aliyah Mazyck and junior guard Minyon Moore Sunday at Walter Pyramid, the women’s basketball team improved to 2-0 after defeating Long Beach State 86-50.
Mazyck scored 17 of her 19 points in the first half, shooting 6-of-9 from the field and 4-of-6 from beyond-the-arc. Mazyck finished the game with 26 minutes, 19 points and four rebounds. 
Moore was 4-of-4 from the field for 10 points in the first half, including 2 points from the free throw line. The junior guard finished with 21 points in 32 minutes, leading all scorers. She also added seven rebounds, seven assists and four steals to her total. 
“[Minyon] has an elite skill, and that skill is playing hard,” head coach Mark Trakh said. “She gets after it, she rebounds defends, scores at a high rate … She’s an overall great player.”
The Trojans had some solid performances off the bench. Redshirt sophomore forward Asiah Jones  did not wait long to get her college career started. Coming off her first career college game where she scored 4 points with five rebounds, Jones showed improvement by leading all non-starters in minutes, points and rebounds with 18, 9 and six, respectively. In addition, senior Cheyanne Wallace went 5-of-8 at the free throw line. Wallace finished with 5 points in 16 minutes.
The Trojans began the game fast, scoring 8 straight points before giving up a 3-pointer to sophomore Naomi Hunt three minutes into the game. The Trojans finished the first quarter with a 23-8 run that extended to a 31-9 run four minutes into the second quarter. USC finished a dominant half shooting 60 percent from the field, taking a commanding 51-22 lead at halftime.
“In the first half we focused … we’re executing our offense, we really focused on our defense. So the first half gets an A-plus,” Trakh said. “But we lost our focus, we lost our discipline in the third quarter. We started making mistakes on defense, and made some mistakes on offense … We need to be focused for 40 minutes not 20.”
After a trip to the charity stripe by Wallace in the third quarter, the Women of Troy extended their lead to 37, the greatest margin of the night. USC dominated the post with 38 total points in the paint while out-rebounding the 49ers 50-24. Minyon and senior guard Mariya Moore combined for 16 boards on the night. The Trojans also scored 33 points off Long Beach State’s 24 turnovers, another testament to Trakh’s philosophy of taking advantage of turnovers.
“[My philosophy first comes from] our defense, we do a good job of forcing turnovers,” Trakh said. “I expect that to continue, we have some kids who can defend and I expect that to continue.”
With only two games under their belt, the Trojans have shown what they are capable of, having outscored opponents 159-105 so far.
Freshman guard Justina King led Long Beach State with 12 points and five assists in 39 minutes of play. Junior guard Sydney Bordonaro led all bench players for the 49ers, scoring 12 points on two 3-pointers and four free throws in 15 minutes.
The Trojans look to extend their undefeated record when they return to Galen Center for two home games. They will face UC Santa Barbara Thursday at 7 p.m., and Santa Clara University Sunday at 2 p.m.

Freshman guard Kevin Porter prepares to drive to the basket in the Trojans’ game against Vanderbilt Sunday. (Ling Luo | Daily Trojan)
Close games can be decided by any number of factors, but men’s basketball head coach Andy Enfield felt that his team’s 82-78 loss to Vanderbilt on Sunday at the Galen Center came down to two things: timing and player availability.
“I thought our players played hard; it was a good college basketball game,” Enfield said. “Unfortunately we didn’t make the plays down the stretch. We fought back and took the lead, and then we had some crucial turnovers and missed shots.”
The Trojans had their opportunities to win the game, leading 69-67 with just over three minutes left. But the Commodores emerged victorious because they executed, mainly at the free throw line. Vanderbilt made 11-of-12 from the charity stripe over the last three minutes. The Trojans were forced to play catch-up, and came up just short.
It didn’t help that USC was behind the eight ball for much of the night due to foul trouble. The Trojans had 26 personal fouls for the game, granting the Commodores 30 free throw attempts. Two of USC’s four leading scorers, freshman guard Kevin Porter and sophomore forward Jordan Usher, fouled out. 
As Enfield pointed out, this wouldn’t be as much of an issue if the team wasn’t missing key contributors to injuries; senior forward Bennie Boatwright missed his second straight game while recovering from a knee injury and freshman guard Elijah Weaver has yet to return from a late August ankle surgery.
Although both are expected to return soon, their absence may have cost the Trojans a potential resume-building win for the NCAA Tournament against a talented Vanderbilt team.
“We got better today. We’re not at full strength,” said junior big man Nick Rakocevic, who compiled 19 points and 18 rebounds. “If we had Boatwright and Weaver, tonight would be a different story.”
The Trojans still could have won this game if they had performed better on the defensive boards. Vanderbilt had 19 offensive rebounds which they turned into 22 second chance points. The Trojans matched with 21 offensive rebounds and 18 second chance points of their own, but every extra opportunity they gave the Commodores put them at more of a disadvantage.
The Commodores had a freshman duo in guard Darius Garland and big man Simisola Shittu, a pairing that put Vanderbilt in position to win. Shittu was a menace in the paint, piling up eight offensive rebounds and 14 points. USC struggled to keep Garland out of the paint, and he led the Commodores with 19 points.
“[Vanderbilt’s freshmen] are extremely talented, they are great athletes,” Enfield said.
Porter carried the Trojan offense in the first half, pouring in 12 of his 14 points for the game. He continued to show his propensity for highlight plays, with multiple dunks and shifty isolation moves in the first half. When the Trojans struggled to get open shots against a stingy Vanderbilt defense early on, Porter entered and created offense by himself.
Porter played for a few minutes in the second half due to foul issues, but his teammates picked up the slack. USC got to the basket repeatedly on an 11-3 run to take a 47-45 lead early in the frame. The Trojans weren’t necessarily efficient on these looks, but the pressure on the basket drew Vanderbilt’s interior defenders and allowed easy putbacks. 
“I was trying to force the pressure, push and break down the defense, find the open guy or hit the open shot,” said redshirt junior Derryck Thornton, who had 17 points and helped key the run with his dribble penetration.
USC also played better defense in the second half, forcing Garland into six turnovers.
“I was impressed with our effort. We played hard,” Enfield said. “We turned up the defense in the second half and limited their second shots.”
However, the Trojans fell just short due to some missed opportunities at the end of the game. Thornton struggled with an ugly turnover when the game was tied at 69 and a missed free throw that could have brought the Trojans within 1 point with 14 seconds left.
“Executing and being poised [is what USC needed down the stretch]. A lot of that falls on me as the point guard, get everyone to stay calm,” Thornton said. “We could’ve done a better job settling down and getting the shots coach wanted.”
The Trojans are 1-1 on the season and will host Stetson Wednesday 7 p.m. at Galen Center.

Sophomore outside hitter Brooke Botkin leaps for the kill in the Trojans’ loss to Washington Thursday. (Sunny Dong | Daily Trojan)
The No. 13 USC women’s volleyball team moved into sole possession of second place in the Pac-12 over the weekend, answering a loss to No. 25 Washington with a victory over No. 19 Washington State. 
The Trojans dropped a four-set match to the Huskies on Thursday, but came out on top in four sets against the Cougars Sunday afternoon.
The Women of Troy were left without several starters for both matches, including junior outside hitter Khalia Lanier and sophomore outside hitter Brooke Botkin, who were both under concussion protocol.
Junior outside hitter Emily Baptista led the team against Washington with 24 kills and 18 digs. The Trojans hit .262 in the loss.
The Women of Troy were in a better place by Sunday. Senior libero Victoria Garrick had 24 digs for the Women of Troy. Baptista again led the way with 17 more kills, and credited her teammates for setting her up for success throughout the match. 
“I’ve got to give it to the passers,” Baptista said after Sunday’s match. “I think our passing was pretty great [and] allowed our setter to move the ball around so the blockers weren’t always on me. I think our defense and passing were really great so that allowed for me to get a lot of kills today.”
 Sunday’s Trojans looked like an entirely different team than the one that fell to Washington State earlier this season in a five-set road loss in mid-October. The team remembered that match when it faced off against the Cougars for the second time Sunday Baptista said.
“We were really motivated this game since the last time we played them was a heartbreaker,” Baptista said. “Even though we’re missing a couple players, we [said] ‘OK, we’re going to play for revenge, we’re going to play for the people that aren’t able to be with us right now.’”
 Baptista said the victory will be important for the team’s confidence moving forward, considering how short-handed the squad was against the Cougars.
“We’re missing a few girls, and all three of them are starters, so I think it gives us a lot of confidence that we can be a very good team — that we can beat ranked teams like Washington State — with girls who don’t normally play,” Baptista said. “That gives us a lot of confidence for [the] rest of the season.”
The Trojans took a commanding 2-0 set lead with a pair of 25-18 wins before dropping the third set 25-22, but finished the deal with a fourth-set victory of the same score.
“[Winning the first set] is a big deal,” head coach Brent Crouch said. “We’ve been talking about that for a few weeks, about coming out really strong. ‘Announcing ourselves’ has been kind of a phrase we’ve been talking about a lot. We came out swinging.”
Crouch echoed Baptista’s sentiments about the importance of the victory, which helped the Trojans’ confidence. USC only has four regular season matches — and only one at the Galen Center — until playoffs begin. 
“We’re missing half our starting lineup,” Crouch said. “Getting some new experience is great heading into the tournament. And the people that are hurt — it may not be the end of the world for them just to get some rest right now … It’s just a really good team bonding, team culture experience because everyone is getting to play now.” 
For the most part, the Trojans survived missing a few starters. The Cougars’ late comeback attempt ultimately failed, but the Trojans didn’t waltz to the finish line.
“We didn’t overcome [the injuries] very much in the last two sets, but the first two we did a nice job — we passed pretty well,” Crouch said. “The last two sets, that’s where we really missed [the injured players] — when we’re not passing real well, they’re still able to get us kills, and when we started passing off the net in the third and fourth sets [we were] not able to get kills.”
The team focused on defense in the  days leading up to the Washington State match. The Trojans proved themselves by holding the Cougars to a .098 hitting percentage, compared to a .193 percentage for USC. The Women of Troy had 12 blocks in the match.  
“That ended up being the difference,” Crouch said of the defense. “You don’t have to do a lot of offense if you’re doing that.” 
The Trojans will head to Arizona this weekend for a Friday match against No. 20 Arizona and a Sunday contest with Arizona State.

Josh Dunst | Daily Trojan
For the second straight home game, the football team not only managed to lose, but also did so in truly embarrassing fashion. 
While the concept of what is “embarrassing” has been defined and redefined countless times this season, Saturday’s 15-14 loss to Cal was truly a new low for USC.
A Week 2 loss to Stanford, in which the Trojans managed just 3 points against a Stanford defense that would go on to allow 40 points at home to Utah and Washington State, was embarrassing. 
Seeing a 14-3 lead turn into a 37-14 loss to the Texas Longhorns was embarrassing. 
Allowing Arizona to come back to nearly beat the Trojans after USC committed 18 penalties accounting for nearly 170 yards was embarrassing. 
Dropping back-to-back divisional games to Utah and Arizona State to not only eliminate the stranglehold on the Pac-12 South but also wipe out a 19-game home winning streak was embarrassing.
This week, the Trojans lost to a Golden Bears squad that has been winless against USC in its last 14 attempts and hasn’t won in the Coliseum since 2000. The loss firmly eliminates USC from Pac-12 South contention, and also brings the team to a point where they will more than likely fail to qualify for bowl season if they cannot handle business in the Rose Bowl against UCLA. It would be the first time since 2011 and the third time this century that the Trojans would fail to make it to postseason play. 
Put lightly, this is extremely disappointing for a team that has made it to two consecutive New Years’ Six bowls, won the conference a year ago and has had recruiting classes ranked no lower than 10th over the past four years. 
Put harshly, yet realistically, this is completely unacceptable from any USC team — and heads need to roll.
While head coach Clay Helton may not be the single cause for USC’s failures, Saturday’s defeat made it clear that the team’s problems may be much more deep-rooted than an ineffective offense. In the waning moments of the weekend’s contest, a season defining moment for the Trojans came when senior cornerback Iman Marshall took a 15-yard penalty for taunting the Golden Bears bench, allowing Cal to ice the win.
On one hand, Marshall certainly has to be more concentrated on the game at hand. As a senior leader and the best player on the Trojan defense by most metrics, he must set a better example for the rest of the unit. At the same time, just as much of the blame falls on Helton and the tone of the program.
At this point, it is clear that USC is not entirely focused on winning or even being a competitive team. This version of USC football is essentially a professional development program for players to make their name known, gain scouts’ attention and get drafted. In some ways, that is alright. 
If players will continue to be left without proper compensation for their work here in college, then what should prevent them from doing all they can to get paid as handsomely as professionals? 
The problem, however, lies in Helton’s desire to do both. When a leader like Marshall makes a selfish decision, it becomes clear that this team simply isn’t focused on winning. When Helton pleads to officials, “please don’t call that penalty” with a look of pure desperation and terror in his eyes, it becomes clear he hasn’t prepared himself or his players to compete.
With every passing moment, the fanbase becomes more impatient, recruits become more indecisive and veteran players continue to wonder why they would stick around a program that will not help them win or get paid like they can in the NFL. 
Again, it is up to Athletic Director Lynn Swann to make the tough decisions. Again, USC looks like a team that is directionless, leaderless and simply waiting on the next miracle player (see: Sam Darnold) to come around and save it. This team must perform better than it has all season. This program must have higher expectations. If this isn’t enough of a catalyst for change, then it’s possible that nothing will be.

The Los Angeles Coffee Festival featured coffee tastings by national and international vendors, and interactive showings including a D.I.Y. coffee body scrub bar (right). The festival ran from Nov. 9 to 11 at the Reef L.A. in Downtown. (Maansi Manchanda | Daily Trojan)
It’s not everyday that the average Angeleno can walk into a space with movies, history lessons and lectures about coffee. From Friday to Sunday, The Reef L.A. hosted the first-ever Los Angeles Coffee Festival, drawing a crowd with varying stakes in the industry. 
Despite apprehensions of a lack of local representation, L.A. showed up to its own festival; vendors like Cognoscenti Coffee, Loit Cafe and  Good People Coffee Co. filled each exhibition space with the aroma of freshly brewed coffee. 
International vendors, such as Teapigs and Milkadamia, also made the trip with hope of making names for themselves in the American coffee scene.
Along with the coffee, a variety of tea, milk and appliance vendors were at the festival. 
One of the festival’s main sponsors, Califa Farms, sprawled out in  a larger exhibition space, decorating it with hanging plants and featuring a
D.I.Y. coffee body scrub bar, where attendees could fill mason jars with combinations of coffee and brown sugar exfoliants and top them with essential oils to take home. 
Silk, known for producing soy and alternative milk products, filled its exhibition space with picnic-style tables and a bar to present its barista collection — pairing cold brews from other vendors with Silk samples to hand out.
Appliance vendors like Bodum, FAEMA and Breville showcased their appliances designed specifically for baristas and cafe owners. The baristas at the Breville booth served up slices of pizza as well as espresso, with
proceeds going to the festival’s partner charity, Project Waterfall. Many
over-caffeinated visitors stopped into their small faux grass plot to sit down and munch on what was the only food amid of coffee booths.
USC locale Nature’s Brew was also represented by Unity, a New York
City-based roaster that provides beans used in Nature’s Brew beverages. Adam Strauss, co-founder and head of the L.A. Unity branch chatted with passersby about the growers and farms that Unity has relationships with.
“We emphasize our relationships with the farmers,” Strauss said. “There’s this one guy in Colombia [and it] takes two weeks just to get to his farm — and it’s by horseback — but we do it. Fostering those personal relationships, that’s what it’s about.”
Students who frequent Nature’s Brew can look forward to Unity’s Caturra beans, which are used in the shop’s cold brew. This year, Unity is roasting Ethiopian-sourced Kossa Geshe, and will introduce Colombian-sourced beans next year.
“The farm [the Caturra is from] is called Laderas Del Tapias,” Strass said in an interview with the Daily Trojan. “That’s a farm we’ve been buying from for four harvests.”
THE LAB
A presentation room just off to the side of the exhibition room featured talks themed around coffee and related industries, and also rooted in social and environmental issues. Adam Carr of Seven Miles Coffee Roasters kicked off Friday’s presentations with his talk “Environmental Sustainability in Cafes: Cradle to Grave Analysis,” setting the bar for each half-hour slot with an energetic examination of the possibilities of environmental protection in this industry.
Two educators from Stumptown Coffee Roasters, Kristi Persinger and Erica Shafer, discussed the ways we can support women and the underexposed gender divide within the industry in their talk, “Women in Coffee.” From the beginnings of female coffee makers’ contributions — like Melitta Bentz’s invention of the paper coffee filter in 1908 — to today’s women taking charge of farms, winning competitions and starting their own businesses, Persinger and Shafer also provided a quick but thorough overview of the history of women in the coffee industry.
Saturday featured eight speakers while Sunday saw only five, all of whom tackled a different aspect in the coffee and tea industries most would not stop to think about — from historical roots in colonialism to how roasters use data  analysis to better their brews.
THE TASTING ROOM
The Tasting Room, a more intimate space fitted with two long wooden tables, allowed guests to share cups of joe and conversation.
Friday started off with the Art of Tea 101, a historical look into tea and its background. Despite speaking at a coffee festival, Art of Tea CEO Steve Schwartz sat at the table and expressed the importance of tea in society today, particularly among the younger demographic.
“Millennials are becoming more and more into coffee, but tea just as equally,” Schwartz said. “Because of the Boston Tea Party, we [as Americans] shy away from tea, but it’s really a central part of our culture.”
He said he was surprised to find many vendors and visitors were international, and spoke about tea’s role in each of their cultures. The majority of the Tasting Room sessions were centered on tea rather than coffee, a break from the focus of the main room. 
In addition to the panels, talks and exhibition booths, parts of the main area served as spaces for events like Latte Art Live and Coffee Mixologists L.A. Allstars, featuring baristas and bartenders serving up beautiful designs of cream on espresso in the festival’s early hours and mixing up deceptively tasty concoctions in the afternoon. 
The Coffee Art Project submissions adorned a far wall — entries included a scene from sitcom “Friends” constructed entirely out of coffee beans; paintings of strangers sharing cups of coffee fittingly represented the coffee theme, and many had already been purchased by the second day of the festival. In another room, movie submissions to the Coffee Movie Project were screened throughout the day, with films centered on coffee. 
As the weekend came to a close, attendees walked away from the festival dizzied from an excess of caffeine, yet brimming with new skills and a more holistic view and appreciation of an industry that comprises a daily ritual for many.

Last week, the Nov. 6 midterm elections consumed the news, and it was nearly impossible to find a screen that didn’t feature any political content.
For once, Twitter, Facebook, Instagram and Snapchat served a purpose aside from broadcasting personal content intended to garner meaningless likes and validation. Even if a user was mindlessly scrolling through their social media, they would receive politically relevant material. A shocker, I know.
Considering the mass amount of social media engagement on content about the election, people were more aware and proactive about voting than ever before. Yes, social media activism may have, in fact, played a strong role in encouraging voters, especially younger ones, to get to the polls and have their voices heard.
Historically, midterm elections tend to receive less attention in the public and news media, resulting in lower voter turnout than presidential elections. In the 2014 midterms, eligible voter turnout was a dismal 36.7 percent, compared to the presidential election’s 60.2 percent. The recent 2018 midterms, however, saw more than a 47 percent voter turnout, according to early estimates from the United States Election Project. That’s the highest midterm turnout in over 50 years, nearly rivaling the 49 percent record set in the 1966 midterms.
Most notably, youth voters typically exhibit the worst turnout rates, but this midterm election cycle saw hope for a rising generation of political activists. An estimated 31 percent of voters aged 18-29 cast their ballots in 2018, compared with 21 percent in 2014, according to an exit poll conducted by Tufts University.
As this nail-biting election came down to the wire, social media became the thing to watch.
As digital platforms have grown over the last decade, each election cycle has seen increased use of varying social platforms for campaigning and voter advocacy. Sure, front lawn signs and television advertisements continue to play traditiona roles in campaigns, but with the average person spending over two hours a day on social media, the digital space undoubtedly is a strategic place to reach young voters.
Looking back, social media became the hotspot for political discourse in 2016. Between President Donald Trump’s infamous tweets and Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton’s painful attempt to relate to millenial voters, everyone seemed to jump at the opportunity to make a political comment via tweets, memes and Facebook posts.
Since the controversial events following Trumps’ election, the climate surrounding social media activism has seen a dramatic shift. Instead of simply engaging in online political content and calling it a day, young voters realized they actually have to mobilize to the polls if they want to see change.
As Nov. 6 neared, I could not log on to any social media platform without coming across a post related to the midterms.
Beyond celebrity endorsements — like the “Taylor Swift effect” that saw 160,000 newly registered voters within 48 hours after the singer backed Democrats via an Instagram post — my timeline was filled with peers encouraging one another to vote. Posting about early voting, voting at the polls, “I Voted” stickers, proposition endorsements, you name it: young voters found a way to make voting aesthetically pleasing for a good social media post. Of course, I already planned on voting, but seeing so many of the people I follow participating in their civic duty made me all the more excited to cast my vote, especially since I would get to make a post about it, too.
However, even with an increase in youth voter turnout, online trends cannot always predict election results.
Namely, candidates like Democrat Beto O’Rourke, who ran to represent Texas in the U.S. Senate, gained a large social media following for his progressive nature and youthful appeal. Even Beyoncé sported a “Beto for Senate” hat on Instagram hours before the polls closed.
Based on the outpouring of support for O’Rourke online, many assumed he was a shoo-in for the Senate, but he ended up losing to incumbent Ted Cruz narrowly. Nonetheless, O’Rourke’s active presence on social media helped draw the largest midterm election voter turnout in decades, which is a significant step in the right direction.
One week ago today, I sat on the edge of my seat on the third floor of Wallis Annenberg Hall as I watched the results poor in from one of the most important midterm elections in my lifetime. The building was packed full of similarly anxious onlookers, with many letting out cheers or boos in response to live updates. Though I left Annenberg Hall with mixed feelings (especially toward my home state of Florida’s unpredictability), I felt empowered because I was surrounded by so many peers who were eager to partake in changing our country for the better. I’m ecstatic that social media is finally playing a legitimate role in this process.
Up next for young voters: It’s time to start tweeting about #2020.

Melodramatic metal · Architects’ latest record “Holy Hell” was released on Nov. 9 after a two-year break. (Photo courtesy of Epitaph)
British metalcore band Architects is back with its eighth studio album “Holy Hell,” following a two-year hiatus. 
Written after the band lost guitarist and founding member Tom Searle to skin cancer, the album reflects on pain, grief and overcoming obstacles in a grueling and guttural project. Unfortunately, the album buries itself in the conventions of its genre and fails to feel truly original. 
“Holy Hell” cranks up the intensity from the opening notes of its first track “Death is Not Defeat.” The crunching guitars and drums hammer the hook with explosive force. Vocalist Sam Carter grates against the heavy production with growling vocals that cut through the track.
“I’ll dismantle piece by piece / And I will know that death is not defeat,” Carter belts. His voice is heavy with emotion and desperation, making it clear that he’s attempting to persevere in dire circumstances. 
The best moments on the album come when the band adds different textures to the aggressive production. The title track “Holy Hell” accomplishes this through looped strings that hold the track together within chaotic guitar work. 
“Royal Beggars” mixes things up with pronounced synths layered over the verses. Carter shows off clean vocals in these moments, offering a temporary break from the torrent of shouts peppering the album.
Unfortunately, these instants are few and far between. “Holy Hell” is often bogged down by the usual pitfalls of the metalcore genre. Breakdowns come where expected; guitars crash in and fill out the track with a seemingly identical progression each time; and Carter screams into the void, raging against an unidentified force that tries to stifle him. 
Repetitive lyricism plagues the album’s creative quality. Carter frequently yells about overcoming struggles or dealing with pain, but this constant theme is not delivered with enough nuance, framing or variety. Instead, the listener has to withstand over 42 minutes of anger hashed out in different refrains. 
Even three songs in, the lyrics begin to feel whiny, melodramatic and drawn-out — and the use of ridiculous metaphors doesn’t help. The dark and moody production choices drown each track in the same brooding atmosphere, making them difficult to distinguish at times.
Take, for example, the chorus on “Royal Beggars”: “Overflowing with rage, but we still obey / ‘cause we’re asleep in a hurricane.” With the grinding guitars and strings, lines like this  one come off as overdone and silly for a band as seasoned as Architects.
“Doomsday” features the phrase, “And when the night gives way / it’s like a brand new doomsday.” Too often, Architects’ lyrics are riddled with platitudes that do not serve a creative focus, aside from working as an incorporated, edgy title track.  
Despite these nagging issues, “Holy Hell” is a solid addition to the group’s discography. It has enough energy to be a riveting listen in small chunks or for motivational purposes. 
Architects does not reinvent the wheel with this album, but has created a work that’s cohesive and listenable, which might be good enough this time around.

In late October, Cheddar, a relatively new media company, acquired Rate My Professors, a website that allows students to rate their instructors anonymously. 
The web service’s acquisition marks the perfect opportunity for alterations. The site, while helpful, is biased and should not be trusted in its current state.
Although the site can be an undeniably helpful tool for some quick research on professors and classes, it requires numerous systematic changes to better assist the students who use it. As the tool becomes highly used, the system should be amended to be more objective and less biased by emphasizing the distinction between professors as individuals and as instructors.
College students from over 7,500 universities in the U.S., Canada and the United Kingdom are well-acquainted with Rate My Professors. As USC students register for Spring 2019 courses, many are turning to the website for various rating metrics — quality, difficulty, attendance policy and others — to aid in their course choices.
A crucial aspect of the website is that reviewers are able to maintain anonymity, which theoretically allows students to be honest without fear of repercussion; however, anonymity has several drawbacks, including the fact that individuals have no accountability for what they say online. As such, students who may not have had a particular professor or taken a certain course still have the ability to leave reviews, and students can even leave multiple reviews for an instructor. Though this is not possible if it stems from the same IP address, users with multiple electronic devices and IP addresses can easily skew the rating.
There are also considerable disparities in the reviews that are left for the same professors. On the page of a professor at the School of Cinematic Arts, one student warns, “Get ready to die. You will be stressed if you take the course,” while another praises the class as “Very inspirational. Learned more in this class than any other class I took last semester.” The voluntary response bias, which overrepresents strongly opinionated individuals, also explains why there is such a large disparity; the individuals most likely to leave responses clearly have strong opinions about the instructor and their course, though those opinions may not be uniform. 
Perhaps the biggest problem with the website is that it reduces individual instructors into mere numbers, removing the human aspects of teaching that are difficult to quantify. 
The inseparability of professors as people and as professionals is exemplified by the “hotness” rating, a category that existed on Rate My Professors until July 2018. A 2017 study by  “Assessment & Evaluation in Higher Education” found that professors who were deemed as attractive frequently had a higher overall teaching rating. However, the hotness category was eventually removed due to its objectification of instructors. 
Despite these shortcomings, the  concept of Rate My Professors has potential for growth. With the change in ownership, it is the ideal time to make the needed changes on the website. Some of these problems have simple solutions, such as requiring that students make an account with an university email before leaving a review to prevent multiple reviews for the same instructor or the creation of a system that checks that a student actually had a particular professor before they can leave reviews. 
Other changes will require heavy discussion, such as bridging the clear differences in opinions, reflected in the wide range of reviews, by redefining what each numerical score means. And perhaps most difficult, some improvements are more systematic and require drastic measures, such as the issue of separating professors as people from their jobs within the classroom. 
Regardless of changes that are made, Rate My Professors will continue to be utilized. However, it does not mean there isn’t substantial room for improvement. There are fundamental changes that will better assist both parties involved: the professors and their potential students. When utilized properly, the professor rating tool can give the educators more insight to refine their teaching and help students find the perfect instructor for a course.

I’ve seen a troubling amount of celebration among progressives following last week’s midterm elections and the Democrats’ control of the House of Representatives. 
The midterms were not a victory for Democrats; rather, they were a sleeping dart shot into a raging beast that should not have happened in the first place.
My pessimistic view was not a product of the Democrats’ Senate loss (and the losses of rising political stars like Stacey Abrams and Beto O’Rourke). Simply put, there is no such thing as victory while President Donald Trump remains in office. There is no victory until his unreasonable, immoral impact on American politics has been erased and disavowed by a new moral consensus. 
Don’t get me wrong — the midterms weren’t a defeat for the Democrats, but the absence of defeat is not a true victory. A blue House will certainly put a much-needed check on a brazenly nationalist White House: New House committee chairs will be appointed, which means Democrats will be able to act on and potentially subpoena Trump’s tax returns. But even if the president’s tax returns are revealed, and even if they demonstrate some form of illegal activity, I have extremely little faith that the GOP-dominated Senate would follow through, even if the House moved to impeach the president. If the Senate didn’t wish to hold then-Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh accountable for his actions as an accused sexual assaulter, why would they act differently toward Trump, the jewel of the GOP? It would take something extraordinary for this election to indicate impeachment, and even if it does, Vice President Mike Pence wouldn’t be an improvement. 
The Democrats have gained the power to slow the Trump administration’s attacks on human rights — the environment or immigration — but not the power to stop them. I’ll assume that little to no progress will be made to strengthen the Affordable Care Act, increase gun control regulations or improve any other sector of progressive politics. If the president needs the House to fulfill his agenda, the House certainly needs the president to fulfill theirs, too. The Nov. 6 election served mainly as a tourniquet but by no means a cure, and progressives must focus on  achieving true victory in the 2020 elections.
Among hotly contested races, Democrats won in places that Trump dominated in 2016 such as Wisconsin, Michigan, Kansas, Pennsylvania and Arizona. If  the Democratic party can hold all the states it won in 2016, and retain states they picked up in the midterms, the Democrats could cruise to an electoral victory in the 2020 presidential race, even if Arizona and Kansas turn red in 2020. While that may seem optimistic for progressives, the party must remember that Trump has a history of over-performing in states political pundits predicted would stay blue. 
And if the midterms served as a referendum on any electoral trends, they showed that a Democratic victory in those key states is possible, but not guaranteed. 
Even if Democrats do win in 2020, I still have doubts for progressive morale. Based on the predictions from one study-project that included the collaboration of multiple Washington, D.C. think tanks, voter turnout is expected to be at what could be an all-time high during the next election. According to a 2005 study by researchers at UC Davis and the University of Florida, conservatives tend to do worse when more people do vote, so, it’s reasonable to believe that will likely spell trouble for Trump. 
Though there was a rage-induced increase in voter turnout, rage isn’t a sustainable model of civic engagement beyond 2020. Democrats shouldn’t be focused on just the next election, but the countless future races. Brief political satisfaction tends to foster apathy among constituents, which can lead to future low turnout and a loss of morale and identity within the party. 
It’s going to take more than one term and one Congress of viable leadership to undo the damage Trump has done to the United States both legally and symbolically. Trump has already appointed 84 judges, including two justices in the Supreme Court, to lifetime positions of high power. He has rolled back regulations on healthcare and the environment and stoked a generation’s worth of racial resentment. It’s going to take decades of mass political engagement, particularly among young people who must work on Democratic campaigns and vote for progressive values in every single election possible. 
The fight is not nearly over yet. Join a campaign, knock on doors, make phone calls and never stop voting. Do not become complacent after one election  — especially one that wasn’t a complete catastrophe.

Trees by Trojans, an environmentally-focused student group, hopes to mitigate the city’s environmental impact by installing green infrastructure and planting more trees. 
TxT hosted its first tree planting event on Adams Boulevard and Magnolia Avenue on Nov. 4, and plans to continue planting trees across USC’s campus. Nine members of TxT cleaned, dug and aerated the planting ground to prepare. The pre-selected planting location was previously occupied by a tree that had died, according to TxT President Drew Quinn.  
“[Trees are] a legacy in a way, because these trees will last long after any of the members are here. I do think that one main part of the mission is equity,” said Quinn, a graduate student studying planning and a registered tree tender. 
Quinn said Los Angeles homeowners are entitled to receive up to seven trees from the local government, given adequate capacity. 
“The city [gives] away lots of trees … but that is a benefit that goes largely to wealthier neighborhoods, and part of it is because lower income neighborhoods are not aware and it is not really advertised to them for them to take advantage of,” he said.
The group planted a fern pine tree, a drought tolerant type of tree. At the end of the 45-minute long tree planting event, the group named the tree Fernando. 
Vice President Lauren Deaderick, a graduate student studying public policy and planning, said the first tree planting event was a both an educational and social experience that exposed her to the various functions that trees have in urbanized landscapes. 
“What was kind of nice was that there had been an old tree there, and some of the old roots we were able to turn into natural mulch,” Deaderick said. “So, we were able to plant [the tree] on top, which is good to prevent fungus in the future.”
Trees also have a lasting positive effect on the environment throughout their life cycles, according to Deaderick. In addition to the practical needs of beautifying living spaces and proving fresh oxygen, decomposing trees can help new trees grow on the same soil. 
“A lot of trees have been cut down due to development of our city,” Deaderick said. “So [we’re] replanting trees, bringing back that growth and the beauty within the community, and also just the practical need of shade that a tree brings, particularly in our very asphalt community in USC and South L.A.”
Patrick Lewis, TxT  outreach and marketing coordinator of TxT, said that planting trees allows students to create tangible environmental change. 
“[Trees] provide shade, they help absorb [carbon dioxide] and [admitting] oxygen so it is good for us to breath, reducing heat island effect,” said Lewis, a graduate student studying planning. 
There is a lack of transparency and information regarding the ownership of trees between residences, according to Lewis. TxT wants to facilitate the planting and maintenance process for local residences to increase the number of trees in urban residential spaces, he said. 
TxT hopes to recruit members to help spread its mission of environmental justice in the USC community. 
“We want people to help us to devise a plan to reach out to the community,” Quinn said. “If you are interested in trees, if you are interested in urbanism, we are a group that will accept  you. We want everyone’s opinion to go into the pool and help affect [our mission].”

This year, the Department of Public Safety Cadet Program partnered with DPS and the Los Angeles Police Department to pack Christmas gifts for Operation Christmas Child. From the fundraiser, which was held from Oct. 29 to Nov. 12, DPS collected 60 shoeboxes filled with hygiene items, toys and school supplies for children all around the world. 
Operation Christmas Child is a program where shoeboxes filled with gifts for girls and boys ages two to fourteen will be distributed. All the shoeboxes will be sent to North Carolina for distribution.
Since the program’s inception in 1984, DPS cadets spend multiple years learning about crime prevention and community engagement with guidance from DPS officers.  In addition to getting exposure to law enforcement, cadets also receive academic support through USC’s Joint Educational Project and tutors. 
Stephanie Guerra, a cadet adviser and community relations officer, said the program is designed to instill personal life skills to local youth. Through engagement projects like through Operation Christmas Child, Guerra said cadets learn to give back to other communities through service.  
“We start with the kids because no matter what community is always going to be there,” Guerra said. “[A cadet] live in a small neighborhood, you are surrounded by a community so they would want them to understand and know that simple little things impacts.”
The DPS Cadet Program is one of 31 LAPD cadet posts that have collected shoe boxes for international shipment. Last year, the cadet programs completed 1,700 boxes and collectively raised $1,400 to cover shipment costs.  
Cadet Bryan Cuanenemi, a junior at the 32nd Street USC Performing Arts Magnet school, has been a DPS cadet for three years. He said this program has gave him more discipline and confidence. 
“It makes me happy that we are able to change like help people in need. At least I give them something that they may not have,” Cuanenemi said. “I really like it honestly it makes me happy knowing that I am able to help someone in need.” 

Although this is DPS’ main service event, cadets have also hosted canned food drives for Vincent St. Paul and a toy drive for the celebration of Latin-American Holiday traditions in Dec. for La Posada with USC’s El Centro Chicano. 
Officer Roy White, who is also one of the cadets’ senior leads, highly regards the mission for the cadet program because he is an alumnus of the program. He said he was motivated after graduating from the program as he saw other cadets mature and gain their sense of identity. 
“Some of the same skills and characteristics or traits that we learn through our training and are built in our training like being punctual, being on time, being self-disciplined, effective communication, community engagement,” White said. 
Keyla Estrada, a senior at Manual Arts Senior High School, said White has influenced her and the other cadets. With the mentorship of DPS’ officers, Estrada said she found guidance and support through the program, particularly during the college application process. 
“I never thought I would have the greatest support knowing that it would be Officer White,” Estrada said. “It’s good they are pushing us and we don’t feel like there is no one who cares for us.”
As the cadet program continues to support Los Angeles youth, Officer Guerra said the current christmas fundraiser encourages the students to reflect on their parents’ contributions. 
“There giving these items to those children who need them or never experienced a gift for them to know just like how they appreciate their parents for giving them their things,” Guerra said.

Online harassment is prevalent among journalists, according to Natalie Green, PEN America’s manager of Los Angeles programs. 
Green and other members of PEN America spoke to students and journalists at Wallis Annenberg Hall Monday about various strategies and resources to prevent such harassment. The event was the first of three sessions on campus meant to promote open conversation about online abuse. 
PEN America, a nonprofit organization that aims to defend and celebrate the rights of literature and the press, began the discussion with an emotional video displaying harassment female sports journalists receive on the internet. 
Green said online harassment can range from hateful speech and online threats to trolling and doxing. 
The organization conducted a study about harassment in November 2017 surveying over 200 journalists targeted by online commenters. Two-thirds reported a severe reaction to harassment, including refraining from publishing work, deleting social media accounts and fearing safety. 
“We thought that we would be going into newsrooms trying to convince people that this was a problem; [instead] we would go into newsrooms and everybody raises their hands,” said Viktorya Vilk, manager of special projects and free expression for PEN America. 
The survey also investigated harassment regarding ethnicity, gender and sexuality. 
“It probably won’t surprise you that women, people of color and LGBTQ individuals are much more likely to experience more severe forms of harassment,” Vilk said. 
Using survey data, PEN America created an online harassment field guide which includes a manual with tactics and resources for writers, journalists and their employers. 
“We acknowledge that the online harassment field manual, as wonderful as it is, is really a stepping stone,” Green said. 
The organization emphasizes preparation for harassment to minimize repercussion. This includes heightened cybersecurity, such as covering laptop cameras and turning off geolocation. 
The conversation also centered on documenting harassment through screenshots and learning to report or block harassers on social media.
“People will tell you there is a right way and a wrong way,” Vilk said. “There isn’t actually. There is no right way or wrong way. There is what works for you.”
The conclusion of the discussion focused on the relationship between online harassment and mental health. 
“I thought the [presentation] was really informative on how to respond and steps you need to take if [harassment] ever occurs to you,” said Nicholas Echevarria, a sophomore majoring in sociology.

The USC chapter of Young Democratic Socialists of America partnered with the Student Coalition Against Labor Exploitation and the National Union of Healthcare Workers to deliver a letter to USC Interim President Wanda Austin on Oct. 25. Since the delivery, a tentative three-year contract has been negotiated between the workers and the administration. 
Meg Aldrich, the director of media relations at Keck Hospital of USC, said the contract will be voted on by NUHW members later this week.
The contract will apply to the 1,100 workers at Keck. Union worker Matt Artz said the average raise over three years will be of 14.5 percent. 
With the settlement, contract workers previously employed under Sodexo, a food services and facilities management company,  will now be under USC’s management. Workers will receive employer-paid health insurance, a retirement plan with a 5 percent employer contribution and significant raises. Workers’ wages can rise more than 50 percent for the lowest paid Sodexo workers, according to Artz.
“We demonstrated to the employer that the community, including the students at the university and YDSA, were united in support of the Sodexo workers,” said NUHW President Sal Rossell. “We had to work so hard and threaten the strike to accomplish just bringing these workers up to comparable wages and benefits to everyone else that works for the University.”
Moving forward, the University hopes to continue to amend relations between its employees and the administration, said Rodney Hanners, chief operating officer for Keck Medicine of USC.
“I can’t say enough about our team at Keck that worked tirelessly at the bargaining table alongside NUHW’s team to meet the needs of our workforce. We want to ensure our employees know how much we value their contributions to the success of Keck Medicine of USC,” Hanners said.  “To that end, I think our employees will be very pleased with the focus of our contract. We look forward to announcing those details in the very near future.”
USC union workers and organizers got together prior to the delivery of the letter to discuss workers’ struggles and how to address the issues affecting 76 cooks, nutrition assistants and food service workers who prepare all the food for the USC Keck Hospital’s patients, physicians, staff and visitors.
The letter describes the workers’ grievances and lists the demands that the NUHW wants for its workers, which include in-sourcing jobs to provide a higher living wage and added health care benefits, according to Michael Hsu, a steering committee member of YDSA and SCALE. 
“In return for our work, however, many of us earn poverty wages — just pennies above the minimum wage,” the letter read. “Eighty-one percent of us earn less than $15 per hour. We have no affordable health insurance. Many of our families go without health care, which costs as much as $460 a month in premiums. Our wages are so low that many of us qualify for public assistance programs like Food Stamps, Medi-Cal and public housing.”
Hsu, a sophomore majoring in non-government organizations and social change, said members of both student organizations went to Bovard Auditorium to deliver the letter to Austin. Once the students reached Bovard, they were surrounded by DPS officers and were not let into the building, he said. 
USC Chief of Staff Dennis Cornell came out to speak to the organizations about how the administration is seeking to improve negotiations.

During suspension, the Phi Sigma Kappa (above) and Sigma Alpha Mu fraternities were not allowed to host social events. (Dimple Sarnaaik | Daily Trojan)
USC removed the Phi Sigma Kappa and Sigma Alpha Mu fraternities from interim suspension Thursday. 
The USC Fraternity and Sorority Leadership Development site no longer lists the two fraternities — which were accused of hazing — as facing disciplinary consequences. 
Fraternities under interim suspension were prevented from hosting social events, such as a Sigma Alpha Mu fundraiser event that was meant to finance medical expenses for the fraternity’s sous chef. 
“We are happy to be reinstated but we are still at a loss to understand [the] ‘suspend first’ policy,” Phi Sigma Kappa president Bradley Billig said in a statement to the Daily Trojan. “We have the same interest as the University to create a safe environment for our members, but their process rather than promoting cooperation, fostered an adversarial situation.”
Matthew Parker, the vice president of Sigma Alpha Mu, declined to comment. 
Prior to the suspension removal, Phi Sigma Kappa filed a lawsuit against USC on Oct. 18, claiming USC violated its own policies and the California Code of Civil Procedure, which requires a fair hearing and factual basis for punishment. 
The fraternity will continue to pursue the lawsuit, according to Billig. 
“We want to ensure all students accused have a fair adjudication process,” he said. 
The fraternity stated in the lawsuit that the University had not informed the fraternity of hazing allegations and had subsequently tarnished its reputation. 
The Interfraternity Council declined to comment. The University’s media relations department did not respond in time for publication.

Sophomore Maya Tribbitt’s hometown Thousand Oaks, Calif., is facing crisis after crisis. 
On Thursday night, one day after a mass shooting at the Borderline Bar & Grill, Tribbitt heard about how the Woolsey fire was encroaching on her community. She called fellow USC student and Thousand Oaks resident Deeksha Marla to help cope with the back-to-back disasters.
“We went to the same high school, and her house was in the direct line of fire when it started,” Tribbitt said. “It was really hard for us to grapple with [the events] and explain how we were doing to other students who aren’t from California or from our area.”
The USC community has felt the effects of California’s raging wildfires since Thursday. California is the most represented state among the University’s undergraduate student population, according to USC Admission’s freshman student profiles. And some USC students hail from Thousand Oaks, a community about 40 miles north of South Los Angeles that is being threatened by the Woolsey fire. The Los Angeles Times reports that about 370 homes and businesses have been destroyed in the blaze, and around 57,000 structures are still at risk.
Northern California is also battling the Camp fire, the deadliest in state history.
“It’s really weird being away from home when something like this is happening because I haven’t talked in person with a single person from Thousand Oaks in the last week,” said Quinn Jones, a freshman majoring in arts, technology and the business of innovation. “I just felt like I really wanted to go home, so I could [be] surrounded by people that understand my problems.”
Through social media, students like Jones whose families affected by the fire have been able to stay connected, but some say they feel alienated by their peers as they try to comprehend the past week’s events. 
Associate Vice Provost for Campus Support and Intervention Lynette Merriman sent an email to students with addresses in zip codes affected by the fires to offer emotional support services and crisis counselors on Friday. 
“We are concerned about the effect the recent wildfires in California have had on members of the USC community,” the email read. “This can be a traumatic time for students, and we wanted to let you know that we are concerned about your well-being and the safety of your families.”
Tribbitt, who is majoring in international relations and journalism, said her family was forced to evacuate on Nov. 8 and that the condition of their home remains undetermined. 
“My family just recently was allowed to go back,” Tribbitt said. “They went back [Sunday] and the air quality was so bad that they went back to their hotel … but we don’t think there’s any actual fire damage [to our home]. But my friends’ houses have burned down completely.”
Tribbitt’s father is a professor at Pepperdine University in Malibu, where classes have been canceled through Thanksgiving break because of the Woolsey Fire. 
Adam Omary, a freshman majoring in biophysics, said the fire reached a park near his Thousand Oaks home.
As a Southern California native, Omary and his family have experienced fires and evacuations before. His family was updating him as they moved in with friends in Santa Barbara these last few days.
“I knew they would be safe,” Omary said. “It’s nice knowing that I don’t have to be there to experience all of it because it’s pretty stressful, but it’s also weird sitting back and just watching and having to wonder what’s happening or where they are.” 
Interim President Wanda Austin sent an email to the USC community on Monday, encouraging affected students to reach out to USC Support and Advocacy, the Center for Work and Family Life, Trojans Care for Trojans or other counseling services.
“The terribly destructive fires that have ravaged California this past week have directly and profoundly affected the USC community,” Austin wrote. “Some members of our community live in areas that have been evacuated, or have sustained tremendous damage, while many more have been feeling significant stress and worry about family members, loved ones, and friends who reside in these areas, and who now may be facing difficult recoveries.”
