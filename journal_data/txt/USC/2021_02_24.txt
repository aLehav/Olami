The men’s volleyball team fell in three straight sets against the Pepperdine Waves at Galen Center Wednesday night. USC now stands at 1-3 on the seasonand in the MPSF conference. The Trojans have lost their last three matches, winning only two sets in those three losses.
USC came close to pushing the match to four sets, taking an 18-15 lead in the third, but ultimately service errors prevented the Trojans from finishing. After holding off five Pepperdine match points, USC had an opportunity to win the set leading 28-27. However, the Waves were able to climb back and secured the win 30-28. It was the first time  the Trojans were swept this season.
In the first two sets, it was neck-and-neck as the Trojans tried to play catch-up after falling behind a couple points early. Pepperdine took the first set 25-23 and would go on to dominate in the second set 25-17. 
USC struggled to hit the ball cleanly throughout the night. In the second set the Trojans’ struggles became really apparent as only 9 of their 17 points were from kills. The Trojans were outpaced by the Waves from the front row, finishing with a .277 hitting percentage while Pepperdine went for .348. 
Head coach Jeff Nygaard said he believed it wasn’t how the Trojans finished their attacks but rather the defensive struggle that put the ball in a tough position for hitters to follow through. 
“First contact we got to make sure we put it in a place where we have four attackers, guys have one-on-ones,” Nygaard said, “As our first contact improves, so does our hitting percentage.”
Despite USC’s tough outing, redshirt junior outside hitter Billy Fautleroy finished with 22 kills, hitting 41.7% from the field to lead the team. Faulteroy came within one hit of tying his career-high single match kills of 23. 
Coach Nygaard spoke highly of Fautleroy’s effort in the Trojans’ loss. 
“He stayed very calm, he was very fluid and he hit the ball high deep and hard,” Nygaard said “I think he’s capable of doing that every single night.”
Serving errors killed any chance for the Trojans to go on substantial runs. When it came down to cutting two to three-point leads, a ball in the net would result in another point for the Waves and ultimately tallied up to the two-point match deficit.
The Trojans started the season with a promising win over UCLA, defeating the Bruins at Pauley Pavilion for the first time since 2014. Nygaard said the biggest difference between the opener against UCLA and the Trojans’ last three losses has been the costly error points.
“The difference between those wins and these losses is one or two points that we earn,” said Nygaard. “Tonight, we had three aces and 15 [service] errors. We want to make sure that we are in a much better situation of not that many errors but the last time out we had over 20 service errors. Our serving is getting better.”
USC will face Pepperdine again on Friday in a potential revenge match in Malibu. Despite losing three in a row, Nygaard said it’s too early to worry about changing anything drastic. 
“I’m just going to stay patient,” Nygaard said. “We are going to break through pretty quickly with the work ethic and the competitiveness and the systems that we have. I think we are going to be playing some real good volleyball.”
USC will travel to Malibu to take on Pepperdine at 5:00 on Friday at Firestone Fieldhouse.

What sparked years of roles in plays, commercials and now films for USC senior and actress Ji-young Yoo originally started just as a way to get an easy A. 
“In middle school, I was required to take an art … A girl in my dance studio said she took acting class because the acting teacher is super easy,” Yoo said. “And then I took the class and ended up loving it.”
As Yoo expected, the class wasn’t intensive, but she still remembers performing a three-page long scene called “The Funeral.” 
“It was this scene where two women who don’t get along at all at a funeral, just arguing and horribly rude to each other,” Yoo said. “I just remember yelling a lot.” 
But the feeling she got from performing that scene was unlike any she had ever felt before, even from performing dance.
“It wasn’t the nitty-gritty acting stuff, it was mostly just playing around, some improv,” Yoo said. “[But] I had never stood on a stage like that before. I performed a lot as a dancer, but it’s very different as an actor.” Contrary to what one might expect — acting is known as a risky profession — Yoo’s parents were relieved when she announced her plans to pursue a career in acting. 
“I wanted to be a professional dancer before I wanted to be an actor,” Yoo said. “[But] as a professional dancer, there is a certain expiration date for what your body can do. At least you can still continue to act when you’re older.”   
Yoo’s mother was particularly encouraging of her daughter’s aspirations. 
“My mom has always been really artistic and wasn’t really allowed to pursue that side of her in a professional setting,” Yoo said. “So I think when I started to express a lot of interest in the arts, she wanted to give me the opportunities that she wasn’t afforded.” 
Yoo then went from her middle school acting class to performing in theatre and landing her first professional show in eighth grade. The performance was for Theatre EspiritAsia, the first Asian American  theater company in Denver. 
In high school, she performed in a total of fourteen shows, such as the musical “The 25th Annual Putnam County Spelling Bee” and “Almost, Maine.”  
“I was actually thinking about this the other day, I don’t know how I did that many shows,” Yoo said. “It’s like, a little ridiculous I did so many. I did some musicals, I did some straight plays and I did some improv shows. I did Shakespeare.” While Yoo cherished the ability to experiment with acting through such a wide variety of performances, she didn’t expect to act professionally during college. Instead of applying to the School of Dramatic Arts, she applied to USC as an Asian American studies major and later switched to cinema and media studies in her freshman year. 
“I figured, especially because L.A. is so much bigger, I had no idea how to get an agent. I had no idea how to step into the professional world so I was like,‘I’ll just do student films and maybe some of the theatre shows at SDA … just get to know the lay of the land,’” Yoo said. 
Yoo worked on several student films as both an actress and a crew member. “That really [helped] me understand what everyone else is doing on set. No one really expects the cast to know anything about [film crew] jobs,” Yoo said. “When the grips are setting up a sort of lighting rig, I know what they’re doing and why they’re doing it.” 
On a whim, Yoo auditioned for the play “Man of God,” not expecting to get a role. To her surprise, she was given the role of Samantha, a high school girl who is distraught once she and her friends discover that their pastor has hidden a camera in their hotel bathroom. Described as a “funny feminist thriller,” the play was produced by East West Players, the nation’s first professional Asian American theatre organization.
“They’re the longest-running theater of color in the country and the largest producer of artistic work,” Yoo said. “And I guarantee you, nearly every single Asian American actor known today has passed through East West Players at some point in their career. So I worship at the feet of East West Players.” 
Yoo was excited to portray Samantha because she was unlike any role that she had done before.
“She’s very, very convinced in the righteousness of the world and is very shocked to learn that the world isn’t as righteous as she thought it was,” Yoo said. “I loved … that show so much.”  
Natasha Tina Liu, a friend of Yoo’s and a fellow actress, had first seen Yoo in “Man of God” and later met her again during an audition. “Before she went into the audition room, I was like, ‘Hey, you did a really good job in “Man of God.” And then we started talking and she wanted to grab coffee afterwards.’” Liu recently performed in the film “Synchronic” starring Anthony Mackie and Jamie Dornan. 
Through her performance in “Man of God,” Yoo captured the attention of the entertainment agency CESD and launched her professional career. 
Now Yoo is set to play Sarah in the upcoming film adaptation of the popular YA novel “The Sky is Everywhere,” her first major film role. Directed by Josephine Decker and written by Jandy Nelson (who also wrote the novel), the film centers around a high school girl, Lennie, struggling to cope with the death of her older sister.
“The Sky is Everywhere” is produced by A24, of which Yoo is a big fan. 
“[It feels] very surreal. Earlier in 2020, I had bought a pair of A24 shorts because I’m a really big fan of A24. I was like, ‘I’m going to buy these shorts and someday, years down the line, I’m going to be in an A24 movie,’” Yoo said. “Then I actually ended up working on an A24 movie later in the year.” 
Yoo originally auditioned for the main role but was called back for a director’s session for the role of Sarah, Lennie’s best friend. Although she didn’t get the role she originally set out for, it was almost a sort of relief for Yoo. 
“I actually remember reading the script and really liking it but going, ‘Oh man, I don’t think I can cry as much as they want me to cry [for Lennie]’ … ‘I don’t know if I can pull all of that out of me,’” Yoo said. 
After her director’s session in June 2020, Yoo was asked in September if she was willing to shoot in Northern California for eight weeks. “I was like, ‘Yes, let’s do that. I’ll drop out of school right now,’ Yoo said. “And that’s basically what I did.” 
Yoo deferred her final semester and set off to shoot in Humboldt County. On set, she was able to work with high profile actors like Jason Segel and Cherry Jones, who play Big and Gram Walker.
“[Jones] is amazing,” Yoo said, laughing. “I just, I want her to actually be my grandmother.”
What drew Yoo to the role of Sarah was her unabashed confidence. “I would say Sarah is the most confident, joyful version of me,” Yoo said. “Part of what people are going to notice about Sarah immediately is her clothes, her makeup and hair … She really changes it every day and she’s never one type of style for long … She just couldn’t care less about what anyone else thinks and that was really fun for me.” 
In what is otherwise a grief-filled, dramatic story, Yoo’s character brings a sense of levity and lightness. “I did so much comedy on ‘The Sky is Everywhere,’ Yoo said. “… I [had] to have so much energy to be Sarah on set, everyday.” 
Yoo was also drawn to how the film approaches Sarah’s Korean American identity and forged a connection with the production designer Grace Yun, who is Korean American. 
“I think what I’m really excited about is how much [Sarah is] Korean American and how much it … isn’t the center of who she is,” Yoo said. “I think her Korean American-ness feeds throughout her whole life, partially because I look the way I look but also because the production designer is also Korean American.” 
She pointed towards how Yun designed Sarah’s bedroom as an indicator of the film’s authenticity in portraying Sarah’s character.  
“I think it was very touching because you can see the Korean culture but nothing about it is exploitative,” Yoo said. “Lately, with a lot of Korean roles that I’ve been seeing, a lot of people are kind of jumping on writing Korean roles because of the Hallyu Wave and K-pop. And I think that’s a really cheap way to talk about being Korean or about any ethnicity.”
As an actress of color, and specifically as an Asian American actress, Yoo had no pretense of the difficulties she would face.
“I walked into this industry knowing how hard it was going to be. There was never a question in my mind that this was going to be easy at all,” Yoo said. “Like I knew it was going to be hard, just as an actor, and then even harder as an actor of color.” 
Aware of the struggles of being an Asian American actress herself, her Asian Pacific American Student Services mentor, Jacky Jung, stressed the need for a supportive acting community when mentoring Yoo, whom she grew to be friends with throughout the course of their careers. 
“I really emphasized the importance of being good with your craft, but also finding different instructors and different folks you look up to and can trust in the artistic process,”Jung said. “[I was also] candid about how it was like to navigate not only just USC’s acting program but any acting program as an Asian person.” 
Although securing roles is an arduous process as an up-and-coming actress, Yoo was adamant on avoiding stereotypical or marginalized roles. 
“At this stage of my career, it’s not necessarily me being really picky or choosy about what I audition for,” Yoo said. “It’s mostly what I will absolutely not audition for. And I think for Asian American actors and for actors of color and marginalized actors, the things we won’t audition is stuff that hurts us in terms of representations and stereotypes.” 
Yoo pointed to her cinema and media studies major as one of the reasons she was able to better understand her Asian American identity within the context of the film industry. 
“Because I was able to do a lot of studying of Asian American history in general, I feel like I have a really good understanding of how film operates as an object once it’s gone out into the world,” Yoo said. “[Everything] I do in cinema and media studies is based on the sociopolitical contexts of film, TV and other types of media. So when it comes to acting, I’m able to look at my career in a larger context.”   
Yoo said that, at times, she felt demoralized by the slow pace of progress in the Hollywood industry, but has learned to overcome those feelings. 
 “An article came out recently that Daniel Dae Kim, after 30 years in the business, has finally landed a lead role in a TV show,” Yoo said. “I’ve come into this industry with the understanding that it’s going to take a while. And it’s a marathon, not a sprint.”

Girl Online, the pseudonym for January Billington, a junior majoring in creative writing, doesn’t make music with a team of men backing them. They prefer their bedroom to the male-dominated classrooms of Thornton. And besides a small team consisting of their manager, a friend who masters their music and photographers or designers they collaborate with, they’ve entered the music industry alone.
Their friend and sophomore year roommate, Joyce Ni, describes Girl Online’s creative process as one that is completely solitary and filled with self-imposed intensity. 
“Rooming with [them], I always saw that [they were] always hammering away at [their] laptop, making beats and producing sounds,” Ni said. “You can really tell that it’s [their] passion.”
For Girl Online, this stubborn independence is intentional. The 20-year-old artist revels in their solitary creative process. In an industry where production is largely dominated by men, Girl Online aims to make a space for femmes.
Their journey to music was a lonely one as well. Aside from a few piano lessons, they felt no push from family members to pursue their craft. Instead, afternoons in front of the Disney Channel inspired a young Girl Online to plunge into writing. 
“The Disney pop girls…Selena Gomez, Hannah Montana, Demi Lovato. They were a huge influence on me,” Girl Online said. “They were my initial [sign that] I want to be a [singer-songwriter].
Girl Online’s roots in poetry and writing shine in their music and vice versa. They describe writing professors often urging them to turn a poem into a song, and still today, poetry is an avenue of expression for the artist.
At age 15, the Fresno native graduated to production. Recognizing the dearth of femmes in production, and inspired by artists like Grimes, SOPHIE and FKA Twigs, they concluded that maintaining their identity in the music industry requires having full control over the music they create. This commitment pushed Girl Online to start creating their own beats.
“It’s really important for me to be producing the music myself. At least, it’s important for me to [decide] 90% of what happens on it,” Girl Online said.
Their early writing and production manifested in their first EP, “Lonely Lover.” The project was entirely produced in GarageBand in their childhood bedroom. Since it dropped on SoundCloud, it’s garnered hundreds of thousands of streams. Despite the attention, Girl Online characterizes the EP as a meme now.
“I’m actually astounded that many people were vibing with what I had to say when I was 16,” Girl Online said. “My most streamed song ever is a cover that I hastily recorded after school, in my bedroom.”
While Girl Online’s older music was created for fun, and often hastily, their newer music is more purposeful. They sat on their latest single, “no man is ever gonna change u,” for seven months before releasing it in February. 
“It’s okay to be confused / Just don’t believe you get to choose,” Girl Online cries over the song’s upbeat synths, chimes, spacey delays and natural trance-like sounds.
“I think [their] older music was just like ‘January is playing her music again.’ We would just laugh and dance and sing along,” Ni said. “[Their] new music? I actually was like, wow, the lyrics are really, really deep. I really felt [it] pulling on my heartstrings.”
The artist’s musical expansion is reflective of their personal growth. Towards the end of summer 2020, Girl Online found themself grappling with the biggest sexuality crisis of their life. They anxiously evaluated every experience they had with a man, trying to understand if what they previously thought was attraction was just conditioning. In desperation, they returned to their creative outlet. The result is a melodic ballad that provides a reassuring critique of compulsory heterosexuality. 
“You don’t get to choose what your sexuality is. There’s not going to be a man that decides to change you. It just is what it is,” Girl Online said. “No matter if you are bi or a lesbian — that part of your identity — it’s something autonomous.”
Addressing LGBTQ+ causes and theory is what draws Girl Online to hyperpop. The genre is known for its maximalist approach to pop through the incorporation of unconventional sounds.
After moving to Los Angeles, Girl Online’s nightlife soon consisted of numerous HEAV3N parties. These rave-like functions were dominated by hyperpop and led by members of the LGBTQ+ community — a comforting experience for the artist. However, listening to the late SOPHIE’s “Ponyboy” solidified their interest in the genre. 
“I think the one thing that draws so many gay people to hyperpop [is that] it’s just so freeing and fun. It’s that pure escapism,” Girl Online, who identifies as lesbian, said.
The electronic elements of hyperpop are often accompanied by references to internet culture and communities. In collaboration with other artists and designers, Girl Online creates cover art reminiscent of the internet of the earlier 2000s — the same one they grew up on and haven’t strayed far from.
The artist has amassed a following on Twitter, largely due to the support of other sapphic femmes. A quick swipe through their account reveals a witty, socially engaging Twitter persona. Solana Pallo Ross, a long-time supporter, is drawn to Girl Online because of the digital sapphic space they create in a world that doesn’t validate their love. The same queer-related themes and critiques of compulsory heterosexuality that manifest in Girl Online’s music appear in their tweets. 
Many supporters, like Ross, who produces her own artistic work, also feel creatively affirmed by Girl Online’s celebration of sapphic love in their music and art. Girl Online’s supporters often learn about their music after stumbling across their page and recognizing them as a fellow creative and potential friend. This inspiring presence becomes even more important as creatives experience isolation and stagnation during the coronavirus pandemic.
Girl Online’s popularity on Twitter can largely be attributed to their humorous but gentle engagement with their followers. On a platform where users can resort to biting remarks during squabbles, the artist chooses to promote solidarity instead. They effortlessly encourage discourse relevant to marginalized communities, engaging supporters with empathy and a playful attitude.
“They’re always cracking jokes or making astute comedic observations, and oftentimes they go viral. But they’re also really kind,” Ross said. “Girl Online encourages a kinder and less vitriolic experience online.”
In many ways, Girl Online’s current experience on the internet, like many things, circles back to their childhood, and they don’t shy away from this fact. After experiencing a breakup in early 2020, the artist went through stages searching for their personal style. One period, which they endearingly describe as “human highlighter,” has largely faded away, aside from their bright purple hair. The result of this journey, however, is an amalgamation of Y2K, kawaii and cyberpunk elements. Their current fashion and beauty is largely reminiscent of the aesthetics that defined the popular culture arena of their childhood.
“Gen Z is like, we all grew up on the internet,” Girl Online said. “We all have these ancient Windows 95 memories of internet code in the back of our brains.”
Their unabashed exploration of their most childlike self is what lends authenticity to Girl Online’s voice. The creative identity they’ve built is backed by an ability to bare raw emotion and honesty, whether it be in their music, poetry or personal style. Their sonically upbeat production may not match their brooding lyrics, but the combination feels very right. Pulling from their deepest core values, identity and experiences, Girl Online creates a pixelated reality where cathartic release doesn’t entail wailing, whimpers or shed tears. Who needs men when you’ve got that?

On June 17, I awoke in a cold sweat. It’s seriously not a good idea for you to check your phone when you first wake up, as it increases stress and anxiety, but when I turned off my alarm, there was one notification I simply couldn’t ignore. 
That crisp morning at 8:44 a.m. came the Deadline announcement that Kristen Stewart was tapped to play Princess Diana in “Spencer,” the newest biopic about the late and great cultural icon. I think about it almost every single day, to the point where I ask anyone at any given moment whether I’m allowed to gatekeep who plays Diana. I’m kidding?
In the same press release, Pablo Larraín, director of “Jackie” among others, was set to direct and produce. The Chilean filmmaker has his chops, and talked with Deadline about what is behind the inspiration for this project.
“Diana is such a powerful icon, where millions and millions of people, not just women, but many people around the world felt empathy toward her in her life,” Larraín said. “We decided to get into a story about identity, and around how a woman decides somehow, not to be the queen. It’s about finding herself, about understanding that possibly the most important thing for her is to be well, and to be with herself and by herself.”
The “People’s Princess,” a very unusual title for someone within the British royal family, was given to Diana for a number of reasons. Her work destigmatized diagnoses of HIV and AIDS without the backing of the crown, and she was known as an incredible mother in the now classic photos of her with her sons Prince William and Prince Harry at Thorpe Park. She turned the media attention from her split with Prince Charles onto her anti-landmine campaign and drew the million people who lined the route from Kensington Palace to Westminster Cathedral to catch one last glimpse of their princess before she was laid to rest, with millions more watching abroad.
You can’t overstate the profundity of her influence. I see countless photos of her style, demonstrated through her lavish David and Elizabeth Emanuel wedding dress, her fabulously non-royal-appropriate “revenge dress” and especially the classic sweatshirt, biker shorts and sneakers combo all the time in fashion anthologies or on social media. For many kids around the world, reading about her and watching her life go by was a moment to reflect on how we wanted to shape our lives on good deeds such as hers. 
OK, back to being sweaty. I’m not going to get into a Kristen Stewart debate because (1) this is not the column to piss people off in and (2) it doesn’t matter to my point. 
A few months after the “Spencer” announcement was made, “The Crown” offered the very best portrayal of Diana they could muster in Emma Corrin. And boy did she deliver. Looks are one thing, but when you have almost the spitting image of a young Diana Spencer staring down the Queen and pair it with Corrin’s seemingly natural spryness, naïveté, swiftness and sense of wonder about the world — you’re bound to face a difficult time in separating the actor from the role. 
Whatever you think of Stewart stepping so quickly into those shoes, both she and Corrin are participating in a losing battle. Take the proverbial caution: “Never meet your heroes.” I’d argue you never want to meet them on the screen either. 
The biopic is possibly the most limiting film genre ever coalesced. Rarely are they made of particularly controversial figures, and when it comes to groups underrepresented on screen, their use shifts to that of a patronizing, “well at least you got a film” mentality from studio execs. 
Similar to “Jackie,” Larraín’s new project is to span just a weekend, one of Diana’s last Christmases at Sandringham when she contemplates her future with Charles and the royal family. I’m going to pull my “the only time I can use my philosophy major” card here. In what L.A. Paul calls a transformative experience, when you approach a decision that is fundamentally about who you are and who you will be after the choice you make, you can’t possibly prepare rationally to answer because you have no idea who you will be on the other side. 
In a movie that spans three days time in real life, of a person who faced a situation that no one else in the world has ever faced and of a legacy that is globally sacrosanct, you’re not going to get what you’re looking for because it simply is impossible. This is regardless of who’s directing it, who’s acting (though I have my concerns) or any of the other billion pieces that come together to create a movie. It’s incomplete.
The closest you can get to a picture that’s closer to the whole of Diana is through the artifacts, oral histories, newsreels and interviews that were collected during her life. But even that isn’t her; it isn’t the people’s princess. Should Larraín or others be responsible for portraying the entirety of a person’s being on screen? Maybe you think no, but is the subject still the same within the screen’s limitations?
There are incredible biopics whose credit goes predominantly to their actors, just add “La Vie en Rose,” “Ray,” “Capote” or “The Passion of Joan of Arc” to your little Letterboxd list. But they cannot and will never capture the breadth of these people’s lives. And while one person is chosen to be “worthy enough” for a biopic to be made, thousands of other stories are left behind. Appreciate these figures while they are alive and honor them in their passing. Let’s leave the biopic behind instead.

A research team from the USC Viterbi School of Engineering has created a four-legged, semi-autonomous robot to help fight the spread of coronavirus. The robot has been named Legged Agile Smart Efficient Robot for Disinfection (LASER-D) and is able to move on a variety of terrain to sanitize surfaces with a chemical spray-based disinfectant. The machine was created as a research opportunity for master’s students, combining two previous systems: a disinfection robot and a quadruped robot. 
LASER-D can currently be controlled from a short distance away, with its vision system being overseen by an operator. The vision system serves as a way for operators to control movement while the robot is in development. The team is currently using a machine learning system to help the robot identify disinfected surfaces and said the robot’s visual perception is better than that of a human. LASER-D moves with “waypoints,” which are areas and points that are mapped and designated by the operators to guide the robot through an area.
Anthony Nguyen, a graduate student studying mechanical engineering who worked on the LASER-D project, said the pandemic was a big shock to everyone but that he was glad to have been part of a team that worked to provide solutions to the world’s new problem.
“As engineers, I think we really feel the need to tackle the current issues that are going on in the world and come up with innovative solutions,” Nguyen said. “I think the USC engineering department did a great job of that. And there’s so many opportunities here at USC and to be able to work on the first quadrant robot for disinfection was a pleasure and an honor for me.” 
The team, made up of seven graduate students, is headed by Dr. Satyandra K. Gupta and Dr. Quan Nguyen, both professors at Viterbi. Initially, Gupta’s lab was in the process of developing a UV disinfection robot, while Quan Nguyen’s lab had focused on quadruped robots. The new team includes Zhiwei Deng of the Ming Hsieh Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, as well as Abhinav Pandey, Anthony Nguyen, Pornrawee Thonapalin, Ruiqi Wang, Tailun Liu and Yiyu Chen of the Department of Aerospace and Mechanical Engineering.
At the start of the pandemic, Gupta and Quan Nguyen’s labs had the idea to combine their projects to create a new, more mobile robot capable of non-hazardous disinfection. The team modified the disinfection system and attached it to a robot better equipped to move through classrooms to aid in disease prevention.
“They decided to combine the disinfection system from the wheeled robot onto a quadruped robot instead… [LASER-D] can traverse through classrooms, stairs and slippery slopes,” Anthony Nguyen said. 
The new team, specifically formed for this project, was composed of four sub-teams, each designated to work on a different part of the project: motion planning, simulation, vision and experimental. 
The robot’s movement is controlled from a short distance away and can disinfect mechanically. The benefits of making a four-legged robot rather than a wheeled one with a new disinfection system is that, by adding legs, the robot can access a kind of three-dimensional space by moving its different joints. Anthony Nguyen described this as the difference between a UV light scanning a two-dimensional surface versus a three-dimensional spray system that can move around an object. 
The vision team was in charge of implementing LASER-D’s vision system, which helped remote operators control the robot’s movement and disinfection tasks. 
Nguyen said the role of the simulation team was to create artificial environments, or world environments, to define the waypoints for the robot. The team is able to plan out the motion of the robot so when it’s time to send it in for disinfection, LASER-D knows how to move. If the robot is able to disinfect most areas, but certain areas are too tight or too close, the simulation team is able to define the area’s waypoints beforehand.
Pornrawee Thonapalin, a graduate student studying aerospace and mechanical engineering, said she worked on the motion planning team, creating the waypoints to guide the robot’s movement after mapping out the location. During research, Thonapalin was able to begin the mapping process, which is followed by the data being sent to the simulation team to program LASER-D’s movement. 
In tandem with the experimental team, the group in charge of building and physically experimenting with the robot, the sub-teams worked to combine each of the different systems for the LASER-D project to be successful. “I have some experience [going] to the lab. Sometimes we have to go to the lab, one day for one person, or as many as two people to working on it, and it’s very difficult to work remotely because we have to experiment,” Thonapalin said.
Nguyen said that the biggest challenge in working on the project was not being able to meet in person to work on the robot and having to navigate creating something physical in a virtual space. His role on the simulation team did not require him to experiment with the robot in person. A lot of the project involved screen sharing on Zoom and working through different time zones. 
“I would say the pandemic was ultimately the biggest challenge for us, but at the same time if it wasn’t for the pandemic we wouldn’t have this project,” Nguyen said. “So I’m thankful that I got to work on something that’s benefitting the world or just helping us figure out a solution to something that’s affecting us as a population.”
The robot is still being trialed, and while it has been tested on campus as a method of disinfection, it is not yet meant to be used on a larger-scale. In addition, the robot isn’t fully autonomous yet; Dr. Gupta said the robot is “teleoperated” and must be reasonably close to its operator to be controlled. It’s also limited to its single battery charge and cannot travel very far. 
Despite these limitations, the robot is still semi-autonomous, meaning LASER-D only has to be set to work and supervised by the operator remotely. The team is hopeful about the future autonomy of the robot. Nguyen described some possibilities in which the robot could be used to reduce pollution and pick up trash autonomously in a time when LASER-D’s successors could be used for projects outside of disinfection research.
“Robotics in general and AI, it’s such a fast-growing industry, and with this project, you can go in so many different directions,” Nguyen said. “I definitely see this project being used in the real world … it was a lot of trial and error, and at the same time I think that a lot of the people on our team were really motivated to do their jobs and get things done, so I guess that’s why we were so successful in making it work.”

“Promising Young Woman” is a masterpiece. While it may be unsettling to some, it is an all too real and recognizable world to me. Straight men are the scum of the earth, and writer and director Emerald Fennell does not shy away from this narrative. 
Fennell, best known for her portrayal of Camilla in “The Crown” and for her time as showrunner on “Killing Eve” season two, directs her bombshell script. 
Cassie, our leading lady, played by Carey Mulligan, is a grief-stricken medical school dropout with a taste for revenge. 
“Every week I go to a club, and every week I act  like I’m too drunk to stand,” Cassie said. “Every week, a nice guy comes over to see if I’m OK.”
When they finally get to an intimate setting, she drops her act, shocking the men. The premise unveils in the trailer; however, beware of spoilers below. 
Cassie is the ultimate femme fatale. She may dress as a cotton-candy-cherry-on-top-girly-pop, but she is more than meets the eye. Fennell told The Hollywood Reporter that Cassie’s style was a coping mechanism; to blend in, she expresses hyperfunction.
The film is a masterclass of writing utilizing show versus tell. The lack of expositional storytelling makes for a more compelling watch. 
While in college, Cassie’s best friend Nina was raped. Her rapist, Al Monroe, went unpunished, and the trauma resulted in Nina taking her life. 
After dropping out of medical school, Cassie begins working at a coffee shop where she meets Ryan, a charming pediatrician portrayed by Bo Burnham. He recognizes Cassie from college and asks her out. 
On their first date, he tells Cassie he is still in touch with a few people from their time in school. When she returns from the date, she looks up the names he mentioned and plans her revenge for Nina. 
First, she calls up Madison, a former classmate, who disbelieved Nina’s assault. Cassie is disappointed but not surprised to see Madison still dismisses Nina’s attack. 
Additionally, she targets the defense attorney who defended Al in court. When she finds him, the situation plays out differently than expected. Heapologizes, sobbing into Cassie’s lap and she forgives him. 
Choosing to abandon her plan, Cassie falls in love with Ryan and can disentangle herself from her trauma to love again. Even though on-screen their relationship is sunshine, singing along to Paris Hilton and gumdrops, I knew it was a facade in the pit of my stomach. 
Alas, Madison shows up at her house to tell Cassie she remembered a video of Nina’s rape exists on her old phone. She begs her not to watch it, but Cassie doesn’t listen. Mulligan’s nuanced performance in this moment of reliving trauma, anger and pain is Oscar-worthy.
The video reveals Ryan’s presence at Nina’s attack. Cassie shows Ryan the video and promises to release the video if he doesn’t give her the address to Al’s bachelor party. 
When Cassie calls Ryan out, he transforms from a sweet guy to a blubbering, whiny toddler. Fennell reminds us that, subtly, men may seem kind, but toxic masculinity always prevails on the surface level.
Cassie arrives at the party dressed as a “sexy nurse” and forces all the men to drink. As they all cheer her on, she tells Al she doesn’t get paid unless they go upstairs alone.
Though the movie deals with heavy-handed content, there is never explicitly graphic imagery. During the bachelor party, one notable moment of directing is when Cassie cascades vodka into the men’s mouths. Close-ups on lips, teeth and messy mustaches flashed on the screen. I saw men as grotesque dogs, guzzling vodka — the camerawork permitted animalistic depictions, a nod to Fennell’s eye for directing. 
Once they are alone, Al asks for her name, and Cassie says, “Nina Fisher.” Al freezes. 
“It’s every guy’s worst fear getting accused like that,” Al said, whining. 
“Can you guess what every woman’s worst fear is?” Cassie said in return. 
She tells him she will leave him with a permanent reminder of Nina and grabs a knife, but Al manages to slip a hand free. In a brutal scene, Al suffocates Cassie using all of his force until she falls limp. Cassie remains splayed, arms in a T, with a pillow covering her face. 
The imagery alludes to Cassie as a Christ figure, and in some ways, she is. She sacrifices herself for Nina. 
At Al’s wedding, Ryan receives a scheduled message from Cassie. The roman numeral five displays on the screen and police sirens ring. My heart began racing. 
“You didn’t think this was the end?” Cassie said.  
The film ends successfully, maintaining its tone. “Promising Young Woman” is a gripping,  delicious watch. From start to finish, Fennell’s writing remains impeccable. The plot is tight, and every act is thrilling. The ending is satisfying. 
Casting also played a role in Fennell’s vision. The casting of lovable, recognizable men comedians, such as Burnham or Sam Richardson, as Cassie’s predators allowed the movie to pierce harder. 
Every choice is intentional. Every detail is essential; Fennell’s stylistic choices create an artistic masterpiece of womanhood. 
Even the music played a large role in my captivation. It is hard not to have a pessimistic view of straight men after the film, but Fennell’s brutal script is reality. Rape cases go unbelieved, are swept under the rug and those accused go on to be doctors, lawyers and “upstanding” members of society. 
The tragedy of the film stems from realism. My wish for “Promising Young Woman” is just to make men think twice. Being a bystander is complacency.

Alexis Areias and Lucy Warren were elected as the next president and vice president of the Undergraduate Student Government, Anna Rodriguez, chair of the USG elections commission, announced at the Senate meeting Tuesday. The results will be finalized by the director of campus activities next week. 
Areias, a junior majoring in political science, who served as a senator this past year, and Warren, a junior majoring in economics, who served as chief diversity officer of USG, captured 53.90% of the voter turnout, amassing 1,920 votes in total in the preliminary results, becoming the second ever female-female ticket in USC history to win the presidency and vice presidency. Over 3,500 votes were cast in this year’s presidential election over the three day voting period last week, marking a near 25% decrease in voter turnout compared to last year.
Areias and Warren defeated two other tickets. Other tickets included Shreya Chaudhary & Antonio Okeke, and Alexandra Gill & Del Wood. Chaudhary and Okeke received 928 votes, 26.30% of the voter turnout. Gill and Wood received 552 votes, 15.64% of the voter turnout. One hundred and forty seven voters abstained from voting in the presidential election.
As highlighted in their campaign, Areias’ and Warren’s agenda will focus on “Breaking Barriers” and “Prioritizing Inclusion”, bringing in the work of other “student advocates” to shape their platform. Their slogan, “Committed to showing up, determined to get it right,” represents the broader change they hope to bring to USG.
“We want to incorporate everyone’s voices into what is our action plan,” Warren said. “Through [meeting with USG members and cultural leaders] and taking our platform, we can really figure out the best possible way to move forward. But it starts by just building those relationships.”
All campaigns were run nearly entirely online –– except for the campaign photos that feature parts of campus –– pushing all candidates’ strategy into a digital-first platform. For Areias and Warren, their online presence consisted of Instagram infographics, a Spotify podcast, promotional videos and YouTube parodies, including their version of the Wired Autocomplete interview.
With one less ticket on the ballot than last year, their fight for the presidency may have been slightly easier but that didn’t undermine the struggles of garnering student support, especially with remote learning. The biggest stage for candidates to present their platform and answer the most pressing questions –– the debate, which was last held in the Wallis Annenberg Hall lobby –– was held over Zoom and livestreamed on Facebook. 
Candidates met with individuals and groups for endorsements over Zoom as well. Areias and Warren received endorsements from Trojan Democrats, The Trojan Left, USC Challah for Hunger, Trojan Advocates for Political Progress and other student groups.
For Areias and Warren, this win comes at a crucial time. This is the first USG election since the resignations of former President Truman Fritz and former Vice President Rose Ritch over the summer after allegations of racial misconduct were highlighted by the Instagram account @black_at_usc. The incoming administration will also play a crucial role in the safe re-opening of campus, as USC opened several previously closed facilities this week and President Folt announced plans for a “full return to campus for the Fall semester.”
“What was so central to this campaign, and why we kind of framed it the way we did, is that Lucy and I were there through all of [the Truman/Fritz controversy],” Areias said. “We’ve seen the really high points in this organization, but we’ve also seen the low and I think that’s been huge in our perspective.”
Areias and Warren will be inaugurated later this spring along with the newly-elected group of Senators.
The 2021-2022 USG Senate will consist of Hana Li, Arie Abija, Nivea Krishnan, Ruben Romeo, Hunter Hinson, Matthew Ayala, Kevin Gutierrez, Tommy Nguyen, Russell Agustin, Diego Andrades, Devin Ayala and Brian Stowe.

It’s finally time to talk about DMCA.
Yes, yes, I’ve beaten around that bush for quite some time now. But after seeing the official Twitch gaming channel put royalty-free music over a Metallica show in real-time, I knew the time had come to address the topic properly.
For those of you who don’t know, DMCA (an acronym for “Digital Millennium Copyright Act”) is a copyright law in the United States. While it’s certainly very complex, what’s important to know is that the law prevents the dissemination of copyrighted material on the internet without consent of the owner. 
What’s so bad about that? Nothing really. Copyright laws are in place to protect individuals and their products from theft. And generally, they succeed. But things get a little trickier when it comes to Twitch. 
Video games and esports are fast-paced, so livestreaming is content delivered at the speed of light. Not only is livestreaming instant but it often requires very little infrastructure and preparation. This has led to thousands of streaming channels being created, meaning there seems to always be someone you like streaming something you love — and also likely using copyrighted material.
This isn’t to say that streamers are thieves. But let’s explore a hypothetical situation; Say you’re a Twitch streamer. Odds are you probably stream some sort of video game. And let’s say that, while you’re riding around the fictional world, a copyrighted song starts playing through the in-game radio. Or imagine that you’re talking to your chat while you wait for the game to load and decide to put some music in the background while you wait. Are these things theft? Technically, all you’re doing is listening to music. But at the same time, you are earning money based on someone else’s copyrighted content. 
Are you starting to understand why I called copyright laws on Twitch “tricky”?
In reality, it’s hard for someone to receive a DMCA strike — a notice of copyright infringement which can lead to the streamer being banned from the platform — during a livestream. Like I mentioned before, there are thousands of channels simultaneously streaming, so the chances of someone finding your stream the moment in which you use copyrighted material are incredibly low. The majority of them are found through archived livestreams or “clips” of the streams that get shared around. It’s also worth noting that, up until last May, streamers on average received less than 50 DMCA-related messages per year. So what happened?
According to Twitch, record labels began taking a more active role in hunting down those clips and sending strikes to channels. Under the DMCA law, Twitch as a platform is protected from any legal responsibility as long as they remove or block the copyrighted content on the platform. So, to avoid being sued directly, Twitch moved swiftly in notifying creators of the infringements. 
Actually, swiftly might be a little too nice of a word for what happened. 
Twitch sent out emails to hundreds of streamers telling them either to delete the copyrighted content or, depending on the number of strikes they had, risk having their channels terminated. In some cases, Twitch scrubbed the content off themselves, notifying the creator only after the process was done. 
After some time, Twitch recognized its mistakes in a blog post and promised to implement better tools to help streamers deal with the problem, such as creating a database of copyright-free music and allowing streamers to file counter-notifications. But everything that Twitch has currently offered is, at most, simply a means to escape possible retaliation from record labels. 
In other cases, the proposed changes have no actual weight and are simply just for show. Take, for example, the ability to file a counterclaim. Sure, creators need to be able to stand up for themselves. But without Twitch’s help, only the streamers who have the financial means to go to court against a big record label will go through with it. The platform needs to actually take a stand with its creators and try to make the current situation better and not just bearable. 
While Twitch must follow DMCA guidelines, it still has enough leverage to try and make a deal with the labels themselves. Twitch is a massive platform that brings in millions of viewers, larger than any of its competitors. It would be in the interest of the labels to strike a deal and have their music showcased on the site.
This entire situation started because of copyright law, something that already puts it leagues above the internal politics of esports tournaments. But that shows just how essential it is for Twitch to do something about it. If Twitch doesn’t stand up for its creators, it’s likely that the current situation will not change, as labels will continue to use DMCA with no regard to the streamers they are impacting. 
More and more, creators will feel as if the platform has become impossible to survive in, giving ample room for Twitch’s competition to step up and steal them away. So finding a way to diminish the effects of DMCA and empower streamers is, quite literally, what might determine Twitch’s survival as a platform.

An NBA season unlike any other has now officially completed two months of play. Like the season, which has been at times exhilarating and at times pretty disappointing, ex-Trojans are having up-and-down seasons around the Association. From first-year players to prominent veterans, here’s a look at some of the best ex-Trojans in the league. All stats are accurate as of Monday, Feb. 22.
Nikola Vucevic, Orlando Magic
The 6-foot-11 forward is playing the best basketball of his 11-year career, averaging 24.1 points per game and 11.7 rebounds per game on 48.1% shooting from the field. Vucevic has been a consistent 20-point scorer thus far, notching in at least 20 points in 21 of the Magic’s 31 games. 
His exceptional play has been one of the only positive takeaways from the Magic’s 13-18 record. Vucevic has been a beast on the block slicing and dicing defenses for easy buckets. In the last month, this has led to some impressive performances. 
Against the Chicago Bulls, Vucevic dropped a ridiculous 43 points and 19 rebounds on nearly 60% shooting. Four games later, he did it again — scoring 42 points on 77% shooting against the Sacramento Kings. 
Two games later, the big man did something he’s only done two other times: have a triple-double. He put down 30 points, 16 rebounds and 10 assists against the Golden State Warriors. 
It’s safe to say that Vucevic is primed for his second All-Star appearance later this season. 
DeMar DeRozan, San Antonio Spurs
DeMar DeRozan is having yet another great season, averaging 19.8 points per game. He is also averaging a career-high 6.9 assists per game along with 5 rebounds a game.
In the wild Western Conference, DeRozan is doing his best to keep the Spurs relevant. They are currently sixth in the conference and playing better than many expected, holding a record of 16-11. 
However, there have been some up-and-down moments for DeRozan. He’s found himself scoring in single figures more times than he’s found himself scoring over 30-points. The Compton guard’s notched four games with 30-plus points and a season-high of 38 against the Minnesota Timberwolves, but still, the occasional scoring dips are a bit worrisome.
Even with some off games, DeRozan is still going strong after 11 seasons, a testament to his work ethic and dedication.
Onyeka Okongwu, Atlanta Hawks
The second-highest all-time draft pick from USC has had a rough start to his NBA career. Okongwu missed the first several weeks of the season due to a fractured toe and made his debut in mid-January. 
Since then, he has struggled to find some consistency averaging only 10 minutes a game. He has also never reached double-figures in points and has had two scoreless games. 
The minute disparity and lack of production come as no surprise with the Atlanta Hawks having multiple veteran forwards on the roster. It can also be attributed to the lack of a training camp for Okongwu due to his toe injury. 
However, it is still early on in the season and Okongwu will have some more opportunities to show off his potential.
Kevin Porter Jr., Houston Rockets
After having a solid rookie season, Porter Jr. has experienced a considerable fall from grace during his second year. 
The 6-foot-4 guard was arrested for gun charges in November 2020 but had the charges dropped in December. A month later, Porter Jr. found himself in even more controversy after finding out his locker was given away to a newly acquired player, resulting in an altercation. 
Porter Jr. has played no games for the Cavs this season, and Cleveland decided to cut ties with Porter Jr. in January, trading the promising guard to the Houston Rockets after the locker room outburst. 
With the Rockets, Porter Jr. was sent down to the Rockets developmental team in the NBA G-League. He’s shined so far, averaging 22.8 points per game, 6.9 assists per game and 1.5 steals per game. 
Despite his missteps this season, Porter Jr. still oozes with potential. Assuming he returns to his rookie season form, he’ll have his shot to prove himself again on the 11-17 Rockets. 
Jordan McLaughlin, Minnesota Timberwolves
Unlike established stars like Vucevic and DeRozan, McLaughlin is still trying to make a name for himself in the league. The former Trojan guard is having a decent year for the Minnesota Timberwolves averaging 5.7 points and 4.8 assists per game.
After playing only 30 games last year, McLaughlin has played in more than half of the 30 total this season. He’s been a key player in the Timberwolves rotation, bringing some nice energy off the bench and scoring in double-figures in five games.
Assuming McLaughlin’s trajectory continues, he figures to establish himself as a solid role-player and rotational point guard in the NBA.

This Wednesday, USC’s men’s volleyball team will be trying to get its season back on track against Pepperdine at Galen Center. The game was initially going to take place on Feb. 4, but it was postponed after a positive coronavirus test within USC’s program. The Trojans will also take on the Waves in Malibu on Friday.
Due to the high number of coronavirus cases in Los Angeles County during the last several months, USC was unable to practice throughout much of the fall and was limited to just two weeks of workouts in early December 2020 and then a few more weeks of drills and practice in January.
Because of the strict safety precautions, the team has found it difficult to gain consistency and fluidity with timing for practices and games, and head coach Jeff Nygaard said having two consecutive games against Pepperdine this week gives the team the opportunity to establish an identity for the season. 
“The guys know and trust the system that we would like to run, and I know top to bottom, every single guy on the team knows exactly what we want to do and when we want to do it,” Nygaard said. “Going into this match against Pepperdine, we’ve got two of them in the same week so we get to test out some things that we want to do, and we get to test them against the team … They’re going to be a good, tough challenge for us.”
Redshirt junior outside and opposite hitter Billy Fauntleroy said that the team is approaching the pair of games against Pepperdine with optimism, and some improved strategy. The Trojans are currently 1-2 on the season, having won the first game of three opening games against UCLA before dropping the second two. 
“We’re coming off two losses against UCLA, two losses where we should have won,” Fauntleroy said. “It just means that we have to do a better job of closing sets. And I think that frustration we’ve had losing the past couple of games is going to serve us very well against Pepperdine.” 
The team is also working on improving serves and eliminating errors heading into the Pepperdine games. In just the last three games, Fauntleroy has hit 38 total kills. Nygaard was emphatic about his pride in the team’s resilience given how late they started practicing for the season.
“I love the fact that we are grinding it out and competing against teams that have been practicing for far longer than we have,” Nygaard said. “We still have opportunities to win and we’re going to get better, we’re gonna maximize those, we’re going to keep continuing to work hard and want to improve, and we’re going to start getting those victories.”
The Waves are heading into Wednesday and Friday’s matchup having already played double the number of games the Trojans have played, owning an overall record of 4-2. Two of those wins came against Stanford, whom the Waves just swept. 
Meanwhile, Pepperdine’s only two losses this season came against BYU, which currently sits atop the MPSF standings with a 5-1 record. If the Trojans hope to beat the Waves, they’ll have to overcome a lack of in-game experience thus far. 
First serve against Pepperdine is at 5 p.m. on Wednesday. The Trojans and Waves will face each other again at 6 p.m. on Friday.

Criticism has changed from an almost elitist field to something that everyone can partake in within a matter of seconds on Twitter or another social media site. This has taken a foothold in politics, especially in the age of Donald Trump. 
For four years, the American people were led by a Twitter president. Trump’s constant tweeting gave the masses the license to share their thoughts to the world on any event, issue or policy. The vast majority of the time, these thoughts are shared with little research or analysis behind them. In turn, this causes a growing digital pit of fake news and misinformation, which has led to conspiracy theories such as QAnon.
This process can start with someone on the internet calling President Joe Biden “soft” for wearing a mask. Then, people start viewing him as a prop for the “deep state.” Later, people on Facebook begin critiquing the United States’ electoral process as a rigged system, #stopthesteal starts trending on Twitter and eventually there is a riot protesting the backbone of democracy in the U.S. Capitol building. 
Thousands, even millions of pieces of online criticism snowballed into this catastrophe, and in a field where free speech is sacred, this poses the question of whether mass criticism or criticism at all is appropriate in politics. 
On the surface, it seems quite American that anyone can express their beliefs to the entire world on any subject in the digital age. Unfortunately, the power social media provides to users to quickly post and share comments without critical thought has caused massive amounts of misinformation. 
A supporter of Twitter discourse may say that it is beneficial to have a plethora of opinions and then use judgment and knowledge to sort through them. However, there are severely detrimental, real-world effects to this sort of unrefined, hasty discourse. Recent examples include the aforementioned insurrection in the U.S. Capitol, a plot to kidnap the governor of Michigan and widespread protests of mask wearing and the coronavirus vaccine.
Despite this, there is still an important role for responsible criticism in politics. In the free world, criticism from the press serves as a key check on the power of elected officials. The media can critique policy decisions as well as restrain politicians from free reign on power. Recently, Trump pressured his preferred media outlet, Fox News, to overturn their decision in the Arizona race in order to give him a wider potential path to victory. Fox News refused to back down and served as a check on the president’s power and a protector of American democracy. 
A prime example of a check on policy by the press is The Washington Post’s 2013 critique of the National Security Agency’s widespread surveillance of U.S. citizens, which was highly invasive and infringed upon civil liberties. In this case, the criticism from The Post led to sweeping changes within the agency and helped to strengthen U.S. democracy by limiting government power. 
Criticism, especially in the realm of politics, has both positives and negatives that must be weighed against each other. Mass criticism can lead to the spread and dissemination of fake news but targeted, expert criticism serves to keep power in check and improve our society and is a necessary element of democracy. In fact, criticism may be the crux of democracy, due to its ability to check power as described above. 
Politics is a field of discourse, which has an inherent need for and interdependence with criticism, and effective politics simply cannot live without it. However, the very thing that upholds a strong democracy can also threaten it — as seen with the ramifications of widespread, baseless social media criticism. There is ultimately a need to narrow and refine criticism in all fields to ensure it is constructive, informative and perceptive.
This will certainly be a difficult path to navigate due to concerns of inadvertently limiting free speech. Unfortunately, as conspiracy theories and false news continue to grow and spread, either the government or private companies will have to (as Twitter and Facebook have begun to) make significant efforts to limit or block these asinine forms of content. A potential way around needing such restrictions is to promote a more educated, more intelligent populace. Stronger civic education curriculum in schools or encouragement of using self-judgment and analytical skills from a young age may help sharpen society’s brand of criticism and steer it away from the mindless, hasty parasitical criticism that has grown root.

Along with “Live, Laugh, Love” decorations and inaccurate BuzzFeed quizzes, the millennial “#Girlboss” craze has finally been laid to rest. But who is this so-called GirlBoss? If you ask her, she’s a go-getter with a killer resume, hustler work ethic and a one-track mind of climbing the corporate ladder. But if you look at the facts, she is often just an affluent (usually) white woman who partakes in the same harmful power dynamics as her male counterparts. 
This trend of “self-made” businesswomen in positions of power found its catchy name by none other than Sophia Amoruso, author of the business memoir #Girlboss and founder of the fast-fashion company NastyGal. This new movement established that the pursuit for inequality, especially in the workplace, came from a lack of women in positions of power. 
The solution was more women-run businesses and women CEOs — women with “unapologetic ambition.” Like trickle-down economics (we all have seen how well that works), the act of allotting women power within companies would empower and grant equality to other women around them. Rather than going for the jugular and dismantling the system of oppression itself, Amoruso and others thought that women could simply make it better from within. 
However Amaruso’s GirlBoss moment (along with its own Netflix adaptation) abruptly collapsed when accusations of discrimination and abuse were brought forth; eventually, Amaruso even filed for bankruptcy. Amid this scandal and the social and political upheaval of the last few years, it has become clear that GirlBossing was merely a “female empowerment” branding scheme catered to wealthy white cis-gendered women so that they wouldn’t have to feel bad about wanting a role in corporate America. Instead of uplifting other women, most of these female CEOs were actually proven to be just as bad as their male counterparts, participating in the same amount of abuse, mistreatment and corruption. 
Changing the gender of an individual at the top of a company’s hierarchy does not alleviate its inherent inequality because white corporate corruption and abuse cannot be defeated with more of the same thing. Corporate power structures and late-stage capitalism innately thrive and profit off the backs of working-class people, particularly working-class people of color.
If an entire system and its history rest upon a foundation of white supremacy and exploitation, then a mere adjustment in leadership — especially to someone with almost the same privileged status as white men — will never be enough. 
The punchline within all of this discourse, however, is that the whole GirlBoss movement never set out to genuinely help women or dismantle the patriarchy. It was, instead, a sneaky and well-branded way to justify accruing wealth and capitalizing on the abuses within the corporate system. 
Referring back to the case of GirlBoss patient zero Amoruso, it is important to note that NastyGal is a fast-fashion company that uses sweatshop labor and looks the other way at unregulated, unsafe work conditions. Approximately 80% of garment workers in the clothing manufacturing industry — primarily in the Global South — are women. It seems that in the GirlBoss ethical guidelines, there is no mention of uplifting or protecting women whose labor women CEOs could use to line their own pockets. 
Under the guise of equality and empowerment, this type of elitist and superficial “feminism” has done the exact opposite of its surface-level intentions by further oppressing and abusing the most vulnerable groups of women in our society. A GirlBoss cannot become the first ethical billionaire because the middle part of the “Capitalism vs. Equality” Venn diagram is blank. It is integral to detach faith in capitalist structures to enact legitimate and transformative change and justice. For guidance in dismantling the system, we must instead look to the very people the harmful system has and continues to cripple.
