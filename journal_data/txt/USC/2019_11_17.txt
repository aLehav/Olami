USC passed its first road test of the season Saturday night with a 77-66 win over Nevada. With the victory, the Trojans improve to 4-0 while the Wolf Pack fall to 2-2 on the season. 
USC’s size and interior presence proved too much for Nevada. The Trojans outscored the Wolf Pack by 32 points in the paint. 
“I think we came out here and used our size advantage and played super aggressive,” senior forward Nick Rakocevic said after the game. “We played good defense and didn’t turn the ball over.”
USC head coach Andy Enfield shared Rakocevic’s assessment. 
“We thought our interior players were a little more experienced and a little better players overall,” Enfield said. “We thought we really needed to dominate the paint, and we did. Give our three bigs credit. They all played very good basketball.”
The Trojans started the night strong from their first possession. Just over 20 seconds into the game, sophomore point guard Elijah Weaver drove hard to the basket before collecting his dribble and dishing it to a trailing Rakocevic, who caught Weaver’s pass in the lane for an easy dunk. 
The play set the tone for the evening, and USC jumped ahead to an 8-point lead less than five minutes into the game. The Wolf Pack battled back, however, and took the lead six minutes later. A layup by Wolf Pack senior guard Lindsey Drew extended Nevada’s lead to three with 8:33 left in the first half. 
The Trojans followed up Drew’s layup with a 13-0 run during which all but three of their points came in the paint. The run put USC up 31-21 with 4:13 left before the end of the half, and the team never relinquished its lead. 
USC’s defense also shined during the contest. In the second half, the Trojans held Nevada to 23% shooting on 16 attempts from behind the arc. 
“That’s really good defense on our part,” Enfield said. “I’m really proud of our young men.”
Rakocevic paced the team in points with 24 on the night. Rakocevic also led the team with two steals, and his 11 rebounds were matched only by freshman forward Onyeka Okongwu. 
Redshirt senior guard Daniel Utomi pitched in with 12 points and four boards. Weaver scored 11 points while shooting 50% from the field. 
In addition to being USC’s first road opponent of the season, Nevada was also the Trojans’ toughest challenger yet. Last season, the Wolf Pack went undefeated at home before reaching the NCAA Tournament as a No. 7 seed. The roar of the 9,833 fans in attendance at Lawlor Events Center only added to the challenge the Trojans faced.
“I was telling [the freshmen] ‘Make sure you guys stay composed,’” Rakocevic said. “We just have to stay focused because it’s [the freshmen’s] first road game. I remember when I was a freshman. Overall, I think they played great.”
Okongwu, who scored 6 points in 27 minutes, said he relished the team’s first opportunity to play on the road.  
“It was our first road game, and we wanted to come out with a lot of energy, aggressive and be tough,” said Okongwu. “I love playing on the road because I love the atmosphere and the hostility.”
USC returns home to Galen Center to take on Pepperdine 6 p.m. Tuesday.

For the past few weeks, this column has focused on the coaching staff and administration of USC football. I made the obvious point that head coach Clay Helton will likely lose his job and provided evidence from the team’s play and the recent hiring of athletic director Mike Bohn to support my argument.
But after the team’s decisive 41-17 win at Cal Saturday night, I want to address the players because they have a really cool opportunity here. A lot of things have to happen for USC to return to college football’s elite in the coming years, but perhaps none is as key as this: the players who were on the field for that dominant effort — and who have been out there the last few games of this season — need to carry the lessons from this final stretch into the rest of their Trojan careers.
Say all you want about the competition, but the fact is that if USC beats UCLA in the Coliseum this upcoming weekend, the Trojans will finish the season 8-4 and will have won five of their final six games. That stands in stark contrast to last season, when the Trojans missed a bowl game with a 5-7 record in large part because the team lost five of its final six games. Yeah, USC has beaten some pretty terrible teams recently and an 8-4 season is nothing to be satisfied with, but it’s progress.
The Trojans have played better down the stretch this season; thus, there are lessons to take with them as they attempt to make use of their considerable talent. 
First and foremost, Kedon Slovis is the real deal. The freshman quarterback had his third 400-yard performance in four games and has thrown 15 touchdowns in the last four weeks.
Certainly, some credit should be given to offensive coordinator Graham Harrell’s scheme and massive injuries at running back forcing USC to throw the ball, but Slovis’ performance is nonetheless impressive. Cal’s secondary is strong, but Slovis had no issues carving it up despite being under constant pressure. Sophomore quarterback JT Daniels will have a chance to win his job back next season, but one takeaway is that this team can build a successful pass-heavy offense around Slovis.
Another takeaway is that USC can effectively make adjustments. The team’s inability to do so in the past can be attributed to poor coaching but also to the players’ collective mindset. Coaches can come up with all the changes they want, but they won’t matter if the players don’t execute them. In recent weeks, the Trojans have shown an increased ability to implement these adjustments.
Cal was a great example. The defense got bullied on Cal’s opening touchdown drive but cracked down on the run from that point on. This forced the Bears to win through the air, a strategy which only became better after redshirt sophomore starting quarterback Chase Garbers departed the game with a shoulder injury and was replaced by redshirt junior backup Devon Modster. The Bears were unable to make USC pay in the pass game.
USC’s offense found answers, too. The Trojans could have easily entered halftime tied at 10 but got lucky when Cal junior cornerback Elijah Hicks lost his footing on senior wide receiver Michael Pittman Jr.’s 33-yard touchdown catch. The Trojans had been able to move the ball a bit, but Cal’s previously incapable pass rush was able to get strong pressure that kept USC from lighting up the scoreboard.
In the second half, Harrell adjusted by calling for more deep balls. The offensive line adjusted to Cal’s exotic blitzes to give Slovis more time. And the freshman came through with some absolutely beautiful deep balls that gained massive chunks of yardage and bypassed the methodical drives that the offense wasn’t able to cash in through the first two quarters. The whole team needs to continue to prioritize this adaptability.
The final major lesson the players need to take from this stretch of games is the importance of mental fortitude. Lots of things have gone wrong for the Trojans the last few weeks — injuries have decimated entire position groups, and there have been more than a few questionable calls made against them.
But the team has done a good job of holding itself to a high standard while also maintaining a positive outlook. Redshirt junior receiver Tyler Vaughns was very limited Saturday, but freshman Drake London stepped up with six receptions for 111 yards and a touchdown. 
No one would have held it against the freshman if he stumbled in his first game in a crucial role or if he patted himself on the back for his performance, but London seemed completely unimpressed with his effort after the game. He expected for it to happen, and the rest of the team needs to take after his example of staying cool under pressure.
USC’s youth is the reason it has such a special chance to build off these lessons. It will be tough for the team to make up for departing cogs like Pittman and those who could enter the draft a bit early like Vaughns and senior left tackle Austin Jackson, but so many of the players who have been on the field for this improved performance will return next year.
USC has young players producing at virtually every position, and with the program’s worst recruiting class of the century incoming, it will be important for them to learn from the end of this season in order to thrive moving forward.

USC’s worst losses this season — and even a few of its closer wins — have featured essentially the same problem: things get bad, USC has trouble adjusting, things get worse and USC either leaves with a disheartening loss or an unconvincing win. 
In the Trojans’ 41-17 win over California Saturday in Berkeley, however, the Trojans looked like an entirely different team. USC had trouble at first and was tied at 10 at one point in the second quarter, but the Trojans eventually pulled away with a 17-0 third quarter to put the Bears away. 
“I think the biggest thing coming away from last week was, yeah we won, that’s great, but we scored 28 points in the first [quarter] and we scored 3 the rest of the game,” freshman quarterback Kedon Slovis said after the game. “That’s not to our standards. So I think this week, scoring continually throughout the game, really probably more so in the second half, that was more exciting for us.”
Slovis was the highlight of the Trojans’ 24-point victory, completing 29 of 35 passes for 406 yards, four touchdowns and no interceptions. It was the third time in the last four weeks that Slovis has thrown for at least 400 yards. 
“I think it just shows what our offense is capable of,” Slovis said. “Obviously, I think I can play better, even after a game like this … I think it’s just a testament to what this offense can be in the future.”
Slovis came out of the gate on fire, completing 17 of 21 passes for 190 yards and two touchdowns in the first half, but USC’s biggest plays came when Slovis caught a couple breaks. 
The Trojans’ first touchdown came when Slovis was forced to roll out of the pocket before finding a wide open Amon-Ra St. Brown for an 18-yard score after the sophomore receiver’s route dropped junior cornerback Elijah Hicks. Just before halftime, Slovis threw a deep ball to Pittman in one-on-one coverage with Hicks in the end zone. While the ball was in midair, Hicks lost his footing, and Pittman just had to reel it in for an easy 33-yard score. 
Both times Slovis was fortunate that his receivers came wide open, allowing for easy completions.
The Trojans entered halftime ahead by just 7 points, but dominated the second half. Cal struggled to get any offense going, punting three times and throwing two interceptions. 
Redshirt junior quarterback Devon Modster entered the game for Cal after redshirt sophomore Chase Garbers left with a left shoulder injury early in the second quarter. Garbers was playing in his first game since suffering a right arm injury against Arizona State Sept. 27. 
The Bears’ two quarterbacks combined for 15-of-32 passing with no touchdowns and two interceptions on the night.
“As a defense, nothing really changes for us,” redshirt sophomore safety Isaiah Pola-Mao said of adjusting to the different quarterbacks. “We still have the same mentality: get after the quarterback and get after their offense. When they changed quarterbacks, we knew we were just going to get after them.”
In a game where redshirt junior Tyler Vaughns was limited after sustaining an injury against Arizona State, USC proved yet again that its receiving unit is one of the deepest in the nation. Pittman led the charge with 180 yards, freshman Drake London finished with 111 and St. Brown added 85 of his own. 
London made it three straight games with a touchdown catch after going the first eight contests without finding the end zone.
“Drake’s a special guy. And to come in and not even go through spring ball and be able to do the things that he’s doing right now is really, really impressive,” offensive coordinator Graham Harrell said. “He’s just that talented of a guy, and he has a skill set that I’ve never seen before.”
The Trojans’ win improves their record to 7-4, and though its chance at a Pac-12 South title remains slim, the team has now won four of its last five games and carries plenty of momentum into next week’s regular season finale against UCLA.
“Just doing our part really, winning every game that we can,” junior offensive tackle Austin Jackson said. “We’ve got UCLA coming up, it’s a rivalry and Pac-12 South matchup, so it should be fun, and we’ve got a lot of work to get to.”
