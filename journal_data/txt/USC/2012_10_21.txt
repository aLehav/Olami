The USC women’s volleyball team continued its recent Pac-12 dominance, taking out both Utah and Colorado this week in straight-set sweeps to improve to 19-3 overall and 7-3 in conference play.
After a sweep against California in Berkeley following a tough loss at Stanford, the Women of Troy came back to the Galen Center and took care of the Utes (25-14, 25-14, 25-22) before defeating the Buffaloes (25-16, 25-19, 25-18) to complete a successful Parent’s Weekend.
“Our confidence level is exactly where it needs to be,” senior opposite Katie Fuller said. “After losing to Stanford, we came into practice and challenged ourselves. We focused on not only attacking what we think are our strong points, but also our opponents’ as well.”
The first set against the Buffaloes began as a tight one for the Women of Troy, who took an early 5-4 lead on a kill by junior middle blocker Alexis Olgard. A Colorado attacking error pushed the lead to 15-8, after which the Women of Troy put the set away. Back-to-back blocks by freshman middle blocker Alicia Ogoms and freshman outside hitter Samantha Bricio put the Women of Troy up 19-11, and Olgard finished off an exciting rally to make it 22-13. After an error brought up set point, the Buffaloes recorded three straight points before Bricio terminated the comeback attempt to seal the set, 25-16. Olgard and Bricio led all players with four kills apiece, while the defense held Colorado to a mere .032 attacking percentage with seven kills.
“They tried to run a much quicker offense [as] opposed to some of the other teams we’ve played, but our team runs pretty quick as well, so playing against ourselves helped us,” Fuller said.
Bricio continued her strong play into the second set, notching a kill and a block in succession to push the Women of Troy up 4-3. Two kills on the left side by junior outside hitter Sara Shaw pushed the lead to 11-7, after which the Women of Troy ran away with the set. Bricio came up big once again, slamming powerful kills from the left side to put USC up 20-10. The Women of Troy had trouble putting the Buffaloes away, as the visitors recorded six straight points. Nonetheless, Fuller brought up set point with a kill after which Ogoms ended the set at 25-19. The Women of Troy attacked at a .314 clip for the set and limited the Buffaloes to .107 with eight kills.
The Women of Troy took advantage of a few Colorado errors to begin the third set up 6-3, but Colorado hung around. Sophomore middle blocker Hannah Schraer, seeing her first action of the match, delivered a kill to go up 11-9, after which an Olgard kill forced a timeout at 15-13. The Women of Troy rattled off seven straight points to go up 21-13 on a Bricio kill. An Olgard kill and a service error brought up match point for the Women of Troy, who then sealed it 25-18 on a kill by sophomore setter Emily Young.
The victory followed a strong performance Friday night, again on the strength of another fantastic performance from Bricio. The freshman notched seven service aces along with six kills for a total of 13 points. The seven aces marked the most by a USC player since Asia Kaczor had eight in an October 2007 match against Oregon State. Shaw led all players with 10 kills and also added two service aces for 12 points. The Women of Troy put together a dominant hitting performance, attacking at clips of .571 and .480 in the first two sets before finishing at .341 overall.
“You’re seeing how tough it is in this conference to play on the road,” head coach Mick Haley said. “Colorado couldn’t muster the offense they’ve been able to bring against other teams. But we took both these of these teams out with our serving, and we have a combination of different serves that cause many problems.”
The victory also marked number 900 for USC’s all-time record — and number 303 for Haley, who is only eight wins away from USC’s all-time coaching record (currently held by Chuck Erbe, who recorded 310 wins in 12 seasons).
Meanwhile, as they continue their home stand this week, the Women of Troy will look to improve and solidify their rotations.
“We need to work on our system so that we can become more comfortable with it, and we need to keep improving,” Haley said. “I thought that by playing a lot of our players, everybody’s focus is high and everyone’s feeling like they’re getting better.”
The Women of Troy will host Washington on Friday before squaring off against Washington State on Saturday night at the Galen Center.

The USC women’s soccer team (5-8-3, 2-4-2 Pac-12) stayed home to play at McAlister Field for the first time in more than a month and ended a pair of streaks. The Women of Troy pulled out a 1-0 win over Utah (8-5-2, 3-4-0 Pac-12) on Friday, but fell to Colorado (7-7-3, 1-6-1 Pac-12) 1-0 in double overtime. The win ends a five-game losing streak on the road, all against Pac-12 competition.
USC played a close, hard-fought game against Colorado, with both teams taking three shots in the first half, as possession of the ball kept going back and forth. Both teams got more opportunities in the second half, as USC outshot the Buffaloes 9-7, with junior Elizabeth Eddy leading the team with four shots, including two on goal. But despite an aggressive second half, both teams combined for only one shot in both overtime periods. Colorado’s Amy Barczuk redirected a throw by Anne Stuller in the 105th minute to give the Buffaloes the win.
When asked about the game-winning goal, goalkeeper Caroline Stanley said, “The ball goes through 11 people to get to the back of the net, so it’s an entire team effort to score as well as to get scored on. We can’t point fingers, we just have to stay together through it.”
The Women of Troy outshot Colorado 12-11, although the Buffaloes had more shots on goal (6-5). Colorado also beat USC 15-13 in fouls and 9-2 in corner kicks.
Against Utah, junior Jordan Marada scored the lone goal on a cross by Eddy in the 34th minute, ending a 258-minute scoreless streak. The Women of Troy then used tough defense by junior Autumn Altamirano, redshirt sophomore Mia Bruno and freshmen Erin Owen and Marlee Carrillo to keep the Utah offense in check. Goalkeeper Caroline Stanley finished with five saves on the day, and the Utes didn’t get their first shot on goal until the 30th minute.
USC held possession of the ball for a majority of the first half, outshooting the Utes 7-3. Utah, however, became more aggressive in the second half, outshooting USC 9-2 and generating more offensive opportunities. But the Women of Troy were able to keep the Utes off the scoreboard and preserve the one-goal win.
When asked about the team’s performance this weekend, coach Ali Khosroshahin said, “I thought we played well on Friday. I thought today we were very inconsistent. The moments we were able to connect our passes, we were able to get in. We just weren’t real consistent about that today.”
USC remains home for the remainder of the regular season, taking on Stanford at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum on Friday, Oct. 26 at 7:00 p.m. PT and California at McAlister Field on Sunday, Oct. 28 at 1:00 p.m.

Women of Troy win pair of events
The Women of Troy split their team for two simultaneous events, but there was no impact on their success, as they beat San Diego 157.5-125.5 at USC on Friday and won the 2012 SMU Women’s Swimming and Diving Classic in Dallas on Saturday.
“Against USD, the women stepped up in the void of eight of our very best and came away with some outstanding early season performances,” USC coach Dave Salo said. “The women swimming at the SMU Classic are the core of our NCAA championship team and sent a message to the country that we will have a strong yet very young team competing this season.”
USC took five of nine events and led from start to finish in the 2012 SMU Women’s Swimming and Diving Classic. The event featured six teams with eight swimmers each, and only one swimmer was allowed for each ‘A’ and ‘B’ heat. USC finished the event with 366 points, followed by North Carolina (292.5), Florida (289), Texas (268), Louisville (236) and SMU (209.5).
The quartet of junior Kasey Carlson and freshmen Jasmine Tosky, Kendyl Stewart, and Kasia Wilk started the day off by winning the 200y medley relay in 1:39.83, beating second-place Texas by more than two seconds.
Tosky also won the 200y fly in 1:55.12, while senior Haley Anderson won the ‘B’ final in 2:00.62, and junior Meghan Hawthorne followed with a win in the 200y IM in 1:58.80, with junior Stina Gardell winning the ‘B’ final in 1:59.15.
Anderson, last year’s NCAA 500y free champion, finished second in the 500y free in 4:46.46 — UNC’s Stephanie Peacock won the event with a 4:38.39.
Gardell took second in the 200y breast (2:12.81), and Tosky won the ‘B’ final. Stewart won the 200y back in 1:54.11, which was one second better than USC’s best time in the event last year and three seconds faster than second place. Junior Meghan Hawthorne took the ‘B’ final in 1:57.86.
Carlson beat out her best time from last year in the 100y free by 0.05, winning the event in 49.05, and Wilk took the ‘B’ final in 50.51.
USC’s 200y free relay team finished a mere 0.25 out of first, with Carlson, Stewart, Stenkvist and Wilk taking third in 1:33.09.
Finally, freshman Sam Adams scored 252.10 points on the 3-meter springboard to finish fifth.
Against USD, sophomore Andrea Kropp led USC with three wins, and sophomore Lynette Lim added two more against the Toreros to help the Women of Troy improve to 2-0 on the year.
USC started the event with a win in the 200y medley relay, followed by a sweep in the 1,000y free. Freshman Nikki Chang took first for USC’s first individual win in the meet in 10:09.52, followed by junior Andrea Basaraba (10:13.32) and senior Chelsea Wild (10:30.47).
Lim, who earned All-American honors as a freshman, led another USC sweep in the 200y free, taking first in 1:49.97. Senior All-American Christel Simms took second in 1:52.91, and senior Kate Shumway finished in third in 1:53.00.
Senior All-American Yumi So then took the 100y back in 56.16, with sophomore Ashley Brewer finishing in second in 57.82, and San Diego’s Sarah Reirson took third in 59.79.
Kropp, who transferred to USC last year and was a 2012 Olympic Trials finalist in the 200y breast, won her first event of the day by finishing the 100y breast in 1:02.32. Senior Jordan Danny finished second in 1:05.34, while San Diego’s Sammi Cohn took third in 1:06.54.
USD won the next two races, with Keenan Lineback and Jacquie Kimmel taking the 200y fly (2:05.54) and 50y free (24.25), respectively. Wild finished second in the 200y fly in 2:08.53, and senior All-American Lindsay Parrish finished tied for second in the 50y free with USD’s Francesca Finucane (24.66).
Simms won her third event of the day, the 100y free, in 51.06, leading another USC sweep with Shumway in second (52.65) and Kimmel in third (52.68). Brewer would then take the 200y back in 2:02.90. So finished second in 2:05.79, while Rierson took third in 2:06.15.
Kropp earned her second and third wins of the meet in the 200y breast and 400y IM, with senior Jessica Schmitt finishing second in both events. Kropp beat out Schmitt 2:10.98 to 2:12.20 in the 200y breast and 4:13.44 to 4:14.09 in the 400y IM.
Lim won the 500y free, her second win of the day, in 4:55.30. Chang took second in 5:01.06, with Lineback taking third in 5:05.93. The event ended with San Diego winning the 400y free relay, beating out USC 3:31.26 to 3:33.27.
Trojans take season opener

The USC men’s swimming team also won its season opener at home against North Carolina State 173-119 on Saturday.
The Trojans were led by sophomore Cristian Quintero’s three freestyle wins. Quintero, an All-American as a freshman and a Venezuelan Olympian, swept the 100y (44.66), 200y (1:37.52) and 500y free (4:31.77), with the 500y free win leading a sweep. Sophomore Chad Bobrosky finished just behind Quintero in 4:31.88, while junior Nick Johnson took third in 4:33.64.
Freshman Ted Singley and sophomore Cary Wright spearheaded a 1-2-3-4 finish in the 1000y free, finishing in 9:18.98 and 9:20.53, respectively.
Senior Alex Lendrum, a 2012 All-American, won both the 100y back (48.57) and 200y back (1:45.44). Sophomore Luca Spinazzola took second in the 100y back in 49.54, while junior Chase Bloch finished second in the 200y back in 1:46.04.
Freshman Morten Klarskov followed with wins in the 100y breast (55.66) and 200y breast (1:59.01).
Senior Justin DiFederico, sophomore transfer Dakota Hodgson, and Wright completed a 1-2-3 sweep of the 200y fly, finishing with times of 1:47.90, 1:48.11 and 1:50.53, respectively. DiFederico then won the 400y IM in 3:58.41, with junior Sean Mulroy finishing in second in 4:00.47.
The 200y medley relay of Lendrum, Klarskov, Block and Quintero gave USC a win in the 200y medley relay in 1:28.98. The 200y free relay team of freshman Fred Abramyan, Bloch, freshman Zach Wagner and junior Jack Wagner took second in 1:21.78.
When asked about the performance of the men’s team, coach Salo said: “Motivated by the challenge to turn things around from the subpar performances on Friday, the men dominated nearly every event on Saturday morning.”

As senior quarterback Matt Barkley ran into the locker room after a 50-6 rout against Colorado, he was all smiles. And why wouldn’t he be? He had the game of his life and set records that should stand for years.
Historic mark · Senior quarterback Matt Barkley set the Pac-12 record for most career touchdown passes against Colorado on Saturday. – Carlo Acenas | Daily Trojan
Barkley threw his 100th career touchdown pass, making him the school’s all time leader, and the Pac-12 leader as well, surpassing former Trojan signal caller Matt Leinart. He went 19-20 on the day, giving him the highest completion percentage in conference history as well with a 95-percent clip. His efficiency rating was a staggering 319.16, the best in conference history by nearly 15 points. Oh, and he threw six touchdown passes, tying his own mark for the most in USC single-game history.
Yes, Saturday was about Barkley and his fellow star, junior wide receiver Robert Woods, who set the school record for receptions with his 217th. But in the grand scheme of things, it was all about Barkley. The four-year starter sits at 102 touchdown passes currently, and is one of only 15 quarterbacks in Football Bowl Subdivision  history to throw 100 or more touchdowns. Barkley is going to leave USC as the leader in pretty much every statistical quarterbacking category. His name will be all over the record books, and he’ll go down as the best signal caller in school history.
Beyond the numbers themselves, however, Saturday was about Barkley’s legacy and what he has meant to the USC program. I don’t know if a record such as the one he set yesterday for career touchdown passes will ever be equaled by another quarterback who graces the conference, but I do know this: No other player will throw a more meaningful 100 touchdowns than Barkley has.
Coming out of Mater Dei high school in Santa Ana, Calif., Barkley was destined to be a star. He was the top quarterback in his recruiting class and was on everyone’s All-American list. He came to USC, seized the quarterback job and got off to a fast start. His first career touchdown came in his first career game against San Jose State back in 2009, when the future was bright for the Trojans, who had just come off a Rose Bowl victory against Penn State in January. Pete Carroll was still at the helm, and USC was ranked in the top 10. He finished with 15 touchdown passes and was named a freshman All-American. The future was bright indeed.
Then, disaster struck. The NCAA sanctioned the Trojans, Carroll left to coach the Seattle Seahawks and players were free to leave the program without having to sit out a season. Ultimately, Barkley decided to stay and weather the two-season bowl ban. The Trojans trudged through a tough first season under new head coach Lane Kiffin and finished 8-5, their worst record since 2001. Barkley threw 26 more touchdowns, but questions still remained as to whether he was the answer to USC’s current problems.
For Barkley, 2011 was his defining year. Ineligible once again for the postseason, Barkley and the Trojans lost an early game at Arizona State and then lost a triple-overtime heartbreaker to the Andrew Luck-led Stanford Cardinal.
But it was after that when the legend of Matt Barkley formed.
He led USC to wins in the rest of its games, including an on-the-road upset over then-No. 4 ranked Oregon. He defeated UCLA 50-0 and finished sixth place in the Heisman Trophy voting. He was a third-team All-American and set a conference record for single-season touchdowns with 39. Expected to be a top-five pick in the 2012 NFL draft, people presumed that Barkley’s collegiate career was over. He would finish with 80 career touchdown passes — a solid number, but not enough to break records. He would be a three-year starter who won games but didn’t lead the Trojans to the promised land.
During December 2011, Barkley held a press conference to announce his intention to leave USC, once again leaving the Trojans in disarray.
Except he didn’t announce his intent to leave. He instead said he had “unfinished business.” That was when Barkley ‘s legend solidified.
The school record for touchdown passes was clearly within reach, seeing as he was only 19 away from tying Leinart when the season started. The fact that he was going to break the record is unimportant; it’s the way in which he did it.
If Barkley had left USC for the NFL, not only would he not have set the records he set Saturday, but USC would have been in disrepair. With all of the players coming back from a potent offense, the most important piece of a potential national title contender would be gone, leaving USC back at square one. But “Matty Trojan,” as Kiffin has affectionately called him, wanted to finish what he had started.
So when Woods caught that touchdown in the second quarter to give Barkley number 100, it meant far more than just a record. It didn’t just mean he had more scoring tosses than conference legends like Leinart, Dan Fouts, John Elway, Jim Plunkett and Gary Beban. It meant he had stayed all four years at USC. It meant he hadn’t left when he could have gone elsewhere and competed for a postseason bowl berth. It meant he had refused a chance at the NFL for the chance to be the greatest USC player of all time.
Most importantly, however, it meant through tough losses and sanctions, there was no other place he would rather be than at USC. Touchdown records are great, but the reason Barkley was here to break them is what matters. He did not give up and refused to quit on the school he loves, showing not only a desire to win but the true spirit of a Trojan.
Barkley is likely to throw a lot more touchdowns this year, considering USC might play in seven more games. But his 100th scoring toss should be a moment to remember forever. That perfect spiral represented dedication, heart and everything good about college football. And who knows when we will ever see that again.

In a rare Friday night match, the No. 1 USC men’s water polo team used a dominant first period to propel themselves to a 13-7 Moutain Pacific Sports Federation road win over No. 10 Long Beach State.
The win marks the Trojans’ 19th in a row, a streak that dates back to last season, as USC remains the nation’s only undefeated team.
The Trojans (17-0, 3-0) took a 4-0 lead after the first period and led 5-0 early in the second period against the 49ers (18-4, 0-1).
Two of the early five goals came from sophomore driver Kostas Genidounias, who led the Trojan scoring effort with a game-high five goals.
“Our defense dominated the first period,” Genidounias said. “They [LBSU] had a really slow two-meter, so we were able to score three goals early in the counterattack. Good defense always leads to good offense, and that was our main weapon.”
The biggest part of the offense was undoubtedly Genidounias, whose five goals tied a career high.
“Our guys did a really good job of getting [Genidounias] the ball in position, which doesn’t always happen,” USC coach Jovan Vavic said. “After his first goal, he was more aggressive and found his confidence.”
The only other Trojan with multiple goals was junior utility Mace Rapsey with two. Junior driver and the Trojans’ leading scorer Nikola Vavic scored one goal in the first period, keeping alive his streak of scoring in every game this season. The goal was the 139th of Nikola Vavic’s career, moving him into 11th on the Trojans’ all-time career scoring list.
The score indicates otherwise, but the Trojans let off the gas after their initial spurt and let the 49ers back into the game after running out to a 5-0 lead. Once up 6-1, the Trojans had a 6-on-5 opportunity in the second period with the chance to extend their lead to 7-1 and knock the 49ers down for the count.
Instead, USC turned the ball over and the 49ers quickly scored to pull to 6-2, a two-goal swing. Long Beach State scored early in the third period to pull within three goals at 7-4, but two quick goals from Genidounias and senior driver Tobias Preuss put the feisty 49ers away for good.
“If they had scored another to pull within two, we would have been in for a brawl,” Jovan Vavic said. “Luckily, Kostas scored a goal every time we needed one.”
The Trojans had one of their strongest opening periods all season, but the team knows that failing to put opponents away could become a bigger issue later in the season.
“We need to keep our concentration as the game goes on,” Genidounias said. “We gave them a few easy goals when we lost our focus. Friday, it was LBSU. But against a top opponent, our lack of focus might cost us a really great game down the road.”
Coach Vavic is proud of the way the Trojan offense finished shots on Friday, but he said there’s always room for improvement.
“We are not looking around to see what teammates are doing at all times,” he said. “We must be more aware.”
The Trojans are fully immersed in the midseason grind at this point, and this upcoming week will not do the team any favors.
USC will travel south to take on No. 6 UC Irvine on Thursday before returning home to host No. 5 University of Pacific and Cal Lutheran in a Saturday double-header, the squad’s first home matches after eight consecutive matches on the road.

USC’s offense has remained a point of contention for a sizable portion of the team’s fan base throughout much of the season.
The No. 10 Trojans either rely too heavily on their passing game, or coach Lane Kiffin is too conservative by calling for running plays in situations that scream for a throw, the critics insist.
Unparalleled · Though only playing a little more than a half, junior wide receiver Robert Woods passed Dwayne Jarrett on USC’s career receptions list after hauling in eight receptions for 132 yards and four touchdowns. – Carlo Acenas | Daily Trojan
But they were largely silenced Saturday. Senior quarterback Matt Barkley threw for 298 yards and six touchdowns to set a school and Pac-12 record for career touchdown passes, as USC (6-1, 4-1) ran past an overwhelmed Colorado team, 50-6.
With the victory, the Trojans, following a two-year postseason ban, are also bowl eligible for the first time since the 2009 season.
“The sky wasn’t falling,” said Kiffin during his post-game news conference. “Matt can still throw. He’s pretty good.”
That much was evident. Barkley’s career total for touchdown passes now stands at 102, moving past former USC signal caller and 2004 Heisman Trophy winner Matt Leinart, who had thrown for 99 during three seasons from 2003-06. Finishing 19 of 20, Barkley’s 95 percent completion rate also broke the conference record, previously held by former UCLA quarterback Rick Neuheisel.
“It’s special, it’s an honor,” Barkley said. “I’ll take credit, but I mean, I’ve been here for four years so hopefully we put some production up.”
Of his six touchdown tosses, four of them safely landed in the hands of junior wide receiver Robert Woods on plays of 39, 29, 17 and three yards over a span of just 2 1/2 quarters. Barkley’s 17-yard touchdown toss also marked a significant milestone for Woods, his 217th career catch, breaking the school’s all-time receptions record previously held by Dwayne Jarrett.
The third-year wideout finished with eight catches for 132 yards against the Buffaloes (1-6, 1-3).
“I grew up watching all those receivers ever since I understood USC football,” said Woods, whose four touchdown receptions also marked a single-game school record. “As I accomplished what I did today, I don’t see myself above them, I just see myself being a part of them as an elite group. I just want to follow in their footsteps, to be a great receiver at USC.”
USC, as a group, looked elite as well. And the squad looked fast, perhaps as the result of its use of a no-huddle, quicker-paced offense for much of the contest.
Barkley’s first touchdown, a 55-yard strike to sophomore wide receiver Marqise Lee, went over the middle of the field on the team’s second play from scrimmage just 50 seconds into the game. And by the nine-minute mark of the first quarter, the Trojans already led 19-0, energizing an announced sellout crowd of 83,274 at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum.
On the afternoon, the Trojans would finish with 458 yards of total offense, with 340 of them through the air, carving up an inexperienced and rattled secondary. The 50 points were also the highest single-game scoring total of the season.
“I don’t care what pace we actually play at,” said Lee, who finished with six catches for 103 yards and one touchdown, “as long as we do what we need to do when it’s time to do it.”
But as prolific as USC was offensively, it was again plagued by penalties. Entering the game, the team ranked 124th — dead last, in the Football Bowl Subdivision — in penalties per game with 10. On Saturday, the Trojans were penalized nine times for 90 yards, allowing the Buffaloes to keep some of their drives alive.
During the first quarter, on Colorado’s first drive of the game, redshirt freshman Anthony Sarao was called for a personal foul penalty, helping the Buffaloes inch further downfield all the way to the 21-yard line before an ill-advised throw by quarterback Jordan Webb was intercepted by senior safety Drew McAllister in the end zone. On the day, USC forced six turnovers, including two other interceptions and three recovered fumbles.
Later in the half, freshman defensive tackle Leonard Williams was penalized and subsequently ejected for punching a Colorado offensive player — classified as a flagrant foul that will be subject to review by conference officials, according to a school spokesman. It was not, though, deemed  “fighting,” which would warrant an automatic suspension.
Though replays failed to establish what prompted Williams’ punch, teammates said Williams claimed he was spat on.  The penalties and Williams’ outburst prompted Kiffin to lecture his team on discipline before the Trojans retreated to the locker room for halftime.
“We looked really undisciplined,” Kiffin said. “I felt bad for our fans, I felt bad for our former players. It was taking away from a really special day.”
Next weekend, USC travels to Tucson to square off against Arizona. With three of its five remaining games to be played at the Coliseum, it will be the last time the Trojans leave Southern California during the regular season.
“We play one week at a time,” Kiffin said. “We go out of L.A. for the last time this year. We have to get back to work.”
[…] extra point gone awry in the first quarter of USC’s 50-6 victory over Colorado last Saturday serves as just the latest example of the Trojans’ alarming lapse in judgment when it comes to […]

Former Indiana Sen. Evan Bayh, speaking to a group of about 25 students, faculty and staff in the Widney Alumni House on Friday, advocated for more bipartisanship and compromise in American politics.
During a private luncheon hosted by the USC Schwarzenegger Institute for State and Global Policy, Bayh spoke and answered questions for nearly an 1 1/2 hours on topics ranging from China to passing a budget. Bayh, a moderate Democrat who sits on the institute’s board of advisers, retired from the Senate in 2011 after his second term because of gridlock and political polarization.
Bayh emphasized the importance of working together and crossing party lines to pass legislation. The former senator said when his father served as a Democratic senator from 1963 to 1981, members of both parties would meet regularly. More recently, however, Bayh said it has become extremely rare for Republican and Democratic legislators to meet together for lunch, although both groups caucus separately to discuss policy each week.
“[There were] only three times in 12 years that everyone got together to work on something substantively,” Bayh said.
This comment incited several reactions and comments from guests.
“That was the most striking [thing Bayh said] — how all their meetings are separate,” said Global Director for the Schwarzenegger Institute Bonnie Reiss after the lunch.
Though Bayh said he is optimistic for the future, he believes legislators should be encouraged to work across the aisle more often.
“If you were in the private sector, this would be a job for industrial psychology or for systems design,” Bayh said.
According to Bayh, campaign finance and the polarization of the media are two issues contributing to the problem of responsible governance.
Though Bayh said he had never seen any outright corruption during his time in Washington, D.C., he said when individuals or special interests donate large sums, the money comes with strings attached. Bayh disagrees with the U.S. Supreme Court’s 2010 ruling in Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission, which said independent political donations from corporations and unions could not be regulated.
“The biggest problem, frankly, is the court’s interpretation of the Constitution,” Bayh said.
Still, Bayh said he believes the public is ultimately responsible for spurring campaign finance reform since current polls find that the public does not see a connection between campaign spending and effective government.
The luncheon guests included student leaders from political organizations in addition to faculty and staff involved in the new Schwarzenegger Institute, which launched in September.
“There sure are a lot of ‘presidents’ here today,” said former California State Assembly Speaker Robert Hertzberg.
At the lunch, Bayh also predicted President Barack Obama to win the election come Nov. 6, but by an extremely slim margin.
“If you put a gun to my head today, I’d say he’s going to be re-elected,” Bayh said, “[but] it’s going to be close.”
Though Bayh did not spend much time discussing the media, he did quip about how the campaigns have worked to negatively portray their opponents in swing states, such as Ohio.
“You’d be convinced that we have two criminal imbeciles running for president,” he said.
Reiss said Bayh serves an example of the type of leader the institute hopes to bring to campus.
“I’m proud when the institute can play a role in bringing leaders like Evan Bayh to an important leadership discussion … particularly when he is so knowledgeable about how to move forward and create the type of politics that serves the people best,” Reiss said.
Toward the end of the lunch, Hertzberg shared several stories about his attempts to foster bipartisanship in the California State Assembly, such as rearranging seating location and planning social events.
Hertzberg added that it is the responsibility of the younger generation to employ technology to fix the what’s broken in government, including the lack of involvement.
“The reason why government is failing is no one is participating,” Hertzberg said.
Bayh concluded his talk by underscoring the importance of working together to find a middle ground on different issues.
“We need to get back to the idea of principled compromise,” Bayh said. “We got to get back to the notion that some progress is better than none.”

Contestants at the USC Stevens Center for Innovation’s sixth annual Student Innovator Showcase spent Friday pitching their inventions and business ventures to attendees and judges.
“Cleatskins” · Reid Pearson, a 2011 graduate who majored in business adminstration, presented a product that keeps athletic cleats free of dirt. – Priyanka Patel | Daily Trojan
There were 106 projects submitted for the showcase, and the top 30 were offered the chance to compete.
The inventions ranged from a gum that reads glucose levels to an enzyme-replenishing product that would eliminate flushed skin after drinking alcohol. Retractable high heels and a website to help people move to job-rich rural communities also debuted at the competition.
“Overall, I thought the quality was amazing. Every year the quality goes up,” said Dr. Karen Kerr, a judge for the showcase.
The judges look for similar criteria in each projects: the originality of the idea, the passion of the team and the feasibility of the concept.
Ian Murphy, director of communications for the showcase, explained  he also looks for a “wow” factor in inventions.
“I love when there are things that I can say ‘I can’t believe that hasn’t been done before,’” Murphy said.
Participants said not many schools offer events of this value and caliber.
“I think it’s phenomenal. It’s incredible that [the USC Stevens Center] puts on these events. It’s very important for the campus ecosystem,” said Matt Lucido, a Marshall graduate student and showcase participant.
His product, Overlap, an app that helps users “bookmark” intriguing restaurants, made it to the final round of Fast Pitches.
“Now I’m just hoping for a successful launch,” Lucido said. “It’s a matter of others finding it useful.”
Murphy feels this event does a great job of putting the spotlight on the life of a student entrepreneur.
“It’s challenging and scary to put yourself out there — entrepreneurs don’t often get credit for it. Student entrepreneurs have to work like a student athlete. They have to learn to balance two separate lives,” Murphy said.
In the final rounds of the competition, the top-10 concepts were given the opportunity to “Fast Pitch” to a panel of judges for cash prizes. At the end of the day, Automatic Hand-Hygiene Verification won the biggest prize of $4,000 for Most Innovative product.
Jonathan Liu, a graduate student at the Keck School of Medicine and part of the team behind Automatic Hand-Hygiene Verification, said the team hopes to go through clinical trials to prove their invention works. Their product involves a sensor in hospitals to detect when doctors do not wash their hands before entering. They also hope to get the device patented.
Many participants agreed the most important part of the showcase was not the opportunity for prize money, but rather the networking possibilities and feedback.
“Someone may have a different twist on your idea that could make it better,” said Nick Cegelski, a freshman majoring in public relations who presented a concept where advertisers wofuld pay to take over customer’s cell phone wallpapers.
Breaking Heels, the project which designed retractable high heels, was presented by Jessica Risch, a second year masters of business administration student. Risch felt the experience alone helped her improve her project.
“I was surprised and honored to be a finalist. The feedback was really helpful for refining my idea,” Risch said. “It’s such a great opportunity to take your business idea and get great exposure to people in the field. It is great networking and I gained a lot of confidence in my pitch.”
Amitha Ganti, a graduate student at Keck and part of the Automatic Hand-Hygiene Verification team, said winning a prize was an added bonus to an already worthwhile event.
“All the inventions were awesome,” Ganti said. “It’s not just about winning, but being a part of it.”

The Undergraduate Student Government has passed a lower number of resolutions and amendments in Senate meetings than in past years at this point in the semester.
Student government resolutions are meant to represent the student body’s opinion on a particular issue,  and amendments to the constitution are meant to help the Senate run more efficiently. By Oct. 25, 2011, USG had passed two resolutions and two amendments to its constitution. This year, by comparison, the USG Senate has passed one amendment and one resolution.
But USG President Mikey Geragos, a senior majoring in public policy, management and planning, said he believes that the lower number of legislation passed is not an indication of a lack of resolve in this year’s senate.
“We’re not trying to push quantity this year,” Geragos said. “We’re trying to push quality, and I think we’ve done that very successfully.”
Some priorities for USG this year include bringing a greater amount of sustainability on campus and gauging students’ interests in new hospitality services, such as Trojan Grounds and the renovated dining halls.
USG Vice President Vinnie Prasad, a senior majoring in psychology and economics, said the lower number of resolutions reinforces this administration’s redirected efforts to have its senators complete thorough research before they present resolutions because it would impact and benefit the student body more.
“We really encourage the senators to come up with some really interesting data that tells a coherent story and has a logical argument that would eventually lead to some exciting resolutions for the student body to benefit from,” Prasad said. “We never want to waste energy on something that students do not want.”
In previous years, the Senate has also used forums to solicit student opinions. Last October, USG hosted forums about a possible smoking ban on campus and one about implementing the “We Are Considerate” campaign, which aims to help regulate bikes on campus and which resulted in the new bike lanes at the beginning of this semester. This year no such meetings have been held, although forums on the university’s new health center and information technology services are scheduled for November.
Geragos attributes the later dates of the student forums to the additional research senators have done to adequately prepare.
“Resolutions are keeping pace and are exceeding what they have in the past years in regard to research,” Geragos said. “We are really trying to maintain integrity in our resolutions, so that may require looking into what other schools are doing, reaching out to more students — and all of that takes time.”
USG Speaker Pro Tempore Matthew Arkfeld, a junior majoring in East Asian area studies, said he believes the delayed legislation represents the increased efforts of the student government’s senators. Currently, he’s working with other Greek senators to raise awareness of sustainability on campus, such as by encouraging the recycling of Solo cups at tailgates and on The Row.
“We’re doing a good job with getting the ball rolling,” Arkfeld said. “A senator’s role is basically to go see what is working, internally and externally. We have to stay well informed and take all of that information and transmit it so everyone is on the same page. Right now there are a lot of balls rolling and soon more resolutions will come from the many steps we’re taking.”
Arkfeld said the Senate will pass more resolutions toward the end of this semester and in the spring semester.
“It’s hard because there’s a lot that’s built up,” Arkfeld said. “We have a lot on our plate right now and writing a resolution and starting events takes a while.”
This year’s administration has also placed a greater emphasis on internal efficiency among the senators, according to Geragos.
“The relationships and cooperation that are happening are light-years beyond what have happened in the past [administrations],” Geragos said. “That is just a sign of the amazing people we have in the office.”
Though he admits to some slow movement during the first few weeks of school, Geragos insists he is confident in the Senate’s ability to provide the best resources to the student body.
“The senators have done a lot more work than anyone expected or anyone foresaw them doing compared to last year,” Geragos said.
“I heartily accept the motto,—’That government is best which governs least;’ and I should like to see it acted up to more rapidly and systematically. Carried out, it finally amounts to this, which also I believe,—’That government is best which governs not at all;’ and when men are prepared for it, that will be the kind of government which they will have.” —Henry David Thoreau

Active members of Chabad at USC gathered together for the groundbreaking of the new renovations to the Chabad House. The event featured a home-cooked brunch, a self-guided tour of what changes will be made to the house and speeches by leaders in the Jewish community.
Groundbreaking · Students, administrators and supporters of the Rohr Chabad Jewish Student Center at USC gather Sunday to celebrate the start of construction on a new building. – Devra Traiman | Daily Trojan
The ceremony marked the first effort to fundraise for the 125-year-old house’s renovations. Because of the history behind the home, not many foundational changes can be made: The only option is expansion while keeping the look of the inside the same.
Chabad has been at USC for 13 years, and has used the house for the past 10; however, the house is now in a state of disrepair and requires a good amount of maintenance.
Some of the plans include extending the kitchen out by eight feet, tripling the size of the dining hall and adding a large porch on the second level for social gatherings. The ceremony featured posters of computer models of the new house, as well as proposed floor plans.
The renovation costs could total than $3 million, so leaders at Chabad are reaching out to the Jewish community to raise funds for the hopefully year-long construction project.
Some students who frequent the Chabad house, like Jordan Harmon, a senior majoring in fine arts, said they fully support the renovations.
“It’s necessary because the bigger the Chabad house, the more Jews that can come; it deserves help, the people here are amazing and they need a new place to create Jewish life,” Harmon said.
Chabad’s primary weekly event is their Shabbat, held every Friday night for all students or community members who wish to eat, socialize and celebrate their faith.
Many students rave about the delicious home-cooked food made by Rabbi Dov Wagner’s wife, Runya Wagner. This warm welcome usually sees the dining room packed to capacity, with students overflowing outside the house.
Chabad leaders hope the renovations can help them successfully cater to the school’s growing Jewish presence.
“The dining room is packed all the time, there’s no room and they’re really splitting tables,” said Eric Pakravan, a junior majoring in business administration. “If you need to leave, the whole room has to stand up so you can leave the dining room, so [renovation] is definitely very needed, and hopefully it’ll bring more people to Chabad in the future.”
The open arms of the Wagners and the Jewish Greek life in fraternities like Alpha Epsilon Pi and Sigma Alpha Mu have helped the Jewish community at USC become very close, and religious leaders hope this renovation will add to this relationship.
“More than other religious groups on campus, Chabad really provides a family setting and a home away from home,” said Varun Soni, dean of religious life at USC. “To create this incredibly nurturing and supportive environment, we really do need a bigger space here.”
Though raising the money will no doubt be a challenge, the Chabad House sees the renovation as necessary to acheive their dreams.
“That’s what we’re doing here today: Dov and I had our hopes and dreams, populations and balance sheets, but ultimately we’re doing a ground-breaking,” Runya Wagner said. “Not because we’ve got the commitments in hand, or the money in the bank, but because we know it needs to be done. And if it needs to be done, it will be done. That I can guarantee you.”
After 125 years, it’s definitely time for renovations/additions.

Social media dominates almost every element of communication for our generation. It is even acceptable to use some names as verbs in colloquial speech: “Instagram that view, bro,” or “Nice to meet you, Facebook me later!” are phrases often overheard on a college campus.
The presence of social media is nothing new but, if used correctly, it could be one of the greatest inventions of man. Move over, sliced bread.
In the everyday life of a college student, logging on to Facebook is as common an occurrence as going to class or checking email. It’s necessary. How else do we stay updated on when there’s an earthquake, the latest Internet sensations and what everyone is having for lunch?
This brings me to my point, however: Are we using Facebook correctly? If there’s such a thing as dining etiquette and library etiquette, why isn’t there Facebook etiquette?
Though placing so much significance on a social media website might seem pointless — it’s just Facebook, after all, not the next great American novel — the large role that social media, especially Facebook, now plays in our lives should be taken into consideration.
Since it is such a popular tool, used and analyzed by us every day, it should be utilized to its utmost capacity. Rather than scrolling past useless photos of someone’s food, it’s a nice change when someone posts a thought-provoking article or a socially-aware music video. There’s so much potential in a website offering the opportunity to endlessly share and observe, so why don’t we embrace it in a more meaningful manner?
Before you post that status update, do us all a favor and spell check your writing. Proper grammar and correct spelling go a long way, especially for a university student. Likewise, ask yourself whether you’re actually saying something of importance.
Even if a status is “what’s on your mind,” resist writing passive-aggressive statuses, or ones complaining about overly personal problems. Nobody likes a self-righteous status merely seeking validation. It would be also nice if more Facebook users refrained from sharing uninformed political opinions or unsolicited religious advice.
Facebook can be a treacherous digital frontier. Many innocent users have signed on to their profiles to see that their walls have been covered with spam attacks. Private messaging exists for a reason, so don’t be afraid to use it.
Don’t get me wrong. A cleverly written status about nothing in particular can be pretty entertaining. But if we’re going to be honest, not everyone is clever enough to pull these off. If you find yourself doubting whether more than two people will like what you have to say, reconsider.
Speaking of “likes,” the process of hitting a miniature thumbs up is a ridiculously ambiguous action. What does it mean? Are you supporting what I’ve written, or was that a facetious click? Clicking a button rather than articulating in words how we feel removes us from the subject and invalidates our opinion. Try to refrain from mindlessly “liking” the first photo that pops up on your news feed. Instead, carefully consider how you feel about a person’s post and try to express that feeling in words. If this seems like too much, then “like” sparingly.
At this point in our lives, it is unnecessary to announce to the digital world that you’re in a relationship only to change back to single within a month or two. This is college, we get it; people date, they break up and they move on. Facebook is not the place to give a play by play of your romantic life, otherwise it would be called Datebook. Unless you’re engaged, married or truly committed, hold off on the Facebook romance.
One of the strangest aspects of modern social interaction, thanks to Facebook, is that we can recognize people we’ve never actually met in person before. This happens more than most people would care to admit, especially within such a well-connected community like USC. We shake hands with someone at a party who shares so many mutual friends  that they’re inevitably a presence in our news feed, but we hesitate to acknowledge we know of them at the risk of sounding creepy.
If everyone experiences and partakes in this “creepy” behavior, however, we should acknowledge it rather than hide it. Who knows, admitting you know something about someone could actually spark a connection, and you could make yourself a new friend  — or more.
We constantly chastise others for “stalking,” yet everyone knows that this is an integral part of using Facebook. To deny that you haven’t meticulously looked through someone’s profile pictures to understand their personality would be a lie. Eveyone does it. On the other hand, we also can’t expect to understand everything about a person based on the way his or her profile looks. You can’t judge a book by its cover, so why judge a Facebook user by his or her cover photo?
If there’s anything to take away from this article, it’s that Facebook has the potential to be a valuable socializing tool, if people would learn to use it more wisely. Don’t be afraid to send a friend request if you just met someone. And don’t wish me a happy birthday on my wall unless you sincerely mean it.

Politics and television have a long history together.
M.A.S.H. was one of the first political shows, focusing in its later seasons on the dark horrors of war and the necessity (or lack thereof) of the United States’ occupation of Korea. The West Wing brought its audience into both the White House and the conflicted minds of the fictional politicians that roamed its hallways. And The Wire all-too-realistically transposed the corruption of government with the police and schoolteachers suffering the consequences of cutbacks.
Homeland, recently in the news for ending the three-year reign of Breaking Bad and Mad Men’s Emmy domination, is next in line to continue this legacy of outstanding political television.
Airing new episodes of its second season Sunday nights on Showtime, the show definitely deserves viewers’ attentions. Homeland is special for many reasons, but mainly the stellar performances from the two leads: Claire Danes and Damian Lewis’ portrayals of the dynamic characters result in consistently engaging storytelling that doesn’t rely on gimmicks or cliffhangers, but pure substance.
The two lead actors carry Homeland: Both won an Emmy for their performances as the two compelling main characters of the show’s groundbreaking first season.
Danes plays Carrie Mathison, a CIA operative with some issues, to say the least. Carrie is composed of equal parts mania, charisma and intelligence, which makes for a combustible combination in her line of work. As many of this generation’s most celebrated programs have centered on a flawed male character — Don Draper, Walter White and Tony Soprano, to name a few — it is refreshing to see a female lead with such complexities and imperfections.
Lewis plays Nicholas Brody, a U.S. Marine that was captured by terrorist forces in the Middle East and held as a prisoner of war for eight years. After finally being rescued, Brody returns home to his family and his country — both of which have changed dramatically during his absence. The CIA wants to use him as a poster boy for the continuation of the war, but Carrie sees him as a threat. From here, a cat-and-mouse game of secrets and surveillance ensues with captivating onscreen results.
Both characters are emotionally damaged and deeply troubled — Carrie eats nothing but unflavored yogurt and Chinese take-out and seemingly cares about nothing more than protecting the nation from another terrorist attack. The show depicts her as woman who will go to any lengths to find out the truth. She uses her brain as a tool for manipulation and her sexuality as a tool for stress release. Carrie definitely isn’t the prototypical female character an audience is supposed to unequivocally like and relate to. This complexity creates a multi-layered character that, thanks in large part because of Danes’ consistently remarkable performances, is simultaneously a hero and a head case.
Brody is also severely damaged because of many years living inside an al-Qaida hole. Lewis, best known from HBO’s Band of Brothers, exhibits a performance that is subtle and enthralling. His character, in particular, develops increasingly and only becomes more captivating from episode to episode.
Homeland has established itself as one of the best shows on television because, in conjunction with great acting, it consistently surprises its audience with its timing. Whereas most programs tend to save their main conflict resolutions for the season’s end, Homeland has remained unpredictable throughout, creating an environment where the viewer doesn’t know what to expect or when to expect it. Through the first two episodes of the new season, it’s safe to say that the show has not lost its touch or its ability to drop your jaw directly to the floor.
The second season continues the show’s established penchant for extremely tense and thrilling drama along with intelligent humor and serious political overtones. The season premiere, for one, deals with political themes including foreign affairs policies and CIA operations in the Middle East.
Intelligent political television is especially important in 2012, as the nation will be electing a president in the coming weeks. Though Homeland does not openly deal with election-prevalent political subjects like party dynamics, it does force its audience to question the motivations behind administrative decisions and the truth (or, again, the lack thereof) of statements issued by the government. And asking those questions is never a bad thing.
Homeland continuously impresses and surprises. Its characters are complex and thought-provoking, and its political content is especially important during this election year. Viewers should definitely pay attention to this intense and thought-provoking drama — they don’t want to risk missing out on something truly special.
 
Catch Homeland on Showtime on Sundays at 10 p.m.

In the backdrop of an American election season defined by politicians’ misleading rhetoric and incurable apathy among voters, the documentary A Whisper to a Roar manages to make its voice heard.
Democracy discussion · (left to right) Prince Moulay Hicham, Ben Moses, Adriy Schecchenko and Larry Diamond reflect on Roar. – Katherine Montgomery | Daily Trojan
Released to the L.A. public on Oct. 19 at the Laemmle NoHo 7 Theatre, the documentary focuses on the stories of five countries around the world and their struggles to forge a path to liberal democracy despite opposition by their governments.
The documentary focuses on Ukraine, Venezuela, Egypt, Malaysia and Zimbabwe and, near the end of the film, on Tunisia. The writer, director and producer of  A Whisper to a Roar, Ben Moses, believes that it was important to show these non-Western countries and their fight for democracy.
“We wanted to show how various influences caused autocrats or leaders to behave in certain ways,” Moses said at an Oct. 3 screening of the film.
This early screening of A Whisper to a Roar  also happened to take place the night of the first presidential debate between Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney and President Barack Obama, at the Director’s Guild of America Theater. A question and answer panel followed the screening, where Moses, Larry Diamond, Prince Moulay Hicham, Andriy Shevchenko and moderator Mary Hart of Entertainment Tonight discussed their perspectives on the film.
Though the filmmakers did not purposefully schedule the release of the film to coincide with the debate, the close proximity of the two events added a fresh perspective to A Whisper to a Roar. Before viewing the film, the audience watched the debate, then witnessed seeing the other side of democracy in Moses’ documentary. This contrast emphasized the recurring message of a democracy being only as strong as the people willing to fight for its vitality.
To enhance the greater meaning of A Whisper to a Roar,  Moses incorporated the points of view and expertise of producers and consultants from different fields, backgrounds and cultures. Among the producers were executive producer Diamond, a Stanford professor and senior fellow at the Hoover Institution and at the Freeman Spogli Institute for International Studies, Prince Moulay Hicham, the uncle of the modern, independent nation of Morocco and Lynne Moses, a co-founder of Appleseed Entertainment and experienced documentarian.
During the screenings, Prince Moulay Hicham reminded the audience that democracy was plausible for people of all backgrounds.
“The film is about the fundamental conflict between human nature and the human spirit,” Hicham said.
The filmmakers’ diversity helped achieve the lofty goal of the documentary: showing that though it is often thought of as a Western concept, democracy can take root anywhere if people are willing to fight for it. By utilizing quotes from famous philosophers, such as Aristotle, Voltaire and Margaret Mead, and introducing narratives from those involved in democratic movements, the documentary cohesively shows all sides to the struggle. With these stylistic choices, the audience can better understand how in some nations freedom is not a right, but instead a privilege that is continually being insured.
A Whisper to a Roar further emphasizes the idea that a foreign government only changes when a country’s whole system — not simply its leader — is fundamentally changed. The film intensifies the importance of building a passionate and invested voter base in non-democratic countries.
Still, Moses is certain the documentary’s call to action will ring true for individuals in the audience.
“The people, when they get together, can take charge,” Moses said. “They can stop anything that’s going on when they get together and they’re not afraid. One person is powerless, but a million people have all the power.”
After watching the documentary, viewers can see that around the world, people young and old, conservative and liberal are fighting to have their voices heard in the political arena, yet are being hindered because of autocratic leaders. Despite the adversity they face, they continue their mission of making their nation more free. This level of dedication can easily apply to a younger audience that feels as if its voice is not adequately being heard. By creating this parallel with young people and the ongoing presidential election, the documentary has the ability to inspire its audience, especially younger members, into believing in their individual importance in safeguarding democracy again.
As American citizens we can easily tune out from the political rhetoric and become dispassionate about our rights because we envision them always being there. Moses, however, wants his documentary to serve as a cautionary tale for Americans.
“Just because there is a democracy doesn’t mean that everything is OK,” Moses said. “You have to work to keep it. Freedom will come and go but you have to work to keep it. We always have to pay attention. We always have to vote.”
A Whisper to a Roar, as a result, is the perfect film to view before casting a ballot Nov. 6 because it reminds everyone that in some countries that ballot is a hard fought privilege only given to those who believe in the ideals of democracy.

Last week marked the one-year anniversary of the end of a Northern California prison’s hunger strikes and a consequent deal struck between prisoners and the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation. At Pelican Bay State Prison in Crescent City, Calif., prisoners observed the anniversary by writing an open letter to Gov. Jerry Brown expressing their frustration at a lack of change in the last year and calling on him to end the indiscriminate placement of inmates in solitary confinement for years on end.
Yiwen Fu | Daily Trojan
Though it is undoubtedly necessary for some inmates to be placed in solitary confinement to protect the safety of prison officials and other inmates, the policy is flawed in that it leaves prisoners undeserving of such punishment in solitary confinement for years. This is not just a problem at Pelican Bay, but at prisons across the state. Brown must take action to reform Pelican Bay to set a precedent that further prevents the violation of basic civil liberties in all U.S. prisons, especially in those in Los Angeles.
The letter written by the prisoners in Pelican Bay’s Security Housing Unit, or SHU, expresses their frustrations with the slow progress on prison reform. The changes they requested are not unreasonable, and a failure to implement these changes represents the state’s failure to protect two constitutional rights: due process of law and the right to not be subjected to cruel and unusual punishment.
One of the prisoners’ core requests is that no individual should be placed in solitary confinement without extensive administrative review, and that those who are sent there must be given a fixed sentence. The Center for Constitutional Rights claims that anything less than these requests amounts to a violation of the Eighth Amendment, which grants protection against cruel and unusual punishment, and the Fifth Amendment, which promises the right to due process of law.
According to the CCR, which filed a federal class-action lawsuit on behalf of the prisoners last May, SHU inmates spend 22 ½ to 24 hours a day in a tiny windowless cell without access to basic human contact. Such conditions have proven to have a devastating psychological impact on individuals held in such conditions for a prolonged period, and at Pelican Bay, some inmates have been held in this way for more than 20 years.
This is not a problem contained only within Pelican Bay State Prison. Solitary confinement conditions are also far from perfect in L.A. County jails — one ex-lawyer, for example, was held in solitary confinement in the L.A. County Men’s Central Jail for 14 months without being charged for a crime.
Even more disturbingly, many SHU prisoners have not broken prison rules and therefore do not deserve to be held in such a manner. For example, prison officials can take even the most basic actions and turn them into a solitary confinement sentence for affiliation with a prison gang. Shane Bauer, an observer of Pelican Bay’s SHU who has experienced solitary confinement, told the Los Angeles Times that some “evidence” of prison gang activity includes pictures of Malcolm X, possession of Niccolo Machiavelli’s The Prince and the use of the words “tio” and “hermano,” according to the Los Angeles Times.
It is one thing to place an inmate who has killed another inmate or assaulted a guard into solitary confinement for the safety of others, but arbitrarily locking an inmate away without judicial oversight for possessing a book remains a glaring inconsistency within California’s prison system that has largely been ignored up to this point.
Unfair solitary confinement also draws attention to a larger problem in California prisons: abuse by prison guards. The L.A. County Sheriff’s Department, for one, was sued in January by the American Civil Liberties Union for inmate abuse, and the case has yet to be decided. The fact that such a prominent city’s sheriff’s department has been sued multiple times by the ACLU and investigated by the FBI should be a source of enormous public outrage. But the issue remains at the margins of the media and public consciousness, further eroding the ideals all Americans’ constitutional rights are founded upon.
There is no doubt that solitary confinement is necessary for some inmates for safety reasons, and most of the time those inmates are far from model citizens. But if a nation so dedicated to constitutional rights and civil liberties does not protect the rights of all its citizens, no matter how morally defunct they are, it loses its credibility to a certain extent.
Because of this, it is vital that grievances made by people like the prisoners in solitary at Pelican Bay and the allegedly abused inmates in L.A. County jails are addressed, if not for their sake then for the sake of being regarded as a civilized society.

this article is laughable, it sounds like the writer is dating an inmate!
or maybe a family member. why are YOU here what is Your interest?  I’M here because i have a very good friend in the pelican bay SHU.

lol…real bad ass on the internet huh? speak that in person to an inmate or someone who’s been locked up….like me. why even come to sites one has no interest in except to run your mouth. these men are being mistreated,tortured even by the constant deprivations. end of story,oh and gabriel? go find another site to troll on.
There are men at Pelican Bay who have been in solitary confinement for over 25 years.  Solitary confinement used to be used for bad behaviour, but California uses  is as a method of control.  The men are not asking to be released, but to do their time in the mainline.  To have them in solitary confinement for years on end for the sake of having control is barbaric.  If other countries did it, we would frown on it, but here in California, it’s the norm.
Governor Brown should step up to the plate and make the necessary changes we look for in a leader.  Not only for the sake of the inmates, but for the savings to tax payers as having inmates in SHU is more costly than having them on the mainline.  Not to mention the mental health issues caused to these men from being held in isolation for years on end.
Prisoners’ rights must be protected!  What rights?  Study before sounding off.  Prisoners are, and should be, deprived of rights as a consequence of being adjuged a felon.  Your argument sounds like many I’ve read that illegal entry into the United States should be declared legal.
Fight On!
JLH
When government ignores civil rights, their moral and legal responsibility to provide and protect prisoners with humane conditions, we are on the slippery slope of anarchy. This SHU concept is out of control. It is no longer what it was when designed. Internal forces have changed it and shaped it to be more punitive than necessary. I know, I was one of the few administrators that had an opportunity to work it ground up.. Rights must be protected… otherwise we all suffer as mankind.

Last week, another media organization announced the pending end of their print production. This time it was Newsweek magazine’s turn to abandon its printed product and hit the web.
Newsweek editor Tina Brown announced last Thursday that the December issue will be the final print edition of a magazine that has documented 79 years of American life since its launch in 1933. Taking its place will be an all-digital magazine called Newsweek Global.
The fact that such a widely read magazine has given up on print media sounds dire, and even heartbreaking, to lovers of print journalism. But as inevitable as the end of print media seems, students — as media consumers who grew up with both print and digital media — are uniquely positioned to promote a hybrid journalism industry that draws greatness from a blend of print and digital media.
With Newsweek’s online transition, the magazine has become another one of the many cases illustrating a losing battle between traditional print news outlets and the web. According to The Wall Street Journal,  Newsweek’s circulation has dropped from 3.1 million readers in 2005 to about 1.5 million in June, while the quantity of advertising pages has plunged more than 80 percent in the same time frame, leading to recent annual losses of roughly $40 million.
In short, it appears that the web’s real-time updates have been preferred over Newsweek’s outdated print cycles, and financial losses have mounted with less-than-modest growth of advertising pages and revenue. With one glance at such steep statistics, it is clear that Newsweek simply could not keep up profits in an increasingly digital industry.
That’s not much of a surprise, as it is clear that the media can’t stay rooted in its strictly paper past — the benefits of going online are obvious. The decline of print media such as Newsweek and U.S. News & World Report has demonstrated public preference all too well. Online news is quicker, more accessible and more convenient than the likes of television, newspapers, magazines and radio. Whole forests will be saved without the production, delivery and waste disposal that accompanies print media. News can now be accessed almost anywhere with a wireless connection, and breaking news alerts come in by the minute. Sharing information with friends and staying connected has only gotten easier for a vast number of people.
But though all arrows might point to a teetering end for print journalism, the point of no return has not passed yet. Though Brown told  The New York Times that “no one single person can reverse [a] trend” heading toward a digital future, she’s missing something. A nation of readers — young readers especially — can change this trend.
Students have grown up during the transition from print to digital media. They are the ones who know the traditional value of print and slick convenience of online news. Students might be touted as lovers of all-things-online, but they are the youngest generation that grew up while print still held a dominant role in the world. Because of this unique background, students must take on the responsibility to not let print fall behind, but instead take a stand for the best elements of print and bring them into the digital realm.
Print media boasts unique advantages that should not be abandoned just for the speed and convenience of newer technology.
The ritual of reading a newspaper at the breakfast table, in a cafe or on the subway and the intimate, natural feel of a physical newspaper or magazine cannot be reproduced online. And though it’s true that the release of print media tends to be paced more slowly than with digital, the rise of mistakes made or false claims eagerly released online without proper fact-checking or editorial oversight makes a case for the time that print allows to verify  and develop a story.
It’s up to this generation of young adults to keep the best of print while pursuing the sweeping advances of the digital world. If not, an invaluable form of media might disappear on the watch of young people who have the collective strength to revive it and turn the journalism of the future into a blend of the best. It can be as easy as choosing to continue subscribing to your favorite newspaper or magazine or showing support by picking up copies of print media on campus.
Though Dec. 31 marks the last of the Newsweek that America has known for the last century, print media’s legacy is up to the students of today. In the years to come, the print industry does not follow a doomed trajectory. Just because the rise of digital media is inevitable does not mean that the fall of print media has to be as well.
