Isabel Castillo was looking for some excitement in her life. It was February, the height of cuffing season, and she had just gotten out of a long-term relationship two months prior. Castillo, a senior majoring in journalism, had never tried dating apps before. But she figured: Why not give women-friendly Bumble a shot? 
Prior to the onset of the pandemic, the online dating market was shrinking. However, as people were driven indoors in March, increased feelings of isolation led to a spike in online dating, with Dating.com reporting that 82% of its single members have turned to virtual platforms for romance to boost their well-being. 
After a few weeks of swiping, Castillo wanted to meet a match she had been chatting with, but it was March and pandemic restrictions were already in place in Los Angeles. They agreed to what felt like a safe date — a socially-distanced, outdoor walk where they could wear masks the whole time. 
“Then we decided to hang out in his apartment,” Castillo said. “We kind of maintained social distancing. But obviously that didn’t happen [after] like 10 minutes.”
College has long provided an apt environment for young people looking to explore their sexuality, courtesy of the freedom afforded by living on one’s own. Closely situated dorm rooms and lack of supervision help make college campuses a hotspot for hookup culture, budding relationships and genuine reflection on one’s identities. 
Unlike the NYC Health Department, which became the first to issue guidelines for sex during the pandemic, and the Los Angeles Department of Public Health, which replicated the guidelines, USC Student Health did not issue anything regarding sexual health for students to adhere to during the pandemic. 
“We will look at it,” Chief Health Officer Dr. Sarah Van Orman said in a student media briefing Aug. 13. “It’s a tricky area because on some level it’s simple, right? That it’s just like everything else [in the pandemic], but on some level, it’s complicated.”
With the University’s lack of sexual health guidance amid the pandemic, students are left to circumvent dating and hookup culture entirely on their own, often relying on their comfort levels to gauge what is safe or not rather than looking to recommended guidelines. Students like Castillo have become more experimentative in the ways they approach sex and romance, both on and off their screens.
Navigating sexual health
According to NYC Health, everyone is their own safest sex partner — masturbation is often recommended in place of sex. However, should anyone choose to have sex, Co-Medical Director and Faculty Physician of Internal Medicine Dr. Kimberly Tilley recommended they limit their circle of hookups and have sex with only consenting partners who can talk through the risks involved in physical intimacy — both sexually transmitted infections and COVID-19. 
“Part of the human experience is having relationships and exploring sexuality,” Tilley said. “We need to do it just like we do every other part in our life [in the pandemic] and figure out ways to do it … I think you have to take into consideration what your risks are, and what amount of risk you can tolerate.”
As for navigating sexual intercourse, NYC Health recommends making sex a “little kinky” by being more creative with sexual positions that do not require face-to-face contact.
In accordance with NYC Health, Van Orman recommended students use facial coverings such as masks and avoid face-to-face contact as much as possible during sex. Additionally, Van Orman said students should generally avoid oral sex and use condoms and dental dams to prevent any risk of transmission during sex. According to NYC Health, using these during oral or anal sex can minimize contact with saliva, semen or feces, from which the virus has been detected in some COVID-19 patients. 
“There’s not a great answer, because by definition, sexual activities are close contact and really kind of put you at risk in terms of being in the same space with somebody,” Van Orman said at a student media briefing Sept. 24. “But that does seem to be the one kind of risk mitigation thing we can recommend.”
However, Tilley said if students understand and are OK with how many contacts their partners have in other aspects of their lives, she sees no need in taking these “kind of awkward” measures such as wearing a mask during sex. 
“If you’re having more sexual partners, or if for some reason you’re at higher risk for complications from COVID, then I think it’s reasonable to take some of those considerations into account,” Tilley said. “But there are no studies that show that a mask during sex is going to decrease transmission because clearly, there’s probably not physical distancing.”
According to Tilley, having and maintaining only one intimate partner brings “pretty low” risk. However, Van Orman said that intimate partners that do not live together in the same housing situation have to understand that their social “bubble” expands every time they arrange to meet.
“If I live in one apartment and my intimate partner lives in another apartment, those two households are linked,” Van Orman said Aug. 13. “So anything that happens to anybody in one of those households happens to people in the other households, so people need to think about that in terms of their exposure group.”
The problem lies in anonymous hookups, which Van Orman doesn’t recommend. When students have sexual encounters with partners whose names or contact information are not known, Student Health’s contact tracing efforts become compromised. 
According to Tilley, when Student Health first contacts a student who tested positive for COVID-19, staff will ask for all of the contacts that student interacted with in the past 48 hours. If the student doesn’t know their partner’s name or anything about them at all, then there is nothing Student Health can do, Tilley said.
Students can maintain a remote, online relationship and take the necessary precautions like getting tested before meeting in person, Van Orman said, but there is no perfect way to reduce the risk of contracting the virus.
Risky business
For Castillo, finding romance during quarantine was a happy coincidence as she had spent her days in her pajamas with chocolate “all day, every day” and wasn’t looking for anyone to disturb the peace. She also wanted to be considerate of her roommate, who is immunocompromised.  
“I was mainly concerned for her, not necessarily for myself — that was kind of more of an afterthought,” Castillo said. “My main thing is like I can’t get sick because I don’t want to get her sick.”
Similarly, while she’d normally be going on dates and having casual sex, Taylor, a junior majoring in industrial and systems engineering who preferred to use a pseudonym, said she hasn’t been on a date in months. Taylor came out as bisexual just three weeks before lockdown and looked forward to meeting new people and exploring her sexuality more. 
But socializing has been difficult: Taylor is immunocompromised and has only seen her roommate and three friends consistently during this school year. She vets potential dates on Instagram to see if they’re taking social distancing protocols seriously. If she chooses to go on a date, she said she’d need it to be outside, with masks on and socially distanced to protect herself — no exceptions. 
One dating app match invited Taylor to some virtual dates, but it didn’t work out. They didn’t have much to say, especially without the normal conversation topics that fill awkward pauses during an in-person date like comments about a movie or meal. 
But just because physical intimacy can often feel impossible doesn’t mean students have written off sexual intimacy. Instead, Taylor and other students have turned to sexting. 
“I was at this point where I was so lonely that it was my only way to kind of fulfill that certain desire,” she said. “And it ended up getting to kind of an unhealthy point of like I was getting texts from people and having no idea who I just sent a photo to or who I sent a dirty text to, and that’s very much not my character. That’s not how I’d usually go about dating.”
The struggle of spicing things up
The pandemic has also stalled Nicholas Guzman’s dating life. Guzman, a junior majoring in international relations, would normally be talking with guys on Tinder and occasionally meeting up for dates. 
In July, he decided to meet a match for a socially distanced date. They went on two walks, but the experience was nothing out of a Nicholas Sparks’ romance novel.
Guzman felt safe, because he knew they’d be outside, and due to the circumstances, at the goodbye mark, Guzman remembers saying: “I had a good time, I’m just not going to hug you.”
The pair decided to keep talking, but not romantically. If they had continued dating, Guzman said it would’ve been difficult to keep things interesting: “Are we really just going to go on little walks like 100 times?” Restaurants, movie theaters and other dating conventions weren’t an option at the time.
When you’re coupled up
But for some, like juniors Abi Thomas, who is majoring in creative writing, and Jayden Smith, who is majoring in political science, navigating dating during the pandemic has been a fun challenge.
Although they met a year ago, they began talking more seriously in mid-June, and road tripped back to USC from Illinois, solidifying their relationship before the start of the school year and at the height of the Memorial Day peak in coronavirus cases.
Their first date consisted of a takeout dinner in Thomas’ empty apartment. By apartment-hopping between their respective homes, venturing out for ice cream runs, taking long camping trips and drives through the winding Mulholland Drive, they’ve managed to still find fun, safe things to do as a couple.
“We’re both kind of homebodies,” Thomas said. “I guess the only thing is that we can’t go to a restaurant, which would be nice because that would be cool for like an anniversary or something.”
Megan, a sophomore majoring in computer science, and her boyfriend Sean, a senior majoring in computer engineering and computer science, have been in a long-distance relationship since March, around the time USC abruptly transitioned to virtual classes. For the past six months, they have been taking turns staying over at each other’s homes for around a week every two months. 
Every time they meet up in person, Megan said they have open discussions about the precautions they are each taking, such getting tested and wearing gloves and masks, and what risks could have been presented to them in the weeks prior.
“I try to get him COVID-tested before I see him, likewise the same for me,” she said. “It’s OK if we touch each other because we’re going to be breathing the same air the whole time is what we realized.”
During their visits, Megan said she and Sean acknowledge that they only get to see each other occasionally, so they try to make the most of their time together, usually by having sex multiple times throughout the week. The two have not adopted some of NYC Health’s guidelines such as wearing masks during sex because they have already taken the necessary precautions leading up to their time together, Megan said. 
With the pandemic, Megan said there has been somewhat a strain on intimacy; however, all of their interactions, whether they are in-person or online, have felt very intimate. 
“So it’s like, do we try to be intimate over FaceTime? Yes, we do,” Megan said. “Is that kind of weird and kind of feels like 21st century cybersexual? Yeah, it does. It’s very interesting to think about what in particular, what image I have of him that I’m sexualizing is really weird because so much is cyber.”
According to Megan, her relationship with Sean has progressed to more of a “nontraditional” college relationship, especially because it would accelerate significantly every time they visited each other. 
“Our relationship is sustainable overall just because of how open we are on the same page about everything, and how much time we take, emotionally dedicated to each other,” she said. 
For Castillo, online dating has allowed her to find a new best friend in the form of her partner, helping her navigate the emotional rollercoaster that is the pandemic. 
“We might not be able to go partying or go to bars, but we’d be having a nice picnic in the park and drink,” Castillo, who spends nearly every weekday with her boyfriend, said. “So it’s just like a different type of fun and I definitely think being in a relationship helps us get through this time.”

By this point, I’m sure we have all at least heard of J.K. Rowling’s “TERF Wars.” Some of us wish to forget them while others simply cannot get past them and Rowling refuses to capitulate. 
They escalated earlier this summer, when Rowling tweeted, “I know and love trans people, but erasing the concept of sex removes the ability of many to meaningfully discuss their lives.”  
Months later, she announced her upcoming novel “Troubled Blood” under her alias Robert Galbraith. Many critics have criticized its plot for being essentially transphobic, as it follows a man who cross-dresses to murder women. 
To say the least, it’s idiosyncratic how Rowling has called herself “empathetic to trans people.” This paradox opens the conversation beyond blatant transphobia to tokenization. Having trans friends does not immunize one from transphobia, just as being associated with any marginalized community does not effectively translate to a “free pass” to mistreating said community. 
Let’s make one thing clear: Calling Rowling a “bitch” is misogynistic, but the phrase “TERF,” or trans-exclusionary radical feminist, is not. It reflects her opinion that a woman is not a woman unless they menstruate. It reflects her upcoming novel that portrays trans people as violent and perpetuates harmful stereotypes that trans people are pedophiles who weaponize their identities to harass cisgender women in public restrooms, neither of which have anything to do with Rowling’s gender identity. 
Moreover, this “I have trans friends” mantra is ever so common — “I have Black friends, so that means I cannot be racist” is a classic line boasted by white people who get defensive in conversations surrounding race. The truth is, though, being acquainted with a marginalized community does not exempt one from oppressive behaviors. Plus, assuming that it does serves as the cornerstone of tokenization or the use of a member of an underrepresented group to project allyship. 
For instance, following the nomination of Judge Amy Coney Barrett, many Republicans have justified her as a candidate that Democrats cannot possibly scrutinize. I saw one tweet in particular: “Well, I guess labeling Amy Coney Barrett a racist and rapist is out.” Ironically, it captions a photo of her sister — not the Supreme Court nominee herself — with Barrett’s adopted children from Haiti. 
This view epitomizes tokenization — she may have Black children, but this does not negate her support for a racist president, and it does not offset her upholding policies that harm marginalized communities. For example, her record shows hostility against the Affordable Care Act and Title IX on college campuses. 
As prompted by Ibram X. Kendi, the author of “How to be an Antiracist,” “Some White colonizers ‘adopted’ Black children. They ‘civilized’ these ‘savage’ children in the ‘superior’ ways of White people, while using them as props in their lifelong pictures of denial, while cutting the biological parents of these children out of the picture of humanity.” He finishes his Twitter thread by positing, “And whether this is Barrett or not is not the point. It is a belief too many White people have: if they have or adopt a child of color, then they can’t be racist.” 
Kendi received criticism for the comments, but he perfectly explains the “I have Black kids” rhetoric. Assimilation of people from “shithole countries” is a Eurocentric, white supremacy ideal that suggests non-white people need to change themselves to be more civilized. Whatever her intentions were, Barrett can adopt Black kids and still perpetuate this racist ideology. 
Additionally, being a part of a marginalized community does not excuse one from being oppressive against that community. Barrett is an anti-feminist woman — she is affiliated with a conservative Christian group called People of Praise, where women covenant to submit to their husband’s will. She is anti-abortion and has ruled against Title IX policies that protect sexual assault victims, citing their “anti-male sex bias.” Just as Black police officers can participate in an oppressive institution that perpetuates violence against Black people, women can participate in a misogynistic system that oppresses other women. 
Nonetheless, this brings us back to Rowling — she may insist that she finds kinship with the trans community, yet her behavior instigates violence against trans people, who experience higher rates of harassment and violence compared to the general population. It is inherently ignorant and counterproductive to claim allyship based on your network instead of your actions, thoughts and behaviors. 
Ultimately, this faux belief completely undermines the complexity of biases by shielding them through superficial means. Tokenization does not remedy prejudices, whether it’s through trans friends or adopted Black children. Rowling and Barrett exemplify corrosive mindsets that we mustn’t follow and, more importantly, must continue to challenge.  
In the grand scheme of things, this has always been a war beyond TERFs. However, we are not fighting until the other side capitulates. We are fighting for progress.

Many students and faculty members tuned into a conversation with “The Office” actor Rainn Wilson on Oct. 5 expecting a lighthearted, comedic addition to their Monday afternoon. However, they were left with a gripping, awe-inspiring, discussion that challenged the ways students thought about spirituality, meaning and flourishment.
“I came here looking for laughs and jokes and found so much more instead,” said Franz Gonzalez, a sophomore majoring in real estate finance.
Wilson spoke as part of THRIVE, a series of speaking events focused on well-being hosted by USC Dean of Religious and Spiritual Life Varun Soni. THRIVE is a series under USC AMPLIFIED, an initiative of campus-wide speaking events launched in Fall 2020 that aims to host diverse public figures to engage students in meaningful conversations.
Wilson is most known for his quirky, distinctive portrayal of Dwight Schrute on the NBC sitcom “The Office” that has resonated with hundreds of millions around the world. Aside from his role as Dwight, Wilson has starred in countless films and published a New York Times best-selling book, “SoulPancake,” along with the platform SoulPancake that “explores life’s big questions” through social media and web mediums. 
Exploring some of these big questions over Zoom, Wilson pushed students to expand their minds and consider new perspectives regarding their outlooks on life. He dissected what it means to be happy, suggesting that instead of pursuing “happiness,” we should instead be in pursuit of “eudaimonia.” Eudaimonia is best described as a state of human flourishing or thriving.  
He explained how he dislikes the word “happiness” because of how intangible of a concept it is, instead giving an example of how eudaimonia is more tangible and practical.
“If I’m feeling down, I know that part of my human flourishing is to be creative,” Wilson said. “If I can just be creative, I flourish, and I feel a deeper contentment, purpose and meaning.” 
Soni then brought up one of Wilson’s favorite quotes by the French philosopher Pierre Teilhard de Chardin: “We are not human beings having a spiritual experience, but spiritual beings having a human experience.” 
Wilson emphasized how it doesn’t matter what faith one practices, and one can be non-religious or agnostic, yet still be a spiritual being. This quote reframes his perspective; Wilson’s philosophy is that we are on a journey that transcends mundane needs and desires such as money, work and material goods. 
“My mission is not to simply soothe the anxiety of my body and mind,” Wilson said. “That shifts my perspective so that I can go through my day remembering that there is a sacredness, a divinity, and a light in me that needs to be nurtured.”  
There are many different paths and ways to nurture the divine qualities in each of us including generosity, lovingness and compassion, Wilson said. He points out that many times people seek to fulfill external goals, without taking the time to reflect and find peace within themselves. 
Contemplating what it means that millions of people around the world choose to continuously rewatch “The Office” as a way to soothe their anxieties, Wilson encouraged people to seek different methods to quell anxiety rather than simply watching a TV show. He jokingly questioned if “The Office” should be considered “art,” which was met with a lot of passionate voices in the Zoom chat saying “The Office” is, in fact, a great piece of art. 
On the topic of art and suffering, Wilson expressed how art is created from the totality of the individual, which includes pain and suffering. He noted that a major part of life is suffering, yet people are always trying to escape it.
“I’m suffering, I pick up my phone. I’m suffering, I watch a show. I’m suffering, I eat a candy bar,” Wilson said. “As opposed to [realizing], ‘this is a valuable part of life and my suffering is trying to teach me something.’”   
Some students said Wilson’s words motivated them.
“This is really something I didn’t realize I needed,” said Charlie Feuerborn, a sophomore majoring in computer science and game design.
The event also connected students through the chat box, where they planned a USC Office Fan Club through GroupMe that included over 60 members. Overall, students gained some new perspectives and a new office-loving community. 
“This is a sublime conversation of enlightenment and spirituality,” said Romitta Hoff, a graduate student studying social work.

The New York Times’ report on President Donald Trump’s tax returns, which shows he paid no federal income taxes for 10 of 15 years between 2001 and 2015 and just $750 in 2016 and 2017, reveals many things about the president’s past and character. 
The returns show he is not as prolific a businessman as many are inclined to believe, as evidenced by the hundreds of millions of dollars of debt he has accumulated and the pattern of massive yearly losses he incurs from his golf and hotel properties. It should be noted that a major facet of his 2016 presidential campaign was his business experience and acumen.
The report also reveals unethical and potentially fraudulent tax maneuvers. These include labeling haircuts, fuel for private jets and rooms at Mar-a-Lago as “business expenses” to obtain tax credits. He even labeled his estate where his kids grew up in Westchester, N.Y. as an investment property to get further tax write-offs.
Trump’s character and reputation as a businessman will certainly be damaged by this report, but — more importantly — Trump’s character and reputation as a United States citizen is damaged in public discourse.
Virtually every American pays their fair share in taxes to the government as required by law. This is a critical function of our society. We all pitch in so we can have roads, parks, water, streetlights, schools, Social Security, national security and so many other services from our government.
By using personal expenses and business losses to pay $1,500 less federal income tax than the average middle-class household in the UnitedStates, Trump decided he did not have to support our federal government and instead could be a free rider off millions of tax-paying citizens. He chose himself and his personal wealth over giving the country his fair share. This is unethical for a private citizen to do, but for a president to do this completely subverts and contradicts the purpose of the office: to serve the American people.
Paying taxes is part of one’s civic duty and part of being a patriot. Regardless of any other critique of the president, a man who has a history of avoiding contribution to the nation’s shared resources is not a viable leader by any stretch of the imagination.  
Someone who fails to contribute their share to the government cannot seriously and legitimately put forth policies using taxpayers’ money. Some of his moves include increasing the military budget and spending $11 billion on a border wall that many experts deem unnecessary. Furthermore, a schoolteacher or nurse or social worker who may rely on public health insurance or public transportation to get to her job cannot trust a self-proclaimed billionaire with her tax money when she pays more to the federal government than him.
Trump has never had personal conviction for the average American. He clearly never did while avoiding taxes as a private citizen and has shown time and time time again throughout his presidency that he still does not. If not even the scrutiny and ethical pressure of the presidency can bring Trump to (at the very least) prioritize community values by paying his taxes, one can only imagine what he does behind closed doors.

As soon as I finished watching “Euphoria,” I grabbed my wallet and keys and raced down to the closest drugstore. (Yes, I realize I’m late to the whole “Euphoria” thing. Deal with it.) At the store, I scanned the beauty aisle shelves for anything glittery or bright, filling my basket with a rainbow of powders and creams. After spending much more money than I wish to admit, I returned home and dumped the colorful mess on my bed. Feeling a sudden deep hunger, I went to the kitchen to make a grilled cheese. 
OK. Pause. Rewind. Why was I getting makeup after watching an HBO teen drama? If you’ve been living under a rock like me and haven’t seen “Euphoria,” it is a show about the painful and beautiful experience of adolescence, narrated by our protagonist Rue (played beautifully by Zendaya), who struggles with substance abuse. I won’t say anything more to avoid spoilers for those who haven’t seen it, but one of the most remarkable things about “Euphoria” is its style. Every episode is full of stunning shots and beautiful images. One of the iconic parts of “Euphoria” is its stylized makeup by artist Doniella Davy (seriously, if you don’t want to watch the show, at least look up the makeup art, it is stunning). OK. Unpause. 
After eating my grilled cheese (it was delicious, thanks for asking) and returning to my senses, I re-entered my bedroom and recoiled at the sight of my impulsive purchases. Suddenly, the purple eyeliner and green glitter looked more intimidating than inspiring, and I began to regret my decision. There was no way I could pull off a Euphoria-style makeup look, I told myself. But something inside of me — maybe the creative juices that dried up once theaters closed for the pandemic — told me that I had to try it. I had to experiment. Maybe makeup art was my calling. Maybe it would make me feel more confident. Maybe I would love it. Maybe it’s Maybelline’s marketing department trying to sell me things I don’t need. Either way, I wanted to find out. 
I decided to start with a small challenge. For three days, I would wear Euphoria-style makeup and document the way it made me feel. 
Day One: 
I woke up feeling groggy and exhausted. I wanted to roll out of bed, dab on some mascara and pull up my hoodie for my 8 a.m. class. But I don’t back down from a challenge. So I decided to start with something easy. I ripped the protective covering off my brand new silver eyeliner and slid the creamy pencil over my eyes. It was beautiful, but it was hardly noticeable. The perfect introduction to my little makeup experiment. 
All day, no one (except for an extremely detail-oriented Starbucks barista who said I looked “cooler than usual”) noticed my silver-streaked eyelids. But it didn’t matter. Knowing that I was wearing the eyeliner gave me a subtle but constant boost of confidence throughout the day. It reminded me of how I used to feel as a kid every year on the first day of school when I finally got to wear the new shoes my parents got me for the school year. 
Day Two: 
After a successful first day of my “Euphoria” makeup experiment, I was excited to continue. On Day Two, I had plans to go out to dinner with my family, which was occasion enough for me to go all out. I pulled out the bright pink shadows, the glitter, the gloss. Then, I not-so-methodically applied the products to my face, smearing sparkly pinks and purples on my skin. I stepped back and looked at my reflection. I felt like I was looking at a completely different person. 
Channeling my inner Jules (one of the characters on “Euphoria”), I grabbed a pair of combat boots and headed out. Day Two was not at all like Day One. Everyone noticed my makeup. Some people complimented me, others gave me confused glares. As someone who is used to blending into the crowd, I felt very exposed. I didn’t like the feeling of being looked at and assessed, leaving myself open to compliments and criticisms alike. 
Day Three: 
On the final day of my makeup challenge, I decided to conquer the most intimidating product I had bought: rhinestones. Deciding to leave the rest of my makeup simple, I unpacked the tiny diamonds and carefully glued them around my eyes. I looked up at my reflection. I loved them. They were noticeable, but not in-your-face. They were subtle and pretty. I felt confident but not exposed.
Looking back on my makeup adventure, I’m proud of myself for having stepped out of my comfort zone and tried something new. I don’t really see myself wearing rhinestones or purple eyeliner again any time soon, but there was something extremely satisfying about turning my impulse into a challenge and allowing myself to explore a new outlet for self expression. So the next time you’re feeling a little bored or a little down or a little less than your beautiful self, sprinkle some glitter on your face.

A rising star in the music industry, Sally Boy brings in a fresh wave of sound to listeners everywhere, starting with his newest pop singles.
Erez Potok-Holmes, stage name Sally Boy, is a senior majoring in popular music and minoring in philosophy. Hailing from Philadelphia, Potok-Holmes brings a sincere style and voice to the lo-fi pop genre and employs skillful storytelling techniques in each of his songs, offering his genuine perspective of life to listeners.
Potok-Holmes’ self-titled debut single “Sally Boy” was released June 30 and was also the source of inspiration behind his artist name. With nostalgic lyrics and vocals, the song focuses on childhood, growing up and self-identity. 
The song reads like a stream of consciousness, with lyrics “I lost my way, ‘cause I’m falling to pieces / I’ve lost my way, how my body regrets” that show the artist’s pensive and rather somber thoughts on the series of changes he experienced after going off to college and living by himself.
Embedded with nostalgia, “Sally Boy” immediately appeals to listeners and has currently yielded more than 106,000 streams on Spotify.
While the popularity of his singles, three total to date, are ever growing, Potok-Holmes’ accomplishments took dedication and practice. His interest in music started at a young age and gradually became what he knew he wanted to pursue as a career. 
“I tend to believe that I sort of was never not interested in music. I mean, I started playing piano when I was two,” Potok-Holmes said. 
He then added that there has always been something that piqued his music interest. Both of his parents can play the piano, and their love for music encouraged Potok-Holmes to participate in all kinds of music-related activities throughout his childhood and adolescence. From elementary to high school, Potok-Holmes started from musical theatre and writing to performing his own music. Now in college, he is on tour and releasing music in different capacities.
At USC, Potok-Holmes is able to receive a variety of resources that have propelled his music career thus far. 
“I definitely found a lot of new music [by taking] different classes at USC,” Potok-Holmes said. “I [also] think USC really helped me meet the people that furthered my career. The best thing that USC has done for me was create my network. Without USC, I wouldn’t have everyone that I currently work with.”
For him, Paul McCartney, John Lennon and Kanye West are among some of the most inspiring artists because they create their own sound while still finding a way to appeal to the masses. 
“I like artists who do whatever they want,” Potok-Holmes said. “They [have] their own sound. They create their own sound, but they find a way to still make an appeal to large masses of people.”
When it comes to songwriting, Potok-Holmes draws inspiration from reading novels, watching films and his personal life experiences. The latter is how Potok-Holmes came up with his debut single “Sally Boy,” as the song revolves around his personal growth over the past three years and his realization that he is no longer a kid.
“I still think you can still maintain certain pieces of childhood throughout your life, but the realities [now are different from the ones] I had as a child,” Potok-Holmes said. “I’ve mentally gone through that transition, so [it] just came out naturally with my music that I would speak about it, I’ll touch on how I would convey how I feel about the whole experience.”
Sean Lewow, a senior majoring in music industry, is one of Potok-Holmes’ co-managers. He talks about his impression of Sally Boy’s talent and belief in him as an artist. 
“We really feel like Erez is an unbelievably skilled musician director, who has a vision for his work and has things to say,”  Lewow said. “We want to make sure that, you know, he’s set up in a way to where it’s sustainable for him to continue doing this for a long time.”
Up until now, Potok-Holmes has released three songs: “Sally Boy,” “Stormy” and “Sippy Cup.” While the first two songs are more acoustic and have a reminiscing tone, “Sippy Cup” shows the versatility of his music style with playful and upbeat elements, accompanied by catchy lyrics.
“So I think I wanted to develop my first two songs to be like my future thing,” Potok-Holmes said. “I like two types of music: sad music and hype music. I like to go to two extremes. So I guess the first two songs versus ‘Sippy Cup’ are like the two different sides of me. ‘Sally Boy’ is definitely a very acoustic-centric song. ‘Stormy’ is more about showing the breadth of my skills. ‘Sippy Cup’ is just like pop music with exciting stuff.”
Potok-Holmes’ producer, Cole Mitchell, is a senior majoring in popular music. He said “Sally Boy” is one of his favorite productions.
“I think ‘Sally Boy’ will always have a place in my heart,” Mitchell said. “And it’s the first track we worked on together. And it started basically just a focus on him on guitar. The evolution of the song, it took, you know, a year and a half, almost two years to record. There’s just something very endearing about it.”
The styles of the music videos for the three singles are also good exhibitions of Potok-Holmes’ ideas through visual storytelling. 
As the line producer for “Stormy” and one of the actors in the “Sippy Cup” music video, co-manager John Van Liere, who is also a USC senior majoring in music industry, talked about the production process of Potok-Holmes’ two latest singles. He said the friendship between him and the artist, the way they talk together and joke around, is a sort of trademark which contributed to the fruition of the “Sippy Cup” music video.
“[The video] is really weird and pretty strange in the way that it goes from thing to thing,” Van Liere said. “I think ‘Stormy’ is more of a serious side of Erez’s. That song is a little bit more on the melancholy side. The vibe is different, so we want more of a cinematic and beautiful look to it. I think that our videos are just us trying to show the world, our world.”
Potok-Holmes also shared some of his suggestions for USC students who also plan to work in the music industry in the future. 
“I think the best way to say is that first of all, find your people because no matter what, no one’s gonna do this alone,” Potok-Holmes said. 
He then went on to explain the details.
“Secondly, be intentional with your process,” Potok-Holmes said. “I’m seeing a lot of people who just let their heart guide their writing, and I did the same thing initially. But I think it’s also wise to go back and look at what you’re saying and be intentional with everything you’re trying to do in production, from vocal tambor to what drum group you [use], don’t half-ass your art, because people know when you are not being real.”
Potok-Holmes had one last piece of advice for his listeners.
“Everybody should go register to vote, and check out my new music at the same time,” Potok-Holmes said. “Because Sally Boy’s music sounds really good when everyone registers to vote.”
Potok-Holmes’ seven-song EP project will be released on Oct. 28. According to Mitchell, the EP will be a dynamic production for listeners.

“You’re athletic,” “You’re strong,” “You’re fast,” “Just run — you’re lucky.”
For any Black female soccer player, these words were the only descriptors ever afforded by coaches and peers during their playing careers. It is not until years down the road that you realize these were not compliments but racially charged microaggressions used to minimize your success and inhibit your potential. 
They were always subtly hinting at the idea that our success is owed to the phenotypical stereotypes of our race rather than because of hours of practice and effort. Even when you are successful, coaches offer praise by comparing you to the few well-known Black faces in women’s soccer. To me, scoring does not make me Sydney Leroux or Crystal Dunn — it makes me a successful player all on my own. 
I can still think back to when I was about 10 years old, wondering why I was never called talented. My white teammates were often showered with this accolade. They heard things like “you’re gifted,” “you work so hard” and “you’re such a smart player.” But I never did. 
The praise I always heard seemed to echo the stereotype of Black people being “specimens” naturally born to run fast or jump high. While I spent the same amount of time in practice, practiced the same drills and worked on the same skills as my white teammates, at the end of the day, my merit was chalked up to natural ability and never talent or hard work. Those coaches selectively picking and choosing what praise was given to whom created a huge divide that I was not even aware of until many years into my soccer career. It became an Us versus Them mentality. 
The reality was that we encompassed about one or two players and They were the remaining 16 or 17 team members. You do the same drills and excel, but for some reason everyone seems surprised when you perfect them. Your coaches and teammates are thinking: Wow, it must have been luck. 
There have been times when myself and other Black players began to notice that we were being given fewer reps. I had one particular club coach who would say I “didn’t need to work on it anymore” and I could “take a break” while the rest of my teammates could continue practicing their skill work. I firmly believe every rep counts — so what makes my time worth less than my white counterparts? 
Being the only Black player on my team for the majority of my life, I just accepted the fact that maybe it is just me. I started to internalize these racially motivated microaggressions no matter how hard I tried to tell myself they weren’t true. However, soon I realized it was happening to every Black girl on every team. The subtle smile before and after games when seeing another Black player represented a noted sense of solidarity. I always felt it, but I didn’t really know what it meant at the time. It was this year that made it clear. 
With the growing Black Lives Matter movement and the platform athletics is giving modern day athletes, several Black soccer players have stepped up to be a voice. Recently, in the National Women’s Soccer League, Black players formed a coalition to demand better from each individual team and their league overall. More importantly, it became a safe space for the few Black players in the league while offering support to younger generations. 
Harvard graduate and current member of Sky Blue FC Margaret Purce has focused her activism on the inequality in the technical development of young Black girls. Technical skills include passing, dribbling through cones and reading the game from a tactical standpoint. And as I noted earlier, coaches will often take technical reps away from Black players to give white players more or even insist that the Black players “don’t need them” because of their stereotypical beliefs about Black athletes. Not only does this limit future success, but it leaves players fighting a mental battle created by coaches over the years. 
It was something I had to overcome along with my Black teammates here at USC. It is like playing a never-ending game of catch up. At 15, I was working on technical skills I should have been taught at the age of 12 because I was always told to “just run by them.” We all came from different parts of the country, different teams and different coaches, yet our stories were all too similar. 
I soon came to realize there was a unique reason we all ended up at the school we did. Not only is USC one of the best soccer programs in the country, but our head coach, Keidane McAlpine, is one of the most decorated Black coaches in the game. He was one of the first coaches to bring up more than just my athleticism by noting specific parts of my game that were technical and not genetic. 
For the first time in my 17-year soccer career, I feel as if being a Black player is not a disadvantage. His coaching philosophy is one that focuses on all the small details: using the right foot to pass, proper defensive footwork, communication with teammates, etc. I am grateful to be seen as more than just an athletic Black girl. For the first time in a long time, I am a soccer player. I hope that one day, all Black female soccer players will be taken seriously and called talented as well as hard-working.
