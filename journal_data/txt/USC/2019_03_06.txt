At the Sociologists for Women in Society’s Conference two years ago, three Ph.D. students were so inspired by the conference’s theme of intersectionality that they decided to write a children’s book about the concept. On July 16, their idea will come to life when “IntersectionAllies: We Make Room for All” is released nationally through feminist publisher Dottir Press. 
Carolyn Choi, LaToya Council and Chelsea Johnson, three USC students studying sociology, wrote the book to explore intersectionality. The book examines the overlap in race, gender and sexuality, and how it impacts different social structures.
“IntersectionAllies” breaks down intersectionality for young, everyday audiences to help them understand their own and others’ identities better.
“The book is about empathy,” Johnson said. “It’s about inspiring empathy and seeing similarities across difference and ways to help your friends using the skills that you have that they might not, or the privileges you have that they may not have access to.” 
The book tells the stories of eight girls and one gender nonconforming child as each navigates the social challenges. 
“What we do is we demonstrate how children’s safety is concerned by their intersectional identities, such as their gender, their class, their ability, their race, their religion, culture, citizenship and more,” Council said. “For example, we have Nia, who does Black Lives Matter protests, helping out her friend … Dakota, who’s engaged with … having access to clean water with the Dakota Access Pipeline.” 
In the book, Johnson also highlighted a young Korean girl who acts as a language broker for her immigrant mother. 
“The character that I’m most proud of is Heejung’s character,” Johnson said. “I think it’s just such a beautiful character because it shows the power that kids have that you might not think to celebrate, but that are really transformative and important for people’s families.”
The authors felt that given the current divisive political climate, it was important to get their message of inclusion out to children.  According to statistics released by the FBI in 2018, reports of hate crime incidents have risen in the U.S. over the past three years. 
Choi said one of their goals in writing the book was to teach children to understand and respect other peoples’ identities as well as the challenges they may face as a result. 
“In these trying political times, there’s increased bullying at school because of identity-based issues and tensions, so what spoke to us, is [the book] introduces very early issues of intersecting or different identities to children,” Choi said. 
Choi, Council and Johnson all use intersectionality in their dissertations, and the book is rooted in academic research. Johnson said the characters are all based on research by USC sociologists. However, the book attempts to expand the applications of intersectionality outside of the academic world. 
“We were talking about how a lot of scholars are engaging in ways of how to do intersectionality on this empirical, research-based perspective, but we don’t talk much about how to put intersectionality into practice,” Council said. “How do we do intersectional, social justice, public work? And so, we said, ‘What about a children’s book?’” 
At the SWS annual conference in February 2017, the authors said they wanted to find a way to explain intersectionality in simpler terms, so that any person, regardless of age or education, could understand it. 
“We thought that the perfect solution to do that was a children’s book because it forces you to simplify your language, and it’s a way to educate entire households,” Johnson said. 
Johnson said the book was written for children to not only understand intersectionality and create change but also to help parents and teachers educate children about social issues. 
“Parents and educators who have the desire to make the world better but don’t have the tools to do so … may be afraid to ask because they think it’s something they should know,” Johnson said. 
She also said that academics such as her and her co-authors will see their research and work presented in a new way that could appeal to and inform larger audiences. 
Johnson said the trio wrote the manuscript together during dinners over the course of three to four months and enjoyed the opportunity to collaborate.
“We would get together, we would block out a couple of hours of time to talk over a meal and just discuss,” Johnson said. “A lot of the times, for Ph.D. students, you’re doing work by yourself in a room. It’s so individual, and it can be really lonely. I think we all really came alive in that process.” 
They emailed artist Ashley Seil Smith after seeing her illustrations in one of Lena Dunham’s “Lenny” Letters. Smith agreed to illustrate “IntersectionAllies,” and worked with the trio to produce a book dummy to send to publishers focused on progressive works. They shipped out their dummy, then started the waiting game. In the end, a USC connection turned their dream into a reality.
Johnson was working on USC’s Beyond the Ph.D. Conference as an intern for the Career Center when one of the speakers connected her with Jennifer Baumgardner, editor-in-chief of Women’s Review of Books. Baumgardner had just started her own feminist publishing house, Dottir Press, and agreed to pick-up “IntersectionAllies.” 
“After we settled on Dottir, which we chose because they really loved the scholarly gist of the book, things moved a lot faster,” Johnson said. “From beginning to end, it took about two years.”
“IntersectionAllies” will feature a forward written by critical race theory scholar Kimberlé Williams Crenshaw, who coined the term intersectionality. Political science and gender studies professor Ange-Marie Hancock Alfaro wrote a letter to parents that will also be printed in “IntersectionAllies.”
Council said Hancock Alfaro’s class in feminist theory was the first course in her doctoral studies that delved into intersectionality and how to apply intersectional research. 
In the future, the authors plan to publish more children’s books as part of a series rooted in intersectionality, as well as produce tools and curriculum for classrooms.
“This is supposed to be a series,” Choi said. “These books will be also based on the concept of intersectionality and talking about different types of family forms to celebrate and honor them, as well as different types of bodies across skin color and body shapes.”

In my journalism classes at the Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism, I’m often one of few men in the classroom. However, the same isn’t true in American newsrooms. According to the 2018 American Society of News Editors Newspaper Diversity Survey, which analyzed the gender breakdown of 292 newsrooms across America, 59 percent of workers in newsrooms are male.
Even worse, women are also underpaid in newsrooms. According to the News Guild of New York, men working for The New York Times’ newsroom made $9,516 more than their female peers on average as of April 2016. Similarly, and perhaps more egregiously, male reporters at the Los Angeles Times made $14,334 more than women in the same role on average, according to an April 2018 L.A. Times Guild study. 
This, obviously, isn’t due to a lack of interest or excellence among women pursuing journalism. Plenty of women are studying journalism in college — Annenberg’s 2018 class profile of its M.S. in journalism students said that 82 percent of its students were women. 
So in honor of International Women’s Day this week, I’m highlighting a few female journalists who have made significant impact in the journalism industry throughout American history.
Ida Tarbell 
Coming to prominence in the early 1900s, Ida Tarbell was one of the founding reporters who developed muckraker journalism — the precursor to modern investigative journalism. Tarbell is perhaps best known for her exposé of the Standard Oil Company, a monopoly owned by John Rockefeller, according to Smithsonian Magazine. 
Tarbell became interested in the story because her father’s small oil company was run out of business by Rockefeller. By getting close to sources within Standard Oil and spending two years diligently reporting the story, Tarbell was able to obtain internal documents that revealed the company colluded with railroad companies to put other oil providers out of business. 
Tarbell’s exposé spurred government action against the Standard Oil Company. In 1911, a Supreme Court decision found the company in violation of the Sherman Anti-Trust Act, Smithsonian Magazine said. 
Not only did Tarbell’s journalism cause meaningful changes for small oil producers and consumers, but it also spurred decades of investigative journalism that drove political reform throughout the early 20th century and directly influenced modern watchdog journalism that helps keep government in check. 
Katharine Graham 
Played by Meryl Streep in the 2017 Steven Spielberg film “The Post,” Katharine Graham is known for her tenure as The Washington Post’s publisher in the ’60s and ’70s. As the only female publisher in the industry at the time, Graham led the newspaper through major historical events despite regularly combating sexism in the field — her own father made her husband The Post’s publisher before he died because he didn’t think a woman was fit for the position, and Graham only took over when her husband died, Smithsonian Magazine said. 
“The Post” details how Graham navigated the difficult decision to publish the Pentagon Papers, a trove of documents related to the U.S. government’s handling of the Vietnam War. While lawyers urged her not to publish the papers in fear of government retaliation in court, Graham decided to print them, exposing major concerns about U.S. involvement in Vietnam. The Pentagon Papers also led to a landmark Supreme Court decision that barred the government from blocking newspapers’ publication of any story or document in most circumstances, The New York Times said. 
But Graham is responsible for much more beyond the story of “The Post.” Her leadership transformed the newspaper into the prominent news source it is today. While she isn’t mentioned in the film “All the President’s Men,” which detailed The Post’s historic investigation into the Watergate scandal, she was the publisher while the reporting was ongoing. The major decisions she made during the investigation allowed reporters Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein the resources and time they needed to report the story when other papers might’ve dismissed it at first because of the reporters’ initial lack of adequate sourcing, Graham’s book, “Personal History,” said. 
Christiane Amanpour
Through her war reporting and commanding television presence, Christiane Amanpour helped define CNN’s brand as it grew into a major television news network. Now, she hosts her own global affairs show for CNN International: “Amanpour.” 
Amanpour displayed the news judgement and careful reporting necessary for war correspondents early in her career. She brought stories of conflict from around the world that no other news organization was covering, and her authoritative yet compassionate approach to reporting made her appealing to American viewers. She would take seemingly irrelevant stories, like conflict in Bosnia, and illustrate their importance to Americans — she strongly believed that American intervention in foreign affairs was vital, The New York Times said. 
As she established herself at CNN, she became the network’s first real television personality — unlike most news reporters, American viewers began to see her as part of the story rather than merely telling it. This quickly thrust her into stardom among television networks. Major news networks offered her seven-figure contracts to leave CNN, but she ultimately chose to stay on at the network that helped her grow because she wanted to reach an international audience, The New York Times said.

International Women’s Day is dedicated to the celebration of womanhood, female empowerment and gender equality. However, it is also a day to raise awareness surrounding the continued inequalities women still face — many of which are apparent on campus. While women no longer represent the gender minority of students at USC, they still make up less than half of USC faculty, according to the USC Office of Institutional Research. Though the University claims to have a diverse campus, it is clear more work must be done to increase female representation among University faculty. 
A lack of female representation in faculty and leadership can be detrimental for students. Failing to see women in leadership, teaching and research positions reinforces sexist stereotypes in higher education — a field that is already perceived as both majority male and intended for males to dominate. This feeds into insecurities many female students interested in pursuing careers in higher education face because it perpetuates perceptions that it is much harder for women to achieve tenure and reach equality in academia. For male students, a lack of female representation can also purvey the inaccurate notion that women should not be viewed as their equals in the field. 
The Viterbi School of Engineering already has fewer female students than males, according to the school’s self-reported numbers, and the gender inequalities in faculty only contribute to harmful stereotypes about STEM fields. The tokenization of women and domination of males in STEM are exacerbated by the minimal representation of female students and faculty. Women are viewed as particularly gifted to have made their way into male-dominated classrooms, rather than inherently capable of doing so. Meanwhile, men continue to monopolize the field. 
The lack of female faculty also decreases the quality of relationships between students and professors. While the number  of female students indicate an increased amount of gender equality, a lack of female professors limits the professors’ relatability to their students. Young women lacking female professors may feel less inclined to view their professors as mentors and role models. Conversely, male students are given the advantage of having a broader range of mentors and role models to choose from.
At USC, tenure-track faculty is 42.4 percent female. Only 26.2 percent of tenured faculty is female. Male faculty also make up the majority within all fields of study on campus, according to the USC Office of Institutional Research. Female representation in faculty is particularly low in the field of science and engineering, comprising 32.9 percent of staff on tenure-track, and only 15.1 percent of tenured faculty. 
USC also falls behind in gender diversity and equality with regard to leadership on campus. Among the 21 academic deans, only eight are female. Within the pool of 29 USC Distinguished Professors, only six are female. Interim President Wanda Austin was the University’s first-ever female president, and it is important for students to see more women like her represented in positions of power. 
USC touts its diversity standards, reaching new levels of diversity with every admitted class, according to USC News. However, the blatant lack of tenured and tenure-track female professors in addition to female leaders, contradicts this statement entirely. As a university seeking to attain a position of influence in the global sphere, it is essential for USC to maintain integrity in its diversity efforts. USC must model gender equality in students’ academic experiences, across all facets of the community. A failure to do so only sends a message of insincerity and ultimately, gender discrimination.

Famed civil rights attorney and USC alumnus Dale Minami joined nearly 100 students for a discussion about the history of Japanese American internment and civil rights Tuesday. 
Minami, who notably overturned the U.S. Supreme Court decision in Korematsu v. United States, which justified the internment of approximately 110,000 Japanese Americans, was invited by professor Alison Dundes Renteln to speak in her “Human Rights” course.
“He has been one of the great legal minds in our time,” Dundes said as she introduced him. “[He is] certainly a hero of mine. I’ve admired him for many years.”
Minami attended UC Berkeley’s School of Law, which was previously named the Boalt School of Law after John Boalt, now known for being an anti-Chinese racist. Dundes Renteln said Minami played a role in changing the school’s name after backlash from students. She drew a parallel to the controversy surrounding the Von KleinSmid Center on USC’s campus, which was named after former University president and eugenicist Rufus Von KleinSmid. 
Minami noted the importance of Japanese American rights and Japanese Remembrance Day, which commemorates the beginning of Japanese internment in 1942.  
“We want to never forget what happened to Japanese Americans not just because of the tragic injustices they suffered, but for all of America to understand the fragility of our civil rights,” Minami said. 
Minami also summarized the history of Japanese internment during World War II. He said Pearl Harbor, the 1941 Japanese attack on American forces in Hawaii, started the U.S.’s conflict with Japan. On Feb. 19 that year President Franklin D. Roosevelt issued an executive order that allowed military leaders to evacuate anyone they deemed a national threat. 
This allowed John DeWitt, an anti-Japanese general in the Army, to order his soldiers to relocate and imprison Japanese people. Minami said DeWitt believed all Japanese people were enemies to the United States, even if they were citizens.
“He applied that to Japanese Americans and not just citizens of Japan,” Minami said. “And that began years of infamy, and that was the banishment and exile of 120,000 Americans of Japanese ancestry, some with as little as 48 hours notice.”
Minami also recounted the experiences of his own family in the aftermath of the executive order. He said his family was only able to take two suitcases with them. His younger brother was only 1 year old when his family was forced to relocate.
“They were essentially imprisoned … They had no due process rights,” Minami said. “They didn’t have the right to attorneys; they had no right to the notice of charges, no right to a trial enshrined in the Fifth Amendment … These are due process rights, they’re almost inviolable.”
Minami discussed three landmark cases he worked to overturn, including Korematsu and Yasui v. United States and Hirabayashi v. United States, which both reinforced the implementation of curfews for people in internment camps during wartime. 
Since the cases have been overturned, Minami said there have been new forms of injustice and calls for deportation and internment, including President Donald Trump’s executive order banning people from seven predominantly Muslim countries from entering the U.S. He said Trump used Japanese internment as a precedent for these bans.
“This is a massive racial and religious profiling that he is doing, but Donald Trump is demanding complete deference to his order,” Minami said. “That’s exactly what the president did during Korematsu.”
He said Trump’s reasoning behind the proposed wall on the U.S.-Mexican border is similar to the reasoning behind Japanese internment and exclusion because it is based in prejudice rather than facts about illegal immigration. 
“The wall that is declared a national emergency, [for] national security, you must support this wall because we have a national emergency,” Minami said.
Thomas Kim, a junior majoring in international relations asked about Minami’s opinion on the current case of Asian Americans challenging affirmative action at Harvard University.
“I really dislike what they’re doing because they’re being used: It’s not Asian Americans who simply do it,” Minami said. “This is being driven by an anti-affirmative action white person.” 
Bita Minaravushi, a doctoral student in the population health and place program, said she enjoyed hearing the connections Minami made between the Trump v. Hawaii case and past cases that affirmed Japanese internment practices. 
“I had never made those relations myself, so it’s really great,” Minaravushi said. “They’re great warnings, they’re great lessons from history, and I can continue learning from them.”

Fifteen additional former and current USC students have joined a lawsuit against former campus men’s sexual health doctor Dennis Kelly and the University. A total of 21 plaintiffs, most of whom identify as gay or bisexual, have now come forward, alleging that Kelly sexually harassed them during appointments at the Engemann Student Health Center, according to the complaint. 
Kellogg & Van Aken LLP, the firm representing the victims, filed the original suit on Feb. 11. The lawsuit accuses Kelly of sexual battery, sexual abuse and discrimination in an educational setting and also alleges that USC was responsible for negligent hiring and retention. 
“After we filed the initial complaint against Dr. Kelly and USC, we really got an amazing response from young men, both current and former students of USC, coming forward to [share] their experiences … on campus,” Kellogg said. “Many of them wanted to be involved in the lawsuit, which is why we filed an amendment adding 15 additional men, and we anticipate filing another complaint filing even more since the response has been overwhelming.” 
Kelly was the only men’s sexual health doctor at Engemann for nearly 20 years. He resigned in August 2018, according to his resignation email, which was obtained by the Daily Trojan. 
Kellogg said most of the 21 plaintiffs experienced similar “unnecessary” genital or rectal examinations during appointments with Kelly.
“Their stories are similar, but of course each one individually has their own circumstances, but for the most part … they all experienced inappropriate questioning and unnecessary rectal examinations,” Kellogg said. 
During some of the examinations, Kelly allegedly used his fingers and medical devices to penetrate the anuses of his patients without reason. The suit states that Kelly’s examinations were a way for him to “satisfy his own prurient sexual desires and/or to shame, humiliate and embarrass Plaintiffs as a result of their sexual orientation and sexual practices.”
Kellogg said she is waiting for the University to respond to the allegations. 
“There has pretty much been a wall of silence from the University, and they have not acknowledged what these men have been through,” Kellogg said. “They haven’t responded about what they are doing that now a second doctor, in the same time period as Dr. Tyndall and under the same administration has had the same problems.” 
In a statement to the Daily Trojan, the University wrote they are aware of the ongoing suit and are concerned by the allegations. 
“The University’s investigation is ongoing,” the statement read. “We’re working across the University to understand the facts. We care deeply about our entire Trojan family, including our LGBTQ+ community and take this matter very seriously.” 
The addition of 15 plaintiffs comes nearly two weeks after nearly 50 students, faculty and alumni protested outside Engemann over the original allegations against Kelly. 
“We were thrilled to see that protest because it’s going to start with the students making changes,” Kellogg said. “It’s unfortunate because the University should be driving the change, but they’re not. They aren’t really telling students about what’s going on …. The fact that the students are demanding change and demanding action is really inspiring.”

Students discussed the current political and economic crisis in Venezuela, climate change and homelessness, among other topics at a political debate Tuesday hosted by Unruh Associates and the Political Student Assembly at Ground Zero Performance Café.  
Nearly 20 students attended the debate, which featured USC GOP, Trojan Advocates for Political Progress, USC College Democrats and Trojans for Liberty. 
Political Student Assembly Director Briana Miles and Unruh Associates Vice President José Guillermo Gutiérrez moderated the debate after organizers scrambled to find a new debate moderator. Symone Sanders, a Center for Political Future fellow and former national press secretary for 2016 presidential candidate Bernie Sanders, canceled at the last minute. 
Representatives from each group presented on the topics, beginning with a discussion about the United States’ involvement in the current political crisis in Venezuela. They spoke briefly about their doubt over the United States’ intervention techniques in other countries. All agreed that non-intervention was the ideal solution. 
“I definitely thought this was going to be a lot more contentious,” said Guillermo Gutiérrez, a junior majoring in political science. 
Audience members were allowed to pose their own questions to debaters. When asked how citizens can influence lawmakers to avoid intervention in Venezuela, USC GOP expressed disinterest in social action, while the other student groups voiced encouragement for social actions like protests. 
“I [do not] think it’s a big enough partisan issue to gain support to actually do anything to persuade lawmakers,” said USC GOP representative John Scavo, a sophomore majoring in political economy. “They’re going to do what they want.” 
TAPP, College Democrats and Trojans for Liberty switched out their debaters for the second topic of the night: climate change. Representatives addressed whether implementing the carbon tax would prove beneficial for climate change, which split the debaters into two groups. TAPP and College Dems supported the tax. 
“By 2050, we can reduce up to 80 percent of the net greenhouse gases we emit with the carbon tax that was just recently proposed by a bipartisan group of members of Congress and supported largely by Democrats,” said College Dems representative Andrew Binder, a freshman majoring in philosophy, politics and law.
The debate ended with a discussion on homelessness in the country. Student representatives examined the government’s responsibility to address the homelessness crisis. 
“Preventative measures, I think, is the best way the state can provide help [to homelessness],” Scavo said. “Mental health facilities, transportation, that sort of thing, is really important … I don’t know how effective providing affordable housing is when helping homeless populations because it’s not a supply issue, it’s a demand issue.” 
While the representatives expressed contention over finer points of homelessness like zoning restrictions, they agreed homelessness is a complex issue. No one presented a singular solution to address the crisis but instead discussed contributing factors like addiction and mental health issues. 
“I feel like people had different varying degrees of [political] expertise, and sometimes, certain political groups were clearly more educated on certain topics than others,” said Josh Masters, a senior majoring in animation and digital arts. “And to me, it wasn’t always a fair debate … I would want someone who disagrees with me to be well-prepared.” 
Students also commented on Sanders’ last-minute cancellation.
“I thought maybe the moderators could’ve been, you know, a little more prepared, but it sounded like they had been subbed in last minute by somebody who canceled, so I can’t blame them too much for that,” said Reed Barnes, a junior majoring in computer science.

The Undergraduate Student Government unanimously passed a resolution Tuesday urging University leaders and administrators to reevaluate USC’s ties to  Terranea Resort, which was dismissed as a party to a sexual harassment suit last May. 
USC Sports Properties, a division of FOX Sports Media Group and Home Team Sports, is listed as an official partner of Terranea Resort. The resort has been USC Athletics’ official hotel since 2012. Keck School of Medicine also hosts conferences and events there. 
The resolution requests that USC revoke sponsorships, conferences and hotel bookings from the resort in light of allegations of sexual harassment and misconduct from eight women during their employment at the hotel.
USG drafted the resolution following the Daily Trojan’s coverage of USC’s connection to Terranea Resort.
“When you fund an institution whose practices you don’t agree with, you are essentially complicit in those same practices, even if you are not an actor yourself,” Sen. Michaela Murphy said. “It would be really incredible if this resolution helped pave a way for the University to really reevaluate the power it has.” 
The resolution was supported by the Student Assembly for Gender Empowerment and co-authored by Murphy, Director of External Affairs Alec Vandenberg and the Student Coalition Against Labor Exploitation.
“We’re very concerned about how our University [affiliates], how we’re financially supporting an institution that we have a lot of troubling evidence of alleged wrongdoing,” Vandenberg said. “Especially in light of scandals with Engemann, USC has not been known to be proactive in dealing with issues of sexual harassment.” 
In a statement to the Daily Trojan, Terranea Resort President Terri Haack disputed some of the information presented in the resolution.
“Terranea has carefully examined the alleged complaints of harassment against the resort, and not a single one could be corroborated,” Haack wrote. “It is important to note that none of these complaints came to the surface during our first eight years of operation.” 
UNITE HERE Local 11, a union representing over 30,000 workers in Southern California, launched the #MeTooTerranea boycott against the hotel and its partner organizations, including USC. Haack alleges that UNITE HERE Local 11 is pressuring employees to unionize. 
“[The allegations] only emerged after labor union Unite Here Local 11 launched a smear campaign designed to force Terranea to agree to a flawed path to unionization in which our employees would be denied their federally protected right to a secret-ballot vote,” Haack wrote.
Haack said she has enforced a no-tolerance policy for harassment at Terranea and that every complaint received thorough investigation.  
“Every canceled event at Terranea takes precious hours away from our housekeepers, our banquet staff and employees throughout the resort,” Haack wrote. “It infuriates me that the burden of the boycott is falling on the very employees the union pretends to be eager to protect.” 
Vandenberg said the University should schedule a meeting with USG within a month of receiving the resolution, which will be sent to various leaders at the University in the next few days.
“So, it’s not to say that the University can never contract with them again, but to temporarily severe and disaffiliate itself from that resort until [the resort] creates a culture and a workplace of dignity for all workers,” Vandenberg said. 
Murphy hopes USG will hold University leaders accountable. 
“Now that [the resolution] is passed, we have the opportunity … to make sure that this resolution lands on the desks of the dozens of administrators that we added as recipients of the resolution,” Murphy said. “Now our responsibility is personally following up with each individual administrator.” 
USG will now present the resolution to University administrators including Keck Medicine of USC CEO Thomas E. Jackiewicz, Keck School of Medicine Dean Laura Mosqueda, Athletic Director Lynn Swann, Vice President for Student Affairs Ainsley Carry, Provost Michael Quick and Interim President Wanda Austin.
“We have an impact [on] different communities whether we recognize it ourselves or not,” Murphy said. “It would be really meaningful to see a long term culture shift in USC.”

The Longhorns had committed a cardinal sin, despite seizing a late fourth-quarter lead. They left Texas Tech’s offense with an eternity of time — 89 seconds to be precise. 
And so, Texas Tech quarterback Graham Harrell went to work. An eight-yard completion. A five-yard checkdown. An 11-yard pass here. A 10-yard gain there. As methodical as Sherman’s March, the Red Raiders had driven deep into Longhorn territory with just eight seconds to go. Everyone in the stadium and their grandmas at home expected a heave into the end zone. Four-verticals is the foundation of head coach Mike Leach’s offense, after all. But where the rest zigged, the Red Raiders zagged. 
On 2nd-and-10 from the Texas 28-yard line, Harrell launched a pass to All-American receiver Michael Crabtree about five yards short of the end zone. Harrell’s trust in Crabtree was rewarded, and the receiver broke free from a pair of defenders, rumbling into the end zone. No. 7 Texas Tech secured an upset over No. 1 Texas. Fans overflowed onto AT&T Field when there was still one second left on the clock, a chaotic scene, fitting since the Red Raiders had just flipped the college football world on its head in more ways than one. 
Texas Tech, the air-raid offense and Harrell had arrived. Leach’s schemes could no longer be considered gimmicky or only feasible for programs on the fringe. Not when those schemes had been instrumental in taking down the nation’s top team. 
Ten years later, Leach is now the head coach of Washington State and traces of his air-raid offense can be seen everywhere, from Texas high school football to the Kansas City Chiefs. And Harrell, who quarterbacked the Red Raiders to their biggest win in school history, is all grown up. He was hired as USC’s offensive coordinator after cutting his teeth in the same role at North Texas. At USC, he will attempt to replicate his accomplishments at Texas Tech with a program nowhere near the fringes. 
With spring football just around the corner, Harrell is tasked with revitalizing a dormant USC offense hamstrung by inexperience, a lack of discipline and nonsensical play-calling. That process will start with continuing to develop precocious quarterback JT Daniels, who was a true freshman last season. 
Stop me if you’ve heard this one before, but Daniels should have stayed in high school last season. It showed many times, like when he went 6-for-16 on pass attempts against Utah or when he tossed a pair of interceptions at UCLA. 
In 2018, Amon-Ra St. Brown acted as Daniels’ security blanket — the freshman receiver led all Trojans with 60 receptions. When St. Brown was covered, Daniels ran into trouble. Take Daniels’ first quarter interception against Texas, for example. From the moment the ball is snapped, his eyes are locked onto St. Brown. When it’s obvious he’s coated by a defender, Daniels hesitates, then throws it in St. Brown’s direction anyways, gifting Texas cornerback Kris Boyd an interception. USC would lose that game 37-14. 
This season, Daniels needs to get better at moving through his progressions and processing information quicker. Harrell’s offense could be a godsend in this regard. The air-raid offense is all about simplifying pass concepts and helping quarterbacks find receivers in man coverage. 
In a Los Angeles Times profile on air-raid offenses, former Texas Tech quarterback Sonny Combie said, “My whole time at Tech, we didn’t add new plays. We had 20 plays we ran really well.” 
Since then, the system has evolved under Leach’s disciples, like Kliff Kingsbury and Harrell, to include more read-option and spread concepts. But, the fundamentals are the same: Send receivers deep on almost every play so the signal caller can either exploit one-on-one matchups deep or check down to the flat or middle of the field, where receivers have cleared out space. 
Last season, USC’s plays were often too slow to develop, with Daniels faking one or two handoffs before throwing it to a receiver on a screen, for example. Plays like these will be largely eliminated under Harrell, with an emphasis on getting the ball out as quickly as possible. 
“Don’t think — play,” Harrell said of his philosophy at a press conference in Heritage Hall. 
It’s a fitting mantra from Harrell, whose fearless style of play at Texas Tech helped him shatter several NCAA records (he’s the Football Bowl Subdivision’s fourth all-time leader in pass yards). Plus, he helped develop one young quarterback into an elite passer at North Texas. Mason Fine led the Conference USA in pass yards in 2018, his third season in Harrell’s system. 
When Texas Tech trailed by 1 point with 89 seconds left against Texas in 2008, Harrell didn’t think. He played within the air-raid philosophy that had become second nature. Now, it’s his job to help Daniels reach that point.
