These past 48 hours in the sports world have made up for the monthslong hiatus. The world hasn’t witnessed such cross-league solidarity with a single social movement before. The WNBA, NBA, MLB and MLS all saw game postponements as players refused to detract attention away from the police shooting of Jacob Blake in Kenosha, Wis., which left him paralyzed from the waist down.
The WNBA’s Washington Mystics wore shirts spelling out Blake’s name with seven bullet holes drawn on the back. The NBA’s Milwaukee Bucks didn’t even take to the court Wednesday night, choosing to remain huddled in the locker room in an attempt to get through to the Wisconsin Attorney General. That night, no sports outlet had new stats updates for any major sporting league. 
Across the front page of its Thursday sports section, the New York Times bolded the word “boycott.” The paper got it wrong.
This is not a boycott — it’s a strike. Players are withholding their labor to make a statement that Black people cannot be celebrated on a court of play then brutalized in society. The pros are no doubt following the lead of activists around the world, but they may be following in the footsteps of another group: student-athletes.
Less than a month ago, a conglomeration of Pac-12 football players penned a letter in The Players’ Tribune, writing about the simultaneous dependency on Black athletes and disregard for proper compensation. They refused to take the field until the commissioner addressed such issues, and the players called for a strike.
They weren’t alone, and they weren’t the first student-athletes in history to challenge the decision making of a conference and, ultimately, the NCAA. In fact, that’s really been the history of the NCAA: a board of insulated governors, commissioners and contract negotiators speaking on behalf of thousands of athletes whose input is an afterthought or completely ignored.
The force majeure 2020 is with a pandemic, protests and economic uncertainty has ripped away the decades-long PR project that makes up the foundation of the NCAA. The association has marketed itself as the powerhouse of opportunity — the only door young athletes can open to truly benefit from their talent. 
We all love the rags-to-riches stories sports provides the professional-level potential talent. University athletic programs are framed as the saviors of helpless individuals, as the only way out. This is a lie for the majority of college athletes who won’t go pro.
The association is a facade of legal loopholes and savior-complex imagery crumbling as more and more athletes stand up and speak out. It’s about damn time, and it’s the theme of this column. 
Over the next couple of months, I’ll dive into how we got to this boiling point, traveling from the Supreme Court to right here at USC, discussing what allows this shoddy foundation of an organization to still stand, and how ultimately it’s the athletes who fall through its cracks.
Sure, I’ll name drop Reggie Bush at some point, but his case was one unjust decision. I’m getting at the entire system that allowed such a case to occur. 
If you’re still reading this and have made it out to be a hit piece against the NCAA, you’d be absolutely correct, but don’t confuse it as a hit piece on college sports. There’s a difference. Competition among young talent on grand stages is a phenomenal thing. It provides countless jobs, fosters communities across universities and creates opportunities for unique growth among student-athletes. 
But we cannot depend on only one organization to dictate the rules of this process when its historic growth has failed to trickle down to the athletes who allow it to function in the first place. 
I know my plan for this column will change as college football starts back up and inevitably erupts in coronavirus cases, but I am also aware of the ever-changing state of protest that could completely flip the axis of the sports world. When considering what is the most important to write about — the history that is written in books or the history that is unfolding right now at the hands of Black activists and athletes — I choose the latter. 
Maybe the pros’ recent stance could be enough to push student-athletes in other conferences over the edge. If I’m being honest, I hope teams force the NCAA history books to close for a year. No rival game or tradition is worth the overshadowing of a momentous conversation surrounding Black Lives Matter. 
But, as we’ll see again and again in this column, it’s not those pageants or even student-athletes taking activist stances that the NCAA is worried about at the end of the day. It’s the money behind the matter.

In this tumultuous political climate, it often seems that the term “activism” is thrown around by everyone — politicians and Twitter pundits alike. Increased civic engagement and awareness have rapidly increased the use of the word “activism,” and the inevitable reality that has followed is one in which its definition is muddied and the threshold for what constitutes activism is lowered. 
One might assume this indicates a greater degree of acceptance for those who practice civil disobedience and social justice organizing. In practice, however, it begs the question of who exactly is benefitting from the fact that activism has suddenly moved from the fringes of society into mainstream culture. All things considered, it is extremely important for USC’s student body to understand who the popularization of activism serves. 
Activism is inherently shrouded in the idea of risking one’s comfort to challenge an injustice of some sort — whether it be social, economic or political, among other spheres — that exists within a particular system. While advocating for a cause by posting, engaging in discourse or spreading awareness about it is important, it is equally important (especially as the cause itself shifts into the mainstream) to understand the stratifications of activism and the degrees of effectiveness within each level. 
Still, though, the social shift toward celebrating activism in all its forms has reached a point where opportunists can claim the title of “activist” as a resume-booster in the hopes that those hiring within the political establishment will see it as a way to diversify the workforce and appease civil society. At face value, this may not seem like an issue: Some would argue it is a good thing that those who fight to achieve equity for marginalized communities are being granted a seat at the table. However, the broad umbrella under which “activism” now falls has allowed for some to unfairly capitalize and for oppressive systems to benefit. 
These aforementioned consequences explain how someone like Ziad “the Activist” Ahmed, who has branded himself as an average, self-starting student activist with progressive values (when in fact he is the son of a corporate multi-millionaire), was admitted to Ivy League universities by writing #BlackLivesMatter in his personal statement 100 times and started his own company. In stark contrast, young Black and brown organizers are brutalized and deemed enemies of the state by law enforcement. 
The latter group, often students, do not and cannot use the “profession” of activism to climb the corporate or political ladder because they are viewed as violent agitators — but it is these same people who do the hard work and don’t benefit with a brand deal or a job on The Hill. The people who incite genuine civil unrest and cultural change are deemed the foot soldiers — incredibly brave, nameless and faceless individuals who provoke and challenge powers at the risk of their safety and autonomy. There is often little to no praise for this line of work in a mainstream fashion. 
It is therefore immoral to compare Ahmed or any other self-proclaimed activist that has been welcomed by the corporate and political elite to the various organizers who have put their lives on the line to advocate for the defunding and abolition of police. Trying to brand “voting blue” as a form of activism (as Ahmed did in a TikTok video) does not hold a candle to standing in front of District Attorney Jackie Lacey’s office nearly every Wednesday demanding her resignation, at the risk of being harassed and abused by the police. 
This isn’t meant to dismiss or discount the importance of advocacy — when the masses begin to speak up about injustice, the sheer solidarity and strength in numbers can be enough to bend the will of elected officials, corporate powers and higher-education institutions. People should care about speaking up for their peers, even when they are not affected by the same injustices, because it is the bare minimum and an integral part of being a decent, compassionate person. 
The issue inherently lies in the fact that mainstream acceptance of “activism” is a farce. The current political, media and corporate powers have cherry-picked whose activism is worthy of media coverage and praise and whose activism is violent and dangerous because it makes them uncomfortable. However, it is often the latter group that really puts pressure on oppressive systems to change through tangible sacrifice, setting the foundation for and preceding all the social media and mainstream “activism” that follows. The distinction is necessary to make — put simply, it is important to recognize the work of those who are often viewed as agitators or aggressors when they demand justice and equity rather than only uplifting those whose activism is more palatable and moderate.

This summer saw the resignations of former Undergraduate Student Government President Truman Fritz and Vice President Rose Ritch after student activist efforts alleged that the former president had made anti-Black remarks on several occasions. Ritch stepped down after a formal impeachment complaint filed against her cited her silence and complicity in Fritz’s conduct.
These resignations beg the question of whether an informed electorate would have still voted the pair into power, especially considering that the pair was endorsed by the Daily Trojan and that the publication did not cover their violation of Section VIII.A.2 of the USG Elections Code, which restricts the use of mass messaging and spamming voters.
In the time leading up to the 2020-21 USG presidential election last semester, both of the most prominent student publications on campus remarked on the similarities between candidate platforms. Annenberg Media referred to the presidential debate as an opportunity for each ticket to distinguish itself while the Daily Trojan asked each ticket how they would differentiate themselves because of platform similarities.
While this may demonstrate that our student leaders are united in what needs to be addressed at USC, it also means that campus media must look beyond the platform and toward whether candidates have the skills and trust of the Trojan community to execute their goals. Every candidate can make promises but not every candidate can attest to whether they have been taking measured steps to ensure their goals are reached.   
The current process for an endorsement by the Daily Trojan is handled by a nine-person editorial board consisting of the managing and section editors, two opinion staffers and a non-news editor. Six members ask the same six questions to all tickets. This may prevent predispositions from affecting the endorsement process, but it does not constitute an adequately robust vetting process for such an important position. Currently, the endorsement is only based on the interviews to avoid favoritism of one ticket over others. The editorial board does not conduct extensive research on candidates themselves and does not ask specific questions of each ticket that would better probe each candidacy.
On top of their endorsement, the Daily Trojan offers a voting guide to provide its readers with an introduction to the presidential tickets. Annenberg Media does not endorse a candidate but hosts a debate and also offers voters a guide with video responses to questions by the candidates.
However, it is important to note that when these student publications are interviewing candidates, it should not be an opportunity for a ticket to wax poetic about their candidacy — rather, it should be an opportunity for campus media to do their part in critically considering the minutiae and specific actions of candidates’ platforms and their personal characters.
Campus media must get at something different. They must try, even if it’s uncomfortable, to get into the specifics of how a ticket would perform in office, their plan to accomplish their goals and how their day-to-day would look while also ensuring that each meets standards of sustainability, wellness, inclusion and administrative accountability. The Daily Trojan editorial board must strive to ask difficult questions that a typical voter would not have the opportunity to ask all while maintaining a transparent process throughout.
An endorsement should help educate voters on candidates and eventually lead to better-informed decisions at the ballot box. An endorsement from the Daily Trojan, for example, carries a prominent feature with a print circulation of 10,000 copies. In elections decided by just a couple hundred votes, this is ever-important.
These margins are particularly crucial as USG voter turnout remains low despite efforts to increase it. In the past five years, voting last peaked in 2015 with 6,027 voters and reached a record low in 2016 with 3,700 votes. Just under 24% of students voted in this year’s election, totaling 4,777 votes. Because of this, the responsibility cannot be entirely placed on campus media, as low student participation cannot be the norm.
As countless Daily Trojan articles have argued, students must be more engaged in the USG election process, particularly at a time when the student body deserves candidates that truly believe in their platforms, have acted on them previously and will continue to push the envelope to better our student body. A lack of trust in the efficacy of USG is quite prevalent on our campus. It is thus up to our student leaders and campus media to adequately probe each campaign to ensure that this summer’s debacle does not occur again.
