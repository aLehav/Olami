The storyline commanding national headlines last weekend was clear enough — Stanford quarterback Andrew Luck and USC junior quarterback Matt Barkley were set to face off as two of college football’s best quarterback prospects.
Of course, it played out about as well as anyone could have hoped, with the two gunslingers leading their respective teams to an incredible triple-overtime finish.
But as the matchup unfolded in front of an enormous crowd at the Coliseum, a similar storyline went wholly unnoticed as a result — the first meeting of second-year USC coach Lane Kiffin and the newly-employed Stanford coach David Shaw.
Much like the Barkley-Luck rivalry, Kiffin and Shaw share some similarities.
The two coaches are young — Kiffin is 36 and Shaw is 39 — and somewhat new to their current coaching positions. They had previous stints in the NFL, and coincidentally both were coaches in Oakland with the Raiders.
Both held offensive coordinator positions at the schools they now coach — Kiffin was with the Trojans from 2001 to 2006, acting as the offensive coordinator in his last two years, while Shaw served as the Cardinal offensive coordinator from 2007 to 2010— and enjoyed considerable success during that time. Kiffin was an integral part of USC’s 2003 and 2004 national championship teams, while Shaw turned the previously stagnant Stanford offense into a well-oiled machine.
But the greatest similarity, it seemed, was that both coaches had something substantial to prove.
Kiffin, of course, has been branded as a coach without a “signature win” in his two seasons at USC, having failed to close out several major games against ranked opponents. Some of his decisions in the past — on the field and off — have been questionable, prompting doubters to suggest he is too young and immature to be a head coach.
On top of everything, he has faced inflated expectations of success, despite dealing with sanctions that were essentially placed in his lap.
Shaw, on the other hand, faced critics not for his previous work, but because of the expectations he had to fulfill. Former Stanford coach Jim Harbaugh has become something of a legend in Northern California, and was directly responsible for the turnaround of the program in the last five years. When Harbaugh left to coach the NFL’s San Francisco 49ers, Shaw had his work cut out for him.
Much like the Barkley-Luck battle, there was no doubt that Saturday would prove to be a test for both Kiffin and Shaw.
One-hundred and four points, three overtimes and a fantastic finish later, it seems both coaches came out ahead.
As Kiffin and Shaw took turns raising the bar offensively, it became apparent that the quality of each side’s talent was only rivaled by the coaching that led them.
For the most part, Kiffin’s game was devoid of the usual questionable decisions. He continued to trust the run game, which paid dividends in the form of junior tailback Curtis McNeal’s two touchdowns, and set Barkley up with passing plays that continuously exposed a weakened Stanford secondary.
Shaw showed no signs of being a first-year coach, even when his team faced a seven-point deficit late in the game.
The Stanford offense posted long scoring drives when it needed them most, and matched USC blow for blow — especially impressive considering the Trojans’ consistently great field position after kickoffs.
Kiffin didn’t get a signature win.
But in a week in which expectations soared so high that a blowout loss would have devastated the Trojans, he got about as close as he possibly could have.
It’s not often you see a coach praised for his work in a losing effort, but there has been no shortage of support from fans and media alike.
As for Shaw, he now heads back to Stanford with a No. 4 ranked team and national title hopes still intact. Not bad for Harbaugh’s fill-in.
Most media, analysts and fans were eager to talk about Barkley and Luck in the aftermath of Saturday’s contest. But to a large degree, what transpired at the Coliseum showed that Kiffin and Shaw are ready for the bright lights of the college football national stage.

For the first time since 2006, the USC women’s basketball team has landed in the preseason Associated Press top-25 poll.
Returning its core group of players from last season, which includes senior guards Jacki Gemelos, Briana Gilbreath and Ashley Corral, junior forward Christina Marinacci and sophomore forward Cassie Harberts, No. 23 USC enters the 2011-12 season after advancing to last year’s Women’s National Invitational Tournament title game.

“It’s obviously great for our program to be ranked among the top 25 teams in the country,” USC coach Michael Cooper said in a statement. “I think the rankings are reflecting what we’ve done in the past two years, and it’s an honor to be ranked. But we still have some steps to take to really solidify ourselves.”
Despite posting a 19-12 record in the regular season, the Women of Troy were not selected for the NCAA tournament. USC, however, still advanced to the WNIT title game before falling to Toledo.
“We’re really happy where we’re at right now,” Gilbreath said. “That postseason experience was great for us. We built a lot of team chemistry and bonded a lot.”
The Women of Troy have plenty of experience and their incoming recruiting class was ranked No. 8 in the nation, featuring guards Ariya Cook and Kiki Alofaituli, and forwards Deanna Calhoun and Alexyz Vaioletama.
“The group as a whole is a very, very strong recruiting class,” Gilbreath said. “They’re definitely bringing a lot of talent to our team and they’re going to do a great job for us this year.”
The Women of Troy were also picked to finish second in the Pac-12 Coaches Poll, while Stanford received the most votes for the top spot, California came in third and UCLA was selected to finish fourth.
In 2006, USC’s last appearance in the NCAA tournament, the Women of Troy held down the No. 19 spot in the Associated Press top-25 poll after a season-opening win. They opened the season No. 22 in the preseason poll that same year.
“I think it’s where we belong,” Corral said. “We can definitely build on it, though. It proves we have been working hard and our postseason push last year is exactly what we needed to be confident going into this season.”

USC coach Lane Kiffin has been reprimanded and fined $10,000 by the Pac-12, conference commissioner Larry Scott announced Monday.
Following Saturday’s triple-overtime loss to Stanford, Kiffin said he was “extremely disappointed” with the officials, claiming a referee told him USC would be granted a timeout with one second remaining in regulation after a replay showed sophomore wide receiver Robert Woods’ knee was down in bounds.
“The Pac-12 has specific rules that prohibit our coaches from making public comments about officiating, and this prohibition specifically includes comments that create doubts about the credibility of the Conference’s officiating program,” Scott said in a statement. “The Conference expects each Pac-12 coach to adhere to our standards of conduct and to conduct himself or herself in a manner which will reflect credit on the institution and the Conference.”
In addition, junior safety T.J. McDonald was suspended for the first half of USC’s game at Colorado on Friday for a 15-yard targeting penalty he received on Stanford’s final drive in regulation.
The coach’s comments did not “create doubts about the credibility of the Conference’s officiating program.”  The officiating did.  And does.  And has, for the last decade, at least.
Although I am completely on Kiffin’s side on this issue he gets paid enough to cover the fine.  If you want a collection, go hit up the trustees…they’ve got tons of disposable funds!
Back on the subject though, I hate when leagues fine players/coaches expressing their opinions and commenting on the reality of controversial events/calls.  They should just own up to the mistakes made and that’s that.
I would love to see a collection taken up by the students of USC to cover this absurd NCAA fine.  I, for one, am extremely proud that Coach Kiffin did not just ‘roll over and take it’ when the program was subjected to injustice, as other administrators have done.  Kiffin is showing the true spirit behind ‘FIGHT ON’ – and I believe if students and alums were to cover this fine – one dollar at a time, it would make immediate national news (if shared properly) and show the country (and Coach Kiffin) that we are completely behind his efforts and appreciate his fighting for us in an increasingly corrupt NCAA/BCS era.   Faithful.  Scholarly.  Skillful, Courageous, Ambitious.  Just the qualities we want in a USC Trojan.  Thank you Coach!

USC associate head coach Bob Cantu’s office, nestled in the corner of the athletic pavilion attached to the Galen Center, remains a shrine to the recent success of the men’s basketball program.
Cream of the crop · Over the last 11 years, USC associate head coach Bob Cantu has recruited a bevy of talent for USC through four different head coaching tenures. - Photo courtesy of USC Sports Information
Jerseys of first-round NBA draft picks Cantu coached at USC, including DeMar DeRozan, Taj Gibson and Nick Young, adorn the walls, as well as pictures from historic moments, such as the 2009 Pac-10 basketball tournament championship.
“I am running out of wall space,” Cantu said. “I will have to take something down for Nikola [Vucevic’s] jersey once the NBA season begins. I will need a new office if we keep getting draft picks.”
Longevity is not usually a term associated with collegiate assistant coaches, but Cantu’s reputation for working behind-the-scenes to recruit, developing and mentoring players has helped him to remain at USC for 11 seasons — a period that has spanned four different head coaches. He is the longest tenured men’s basketball assistant or head coach in the Pac-12.
“I do not have a secret,” Cantu said. “I just work hard and try to do a great job every day.”
Over the years, Cantu has developed a strong affinity for the program and the school, something he eagerly expresses when stressing the benefits of attending USC to recruits.
“[Cantu] loves USC,” USC coach Kevin O’Neill said. “He really believes in the place, so it is not like he is in sales. He can sell it from the heart.”
Cantu and the Trojan coaching staff credit much of their recruiting success to eschewing the practice of targeting as many players as possible.
“I recruit less guys harder,” Cantu said. “I try to lock-in on a guy or two that we really want.”
One of the recruits Cantu focused on was Alexis Moore, now a 6-foot-2 freshman guard at USC. Moore began speaking with Cantu during his sophomore year of high school in 2009 at Long Beach Poly.
“He made me feel welcome and as though I was already a part of the family, even though I had not committed yet,” Moore said.
As the recruitment process progressed, Cantu and Moore communicated once a week. Cantu would talk about classes available to USC students, Moore’s role on the team and even the prevalence of beautiful women on campus.
“Literally anything a kid could want, he talked about,” Moore said. “If there was beach-front property in Colorado, he probably could have sold it to me.”
Cantu learned the art of recruiting as an assistant coach at Cuesta College in San Louis Obispo, Calif., where he attracted players to a program with facilities that paled in comparison with those at most Division I institutions.
“It is nobody’s dream to go to a junior college,” Cantu said. “The key is to be consistent and persistent, but not pushy.”
After his tenure at Cuesta College, Cantu spent a year and a half at Sacramento State before coming to USC.
When Cantu arrived on campus in 2002, USC was not a simple sell to basketball recruits. The Trojans still played at the antiquated Los Angeles Sports Arena and had only appeared in the NCAA tournament twice in the previous 10 seasons.
USC, which now plays in the Galen Center, has competed in the NCAA tournament the last four years it was eligible for postseason competition.
“[USC] has always been known as a football school, but I think we have been able to show that we are able to compete at a high level in basketball,” Cantu said.
Cantu is more than just a recruiter. He frequently works with perimeter and post players in practice, and even filled in for O’Neill as head coach during the semifinal game of the 2011 Pac-10 tournament against Arizona when O’Neill was serving a suspension.
“[Cantu] would be a great head coach,” O’Neill said. “He has earned an opportunity. He is a guy who should really skip the low or mid-major level, and start at a high-major job.”
Cantu has received head coaching offers, but is patiently waiting for the right opportunity.
“I feel I am prepared to be a head coach,” Cantu said. “The opportunity really has to be the perfect situation because I really enjoy being at USC and working for [O’Neill].”

Having a consistent exercise routine is crucial for staying fit. But, in the hubbub of college life, it’s hard to maintain stable routines. For a couple months, a combination of birthday-related indulgences and a midterm-heavy schedule left me out of shape, with no time to exercise.
Everyone knows it’s important to rebuild solid exercise habits, but oftentimes the efforts we make fail to get us back to previous levels.
Fortunately, this hiatus wasn’t the first time I’ve had to restart following an excursion away from healthy living — be it from sickness or travel. Recently, through trial and error, my friends and I have figured out the best plan to not only jumpstart the body back into its old exercise routine, but also to provide challenging workouts along the way.
The most important thing, above all else, is to have a plan. Last week I took five days to exercise, leaving two in the middle for rest. Gradual adjustment rarely works; the key is to retrain all aspects of physical performance.
Each new workout should be designed to achieve a higher level of exertion. The key is to exercise at a tougher pace than you did in your old routine. Bruce Lee once said, “There are no limits. There are plateaus, but you must not stay there, you must go beyond them.”
Run farther or do one more set — aim for something more so your new record doesn’t become a new plateau you’re struggling to break past.
With strength training, which I did two times during the week, one gets a full-body workout. Some will say to train the arms and chest one day and core and legs the next. But working the whole body is a great way to jumpstart muscles and train the body for complex movements in every muscle group.
One of the best ways to revamp your fitness regimen is to follow a circuit-training workout, where each circuit involves one core, one lower body and one upper body exercise. Squats, incline presses, a number of sit-ups and a finishing circuit of plyometrics not only target each muscle group but simultaneously increase muscle strength with muscle mass (while connected, there are different training methods for building both).
It’s essential to work on endurance while working on strength. This can be cycling or running, but the goal is to rebuild cardiovascular strength, which can fall faster than muscle strength when an exercise habit falters. Aim to go a quarter more or longer than you usually do. If your average run is two miles, run two and a half. Get the blood flowing and work on breathing. Aim for longevity and sustainability, rather than speed. Endurance training benefits the heart more than a quick dash.
Endurance is useful, but training the body to move more efficiently makes new endurance practical. Strength training builds muscle and running or cycling helps with endurance, but coordination and balance are essential to make these aspects effective. Find an activity that focuses on balance and the control of movement. I do parkour; my friend tried yoga. The result is the same. Being fast or able to run a long distance is good, but whatever you do needs to be coupled with redirecting motion.
Then there’s the skill aspect. All of these workouts aim to rebuild essential components of a fit body, but they still need to be put to work to build precision. In this case, sports are the best, and the most enjoyable, solution.
For example, boxing, either sparring with a partner or hitting the punching bag, requires twisting and turning the entire body to strike a specific spot at a rapid-fire rate. The repetition and speed of boxing not only train hand-eye coordination, but also sharpen reflexes that often dull through inactivity. Find a sport that requires repetitive and accurate actions to direct your regained strength. Do this on the same day as the movement workout to hone the precision aspects of physical training.
Ideally, these four components complement each other. Completed in the course of a week, these workouts help energize the body and get every muscle working again. The longer it takes to get back to exercising, the harder it is to get back into it, and the more likely you are to only do small sets, such as only working the arms, or a lapse back into inactivity. But by having a strict plan for concentrated exercise, the risk is negated.
It’s easy to become overwhelmed and let fitness suffer in the face of other tasks. But it’s just as hard to restart a workout regime. It doesn’t mean it’s impossible; it just requires concentration and effort.

Come Fly Away is hard to categorize. Fourteen top-notch dancers, a live group of big-band musicians and Frank Sinatra’s smooth vocals combine to form something sure to please anyone with a touch of swing-era nostalgia.
Standout couple · Betsy (Mallauri Esquibel) and Marty (Ron Todorowski) are one of the play’s four couples, living their romance onstage with palpable chemistry and dazzling moves, such as Marty’s backflip. - Photo courtesy of Joan Marcus
In the show, a group of exceptionally good-looking dancers happen to stumble into the same bar on the same night. Performers speak through flirtatious, exaggerated gestures and seductive dance moves. Come Fly Away hardly resembles a structured play or musical, though. The lack of dialogue limits plot depth, but 80 minutes of superb dancing redeem the show with excitement and flair. Sinatra’s catalogue of recordings contains plenty of love songs to tell a drawn-out story and the spectacle that results is a solidly entertaining way to spend an evening.
Show director Twyla Tharp’s numbers offer no surprises; the characters are meant to follow a cliché timeline where couples meet cute other halves, coyly start going steady, hit a bump in the road and finally dance their way into Fred Astairian heaven.
With the bar setting, Tharp creates the type of scene in which we picture Sinatra thriving — drinks flowing, women oozing sex appeal and the bartender acting like everyone’s best friend. But one major flaw in the bar are the drinks — there are none. Actors unconvincingly swish invisible martinis and whiskeys before jumping out of their chairs to perform to another swingin’ tune.
Ron Todorowski, who previously performed on Broadway in Wicked, Guys and Dolls and Footloose, plays Marty the bartender, whose mastery of jazz, ballet and swing moves makes him a standout performer. His no-hands backflip deserves as much applause as Sinatra’s flawless rendition of “I Did It My Way.”
Betsy (Mallauri Esquibel) plays Marty’s love interest. Her cutesy demeanor creates a palpable onstage chemistry between her and Marty, comprising one of four couples living out their romance onstage.
Kate (Marceea Moreno) and Hank (Martin Harvey), the hot couple in the bunch, join Marty and Betsy. Kate shamelessly flaunts her sexuality, while Hank waits for her to drunkenly fall into his arms so he can whisk her away. Kate’s sexuality often dominates each number she appears in, making it easy to forget or ignore the other dancers. She looks great in skin-revealing outfits, but they detract from her talent. The audience comes to see Kate as a bombshell. She succeeds in “acting” because of her exaggerated facial expressions and physical insinuations directed toward Hank.
Sid (John Selya) and Slim (Tanairi Sade Vasquez) are a couple with a fiery passion for dance and romance. Sid’s cockiness and physical ability resemble Gene Kelly’s, especially in his performance of “I Like To Lead When I Dance.” He and Slim butt heads as dance leaders, but Slim eventually gives in to Sid’s charm, despite her desire to dance to her own beat.
Chanos and Babe, the fourth couple, are less featured in the show, but Matthew Stockwell Dibble and Marielys Molina make for strong additions to the already overpowering cast of dancers. Babe’s moves are as seductive as Kate’s, but her supporting role does not allow her much time to show off. She takes care of drunkards, such as Chanos who cannot care for themselves.
Tharp’s choreography rightly characterizes each couple as the moves reflect to the dancers’ personality traits. Some are shy, some are flirty and some let attraction take over the dance floor. Six additional dancers bolster the ensemble, dancing mostly in the background or in unison with the group when the entire company takes the stage.
Specifically frustrating points in the show come when a signature Sinatra song, for example “Luck Be A Lady,” plays, and the performers just dance. At any moment the audience should expect to see one of the dancers finally belt out the chorus of “Luck Be A Lady,” but that moment never arrives.
To accompany Sinatra on vocals, the show employs a live group of underrated star musicians led by conductor Rob Cookman. The live band plays over Sinatra’s recorded vocals, seamlessly convincing the audience Sinatra’s ghost is hiding somewhere backstage and singing live into a microphone.
Ultimately, Come Fly Away is an unorthodox weaving of live music, professional dancing and incomparable vocal talent. If only Ol’ Blue Eyes were around to see the show.
The two-week engagement at the Pantages Theater runs through Nov. 6.

Calling fans of Animal Collective, The Beach Boys, Phoenix, Bruce Springstein: Australian native Little Red recently dropped its new album, Midnight Remember. After releasing its introductory album Listen To Little Red in the United States in 2009, the ’50s-inspired rockers are back with some downright captivating tunes, making the album a must buy for music lovers of all ages and tastes.
Little Red kicks off Midnight Remember with “Get a Life,” an experimental love child of Animal Collective and The Beach Boys. The new wave elements found on this track, mixed with The Beach Boys’ inspired harmonies, are recipes for an exciting sound. It’s the perfect choice for an opener: It’s a familiar yet intriguing sound that leaves you wondering how the album will continue.
“Slow Motion” beautifully complements the opener by immediately drawing you in with transfixing production. The echoing, breathy vocals are intriguing and the piano sounds like something Sara Bareilles could have churned out over a glorious new wave The Beach Boys beat. The pop-meets-atmospheric sounds are captivating and immersive. “Slow Motion” sounds like everyone and no one at the same time.
Though the band takes its experimental sound seriously, it also knows how to craft catchy pop tunes. “Rock It,” the lead single that has already taken over the air waves down under, is an ’80s dancehall jam with catchy lyrics and vocal production that you can’t help but sing along to. “Rock It” is a summer song at heart, but it still keeps you listening and wanting more as the band sings Rock it till the break of day / don’t stop rocking now, no way / everybody feels the same / this is why we play these games.
What would a California record be without classic west coast tunes like “Rock It” and “Little Bit of Something?” With surfer vibes from the get-go, these songs sound classic but new. It’s evident Little Red is getting radio-friendly with its rocking harmonies as well as its chill and comforting beach vibes. Get ready, PCH.
But Midnight Remember isn’t all effervescent pop. The band offers a nice change of pace from the beach jams with “All Mine,” “In My Bed” and “I Can’t Wait.” “Mine” slowly reels you in with unfamiliar vocal arrangements: broken up syllables, less production, echoing guitars built up to a climactic crescendo through the use of gnarly vocals.
Conversely, “In My Bed” begins with a startling opening and messy production. That being said, the alternative mariachi sound is chaotically beautiful.
“I Can’t Wait” focuses more on experimentation and it does so from the start. The track has an aesthetically arresting trance-like feeling.
Despite these varying styles, Little Red maintains cohesion toward the end of the album. “February” carries more of a relaxing tone through the simplicity of the instrumentation with a touch of whirring cymbals in the background that builds a solid base for harmonies on a song about the seasons — It’s summer now / but not for long.
The album beautifully revisits the opening tracks with “Chelsworth” which serves as a slowed down “Rock It” that intrigues listeners by reworking the production of one of the band’s own tunes on the same record. The opening is simply stunning, particularly with its experimental use of the harmonica. This is one of the stand-out tracks on the album.
The album closes out with “Follow You There,” harboring a Temper Trap meets Coldplay feel that is pretty and simple, enabling the remembrance and feeling of true love. Hauntingly beautiful, “Follow You There” builds to epic proportions as the piano and synth blend harmoniously into an eruption of sonic pleasure.
Little Red has created crossover, boundary-breaking tunes in a forward-thinking album. Midnight Remember is bold, dynamic and flourishes with its ability to provide universal appeal.

The NBA season was supposed to start today, but after the expiration of the league’s collective bargaining agreement July 1, the players and team owners have struggled to agree on new terms — mainly how to divide $4 billion in basketball-related income.
These successful owners and basketball players, who have long served as role models in the business community and for the general population, should now be viewed as less than ideal citizens.
Julia Vann | Daily Trojan
They have allowed greed and  self-interest to get in the way of the well-being of thousands of displaced workers and the emotional escapism that sports so often provide for a country already in the midst of difficult times.
Following one of the highest-rated playoffs in league history, the NBA’s popularity should only be rising. It should be a victory for the game of basketball and everyone involved, including players, fans, owners and employees.
Instead, a full 82-game season is no longer a possibility, but the ramifications are worse than one might initially imagine.
Players and owners alike roll into labor negotiation meetings clad in designer suits with their BMWs and Rolls Royces, yet the sides resemble two boys at a playground squabbling over the basketball until the sun goes down, and the rest of the children can’t play and have to go home.
Those dejected children are the many businesses and employees that rely on the league for financial security. While they are surrounded by their own wealth, they refuse to see the direct harm they are causing to those around them.
Students, who fall into the sport’s key demographic, should take note of the way players and owners have let greed get the best of each other. Players and owners have tarnished what used to be a successful and profitable relationship.
College students are sometimes thrust into situations where greed is involved. Group projects are a prime example. Students want to get a good grade, but most don’t want to put in the work for it. Equally dividing the work between the partners is an adequate compromise.
Though most of us will never be involved in such high-profile negotiations with the ability to alter the lives of thousands of employees, the old elementary school lesson of “treat others how you want to be treated” is at play here.
Compromise is something players and owners should adopt. We must concern ourselves with the externalities of our decisions, especially when greed is in play.
Each of the NBA’s 29 arenas employs approximately 1,000 individuals who work concessions, security and cleanup, and each team has its own facility and office employees who face devastating pay-cuts and layoffs.
Don’t forget everyone involved in television broadcasts, radio stations, sports journalism, athletic retail, sports bars and local restaurants and hotels.
Given that the NBA is an indirect source of income for small businesses, independent bars will lose anywhere from $10,000 to $14,000 because of players’ and owners’ greed.
Congratulations, players and owners. Your greed has successfully left tens of thousands of people struggling to get by, while you enjoy an extended vacation with the security of millions in savings for either playing or watching a game.
The individuals who once served as some of the most visible role models in American culture are now the wealthy and the greedy. In these times of economic strife, this is the last thing blue-collar Americans need to hear about.
And with players vacating the country looking for places to play abroad, their loyalty, which kept many fans loyal to the sport and the league, must be called into question.
Before this lockout, fans could remember a time when athletes like Los Angeles Lakers guard Kobe Bryant and Dallas Mavericks forward Dirk Nowitzki were praised for their unwavering loyalty to a single team and applauded for pouring an incredible amount of effort into a career they loved and appreciated.
They could respect former defensive stalwart Dikembe Mutombo for donating at least $15 million to build a hospital in the Democratic Republic of Congo or New York Knicks forward Amar’e Stoudemire for funding and building water wells in Sierra Leone.
Now, the lockout has tarnished this image and exposed fans to the ugly side of sports and unearthed the mechanism of money driving the operations behind a beautiful game. To the players, the green apparently means more than the glory, and that is unacceptable. We must be careful we don’t fall into the same trap.

Residents expressed mixed opinions about USC’s plan for The Village at an open house at the Galen Center last Thursday. Though The Village will certainly offer a notably nicer face of USC and its surrounding community, the plans for construction lack consideration for the history and significance of the area.
Esther Cheong | Daily Trojan
Inherent in any efforts at modernization is the destruction of past efforts, past culture and perhaps memories. USC should recognize that building The Village not only involves construction but destruction, and that its claims of improving the quality of life assert a clear form of cultural supremacy.
Accompanying these intentions is a clear loss of many defining features of USC. Closing the street from cars means closing off the street from food trucks, which add flavor to USC’s local cuisine at that particularly convenient location. Likewise, many of the unique restaurants and stores in University Village will be eliminated and replaced by larger chains, increasing the presence of big businesses, while pushing more individualized flavors into further obscurity.
The initial reactions at the open house, however, suggest a shared consensus among students that construction of The Village is a good thing.
The plans for The Village at USC are quite ambitious. The plan is expected to take at least eight years, with construction beginning in mid-2012. It is expected that approximately 8,000 construction jobs and 4,000 permanent positions will be created by the project.
Concern, as discussed in the Daily Trojan article “Residents unsure about The Village,” seems restricted primarily to local, non-student residents. Their concerns centered on the idea that The Village will be too student-centered, catering to a more wealthy student population than the less-affluent surrounding area.
USC has, to my knowledge, every legal right to allow for the completion of this project. It is this great power that USC possesses over the area that magnifies its responsibility toward considering the implications of its actions.
But the implications of the construction of The Village stretch far beyond the shopping options presented or whether affordable food from Superior  Grocers will no longer be easily available.
The improvements seem to be well intentioned enough. When completed, The Village will be closed off from cars, promoting a safer environment for pedestrians and bicyclists and the intention to build a DPS substation within the center reflects USC’s further commitment to student safety. Certainly promoting everybody’s safety would be desired almost ubiquitously.
Calling The Village an improvement to this area is in many ways difficult to dispute. Cleaner facilities, increased safety and improved student-housing — these are all changes that anybody would advocate. But does improvement mean transforming USC into more of an oasis among urbanity, a setting drastically differing from its surrounding areas?
More green space and more lighting are great for safety, but they establish a clearly different ambiance. Is USC trying to transform its part of Los Angeles into the posh, upscale Westwood?
USC is making a muscle-flexing statement with the construction of The Village. Certainly, USC commands jurisdiction over the area and is backed with massive funds, supportive alumni, students and faculty. The construction of The Village, accompanied by the destruction of the current University Village and surrounding buildings, seems largely unstoppable.
The U.V. is our weird, eerie shopping center. It’s a place where you can buy placental shampoo at the local grocery store. But it’s ours and it’s intrinsically a part of the Trojan experience and our community as a whole.
Destroying it only makes it another strip mall in a neighborhood filled with them. I’ll take a sub from Sandwich Island at the UV over yet another Quiznos in a Stepford Wives shopping center any day of the week.

While I personally love Trader Joe’s, replacing Superior Market with it would create a hardship for so many locals.  With all of USC’s entrepreneurial resources, perhaps USC can come up with a way to assist Superior Market to remake it’s business model so that this store becomes a model that serves both students and the surrounding community who have come to rely on it’s low cost food.  That way, USC is truly helping to offer better quality food to low income residents and students without having to drive outside of this locale.  I cringe when I think that UV will turn into something like the Grove!  We are asked to donate to the Good Neighbors Campaign and in that lies a tremendous responsibility to the community, not just students whose parents are footing their bills.
@ Jason
The increase in University owned housing (not to mention the increase in privately owned student housing that has been and still is under construction) would drive DOWN rent in the area due to increased competition.
Furthermore, attracting retailers like Trader Joe’s would mean that affordable produce would still be available.  Not only does Trader Joe’s offer low prices, comparable to those at Superior, the quality of their produce far exceeds that of the produce available at Superior.  Sure, they don’t sell ALL the same things, but Smart and Final is 3 blocks away, and Food 4 Less is 8 blocks away for any cleaning-supply or bulk-food buys.
Finally, the new development will INCREASE the number of jobs available, bot in the short term and in the long term.  Eight THOUSAND construction jobs ON TOP OF four THOUSAND permenant jobs.
@Thomas and John M
The downside is that many local and community-owned businesses will be forced to move out due to these modernization efforts. USC has an incredibly contentious history with the surrounding community and destroying the UV will only exacerbate these tensions and further contribute to the gentrification of the area. While you both argue that this new plan will be good for “everyone,” this modernization is certainly not helping the local community – the working class residents will see their rents driven up and their jobs given to commuter employees, making it nearly impossible for them to stay in the area.
I wish that I cared. But I don’t.
The UV is shot, and the university is derelict if it allows the facility to remain.
Thanks for an article that rightly addresses community concerns about USC’s development in the area.
I wonder how many top-caliber students, faculty members, and staff have considered USC over the years, only to ultimately choose somewhere else due to the neighborhood (the village, being USC-adjacent and in the heart of USC-centric North University Park, no doubt playing a huge role in this). 
Forgive me for thinking people might want better neighborhood entertainment options than a two screen theater with mysteriously sticky surfaces. I’ll concede that UV food is good though.
I was a freshman in 1975 when UV was completed. How exciting to have a real shopping center (I think that’s what we called it back then) so close. As I recall, the market was called 32nd Street Market, and there were a few other stores open at the beginning along with the new  B of A.  Soon thereafter, Jefferson was widened to its current state between Vermont and Fig.  That was progress.  Cardinal Gardens was under construction and would open in time for my soph year in ’76.
Now, as a father of a senior, and having explored UV over the past 4 years when visiting, all I can say, it is time for it to go. I have seen tremendous change over the last 30 years……and the plans for the new center and the north area will further add to the area.  100% benefits……..no downside.   (PS…great game last Saturday night!!!!! One of the best ever………Great weekend- Thanks!)
Pretty disingenuous to desribed the proposed Village as just “another strip mall”.  You’ve seen the renderings, right?
But replacing Superior Grocers with Trader Joe’s would be be problematic for the blue-collar residents.
This is probably the worst article I have read in the DT. The “argument” was so amateurish I would have thought it was written by a freshman in high school, not a world-class University.  Hopefully Mr. Wong will continue to grow in his writing and analytical skills because he has a long way to go.
Are you high?
Have you seen the UV Village? It is an unmitigated dump, by any standards.
This is good for everyone. There is no downside and you certainly have not made a case.

In mtvU’s newest season of Student Bodies, a team of two from USC faces a team from UCLA in various fitness-oriented challenges. The winner of the competiton will receive an all-expenses-paid trip to MTV’s Spring Break in Las Vegas, as well as a yearlong bottomless supply of Gatorade G-Series products. This week’s episode, a seven-minute short, featured the two teams battling it out in a baseline-fitness competition.
Sophomore Kelton McMains, a member of the club water polo team and an avid surfer, partnered with junior Chantae Reden for the mtvU special. Reden is an accomplished surfer and snowboarder who plans on training for a triathlon, while McMains looks to improve his overall fitness.
“I decided to participate in Student Bodies because I wanted to take my fitness to the next level,” said McMains. “Fitness is really important to a fit mind.”
This week, the team met main trainer Gunnar Peterson, celebrity trainer to Tom Brady, Kim Kardashian, Matthew McConaughey and Gatorade G-Series trainer Amy Dixon. The show, which is sponsored in part by Gatorade, focused mainly on introducing the competitors and the fitness evaluation.
The teams performed a variety of exercises focusing on four categories: strength, speed, power and endurance. Competitors performed each exercise sequentially for the time trial, ending in a one-mile run. The results will be challenged at the end of the season to see how far each team has progressed. In this baseline evaluation, USC lost to UCLA, completing their trial in 24:21 while UCLA finished in 23:31.
“In the mile, I sort of died,” said Reden.
Hopefully, next week’s episode will be kinder to USC. All competitors clearly have their work cut out for them in Student Bodies.
“It’s important to win because we’re representing USC, and it’s a matter of pride to outdo UCLA in everything possible,” commented McMains.

Though many parents might advise their children to not eat too much candy, the Food and Drug Administration this year warns candy-loving grown-ups to lay off black licorice.
In a statement the FDA preaches moderation of the treat in adults over the age of 40 because eating more than two ounces of black licorice per day for two weeks can lead to overdose and send some adults to the hospital with heart problems.
According to CBS, black licorice contains the sweetening compound glycyrrhizin. This substance can cause the body’s potassium levels to plummet, leading to an irregular heart rhythm, high blood pressure or even heart failure. The FDA sets limitations on how much glycyrrhizin can be used in food products, but individuals who eat multiple servings cause increases in the intake of the compound.
Though often used as a natural remedy for sore throats and heartburn, black licorice can interact badly with some medications and supplements. It can interfere with estrogen hormone pills, diuretics and some steroids according to the National Institute of Health. The institution also reported those with heart disease or kidney disease are more susceptible to effects, in which as few as five grams of black licorice a day could cause health problems.
So on the biggest candy-eating holiday of the year, make sure to practice moderation while snacking on the old-fashioned treat.
[…] of you who are still imbibing on the chemical high, enjoy it while you can. But, try not to eat any black licorice. Evidently, that can kill […]

Women have only been officers in the U.S. Army since the 1940s, but the female cadets in the USC Trojan Battalion Army Reserve Office Training Corp, which consists of UC Irvine’s, CSU Long Beach’s and CSU Dominguez Hills’ ROTC programs, say differences between men and women in the army have become less prevalent.
In the USC Army ROTC Company there are only four female cadets out of a total of 30, but their presence is strong.
“We are one army; we aren’t separate,” said MS4 cadet Hannah Stryker, a graduate student studying social work. “It is so important for women to feel like soldiers.”
Stryker said she learned all she knows from a previous drill sergeant who taught her how to be successful as a woman in the army.
“Drill Sgt. Trada was really hard on us but she really showed us all the ropes and she expected us to excel and to be as good or better than any of our male counterparts,” Stryker said. “As a result we learned to do a lot of things, we have to do it differently, but we are just as good or just as capable and just as competent as anyone else here.”

The Army Physical Fitness Test is different for men and women in the ROTC program, but most other obstacles and tests are exactly the same. Stryker said the differences in the test just means the females must learn to adapt according to their body types and physical differences.
At USC Army ROTC’s fall training exercise at Camp San Luis Obispo, female cadets are able to complete the obstacles on the confidence training course, only in a different manner than their male counterparts.
“The guys try to tell the female cadets how to get up these obstacles and it won’t work for them, so seeing them struggle with it and having gone through this obstacle, going back and being able to show them the way I was taught, that’s the only way that they are going to be able to learn,” Stryker said. “It is seeing other women be able to get up there and do it.”
Just as Stryker learned from women before her, the younger cadets look up to Stryker and follow her example.
“When I see Stryker I think, wow, I can do that,”  said MS1 cadet Faith Duyan, a freshman in the Trojan Battalion from CSU Dominguez Hills. “They’ve done so much and gotten so far. I want to be like them. They are motivating for me.”
Other female cadets said despite the physical differences, life in the army is relatively the same for male and female cadets.
“It’s the minor things that set us apart, the fact that we have lower standards for push-ups,” said MS1 cadet Julianna La Luzerne, a freshman majoring in political science. “But I don’t think any of the cadets see that as a burden. What matters most is leadership and being a woman has nothing to do with [that].”
The U.S. military is still in the process of accommodating the increasing presence of women, but ROTC students at USC are hopeful that one day gender differences will cease to matter.
“We are all soldiers, we wear the same uniform,” said MS3 cadet Rosanne Truong, a junior at CSU Dominguez Hills. “Hopefully we can get over our differences; as long as there is mutual respect, we will be fine.”
At the end of the day, the most important thing is that all cadets learn how to work together, according to Laura Morales, an MS4 cadet in the Trojan Battalion.
“Never has my gender made me feel less than [anyone], never, not once,” Morales said. “That is part of the reason why males and females get along so well in the army now. We are the same.”
No, fratboy, that would make you a hungry person.  If you felt you were composed of two pieces of bread and some meat, though…
But seriously, I have great respect for anyone who chooses to join the military, whatever gender.  In my traditionally male-dominated field, we learned decades ago that diversity in a team just makes it that much more versatile, and I hope that is a lesson the military has learned as well.  Fight on, cadets, and stay safe.
I “feel” hungry, that doesn’t make me a sandwich

Knott’s 39th annual Halloween Haunt is at once chilling and exciting.
Tonight marks the final night of the horror park, which includes 13 mazes, seven shows and loads of scary monsters, ghouls, ghosts, goblins and gremlins roaming around the park scaring Haunt goers.
This year’s Haunt added three new mazes to the bunch (Invasion, Endgames and Delirium) as well as one new fright zone (Gypsy Camp) that are sure to make your toes curl, teeth chatter and blood curdle.
On the top of my list this year was the new Delirium maze; the flashing lights, hazy atmosphere, pulsing music and menacing monsters had me jumping at every turn.
Happy Haunting!
The Best:
Virus Z (Fiesta Plaza) – A small village infested with cannibals, zombies and vicious corpses
Delirium (Ghostrider warehouse) – A wilderness of terrifying lunacy
Doll Factory (Wilderness Dance Hall) – A psychotic murderer goes on a killing-spree, displaying his mutilated patients in a museum for all to see
Terror of London (Mystery Lodge) – Features infamous characters Dr. Jekyll and Jack the Ripper
The Worst:
Corn Stalkers (Butterfield Stagecoach trail) – Scarecrows and manic farmers roam putrid cornfields
Lockdown: The Asylum (Near Ghostrider) – A highly secure prison of insane inmates
The Rest:
Fallout Shelter (Reflection Lake) – Eccentric residents live in a world of darkness
Dia de los Muertos in 3-D (bumper cars) – A “Day of the Dead” themed setting with plenty of skulls, religious paraphernalia and the walking dead
Sleepy Hollow (Timber Mountain log ride) – The infamous headless horseman, witches, goblins, ghosts and ghouls cause terror in a cave like setting
Uncle Bobo’s Big Top of the Bizarre in 3-D (Xcelerator) – Evil clowns run rampant in a circus-thriller from hell
Invasion Beneath (Calico Mine Ride) – Creatures from the core of the Earth emerge to fight the surface world in a military battle
The Slaughterhouse (Main gate) – A nutty butcher serves up body-part-BBQ at his restaurant
End Games: Warriors of the Apocalypse (Camp Snoopy, former Peanuts Playhouse) – Gladiators fight to the death in a post-apocalyptic setting

The United Nations Population Division declared Oct. 31 as the day that the world’s population bumped up to 7 billion, adding to the exponential growth that added 1 billion people in just the last 12 years.
Although population scientists will never know when the exact date of the 7 billionth baby will be born, the UN declared Oct. 31 as the symbolic date. The UN said today’s calculation comes with about a 1-2 percent margin of error – which means the population could be about 56 million people higher or lower.
Regardless, the world’s population is expected to grower at an even faster pace in the future, reaching up to 10 billion by the end of the century.
Most of the growth is expected in developing countries in Asia, Latin America and Africa.
In America, the growth rate has remained relatively flat at about 1.8 percent a year. Because the birth rate in the United States is at population replacement levels of about two children per mother, the increase is mainly attributed to high immigration.
