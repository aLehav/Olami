Entertainment and technology innovators gathered in the Ronald Tutor Campus Center Ballroom on Wednesday for the second annual Silicon Beach @ USC, a competition and conference on technology and innovation.
The two-day Silicon Beach @ USC was hosted by four professional schools at USC: the Marshall School of Business, the School of Cinematic Arts, the Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism, and the Viterbi School of Engineering.
David Belasco, an MBA professor in the Marshall School, opened the event with a telling statement.
“Silicon Beach and USC should always be mentioned in the same sentence,” Belasco said.
The term used to describe the technology and entertainment ecosystem envisioned for Southern California, such as the already established Silicon Valley in Northern California.
“[The Institute for Communication Technology Management] was interested in doing an event that focused on the future of technology and was something that would be of benefit to students and the larger community,” said Jay Tucker, chief marketing director for Marshall and interim director of CTM.
“We were able to partner with the [Lloyd] Greif Center for Entrepreneurship on what we thought was a special opportunity to combine the venture competition and a conference as one experience.”
The two groups came up with Silicon Beach @ USC, which has started the cultivation of innovation and talent on and off campus. This year, student attendance nearly doubled from last year.
The day started with a presentation by Gerard Tellis, a Marshall professor and director of the USC Center for Global Innovation, on the secret to staying on top: unrelenting motivation.
The presentation was  followed by a series of panels covering topics ranging from start-ups to Hollywood. The first panel was led by Viterbi faculty member Ashish Soni, the founder of Viterbi Students Institute for Innovation and Viterbi Startup Garage. Soni’s programs are working to create the kind of ecosystem in which Viterbi students can make their ideas into reality.
Councilman Curren Price, who represents the area in which the University Park campus is situated, also attended the event, something the hosts of the program were happy about.
“Having our policy makers, our councilman, our state assemblymen, this sends the message that this is important to the city of L.A., but the thing that I really prize the most is the response from the USC and the Trojan community,” Tucker said.
The second panel dealt with the impact of mobility.
“This is not a tweet-free zone,” Ken Williams, executive director and CEO of the Entertainment Technology Center of USC     Cinematic Arts, said jokingly.
Director of Annenberg’s    Program on Online Communites, Karen North, also spoke on the panel.
“Mobile put all of us in the real time world. Things are happening, and we are either here, reacting, participating in the moment … That is the game changer,” North said.
The main topics of the mobility panel were immediacy, commentary on mobile being both a conduit for the virtual and physical and public policy.
“There’s always going to be a lag between what people are actually doing and what the law says they should do,” said David Anderson of Edwards Wildman Palmer LLP, a premier law firm that will provide legal services for winners of the Silicon Beach @ USC competition.
In the afternoon, Albert Cheng, the executive vice president and chief product officer at Disney/ABC held a “fireside chat.” Cheng noted that problems with constraints on both the market and people keep us from knowing what the future will look like. Despite this, Cheng attempted to forecast changes.
“The next wave is going to be less sexy, because it’s going to be focused on things the consumers can’t see,” he said. “The success of the business relies on good storytelling, period. How you get there changes a lot.”
In the afternoon, awards were presented to the contest winners. Sixty-two entrants in the fields of the technology, digital media and entertainment submitted their applications on Sept. 2. Forty-nine teams were invited to present on Sept. 10. On Sept. 17, 16 judges saw the top eight present. Each were given five minutes for presentation and five minutes for Q&A.
The $25,000 first place prize went to SellBot, a company created by brothers and USC graduates Michael and Payam Ahdoot. The technology is an e-commerce platform.
The $15,000 second place prize went to iScout. Creators Andrew Abramson, Brandon Ballew, Vincent Tsang and Andrew Costa pitched their idea as “moneyball for football.” iScout also received the “Disruptor” award from the Lloyd Greif Center for Entrepreneurial Studies.
Jill Bigelow, a USC MBA grad took home the $10,000 third place prize for her company, Pelv-ice. Pelv-ice helps those recovering from pelvic trauma.

Approximately 30 students met with Interim General Manager of the City of Los Angeles’ Economic Development Department and USC alumna Jan Perry at Lunch with a Leader, an event hosted by the USC Price School of Public Policy’s Bedrosian Center on Governance at the Widney Alumni House on Wednesday.
Experience talks · Jan Perry talks about governance, policy and leadership during a luncheon with students at the Bedrosian Center. – Ralf Cheung | Daily Trojan
The luncheons, which will continue throughout the semester, are intended to foster an intimate dialogue between students and notable individuals in governance, policy and leadership.
Perry started the conversation by sharing her personal story. Born and raised in Ohio, Perry got a taste of politics from her parents. Her father, a World War II veteran, was the first person of color to be elected mayor of Woodmere since the days of Reconstruction. Her mother also served as mayor of Woodmere and is still involved in politics today. Perry said political policy was common dinnertime discussion in her household.
After college, Perry worked for some time in the private sector, but said it didn’t make her feel fulfilled. When an opportunity to work in public service opened up, she jumped at the chance and has been involved in politics ever since.
Perry, who has served as a three-term member of the City Council for District 9, has a reputation for getting things done. When asked how she has been able to implement changes, such as getting projects built in South Central Los Angeles and infusing money into Downtown Los Angeles, Perry said it all comes down to building relationships.
“By having relationships with people, I get to see what kind of public policy I actually need to develop because I see it playing out right in front of me,” Perry said. “It also keeps me grounded because I know what people want outside the walls of City Hall … the time I spend outside in the community actually getting things built.”
She learned this mentality by walking up to people on their porch, a common practice in Ohio.
“Once, one woman said, ‘No you’re not Jan Perry, that girl’s pretty,’” Perry said, to laughter. “But that was pretty telling because she wasn’t used to people coming to her door. That’s got to change. You can help change that.”
Brittany Mello, a first year graduate student studying public administration, was especially taken by Perry’s call to action.
“I’m trying to figure out how to be a leader and hearing her talk about her over a decade of public service and focus on being connected to the people that you’re serving and going door to door … I think that’s a powerful message of what to focus your energy on to make a difference,” Mello said.
Perry also spoke about term limits, a topic she personally has been affected by, as she reached her limit as a city council member in July.
“I got a lot done as councilor, and there was a lot I didn’t get done,” Perry said. “When you think about the consequences of governing of term limits … it hits disadvantaged communities much harder because they don’t have advocates to follow through with projects that are proposed during a term that are then discarded.”
Perry did not, however, seem to be concerned about voter apathy among young people, a point that many sitting around the table asked her about.
“I have an enormous amount of hope for the next generation because they actually are very well-informed, and technology has allowed them to be much more connected,” Perry said.
An issue she does feel must be addressed more is homelessness.
“People who have long-term issues, bipolar disorders, schizophrenia — that’s why they’re homeless. There will always be people in our society who are frail, who are old, and we must build to care for those people,” Perry said. “In my opinion, it’s the wrong thing to do to condemn them to being on [the] sidewalk.”
Anastasia Tarpeh, a second year graduate student in public policy and the president of Women Leading Public Policy and Development, said she felt inspired by Perry’s talk.
“What she said regarding young people today, follow[ing] passions, not simply find[ing] a career and stick[ing] with it. Hearing that from her, it wasn’t a call to action, but it was a realization to keep thinking about those dreams, keep thinking about those communities we can impact, and I feel that resonated with everyone here today,” she said.
At the end of the conversation, Perry reiterated her thoughts on what it takes to be a leader and a successful public servant.
“It’s important to stay close to the people you represent, it’s important to master your craft. I think that you have to have a willingness to fight, if you believe in what you’re doing … and fulfill your commitments,” she said. “A lot of people promise things and then it never happens — we can change that.”

The USC Dornsife College of Letters, Arts and Sciences’ Levan Institute for Humanities and Ethics hosted a Coffeehouse Conversation, a series of talks in which faculty and students discuss ethical questions, at Ground Zero Performance Cafe Wednesday afternoon.
Crisis looming · Ph. D candidate in political science and international relations Matthew Gratias discusses government’s place in democracy. – Chris Roman | Daily Trojan
Lyn Boyd-Judson, an organizer for the event, said the idea for Coffeehouse Conversations formed six years ago when she and Sharon Lloyd, a professor of philosophy, discussed taking a small group of philosophy students and having the Levan Institute institutionalize the program as a larger interdisciplinary effort.
Lloyd has organized all of the Coffeehouse Conversations since then.
“I think the Coffeehouse  Conversations are a great addition to our campus dialogue, and we feel fortunate enough to be in a position to make that happen,” Boyd-Judson said.
Wednesday’s discussion, entitled “Democratic Transparency and State Secrets: A Question of Values,” involved Edward Snowden’s leaked details about American and British mass government surveillance.
Snowden, a former CIA and NSA employee, revealed highly confidential information to the press in May 2013. The media and the public have given him various titles, ranging from “hero” to “traitor,” and his actions are still a topic of controversy.
The Levan conversation, however, did not focus entirely on Snowden and his actions. Instead, panelists mainly drove the discussion by expressing their personal thoughts on surveillance and its role in the American government.
The panel members came from a variety of backgrounds, including a former NSA contractor and appointee of the Obama administration.
The panelists were Tiffany Chang, a doctoral candidate in philosophy; John Dreher, a philosophy professor at Dornsife; Matthew Gratias, a former NSA contractor and current doctoral candidate; Ari Ratner, a fellow at the Truman National Security Project and former appointee at the Department of State; Michael Shapiro, a professor at the USC Gould School of Law and Kevin Starr, a history professor at Dornsife. Lloyd moderated the discussion.
Chang explored the concept of political discourse and why it is important to the flourishing of a democracy.
“[Communication] enables us to be more responsible citizens, to be informed about the decisions we make as citizens, about policies that affect not just us but others as well,” Chang said. “So the important question that I encourage you to think about today is, ‘What if secret surveillance has an undermining effect on political discourse, and why the ordinary citizen in a democratic society should be concerned?’”
Several members of the panel discussed the thin line between security and privacy.
“You have to agree to some degree of surveillance,” Shapiro said. “There are things you have to give up for security, and that is autonomy, privacy, confidentiality, transparency — all different concepts.”
Shapiro even referenced recent attacks on the nation and citizens’ reactions to the events.
“Something happened in Washington yesterday, and people start saying, ‘Why didn’t they see it coming?’” Shapiro said. “But if you start specifying what operation you use to perform in order to make sure you see it coming, the same people who said, ‘Why didn’t they see it coming?’ are going to start objecting.”
Many students appreciated the variety of speakers selected for the discussion.
“They had very qualified speakers. I especially appreciated Ratner and Gratias because they seemed to have the most physical firsthand connection with the issue,” Andrew Schmidt, a sophomore majoring in philosophy, politics and law, said. “[The panelists] seemed relatively stable in their view that some surveillance regardless of your direct consent was necessary … I’d like to see a panel composed of vigorously anti-government, anti-NSA types because you’d get a very different account.”
Several of the students who attended found that though the discussion was enlightening, their own opinions of Snowden’s actions and controversy surrounding government surveillance remained unchanged.
“My main thought after this is I don’t really have a problem with any type of security, any type of data watching,” Reed Foster, a senior majoring in philosophy, politics and law, said. “I never have, and I think that if the government wants to track my behavior down to the tee, as long as they don’t interfere with my personal life, I don’t really care. They can do whatever they want.”
Others, such as Arjun Ahuja, a sophomore majoring in philosophy, politics and law, voiced a different opinion on government surveillance based on personal experience.
“I think it comes from my background as a Sikh American, with someone who wears a turban and a beard. I think the potential for abuse with surveillance systems, especially when it’s being used now to specifically target potential terrorists, is a huge problem,” Ahuja said. “Because surveillance now has a specific purpose, the tendency to profile has really increased. That is my biggest problem with it. Giving up one’s personal liberties for the sake of security is completely unreasonable.”

On Wednesday afternoon, the USC Jesse M. Unruh Institute of Politics in partnership with the Schwarzenegger Institute held its second Students Talk Back of the semester. The weekly forums allow students to engage in discussion about a political issue.
This week, experts discussed policies on hydraulic fracturing, or “fracking,” the process of using high-pressure water to fracture rocks, extracting from the shale reserves underneath. The debate-like format of the discussion allowed for investigation into the issue.
The event panel consisted of students Kelsey Harrison, a senior majoring in political science, and Jake Jordan, a senior majoring in international relations (global business) and professionals Dave Quast, the California Director of Energy in Depth, a pro-petroleum think tank, and Brenna Norton, the Southern California Operator from Food & Water Watch, an anti-fracking advocate. Daniel Rothberg, an editor at the Daily Trojan, and Dan Schnur, director of the USC Jesse M. Unruh Institute of Politics, co-moderated the debate.
Before the event, Ivan Kumamoto, a sophomore majoring in business administration, shared why he attended the forum.
“I expect to find out more about recent developments in the natural gas industry and if … environmental concerns [have] changed at all.”
The debate was not without tension.
“Hopefully, we have a legitimate level of intellectual honesty. Because a lot of the discussion on [the oil industry’s] side of the debate has, in my opinion, been false or preposterous,” Kumamoto said after learning of Quast’s affiliation with Energy in Depth.
Both sides were asked to define fracking before launching into the debate.
“I know what the oil and gas industry tells what fracking is. But, in the bigger picture, fracking has come to mean the whole process, the trucking in of thousand gallons of water, all the sand they have to move to extract from that well, all the waste water that comes up from the process, radioactive material that comes up from fracking,” Norton said.
Quast defined fracking as “the injection of fluid at depth.”
“It takes place in a heavily regulated environment in the state level. Hydraulic fracturing is not a new thing. It has been going on since the Truman administration,” he said.
Norton’s main points included environmental concerns at increased oil production, lack of regulation and contamination. She was in favor of a ban on fracking all together.
Harrison presented a study that she had helped to conduct. According to the study by USC and the Los Angeles Times, 41 percent of L.A. Democrats and 43 percent of Republicans were in favor of regulated fracking, and 14 percent were in favor of all forms of fracking.
Quast held that a ban on fracking would disrupt economies and harm the industry. He also held that fracking, as a process, is safe.
“There’s never been a single case of water contamination,” Quast said.
Alec White, a sophomore majoring political science, found the event insightful.
“I found most interesting that fracking will not contribute to the cost of gasoline at all. That puts me on the side against fracking,” White said.

So Alec says he’s against fracking because fracking won’t lead to an increase in the cost of gasoline.  What’s with that?
I suggest a course for Alex in basic economics.
What’s the debate?
America can benefit handsomely through energy independence.
America suffers from being dependent on foreign energy.
There ain’t much else, is there?
Fight On!

Despite USC’s well-documented struggles on the offensive side of the ball early this season, the Trojans’ main concern this week could be on defense as they prepare to play Utah State (2-1) this Saturday at the Los Angeles Coliseum.
It is no secret that the Aggies have a lethal weapon in senior quarterback Chuckie Keeton. The Trojans’ defense is up for a challenge, hoping to contain the dual-threat quarterback who’s led an offense averaging 49.3 points and 550.3 yards/game.
It all starts with Keeton, a three-year starter at Utah State who began his collegiate career in 2011 with a near upset over the defending BCS champions, as the Aggies came close to knocking off Auburn on the road before falling valiantly 42-38.
Since then, Keeton has racked up 5,496 passing yards, 1,099 rushing yards and 64 total touchdowns.
This season, he’s thrown 12 touchdowns, tied for first in the nation, and just one interception while compiling a stunning QB rating of 187.7. He also leads the team in rushing, totaling  187 yards on 28 carries (6.7 yards per carry).
Keeton is such a prolific dual-threat quarterback that Kiffin compared him to Seattle Seahawks quarterback Russell Wilson earlier this week.
Keeton is protected by a veteran cast in his offensive line, which boasts five returning starters and has allowed only three sacks so far this year.
The Aggies play an uptempo, no-huddle offensive scheme that has caused major headaches for their opponents so far this season.
The offense ranks eighth in the nation in points per game and 12th in yards per game despite losing its top three receivers from last season.
“I would describe their offense as explosive,” said Kiffin. “This is a really good team with a great quarterback, great offense, defense and special teams.”
The USC defense, however, has a couple of lethal weapons of their own.
Despite recording just one sack and no turnovers last week against Boston College, the Trojans are still tied for second in the nation in sacks (12) and are tied for sixth in interceptions (6).
USC is also in the national Top 10 in rushing defense, total defense, pass efficiency defense, tackles for loss and scoring defense.
Redshirt senior defensive end and team captain Devon Kennard says this week is the hardest the team has practiced in the four seasons he has played for USC.
To prepare for Keeton, the Trojan defense has been playing against redshirt freshman quarterback Conner Sullivan during practice. Sullivan, who also plays baseball at USC and has some speed of his own, is the closest the Trojans can get to imitating Keeton.
“We know we can’t let [Keeton] out of the pocket a lot and run all over us,” said Kennard.
With such a dynamic quarterback commanding the opposition, defensive coordinator Clancy Pendergast says that his defense is focused on switching gears from utilizing a heavy run-oriented gap protection strategy to adjust to the Aggies’ more spread out offense.
“They do a lot of different things offensively. [They use] multiple personnel groups, multiple formations and multiple plays,” Pendergast said.
The Trojans’ defense will have to make adjustments to the 5-2 defensive scheme that Pendergast put in place.
“That’s the challenge of coaching college football and in the Pac-12 because you see a different offense every week,” Pendergast said.
By the response of the players and the long list of accolades USC’s defense has acquired over the first few weeks of the season (second in rushing defense, fourth in total defense), it is clear that Pendergast has lived up to the challenge thus far — but the Trojans are striving to get even better.
Redshirt junior cornerback Josh Shaw said the defense is aiming to be the top-ranked unit in the country.
“We come out and prepare as if [we are number one] every single day,” said Shaw. “We don’t want to be second to anyone.”
Redshirt junior safety Dion Bailey echoed his sentiments.
“If we’re all playing well and we’re the top defense in the country, we will all be looked at as the best players in our respective positions just like the Alabamas and LSUs,” Bailey said. “We just have to show up and do what Coach P. wants us to do.”
Saturday will be the true test. The last four times the Trojans played the Aggies, they have outscored them by a total of 213-29, but Utah State has won 18 of its last 22 games.

The USC women’s soccer team looks to build off a big win as they prepare to continue their homestand and wrap up nonconference play against Florida Atlantic on Thursday and Cal State Fullerton on Sunday.
Open pitch · Freshman Kayla Mills has provided a spark on offense in her first year at Troy, and leads USC in points (11) and assists (5). – Nick Entin | Daily Trojan
The Women of Troy (4-2-1) ended a three-game losing streak on Sunday with a decisive 5-1 win over Loyola Marymount. After only scoring one goal during the streak, USC erupted for five goals in the first half and four in the first 19 minutes to set a season-high for goals scored. Sophomore forward Katie Johnson finished with a hat trick after 19 minutes of play, with senior forward Elizabeth Eddy and senior midfielder Jordan Marada accounting for the other two goals. Junior goalkeeper Caroline Stanley earned 5 saves before being substituted with about 15 minutes left to play.
“I think in our game against LMU it was the first time that you could see we were hungry to score goals,” junior forward Jessica Musmanno said. “That’s the type of mentality we want to continue throughout the rest of our season, just doing the little things right where we were unlucky before. Hopefully the streak keeps going.”
Despite the big win over LMU, the Women of Troy dropped out of the NCAA rankings, but are still receiving votes. They entered the weekend ranked No. 23, and have been ranked as high as No. 17 this season.
USC is outscoring opponents 18-8 on the year, with Eddy leading the team with five goals. Freshman forward Kayla Mills leads the team in points (11) and assists (5), while Stanley has a .800 save percentage and 0.86 goals against average (GAA) on the season.
“Our focus is still on sharpening some of the errors we’ve made defensively that have led to goals,” coach Ali Khosroshahin said. “We create and finish opportunities for ourselves, and being able to do things a little faster, a little quicker, a bit more pressure. The team seems to be responding.”
FAU (2-4-1) is coming off a blowout in their last game, a 10-0 rout over Arkansas-Pine Bluff (1-7-0) on Sunday. The team finished with a school-record 40 shots (22 on goal), with midfielder Claire Emslie recording a hat trick and an assist. It was the Owls’ second straight win of the season, after being outscored 8-2 during a five-game winless streak to start the season.
It will be the first time that USC has played Florida Atlantic in the program’s history.
Esmlie’s three goals and seven points lead the team, while Taylor Sorrels and Julie Taylor have two goals each. Courtney Zwetsch has a save percentage of .750 in 9 games, with a GAA of 1.25.
“We can’t really worry about them,” Musmanno said. “We just have to be confident and shut down our defending. I think right now our defenders have been doing really well, so I have faith in our backline that they’re not going to get scored on 10 times [like Arkansas-Pine Bluff].”
Cal State Fullerton’s (3-2-2) last contest resulted in a 0-0 tie against Utah State (4-1-2). They outshot the Aggies 17-12 during the contest, but committed a staggering 27 fouls to Utah State’s 10.
USC last played Cal State Fullerton in the 2012 season opener, winning the game 3-2 on the road despite having one defender sent off with a red card. Marada had a goal and an assist in the contest.
Christina Burkenroad leads the Titans with three points on the year, while Lindsey Maricic has an .882 save percentage and 0.62 GAA on the year. The team has a more defensive mindset, outscoring opponents 5-4 and recording five shutouts on the season.
Both games kick off at 3 p.m. at McAlister Field, with USC facing off against the Owls on Thursday before taking on the Titans on Sunday. After this weekend, the team will head on the road to start conference play.

The name of this column is “Any Given Saturday,” a collegiate play on the great NFL movie Any Given Sunday with Al Pacino. It’s about the beauty of college sports and sports in general — in college football, on any given Saturday, something special might happen. For three Saturdays in a row here at USC, we’ve had something special happen: a home football game.
But wait, how is that special? Half the games are home games. That’s six or seven a year.
But that’s exactly why they are special. Think about it: in your four years here at USC, you will spend somewhere around 1,000 days on this campus. Of those, perhaps 25 will be gamedays.
I wrote a bit about this is my first column of the year, but there is really nothing like gameday here on this campus. I have experienced 21 of them in my time here, and they are probably the 21 best days of my college experience (only a slight exaggeration). This weekend will be number 22, meaning I’ll have just four left.
Believe me, I understand how draining and all-encompassing gameday tends to be. It seems wrong to call it a “waste” of a day, but in certain respects that’s exactly what it is, because if you’re doing it right you’re certainly not getting anything else done. And I get how rough it is to have three of them in a row, especially with three less-than-ideal kickoff times, to say the least.
But gameday is gameday. I like sleep just as much as any other 21-year-old male (ask my girlfriend, she’ll tell you). Gameday, however, is a different story. Why? Because it’s gameday. To have three in a row is not a chore, but a treat. After this Saturday, there won’t be a true gameday here for five weeks, and that’s the only one for almost two months. You get Saturday, Oct. 26 against Utah and that’s it until mid-November.
There is of course the much-anticipated Thursday, Oct. 10 matchup against Arizona. I could not be more excited for that game. If there is a single student in an afternoon class that day I will be supremely disappointed. But even I admit that it will not be the same. And though I expect many of the “restrictions” (like no on-campus tailgating) to be largely ignored, the day inevitably will not have the same festive nature of a Saturday in the fall.
I work at most games now, usually starting three hours before kickoff. As you can imagine, this is a severe detriment to my tailgating experience, in part because of the time but mainly because of my necessary sobriety. Sure, I always pass through McCarthy Quad, say hi to friends, maybe even have a burger if there’s time. And I always, always kick the flagpole. But it’s not the same, and I miss that experience dearly.
So cherish these days. Gamedays are as much a social event as they are an actual game. Sometimes I get upset because people seem to care more about socializing than football, but that is in part because I am a sports nerd and a curmudgeon to boot, so the combination is very conducive to that. But that doesn’t make the pregame festivities any less amazing.
If you have a moment this Saturday, go stand on top of the steps at the southeastern corner of VKC. Look out at McCarthy Quad to your left, Alumni Park to your right, and I guarantee you will smile. If you do this, chances are it will be before 10 a.m. That’s pretty early for a Saturday in college.
But this isn’t just any given Saturday. This is gameday.

Coming into the season, it was expected that USC’s run game would feature a dominant running back. Three games in and it appears that expectations have been met, if not surpassed.
Out in the open · Redshirt sophomore tailback Tre Madden was declared the full-time starter at tailback on USC’s depth chart this week for the first time after running for 100 yards in each of the Trojans’ first three games. – William Ehart | Daily Trojan
 
The only surprise is that the running back is not senior Silas Redd, whose injured knee has prevented him from playing.
Instead, redshirt sophomore Tre Madden has picked up the slack, acting as a reliable power back for USC in the early portion of the season.
Madden, who redshirted last year after a season-ending ACL injury in spring practice, has established himself as the team’s starter at tailback. Originally recruited as a linebacker, he has already made a name for himself in Trojan lore, becoming the first running back to open a season with three straight 100 plus rushing yard games since Marcus Allen in 1981.
This impressive start has catapulted Madden into a rarely reached atmosphere, as only six other Trojan running backs have accomplished this feat, four of whom went on to win Heisman trophies.
Even with this auspicious debut, Madden has remained humble, praising his offensive line and fullbacks for putting forth a great blocking effort.
“The guys up front have been doing a great job,” Madden said. “I give all [the credit] to them.”
In addition to the immense potential Madden has flashed on the ground, he has shown his capability as a blocker and receiver out of the backfield. Madden credits this versatility to the wide variety of positions he has played along the way. At Mission Viejo High School, he played quarterback in addition to suiting up as a linebacker as a freshman. Both of these experiences have added dimensions to Madden’s game.
“For vision, reading the safeties and corners, I think [previously playing quarterback] helps out,” Madden said.
His stint at linebacker contributes to his punishing and intelligent running style.
Of his time at linebacker, Madden says it has helped him with “just being physical … and knowing where the linebackers are going to end up.”
As a blocker, Madden credits an increase in football IQ for his improvement.
“Knowing the technique … and where the offensive line is going to slide to. Different things you need to know to be successful,” Madden said.
Only three games into his collegiate career on the offensive side of the ball, Madden’s future looks very bright, and has already drawn praise from an array of admirers, including USC legend Marcus Allen himself.
According to the Los Angeles Times, Allen said Madden is “just sort of scratching the surface of his potential. The more he plays the position the better he’ll get and he’ll realize he can get even more out of himself.”
The lofty praise from the former All-American echoes sentiments from head coach Lane Kiffin, who seems pleased with Madden thus far.
“It’s hard to start much better than he has,” Kiffin said.
In addition to seeking advice from the coaches, Madden talks strategy with his dad who has coached him throughout his life and played college football at Kansas State.
Madden’s physical running style has evoked comparisons to everyone from Allen to Houston Texans running back Arian Foster, whom Madden designates as his favorite running back.
“[Foster] brings a physicality to the game,” Madden said. “He is very determined with his running style and I think I feed off that.”
The running back’s tremendous start has been complemented by the emergence of talented true freshman Justin Davis, whose shifty runs have garnered their own share of attention and praise. Together, the two provide a glimpse of a potent future combination akin to that of Lightning and Thunder with Reggie Bush and LenDale White.
Davis said he looks to the veteran Madden for advice.
“He has been here for three years already… so definitely he helps me out with a lot of tips,” Davis said. “I have to make sure when I get back on the field that I match his intensity.”
As Madden looks to continue to punish would-be tacklers on the gridiron, Kiffin might find himself in quite the predicament in the upcoming weeks. When Silas Redd returns from his injury, there will be a crowded backfield with a bevy of talented backs looking for touches.
Madden said he hopes to do what is best for the team, even if it means possibly sharing carries.
“We have great running backs and getting fresh legs on all the carries is definitely more beneficial to this team,” Madden said.
That’s probably true — but it wouldn’t hurt to keep giving Madden the ball as much as possible.

Every other day, it seems, we open the newspaper to read about the ways in which the Internet is affecting businesses and altering industries. Yet one enterprise that’s been largely left untouched are the companies that sell the combination mustache-glasses disguise. You know the ones — bushy eyebrows atop black frames. They’re the kind of trinket you might find at, say, your dentist’s paper treasure chest or in a third grader’s party favor bag.
Though I can’t say for sure, I would imagine the advent of the Internet hasn’t exactly been a boon for the makers of said disguise. On the face of it, the two seem unrelated enough. One is a throwaway, probably “Made in China,” gimmick that never quite fit my face right. The other is, well, the Internet, which fits my face a little better, especially when I use a filter. Seemingly different, the two are related, albeit tenuously.
It comes down to identity. The waiting room glasses represent a cursory means for changing your identity. The Internet has offered a new ability to change your identity that makes the glasses look irrelevent and certainly even more cursory.
Like those creepy (but effective) commercials show, you don’t have to change your physical experience to steal one’s identity. You don’t even have to leave your computer. It all can be done with a simple click (OK, it’s probably more likely that it would take a few clicks but you get the point).
As I mentioned in an earlier column, I discovered that my virtual identity had been co-opted when I searched my name (yes, you can make fun of me) on Twitter to look for a tweet. When I searched for my handle @danielrothberg, it was interesting to find that someone had the same handle but with an underscore tacked onto the end — theirs was @danielrothberg_. What was more interesting, however, was that the imposter handle had the same avatar I’d been using for my real account.
Forgetting why I’d ever searched for myself to begin with, I clicked on the phony account. It also had my cover photo and more alarmingly my biography. In fact, at a glance, it was almost impossible to tell them apart — but then you read the tweets.
The content on my actual Twitter account primarily consists of interesting news stories and the occasional humorous quote. But my imposter account was a different story.
From time to time, according to my fake Twitter, I “look at myself in the mirror and randomly start twerking #isthatweird.” Perhaps weirder than my desire to wake up like Miley is that on June 12, I apparently wanted to “sneak into the church nursery and eat all the cookies #PastoralConfessions.” Did I mention that I got tickets to the Jesse McCartney and Backstreet Boys concert? Front row!
This is a form of identity theft in the 21st century.
Eventually, I was able to report the imposter account. Twitter required I use a fax machine, which is something I don’t have and don’t know many people who do. It’s never occurred to me that I would need a fax machine. Not owning one seems more of a 20th-century fear, in my opinion. But I digress.
I found a fax machine a few weeks later and my first experience of identity theft, as trivial as it was, was over.
I’m acutely aware that my incident was a very minor one compared to those who have had their credit card numbers, social security number, or medical insurance information stolen. These financial crimes are, in almost every case, more damaging than a fake social media account.
But, in every case, identity theft requires no tacky mustache-eyeglass disguise. To a certain extent, that’s been true forever. You could still claim to be someone else, using a stolen credit card or social security number. Yet, with the added benefit of hiding behind the computer screen, it’s true today to a greater degree than ever before.
The problem is widespread. According to the U.S. Department of Justice and Javelin Strategy & Research, more than 11.5 million Americans are victims of identity fraud annually.
So it’s important to take steps to curb identity theft on the Internet.
And I’m not talking just about of more serious cases of ensuring stores requiring a photo ID at every purchase. For the prevention of financial identity theft, the Federal Trade Commission recommends reading bank statements often, knowing when they are due and shredding sensitive documents.
It’s perhaps a bit more difficult to actively take preventative measures to protect your personal identity when it comes to fake accounts and on social networks. But as much as I hate to say it, in this case, a vanity search might go a long way.

Michael Ourieff opened his first company, Michael J’s Boston Pizzeria, in Sherman Oaks in 1983. After multiple menu expansions, Ourieff began a catering company. He eventually moved his business to the bottom floor of — wait for it — the Health Research Building of USC Medical Center. But after some time he decided to open a restaurant. That restaurant was 643 North, an Italian-style eatery off Spring Street in Chinatown that opened its doors earlier this month.

It might seem strange to have an Italian restaurant in Chinatown, where one would expect to find big lobster dinners, dim sum and takeout. But what seems like a mix-up of two totally different cultures actually lends itself to a small L.A. history lesson: What is known to Angelenos today as Chinatown was actually Little Italy in the 1920s and 1930s, so 643 North’s location is a little more fitting than one might think.
To begin work on 643 North, Ourieff collaborated with chef Oz Ramuco, who had years of experience in both the kitchen and working in the downtown neighborhood. Ourieff had a background in Italian food, but more of what he described as “pizzeria style,” and he and Ramuco decided they wanted to do something more upscale with a wine list.
For beverages, 643 North hired Adam Acuff, the man behind the posh Asian fusion concept bar the Far Bar, and designed a bar menu and 643 North’s “build your own martini” bar.
The atmosphere of 643 North is modern and trendy but still cozy, with black and silver furniture with warm wooden accents and a wooden ceiling.
Both Ourieff and Ramuco knew 643 North had the right timing for an Italian eatery, as the genre’s popularity has been growing overall. Nonetheless, Ramuco did not want a pepperoni pizza on the menu — he wanted to “keep it fun, keep it exciting” and “walk away from the stereotypes.” And that’s exactly what they did.
Currently, 643 North only has a lunch and dinner menu, with brunch soon to come. The lunch menu has a slightly smaller selection of salads, soups, paninis, pizzas and main courses such as penne alla vodka and veal ravioli. The dinner menu has a greater selection of dishes and includes a pasta and risotto category.
The dinner menu did not list chicken as an option for the Amazing Greens salad, but the chef was happy to add it. This salad was just the right starter and included mixed greens with baby pear tomatoes, a large garlic crouton and slices of aged parmesan tossed in a citronette dressing.
The pizza menu has a wide array of creative combinations, but the San Daniele pizza was especially delicious. This pizza had a pesto sauce as a base and was topped with fresh tomato, mozzarella, wild arugula, lemon oil, parmesan slices and thin slices of prosciutto piled high. The pizza crust was thick enough to hold all these ingredients, but thin enough to eat several slices easily. It had a rustic oven-baked taste and was perfectly crispy and flaky.
Though people normally come to Italian restaurants for a pizza dish, the 643 Burger came recommended. The burger uses prime Niman ranch beef (to which Ramuco adds premium short rib for a more tender patty) along with a red onion jam, sharp cheddar, honey-mustard glazed bacon and lolla rossa lettuce on a brioche bun. The red onion jam included sweet caramelized onions and was complemented by the dark and slightly bitter lettuce. Oftentimes, hamburgers made on a brioche bun have a lot of bread and not a lot of substance, since the bun is so fluffy and buttery; this time, however, the meat was truly the focal point of this burger. It was cooked as ordered and was definitely a hearty portion. The burger was accompanied by a tower of skinny french fries that were simply impossible to put down.
Dessert included typical favorites such as tiramisu and flourless chocolate cake. Save room for the butter cake, which is a cross between bread pudding and pound cake and is topped with slices of strawberries and a dollop of fresh whipped cream. The warm, sinful cake was easily one of the highlights of the meal.
Ramuco admits that the menu will probably change over time. He and Ourieff want to see what the neighborhood responds to, what the audience demographic is and what dishes prove to be crowd favorites. It is only the beginning of the journey for this new Downtown restaurant, which is spearheading the return of an exciting new culinary scene in L.A.’s Chinatown — including restaurants that are good for more than just takeout.

After a three-year hiatus that recently ended with the September iTunes Music Festival in London, Jack Johnson returns to the music world with his sixth album, From Here to Now to You. Johnson again collaborates with producer Mario Caldato, Jr., who also produced the 2003 album On and On and the popular 2005 album In Between Dreams, to create a sound that seems the equivalent of a calming day at the beach, or perhaps a day of doing nothing at all.
From here to us · Jack Johnson uses the sparse, minimalistic sounds of acoustic guitar in his newest release From Here to Now to You. – Courtesy of bostonherald.com
Essentially, it’s the sound Johnson is most famous for — tracks filled with seldom more than acoustic guitars, drums, bass and, occasionally, piano. And it shouldn’t work for him this well — especially not for six albums — but it does because he executes it so nicely. From Here manages to reach a new level of mellowness derived from his old albums.
This album sound is also vastly different from the moodiness of his last two albums, On and On and To the Sea, which came after the death of his father and cousin, and instead returns to the mellow acoustic sounds of his first album, Brushfire Fairytales, which brought him to the spotlight in 2001.
It’s a sound fans are familiar with; he’s not experimenting with anything this go around, instead just doing what he does best. And with five successful albums already under his belt, it’s apparent that he doesn’t need a new sound.
The album’s first track, “I Got You,” is an ode to the singer’s wife and their marriage. With a catchy rhythm, the song is also easy to sing along to. “I got you / I got everything,” sings Johnson. “I got you / I don’t need anything.” It’s a rather naive and simple view, yes, but it’s a surprisingly endearing one. As with his past albums, much of the inspiration for the 12-song tracklist comes from his personal life. For From Here, the focus is very much on his life with his wife and children — life as a family man.
“This record has been a lot of just sort of being in the family in just kind of my own little bubble,” Johnson told the Associated Press. “Dropping the kids off at school, just day-to-day life, just washing the dishes, working in the garden, taking the trash out.”
One of the album’s tracks is indeed called “Washing Dishes.” The song, however, isn’t simply about a household chore — it delves into a budding love and the daunting thought of tomorrow. “One day is only two words we say,” sings Johnson. “I don’t want to let them get in the way / Of all the plans that we should be making right now.” It’s his ability to take a song about a seemingly commonplace object or an ordinary action — and make the lyrics mean more than the title innocently suggests — which seems to make Johnson so popular with listeners. After all, another one of his most popular songs, off of In Between Dreams, is entitled “Banana Pancakes” and describes having a lazy day doing nothing but, well, making banana pancakes.
“Shot Reverse Shot” is one of the most unique tracks on the album, a song that could be the most popular with listeners. It’s a cheerful song with lyrical breaks relegated to the two-line chorus, “Shot reverse shot / Look what the other got,” and the bridge. Other than that, Johnson doesn’t seem to pause to take a breath.
“Tape Deck” brings fans back to Johnson’s teenage years, creating a band with his friends in his living room. “From my tape deck there’s a recklessness,” sings Johnson, and though that recklessness might have somewhat disappeared between then and now — after all, this was the man who performed on stage in slippers — “Tape Deck” is nonetheless a fun song that takes listeners back to the past.
Ben Harper, who frequently collaborates with Johnson on projects, can be heard in “Change,” a nice, subtle shift to the more upbeat tunes on the album. His blues sound and backing vocals gives the song an interesting edge that complements Johnson’s smooth, soothing voice.
One might think that audiences would at this point be tired of Jack Johnson and his guitar-strumming, happy-go-lucky singing style. But instead, he has released six strong albums of sun-kissed, beachy tunes — songs that make you wish you could just drop everything and transport yourself to the nearest beach to relax and unwind.
And his latest accomplishment, From Here to Now to You, could possibly be the mellowest album Johnson has ever created. Filled with songs dedicated to his loving wife and songs embracing fatherhood, Johnson shows us that he’s at a happy place in life — and that we should try to find that happiness in each of our own lives. His songs won’t work for everyone, but his latest album will definitely satisfy fans and, as a kind of Brushfire Fairytales 2.0, be a good introduction to new listeners.

In a letter, John Adams detailed his thoughts on the Senate’s power to confirm or reject executive nominations to judicial or bureaucratic posts.
“Not a vote or voice would I have given the Senate or any senator unless he were of the privy council,” the future President wrote. “Faction and distraction are the sure and certain consequences of giving to a senate a vote on the distribution of offices.”
In other words, Adams feared the confirmation of presidential nominees would trade off with the Senate’s higher duty of legislating. He also feared it would cause unnecessary political fights to periodically consume half of Capitol Hill. Paradoxically, he was half right — the Senate’s power to confirm appointments to the judiciary is a vital check on executive power. The power to confirm or deny any of the thousand bureaucratic jobs that a new president must fill each term, however, is becoming increasingly less meaningful. As President Barack Obama has found out, the nomination process for bureaucrats has become a moment for Congress to abandon policymaking and create political theater.
Several examples are worth mentioning. In the case of Susan Rice, former Ambassador to the United Nations, Republicans used her potential nomination to succeed Hillary Clinton as Secretary of State as a moment to criticize the Obama administration’s handling of the attacks on the American embassy in Benghazi, Libya. The Washington Post reported that though Rice made several statements on the Sunday talk shows that were later revealed to be misleading about the nature of the attacks, she was merely relying on the intelligence reports she had been provided at the time. Rice’s nomination by the GOP as a pivot for the Benghazi scandal was far disproportionate to the perceived fault of the Obama administration to secure American embassies.
Important to note that Rice ended up withdrawing her name from consideration before she had even been nominated. When some critics in the Senate argued the nomination would be dead on arrival, they begged the question of why members of the Senate were trumpeting political fanfare before their Constitutional number had been called. In reality, nomination debacles such as the Rice conflict reflect poorly on all parties involved, including Obama.
The latter is especially true in the case of Larry Summers, the man who until four days ago many thought to be a clear front-runner to succeed Ben Bernanke as chairman of the Federal Reserve. Like Rice, Summers withdrew his name from consideration after coming under fire from members of Congress. Like Rice, Summers could have been appointed months before political explosions forced him out. Like Rice, it appears that Summers was hung out to dry by the president, and eventually catapulted after Syria and the debt ceiling debates came together to create a virtually immovable political atmosphere for an already tough confirmation. For what time he has left, the two cases are a warning to Obama — either nominate quickly or risk losing nominees to the political intricacies of Congress.
Furthermore, Obama’s reckless appointments to the National Labor Relations Board while the Senate was in recess in January of 2012 were overturned by three different circuit courts, according to Politico. The unconventional lesson to be learned is that court decisions demonstrate the necessity of allowing the executive to appoint those positions without Senatorial confirmation in the first place.
On the judiciary end, however, the nominations process is an important check on executive power. Such a system has been seen year after year to create meaningful limits for an overzealous executive. In fact, the most important power of the Supreme Court, judicial review, was enshrined in Marbury v. Madison (1803), a case that arose over the nomination of a federal judge by outgoing President John Adams.
According to the database kept by the Senate since 1789, 36 out of 160 people nominated to the Supreme Court were not confirmed. On the other hand, just 15 of the hundreds of cabinet appointments since then have been denied, the most recent coming in 1989. And though senatorial rejection of judicial appointments has come more often, senatorial rejection of bureaucratic appointments have caused far more political controversy. At a time when Congress can barely prevent a government shutdown, re-examining this flaw in the allocation of political time could prove crucial.

Millions of viewers watched Sunday night as Miss New York Nina Davuluri joined the ranks of Americans who have been the first in overcoming social and racial barriers: She was the first Indian American woman crowned Miss America. As Davuluri erupted into tears of joy, enraged viewers angrily lashed out on Twitter, sharing their frustration at the ethnicity of America’s newest beauty. The contrast between these two reactions showed that as a whole Americans in this country are not ready for new definitions of beauty. These Twitter users show that the gains for minority groups are only symbolic and that these racial biases stunt progress in American society.
Wendy Fu | Daily Trojan
For the first 43 years of the beauty pageant, the contestants all looked similar: young, white women. As time went on and the face of America expanded and changed, the organization responded by crowning more women of color. According to its website, “Miss America represents the highest ideals. She is a real combination of beauty, grace, and intelligence, artistic and refined. She is a type which the American Girl might well emulate.”
Though the organization’s judges have not changed their views on the ideal American Girl, some viewers still have not. Some tweets accused Davuluri of being a “Muslim,” “Arab,” “7-11 worker” and even went as far as calling her a “terrorist.” Additionally, they lamented the fact that Miss Kansas Theresa Vail, a tattooed, gun-toting white female who happened fit their ideal Miss America, did not prevail.
Davuluri represents the America we live in. She was born in Syracuse, New York, attended the University of Michigan and is focused on education. She also happens to be very talented and beautiful.
Yet the fact that Davuluri’s win caused such controversy shows that everyone in this country is not on the same page. The fact that so many Twitter users felt comfortable making these racist accusations about Davuluri highlights that there are many misunderstandings when it comes to cultural differences.
This racial outrage toward Davuluri is not an isolated incident. They occur every once and a while, usually after a member of a minority group makes an accomplishment. When 10-year-old Mexican-American Sebastien de la Cruz sang the National Anthem at the NBA Finals this past June, Twitter users called him a “wetback” and “illegal.” In September, a white Florida State University student implied on social media that black students at the university should actually be attending the historically black Florida Agricultural and Mechanical University and called them monkeys. And in July, President Barack Obama was subjected to the same outcry when he spoke about the Trayvon Martin incident. Twitter users called President Obama a “n-gga,” “criminal” and “race baiter.”
Direct confrontation is needed to eliminate our country’s racial bias. As the Miss America organization exposes all of America to more diversity and cultural awareness, a conversation regarding race and ethnicity needs to be generated. Some people have never even participated in this discussion on race at all.
Because Miss America is a nationally televised program that draws viewers from all 50 states, the District of Columbia and two U.S. territories, this is an ideal opportunity to spark a discussion between Americans that involves race. Though often considered a taboo topic, it goes a long way when members from minority groups not only succeed on the national platform but acknowledge their unique position to discuss race. Not to mention the fact that the U.S. was colonized by those escaping religious prejudice and were  in essence, immigrants themselves.
During a press conference shortly following her win, Davuluri responded to the criticism she received online saying, “I have to rise above that. I always viewed myself as first and foremost American.”
In that same way, those who still harbor racial bias must rise above it to fully embrace the new face of America that is more diverse than ever.
