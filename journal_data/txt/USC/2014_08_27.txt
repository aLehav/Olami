Three professors from the Viterbi School of Engineering were named on MIT’s list of “35 Innovators Under 35” last week for contributions in their respective fields.
Those honored on the list were nominated by either the public or editors of the MIT Technology Review. Other judges, such as professors from top universities and innovation experts, analyzed the originality and impact of honorees’ works.
Professor George Ban-Weiss from the civil and environmental engineering department was named for his research in the field of air pollution and climate change.
“It’s quite an honor and it kind of took me by surprise,” he said. “I don’t think about these distinctions very much. I just tend to focus on the work that I like to do without thinking about the prize at the end.”
Ban-Weiss is concerned about finding the sources of pollutants, as well as reducing public exposure to them.
“I’m interested in pollution that comes from combustion, especially particles in the atmosphere, and understanding the sources of those particles,” he said.
Ban-Weiss also works on potential ways to counteract what is known as the urban heat island effect, a type of climate change effect that causes cities to become significantly warmer than other, less populated areas. He looks to modify roofs, pavements, walls and other areas to reduce urban temperatures and other impacts of climate change.
“It’s extremely impressive, especially for his young age,” said Trevor Krasowsky, a second-year doctoral student in environmental engineering. “He brings an energy to the department that is unparalleled in my opinion and he finds time to make connections with his students and he couldn’t be a more personal guy, and he is one of the smartest people I know.”
Krasowsky recently finished a project with Ban-Weiss as his adviser, in which he developed fuel-based emission factors from non-road sources to better characterize black carbon as a climate-forcing agent.
Megan McCain, the Gabilan Assistant Professor of Biomedical Engineering, was also named on the list for her revolutionary innovations in personalized cardiac medicine.
“We take stem cells and put them on our custom environments and hopefully convert the stem cells into functional tissue,” McCain said. “We use hydrogel, which is squishy and thus mimics human tissue and we can kind of define the proteins that the cells can grow on and we can define the topography of the surface that they grow on and the stiffness of what they grow on.”
Her ultimate goal is to build human tissues tailored to certain patients in the lab and utilize those tissues to test drugs in a high throughput, low-risk way.
Her research focuses on using tissue engineering to understand diseases and why they happen in the heart. Her project, ‘heart-on-a-chip’, is a part of the larger ‘organs on chips’ idea that tries to build micro-scale mimics of human tissues in a chip format.
“Organs-on-a-chip is exciting because it is a way for tissue engineering to really have an impact on medicine in the very near future, versus growing a new organ, which is really far away,” she said.
Students working in McCain’s lab share her enthusiasm for new developments in growing tissue.
“It’s a privilege to work in her lab and more an honor now that she has such a [distinguished] award,” said Jasper Hsu, a second-year graduate student majoring in biomedical engineering.
The third Viterbi professor to be named on the list is Professor Maryam Shanechi, a faculty member from the electrical engineering department. She was chosen for the list based on her research in using control theory to build better interfaces to the brain. Control theory seeks to explain dynamical systems in engineering and mathematics that utilize feedbacks and inputs.
Shanechi was not immediately available for comment to the Daily Trojan due to her attendance at a conference this week, but she spoke of her work in the MIT Technology Review.
“We know nothing about the signatures of neuropsychiatric disorders in the brain,” Shanechi told the MIT Technology Review. “We need to discover those. I am really excited, because there is so much we don’t know.”
She gave further explanation of her work using control theory to MIT Technology Review.
“My work takes a lot of insight from control theory. Say you reach for a glass of water — your brain wants that to happen in a certain time frame, and it’s getting visual feedback, and you can adjust the speed. The brain acts as a ‘feedback controller,’ and I have built models for how that works,” she told the magazine.

A university-wide task force will be implementing new family- and alumni-friendly tailgating zones in front of Bovard Auditorium and in portions of Alumni Park beginning with the USC-Fresno State game on Aug. 30.
The task force was a joint collaboration between various departments including Student Affairs and Residential Life. The new additions serve to provide more memorable game day experiences for families and children according to Vice Provost for Student Affairs Ainsley Carry.
“[University leadership] came up with this idea with the sole purpose of making game day a great place for everyone,” Carry said. “Like convocation and graduation events, we wanted to stage something that could involve everyone outside the stadium before home games.”
Phase 1 of the new additions will be set up directly in front of Bovard Auditorium. All USC-affiliated departments and schools will be able to reserve the two spaces for tailgating.
“The walkway will split this portion into two tailgating areas; departments and schools will be able to reserve the spaces on a first-come, first-serve basis,” Carry said.
Aside from the Bovard addition, the right side of Alumni Park facing Doheny Library will also be converted into two family-friendly tailgating venues. One portion will be dedicated to an outdoor dining space equipped with tables, chairs and a variety of food and drink for purchase. The other will be utilized as a kid- and parent-friendly zone. Inflatables, slides and jump houses will be open to children at no cost, but parents must supervise their children within the zone at all times.
Perhaps the most significant step to creating new family-oriented tailgating spaces is educating all fans about game day safety precautions. According to Carry, tailgating safety will be emphasized this season with the help of  the Dept. of Public Safety and University Communications.
“This season, there will be lots of signage all over campus highlighting key fire, alcohol and electrical hazard safety measures that have previously been easily ignored,” Carry said. “[The university has] not done a good enough job of educating about fire hazards and safety in the past … we want to ensure fan safety this season and these signs will help us do that.”
Vice President of Public Relations and Marketing Brenda Maceo will be responsible for the safety signs and other communication pieces that will be widely displayed across campus.
Rini Sampath, USG vice president, said that the new changes will make the tailgating experience more accessible for all USC fans.
“When [USG President Andrew Menard and I] were campaigning, I remember talking to students who come from different backgrounds and religions who don’t consume alcohol,” Sampath said. “A lot of game day is alcohol-centric, so these new additions will really provide more inclusive activities for everyone.”
Changes to McCarthy Quad have not been finalized as USG receives more student input. The goal is to have more alcohol-free tailgating activities developed and implemented by fall 2015.
 
 
Does anyone know of a website or phone number where I can receive more information about reserving a space for our department at USC? 
“All USC-affiliated departments and schools will be able to reserve the two spaces for tailgating.
‘The walkway will split this portion into two tailgating areas; departments and schools will be able to reserve the spaces on a first-come, first-serve basis,’ Carry said.”

The $20 million renovation of Leavey Library, which began in summer 2014, will finish on Thursday.
In December of last year, Undergraduate Student Government conducted a survey of students to determine if there was a need for renovation and, if so, what specific areas needed improvement.
Suns out, books out · The $20 million renovation to Leavey Library includes a brand new outdoor terrace with 130 to 150 seats. – Nick Entin | Daily Trojan
Hugh McHarg, associate dean of planning and communications at USC Libraries, explained what renovations have taken place during the summer. As of now, renovations are focused only on the lower level, the ground level and the outdoor terrace.
The terrace has temporary furniture that will be replaced before the end of the semester with permanent furniture that will allow for 130 to 150 new seats for studying outdoors.
On the ground level, there are 43 new seats available for studying, a 40 percent increase from last year. Improvements on the lower level include brand new furniture that allows for 115 new spaces for studying, a 43 percent increase.
Additionally, the interior of Leavey received a much-welcomed facelift with new carpeting and floors, replacing the turquoise and pink combination for softer colors such as cream and mocha on the walls.
McHarg said the USC Libraries are grateful for input and support from students for the renovations.
“[I owe] a lot of this to USG in advocating to renovate the space,” he said. “They have had two resolutions passed in two years and now the library is happy to be able to listen to students.”
He also noted the importance of a good study atmosphere for students.
“It was great to hear from the students last year, their vocalization of passion of library spaces for them,” McHarg said. “For a lot of undergraduates, the library is a central part of their experience.”
Students also seemed to welcome the changes. Myklyn Balmut, a junior majoring in political science and international relations, said the updates to the building have encouraged her to utilize the new resources.
“I had a great roommate to study with freshman year and have lived in a single for two years now,” she said. “But the renovations are definitely a motivation for me to check out Leavey Library as a place for individual and group studying this year.”
Jakov Stulic, a senior majoring in theatre and creative writing, also said he is now looking forward to using Leavey Library this year.
“The renovations will allow the library to serve as a tool for students that both welcomes them and encourages them to keep studying,” he said.
Raquel Buscaino, a freshman majoring in physics and computer science is excited to have a renovated library for her four years at USC.
“It was very refreshing when I walked into Leavey,” she said. “It is now a very good environment to study and will continue to be very attractive to students. Leavey will be my home.”

On Wednesday, USC announced seven new provisions for sexual assault prevention designed to educate the student body about sexual misconduct, encourage bystander intervention, promote awareness of available resources and remove social stigmas that hinder accurate reporting of cases.
Though introduced this week, these initiatives have been in development since fall 2013, according to Vice Provost for Student Affairs Ainsley Carry. The university’s efforts to reshape sexual assault policy follows the Title IX complaint filed in May 2013 that alleged mishandling of student reports of sexual assault.
“We are in constant review of our procedures in regards to sexual misconduct prevention efforts. A year ago, we spent some of the fall, but mainly the spring semester with student leaders who had concerns,” Carry said.
Among the new initiatives is a mandatory online module for sexual assault education, similar to AlcoholEdu for freshmen. It will be implemented next semester before spring registration and is required for incoming freshmen starting next fall.
The administration will also enact a program called Step-Up to combat the bystander effect, which refers to the social phenomenon in which people in crowds do not intervene in emergency situations due to the diffusion of responsibility among crowd members.
Carry also commended the initiative put forth by the students who have taken action against sexual misconduct.
“What we’re really looking for is community intelligence and smart ways to do this. We don’t want to launch a bunch of initiatives that make no sense for the students. Everything listed today came from student input,” he said.
He specifically named the Women’s Student Assembly, the Student Coalition Against Rape (SCAR) and student leaders representing USC’s Greek community as being particularly active in voicing their opinion about university sexual assault policies. Fraternity and sorority chapter presidents now must  attend an education program about sexual misconduct prevention and are responsible for the attendance of the members of his or her chapter. Each sorority and fraternity must have at least 80 percent of its chapter members present. Failure to achieve the attendance requirement can result in sanctions from either the Interfraternity Council or Panhellenic Council.
Another initiative will be a campus-wide task force composed of students who have volunteered to participate in coordinating the university’s efforts to address sexual assault. Jody Shipper, executive director of the Office of Equity and Diversity, will chair the task force and soon send out invitations to those who wish to be on the task force, Carry said. Members of the WSA and USG approached Student Affairs with this idea, according to Carry.
Ekta Kumar, the newly appointed Director of the Center for Women and Men, will also be one of the people overseeing the council. Kumar, who has a background in counseling and psychology leadership, hopes to inform as many people as possible about resources that the Center for Women and Men offers. Kumar expressed hope that  strategies such as partnering with campus clubs would increase awareness.
Along with the seven new initiatives, an additional Medical Amnesty/Good Samaritan policy will aim to encourage students to help or intervene to protect classmates. Students who take action will not be penalized even if they were consuming controlled substances such as alcohol. Though this new policy might result in an increase in number of reported incidents, Carry hopes this provision will hopefully reduce the social stigma or fear of retribution that prevents many bystanders from stepping in.
“There may be a time for us as an institution where we will see an increase of reported incidents,” Carry said. “We will be okay with that. That means we are removing the stigma with reporting and making easier for survivors to report. That means we are doing better with getting the education out. However, that is a short-term period. In the long term, our goal is that we can get this number closer to decreasing than increasing.”
Carry remains optimistic that the ongoing dialogue between administration and students will foster improvements in the university’s response to reports of sexual assault. He aims to keep sexual assault policy relevant by using digital tools, such as an app and a social media presence.
“In the long term, I hope we create a safer and more informed community for all students where these instances happen less and less every year,” Carry said.

From the suave swagger of Sean Connery to the steely-eyed pugilism of Daniel Craig, every generation gets the James Bond it deserves. In 1995, audiences were introduced to the latest incarnation of the dashing gentleman spy, played with a martini mix of mirth and magnetism by Pierce Brosnan, and the results were explosive. GoldenEye, directed by Martin Campbell, rescued the venerable franchise from its post-Cold War doldrums, spawning the now-classic Nintendo 64 video game and three sequels, all starring Brosnan and Judi Dench as the imperious, newly feminized M, that would keep 007’s license to kill current until Campbell returned to reboot the series again with Casino Royale in 2006.
Today Brosnan’s tenure as Bond is remembered as serviceable yet safe, an agreeably conventional take on Ian Fleming’s creation that never technically wore out its welcome — no, not even with the goofy excesses of Die Another Day — but nonetheless fell short when it came to unearthing any physical nuance or psychological scar tissue within the character. The Irish actor, a self-confessed Bond fan who was originally offered the part in 1987 but had to decline due to contractual obligations to Remington Steele, has proven his own harshest critic on the subject, revealing in a recent interview with The Telegraph that he thought he was “never good enough” in the role, adding that these feelings continue to prevent him from enjoying the movies, even GoldenEye, which belongs in the top tier of Bond films, if only for the scene where Dench’s M calls 007 a “sexist, misogynist dinosaur.”
“I felt I was caught in a time warp between Roger [Moore] and Sean [Connery],” Brosnan said during the interview. “It was a very hard one to grasp the meaning of, for me. The violence was never real, the brute force of the man was never palpable. It was quite tame, and the characterization didn’t have a follow-through of reality, it was surface. But then that might have had to do with my own insecurities in playing him as well.”
To be fair, much of what doesn’t work about Brosnan’s later Bond movies can be attributed to weak scripts, inexperienced producers and studio heads who were eager to replicate the runaway success of GoldenEye without understanding the ingredients that caused the film’s popularity to begin with. Tomorrow Never Dies, which saw 007 match wits with a Rupert Murdoch-esque media mogul (Jonathan Pryce) who sparks international conflicts to boost his network’s ratings, was the first film in the series to move forward after the death of longtime producer Albert R. Broccoli, who had been involved in shaping the franchise since 1962’s Dr. No. His heirs, Barbara Broccoli and Michael G. Wilson, were less willing to take risks with the character, and their reluctance shows in every frame. The movie, plagued by constant rewrites and an unhappy cast, eventually surfaced as a stiff, middle-of-the-road affair that lacked the edginess and maniacal energy of its predecessor.
The next installment, 1999’s The World Is Not Enough, is unfairly maligned as one of the worst Bond movies because of its convoluted plot and Denise Richards’s unfortunate performance as Dr. Christmas Jones, the world’s least convincing nuclear physicist. Brosnan, however, nearly redeems the story’s numerous shortcomings by turning in his all-time best performance as 007, who finds himself torn between his love for the beautiful, damaged oil baroness Elektra King (Sophie Marceau, one of the most underrated Bond girls), and his duty to thwart the megalomaniacal aspirations of Renard (the memorably menacing Robert Carlyle), a KGB agent-turned-anarchist who has become impervious to pain thanks to an assassin’s bullet lodged in his skull.
Brosnan donned the tuxedo for the last time in 2002’s Die Another Day, which opens with a disavowed Bond being captured and tortured in a North Korean prison camp, a compelling, out-of-the-box development that in many ways presages the grit and humanity of Casino Royale, but the rest of the film quickly devolves into a cartoonish cavalcade involving ice palaces, invisible Aston Martins and, no kidding, the world’s first racial reassignment surgery. The only other standout scene is a well-choreographed fencing match between Bond and deranged billionaire Gustav Graves (Toby Stephens), but even that is tainted with a distracting, self-indulgent cameo from Madonna, who also provided the movie with its infernally catchy theme song.
Brosnan’s Bond movies might be criticized for playing it safe, but the actor himself has never had any qualms about riffing on his super-spy persona. He appeared in John Boorman’s excellent 2001 adaptation of John le Carré’s The Tailor of Panama as a nasty, amoral MI6 agent who appears to have more than a little in common with the world’s greatest secret agent. It’s an utterly fearless performance that exaggerates Bond’s signature character traits — the ironic detachment, the shameless womanizing — and reimagines them as the manipulative tools of a sociopath.
Then there’s Richard Shepard’s The Matador, the pitch-black comedy Brosnan made shortly after it was clear he wouldn’t be returning as Bond, swapping his tailored suits and mannered charm for a black speedo and a sailor’s mouth as a boorish, over-the-hill assassin who invades the lives of a hapless married couple played by Greg Kinnear and Hope Davis. There were even rumors, vague but persistent, that he was teaming up with Quentin Tarantino for an unofficial, hard-R adaptation of Casino Royale in the years leading up to the release of the Campbell-Craig version.
Now, more than 12 years after his last Bond movie, Brosnan is ready to return to the spy game with a straight face. Though critics are pummeling his new movie The November Man, it’s nonetheless gratifying to see the actor returning to his action thriller roots on his own terms (the movie was funded by his Irish DreamTime production company), albeit with a few more gray hairs and a believably world-weary grimace. The plot centers on Peter Devereaux (Brosnan), an ex-CIA spook who comes out of retirement to protect a valuable witness (ex-Bond girl Olga Kurylenko) from his former protégé Mason (Luke Bracey). Hopefully the film, based on a series of political thrillers by novelist Bill Granger and directed by The Bank Job helmer Roger Donaldson, will tap into the same subversive spirit that made Brosnan’s other pseudo-Bond projects so fascinating and weirdly cathartic. After all, who better to take down 007 than the man who brought him back to life?

When USC Marshall student Vincent Fong launched FindMySong — the equivalent of a musicians-only Facebook — earlier this year in April, he had high expectations for his project. Fong believed he had created something new, creative, innovative, perhaps even something necessary for musicians in the future. A violinist himself, the Hong Kong native created the site out of his  frustration — a frustration all too familiar to anyone who has dipped their toes in the music industry.
Making waves · Vincent Fong, a student in USC’s Marshall School of Business, wanted to faciliate musical collaboration. – Mariya Dondonyan | Daily Trojan
“[All the] networking, copyrighting, file sharing, portfolio management, I realized it’s hard work,” Fong said. “Musicians can be really specific, making it difficult to find the exact people you need when you’re looking for help or looking to collaborate.”
Fong aims to use his creation to find solutions to these pressing issues. A website that resembles the likes of Facebook, LinkedIn and Dropbox, the platform facilitates efficient and effective musical collaboration.
Users create profiles that focus on their skills, preferences and current projects, and find other artists who share a common ground. With specific search tools, it becomes easy for users to find projects to audition for in a collaborative effort to create music.
The site also includes group messaging and file sharing to help artists communicate with each other during the audition and recording processes. The most unique part about FindMySong however, is how deftly the website deals with complex legal issues such as ownership. The platform allows its users to assign copyright to project members and manage rights from one central board, helping avoid messy disputes and violations.
The website has proven to be both innovative and successful. In March, Fong and his colleagues — all USC students — entered the annual Student Startup Madness competition. Participants were given the chance to pitch their ideas to investors, create professional connections and learn more about emerging technologies. Fong’s team was selected to present and won third place in the competition.
Now, three months, 3,500 users and more than250 uploaded files since its launch, FindMySong’s next mission is to create a  circle within the present community that is composed of only USC students.
“We want an internal system where students within the USC network can find one another easily,” Fong said. “Since April [when the website was launched], we’ve talked to many students and faculty member and discovered that an internal system would be beneficial.”
The idea to add this USC-specific group within the site was a response to a growing dissatisfaction with existing music sharing methods within the university.
“The students complained about how bad Blackboard was when it came to sharing multimedia files,” Fong said. “They told me they would end up uploading their music to Soundcloud and then emailing the link of that to the professor. That just sounds super inefficient to me for both parties.”
By creating an internal community comprised exclusively of USC students, artists will have the opportunity to work and play together in person, while being guaranteed counterparts of exceptional quality.
“At the end of the day, the musicians want to meet each other,” Fong said. “There are also problems with trust issues. You want to make sure you can depend on the other artist,” Fong said. “I believe making a private group for just USC students may fix these two problems.”
After sharing his thoughts with professors from the Thornton School of Music, Fong was invited to a few classes to present the project to students. The feedback he received was positive, giving him confidence that the website could one day become the official platform used by music students and teachers alike. Fong received a particularly strong response from freshmen students.
“Freshmen love it because it also gives them the opportunity to connect with older students too,” Fong said. “Typically, a freshman would not likely be exposed to the same opportunities that are given to seniors.”
Interestingly, Fong firmly believes in a “bottom-up” approach towards the implementation of his site. By having the support of the student body as evidence of his project’s potential for university-wide application, the school authorities would be more easily persuaded to approve the site for student use. He  has already been invited music students to sign an online petition, asking USC to bring FindMySong to the Thornton School.
The website for the petition states that a significant number of signatures are needed to make this happen, but with all the support Fong is receiving from both students and faculty, approval from the administration could soon become a reality.
Fong and his colleagues have also started planning another project. During the young entrepreneur’s time at USC, he has met many film students from the School of Cinematic Arts through mutual friends and classes. After talking to film majors this past year, he realized that similar problems exist in the film industry. With his growing interest in the medium, he hopes to expand and evolve FindMySong to allow budding filmmakers to collaborate on movie production and promotion.
On the surface, Vincent Fong seems like just another man in the sea of students walking through Trousdale Parkway. In reality, Fong is someone who marches to the beat of his own drum, transforming USC and the online musical landscape into an environment that makes music something to be truly created and enjoyed by all.

The USC women’s volleyball team will open up its season this weekend during the Community Bankers Volleyball Classic in Stockton, California. Though the USC roster is younger than last year, USC will still be seen as the heavy favorite.
Record-wise, USC will have the upper hand on the other three teams competing in this two-day tournament: Rider, Arkansas-Little Rock and the University of the Pacific, which is hosting the event.
Last year, USC fell just short of a national title, but they still won an impressive 29 games. Arkansas-Little Rock had the next best overall win total of all the teams with 20.
Similarly, USC also had the least number of losses last year with only six overall losses, which is impressive considering the USC women’s volleyball team played more games last year than that of any opponent it will face this weekend.
The USC women’s volleyball roster will be different this year with a much younger team, but there are a few big name players for the Trojans returning this season that will help the team in its quest for a national title.
USC’s second-best player in kills and points last year, sophomore Ebony Nwanebu, is still sidelined due to injury for now, but she will definitely be a big boost for the team upon her return.
Until then, USC women’s volleyball coach Mick Haley is looking at players like junior outside hitter Samantha Bricio to lead the team. Bricio recorded the most kills and the most points last season for the Women of Troy, and says she now has to step up as a leader for her team, but also gave props to the freshmen on the team for their progress.
“The only thing I have to do is have a bigger leadership role on the team right now,” Bricio said. “The freshmen are doing a really good job right now.”
Still, Haley admitted that his team is younger than last year and that they  will need to improve in this first tournament. Haley is already using certain tactics to accomplish that goal.
“We spent about 6-7 weeks already working on a couple of things,” Haley said. “We really need to nurture and bring these young kids along and as long as we can help keep their self-confidence and their focus and they can get adjusted to school here in the next 3-4 weeks while we travel and play, then I believe that this is a special team.”
Haley also said that over the coming weeks he will be looking for his servers and blockers to follow the game plan.
The newcomers to the team will be a crucial factor in determining this season’s outcome. USC freshman middle blocker Jordan Dunn described the transition from high school volleyball to a top collegiate volleyball program at USC.
“It’s an amazing feeling like being able to come on this team, because they’re all such amazing athletes and amazing people,” Dunn said. “I’m just trying to work hard, gel with the team, work my hardest during every practice and see where I can fit in.”
In terms of strategy for the tournament, Haley said he plans to temper fan expectations.
“We have goals that are different than the expectations that you may hear out there on the social media,” Haley said. “We know exactly where we are. This tournament allows us the opportunity to play somebody new that we haven’t played. We feel we have good talent, but we we’re not taking any of these teams for granted.”
Considering last year’s stats, Haley may very well be right.
Rider sophomore Kaitlyn Griffin wreaked havoc last year, leading her team with 249 kills and was second in hitting percentage at .312. Rider senior Ashlee Amatulli and junior Brandie Hill were a dynamic duo in the assist column in 2013, racking up 972 assists combined last season.
USC will also face some stiff competition from Arkansas-Little Rock players Edina Begic, Sonja Milanovic, and Adisa Hodzic. Finishing first, second and third, respectively, in kills and points for Arkansas-Little Rock last season, these players will test the USC defense. In addition, Begic and Milanovic finished with 582 digs combined in 2013, so the USC offense will have their attacks strongly contested as well.
The Pacific Tigers will be a good match-up with USC, despite their record last season. They averaged 13.21 kills per set while USC was slightly better at 14.9 kills per set. The USC women’s volleyball team also had better numbers than the Pacific in blocks per set and assists per set, but these averages were also very close. Adding in the home court advantage for the Pacific, the Tigers will likely give USC a run for their money.
After the tournament, USC will be part of two more tournaments before they actually begin playing standalone games.
Bricio and Dunn commented that this season will not be easy, especially since there is a lot of travel and tournament play involved.
Haley also said his team has one of the hardest overall schedules this year, but he still believes he has a great team that will turn into something even greater in the coming weeks.
“They’ve already shown their volleyball IQ and intellect,” Haley said. “I have every reason to believe that we’ll have a team that continues to get better each month.”

Here’s what we know about the Josh Shaw situation: At some point between USC’s annual Salute to Troy dinner on Saturday and the Trojans’ Monday morning practice, the senior defensive back suffered two high ankle sprains. Shaw originally claimed that his injury was the result of rescuing his drowning nephew, a story that garnered him a considerable amount of praise.
We also know that Shaw’s story is a complete fabrication. He admitted Wednesday that he made up the entire sequence of events and has since been suspended from the team indefinitely. Perhaps tellingly, Shaw even retained a high-profile defense attorney.
A police report has surfaced from Saturday night that claims a man was seen jumping from a third-story balcony at an apartment near campus during an attempted break-in. Josh Shaw is named in the report as the boyfriend of an apartment resident, not as a suspect.
That’s it. That’s all we know. We do not know how Shaw sustained his injuries, or why he lied to the world. We do not know if he committed or was involved in a crime.
USC, the police, Steve Sarkisian and most of the country remain in what Sarkisian called a “holding pattern,” waiting for evidence on that front. But the big story is out there — Josh Shaw lied, and now it’s up to us to pick up the pieces.
And as much as we all want to talk Trojan football, the media has embraced this “holding pattern” as well. So even though our epic rematch with Fresno State looms on Saturday, I still have to talk about Josh Shaw.
Here’s the thing that bothers me — and forgive me for going out on a limb here — but something about this situation just doesn’t feel right. If Shaw injured himself in a manner that he would wish to hide from his coaches and university, or even, God forbid, in the course of a criminal act, why invent a story that puts you in the national spotlight? It just doesn’t make sense.
It would hardly have been a blurb on ESPN’s radar if Shaw injured himself while going for a post-practice run, or helping a teammate move. Instead, he was named one of SportsCenter’s three stars of the night just hours before the questions about his injury began.
Maybe what feels the worst about the Shaw story is how eerily familiar it seems.
I still remember exactly where I was when the news of former Notre Dame linebacker Manti Te’o’s fictional girlfriend broke — and I’m not exactly a big Fighting Irish fan. Now it seems as if the two stories will be permanently linked in the long history of college football scandals.
We all remember the tragedy surrounding Te’o as he marched his way through a debateably Heisman-esque 2012 season. In a span of six hours, his grandmother and “girlfriend” passed away, leading to unparalleled media coverage of the rest of Notre Dame’s season.
Now even if you believe — which I, politely, don’t — that Te’o was indeed an unknowing victim of an internet hoax, it’s important to remember that he admitted to never meeting the woman. At least by the dawn of the 2012 season, it’s fair to say he knew something was up. And yet he, and those closest to him, fabricated a story that turned him into a short-lived national hero. Just two years later Josh Shaw has done the same thing.
The question no one can figure out, though, is why. Why would Manti turn himself into a media sensation and not quietly end the hoax before the season? Why would Josh Shaw, if not tell the truth, at least not fabricate a cleaner story?
These guys had to know that even with a little digging their stories would start to show holes. A quick Google search cast doubt on Lennay Kekua’s existence. Similarly, the timeline of Shaw’s incident never quite added up. If Shaw left USC between 9 p.m. and 9:30 p.m. as reported, conservative estimates put him in Palmdale by 10:30 p.m. at the earliest. It’s certainly not impossible to believe that a 7-year-old child who could not swim was in the pool at such a late hour by himself, but it’s somewhat unlikely.
This was apparently a qualm shared by USC Athletic Department officials, one of whom anonymously told Rivals.com that the school had serious doubts regarding Shaw’s story, and advised him against sharing it with the media. Still, Shaw went ahead and spread his lie to anyone who would listen.
And people did listen, especially the sports media. He had to have known they would. He had to have known someone might investigate his story further. And he had to have known that when even the smallest crack showed in his story that the media would jump all over it. Sure, it’s sad that the impact of social media speculation permanently soiled Shaw’s reputation before anyone actually knew the truth. But that blame still has to fall on Shaw, who failed to learn anything from the Te’o debacle.
Maybe we’ll never know what inspired Josh Shaw to come up with such an outrageous lie. At this point it could be anything from simply a poorly-thought-out cover-up to a not-so-slick grab at fame. As much as I’d love to know what was going through the 22-year-old’s head, it really doesn’t matter. Josh Shaw screwed up — plain and simple. And all he needed to do to avoid it was look back at history.

Despite the whirlwind of rumors surrounding senior cornerback Josh Shaw’s actions this weekend, USC’s football team tried its best to stay focused at Wednesday morning’s practice.
Clear eyes · First-year head coach Steve Sarkisian has his hands full with the Shaw situation but feels his team’s only goal is defeating Fresno State. – Ralf Cheung | Daily Trojan
The No. 15 Trojans are gearing up for their first game of the season against Fresno State on Saturday.
Wondrous wideouts
Redshirt junior quarterback Cody Kessler looked in tune with his wide receiving corps Wednesday morning, highlighted by a long touchdown to sophomore Darreus Rogers.
Rogers is listed as junior wide receiver Nelson Agholor’s backup on the current depth chart but flexed his muscles in a few games last year, putting up a total of 257 receiving yards.
Kessler also completed a number of passes underneath to redshirt junior wideout George Farmer, who is looking to make a big impact in 2014. Farmer was competing for a starting job last year before tearing ligaments in his left knee.
Head coach Steve Sarkisian was impressed with his offense’s fluidity.
“Great Wednesday,” the first-year coach said. “Awesome Wednesday practice. I thought the guys came with a real intense attitude. You could feel the energy in the air, you could feel their passion.”
Injury update
Redshirt junior running back Tre Madden did not practice and was still wearing a protective boot on Wednesday.
Though the Trojans are deep at the running back position, Sarkisian is treading lightly with Madden, who has been prone to injury in the past.
“I don’t want to use the word concerned,” Sarkisian said. “I’m always hesitant with a running back or a big guy that has a toe injury because I want to make sure that that toe is healed. So we’re just being very cautious with Tre because we want him healthy. This is a long season.”
Sarkisian also noted that two offensive guards, redshirt freshman Khaliel Rodgers and redshirt sophomore Jordan Simmons, are on the road to recovery.
He noted that Rodgers will probably be a game-time decision on Saturday, while Simmons will probably have to miss the game.
“We’re starting to get on the mend with those guys that were coming off some of those major injuries,” Sarkisian said. “We’re starting to get our depth back to where we feel comfortable for Saturday.”
Role players 
Sarkisian was impressed by the play of his scout team on Wednesday, many of whom are new to their roles after spending much of the spring and summer playing with starters and backups.
The scout team players mimicked Fresno State’s formations and personnel to better prepare the Trojans for Saturday’s game.
“I thought the service periods were excellent,” Sarkisian said. “I thought the service kids did a fantastic job. That was one of the challenges coming out of training camp. Making that transition from guys getting reps with the ones, twos or threes to now being part of the service team.”
Sarkisian further expanded on the importance of these role players on a successful football team.
“Their role in our program, their role in providing looks to the offense, defense and special teams, gets them prepared for Saturday,” he said. “All in all I thought they did a tremendous job of that today and in turn made us better the last two days.”
Quick hits
Sarkisian said the hard, physical work is over for the team this week, and Thursday’s practice will focus more on technique and cleaning things up.
Fresno State’s quarterback situation is still in flux. Brian Burrell or Brandon Connette  could start.

Senior cornerback and co-captain Josh Shaw has been indefinitely suspended from all football activities after he admitted to lying about the nature of the ankle injuries he suffered on Saturday night.
Just joshin’ · USC senior defensive back Josh Shaw has admitted that he did not in fact suffer injuries to both ankles while saving the life of his drowning nephew. Shaw, who is suspended, had four interceptions last season. – Ralf Cheung | Daily Trojan
On Sunday, USC Athletics released a statement saying that Shaw was out after suffering two high ankle sprains sustained after jumping off a balcony at a family function in Palmdale, California. The statement claimed that Shaw jumped in order to save his nephew from drowning in a pool below.
The fabricated story garnered national attention, and Shaw was lauded as a hero by his teammates and the media.
But following Tuesday morning’s practice, head coach Steve Sarkisian disclosed that USC received phone calls questioning the validity of the story and that the Athletic Department would investigate.
Despite the media firestorm that ensued, coaches and players reaffirmed their faith in Shaw’s character, stating that he had always demonstrated integrity both on and off the field.
On Tuesday evening, ABC 7 news aired a phone interview with Shaw’s sister, Asia. She vouched for her brother and reiterated his story about injuring himself while jumping from a balcony, despite admitting that she was not present at the family function.
More conflicting information emerged when Shaw was named in an Los Angeles Police Department report on Wednesday morning. Officers responded to a woman screaming in her apartment on the 500 block of Figueroa Street on Saturday night. The woman identified herself as Shaw’s girlfriend and witnesses described a man with dreadlocks fleeing from the balcony, which matches Shaw’s description.
According to the Los Angeles Times, Shaw came to USC’s Athletic Department on Wednesday afternoon with his family and his lawyer and admitted to fabricating the entire story about rescuing his nephew.
“We are extremely disappointed in Josh,” Sarkisian told USCTrojans.com. “He let us all down. As I have said, nothing in his background led us to doubt him when he told us of his injuries.”
Sarkisian explained further.
“I appreciate that Josh has now admitted that he lied and has apologized. Though this type of behavior is out of character for Josh, it is unacceptable. Honesty and integrity must be at the center of our program. I believe Josh will learn from this. I hope that he will not be defined by this incident, and that the Trojan Family will accept his apology and support him.”
Shaw issued the following statement via his lawyer, Donald Etra: “On Saturday August 23, 2014, I injured myself in a fall. I made up a story about this fall that was untrue. I was wrong to not tell the truth. I apologize to USC for this action on my part. My USC coaches, the USC Athletic Department, and especially coach Sarkisian have all been supportive of me during my college career and for that, I am very grateful.”
Etra has also represented celebrities such as Snoop Dogg and Rihanna in high profile cases.
According to Fox Sports’ Bruce Feldman, Shaw hired Etra on Wednesday as a precaution. As of now, there is no criminal investigation involving Shaw.
“I’m confident he was not running from anything,” Etra told Feldman.
USC’s Athletic Department issued an apology for running the original story and has since removed the article from its website.

This week, American journalist Peter Theo Curtis was released by the Syrian terrorist group Jabhat al-Nusra. Curtis was captured in October 2012 after he entered Syria to cover the raging civil war that ravished the country. After two years of talks and discussions with other countries in the region, the United States was able to secure the safe and peaceful release of Curtis to American authorities. Curtis’s capture is not an anomaly. According to The Guardian, in an annual report last November, the Committee to Protect Journalists estimated that at least 30 journalists had been kidnapped or had disappeared in Syria. Curtis’s case, though, is one that supports the longstanding U.S. policy against any government negotiations with terrorists. A change in stance would essentially undermine America’s core values.
Curtis’s case stands in stark contrast to the tragic story of another American journalist who was captured in Syria, James Foley. Like Curtis, Foley was covering the civil war in Syria and was captured in 2012. A video surfaced last week of Foley being beheaded by the militant group ISIS.
Though Foley’s story unfortunately ended in an appalling manner, both stories of American journalists demonstrate the effective policy of not negotiating with terrorists. It is important to note that even if the $132 million ransom had been paid for the release of Foley, his safety was never guaranteed. Even if it had been ensured, the rest of the hostages currently held by ISIS would still be in danger. The Foley video pictured Steven Sotloff, a freelance journalist that had disappeared in August 2013, in the background.
Terrorist organizations do not operate on the same principles of integrity as governments and their word cannot be trusted. The groups resort to terrorism because they hold alternative views of the world and they want their voices to be heard. If negotiations are offered, these groups will be given increasing power and influence, legitimizing their methods of violence. If the United States had started to bargain with ISIS, organizations like Al-Qaeda and the Taliban might want to take part in captive negotiations as well. Moreover, using civilians as tools for negotiation is beneath the integrity and values of the U.S. government. Diplomatic routes with other countries, in cooperation with the United Nations, offer a more secure and democratic route for the release of captives.
As the preeminent global military power, the United States should lead the way in demonstrating to radical organizations that their demands will never be met if they utilize barbaric and antiquated methods of killing captives. The killing of journalists and American citizens is inexcusable and atrocious. It does no good to negotiate with those who undertake those actions to get what they want. After all, even in the event their ransom is paid, where do the demands stop? The mere uncertainty to this question points to the host of issues present in the concept of negotiating with terrorists. Most importantly, though, is that the paying of ransoms and meeting of terrorist demands compromises the beliefs of the United States.

Is it true that 99% of all terrorist acts are committed by Muslims?  
It is interesting to note that the Barbary Coast War – America’s first war – involved Muslim pirates (think Somalian pirates) capturing our commercial vessels and their crew and holding the crew for ransom.
Same as it ever was.

On Aug. 21, the Drug Enforcement Administration increased restrictions on the prescription of hydrocodone, the most common form of painkiller in the country. This marks the completion of the final step in a policy shift — and a step in the right direction.
Grace Wang | Daily Trojan
 
The new rule is one of the most far-reaching efforts to stop the growing epidemic of prescription drug abuse. Hydrocodone combination drugs such as Vicodin, Lortab and their generic counterparts will be joining pure hydrocodone as a Schedule II substance in the Controlled Substances Act, as opposed to their former classification as Schedule III substances, a category for less addictive drugs with known medical purposes. According to The New York Times, under the new rule, physicians won’t be able to call in prescriptions by phone. Patients will have to return to a health care professional to get refills on the same prescription. The policy will go into effect Oct. 5.
Soon, statistics should reflect a reversal of the current situation of substance abuse in the United States. The National Institute on Drug Abuse reported that 5.1 million Americans abused pain relievers in 2010. In addition, more than 20,000 Americans die every year because of prescription drug abuse, according to The New York Times.
According to Rehab International, of all painkillers, Vicodin is the most notorious for seguing to addiction. While its intended use is to treat pain, it also triggers an intense sense of euphoria by releasing dopamine. Overdose can be life-threatening and withdrawal can cause chills, headaches, severe anxiety and insomnia.
Before the DEA policy change, hydrocodone combination substances and other Schedule III substances could be prescribed for a period of 180 days without renewal. The new classification creates regulations for pharmacists, patients and prescribers alike by shortening that time period to 90 days. In addition, all prescriptions must be made in writing, not over the phone.
Strict prescription restrictions for Schedule II drugs aren’t new to the American public. Common ADHD drugs such as Vyvanse and Adderall are placed under this scheduling. Nevertheless, there are opponents claiming that the tighter restrictions will make the prescription harder to obtain for those who truly need it. That is true, but while the restrictions might seem confining, that’s kind of the point.
The vast majority of prescription drug abusers first obtain the drug from friends or family, especially when the addiction starts at a young age. Crackdowns on street dealers won’t make a difference; it’s important to place restrictions on the pharmaceutical delivery of abused drugs.
Yes, it might be more difficult for patients with a legitimate need to access their prescriptions, but in the words of Andrew Kolodny, chief medical officer for rehab center Phoenix House, “If you’re treating someone with a condition so painful they require treatment with a highly addictive drug, that’s someone who should be monitored closely.”
In order for the Controlled Substances Act to function in the way it was intended to function, patients must understand that just because a drug helps them doesn’t mean that it helps others. It also doesn’t mean that the particular drug they started using is the only cure to their pain.
Clearly, addiction and abuse is neither the fault of the patients, nor the fault of anyone in the medical world.
Despite the fact that many of the original classifications were drawn on non-scientific, cultural lines (i.e. the classification of marijuana as a Schedule I drug with high potential for abuse and no medical purpose), lawmakers continue to sit on the throne of the Controlled Substance Act when regulating the medical profession. The act either shouldn’t exist or needs a serious facelift.
For example, the act originally placed Vicodin in the same classification as Tylenol #3 (acetaminophen with codeine). Their classification supposedly signifies that they have less potential for abuse and a currently accepted medical use in the United States. Vicodin, however, is a combination of acetaminophen and hydrocodone that poses a significantly higher risk of emotional and physical dependence than Tylenol. According to a study in the March issue of Academic Emergency Medicine, Vicodin is not superior to it’s safer alternative, Tylenol #3 in dealing with acute pain.
Many substances haven’t been moved from their original classification in 40 years, despite significant advances in medical science. Whether it was the person that dies every 19 minutes from prescription drug overdose or the nearly 8.76 million Americans abusing prescription medication as of 2010, drug abuse finally caught the attention of the Obama administration.
With a little patience from current Vicodin users and vigilance from doctors, this move can help the Controlled Substances Act actually start doing its job: keeping everyone healthy, patients and addicts alike.

Senior cornerback and co-captain Josh Shaw has been suspended from all football activities indefinitely after he admitted about lying about the nature of the ankle injuries he sustained on Saturday night.
Shaw shanks redemption – Senior cornerback Josh Shaw (6) had four interceptions for the Trojans last season and was recently named a team captain. News of his suspension comes three days before the Trojans are set to face Fresno State.
On Sunday, USC Athletics released a statement saying that Shaw was out indefinitely after suffering two high ankle sprains because he leapt from a balcony at a family function in order to save his nephew who was drowning in the pool.
Monday morning at practice, head coach Steve Sarkisian disclosed that USC had received inquiries questioning the validity of the story and that he would look into it.
Still, coaches and players reaffirmed their faith in Shaw’s character, stating that he had always demonstrated good character both on and off the field.
But on Wednesday afternoon, Shaw came to USC’s athletic department and admitted to fabricating the entire story about rescuing his nephew.
“We are extremely disappointed in Josh,” Sarkisian told USCTrojans.com. “He let us all down. As I have said, nothing in his background led us to doubt him when he told us of his injuries, nor did anything after our initial vetting of his story.
“I appreciate that Josh has now admitted that he lied and has apologized. Although this type of behavior is out of character for Josh, it is unacceptable. Honesty and integrity must be at the center of our program. I believe Josh will learn from this. I hope that he will not be defined by this incident, and that the Trojan Family will accept his apology and support him.”

I was wrong to not tell the truth. I apologize to USC for this action on my part.

On Tuesday, the National Science Foundation announced a three-year, $3.5 million grant to USC, California Institute of Technology and UCLA in order to foster collaboration between public and private institutions and promote technology innovation in the Southern California region.
The NSF, an independent agency created by the federal government, has designated Southern California as its next “node” as part of its Innovation Corps (I-Corps) initiative. The Los Angeles area joins the five other I-Corps nodes in the San Francisco Bay, New York City, Washington, D.C., Georgia and Michigan, as well as a forthcoming node at the University of Texas in Austin.
Andrea Belz, academic director of the Master of Science in Entrepreneurship and Innovation program at the Marshall School of Business and a Caltech alumna, will serve as director of the Southern California node.
“We are thrilled to be part of NSF’s visionary I-Corps program. This award will strongly accelerate the growth of the study and practice of entrepreneurship and innovation management throughout our region,” she said in a statement to USC News.
The goal of the I-Corps program is to encourage scientists and engineers to connect with business leaders on- and off-campus to bring their ideas to fruition. At USC, the I-Corps node will bring together Belz and Yannis C. Yortsos, who helped secure the grant and is dean of the Viterbi School of Engineering. They will work to educate entrepreneurs about potential business opportunities based on research done within universities and the I-Corps program.
Working with leaders at Caltech and UCLA, USC hopes to strengthen Los Angeles’s position as a technological center for the country.
“With the largest number of talented engineers graduating from Southern California institutions than from any other geographic region in the nation, the conditions are just ripe for this creative transformation for the benefit of the region and the nation overall,” Yortsos said in a statement to USC News.

Campus Pride, a national organization for lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender student leaders and campus groups, named USC one of the top 50 most LGBT-friendly campuses in the United States on Aug. 15.
Allied Pride · Rainbow flags hang on lamp posts along Trousdale Parkway in honor of Coming Out Month last October. — Razan Al Marzouqi | Daily Trojan
Campus Pride based the rankings on its Campus Pride Index, which ranks colleges and universities on the basis of eight factors: LGBT policy inclusion, support and institutional commitment, academic life, student life, housing, campus safety, counseling and health and recruitment and retention efforts. More than 425 schools were ranked this year, with 56 achieving the highest possible rating of five stars.
According to Rev. Kelby Harrison, director of the LGBT Resource Center, several factors helped set USC apart from other campuses.
“We have a non-discrimination policy for both sexual orientation and gender identity and expression,” Harrison said. She also gave credit to the administration for helping to recruit LGBT students and focus on retention. She credited the LGBTRC, which has has a professional staff to support students and to help advocate for LGBT issues across campus.
Response to the ranking has been positive. “It’s such a big step for USC,” said sophomore human biology major Natasha Natarajan. “I’m really excited because it just shows how important LGBT issues are to our school.”
Last semester, Undergraduate Student Government passed a resolution to create gender-neutral housing on campus. Such housing, however, has yet to be created.
“I’m not saying it’s perfect here, but a lot of work has been done in making this campus very friendly towards queer people,” said Emily Huang, a senior majoring in sociology. Huang is the networking chair of the Queer & Ally Student Assembly and co-president of OUTreach, a club dedicated to community service in the LGBTQ and ally community.
Students and staff, however, agreed that there is more to be done on campus to make USC an even more LGBT-friendly university. Harrison hopes to see the addition of LGBT studies to the list of minors offered at USC. Troy Rayder, a junior double majoring in gender studies and sociology, cited QuASA’s efforts to push for gender-neutral housing and gender-neutral bathrooms.
“There’s been a lot of support for it lately, but it’s now just about implementation,” Rayder said.
Similarly, Huang hopes to see even further progress on campus.
“It’s not just tolerance that we need. It’s more about acceptance and integration, in a sense,” she said.
Each campus included in the rating has a profile of the school on Campus Pride’s website. The Campus Pride Index was created in 2001 by a team of national LGBT researchers in order to promote improvement of LGBT groups on campuses across the U.S. Among the other schools listed on the Top 50 are nine California universities, including Stanford University, UCLA and Pomona College.

The story behind USC senior defensive back Josh Shaw’s recent ankle injury took a bizarre turn today, as the validity of his version of events came into question. Head coach Steve Sarkisian announced at practice this morning that the athletic department had received  calls questioning Shaw’s claims that he suffered two high ankle sprains in the act of saving his young nephew from drowning last Saturday night. Sarkisian was supportive of the newly named co-captain, but said USC would investigate further.

“Within the last few hours or so we have gotten a few calls contradicting what Josh said occurred Saturday night,” Sarkisian said. “We’re going to continue to vet it.”
The incident, which took place in Shaw’s home of Palmdale, California, came under further scrutiny when anonymous sources later claimed a police inquiry was underway. The Palmdale Sheriff’s Department quickly denied having any information on an investigation regarding Shaw, followed by a similar denial from the Los Angeles Police Department.
LAPD, which had planned a news conference this afternoon, was adamant that it had nothing to do with Shaw.
As a mob of reporters circled around him this morning, Sarkisian defended Shaw’s character and stood behind him.
“He’s a good person,” Sarkisian said. “He’s a good kid. He came to us with what had occurred Saturday night and I have no reason, no history to not believe Josh and his story.”

Journalist Julie Chen visited the Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism on Tuesday as a guest speaker for Professor Mary Murphy’s entertainment, business and media course.
Chen, who co-hosts CBS’ The Talk and the CBS reality series Big Brother, graduated from the Annenberg School in 1991.

Murphy said that Chen, along with Barbara Walters, Meredith Vieira and Katie Couric have expanded the role of female journalists on American television. Annenberg Dean Ernest Wilson III said it was fitting to welcome Chen as one of the first guests in the new Wallis Annenberg Hall.
“I applaud the example she presents to the Annenberg school, which is 80 percent women,” Wilson said.
During her time at Annenberg, Chen said she and her fellow students were told it would be beneficial to take a job in a smaller news market but she was reluctant to leave Los Angeles and worked for four years behind the scenes at the local ABC station before taking a job at a local news station in Dayton, Ohio.
“I looked at that job as a super long business trip,” Chen said.
She admitted that she has faced sexism and racial discrimination throughout her career. While in Dayton she was told she would not get the opportunity to anchor the newscast because she was Asian and, therefore, didn’t look like the market the newscast was attempting to reach.
Chen admitted publicly on The Talk last year that she had eyelid surgery but emphasized to Murphy’s class that it was not an attempt to look less Asian, though some in her family were offended by her decision.
“I met with an agent who looked at my resume tape and was saying you have to [get the surgery] to look more interested. During your cutaway shots you look bored. This guy said ‘You get it done, you will go to a top ten market.’ I did.” Chen said.
Chen said that while women in the news industry have made great strides, society still treats women differently from men, and it will likely remain that way for the foreseeable future.
“I feel there is a level of sexism when a woman can’t go gray if they’re in front of the camera but a man can,” Chen said.
But that was only one of many difficult decisions Chen would face. After moving to New York and starting work as a newsreader for CBS, she was approached about hosting a new reality show called Big Brother. At the time, Chen said she was still doing the morning news in New York and her dream was to work for 60 Minutes. She was told she could continue doing morning news, but if she did not take the job hosting Big Brother it could be considered insubordination because she was a CBS employee.
“They said they needed someone who knows how to ask questions on live TV and I asked ‘Am I forever sealing the door on 60 Minutes?’ and [the person in charge of the news division] said ‘yes,’” Chen said.
Chen, who is married to CBS President and CEO Les Moonves, said that after she had a baby she wanted to stay in Los Angeles permanently rather than move between Los Angeles and New York. When the opportunity came along to be a co-host on The Talk, it was intriguing.
Chen is the only journalist by trade who sits on the panel which consists of Chen, Sheryl Underwood, Aisha Tyler, Sharon Osbourne and Sara Gilbert. Much of the show consists of interviewing celebrities rather than covering hard news stories as Chen did early in her career.
“It’s a lot of fun,” Chen said. “It’s not as important, but at this age and stage of my life I have a five-year-old, I can’t get sent to the Middle East because I may not come back.”
Joshua Guerra, a sophomore psychology major, said it was interesting hearing about the variety of subjects Chen had the opportunity to cover.
“I’m considering studying journalism,” Guerra said. “I don’t watch The Talk and I didn’t know much about Julie [Chen], but it was interesting that she made such a big jump in her career.”
Freshman public relations major Alena Beas said she follows celebrity culture and news closely and was excited to have the opportunity to speak with Chen in person.
“Annenberg always discusses how they are able to bring important, well-educated guest speakers, and tonight they did,” Beas said.
For sophomore psychology major Melissa Hatch, the fact the Chen was a USC alumna was the most exciting part of the event.
“She was in our place not too long ago and, being a woman, it was great to see how she made it so far,” Hatch said.
