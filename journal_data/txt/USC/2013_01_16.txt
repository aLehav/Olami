A team of gamers from the Information Technology Program in the Viterbi School of Engineering will advance to the finals of a Call of Duty tournament this weekend.

The team — composed of Graham Hawes, Yingteh Lee, Andrew Molina, Isaac Steele and Aaron Liu — will be flown to the Nvidia Headquarters in Santa Clara, Calif., for the final showdown on Jan. 19.
Though it’s called gaming, the competition is serious stuff: All members of the team have committed significant time to practicing, frequently getting together to play Call of Duty: Black Ops and watching archived videos of gaming competitions to better hone their skills and anticipate those of other teams. Players researched the guns used in the game and collectively logged hundreds of hours in preparation.
As the team now readies for this weekend’s final tournament in Santa Clara, members said they couldn’t be more excited or sure of a USC victory. In the first round of the competition, USC will play against a team from North Carolina State University, who Hawes anticipates will employ some “unorthodox strategies.”
If the Trojan gamers advance from there, they will be up against the winner of a round between UC Berkeley and a wild-card school.
“In all honesty, I think that we will win the whole thing. Cal may prove to be challenging for us, but we are all very competent players,” said Liu, a freshman majoring in electrical engineering. “We are [set] to play NC State first, which we are confident that we can beat.”
The victors of the final tournament will go home with a full PC gaming system provided by Maingear Computers along with Nvidia’s latest graphics processing unit. The winning school will also be awarded hardware donations for the computer science department.
Hawes, the team captain and a junior majoring in computer science, was initially approached by Tom Sloper, the faculty advisor for USC eSports, about competing in the Nvidia event. Hawes talked to friends and quickly organized a team.
In December, the group of five claimed victory in the USC vs. UCLA Match Roundup, guaranteeing them a spot in the finals and earning them four state-of-the-art computer systems, valued at $12,000, from the Nvidia-sponsored competition GeForce GTX Call of Duty Rivalries.
“I have played some amateur competitive games in the past,” Hawes said. “I love competition and it always manages to get my blood hot.”
Liu joined after hearing about the competition against Bruin gamers. Seeking to bring the crosstown rivalry to a new, digital front, Liu quickly responded to Hawes’ recruiting efforts. Though the USC vs. UCLA Match Roundup was Liu’s first time competing, he said he felt like a pro gamer.
“It felt rewarding beating UCLA, because I participated in [the event],” Liu said. “But, overall, I appreciated their sportsmanship in the loss.”
For Hawes, who said he’s been gaming since he was old enough to hold a Game Boy, the win over UCLA felt like a tremendous victory.
“It felt pretty good and felt even better after we saw their pre-game trash talk in the post-event video recap,” Hawes said.
Hawed said he’s ready to taste victory again.
“Winning the match against UCLA felt great and, come Saturday night, I want to be feeling that all over again … but with a brand new computer to boot,” Hawes said.
Open to public to watch? And can I do competive gaming there as well?

Students gathered under Tommy Trojan on Wednesday night to show solidarity with Aleppo University in Syria, which was bombed Tuesday by the Syrian government.

As others stopped to look on, participants held signs and lit candles, which were placed at the foot of the statue to form the word “Syria.”
“I think it’s really nice that students are coming together in solidarity for this event, even though it happened so many miles away,” said Nashwah Akhtar, a junior majoring in communication and one of the event’s participants.
Zade Shakir, a junior majoring in international relations and biological sciences, believes the tragedy is particularly significant because college students were targeted.
“The victims were university students,” Shakur said. “We’re university students. To think kids that were going to get an education — innocent people — were killed in a bombing … It could have been anybody.”
The bombing, which killed at least 82 people according to Syria’s U.N. ambassador, Bashar Jaafari, marks another violent outbreak in Syria’s civil war, which began in March 2011.
After hearing news of the bombing from various news sources, USC students decided to gather in support of the victims. The vigil, which took place from 6-7 p.m., was organized on Facebook by Asmaa Albaroudi, a junior majoring in human development and aging. After hearing about the bombing, Albaroudi felt she needed to act.
“I was born and raised [in the United States], but my parents are Syrian,” Albaroudi said. “I’ve had family members imprisoned in Syria, so when I saw university students being killed, I thought I could raise awareness here.”
Albaroudi believes that the events in Syria constitute a humanitarian crisis, one that is often overlooked by the media. She also believes that the university was targeted because of its students’ opposition to Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, who has been accused of human rights abuses by groups such as Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch.
“The people who are demanding their freedom right now, a lot of them are the youth,” Albaroudi said.
Albaroudi said the vigil was not political, but she said the cause of the bombing is clear.
“This is just a humanitarian event, but it’s pretty obvious who the perpetrators are,” Albaroudi said.
One of the signs at the vigil read: “On January 15th, the Syrian Regime bombed the University of Aleppo in Syria: 80 dead, 150 wounded.” Others included pictures of the rebels’ flag, which has a green stripe at the top to replace the red stripe of the Assad regime.
Syria’s civil war, often associated with the Arab Spring uprisings, has been more protracted and bloody than its counterparts in other countries. Samer Rashad, a junior majoring in neuroscience and an attendee of the vigil said the Syrian conflict requires as much public awareness as its counterparts in Egypt and Yemen, because of its violent nature.
“After the Egyptian revolution, people assume that this is similar,” Rashad said. “But in reality, it’s more of a civil war. Syrians are killing each other.”
When asked if it’s time for international involvement in Syria, Albaroudi said it is time for the world to act.
“Other countries need to take more involvement in what is going on,” Albaroudi said. “Over 60,000 people have died in Syria. This doesn’t include the people that have been displaced or wounded. It’s time.”
Why should we get involved?  We did so in Egypt and now the Islamist, American-hating, Muslim Brotherhood rules the day.  We did so in Libya and now an Islamist force rules the day.  We tried in Iraq, Afghanistan, Pakistan, stopped Saddam in Kuwait, etc…only to be thanked with hatred and derision.
Maybe it’s time Muslims took care of their own mess and quit begging America and the West to help.  I mean, really, with the wealth and western-bought armaments that the Saudis, Qataris, Kuwaits all have why don’t they solve these problems themselves?
We’ve tried hard, power, soft power, endless free aid (jiyza) and all for naught.  It’s time Muslims took care of their own problems and leave us out of their latest mess.
>>“The people who are demanding their freedom right now, a lot of them are the youth,” Albaroudi said.<<
Freedom, eh?
As in the new-found freedom as seen in Egypt, Libya or Tunisia?  Let's get real, Albaroudi, freedom and Islam are oxymorons.

The USC Engemann Student Health Center, which stands more than double the size of the old center, opened Jan. 4 to accommodate the needs of the growing USC student population.
Healthy changes · The Engemann Health Center is open Monday through Friday from 8:30 a.m. to 5 p.m. It serves all university students. – Razan Al Marzouqi | Daily Trojan
 
Lawrence Neinstein, executive director of the Engemann Health Center, said the need for a bigger health center has become evident over the past few years.
“When I moved over from Children’s Hospital in 1995, we saw 30,000 visits a year [at the old student health center]. We are now at 90,000. We did 500 immunizations and we are at close to 20,000 [this year],” Neinstein said. “This has become a residential campus with far more health needs of students on campus.”
Administrators said the center’s new features make it more productive. All of the programs that the student health center offers are centralized, with the counseling office moved to the health center. There is also a state-of-the-art call center, which responds to students’ calls more efficiently, as well as three times the number of exam rooms. Additionally, the center also features a student educational resource room.
Neinstein said the health center also has a 24-hour nurse hotline that covers everything from mental health calls to simple scrapes. The center also has a pharmacy on its lower level.
“First, we will be getting the building up and running and make sure students are served with our current services,” Neinstein said. “The call center should really help students calling in for information about many issues including insurance, refills and appointments.”
The plans for the new health center began nearly two decades ago, as the university gathered resources. The university broke ground in 2011 after a $15 million donation from Roger and Michele Dedeaux Engemann. Michele Engemann is a ‘68 School of Dramatic Arts alumna and daughter of baseball coach Rod Dedeaux.
The health center moved from its previous location on 34th Street to 1031 W. 34th St., next to Fluor Tower, because of its larger size.
“We started planning in 1996 and have gone through multiple plans and sites. This ended up as the best location to include all of the various programs,” Neinstein said. “We are thankful for the large donation of our donors, whom the building is named after, and support of [Vice President of Student Affairs] Michael Jackson and senior administration to make this happen for students.”
Many students said they are happy with the new health center because they felt certain aspects of the old health center was inadequate for their needs.
“The only thing that needed improvement was wait time. Even when I made an appointment, it took forever for me to see a doctor,” said Candice Coll, a freshman majoring in psychology.
Melissa Bonner, a freshman majoring in neuroscience, said she has already noticed improvments.
“It was much easier to check in and see my doctor,” Bonner said. “It’s more spacious and it will allow for more patients to come and its much more aesthetically pleasing.”
The new center is 105,000 square feet and six stories tall, while the old one was two stories tall, built in 1951 and required some services to be housed elsewhere because of a lack of space.
“If you combine all our prior locations, the students health space is over double the square footage and more in line with national benchmarks,” Neinstein said. “From the health centers I have visited across the country, this is one of the best facilities.”
The old location of the student health center will be used to house the USC Glorya Kaufman School of Dance, set to open in spring 2014.
USC donors and faculty have high hopes that the new health center will increase productivity for the growing USC University Park Campus.
“[The new health center will provide] better access, better better flow, better integration of services between disciplines and better communication between our staff and students,” Neinstein said.
Thank you for printing article.  We are extremely proud of new health center but even more so of our extremely dedicated staff.
However, it would be very helpful to print the open hours.
We are open Monday to Thursday evenings until 7 PM for urgent issues, i.e 8:30 AM to 7 PM
Fridays we are open 9:30 AM to 4:30 PM
SATURDAYS AND SUNDAYS: We are also one of few student health centers in country to be open seven days a week during academic year.
We have open hours for urgent problems Saturday and Sunday 10 AM to 2 PM.
We are closed on university holidays.
We are here for you.  Use our website at http://www.usc.edu/engemann where you can make appointments online and send us your feedback. If you have a concern about our services, send us your feedback. And if you like our services, nice to get that feedback also :).
Thanks

The Women of Troy hope to continue their undefeated start to 2013 up by the Bay Area against two of the top-10 teams in the nation, as they get ready to face No. 7 California on Thursday, Jan. 17 and No. 6 Stanford on Sunday, Jan. 20.
USC (7-8, 4-0 Pac-12) is off to its best conference start since the 2004-05 season and is currently tied with No. 14 UCLA (13-2, 4-0 Pac-12) for first in the Pac-12.
Moving forward · The Women of Troy look to continue their winning ways on the road. In their previous trip to Berkeley, the team defeated the Golden Bears 76-75 in a thrilling overtime contest. – Chris Pham | Daily Trojan
 
“That’s a really good way to come into this upcoming road trip at Stanford and Cal,” Harberts said when asked about the standings.
The Trojans have won their last four games after a six-game losing streak to end 2012. They’ve been led by Cassie Harberts, who is averaging 21.3 points and 9.3 rebounds per game in conference play, and Ariya Crook, who is averaging 13.3 points, 4.0 assists and 3.8 rebounds per game in conference play.
The Women of Troy are coming off a pair of home wins over the weekend, beating Washington (12-5, 4-2 Pac-12) 81-72 on Friday, Jan. 11 and edging out Washington State (5-11, 1-4 Pac-12) 61-59 on Sunday, Jan. 13. Harberts (24 points, 11 rebounds) and Kate Oliver (12 points, 13 rebounds) both recorded double-doubles against the Huskies, while Crook added 23 points and five assists. Jazmine Davis led the Huskies with 37 points on 12-of-28 shooting.
Crook took a hard foul with under a second remaining and hit two free throws to give USC a 61-59 win over the Cougars. She also finished with 14 points and set career highs with nine rebounds and six assists. Harberts added 18 points and 10 rebounds, and Oliver finished with 10 points and six rebounds.
“Our chemistry is finally building on and off the court,” Crook said.
“I think we just got sick of losing, too,” Harberts noted. “I got sick of losing.”
Stanford (14-2, 3-1 Pac-12) and Cal (13-2, 3-1 Pac-12) played their last two games against each other, splitting the two contests. Stanford won the first one on Tuesday, Jan. 8 at Berkeley, 62-53. Chiney Ogwumike contributed 26 points and six rebounds, while Amber Orrange added 15 points for the Cardinal. Layshia Clarendon finished with 17 points and six rebounds for the Golden Bears on 6-of-20 shooting.
Cal was able to bounce back in the following game, beating the Cardinal 67-55 at Stanford on Sunday, Jan. 13. Brittany Boyd scored 19 points for the Bears, while Gennifer Brandon added 14 points and 12 rebounds. Ogwumike scored 18 points and grabbed nine rebounds for the Cardinal, who had their 81-game conference winning streak snapped.
The Cardinal are led by Ogwumike, who is averaging 21.4 points and 11.6 rebounds on the season, and Joslyn Tinkle, who is averaging 12.0 points and 5.5 rebounds. Boyd and Clarendon are both averaging over 13 points and 4.1 rebounds per game for the Golden Bears.
USC beat Cal last year 76-75 in overtime, but lost to Stanford 69-52. Both games will be televised on the Pac-12 Network, with the games starting at 6 p.m. and 4 p.m., respectively.

USC football coach Lane Kiffin denied multiple reports of a locker room brawl following USC’s 21-7 loss against Georgia Tech in the Sun Bowl.
“Contrary to media reports, there was not a brawl or altercation in our locker room after the Sun Bowl,” Kiffin said in a statement released by the university Wednesday. “There was a noisy verbal exchange among a couple players who were frustrated with the outcome of the game. It lasted less than a minute and was nothing physical. It happens sometimes in football locker rooms after a disappointing loss.”
The Los Angeles Daily News reported Wednesday that a fight involving upward of 15 football players broke out after a number of freshmen on the team questioned whether or not the seniors were giving full effort in their final collegiate game. Quarterback Matt Barkley, safety T.J. McDonald and center Khaled Holmes were among the outgoing players. Junior cornerback Nickell Robey later announced his intentions to declare for the draft as well.
ESPN later expanded on the original story by the Daily News, adding that “multiple sources told ESPN that a ‘flat-out brawl’ transpired when one of the team’s younger players began ‘bad-mouthing’ Matt Barkley.”
Barkley also denied the accusations that anything physical took place, telling ESPN Radio host Colin Cowherd that “tempers flared … guys were expressing their opinions, for better or worse, but we had it under control. It was nothing to be alarmed about.”
The Trojans completed a disappointing 2012-13 campaign with a 7-6 record after falling to Georgia Tech on Dec. 31. They entered the regular season as the No. 1-ranked team in the Associated Press top 25 poll but dropped five of their last six contests after starting 6-1. USC lost starting quarterback Barkley to a right shoulder injury in the closing minutes of a 38-28 defeat against the UCLA Bruins, and he wasn’t able to return in time for the team’s bowl game in El Paso, Texas.

On Monday morning, I was woken up by the sound of my phone vibrating. Still groggy, I picked it up and was immediately snapped out of my daze: men’s basketball coach Kevin O’Neill had been fired.
My initial thought was how strange the timing seemed: After all, the team had just won a game, something it doesn’t do very often. But my next thought was far more serious, at least in the football-crazed USC community’s mind:
Ticking clock · With losses mounting and recruits leaving, Kiffin may be looking over his shoulder at Haden after Kevin O’Neill’s dismissal. – Carlo Acenas | Daily Trojan
What does USC coach Lane Kiffin think about this?
Try as we might, most of us at USC have not been able to extricate images of the failed 2012 football season out of our heads. I am sure many sleepless nights have been spent tossing and turning over images of Stanford fans rushing the field, senior quarterback Matt Barkley lying injured on the Rose Bowl turf and that dreaded goal-line stand against Notre Dame at the Coliseum. These images have surely had staying power in my mind.
But more important, at least for Kiffin’s sake, is how often Athletic Director Pat Haden ruminates with these memories. In listening to the grumblings around campus, it is apparent that Kiffin might not have the highest approval rating from Trojan fans. But it is the opinion of Haden that matters most and one has to wonder what that opinion might be, given what has transpired these past weeks.
The two biggest factors that weigh into the judgment of a head football coach are how his team performs on the field and how well he recruits. We all know that Kiffin’s team failed miserably in the former this past year, but it is in the latter qualification, one that Kiffin has a reputation for exceeding in, that he has struggled mightily as of late.
Over the course of about six weeks, USC has had five of its verbally committed recruits renege on their pledges to play football for the Trojans. The reasons for each vary, but the trend is troubling, to say the least.
First came wide receiver Eldridge Massington’s decommitment in early December. The Texas native has since pledged to enroll at UCLA next season. Then, after months of speculation, safety Max Redfield, an Orange County prospect, left the Trojans and committed to Notre Dame on Jan. 4 at the Under Armour All-American game. Two others in that time frame, wide receiver Sebastian LaRue and defensive lineman Eddie Vanderdoes, dropped their commitments to USC but have yet to commit elsewhere.
But the biggest shocker in the string of decommitments came nearly 10 days ago, when defensive end Kylie Fitts of Redlands, Calif., announced that he was no longer committed to USC. Fitts had been a longtime fan of the Trojans and was set to begin classes this week after graduating early from high school. But because of the commitment of another recruit, defensive back Leon McQuay III of Florida, there was no room for Fitts on the roster at this time. This left Fitts dismayed and he has since began scheduling visits to other schools.
Fair or unfair, Kiffin has taken criticism for the loss of Fitts. Many in the recruiting circuit have lashed out at Kiffin for his perceived dishonesty and, as Fitts’ high school football coach Kurt Bruich put it, being “shady.”
These instances where a player has a change of heart are commonplace in the recruiting world, but for it to occur at such a high volume is concerning. And the last thing a coach with Kiffin’s reputation needs at a time like this is to be accused of deceitfulness, especially considering he is coming off such a disappointing season.
And to throw gasoline onto the proverbial fire, reports came out Wednesday alleging that anywhere from 10 to 15 USC football players were involved in a locker-room altercation following USC’s embarrassing 21-7 loss to Georgia Tech at the Sun Bowl.
Though the allegations have been refuted or claimed to have been exaggerated by Khaled Holmes and Matt Barkley on Twitter, things appear to be going from bad to worse for Kiffin, who is presumably already on the coaching hot seat for next season. But why O’Neill’s firing should matter to Kiffin is this: Haden is not afraid to pull the plug at any time, even in the middle of the season and even after a victory. Anyone who assumes that Kiffin will have a full year to prove himself capable of leading USC’s football program need only to refer to Haden’s handling of O’Neill, a coach that Haden himself did not hire and someone who had to deal with NCAA sanctions and troublesome off-court incidents during his time at USC.
Sound familiar?
The point is: Just as was the case with O’Neill, time is running out for Kiffin to pick up the pieces. Job one will be to salvage this recruiting class, one that, despite the aforementioned losses, is still ranked in the top-10 nationally. But the next step, one that has proven to be difficult for Kiffin, will be to translate all the talent on USC’s roster into wins on the field. And while Kiffin continues to scramble to right the ship, he’ll now have to do it with the knowledge that Haden will be watching with an ever-ready hand on the trigger.
@USC Alum – is that the “I broke up with them first” face saving comment?
Nick- Just an FYI but we dropped Massington and Larue, not the other way around. They do not have committable scholarship offers for 2013.

The Bob Cantu era at USC begins Thursday night as the Trojans return home from a Rocky Mountain road trip to host the No. 21 Oregon Ducks at 8 p.m.
Looking up · The USC men’s basketball team has lost its previous five contests to the Oregon Ducks dating back to Jan. 30, 2010. – Priyanka Patel | Daily Trojan
 
USC (7-10, 2-2 in Pac-12 play) is coming off an impressive 17-point road win over Utah last Saturday, while the Ducks (14-2, 3-0) knocked off previously unbeaten No. 7 Arizona last week and are ranked in the Associated Press top-25 for the first time since 2007.
The Trojans will be playing their first game without former USC coach Kevin O’Neill, who was fired Monday. Cantu was named the interim head coach, presumably until the end of the season.
After a five-game losing streak in the non-conference schedule, the Trojans have won three of their last five and look to be on the upswing. The coaching change, however, means a change in playing style is underway and that coveted minutes could be up for grabs Thursday night.
“As a coach, you just need to be open-minded to anything and be able to adjust,” Cantu said. “The biggest thing in this situation and any situation as coach is listening to your players.”
Cantu also mentioned in a press conference Monday that he plans to implement more zone defense and wants a more aggressive defensive effort.
“I want turnover pushers,” he said. “There’s a lot of ways of putting points on the board, so we have to find ways of doing that on the defensive end more often.”
Cantu also plans to increase the tempo of a Trojan offense that is 11th in scoring in the Pac-12. Leading scorer Eric Wise (11.9 points per game) hopes to help in that regard and has some ideas on how to quicken the team’s production.
“I’m cool with my role [on offense], but maybe just like where I can get other people involved,” Wise said. “Maybe [I can] drive more and kick it.”
Junior forward Dewayne Dedmon is having arguably the best stretch of his career, and the 7-foot Dedmon could team with 7-foot-2 junior center Omar Oraby to give the Trojans a definite height advantage in the post. Dedmon is averaging 10.8 points, 8.4 rebounds and three blocks per game over his past five contests.
“[We’re] just trying to keep the energy and making sure everyone’s on the same page,” Dedmon said on preparing for Oregon while dealing with the coaching change. “If we can just take that momentum from Utah and just keep it rolling, then it’ll definitely be good.”
Though the on-court results of having Cantu calling the shots have yet to be seen, the visiting Ducks are off and rolling to their best start since their Elite 8 run in 2007. Under third-year coach Dana Altman, the Ducks run a balanced, high-tempo offense that is averaging 76.4 points per contest.
Every Oregon starter is averaging double-digit scoring, with shooting guard Damyean Doston leading the way with 11.8 points per game. Center Tony Woods anchors the paint for the Ducks, while forward Arsalan Kazemi is averaging 9.4 rebounds and adjusting to his new role as sixth man after transferring from Rice University.
A critical weakness of the Ducks is their tendency to be turnover-prone. The Ducks hold the dubious distinction of leading the conference with 15.4 turnovers per game, though Oregon does lead the conference in forced turnovers as well. In the Ducks’ two losses, they averaged 18 turnovers.
The burden to stop Oregon’s lightning-quick point guard Dominic Artis, who shot a combined 25.8 percent from the floor in those two losses, will likely fall upon USC senior point guard Jio Fontan.

The USC women’s tennis team started its season off with a bang, taking all six singles matches and winning doubles play in convincing fashion against UC Irvine at home on Wednesday.
Serving aces · USC sophomore Zoe Scandalis is ranked No. 19 and No. 13 in the country in singles and doubles play, respectively. – Ralf Cheung | Daily Trojan
 
Head coach Richard Gallien was very pleased with how the team played and was excited to start the season.
“I’m almost 52 and I’ve spent almost half of my life playing or coaching tennis,” Gallien said.  “And yet it’s not old hat to me.  It’s exciting.  We get to tussle and fight again.”
During doubles play, USC’s combination of junior Kaitlyn Christian and sophomore Sabrina Santamaria fell behind early before eventually rallying to defeat the Anteaters’ top doubles team 8-5. The Women of Troy will rely heavily on the Christian/Santamaria duo, as the two come into the season as the top ranked doubles team in the nation.
Sophomores Gabriella DeSimone and Zoe Scandalis followed their lead and overcame an early deficit to notch an 8-4 win. Newcomers Giuliana Olmos and Ellie Yates rounded out doubles play, registering an 8-5 win in their first match together.
“I thought we were sluggish for some reason starting off in the doubles, but you’ve got to start somewhere,” Gallien said.  “We did just fine.  We have some tougher tests right around the corner quickly.”
The Women of Troy continued their stellar play during the singles portion of the match.  Olmos and Yates were impressive in their USC debuts.  Olmos tallied a 6-2, 6-0 win in her first singles match, while Yates triumphed with a score of 6-0, 6-1.  Gallien was excited for both girls, but noted that Olmos’ victory was especially satisfying after she was forced to sit out last year due to an NCAA ruling.
“No one is hungrier to compete than Guiliana Olmos,” Galien said.
After the victories by Olmos and Yates set up the Women of Troy with a 3-0 lead, the stage was set for DeSimone to seal the victory. DeSimone, who enters the season ranked No. 56 in the nation, did just that with a 6-1, 6-2 defeat of her opponent.
Following DeSimone’s clinching victory, Christian handily won her match to give the Trojans a 5-0 advantage. That was followed by senior Valiera Pulido winning a tough match 6-3, 6-3 to move the Trojans closer to a perfect sweep.
Rounding out singles play was star senior Danielle Lao, who entered the match as the team’s highest ranked player at No. 14.  Lao faced tough competition in UCI’s All Big-West performer Kristina Smith and struggled early on. After trailing Smith 0-3 in the second set, Lao utilized strong serves and sound execution to recover and wrap up the day for the Women of Troy with a 6-3, 6-4 victory.
“When you have two girls who are equally matched as Danielle and Smith were, you have to be able to outlast [the opponent],” Gallien said.  “This group was definitely up to the challenge.  You’ve got to be ready for a bar fight in these tough matches.”
Gallien added that the squad will split up for the Freeman Memorial Tournament in Las Vegas, Nev., and the National Collegiate Tennis Classic in Palm Springs, Calif. The Women of Troy will look to repeat their success from last year in both tournaments, as Scandalis won the Freeman Memorial while Lao was victorious at the National Collegiate Tennis Classic.
Also notable was the absence during singles play of standouts Santamaria and Scandalis. Gallien assured that the two would play singles this weekend and added he was simply giving some other girls a chance to compete and grow.
The Women of Troy (1-0) will next play at home against Akron on Jan. 26 as part of the ITA Kick-Off Weekend before heading to Malibu to play Pepperdine on Jan. 31.

As the so-called Digital Age begins to pick up speed, the private art of putting pen to paper seems almost antiquated.
Sharing your thoughts on the latest political development is as easy as sending out a mass tweet, and real-time Facebook status updates add a dimension of unparalleled accuracy to the chronicling of daily events. Slower forms of reflection, such as keeping a written diary or writing letters to ourselves, simply aren’t staples of our everyday lives anymore. Instead, we’ve traded personal intimacy for full disclosure, and privacy is almost a foreign concept — except when it comes to literary culture.
Books have long made use of “diary-entry” formats to entice readers with full-bodied narratives. Classics such as Alice Walker’s The Color Purple and Bram Stoker’s Dracula entertained with characters who turned to epistolary methods as a means of self-expression. Most recently, Stephen Chbosky’s The Perks of Being A Wallflower earned a name for itself as a modern take on The Catcher in the Rye, and a successful movie adaptation starring Emma Watson and Logan Lerman hit theaters last fall.
But despite the varied subject matter in each of these literary works, all share common themes of self-exploration. Dracula’s Jonathan Harker slowly unravels the mystery of his otherworldly host as he pauses to write about each of his dastardly experiences in Dracula’s castle; by recording the details of Dracula’s appearance and unusual habits (and later by reading the entries in his fiancée’s diary), Jonathan draws larger connections that help him defeat his foe.
On a more contemporary take on the diary form, The Perks of Being A Wallflower’s Charlie writes to an unknown individual named “Friend,” but eventually, his letters become a journal of sorts; he begins to use the one-sided correspondence to understand his reaction to the suicide of his friend Michael and to record his interactions with newfound friends Sam and Patrick. Readers watch Charlie achieve a startling level of maturity as the novel progresses, and Chbosky’s fresh approach to epistolary methodologies creates a narrative that never falters in its complexity and entertainment value.
Despite the allure of public social networking, it’s hardly surprising that we still find ourselves intrigued by these journalistic texts. We are, after all, still just as obsessed with ourselves as we were in the 1600s, when diary writing exploded in the mainstream culture of Western Europe. Though these 17th-century individuals also kept journals to record wages or keep track of purchases, writing down their thoughts provided a straightforward means of introspection and a way to assign some significance to even the most mundane activities.
Today, however, that intimate climate has shifted to the public eye. Popular publishing platforms such as WordPress or Blogspot allow users to reflect on their inner musings, but now that information is privy to anyone with Internet access. Instead of concentrating their efforts on personal growth and development, social media users project an image, one formed from carefully selected videos, photographs and sentence fragments, of how they want to be seen by others — not necessarily of how they truly are. What was once an authentic method of self-exploration has become an artificial mode of false expression, and many broadcasted contemplations seem devoid of any larger significance.
But perhaps this is why we continuously return to texts like The Color Purple or The Perks of Being A Wallflower. Honesty intrigues us, and we are constantly drawn to human expressions that prove relatable in their sincerity. As he moves through adolescence, Charlie remains refreshingly genuine, connecting with the reader at a level that is beyond the superficial. His quirky inner monologue portrays confidence even as he describes emotions that are far from comfortable.
“I just know that another kid has felt this,” Charlie writes. “This one time when it’s peaceful outside, and you’re seeing things move, and you don’t want to, and everyone is asleep. And all the books you’ve read have been read by other people. And all the songs you’ve loved have been heard by other people. And that girl that’s pretty to you is pretty to other people. And you know that if you looked at these facts when you were happy, you would feel great because you are describing ‘unity.’”
Here, privacy affords Charlie an authenticity unparalleled by any other public medium. Yet Chbosky even adds another layer to notions of journalistic privacy. At the novel’s end, Charlie thanks the unknown “Friend” for listening to his letters and writes that “they were better than a diary because there is communion and a diary can be found.”
So, technically, Charlie is confiding in someone, even though he still understands the mechanics of honest self-expression. He also recognizes that there is something unifying about sharing personal experiences with others, though he remains cautious of strangers stumbling upon his private musings.
With Charlie’s mindset, it seems possible to have both personal and shared intimacy. As a final New Year’s resolution, try taking a dual approach to publicizing self-discoveries. I enjoy spending my evenings organizing my frazzled thoughts into a private diary, basking in the simple art of personal reflection without the pressure of an added audience. When I’m writing this way, jotting down the day’s events lends an extra level of spontaneity to undergraduate life, which can easily seem dull and repetitive with formulaic class structures and extracurriculars. Even if it’s just for my eyes alone, my life takes on a greater significance.
But on the other hand, I also need to share my epiphanies with a few close friends and, yes, sometimes on my Facebook page. I’m best at this, however, only when I’ve taken the time for complete introspection: Saying anything meaningful while worrying about the perspectives of others is nearly impossible.
So when you write, do so honestly and unflinchingly and adopt a Wallflower mentality. Curl up with a notebook splayed across your lap and “let the quiet put things where they are supposed to be.”

Loved, loved this article! Handwritten letters and or diaries are the best. I used to write a lot in high school then one day my boyfriend got a hold of it, read it then questioned my every single sentence and thoughts. I threw my diary away and swore I’d never write again. What I do now, is an occasional email journal entry to myself. Never thinking anyone would ever read it, a couple of weeks ago my email got synced with a newly purchased tablet at home. Someone read it and again I got questioned about my inner most deepest sentiments. I crave writing, I miss it. I have so much to say. My mind and my heart can’t hold it all in inside my head…… I am sad. Very sad…..

Brooklyn indie outfit Beach Fossils is back and better than ever with their forthcoming second full-length LP, Clash The Truth.
Christina Ellis | Daily Trojan
 
Though now a four-piece band, Beach Fossils originally began as the solo project of Dustin Payseur, who burst onto the dream-pop scene in 2009. Following a lackluster self-titled debut LP in 2010 (and the more impressive 2011 What A Pleasure EP), Clash is an effective expansion upon Beach Fossils’ original sound. Vast changes in production, consistency and musicianship manage to slip by without compromising the band’s dream-pop sensibilities. Beach Fossils succeeds in displaying a substantial amount of growth and fine tuning without fully abandoning the warm-hearted, DIY melancholia that initially captured the hearts of indie devotees.
The songs flow seamlessly — with scintillating and bright guitar riffs, delicate vocals and a relentless drum-heavy rhythm section, Clash seems effortlessly catchy.
The album opens with its titular track, which, over the course of two minutes, builds with an unrelenting pace and finishes the repetitive crowd-chanting of disjointed lyrics. The words invite the participation of an angst-ridden audience as a crowd of voices chants “Dream, rebel, trust, youth, free, life, clash, truth […] nothing, real, nothing, true.”
This track in particular appeals to a more punk aesthetic that will surely have the most austere of hipsters shouting along. Clash is by no means a cerebral track — instead, Payseur’s lyrics seem to appeal to an inherently youthful dissatisfaction with not knowing how to “get it right.” This song musically sets the tone for the rest of the album, which seems to have been crafted with a deliberate focus on the sound and energy of a live performance.
“Generational Synthetic” follows suit, showing Beach Fossils at high velocity and adding a bit of spunk into the mix of other more languid tracks. The track urgently presses on with lyrics depicting a sense of artistic frustration as the lonely, self-affirming Payseur sings, “And I will do it on my own again / And I will say what I will.”
Meanwhile, the gritty, jangly guitar on “Careless” makes it arguably the strongest, and no doubt the catchiest, song of the album — an impressive feat for an album that already sports many strong hooks.
The band also knows when to strip back its compositions: “Taking Off” stays true to the simplicity found in earlier Beach Fossils tracks, and its minimalist take offers fewer bells and whistles but is worth a listen.
Beach Fossils explores further territory by bringing in a collaboration, here with Kazu Makino of Blonde Redhead. Makino lends her distinctive vocals on the fuzzy track “In Vertigo,” serving as a pleasant contrast to Payseur’s signature drone.
Rounding out the end of the album, bright guitar is juxtaposed by a more menacing sounding bassline on “Caustic Cross,” which at times sounds like a reverb-soaked unreleased Joy Division track. Penultimate track “Ascension,” a short instrumental, sounds like high-quality bedroom dream-pop at its finest and fades nicely into the rapid-fire drums and guitar of the frantic, very cool final track, “Crashed Out.”
Fans of The Drums, Surfer Blood, DIIV, Beach House, Wild Nothing and Real Estate are sure to be delighted by Clash’s jangly surf-pop vibes, while New Wave and post-punk disciples should also be satisfied by a familiar ’80s influenced structure.
Beach Fossils’ new release is not really anything new for their genre, nor does it necessarily seek to challenge any preconceived notions of the band’s surf-pop or dream-pop pigeonhole. However, Clash The Truth does mark a major shift for the band in establishing a group sound — and with the addition of new permanent band members comes a welcomed shift in dynamic.
Still just as delightfully despondent and introspective as in prior releases, Dustin Payseur’s lo-fi bedroom solo project has evolved into a finely tuned collaborative recording effort built upon an already successful model. However, unlike previous Beach Fossils releases, the album is not supported only by a few standout singles but rather by the fact that each track contributes uniquely to a far more successful whole.
With a fuller and more complex instrumental sound, an impressive growth in song structure and an unforgettable knack for catchy hooks, Beach Fossils’ Clash The Truth is nothing short of an exceptional indie record.
Great review, however I disagree on the terse description of the debut record as “lackluster.” For me, it was anything but and remains so.

Every year enthusiastic audiences join filmmakers at the Sundance Film Festival for 10 days of dramatic and documentary films, shorts, performances, panel discussions and lively music events.
The lineup for the 2013 Sundance Film Festival, on Jan. 17 – Jan. 27, has a selection that promises to live up to expectations set by years past.

Feature films are getting a lot of attention at this year’s festival. The selected films  bring fresh ideas about life and the art of storytelling.
A regular to the festival, screenwriter Lynn Shelton returns to Sundance with her film Touchy Feely, which takes a detailed look at a family whose psychic balance suddenly unravels. Abby (Rosemary Dewitt) is a successful massage therapist and free spirit, while her brother Paul (Josh Pais) thrives on structure and principle, running a dental practice and volunteering his dramatic daughter Jenny (Ellen Page) to be his assistant. Suddenly, Abby develops an aversion to bodily contact, which hinders her career as well as her love life. Meanwhile, rumors of Paul’s “healing touch” begin to enhance his business as well as his home life. As Abby searches to find her new place in life, her brother discovers a whole new side of himself.
On a more feel-good note, screenwriter David Gordon Green (Eastbound & Down, Pineapple Express) displays his expertise of character study in Prince Avalanche. An unusual couple, the high-maintenance Alvin (Paul Rudd) and his girlfriend’s dopey brother Lance (Emile Hirsch), leave the city to repaint the lines on the country highway that has been damaged by wildfire. As they embark on their journey, the two men butt heads when they exchange stories but eventually learn about alternative approaches to self-discovery from each other.
Keeping with his chosen genre, screenwriter Jim Mickle (Stake Land) paints a grotesque, suspenseful portrait of an introverted family struggling to maintain their ghoulish traditions in We Are What We Are. Frank (Bill Sage) privately rules his family out of determination to keep his ancestral customs intact by any means necessary. When a rainstorm hits the area, tragedy occurs and it is up to Frank’s daughters, Iris (Ambyr Childers) and Rose (Julia Garner), to put meat on the table — but not the kind that can be found at the local grocery store. As the storm drags on, the police begin to uncover the dark secret within the family’s home.
Sundance, of course, is not just for veteran screenwriters. Alexandre Moors makes his big screen debut as a writer-director in Blue Caprice, a psychological thriller about a boy lured to the U.S. and into the arms of a dangerous father figure. Inspired by real-life events, the film examines the infamous and terrifying Beltway sniper attacks from the point of view of the shooters, whose bizarre relationship expedited their journey across America. Blue Caprice documents the factors that influence its subjects to embrace physical violence.
Films centered on strange relationships, such as screenwriter Hannah Fidell’s second feature film, A Teacher, is a topic not uncommon at Sundance. In the film, Diana (Lindsay Burdge), a young and well-liked teacher, is having trouble following the status quo when she finds herself entering into a secret affair with her student Eric (Will Brittain). Even when the relationship is threatened by the suspicion of others, she is too invested in the sexual fantasy to accept the illegality of her actions. As Diana habitually avoids responsibility in the adult world, her life begins to spiral out of control. Though the issue of teacher-student sexual relations is not unfamiliar to the media and the public, Fidell resists any urge to exploit or pathologize her protagonist.
Some films are more lighthearted than others. Screenwriter Chad Hartigan’s This is Martin Bonner is a story about friendship, human connections and second chances at life. Middle-aged Martin Bonner  (Paul Eenhoorn) leaves his past behind and moves to Reno, where he begins work helping parolees adapt to life outside prison while experimenting with speed-dating and spending his weekends as a soccer referee. Meanwhile, Travis Holloway (Richmond Arquette) forms an unlikely friendship that provides both of them with understanding and encouragement.
To round out this eclectic selection of films there is also British director Ben Wheatley’s Sightseers. In the film, Chris (Steve Oram) wants to show Tina (Alice Lowe) his world on a journey through the British Isles. Tina has led a sheltered life and there are things that Chris needs her to see, but it doesn’t take long for his dream to fall apart. Litterbugs, obnoxious teenagers and Tina’s nosy mother send Chris — and anyone who gets in his way — over the edge.
Whether you’re an aspiring filmmaker or a film fanatic, the 2013 Sundance Film Festival has something for everyone’s cinematic interests. For the many fellow Trojans unable to hop on a plane to Utah on a moment’s notice, fear not. It’s only a matter of time before these exciting new feature films come to a theater near you.

For the women of Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority, Incorporated (AKA), the 105th anniversary of their sisterhood is a time to reflect on the women before them and to take a moment to celebrate their friendship.
“To be a part of an organization that has been around for so long means to be a part of a truly dynamic legacy that consists of remarkable women with genuine passion to create social change by having service to others as a top priority in their everyday lives,” said Victoria Willingham, a senior with a double major in psychology and Spanish and current AKA President.

AKA, the first Greek-letter collegiate group to be founded by African-American women, began at Howard University on January 15, 1908. Such esteemed women as Rosa Parks, Maya Angelou, Coretta Scott King and Alicia Keys are all honorary members of AKA. Today, there are 403 undergraduate and 556 graduate chapters, including at the University of Southern California, which has felt the presence of AKA since 1922 when a citywide chapter was opened. AKA was the first black sorority on the USC campus, and the current chapter, Iota Beta, was chartered in 1974.
“It’s amazing to think that when AKA was first chartered at USC, there were so many black women receiving a higher education. It’s all really inspiring,” said Jade Fleury, a senior majoring in communication who is the current treasurer of Iota Beta.
The women of this sorority are constantly inspired by the strength of the women who started their sisterhood. In 1908, very few Americans had college educations, and an even fewer percentage of them were African-American females. It was only 47 years after the American Civil War, and the nine founders felt they wanted to make sure their college career was as meaningful as possible.
“It began during a time when women of color had few rights in America. Women of color weren’t seen as worthy, attractive and intelligent individuals by the masses of people in this country, and our founders were committed to being examples and proof that women of color can do anything they put their mind to in this country,” Fleury said.
One reason for the incredible strength of this legacy is the presence of graduated members. Unlike many other sororities at USC, Alpha Kappa Alpha is not restricted to undergraduate students, and many women remain active members for life.
Lita Mallett, a senior majoring in biomedical engineering, echoed this sentiment: “When you become a woman of Alpha Kappa Alpha, you are pledging to be of service to all mankind for a lifetime, which is why I plan to remain active in the sorority even after I graduate.”
Service is an important aspect of membership to AKA and has been since its founding. One of their biggest annual events is a prom dress drive for local low-income teens, which led them to recently receive the “Most Meaningful Service” award from the National Pan-Hellenic Council, of which AKA is a member.
The five members of AKA at USC work to keep the efforts of their founders alive through service and scholarship.
“They were teachers, scholars, activist and athletes, while still dedicating their lives to sisterhood, scholarship and service to all mankind. They are a constant reminder to me that I can and must achieve my goals, and that I must leave my positive mark on society. They inspire me to be the woman I can be and change the world,” Fleury explained.
“There is a such a string legacy of sisterhood scholarship and service that I am honored to be a part of. I still can’t believe it till this day, and cry when I think about the lifelong sisterhood that I have entered,” Mallett said.
To commemorate this year’s monumental Founder’s Day, the Iota Beta members of AKA plan to spend a quiet evening relaxing and spending time together as sisters. Though they pride on service, scholarship and leadership, sisterhood is the core source of bonding for AKA members. In the end, it is why they are all together.
Willingham summarized her commitment to AKA as, “It’s such a blessing to be a part of such a rich history and legacy. It keeps me on my toes, because I am surrounded by 105 years worth of extraordinary women. But on a more intimate level, being a part  of this chapter has given me the love and support I needed to get me through any obstacle. I love my sisters. I support them. We drive each other crazy sometimes, but AKA really is like a home away from home.”
Thank you for recognizing Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority, Inc., on its 105th (um, not 150th) birthday! :-) 150 years ago would land our founding just after the start of the Civil War in 1862–wouldn’t that be a hoot for a black sorority!
Thanks for making the change!

While many undergraduate students search for a path on which to travel, some talented and dedicated individuals are lucky enough to have found their passion and are seeing their aspirations become reality. Brandon Combs and Devon Eisenbarger are two such lucky individuals who, on Dec. 10, performed on stage at the American Country Awards with renowned country music artist Keith Urban.

The opportunity first arose for these up-and-coming musicians due to their participation in a week-long summer program for high school musicians held here at USC called Grammy Camp, which is a subset of the Grammy in the Schools program. Urban, being a supporter of the Grammy Foundation’s efforts to bring music to youth, decided to invite a group of Grammy Camp alumni to play with him on stage.
“This was my first opportunity playing with someone of Keith’s caliber,” Eisenbarger said. “I was really quite nervous leading up to the show … Once I was actually up there performing, despite the thousands of people watching, I felt very at home.”
Her feeling of security was obvious as Urban and the Grammy Camp alumni performed Lynyrd Skynyrd’s “Crossroads.” One got the impression that this performance was completely organic — there were neither choreographed dance moves nor elaborate costumes. Eisenbarger, Combs and everyone on that stage looked as if they could have been playing in front of fifty people at a bar or in a friend’s basement.
One aspect of playing guitar that Eisenbarger’s especially loves is the ability to have fun rocking out and performing on stage because of the instrument’s ability to make songs come to life. During the performance, Eisenbarger had a solo in which both of those facets were clearly portrayed: Her energy and the way she interacted with Urban and the other performers proved that she was no sack of nerves, but rather was enjoying every minute of the experience. The audience also got the impression that even though she was playing a song written 30 years ago, there was still a way for her to make it her own and add her distinct passion into the performance.
For someone like Eisenbarger, experiences like these are what reinforce her future goals.
“In five or 10 years I see myself performing and writing music full-time … I was so in love with this whole experience of being at the show, of playing on a huge stage in front of tons of people and of being surrounded by so many talented artists and musicians gave me that much more belief and confidence in following music as my career.”
A standout regret from her performance with Urban was that she didn’t have the opportunity to ask him questions about his career and any advice he may have had for the budding artist. With a résumé and talent like Eisenbarger’s, this will definitely not be her last opportunity to play with a high-caliber musician.

Citizens have the responsibility to intervene in other countries in order to ensure rights for all. 
Amy Hsieh | Daily Trojan
On Jan. 9, the Saudi Arabian government beheaded Nafeek for allegedly murdering the infant she was caring for. The verdict was seemingly determined based on biased evidence; they also gave her no conventional due process. Moreover, she only had limited access to a lawyer and no translator, according to ABC News. Now the world will never know whether or not she truly strangled the small boy or if the infant had choked on his milk because the Saudi Arabian government essentially decided the ruling before any trial could begin.
Researchers at non-governmental organizations such as Human Rights Watch, representatives of the European Union and the Secretary General of the United Nations have all verbally condemned Saudi Arabia’s actions. But harsh words cannot spark corrective measures because they seem to have little to no effect on the international community. Verbal condemnation rarely persuades a government to act appropriately. Syria, North Korea and China have all received criticism for inhumane treatment of people in the past, but have not changed their justice systems.
To some, Nafeek is just one person. But when Saudi Arabia currently holds 50 other maids on death row, it is clear that the world must wake up and confront governments that perpetuate injustice. In the past, the U.S. has employed economic sanctions against China following gross human rights violations, such as the Tiananmen massacre. Yet the Peterson Institute for International Economics notes that economic sanctions, though usually effective, are not very common. Thus, further utilizing this measure is necessary in coercing these nations into acting in accordance with international norms that emphasize fair judicial processes.
The world has failed to conduct humanitarian interventions where millions have died. The merciless governments of Rwanda, Darfur and the Democratic Republic of Congo are just a few of those that have slaughtered innocent persons. The international community barely blinked at their actions because they had no personal investments in these areas.
Admittedly, intervention requires the use of resources. Governments are wary of contributing aid for the purpose of stopping crimes in other regions because it might not appear to be their problem. Yet discarding this selfish approach to handling the world’s tribulations could rid our planet of unnecessary bloodshed. If the international community prioritized valuing all lives instead of valuing just some, change would come.
America prides itself on providing equality and opportunity for its people. But how can its citizens watch silently as other human beings are denied their basic rights?
Satinah binti Jumadi Ahmad. Siti Zaenab. Tuti Tursilawati binti Warjuki. Darmawati binti Taryani. Siti Aminah.
The International Business Times reports these names are just few of the women currently on Saudi Arabia’s death row without access to a fair legal process. If the United States and the international community does not act now, more blood will spill.
In the end, Americans have the duty to ensure a fair justice system for fellow citizens around the globe. To simply ignore injustice would be to accept the principle of ending up in Nafeek’s situation, with the truth silenced and with no one to speak up for them.
Rini Sampath is a freshman majoring in international relations. 
 
The American government cannot waste time and resources attacking systems different from our own. 
Of course, this standard should not apply to such atrocities as genocide or devastating international wars, where intervention is vital for the world’s benefit. In extreme cases, one does need to stand up and fight for others, even if it does not concern them.
But every time that a non-U.S. citizen or resident falls into trouble outside of our borders, the government cannot immediately put everything down and go save him or her. For Rizana Nafeek, the Sri Lankan government did everything that it could but, unfortunately, its influence could not help.
Making the situation even more sensitive is that fact that U.S. relations in the Middle East have been in a tricky limbo for decades. By butting our heads into an issue that does not concern us, we would only be poking the beast more, with no assurance that our intervention will have a lasting positive impact.
Just because we are American does not mean that we always know what is right. But more importantly, just because we are American does not mean that we can tell other governments how to lead their countries. Our duty is to protect our citizens first and foremost, and by attempting to interfere in other governments, we would only be endangering the welfare of our own.
Sheridan Watson is a junior majoring in critical studies. She is also the Editorial Director of the Daily Trojan. 
It may not & should not be entirely up to US, yes, well accepted. But definitely UN (United Nations) should more actively intervene certain cases, i.e. they should have spine to question the whole trail proceedings which led to that gruesome beheading of the young woman last week in Saudi Arabia, despite not having any conclusive evidence what so ever. Just issuing a media statement condemning the act would not be sufficient at all. A government/regime accepted by UN should answer to UN, they shouldn’t be allowed to merely escape from this mentioning its one of their internal affairs & just condemning the poor already murdered accused without any proven facts. If UN don’t wish to question this now, I’m not sure what are they waiting for or for whom they are waiting for to intervene & question this gruesome, callous, selfish, mindless act done in the name of their said creator Allah. Some utter irresponsibility is seen in the response from the Saud Arabian government/regime (see below given links, there may be hundreds of other sources on web) condemning the international criticism over the act they committed last week, may be they are expecting the international community to produce the appeal before their said creator Allah, in this 21st century… This had been a gruesome killing done by a legal system belonging to a UN-accepted regime, so they should answer how they had come to the conclusion that the accused had actually committed the crime, how can they run a murder trial without even conducting any postmortem in this 21st century, without any proper translator/interpreter while the entire court proceedings are carried out in Arabic; a language the accused doesn’t properly understand to handle in a tricky situation like this, no proper unbiased legal assistance/lawyer for the accused, basically nothing for her defense in this virtually unknown environment to her having landed in Saudi only a couple of weeks back when the whole drama began in mid 2005.
See below the response from Saudi.
Is UN having any plans or spine to question this entire drama ?. In the name of humanity, they should.
