The end of regular season play is nearing for the No. 4 USC women’s water polo team, as it hosts No. 7 San Jose State on Saturday at 4 p.m.
The home game is the team’s final contest before the Mountain Pacific Sports Federation tournament begins.
Leadership · With a larger number of underclassmen on USC’s roster, senior Joelle Bekhazi has been a stabilizing force for the Women of Troy. - Daily Trojan file photo 
Last week, USC (15-5, 3-3) suffered a devastating loss to crosstown rival and then-No. 4 UCLA. It is the first time since 2000 that they have lost three times in MPSF play. Saturday’s outcome will give the Women of Troy either the No. 4 or No. 5 seed heading into the conference tournament.
With 20 wins this season, the visiting Spartans (20-9, 2-3) pose several challenges for the Women of Troy, but they have never won a game against USC, who won last season’s meeting 13-6.
The contest will also be the last home game for four seniors: driver Joelle Bekhazi, two-meter Kristen Dronberger, goalie Courtney Ray and two-meter Sarah Van Norman.
Of the four, Bekhazi and Dronberger have both scored their 100th career goals this season. Bekhazi has 121, while Dronberger has 113. Both are looking to score enough goals in their upcoming matches to make their way into the all time top 10.
“It’s an exciting feeling being a senior and knowing all the accomplishments we’ve done as a team in this pool in front of our families and friends,” Bekhazi said. “It’s also sad to know this will be the last time the seniors will be playing with USC in our own pool, but I’m confident we will go out with a bang.”
USC will rely heavily on its collection of seniors, but a balanced attack has been the team’s calling card this season. Through 20 games, the Women of Troy have had 16 different scorers.
Many of the team’s younger players will be expected to step up again, particularly sophomore two-meter Patricia Jancso and sophomore driver Dominique Sardo, each  of who was instrumental in USC’s NCAA championship run last season. Others, such as freshman two-meter Madeline Rosenthal, will need to make a positive impact as well.

Big 12 reaches TV deal with Fox Sports
A year after nearly losing his conference’s premier powerhouses, Oklahoma and Texas, to the Pac-10, Big 12 commissioner Dan Beebe secured a 13-year cable TV deal with Fox Sports for the now-10-team conference.
Financial terms were not disclosed, but the Sports Business Journal reported the contract, beginning with the 2012 football season, is worth an estimated $90 million per year.
“This landmark agreement positions the Conference with one of the best television arrangements in collegiate sports,” Beebe said at a press conference. “It exceeds the benchmarks as we move forward with our 10 members by providing significant revenue growth and increased exposure while allowing institutions to retain selected rights.”
Under its new agreement, all Big 12 home football games will air on ABC/ESPN, a Fox network (either FX or Fox Sports) or a school’s own station such as Texas’ new “Longhorn Network.” Schools have the option to retain the rights to one home game per season with the opportunity to broadcast it on its own network.
The Big 12 also has a deal with ABC/ESPN expected to run through the 2015-2016.
By comparison, the SEC generated $205 million in revenue through its TV agreements this year, while the Big Ten produced $220 million. The soon-to-be Pac-12, however, made just $60 million.
New Pac-12 commissioner Larry Scott is in the midst of negotiating a new television contract.

Four-star spurns USC for Texas Tech
Four-star defensive tackle Delvon Simmons (McKeesport, Pa.) signed a letter of intent with Texas Tech on Thursday, according to multiple media reports.
Simmons, who originally signed a LOI with North Carolina on Feb. 2, listed USC, along with Pittsburgh, as a finalist before agreeing to join the Red Raiders.
“Delvon has the ability to be a difference-maker in our program,” Texas Tech coach Tommy Tuberville said in a statement. “He is an explosive and disruptive player and an outstanding athlete. We are thrilled to have him.”
The 6-foot-5 prospect was released from his LOI with the Tar Heels when defensive line coach Brian Baker bolted for the NFL’s Dallas Cowboys.
Ranked as a top-five defensive tackle by both Scout.com and Yahoo! Sports’ Rivals.com, Simmons is also a member of the 2011 Rivals100 list as one of the top 100 players nationally.

USC-Pepperdine rescheduled
USC baseball’s suspended game with Pepperdine will be completed May 24, prior to an originally scheduled game between the two teams at Dedeaux Field.
Last Tuesday’s game against the Waves was originally suspended because of darkness, with the score tied 5-5 going into the top of the 12th inning. Pepperdine’s Eddy D. Field Stadium does not have lights.
The Trojans and Waves had a game originally scheduled for 3 p.m. at Dedeaux Field to complete the would-be home-and-home. Now, the teams will complete the suspended game, with Pepperdine as the home team. Thirty minutes after completion, they will start the originally scheduled game with USC as the home team.

In its regular season finale at Marks Stadium, the USC women’s tennis team looks to exact revenge on a UCLA squad that handed it a 5-2 loss earlier in the year.
Coming off a 4-3 win at Pepperdine, the No. 6 Bruins (17-5, 6-1) have vaulted themselves into the top-10. The last time USC (14-6, 4-3) faced them, the Bruins were ranked No. 17.
As with any matchup against UCLA, there is added incentive and pressure to perform well, something the coaching staff is well aware of.
“With our seniors playing their last home match, I always worry about emotions staying in check,” said USC coach Richard Gallien. “If we can start off even keel and just get into a tough wrestling match, I believe we have every chance to win.”
Following a loss last week to Arizona State’s Kelcy McKenna, senior Maria Sanchez once again faces a tough match against No. 60 McCall Jones. Although Jones has struggled lately, going 5-5 in her last 10 matches, the BYU transfer took Sanchez to a second-set tiebreaker in their previous matchup.
Freshman Kaitlyn Christian will be back in action this week against UCLA, after injuring herself during practice against Arizona State last weekend. Christian will square off against Andrea Remynse.
Although Christian lost the last time she played Remynse, she has matured into a strong force for USC, sitting at No. 124 nationally with a 23-8 record. With a 9-3 record in the third slot, Christian has become accustomed to seeing opposing team’s top competition.
Sophomore Danielle Lao, who currently ranks No. 21, is matched up against No. 43 Noelle Hickey, who defeated her 6-3, 6-3 in Westwood earlier in the year. Hickey is coming off a loss last week in Malibu.
Sophomore Valeria Pulido is  back at full health after fighting off injury the last few weeks. She will look to break a three-match skid against UCLA’s Pamela Montez, who took her down 6-3, 6-1 in their previous matchup.
Along with Sanchez, seniors Cristala Andrews and Lyndsay Kinstler will each get the start against the Bruins on Friday. Andrews will face 20-1 Carling Seguso on court six, while Kinstler will team with Danielle Lao to take on the doubles pair of Montez and Seguso in the third doubles spot.
First serve is at 3 p.m. at Marks Stadium.
