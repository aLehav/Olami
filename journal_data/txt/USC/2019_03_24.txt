Two weeks into Spring Football, it’s already clear that the Trojans will be doing things very differently this year. Looking to bounce back from their worst season in 19 years, head coach Clay Helton and his staff have are shaking things up across the board.
Former offensive coordinator Tee Martin has been replaced by former University of North Texas head coach Graham Harrell. Harrell brings with him the dynamic air-raid offense; a system that’s spread quickly across the college football landscape in recent years, yet has never appearing at USC until now. The Trojans have long maintained a traditional pro-style offense, built on deep drops from under center, long developing routes and multi-level reads. The air-raid, on the other hand, emphasizes stretching the field both horizontally and vertically, generally putting the quarterback in a shotgun alignment and allowing him to make quick and often simple reads. 
The shift to the air raid has been evident in almost every aspect of practice so far. There’s been an emphasis on letting the offense just run, even this early into training without the absorption of an entire pro-style playbook. Redshirt junior receiver Tyler Vaughns, now one of the team’s upperclassmen, commented on the benefits of that fact. 
“We’re getting more live reps which I like,” Vaughns said. “We’re getting more team reps and everything like that, so it’s really helping us as an offense.” 
The system encourages simplicity from players across the formation, allowing them to focus more directly on executing  individual tasks without needing to process the entirety of the play. Multiple players have mentioned that the simplicity of the air raid allows them to “play fast,” relieving them of the weight of processing too many moving parts during each play. That difference has shown on the field, with the offense running a surprisingly high number of offensive plays in practice for this early in the offseason.
Besides tangible changes to the team’s offensive strategy, there’s been a concerted effort to change elements of the team philosophy as a whole with toughness and discipline at its core. The team as realized it needs to work on accountability after a 2018 season that saw them average almost 14 penalties per game, and the coaching staff is determined not to let that happen again. 
There are now live referees  throwing flags on any penalties at every practice. It’s already seemed to have paid rapid dividends, as there’s been a noticeable drop in violations since the first day of practice. Whether or not it carries over to real games will remain to be seen, but it’s a promising start.
Although a two-week sample size isn’t much to work with, a number of players already seem to be ready to serve as key contributors for the upcoming season. Some are unsurprising — veteran receivers Tyler Vaughns and Michael Pittman, linebacker John Houston and defensive tackle Jay Tufele have all shown up to work, picking up from where they left off.
 Some of last year’s impact freshman also seem to be in their stride — linebacker Palaie Gaoteote has remained a standout and receiver Amon-Ra St. Brown has been as consistent as ever. Talanoa Hufanga had been looking even better at safety than he did last year, though an injury in Saturday’s practice makes his future status unclear. Hufanga had a fantastic freshman season until a collarbone injury took him out for the year. The same injury that seems to have been re-aggravated despite his non-contact designation in practice.
There are a handful of players who seem to have made strides from where they were last year and look poised to step up for the Trojans. Freshman defensive back Britton Allen has shown promise, offering impressive tenacity in the secondary with a penchant for stripping out the ball. Sophomore Devon Williams has been putting together his unique combination of top-end speed and incredible length at 6-foot-4 to become a dangerous receiving weapon. 
Two sophomores who played a very limited role last year have stepped up in these two weeks. Running back Markese Stepp, buried on the depth chart for most of last year, has been a force on the practice field. Stepp is a runaway freight train at 235 pounds, bulldozing defenders with regularity. With the sidelining of Stephen Carr and Vavae Malepeai to the flu, Stepp has received many first team reps and shown showing ability to catch the ball out of the backfield along with being a punishing runner.
On the other side of the ball, sophomore cornerback Isaac Taylor-Stuart missed most of last season due to injury after playing mostly special teams early in the year, never receiving an opportunity to play real game snaps on defense. Taylor-Stuart is tremendously gifted as an athlete, with blazing speed to go with his impressive frame of 6-foot-2, 205 pounds, but his lack of refined technique held him back in the early stages of his freshman year. However, he’s become one of the first-string corners and his continued improvement could be one of the most important factors in the success of the Trojan defense come fall.

The No. 11 Trojans defeated top-ranked defending national champion Long Beach State in a major upset Saturday night in front of a packed crowd at USC’s North Gym.
The Trojans (13-8) became the first team to take down the 49ers (19-1) this season, breaking their 23-game winning streak. The Trojans fell to Long Beach 3-1 earlier this season in January, and until last week when the 49ers played UC Santa Barbara, the Trojans had been the only team to take a set off Long Beach. 
Although this is a major victory for the Trojans, there is still plenty more that they want to accomplish this season. 
“Playing in this gym definitely gives us an advantage, but at the end of the day, it’s not a conference match,” redshirt senior outside hitter Jack Wyett said. “So in the grand scheme of things, it doesn’t give us that much of an advantage. We’re definitely not done with what we’re trying to complete. But if all things finish in the way that we expect them to, we’ll likely see them in the NCAA finals.”
Wyett and senior outside hitters Ryan Moss and Gianluca Grasso led the team offensively. Moss had a match-best 14 kills hitting .565; Wyett had 13 kills at .579; and Grasso added 10 kills at .500. 
Sophomore middle blocker Sam Lewis had four blocks and senior libero Matt Douglas had 9 digs, both match highs, to anchor the defense.
The Trojans led the entirety of the first set with Long Beach trailing closely behind. USC slowly started to pull ahead for a 25-21 set win. 
The Trojans started the second set with the same momentum as the first. Although the 49ers scored the first point, USC quickly recovered to put up a 7-2 lead after scoring 4 consecutive points. The Trojans took it away to win the second set 25-21.
USC’s energy only elevated going into the third set. Although it was a tight race at first, the Trojans quickly picked up a 9-4 lead and never looked back. The 49ers closed in on the Trojans’ lead multiple times, but never quite managed to catch up. USC won the match with a 25-17 set finish, leaving Long Beach with its lowest-scoring 25-point set since scoring 15 in a 3-0 loss to Penn State in 2015.
Leading the 49ers, senior pin hitter Kyle Ensing had nine kills and senior outside hitter TJ DeFalco added eight kills, five digs and 2 aces.. 
Wyett said serving and passing were the Trojans’ biggest strengths throughout the match.  
“Usually that’s how we’re taken out of games, and I thought we were really disciplined with that throughout the game and that’s what won the match,” Wyett said.
The Trojans remain at home this week to take on No. 9 Stanford and No. 8 Brigham Young in Mountain Pacific Sports Federation conference play. USC will face Stanford Friday at 7 p.m. before taking on BYU Saturday at 7 p.m. back on their usual home court at the Galen Center.

One of the first things I did after the college admissions scandal broke was think back to any previous correspondence I had with the highest-profile member implicated from USC: men’s and women’s water polo head coach Jovan Vavic. 
During my freshman year, I covered the men’s water polo team for the Daily Trojan and interviewed Vavic often. I thought back to these interactions to try and recall if there was ever anything suspect, anything that might have alluded to — even in the slightest of manners — the notion that he was secretly part of an illegal operation to admit students to USC by masquerading them as fake athletes. I could not. 
Evidently, neither could anyone else — not his bosses, his staff or his players. The outcry over the national scandal — and USC’s role in it, specifically — is, of course, warranted. The immediate termination of both Vavic and senior associate athletic director Donna Heinel was a welcome development, for their alleged activities not only violated the integrity of the college admissions process, but also was a punch in the face to all the other USC student-athletes who worked hard to earn a spot on a Division I team. 
I don’t really want to pile on the outcry. Last week’s Daily Trojan editorial board summed up the frustration around campus perfectly. But having covered Vavic’s numerous water polo triumphs, attended practices and watched him masterfully dissect opposing teams during games, it is so hard for me to connect this man, this water polo god, to the criminal activity he is charged with.
Make no mistake: Vavic is still water polo royalty. His bio on the USC Athletics website stretches so long with accolades that it requires five solid scroll-downs to reach the end: 16 national championships, 15-time national coach of the year, 25 years at the helm of both the men’s and women’s programs. For USC water polo, winning national championships is not just the norm — it’s expected. 
Observe Vavic for five minutes during a game and it’s not hard to discern his strengths as a coach: tough, loud and demanding. His practices, players say, were grueling. His teams were so stacked and dominant that they would often win games by 5, 10, 15 goals. Even with an insurmountable lead late in those games, he would scorch his players with his piercing, gruff yell, audible to anyone within earshot of the pool: “PRESS! PRESS! WHAT ARE YOU DOING?!” 
Interviewing Vavic was nerve-wracking as a freshman beat writer. He gave short, terse answers in his Slavic accent. After some games, he would run off and the sports information director would come back empty-handed, forcing me to write a recap without quotes from the coach. 
But I respected him. His players did, too. He ran a tight ship. He had no time for BS. He built a dynasty from the ground up. He was the kind of coach, the kind of leader who rarely did not get what he wanted. At a women’s water polo game last month against Indiana in which USC won 19-1, I watched from across the pool as Vavic, sunglasses on, leaned back in his chair and basked in the rout that his team was putting on. I recalled thinking to myself, “That is a man at the pinnacle of his profession.”
I could have never imagined that, weeks later, he would be booked into a jail at 7 a.m. in Hawaii as he was preparing to coach the women’s team in a tournament, charged with conspiracy to commit racketeering. And the only question I have is: Why? 
Why did he do it? Why did Vavic, with a pedigree in water polo akin to that of John Wooden’s in basketball, risk it all? Was it for the $250,000 and private-school tuition payments for his children that he is alleged to have received, despite the fact that he assuredly has made enough to live comfortably? Was it just because he could? 
Whatever Vavic’s answer is will not be satisfactory, because there is no good answer to why anyone in his position would commit such a crime. If true, his actions were offensive and disrespectful — to the hundreds of players he coached who made the roster on their own merits, disrespectful to the students denied a spot at USC because of the fake recruits he put on his team, disrespectful to the integrity of admissions, of athletics, of … well, everything in the name of the basic dignity that we hope leaders like Vavic possess. That, apparently, was too much to ask. 
It has been difficult to contextualize the version of Vavic, the stern but colorful and legendary coach whom I respected, with what the allegations have revealed about his actual identity: a deceitful man who took advantage of his position of power. And there is absolutely nothing legendary or respectable about that. Eric He is a senior writing about current events in sports. He is also the features editor of the Daily Trojan.

Right now, hit singles are all the rage — from Ariana Grande’s iconic, rebellious “Thank U, Next” to smash hits like “Bodak Yellow” and “Despacito.” People seem to always be on the lookout for the next summer anthem and whatever No. 1 single Drake’s next album will bring. And though everyone checks in to the Grammys each year to pretend they care about the Album of the Year winner, the album format has clearly taken a backseat to singles.
New technologies are largely responsible for this trend. Social platforms constantly inundate people with information and have reduced collective attention spans to paltry numbers. Most of the time, it seems as though society cannot pay attention to anything for prolonged periods of time. 
Streaming — and playlisting in particular — are the cherry on top. Playlists have placed a heavy emphasis on individual tracks; they stress the songs that will get you moving in the gym, the songs to clean your room to and the songs to have sex to, but there is little attention given to whole bodies of work put out by musicians. For this reason, many artists commission producers to create songs specifically for the purpose of being “streamable.” Loud, attention-grabbing tracks with short intros and quick choruses are becoming focal points for the music industry as music production becomes more disposable to the public.
All of this makes me wonder: What will happen to albums? What does this mean for the future of the long-play format? Sure, there are some artists who still place emphasis on an entire body of work. Grande just released the album of her career with “Thank U, Next,” and each of Beyoncé, Jay-Z, Kanye West and Taylor Swift’s releases is widely anticipated. But albums are now typically treated as something music fans can order from musicians like menus at drive-throughs. 
An easy way to keep LPs from dying would be including them as part of merchandise and ticket packages. Essentially, the artist would include an album as part of a merchandise sale or the sale of a concert ticket. Not only does this inflate album sales (thus, raising chart positions), but it also increases revenue from merch and live events.
Travis Scott recently employed this tactic for his latest album “Astroworld.” Scott released an exclusive merch collection and bundled each purchase with a digital copy of the LP, which generated enough sales in the album’s first week to push it to No. 1 on the Billboard Top 200. Taylor Swift did something similar in 2017 for her Reputation Stadium Tour, which sold out and boosted her album sales.
Interestingly enough, streaming platforms present opportunities for keeping albums fresh as well. Since everything is digital, nothing is set in stone, and artists are able to treat each album as if it is a living entity; the content is much more malleable than it would be in physical formats. 
In this case, musical releases are allowed to grow and evolve. An upbeat three-minute track with catchy choruses can transform into a slow and solemn five-minute ballad, yet retain its original name. Kanye West has done this multiple times now, most notably in his 2016 album “The Life of Pablo;” each alteration of the track listing was treated as a different iteration of the project as a whole, and this kept fans coming back for more.
But the popularity of streaming begs another question: Why have artists stopped doing deluxe editions of their albums? Now, more than ever, is the perfect time to diversify discography across platforms. Currently, streaming services do not require content to be the same for each interface, so musicians are technically able to release different versions of their work across all of the digital service providers. Fans are granted the excitement of chasing down every possible version of their favorite musician’s latest release, and artists can be comfortable in knowing that their fans are engaged with their work beyond just a hit single.
This would also be an opening for a return to the (very loathed) practice of releasing exclusive albums on streaming services. Many people may dislike when a new album is only available on a particular platform, but it is a very smart move on the artist’s part. This strategy pigeonholes the casual fan into either paying for a music streaming service — thereby granting the artist more royalties from streams — or buying the entire album outright, which is obviously the most lucrative outcome for the musician. To this day, Beyoncé’s “LEMONADE” is still only streamable on TIDAL, but fans can (read: are required to) purchase the album anywhere else. Because of this, Beyoncé’s first week was one of the highest of 2016 and of her entire career. 
As far as physical albums go, the industry will have a major opportunity for revival by the mid-2020s. As  millennials age, their nostalgia will grow. Thus, CDs are going to see a comeback in the same way vinyl records have — a move that can help keep albums afloat.
Labels could use new forms of technology to make CD packaging incredibly interactive; perhaps augmented reality is incorporated into the booklets or QR codes send fans to special websites. 
Labels can also sell physical CDs at select locations, or different versions across different retailers. This method has already been used myriad times, and is still being done by some artists (Taylor Swift’s “Reputation” magazine being sold at Target alongside special versions of the album). Nonetheless, this would bring back the essence of lining up outside of a store for a release, and fans would be more inclined to have good receptions to the experience and the music. 
Hit singles have always been a cornerstone of importance for the music business, and that will likely remain the same. What is troubling, though, is that major event albums — bodies of work that are meant to display an artist’s growth, give fans a peek into a musician’s life and create cultural discussion — are becoming overshadowed by one-off tracks. There are ways to exploit emerging technologies to remedy the problem, or at least make album sales resemble what they were in the previous decade, but the industry must be clever and act fast.

“Dull” is not a word in Jordan Peele’s lexicon. The concept of dullness appears to be foreign to him — indeed, his new film “Us” exemplifies this phenomenon. 
“Us” hits the ground running and doesn’t stop; even when the film actually does halt to (literally) catch its breath, it rarely disrupts its overall graceful pace. It grabs its audience and never lets go. Even in the post-credits, chances are most people will be trying to solve Peele’s puzzle for days to come. 
The bulk of the movie’s magnetism can certainly be attributed to its high-concept premise. A family on a beach vacation encounters another family that appears to be a twisted version of themselves; as the duplicate family sits confronts the real one, one chilling line heightens the tension and sets up the film’s greatest threat: “It’s us.”
The second family are mirror images of the original members with minds of their own — like Peter Pan’s rascal shadow gone berserk on its master.  
From the moment the strange family appears in the driveway, “Us” never looks back. Peele mixes horror with psychological thriller, slasher with haunted house. Constant tension and a methodically-revealed plot go hand-in-hand to fashion a gloriously grotesque experience that’s enthralling to watch and consider, especially after its backflip of a conclusion.
Creepy, draped in red jumpsuits and wielding (really, really sharp) scissors, the mysterious duplicates have veiled motivations that go beyond mindless killing. If Peele’s first feature “Get Out” had a problem with clunky exposition in its third act, “Us” is a slightly smoother step forward. Even when characters do take time to explain things to the audience, they don’t do it very straightforwardly — almost nothing in “Us” is spoonfed, which can be a turn-off to many viewers. Part of “Get Out’s” appeal is that it is incredibly smart but still accessible; viewers could revel in proudly saying “I get it.” 
That’s not the case at all in “Us.” As the credits roll, it becomes the audience’s job to come up with some answers; the clues are all there, it’s just a matter of paying closer attention next time. It’s a cheeky tactic, but it is impossible to watch “Us” and not mull over it when the credits start rolling. 
Even as writer and director, Peele is hardly the film’s only valuable player. None of it would work without two magnetic performances by Lupita Nyong’o. Playing both the real Adelaide Wilson and her doppelganger, Red, Nyong’o elevates every aspect of the film, from its psychological musings to its most terrifying sequences. Her Adelaide is visibly weighed down by anxiety and fear, but Red is so scary precisely because she never shows any inkling of fear — she is unfazed by everything after the horrors she has lived through. 
Moments of comedic levity sprinkled throughout are a reminder that Peele, a master of comedy, is behind the curtain pulling all the strings. Comparing this to “Get Out” is inevitable, and probably necessary to see in what direction Peele is headed as a filmmaker. The latter is more subtle about its intentions so it’s a hint more satisfying (and terrifying) when everything wraps up nicely, but the former is arguably more intriguing even as it complicates its deepest truths. Both films will surely remain in the public consciousness through YouTube video essays and endless Reddit threads as subsequent viewings will reveal how dense each is — abounding with set-ups and pay-offs, subtle but poignant social commentary and, as all horror does, revealing that what we fear says a lot more about us than we think.

Hundreds of students descended onto McCarthy Quad Saturday for this year’s edition of GearFest. From Southern comfort food courtesy of Granny’s Kitchen to on-site haircuts provided by Questcutz, GearFest was all about embracing black art and culture.
Sponsored by the USC Black Student Assembly and BSA Creative Experience, this year’s event celebrated the different strokes that black people and creatives come in. This theme was evident throughout the event, as student musical performances ranged from emotionally gripping vocal displays to mosh-inducing rap sets. Excluding a few acts, most of the festival’s performers and artistic contributors were USC students. 
GearFest kicked off with an energetic, colorful performance by dance group Syann. The group’s dynamic performance foreshadowed the talent and charisma that each individual artist would bring to the stage throughout the festival. 
As the first singers to perform, USC students Zoe Rosemond, Ayoni Thompson and Amir Kelly set the tone for GearFest. The three acts served as an emotional introduction to the event, with each act building off its predecessor. The artists performed a combination of original unreleased tracks and covers of classics, drawing the audience closer to the stage with each new song.
After Kelly’s mesmerizing performance of his debut single “Maui” concluded the singing portion of GearFest, singer Bran Movay met the engaged audience with a lighthearted energy and put everyone in the mood to dance. DJ A la Mode handled that urge as he transitioned from classics like Lil Mama’s “Lip Gloss” to a compilation of Caribbean beats. 
In between musical performances, “Death of Cool” put on a fashion show to display another facet of artistic talent within the University’s black student community. Handmade hair care products by students also lined the perimeter of the festival, which students could purchase.
The event’s hosts, juniors Marquia McKnight and David Friebe, smoothly transitioned from set to set, engaging with the audience on multiple occasions to ask fun, sarcastic questions such as, “Is cereal a soup?” and “Is water wet?” When the charismatic duo wasn’t testing the audience, they were stressing the importance of the event.
“GearFest is for the culture,” Friebe said. “This is for us, by us.”
That sense of black student community was especially strong as GearFest honored the life of student Victor McElhaney, a senior who died over spring break. Students participated in moments of silences and held memorial performances in McElhaney’s honor.
Come sunset, GearFest’s energy had shifted dramatically as the crowd’s excitement boiled with the ensuing hip-hop performances. 
With a cover of J.I.D’s “Off Deez” and a performance of a few crowd favorite originals, Clarence The Kid amped the energy up another notch. After his set, freshman rapper 24kGoldn, the youngest performer at 18 years old, took the stage. Despite a short three-song set, 24kGoldn generated the most energy of the six-hour event as his hit song “Valentino” reverberated through McCarthy Quad.
Headliner YBN Nahmir served as an apt closing act to the evening. The rapper’s energy was contagious, and he and closed the event on a high note with a performance of “Bounce Out With That.” 
Overall, GearFest successfully illustrated the diverse, vibrant nature of the black community that exists within USC. With creative displays of culture and attention-grabbing performances, BSA and Creative Experience curated an engaging experience for all.

Every year, USC students hear about how the University’s endowment continues to grow. According to USC’s 2018 financial Report, accumulated endowment investment returns spent on operations increased 3.9 percent from the previous year.  However, many are concerned as to why tuition continues to increase despite the growing endowment. Since the 2014-15 academic year, tuition has increased by over $7,000. And just last week, USC announced a 3.5 percent increase for the upcoming year. 
Furthermore, under former USC president C.L. Max Nikias, in 2017 the University announced that it raised $6 billion, almost 18 months ahead of schedule. Endowment generally gives an institution the ability to grow, remaining as a permanent source of funding through its projected investment incomes. However, focus on areas like dining, recreational facilities and housing needs to be heightened — very little has changed in the past few years, especially in comparison to other elite institutions.
According to USC’s 2017 financial report, “The endowment exists to support the academic mission of the University for current and future generations of Trojans.” But it’s hard to support students academically if basic needs like nutrition are not met. USC continues to fall behind comparable institutions, and funding from increased tuition and USC’s endowment could go to improving available resources like student dining. 
For instance, USC’s funds should be allocated to increasing food diversity and providing more options for vegetarians and vegans. Funds could also be used to instate activity-level monitoring, as done at UCLA and UCSB, to analyze what foods USC students are eating to make informed decisions on how to minimize waste and better satisfy student needs. Funds could be directed toward wages for USC dining staff so that opening hours are extended to accommodate students with varying schedules.
USC needs to allocate funds to improving student living conditions as well. On-campus dorms lack basic amenities from furnishing to air conditioning — not to mention that some spring admits have been forced to live in converted lounges. Students who choose dorm-style living are forced to live without air conditioning in various freshman residential halls and undergraduate housing like Parkside Apartments — this can take a toll on their physical comfort in extreme temperatures. USC Housing must direct funds toward bettering the housing experience for the thousands of students it serves. A ductless air conditioner, for example, costs about $600, meaning that the entirety of Trojan Hall could likely be retrofitted with air-conditioning for approximately $70,000 — an addition that would considerably improve daily life.
It is understandable that comfort and quality of student housing might not be one of the University’s priorities. As a large institution, there are many areas to which USC directs its endowment funds, but at its core, USC aims to serve its students and by approaching endowments with student interests in mind, the University can truly drive itself into its next era. 
Although rising inflation and increased managing costs across the United States have caused a majority of universities to raise tuition, many elite institutions have additionally chosen to use their endowment funds to lower tuition rates for students and families most affected by these increases. Even though USC administers the largest undergraduate financial aid program in the U.S., according to The Campaign for USC, the University still does not guarantee free or heavily discounted tuition to students in lower-income brackets. 
In 2015, for example, Stanford University announced that students from families earning less than $125,000 annually would not have to pay tuition. However, Stanford does benefit from a $26.5 billion endowment — more than quadruple USC’s.
Only 2.2 percent of undergraduate scholarship aid is provided through endowment. Because students are forced to pay more, they deserve to gain more benefits from their USC experience, whether that means improving daily resources or increasing access to secondary education. 
Regardless, increasing access is one of the most important things USC can do to “welcome outstanding men and women of every race, creed and background,” the University’s mission statement reads.
As the University continues to grow, those in charge of endowment funds must consider student interests while continuing to follow the most crucial tenets of USC’s mission statement. With the tens of millions of dollars available to the University, a small portion should certainly be reasonably diverted to benefit current students, even as expanding the financial aid pool is an effective use of the funds. Striking a proper balance between the two is crucial for USC’s donors and administration, effectively setting the guidelines for the University’s role as an institution.

USC Village is an eyesore. On its own, it is a formidable work of Collegiate Gothic architecture, the red bricks generating a false sense of rich history. But when it was built in the sprawl of South Los Angeles, it interrupted years of cultural history and injected its own architectural pretense without input from its neighbors. What’s more, its planning also isolates the USC community from that of South L.A., with very few even noticing.
USC’s architecture and design fail to integrate the University into its surrounding community. South L.A. residents may have few reasons to enter the University Park Campus, but USC should not use this assumption as justification for the gaps in its planning efforts. 
And there are plenty of examples of this poor planning. Think beyond the high level of after-hours security — consider why a black fence runs all along Exposition Boulevard. Why is there a dearth of open park space, greenery along the edges of campus for public use and a logical mirror to Exposition Park Rose Garden? Why is there insufficient public parking, despite numerous museums and landmarks surrounding USC?
The whole University is a large project to tackle, so let’s start with USC Village, a microcosm of city life. At USC Village’s grand opening, former USC president C. L. Max Nikias said a, “We built this village to show our enduring commitment to our exceptional students and our beloved neighbors.” He espoused the value of community, insisting that USC Village would strengthen ties between the students and the community.
Don’t get me wrong, some of USC Village’s design is good. Within its gates, inner community-oriented design abounds. Its construction opened the intersections of Jefferson Boulevard and Hoover Street and Jefferson Boulevard and McClintock Avenue to more pedestrian access. This correlates to the thumb rule of urban planning: Create with purpose, create for use. USC Village capitalizes on use of open space well — students gather under umbrellas at the rows of tables and sit around the fountain, a strategic noise design to avoid a vacuum of silence at the heart of USC Village. 
But its design fails to welcome outside community members and discourages students from venturing beyond the confines of the black fence. USC Village’s primary access points are both on the south side, connecting back to UPC. There are no directional signs pointing toward the very near Metro stop or LADOT Downtown Dash to encourage use of public transit to places other than USC. The buildings are also arranged in a tightly bound enclosure — they stand tall, blocking the outside from the center, rather than creating open, communal space at the edges or a looser circle of buildings.
These observations do not even touch on the shops that comprise USC Village’s retail spaces. Quite frankly, USC Village is the embodiment of gentrification. Local residents were evicted to create more student residences. Pricier retail shops dissuade community members from shopping at USC Village. And everything students could want is there — they no longer have a reason to venture to Target at the FIGat7th, less than three miles away, or walk down Vermont Avenue to grab a plate of tacos.
Longtime resident-owned businesses like Lil Bill’s Bike Shop would have loved the opportunity to stay within the USC vicinity, but were not offered spaces. The only store USC retained from the previous shopping center that occupied its space is the Village Cobbler. 
While the University claims it values community, its planning only considers the community within its walls; USC’s layout and construction have created barriers between students and locals. 
As former Los Angeles Times architectural critic Christopher Hawthorne put it, “The Village is part of an explicit effort by USC to reach out to and engage with the city itself, not build an oasis from it. The contradiction between that effort and the architecture of the complex is basic and striking.” For all its outreach and employment programs for local residents, USC’s planning reflects its minimal effort to include and promote community with its neighbors. USC Village is an outreach effort that failed to fully deliver. If the University plans to expand any more, it needs to consider planning for inclusivity of South L.A. residents and promoting community not only among its student body, but to the surrounding area as well.

USC Concerts Committee is organizing Post-Fest, the first-ever official after-party to Springfest, which will take place at Free Play, a bar in Exposition Park on March 30. The event will serve alcohol and admit students ages 18 and up, according to the official Facebook event page. 
“The Post-Fest is kind of like a place for you to go after Springfest if you don’t want to turn in for the evening,” said Concerts Committee Director Kira Stiers, a senior majoring in international relations and political science. “Our shows end kind of early … and a lot of kids like to go out afterward.”  
Post-Fest will include a DJ, arcade with classic games, complimentary snacks and drinks and cocktails and beers for purchase. Though the event will admit students 18 and over, they will be required to show ID to purchase alcoholic beverages. 
“If you’re not 21, a lot of the bars around here you can’t get into,” Stiers said. “I think it’s great that [Post-Fest] is all ages; we want people to have options other than just going back to their apartment or heading back to their dorm if they’re under 21.”  
In an email to the Daily Trojan, Free Play addressed concerns regarding the presence of alcohol at Post-Fest.
“We will double our security personnel for the evening to help prevent and monitor potential underage drinking, as well as ensure that the venue is safe for all students,” Free Play wrote. “We have doubled our staff and operations team for the evening to help promote safe conduct, monitor all guests activity and ensure all students are in a safe environment.” 
Stiers said the committee works closely with the Department of Public Safety, Contemporary Services Corporation and Apex -— a crowd management and security company — to ensure the event is safe for all students. 
Some students said they anticipate the after-party will be a success.
“I’d expect a lot of party people to go [to Post-Fest],” said Joel Jimenez, a freshman majoring in industrial and systems engineering. “We’re a party school.” 
Free Play wrote that it will offer other amenities to encourage a variety of students to attend. 
“We have been working closely to ensure that it will appeal to the students and incentivize to come by after the event, such as the complimentary snacks buffet, entry and a DJ spinning,” Free Play wrote. “[Free Play is] a unique fun location with arcade and classic games to add to the experience.” 
Because Post-Fest is the first event of its kind, Stiers said it was organized at the last minute.
“We had reached out to some other local venues and bars and we didn’t get anyone interested and then Free Play DTLA actually came along like two weeks ago maybe and offered their venue,” Stiers said. “So it’s been kind of a quick turn-around but they’ve been really accommodating.”

USC has been named one of the largest producers of  Fulbright scholars in the U.S. by the Fulbright U.S. Student Program. Fourteen students were accepted to the 2018-19 fellowship program, which has taken them to foreign countries to conduct research and teach English at international schools.
This is the seventh consecutive year USC has been named one of the top producers of Fulbright scholars in the nation. The cultural exchange program was established by J. William Fulbright and is sponsored by the Bureau of Educational and Cultural Affairs.
The program offers students who have completed their undergraduate degree an opportunity to spend one year in a foreign country, where they are provided with grants to complete community or research projects. 
According to USC, the University is projected to produce similar results in this year’s application cycle, as there are 30 semifinalists in the process, which is more than half of all USC students who applied. 
Alejandro Schugurensky, who graduated in 2018 with a degree in sociology, is using his Fulbright Scholarship to study the effects of socioeconomic statuses and policies on access to education in Brazil. Schugurensky said he decided to learn more about education because of the activities and research he had participated in at USC, including his role as a tutor for the John McKay Center.
“I took a class that was focused on international education systems, and I remember … one of the weeks of that class we discussed Brazil,” Schugurensky said. “I became passionate for studying Brazil’s educational inequality that are persistent in this country.” 
Prior to becoming a Fulbright scholar, Schugurensky conducted research in USC’s sociology department, studying educational opportunities in California with a focus on charter schools.
“My project looked at the differences in … access to higher education in Brazil over the past few years and where things are so unequal,” Schugurensky said. “Basically, what was the impact of the social policy in order to address higher education inequality in Brazil.”  
Rachel Udabe graduated in 2018 with degrees in political science and public policy and currently teaches English to elementary, middle and high school students in Taiwan. Udabe said she was influenced by her mother, who worked as a public school teacher and often expressed her views about the public education system.
As a child, Udabe was interested in Chinese and Taiwanese history and sought to combine it with her passion for education.
“Fulbright English Teaching was a way for me to be able to see inside Taiwanese schools, to see if I wanted to continue to pursue teaching or go more into the [education] policy route,” Udabe said. “It really covered all the bases of things I wanted to do and an after-college job.” 
Udabe said her experiences volunteering with the Joint Educational Project and the Civic Engagement Volunteer Program through the Unruh Institute of Politics, both of which send student volunteers into local classrooms, helped her discover her passion for teaching. 
“That co-teaching teaching experience, maybe not only [made me] know that I could do it, but I enjoyed doing it and I loved working with the kids,” Udabe said. 
Through her overseas experience, Udabe said she has improved her teaching skills. 
“I’ve just been able to really learn how to teach,” Udabe said. “Teaching is a profession where you always need to have a growth mindset, but I’ve definitely become more comfortable with being in the classroom. 
Peter Bergmann, who graduated in 2018 with a degree in economics and mathematics, is also using his Fulbright scholarship to teach English in Taiwan. Bergmann has studied Mandarin since freshman year, and said he wanted to learn more about East Asian culture.
“Education is a very interesting lens to view a country’s culture,” Bergmann said. “I feel like it was a very interesting way to learn about Taiwan in a way that’s different than just going to study abroad … I’m also really interested in the role that English plays in other countries.” 
According to Bergmann his work in the Brittingham Social Enterprise Lab, where he researched how business methods drive social change sparked his interest in education. 
“As I was trying to choose what I wanted to do after graduation, and they helped encourage me to choose more nontraditional career paths rather than just going straight into a job,” Bergmann said. 
After a year in Taiwan, Bergmann says he wants to continue living in East Asia and working. 
“I might stay in the teaching English as a foreign language role, or I might transfer to a more sustainable business or a sustainable energy-focused role,” Bergmann said.

Former USC kicker Matt Boermeester has filed a lawsuit against the University, alleging that his wrongful expulsion from the school in May 2017 ruined his athletic and academic careers. Boermeester was expelled after a school Title IX investigation concluded that he had physically abused his girlfriend, former USC tennis player Zoe Katz.
This is the second time Boermeester has tried to sue the University over this incident. In March 2018, he unsuccessfully filed a lawsuit to overturn his expulsion in superior court. This latest lawsuit includes seven causes of action, including negligence, intentional infliction of emotional distress and breach of contract. Boermeester is also accusing the University of selective Title IX enforcement, alleging its investigation  automatically assumed his guilt because he was a football player.
Andrew Miltenberg, Boermeester’s attorney, told USA Today that Boermeester “lost his education and his future career in the NFL” because school officials made “a complete mockery of the Title IX process.”
The University’s Title IX coordinator Gretchen Means, who led the investigation, and Vice President for Student Affairs Ainsley Carry are parties named in the lawsuit, along with USC.
The University launched its Title IX investigation after a student told his roommate he witnessed a physical altercation between Boermeester and Katz outside his window late one night. The roommate then told his father, men’s tennis coach Peter Smith, who reported what he heard to the University, as required by law.
The University’s investigation into the incident found that Boermeester put his hands around Katz’s neck, “causing her to cough, and shoved her into a cinder block wall in the alley near her apartment at least twice” on the morning of Jan. 21, 2017. 
Both Boermeester and Katz, who are still in a relationship, have denied that any physical altercation occurred. Both repeatedly claimed they were “horsing around” in a McDonald’s parking lot and throwing french fries at each other. Katz never filed a complaint with the University or LAPD, and Boermeester was never arrested or investigated by police regarding the allegations.
Miltenberg issued a statement Thursday alleging that the University did not practice proper due process in the investigation.
“Based on nothing more than a third-party report by a non-witness — essentially a rumor that was easily and repeatedly disputed — a star athlete lost his education and his future career in the NFL,” Miltenberg said.
The University re-affirmed its findings from the investigation in a statement issued Friday.
“USC stands by its investigation and the evidence in the Matthew Boermeester case,” the statement read. “In a similar lawsuit Boermeester filed in state court, a Los Angeles Superior Court judge in March 2018 ruled in USC’s favor, upholding his expulsion. The court found that substantial evidence, including video of the incident and statements from witnesses, supported our decision.Student disciplinary records are confidential. If the students involved waive their confidentiality rights, the university could provide more detailed information.”
In addition to Boermeester’s reinstatement at the school, Miltenberg told ESPN they are seeking financial compensation for damages and want the former kicker’s record expunged.

After realizing how harsh and uncomfortable fluorescent lighting in dorm rooms can be, Iovine and Young Academy freshmen Nina Cragg, Jesse Walk, Andy Wood and Hana Morrison decided there was need for change. 
They took advantage of Glo Up, a company  originally created as a yearlong project for their “Disruptive Innovation” class, which requires groups of students to come up with a product and sell 100 units of it. The four decided they wanted to focus on making dorm rooms more inviting and comfortable.
Wood was inspired to undertake the project because of his suitemate, who majors in lighting design, after watching him experiment with colored theater lighting gels in their room. 
“I told [my teammates] about [the lighting gels], and they thought that was a really cool opportunity to retrofit the really awful lighting fixtures in dorm rooms on campus in an easy, fast, affordable way,” Wood said.
Glo Up currently sells lighting gels for $15 each in BubbleGum Pink and Busta Blue, which he describes as fun party-style colors, and Chaotic Neutral, a simple yellow shade that neutralizes the harshness of the lighting. Each lighting gel is installed by attaching four magnets on the corner of the overhead lights and can be layered to create different lighting effects, Cragg said.
Cragg said the inspiration behind the company is that lighting in most dorm rooms is aggressive to the point that most students don’t want to use it. According to The New York Times, fluorescent lighting emits blue light, which can trigger migraines and disrupt circadian rhythms. 
“We hope that students can be more comfortable in their dorm rooms because it’s their home away from home,” Morrison said. “Especially for freshmen, it’s where you spend a lot of your time, and it’s where you want to be most comfortable.” 
The company is still awaiting official approval from USC Housing to proceed with installation in students’ rooms, but the team said its product is nonflammable and safe. 
“We are purchasing [our product] from a cinematic lighting gel recycler, and they buy these from different movies,” Cragg said. “Normal movie lighting gets super hot, and we figured that something meant for that would be [appropriate].” 
Professor Steve Barth, who teaches the class, invested $120 in Glo Up to help the team get started. The money allowed them to buy enough material for 25 products. Last Sunday, the team delivered eight pre-orders in person across the South, Birnkrant and New North residential colleges.
“[We’re helping] people install them, so we can get an understanding of how intuitive the process is for people and if we need to change things based off that,” Cragg said. 
Currently, the team is generating revenue through door-to-door sales and establishing its brand by word-of-mouth. However, it also has an online presence on Instagram and its own website.
The company hopes to further expand by adding more colors and developing discounted packs and new shapes and selling to office spaces.
“We want to expand our business to have a wider range of colors, to have more inventory at a time and sell at the beginning of next semester to incoming freshmen and to expand to other dorms,” Cragg said.
