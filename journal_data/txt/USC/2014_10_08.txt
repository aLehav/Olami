Carcinogenic toxins in the air have been reduced by more than 50 percent in the last nine years in the Southern California region, according to the South Coast Air Quality Management District.
The South Coast Air Quality Management District’s Multiple Air Toxics Study IV showed that the cancer risk caused by air pollution in Southern California decreased from 1,194 in 1 million in 2005 to 418 in 1 million in 2012-2013.
MATES IV discovered that despite the decrease in cancer risk, remaining toxic emissions can still be harmful. The majority of these remaining emissions was caused by diesel from trucks, vehicles and other equipment.
“Air pollution is very much still a threat, especially in specific areas in Los Angeles or California, particularly near roadways and other emission sources,” said David Ginsburg, assistant professor of environmental studies at USC.
Ninety percent of the cancer risk was caused by various other modes of transportation, including cars.
“I know that 418 in a million doesn’t seem that high, but I think that number can still be lowered, especially considering the technology that we have now,” said Allison Apfel, a sophomore majoring in health promotion and disease prevention.
The greatest cancer risk in the region was found to be 1,050 in 1 million around the Los Angeles’s ports. Higher cancer risks were also discovered around freeways and other centers of transportation. Southwest Riverside County, the Coachella Valley and south and central Orange County, however, showed some of the smallest risks.
“Being a California resident, you can see the smog over the city, and it’s a huge concern for me and other Californians,” Apfel said.
In order to determine the cancer risk in various parts of Southern California, MATES IV measured the amounts of 37 different toxins in the air at monitoring stations located throughout some Southern California counties.
“There have been better policies to enforce stricter air emission regulations so I think that has had a major impact on reducing smog,” Ginsburg said.
Even though the cancer risk has gone down over the past nine years, a recent study conducted by the California Office of Environmental Health Hazard Assessment has discovered that the true extent of cancer risk due to pollution and other toxic factors has been underestimated based on the state’s current standards.
This underestimation, however, does not change the fact that the amounts of carcinogenic toxins in the air have gone down by over 50 percent since 2005.
“I think [a further decrease in smog] is yet to be seen,” Ginsburg said. “We have done a very good job at reducing emissions and it could continue to go down but I think we are probably at the lowest point without having a lot of pushback against any new regulations that were to come out.”
South Coast Air Quality Management District works on controlling air pollution in certain parts of Los Angeles, Orange, San Bernadino and Riverside Counties.
“We only get one planet and need to be aware of what we are doing to it,” said Tsen-Yin Lin, a sophomore majoring in communication and political science.

The USC Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism hosted a meet and greet dinner Wednesday night for journalism students to get acquainted with this year’s Annenberg Innovator in Residence, Alexis Lloyd.
Lloyd is the Creative Director of The New York Times Research and Development Lab. She investigates various types of technologies and multimedia approaches that aim to advance the field of journalism within the next five years.
“Technology and innovation around technology [have] pretty radically transformed a lot about journalism and news, but the vast majority of that information has happened around the readers’ experience of the news — how to make news on different platforms, such as Twitter and news apps,” Lloyd said.
Her main focus of this week is on improving the efficiency of reporting itself. During her tenure at The New York Times, she has studied technologies and databases that are trying to improve the speed of article production and ensure that data is synthesized for a multitude of media outlets.
“There hasn’t been as much attention paid to the reporting process, to everything that happens before everyone sees that material,” Lloyd said. “There are a lot of challenges that we can really innovate around.”
The event was presented by the USC Annenberg Innovation Lab as part of a weeklong agenda featuring Lloyd’s expertise on technology in the media. Students in attendance at the event were mainly master’s students and Ph.D. candidates in journalism or communication.
“I think it’s really incredible to have someone like Alexis Lloyd come in here to tie in technological advancements to journalism,” said Alex Gold, a second year master’s student in strategic public relations. “She’s really leading the charge in journalism’s future, and I think that’s really important here in a school like Annenberg: to have her share her knowledge and wealth of experience with us and help guide us,”
During the meet and greet, students had the opportunity to collaborate in groups to discuss possible reporting innovations and pitch their ideas to Lloyd at the conclusion of the event.
“It’s been really nice to have Alexis [Lloyd] here to expedite our process as journalists and having these circles to come together and brainstorm ideas,” said Stephanie Monte, a second year master’s student in journalism.
The Annenberg Innovator in Residence Program began in 2009 as the result of a generous gift by USC alumni and Annenberg parents Dr. Mitchell and Deena Lew. Since its conception, the program has hosted various innovators such as author and computer scientist Jaron Lanier, who in 2010 was named one of Time magazine’s 100 Most Influential People, and Aaron Koblin, the leader of the Data Arts Team in Google’s Creative Lab.
“This week has been great. It’s really nice to switch contexts and get different perspectives from people who are coming out of the programs here,” Lloyd said.
Gabriel Kahn, a professor of professional practice at Annenberg and Director of the Future of Journalism at the Annenberg Innovation Lab, said that Lloyd quickly rose to the top among the candidates for this year’s program.
“Particularly with journalism, one of the big struggles is to think in a time frame that’s more than just six months to a year out,” Kahn said. “It was really refreshing to see her thinking about stuff for, well she says three to five years out, but to me it sounds more like ten years out. She’s really projecting a different future for journalism in a business that’s so constrained by tradition.”
The schedule of events over the past several days included an interactive panel entitled  the Future of Journalism, a class visit called Social and Economic Implications of Communication Tech and a public talk named Human in the Loop: Conversations Between People and Machines.
“This week has been really rewarding so far,” said Sophie Madej, program coordinator of USC Annenberg Innovation Lab. “It’s nice to have Lloyd in the classroom so students can get that one-on-one time, which has more of a lasting impact than just lots of lectures.”

The Jesse M. Unruh Institute of Politics, in partnership with the USC College Democrats, USC College Republicans and the Daily Trojan, held its biweekly Students Talk Back forum on Wednesday. With the onset of midterm elections, the panel discussed potential changes in immigration policy.
Midterm season · Commentators discussed the role immigration will play in the midterm elections this fall and the general elections in 2016. – Mariya Dondonyan | Daily Trojan
This week’s forum entitled, “Refugee Crisis at the Border: Immigration Reform’s New Challenge,” discussed the popular areas of concern regarding foreseeable changes in immigration policy.
The talk featured panelists Dan Schnur, executive director of the Unruh Institute; Mike Madrid, Principal at Grassroots Lab; Christina Wilkes, communications director of the College Democrats; and Alexander Kludjian, executive board member of the College Republicans. The panel also featured co-moderators Kerstyn Olson, deputy director of the Unruh Institute and Isabella Sayyah, managing editor of the Daily Trojan.
Recently, President Barack Obama announced his plans to halt any administrative action on immigration reform until midterm elections are over. A significant increase in the number of unattended children and minors left at the border has angered those who feel the government should take action.
Olson opened the panel by discussing the way in which the presidential candidates for the 2016 election will handle the issue of immigration reform.
Madrid set the stage for the discussion by pointing out some key differences in voter apathy regarding immigration between voters in California and those in the Midwest and the South.
“Where it gets particularly complicated for the President is with some of the battleground states, states in the Midwest and South where more conservative Democrats [are trying] to hold their senate seats, and the President has decided to hold off action until the end of election,” Madrid said.
Madrid also pointed out that Latinos in the past had the tendency to vote in a block. He said that this has changed, as generational differences reveal changes of opinion among Latino voters of different ages.
“The calculation is a complicated one because it affects both Latino voters, which is of course paramount to the Democratic party base, but also white, Midwest and Southern voters, where the issue of immigration is seen completely differently,” Madrid said.
Wilkes commented on the issue by stating that a political candidate’s relevancy depends on his or her ability to respond to the United States’ shifting demographics.
She pointed out that it was important for Republicans to undergo a shift in thinking with regard to the Latino population in the United States.
“It’s not looking like the cooperation between the House and the Senate is really going to allow for that comprehensive bill to get done by 2016,” Wilkes said. “So, I think it’s going to play a very important role, and in this past election Obama won 71 percent of the Latino vote. I think Republicans are finally realizing that they have to beacon a message that is more sympathetic towards Latino voters.”
Schnur pointed out that that Obama has faced criticism in response to his lack of action on immigration reform. Last June, Obama stated he would utilize executive action in responding to immigration issues if Congress did not take significant steps to complete comprehensive immigration reform. However, such executive action did not materialize.
“Over the course of the summer, as we saw this tremendous influx of young people coming from Central America, national public opinion turned in the exact opposite direction and made Americans much less receptive to the kinds of comprehensive reform that President Obama and Bush had been fighting for,” Schnur said.
Kludjian said that potential changes in immigration reform could be an opportunity for the Republican Party to gain an advantage in the midterm elections.
“I think the GOP has a golden opportunity because we do have a president that has largely ostracized the Latino community, who has promised them things and has not delivered, and I think the changing demographics is something that is concrete and something we can work off of,” he said.

On Wednesday, five members of USC’s Sigma Nu fraternity were arrested for stealing plants and garden decorations from front lawns in the city of Alhambra.  According to the San Gabriel Valley Tribune, the students told police that the statues would be used as decorations for a future fraternity party.
A witness saw four men in a black 2004 Ford F-150 driving through neighborhoods, running into yards and back to their vehicle. The incident took place in the 300 block of South Almansor Street at 1:17 a.m.
Five minutes later, an officer spotted the vehicle with a truck bed full of palm leaves and plants heading north. The men were then pulled over.
Johnson  also told the Tribune that the suspects were using pruning shears to cut of tops of small palm trees and that they also stole three duck statues, a cat statue and a Buddha statue. Police believe the students stole from more than one front lawn.
The five suspects’ Facebook pages mentioned a Sigma Nu party for Oct. 11. Police are not sure that the stolen plants and statues are for that party, but the pictures on Facebook for the event included photos of birds and palm trees.
The event was canceled on Wednesday after news of the arrests broke.
The five students were arrested on suspicion of grand theft and conspiracy to commit grand theft. They were released on $20,000 bail each.
 
Expel them and take away Sigma Nu’s House. This douchey, entitled culture needs to end.
LOL…how cheesy and embarrassing.

The ongoing issue of sexual assault policy at USC was the topic of discussion for a panel discussion that took place Wednesday evening.
Opening a dialogue · Jenny Di, president and founder of the Roosevelt Institute at USC, moderated the panel discussion with student and administrative leaders on campus. – Jessica Zhou | Daily Trojan
 
Panelists included Jody Shipper, USC’s Title IX Coordinator; Ekta Kumar, director of the Center for Women and Men; Shyann Murphy, co-executive director of the Women’s Student Assembly; Rini Sampath, Undergraduate Student Government vice president; Francesca Bessey, USG assistant director of Wellness Affairs; and Karina Eileraas, visiting professor of gender studies.
The Roosevelt Institute, a newly established organization on campus, organized the discussion. The Roosevelt Institute’s main goal is to promote conversations among students and administration. They contacted student and administrative leaders involved in sexual assault policy and invited them to attend as panelists.
“They approached us recently after we launched the Trojans Respect Consent page just two weeks ago,” Sampath said. “Since then that page has already gained 1,100 likes on Facebook and I think we really caught the attention of students on campus who are also working hard to combat sexual violence.”
Panelist Francesca Bessey was one of the students who created the Student Coalition Against Rape group at USC in Spring 2013. She hoped the panel would be an open conversation about sexual assault.
“Often when I say the word rape in a room, I see people flinch,” Bessey said. “That’s a really big problem because I’ve never heard of something we’ve been able to solve without being able to talk about it openly.”
Jenny Di, president and founder of the Roosevelt Institute, moderated the discussion. After introductions of each member’s experience and background with sexual assault policy, the panel was asked what actions are being taken by each of their departments or groups to address the issue.
“There has been ongoing training behind the scenes for administrators, DPS, those who handle sexual assault and those who might be the first to receive information about sexual assault,” Shipper said.
Efforts to raise awareness about sexual assault policy among the student body was also a point of discussion.
“We’re trying to promote the fact that this is not about talking to the same students who already know how to help others,” Sampath said. “We want every student at USC thinking about how to help others through bystander intervention and how we can change the culture on campus.”
The new California Affirmative Consent or “yes means yes” law and misconceptions surrounding it were also discussed.
“I think one of the most vocalized critiques of this legislation has been that people assume this will now create an atmosphere of panic where there has to be a vocalized consent,” Eileraas said. “So there is a fear that this will lead to a flurry of false rape accusations.”
Lena Melillo, director of the Take Back the Week Event for the Women’s Student Assembly, attended the event.
“I’m interested in Women’s Student Assembly teaming up with other organizations on campus because of the problems they brought up of it being a very fragmented activism,” she said. “There’s so many different organizations working on the same thing that it would be a lot stronger if all of them came together.”

As an actor, Glover has also been hard at work writing and starring in Atlanta, a show that was picked up by FX. He also has been mentoring both Jaden Smith and Chance the Rapper in their rap careers, leaving many to wonder how anyone has time for it all.
Known for balancing his acting career and his hip-hop persona, Glover has not slowed down since his early days of writing for 30 Rock under the supervision of Tina Fey. He also starred in the TV show Community during this time and put out his first album, Camp. Then, while continuing to act on Community, Glover released Because the Internet along with a side script and short films to accompany the tracks. He also went on tour and began writing a book. Out of all of these projects came two separate music projects, a mixtape (STN MTN), and an EP (“Kauai”).
STN MTN, the Atlanta-oriented mixtape produced by the legendary DJ Drama features Gambino rapping on both his own tracks as well as classics by Lil Wayne and others. It is a vintage  mixtape, with simple production and complex lyrics, showing off his rapping ability as a good mixtape should. It revolves around Gambino’s experiences growing up near Atlanta and opens with a monologue about a dream Gambino had about ruling the city.
Gambino raps “I had a dream I ran Atlanta, and I was on every radio station … Chick-Fil-A will be open on Sundays … Strippers will get Mother’s Day off” and other outlandish statements of a Gambino-run utopia (or dystopia) as he transitions into a rework of fellow Georgia native Ludacris’s “Southern Hospitality.” Though much of the subject matter on STN MTN is politically charged — featuring lyrics about racism in Atlanta — it does not distract from Gambino’s lyrical ability. If anything, this mixtape is Childish Gambino proving that he can rap about almost anything, which is in contrast to the clean production of the album he released in conjunction with STN MTN.
“Kauai” is an EP that features new tracks as well as some old, reworked songs and slam poetry by friend and fellow actor-rapper Jaden Smith. In an interview with Complex, Gambino explained that “Kauai” is the reality that Gambino wakes up to after the dreams of his hometown that make up the STN MTN mixtape released on the same day. With a mix of both 808s and tropical drums, “Kauai” attempts to place the listener in its namesake island in Hawaii, and with Jaden Smith acting as a young Childish Gambino, recounting his memories of beach days in slam prose, this is an impressive, experimental album.
In exchange for borrowing the island vibes of “Kauai,” proceeds from album sales will go to both cleaning up the island and funding the placement of cameras on police uniforms around the country, a cause Gambino has been fighting to combat racism in his hometown of Stone Mountain, Georgia.  The EP doesn’t discuss how Gambino shared his hometown with the second revival of the KKK, but his mixtape discusses it at length. “Kauai” instead focuses on the present and is much lighter, talking about love and the beach for most of the songs.
The Georgia native reworked two songs from his previous albums, including “Love is Crazy” which was reworked into a song called “Retro” and “V. 3005” which Gambino re-released as “V. 3005-Beach Picnic Version.” Though these songs are Gambino’s older work, the new edits show how far his technical and lyrical abilities have come since just last year’s Because the Internet, let alone his Sick Boi mixtape from 2008, Gambino has always been one of the best lyricists in hip-hop, but the verses on this album put him even farther ahead of his competition. One line in the second song, “Pop Thieves (Make It Feel Good)” illustrates this point and shows the fun Gambino has with his music.
“Now that we have found this love, baby/ these haters can’t say sh-t/ I know sometimes its hard when I’m so far/ I know you miss this di-love” opens the second verse, and the subtle track skipping at the end of these lines furthers the joke that he wasn’t really going to say love.
There are small technical tricks dispersed throughout this album that make it feel much more intimate, as if the listener is sitting in on the last recording session before the album’s release.
With Gambino’s blend of soul and hip-hop and his experimentation with island music, “Kauai” has no real comparison, and it isn’t his only project at the moment, making it all the more impressive. Between acting, writing and rapping, it seems there’s nothing Glover can’t do, and STN MTN/”Kauai” only serves to emphasize that.

One of the few things more thrilling than a movie documenting journalistic exposure and government conspiracy is knowing that the film in question is based on a true story. Michael Cuesta’s Kill the Messenger delivers all that and more in a gripping tale of secrecy and lies — all supported by the all-star performance of Jeremy Renner. The film is every bit as exciting as it is sobering, and has the potential to become an instant classic as a tribute to the unsung heroes behind the headlines.
Under pressure · Jeremy Renner puts in an oscar-worthy performance as Gary Webb, a journalist who uncovered a major government conspiracy. – Photo courtesy of Focus Features
Renner plays American journalist Gary Webb, who in 1996 is working as a reporter for the San Jose Mercury News. He is contacted by Coral Baca (Paz Vega), the girlfriend of a cocaine distributor in legal trouble who provides Webb evidence that the Central Intelligence Agency is linked to the selling of cocaine in America. Her box of evidence leads Webb to cocaine tycoon “Freeway” Ricky Ross (Michael Kenneth Williams) and his defense attorney Alan Fenster (Tim Blake Nelson).
They back up Baca’s theory — and Webb finds himself in Nicaragua and Washington D.C., writing the story of his life to expose the government. In both the movie and in real life, Webb alleged that the CIA during the 1980s deliberately funneled profits from the cocaine trade to support the Contras; a group in Nicaragua who the CIA hoped would overthrow Nicaragua’s communist government. Webb further alleged that the CIA shielded arrested traffickers from prosecution, and it was these actions that led to the cocaine epidemic that has swept the United States, particularly South Central Los Angeles, since the 1980s.
But the story of Webb’s life ultimately becomes what threatens it — and when his series of articles, dubbed “Dark Alliance,” run online and in print, higher powers both in the government and other news outlets that missed the story take aim at Webb’s credibility as a journalist. Webb finds himself struggling to choose between mending his disintegrating family and proving the truth behind his story. Though the CIA eventually admitted the connection in a 400 plus page report two years later, Webb’s life and career is forever changed.
Kill the Messenger puts the conflicts faced by modern day muckrakers in very real terms, and as Webb’s life disintegrates, it subtly urges viewers to wonder if “some stories are just too true to tell.” In the mind of journalists, there is a moment of indecision before every story where the writer reconciles the need to tell the truth with the blowback of telling it. Renner and the cast behind him beautifully document that struggle.
What will ultimately set Kill the Messenger apart from the rest of the politically charged thrillers in recent years (looking at you, The Fifth Estate) is that the saga of Gary Webb is a true story that most people aren’t aware of, which makes it a welcome addition to a populace who are both tired and already aware of the stories behind folks like Edward Snowden and Julian Assange. As the film notes, most of the fallout from Webb’s exposé and subsequent character assassination, which took place at the end of the ’90s, was swallowed by the much more significant and headline-sexy Monica Lewinsky scandal.
But, as the stories of Snowden and Assange continue to write themselves, the film’s beautiful recollection is all too relevant to today’s debate — and its controversial nature primes it for box-office success.
 
Kill the Messenger also balances a political story with an exploration of the tragic hero as Webb’s professional life begins dragging skeletons from his personal life closet, leaving a growing rift between Webb and children and wife Sue (Rosemarie DeWitt). DeWitt, who met with the real-life Sue Webb prior to filming, brings a depth and understanding to Sue Webb that is quite well done — and her performance is surely worthy of consideration for a supporting actress Oscar. Through it all, Renner is able to humanize Webb’s external and internal struggles in a way reminiscent of Daniel Day-Lewis’s portrayal of Abraham Lincoln or Russell Crowe’s portrayal of John Nash in A Beautiful Mind, and he deserves both praise and Oscar consideration as a result.
In the 1960 film Inherit the Wind, Gene Kelly’s character E.K. Hornbeck preaches, “it is the duty of a newspaper to comfort the afflicted and afflict the comfortable.”
Kill the Messenger will refresh and inspire viewers of the timeless nature of that insight, and remind them that newspapers, too, are not free of scrutiny. In that regard, it will leave audiences with more questions than answers, and certainly with more mistrust of the powers that be. Because of that, the movie carries the legacy of Gary Webb’s career and passion for truth forward — all while paying a fitting tribute to the men and women behind the stories.

After fourteen years of dancing with the Australian Ballet, principal dancer Leanne Stojmenov still considers the professional stage an escape from the rigors of everyday life.
“It creates a feeling inside you,” Stojmenov said. “It can take you away on a story.”
Stojmenov will play the main role of Odette in the Australian Ballet’s production of Swan Lake, which plays at the Music Center in downtown Los Angeles for five performances this weekend from October 9-12.
This is the Australian Company’s first visit to Los Angeles in over 40 years according to artistic director David McAllister , and a momentous return to the prestigious Dorothy Chandler Pavilion stage.
Choreographer Graeme Murphy’s original take on the traditional story of Swan Lake  will stun viewers, as it blends the traditional Tchaikovsky score with newer elements of drama in a large scale production. The New York Times connected the production to elements of tragedy in the story of Diana, Princess of Wales, in the despair of the heroine.
For those unfamiliar with the story of Swan Lake, the ballet tells the tale of romance between young Odette and Prince Siegfried, a romance that is thwarted by the evil magician Rothbart. Murphy’s version takes the traditional tale of Odette’s transformation into a swan at the hands of Rothbart and twists it to conjure Odette’s psychological breakdown.
The story as a whole is well known as tragically beautiful, playing into the #whatisbeauty campaign of the Australian Ballet company for their upcoming season. Their different productions represent varying manifestations of beauty, and the company has asked its patrons to define the word themselves through social media. The response has been enthusiastic from both sides, as audiences get more involved in their beloved ballet troupe.
To dancer Stojmenov, beauty in the tragedy of Swan Lake is unparalleled, and a tender concept to capture onstage.
“To me, beauty is showing vulnerability, and it’s what this production shows,” Stojmenov said. “You definitely have to show vulnerability to showcase reality and human characters in this ballet.”
Swan Lake,  in particular, is rooted in its emotional impact, and Stojmenov described learning the role as twofold. After getting the steps down, dancers must take time to sync with their partners, as well as imbue the parts with appropriate feeling.
The result is a strong connection between the audience and the dancers as they experience the highs and lows of the story Stojmenov insists. Classical ballet is not just an experience in seeing people dance around.
“Ballet is such a unique art form. It can culturally expand you to see art in physicality,” Stojmenov said.
Response to the Australian Ballet has been enthusiastic: They are the busiest large touring company in the world, with over 200 performances annually, both locally and internationally. Their production of Swan Lake has toured London, Tokyo, Paris, New York and Shanghai before arriving in Los Angeles this weekend.
Among classical art forms, ballet has been one of the most successful at retaining its popularity, with a cultural interest in beauty, as well as companies’ efforts to connect traditional works with modern audiences. Swan Lake has been in the company’s repertoire since 2002.
“It’s so much part of the company’s DNA now,” McAllister told the Los Angeles Times. He described how many of the principal dancers had played ensemble parts in their pasts, and before working their way up through the production. Stojmenov is one such dancer, having played a signet ensemble role before playing the part of Odette.
She mentioned the emphasis placed on maintaining a balance between old and new in the world of ballet. Though tradition remains exalted, contemporary choreographers are exploring new artistic frontiers, pushing the boundaries of both original and classic works. Graeme Murphy’s choreography is widely applauded for walking this fine line with well-received results.
Stojmenov has been a principal dancer since 2011 and danced with the West Australian Ballet before her time at the Australian Ballet. She describes the dance community as her home, and the troupe as a tight-knit group.
“We’ve been known for going in headfirst,” she said, commenting on the company’s reputation for having athletic prowess. “And you feel that really strong energy on stage. It’s not just the principals; it’s everyone.”
 
This production of Swan Lake comes to Los Angeles as a part of the twelfth season of Glorya Kaufman Presents Dance at the Music Center, a leading curator of performing arts in Los Angeles. The program is in its second decade and is well-known for supporting new works as well as continuing to bring some of the world’s most influential dancers and choreographers to the area.
 
The performance was beautiful.  The vulnerability of the characters was heartbreaking.  The contemporary choreography brings a new element to the performance.  The Corps de Ballet however need to sync up.  I found their off timing to be distracting.  The men were beautiful to watch as were Odette and Prince Siegfried. Bravo!

After splitting a road swing with Washington and Washington State, the USC women’s volleyball team returns home for a four-match homestand starting Friday night against the Colorado Buffaloes.
Deep dish · Sophomore setter Alice Pizzasegola has been a large contributor this season, ranking second on the team with 266 sets. – Samuel Chang | Daily Trojan
During the road trip, then-No. 19 USC (8-6, 1-3 Pac-12) fell to then-No. 4 Washington in straight sets, but rebounded with a hard-fought five-set win over the Cougars.
The Women of Troy now set their sights on their next opponents during a crucial weekend, as they hope to improve their status in the Pac-12 as well as their national ranking.
Unfortunately for USC, the Galen Center has not been the safe haven it once was this season. The Women of Troy hold a 108-16 all-time home record; so far in 2014 the Women of Troy are 0-4 at home.
During this week’s practice, the team picked up its focus and intensity. Sophomore setter Alice Pizzasegola spoke highly of her team’s preparation over the past few days.
“We had a drill where one hitter was against the other hitter,” Pizzasegola said. “It was really helpful because we need to compete every time, every point and every game.”
Head coach Mick Haley had similar sentiments about this week’s practice.
“They were very competitive, and they were pretty focused,” Haley said.
Colorado (10-6, 2-2) visits the Southland after a strong performance against then-No. 14 Arizona, in which they swept the Wildcats in three games. Going into Friday’s match, the Women of Troy have never lost against the Buffaloes in eight chances all-time.
The Buffaloes have two excellent setters, Gabby Simpson and Nicole Edelman, who feed standout outside hitter Taylor Simpson. Simpson leads the team in kills with 285, 187 more than the next player.
Colorado also has formidable blockers up front. The squad averages 2.2 blocks per set and is led by middle blocker Anna Pfefferle.
On Saturday, the Women of Troy will continue their home slate against Utah (11-4, 1-3). Though the Utes have not played many highly ranked opponents this season, the team did beat a dangerous Arizona State squad that can already claim wins over USC and Colorado.
Just like Colorado, the Utes run a traditional offense with six hitters and two setters. Outside hitter Chelsey Schofield-Olsen leads the team in kills with 184, an average of 3.47 kills per set. The Utes’ top setters are Kalee Kirby and Kendall Cygen. Kirby leads the team with 284 assists, while Cygen is close behind with 215.
As the Women of Troy continue to improve, they have been relying heavily on junior outside hitter Samantha Bricio. A standout two-way player, Bricio leads the team in kills with 191 and is second in digs with 142. Sophomore libero Taylor Whittingham has also been a crucial piece of USC’s success, passing out of the back row during key serve-receive situations.
Whittingham, the leader in the back row, knows that defending serves can be tough.
“It’s difficult because it’s never the same thing twice,” Whittingham said. “You work on your technique, but you have to adjust to the serve and the server.”
Passing will be very important if the Women of Troy want to knock off both teams this weekend. If USC can win both matches this weekend, they will be right back in the middle of the conference, where they can still make a run at a Pac-12 title.
The team’s starting setter, senior Hayley Crone, has gained praise from Haley for her improvement since the beginning of the season.
“[Crone] is getting her confidence back and that is the biggest thing,” Haley said. “She was releasing the ball nice in practice and the better she gets, the better we’ll be.”
Friday’s game against the Buffaloes tips off at 6 p.m. PST at the Galen Center. The Women of Troy face the Utes just a day later at 7 p.m.
After about a week off, USC will face another challenge: hosting the No. 11 Oregon Ducks on Oct. 17.

I’m not exactly the first to say this, but whatever makes college football make sense stopped working last week.
In a three-day span starting on Thursday, 11 ranked teams lost, including four of the top six squads in the nation. After upset wins from Mississippi State and Ole Miss, a state with three FBS programs has as many teams ranked in the top-four of the AP Poll (two) as the state of California has in the entire top-25.
Pandemonium · The Pac-12 conference has seen its share of wild endings so far this season. Arizona defeated Cal on a last-second Hail Mary last month, while USC suffered the same fate against Arizona State on Saturday. – Tony Zhou | Daily Trojan
 
Heisman front-runners such as Oregon’s Marcus Mariota and Texas A&M’s Kenny Hill looked entirely ordinary, while Notre Dame quarterback Everett Golson — who missed all of last season while under academic suspension — completed a miraculous, Matt Leinart-esque 4th-and-11 pass to beat Stanford.
Nowhere was this week of weirdness more apparent than in the Pac-12 conference. For the second time in as many seasons, Mariota and the Ducks fell victim to the unstoppable force that is Arizona linebacker Scooby Wright, losing 31-24 at home. Oregon dropped from No. 2 to No. 12 in the AP Poll, while the Wildcats rose to No. 10, becoming the conference’s highest-ranked team for the first time since 1999.
Washington State quarterback Connor Halliday set an NCAA record with 734 passing yards in a game against Cal that featured 119 combined points, only to eventually watch his team lose on a missed 19-yard field goal. Utah used a backup quarterback, a miraculous catch and four field goals to upset then-No. 8 UCLA. What was left of Stanford’s playoff hopes were dashed on the aforementioned Golson throw. And then there was a Hail Mary. We all saw it. I don’t want to talk about it.
When the dust settled, Arizona was left as the conference’s only top-10 team. ASU and Utah jumped into the top-25 at No. 20 and No. 24, respectively, while the Bruins fell to the 18th slot. Rounding out the group is Stanford at No. 25. And if you think the AP poll is out of whack, take a look at the Pac-12 standings. The plucky Wildcats are the kings of the south with an undefeated record. In the north, the Golden Bears’ improbable win over Halliday and the Cougars gave Sonny Dykes’ squad — owners of a 0-9 conference record just a year ago — sole possession of first place at 2-1.
But wait, it gets weirder! If not for Arizona’s Hail Mary win — I’m really starting to dislike that phrase — over Cal a few weeks ago, the Bears would be the conference’s only unbeaten team, a full two wins clear of any competition in the Pac-12 North.
Alright. Take a breather. You probably need one, especially if you’re a fan of USC, UCLA, Oregon, Cal, ASU, Washington State, Utah, Arizona or, come to think of it, pretty much any college football team in the nation this year. Things will get easier, or at least more predictable.
As muddled as the last month or so of Pac-12 play has made just about everything, this week’s slate should put the 2014 season back on track. I think.
Four Pac-12 teams are out of action this weekend, leaving four intriguing conference matchups. The main event features Oregon visiting the Rose Bowl to take on UCLA, a contest between two teams that came into the year with high expectations both looking to avoid consecutive losses. Given the Ducks’ still-dynamic offense and the Bruins’ weakness in all non-Brett Hundley areas, Oregon should take this one pretty handily.
Stanford hosts Washington State on Friday in a game that I’m sure will sound the upset horn among prognosticators, especially considering the Cardinal’s sudden inability to score points, something the Cougars’ are pretty good at. Still, I’m not sold. Even given what head coach Mike Leach has done to improve Wazzu as an all-around football team, the Cardinal dominated last year’s matchup, winning 55-17 on the road. It’s not like either of these teams have changed strategies in the past 12 months. I think the better team gets the job done here as well.
Cal and Washington, two teams that boast 4-1 overall records yet are on opposite ends of the Pac-12 North standings, will square off in Berkeley on Saturday. The Bears can clearly put up points and have a legitimate special teams star in Trevor Davis, but their defense is an absolute mystery. Fortunately for Cal fans, the squad is facing a Washington squad that has been anything but impressive in its first five games under new head coach Chris Petersen. I’ll give the Bears the edge on this one.
Finally, there’s Saturday’s nightcap: a duel in the desert between the surging Arizona Wildcats and the reeling USC Trojans.
Whether it’s my Trojan fandom or my belief in regression to the mean, I have a good feeling about this game. USC is not as bad as it showed during parts of last week’s loss, and the Wildcats are not the world-beaters they appear to be after five games — remember, Arizona snuck past UTSA by three points and struggled to score on a now-nonexistent Cal defense for three quarters. Trojans get the win.
If my predictions indeed come true, the wild, wacky and wonderfully weird Pac-12 will get a lot more normal. Cal would still have the edge up north, but with an upcoming bye week and matchups with Stanford and playoff-hopeful Oregon to come, that edge is pretty slim. In the south, the Trojans would actually take the lead — for now. If USC wins out, not a guarantee by any stretch of the imagination, it still loses a head-to-head tiebreaker with ASU.
So that’s that. A weird year in the Pac-12 could very well calm down this week. Or UCLA could beat Oregon on a last-second fake field-goal Hail Mary from Hundley to Jerry Neuheisel. Who knows?

The Trojans are moving on from their latest defeat and have shifted their focus toward Saturday’s matchup with the undefeated Arizona Wildcats. A win against the Pac-12 foe would earn the team sole possession of first place in the south division.
Seymour wins · Junior defensive back Kevon Seymour and the Trojan defense are aiming to put a last-second lapse against ASU behind them. Seymour has 18 total tackles this season, second on the team at his position. – Benjamin Dunn | Daily Trojan
24-Hour Rule
“After those 24 hours, get over it and move on,” sophomore linebacker Su’a Cravens said. “I was over it before the night was over. It is what it is and on to the next team.”
Cravens’ mindset was shared among all of the players who are now focused on improving their game in preparation for a formidable opponent. Though Arizona has the capability to explode on offense, the Trojans are approaching the week as they would every week: just another game.
“We’re going to remember [the loss] but we’re using it as motivation,” junior cornerback Kevon Seymour said. “You live and you learn.”
With a play as devastating as the Hail Mary that beat the Trojans on Saturday, it is easy to see how that could affect their preparation going forward, but most players are using it as motivation.
“You have to grow from it and make sure it doesn’t happen again,” senior linebacker Hayes Pullard said. “It’s something to learn from.”
Defending Wilcox
There has been a lot of scrutiny from pundits and Trojan fans aimed toward defensive coordinator Justin Wilcox. Though his play-calling ability and game management have been targeted, his players have been quick to defend their coach, saying that it is their responsibility to make an impact on the field.
“As players, we just have to go up and make that play,” Seymour said. “It’s not [Wilcox]’s fault. The defense is out there on the field, we have to make it right, it’s not the coaches’ fault.”
Pullard is another player who has seen a lot of attention due to his involvement in the last play of the game against Arizona State. He has recognized his mistake and will use it to learn and to get better for the rest of the season.
“I just saw the ball in the air, I made a mistake on not just jumping and going after it and getting it like what I’m supposed to be doing,” Pullard said. “Everyone has that play, you just don’t think it out.”
Pullard seemed poised and confident when talking about his miscue, and he is focused on continuing to lead the team and bounce back.
Finding an identity 
Due to a few big scoring plays last week, questions have been asked about the team’s defensive identity and many have wondered if defensive lapses will be a common occurrence for the rest of the year. Head coach Steve Sarkisian quickly praised his defensive players, both in their effort and their ability.
“It’s unfortunate that the game ended the way it did the other night because we played really good defense against a really good offense for three and a half quarters,” Sarkisian said. “For whatever reason, we give up a 98-yard drive, we give up a 73-yard touchdown pass and then we give up a Hail Mary in three series in a row and that’s where the focus is. But I think we’re doing good things. I think we’re improving and I think we’ll continue to improve.”
Sarkisian also provided praise for his defensive coordinator, whom he continues to stand behind amid all of the scrutiny.
“I think he’s doing a really good job,” Sarkisian said. “Justin [Wilcox] is a very good coach and we’re lucky to have him.”
Sarkisian made sure to mention that he appreciated the effort of his entire team, not just his defense, following a tough loss.
“I loved what these guys brought today,” Sarkisian said. “They’re going to be challenged [against Arizona]. But we’re plenty capable.”
 
 
 
 
 
So. Will Sark apologize every other game now for poor performance?
How about the head coach taking the responsibility for the loss and not transfer blame to the players. Coach O wouldn’t have done that.

In his talk to Harvard University students at the John F. Kennedy School of Government on Oct. 2, Vice President Joe Biden aimed to succinctly put current world affairs into context. Speaking about topics ranging broadly from the Ebola pandemic to the recent uprisings in Hong Kong, the vice president’s remarks turned sour when he implied that the rise of ISIS was due in large part to the actions of U.S. allies in the region. For the past week, Biden has been on an apology tour, calling Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, Crown Prince of Abu Dhabi Mohammed bin Zayed and a Saudi official to apologize for his comments.
As that long list of names suggests, Biden’s unfiltered remarks to Harvard students have been widely thought of as a major political mistake. Yet, in taking on this view, many have sorely overlooked the laudable aspects of the talk — elements that are arguably more worthy of discussion than political offenses. Though people have rushed to label Biden’s remarks as a gaffe, I say that he should be applauded for engaging in honest discussion with students. It’s refreshing to see a politician — a high-ranking one at that — abandon talking points and depart from political flashcards to speak candidly on global issues.
During the session, Biden implied that countries like Turkey, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates were supporting Islamic militants by donating “billions of dollars and tens of thousands of tons of weapons” to extremists in the region. It is important to note that the words that triggered Biden to apologize were, in a sense, technically correct. The Obama administration has been negotiating with Turkey to seal off its border with Syria to prevent extremists from funneling in weapons and manpower. The funds of wealthy Gulf nations have found their way in the hands of extremist groups in the region as well. Considering the geo-political ramifications of making allies in the region culpable parties in the rise of the Islamic State, Biden’s apologies attempted to clean up a costly political mistake — not a slanderous slip.
In retrospect, it’s true that Biden should have been more subdued with his words, especially as Obama is attempting to rally allies in a coalition against ISIS. However, the take-away resonates.
Today’s globalized world makes it possible to publicize every text, post or tweet that has ever existed in cyberspace, making it even more difficult for politicians to voice truly honest observations. For taking on that challenge, Biden shouldn’t be made to apologize for his candid comments, especially when they were made to students who are bright minds of the future that could use a little unadorned insight.
Politicians conform to diplomatic norms that no longer facilitate substantive discussions on real world issues. Harvard students — and the rest of the world, for that matter — could have watched CNN, Fox News or any other cable news program to hear the talking points of the strategy in the fight against religious extremists. The vice president gave his honest take on serious issues that the White House must currently deal with, bringing something new to the discussion table.
In a university setting, students look forward to talks from current politicians, writers, thinkers and analysts. Academia thrives on intellectual discussions and critical debate about contentious topics and hot-button issues. If Biden’s remarks came from a speech in the White House Rose Garden rather than in front of college students, the issue would be different. The attacks on Biden are as much directed toward him as they are to the integrity of universities and the community and environment they promote and foster.
It is essential to the development of students and their intellectual thinking that free form discussions be permitted, particularly in the university context. Talks presented by public and notable figures are possible only if they’re free of political implications and diplomatic consequences that could very well restrict the depth and range of the conversation. Political talking heads and TV pundits might perceive Biden’s remarks as a gaffe, but to university students, they offer a glimpse into the way our vice president thinks and the realities of political discourse.
Political mistake or not, open discussions serve students better — and Biden excelled at demonstrating the significance of that.

College Board recently announced changes for the Advanced Placement United States History exam effective fall 2014, a shift that has gained national attention. College Board is a private company that sponsors college entrance exams for students nationwide. The company is most well known for the SAT, a standardized test that measures students’ probability of success in college. Similar to the SAT, AP exams are administered by College Board to test a student’s ability to master college-level coursework in high school.

Though adjustments are part of the improvement process, these new changes to the AP U.S. History exam significantly alter the way history is portrayed to high school students -— in a dangerous way. It is difficult for history to be taught in a way that is completely unbiased, but the changes listed in the new framework establish an overpowering anti-American sentiment based on the representation of America in its worst conditions. The new exam emphasizes American history with reference to racism, false views of superiority over other countries and failure to establish democratic institutions in a timely manner.
When the major reforms to the framework for the exam were announced in July, teachers were told to keep the new structure a secret. It was not until the changes sparked a national debate that College Board president and CEO David Coleman decided to release a full practice exam to the public. Interestingly enough, Coleman happens to be a key player and creator behind the Common Core State Standards Initiative. Common Core, a state-led bipartisan initiative, was created in hopes of increasing the high school graduation rate. It provides a set of guidelines for schools to direct formal education with a special focus in mathematics and English. A large change in relation to the old AP U.S. History exam is based on the elimination of rote memorization. For some time now, states have been pulling closer toward the ideals of the Common Core that emphasize conceptual learning.
California State Senator and major advocate of educational reform Mark Wyland (R-Escondido) discussed the overarching presence of distorted Common Core standards in today’s K-12 educational system.
“If you look at Common Core standards that they are drawing this from, there is absolutely no actual content in those standards — it is only about analysis. It is very, very clear that if you discuss an issue, it should present both sides or all sides of an issue,” Wyland said. “To the extent that a test or curriculum was biased in any way, it’s actually a disservice to students and does not conform to how Common Core is supposed to be. Now, you cannot really look at K-12 education without addressing a part of the Common Core.”
The questions in the new AP U.S. History exam contain pre-existing viewpoints on the way history occurred. It requires students to critically expand on set topics by accepting the viewpoint stated in the question and by supporting it with further evidence. Most of the material in the new exam lacks ideas rooted in American exceptionalism. The changes seem minimal because concepts with regard to an anti-American bias are carried out in a discreet manner.
Though subtle, the issues with the changes are most present in the wording of the questions and topics. The examples that are primarily listed on page 37 of the framework impose the idea of American racial superiority in favor of the foreign settlers. In addition, the curriculum suggests a firm structure of hierarchy, with the Puritans living in a homogenous society and great ignorance on behalf of the English. What the exam fails to mention are the legacies of American heroes who overcame such injustice.
The changes seen in the AP U.S. History exam have continued to spark national debate among teachers, students, religious leaders and state legislators who are unsupportive of the changes.
After a board meeting on Sept. 18, students led a protest at Jefferson High School in Edgewater, Colorado, demanding history to be taught without a political bias. Additionally, students and teachers across the nation addressed their concerns by skipping instructional periods.
Students must learn history through the lens of America’s Founding Fathers to understand various motives and events. To learn the rich stories the past has to offer, future generations shouldn’t begin to believe this form of analysis constitutes thorough awareness of the topic. Rather, students should be taught in a way that encourages analysis in all areas of historical matter, preparing them to realize that even seemingly unimportant and small segments of history are worth learning.
Believe it or not, dear author, despite its greatness, America is not always right. There is nothing inherently anti-American about recognizing mistakes we have made or dark times the country has gone through and insisting that people be aware of them. The only unbiased history is one that makes its pupils equally of both the good and the bad, both the so-called “American heroes” you mention as well as the racism and false views of superiority that you also mention. 
To your credit, you do seem to believe in the importance of “[realizing] that even seemingly unimportant and small segments of history are worth learning.” But you also fail to realize that it’s the very American exceptionalism that you seem fond of that drowns out the opportunity to learn about such things. You gripe that the exam is biased yet you complain that the exam lacks ideas rooted in American exceptionalism… you do realize that to HAVE such ideas would indicate a bias, not the other way around? That American exceptionalism in and of itself is bias? That content rooted in American exceptionalism would also lead to the very “pre-existing viewpoints on the way history occurred” you complain of? 
Perhaps there are valid issues with the new APUSH exam, but I don’t think this article does a great job of articulating them and manages to itself sound biased.

Fantasy football is the definition of unpredictable and this unpredictability can come in a variety of forms. While past posts have addressed fantasy sleepers and fantasy busts, this post addresses a much more pressing issue: injuries.
The season is a long and hard grind and players are bound to get injured. We are through week 5 and predictably, injuries have left teams in need for replacements. These injuries can turn a team that looks unbeatable on paper to a team struggling to win games. While an owner may feel personally victimized because their players are letting them down, don’t start a pity party just yet.
These kinds of things happen and as a fantasy owner, just roll with the punches. With the proper replacements, any roster can recover from an injury. An owner just has to plug in the right player and can limit the damage to a point where they might not even realize that production was ever missing. Here are some of the players at each position a fantasy owner should look to target.
Robert Grififn III was forced to leave the game against the Atlanta Falcons in week 5 due to a head injury. — Evan Vucci | AP Photo
Quarterbacks:
Notable Injuries: Robert Griffin III (Out), Josh McCown (Out)
 Most likely, if a team was relying on Griffin or McCown as their quarterback, they were already in deep trouble. There are just so many other guys out there that are way better. However, if you are really in a bind, try and pick up a guy like Eli Manning or Ryan Tannehill. Both quarterbacks have the ability to have a huge day on any given week and are worth a pick-up if a team is struggling with production at the quarterback position.

Running Backs: 
Notable Injuries: Rashad Jennings (Out), Mark Ingram (Out), Ryan Mathews (Out), Adrian Peterson (Out), Montee Ball (Out), Zac Stacy (Questionable), Knowshon Moreno (Questionable), Reggie Bush (Questionable), Reggie Bush (Questionable), Toby Gerhart (Questionable) 
 This year has been a tough one for running backs. From all the injuries to the lack of performance by many “sure-fire” guys, it hasn’t been easy to get consistent performances out of this position. While many of the guys listed above are only questionable or out for a couple of weeks, those weeks could be pivotal for making it into the playoffs.
Here are some guys to help owners get you over the hump: Andre Williams, Justin Forsett, and Storm Johnson. Let’s start with Andre Williams, who had a huge week after Rashad Jennings went down and he should continue to see the bulk of the carries for the Giants, making him an intriguing prospect as a potential breakout guy.
Justin Forsett has produced very nicely for fantasy owners since being awarded the starting job in Baltimore and he is still available in over 60 percent of ESPN fantasy leagues. While Forsett and Williams have so far proved they can handle getting significant carries, Storm Johnson should get his first shot this week and look for a potential breakout performance.
Get these guys before it is too late and it will most likely solve any running back dilemma a team may have until their main guys get back from being injured.

Wide Receivers: 
Notable Injuries: Calvin Johnson (Out), AJ Green (Out), Cecil Shorts (Out), Eric Decker (Questionable), Mike Evans (Questionable), Andre Johnson (Questionable) 
 With not so many injuries at receiver for the time being, most owners are doing just fine , however if a team does have wide receiver issues, there are still a variety of players to look at.
One guy that could garner some attention with AJ Green being out is Mohamed Sanu. Andy Dalton has been finding Sanu more recently and this has led to serviceable fantasy production. He is only 11 percent owned in ESPN fantasy leagues and could have a major impact in the coming weeks. The second player fantasy owners should target is Brian Quick. Quick is slowly becoming the number one target in the Rams system and has consistently produced at a high level.

Tight Ends: 
Notable Injuries: Tyler Eifert (Out), Kyle Rudolph (Out), Vernon Davis (Questionable), Jordan Reed (Questionable)
With tight ends being relatively deeper than expected this year, there should be no problem in replacing a tight end if one gets hurt. Owen Daniels and Heath Miller are both veteran tight ends that receive constant targets on their team. Look for one of these two to play in the upcoming week because they will constantly be in the receiving picture for their respective teams.

Star golfer Tiger Woods recently said that he is keeping his options very open and may coach himself instead of working with a professional. Although the fourteen-time major champion has won several non-major tournaments in the past few years, he has not won a major since his legendary U.S Open win in 2008.
On the course during the majors, he has often looked like he has been scrambling for his life. He has come close several times since then with nine top-six finishes since his last major, but his best finish in the last five majors has been a tie for 40th. Some say that Woods trying so hard to catch Jack Nicklaus is what’ really holding him back, which may be part of it.

However, a big part of it is also trying to find a new identity and sense of confidence. Identity and confidence means everything in this mental game of golf, but in many ways, a player’s identity on the course is related to his or her identity off it.
Tiger seems to have lost some of his confidence since his memorable scandal.
 “I thought I could get away with whatever I wanted to,” Woods said. “I felt that I had worked hard my entire life and deserved to enjoy all the temptations around me. I felt I was entitled.”
Although this way of thinking was immoral, the notion that he was on top of the world probably fueled his confidence, and is probably a big reason why he was dominating the PGA tour for years.
When you look at video of the old Tiger, you see a man with a Jordan-esque flare, a man who thought he was invincible and played like it.He was full of passion and this passion carried him to victories. He fist pumped with more intensity, he swore and was much more violent with his clubs. Just looking at the way he carried himself on the course, you could tell he was a force to reckoned with.
Where has the 2000 Tiger Woods, who guided his putt to the hole with his finger at the PGA Championship, gone? Where is the Tiger that slammed his hat down at the 2008 Arnold Palmer Invitational? Where is the 2008 Tiger that fist pumped after sinking the putt to get into the U.S. Open playoff against Rocco Mediate?
This wild beast has been tamed, and now, he just looks emotionless and lost when he plays in majors. Since the scandal, he has become a different man, not just in his scores in majors but also off the course. In addition to his struggles in the majors and reducing his anger on the course, he got divorced, his kids are growing up and as far as we know he is faithful to his girlfriend Linsey Vonn.
 Not to forget, Woods has had multiple injuries. The injuries has held him back to some extent, but not nearly as much as his mental game. The possible decision to coach himself may be a turning point; maybe this is the point where Tiger finds a new identity.
Woods started out his career with Butch Harmon from 1996-2004, and worked with Hank Haney from 2004-2010. The last four years, Woods has worked with Sean Foley.
The truth is that the only obstacle standing in Tiger’s way of winning another major is himself. The man has received a great deal of criticism for constantly trying to change his swing after having achieved a formula for success.
Reality is, he does not need a swing coach. This is the time for Tiger to take a step back and stop over-thinking everything.
He can only rediscover the harmony he used to have in the majors on his own; no Butch Harmon; no Sean Foley; nor Hank Haney can give it to him.

The Roski School of Art and Design is teaming up with WIRED magazine and its parent company, Condé Nast, to offer a new online master’s program in integrated design, business and technology. Available in the 2015-2016 academic school year, the 18-24-month degree will feature interdisciplinary approaches to better equip students in the tech industry.
Erica Muhl, the dean of the Roski School, announced the program last Wednesday at WIRED By Design, a two-day live magazine event in Marin, California. This program will follow the interdisciplinary style of many existing programs at USC in which the coursework will be a mixture of classes from the Roski School, the Marshall School of Business and the Viterbi School of Engineering.
According to Muhl, the concept for the program developed out of Roski’s initiative to move away from traditional single-discipline models to multiple-discipline models following the launch of the Jimmy Iovine and Andre Young Academy for Arts, Technology and the Business of Innovation.
“As technology continues to drive business and industry into new areas, the need for similar programs at the graduate level — programs that allow students and working professionals to expand and enhance their current knowledge and skills through a whole new style of thinking — is clear,” she said in an email to the Daily Trojan.
Muhl has also been working closely with the editor-in-chief of WIRED Magazine, Scott Dadich. On behalf of WIRED, he expressed the relevance the new program has in the contemporary technology world.
“Many companies need to be well versed and proficient in design thinking that [this masters program] really can power great leaps forward. Someone equipped with [these] tools [will] excel in an environment we see today,” he said.
Headquartered in San Francisco, WIRED is a monthly magazine that reports on how contemporary technologies affect aspects of modern life, such as consumer behavior, economics, culture, politics and lifestyle. WIRED actively analyzes current trends and forecasts future trends in technology. The partnership with WIRED magazine began when parent company Condé Nast contacted Muhl after realizing the connection between WIRED’s dedication to report innovative technology and Roski’s interdisciplinary visions in the fields of business and technological design.
Dadich explained how WIRED employees — editors, writers and designers — will be joining the faculty alongside USC professors and researchers.
“Eighty percent of the curriculum is going to be generated and orchestrated by USC faculty under Dean Muhl’s leadership,” Dadich said. “Leveraging multiple schools across USC, we’re going to build a really strong curriculum where WIRED folks are going to come in to teach specialties, intensive coursework and capstone programs.”
According to Dadich, the goal is to have 50 to 75 students enrolled for the first cohort.
Muhl further explained the infrastructure of the program and how resources from WIRED will be supplementing the academic content she will help compile on USC’s end.
“The online component comprises academically rigorous online synchronous and asynchronous coursework developed by prominent USC faculty from a variety of disciplines,” she said in an email to the Daily Trojan. “The courses will be cohort-based, and designed to be interactive, taking advantage of WIRED’s rich multimedia resources.”
The program will also include a face-to-face component with a boot camp experience at USC, a residency at WIRED headquarters and opportunities to network with speakers at both WIRED and USC events, according to Muhl.
Albert Montgomery, a sophomore majoring in fine arts, said he might be interested in the program later on, if time and money allow.
“I think it’s great that it’s integrated and [that] it involves becoming familiar with the kind of people from different fields who you might work with in the future,” Montgomery said.
Christina Lee, a senior majoring in art, said she was interested in the exposure and experience the program could offer to students but has no plans to enroll.
“I heard that they’re going to be working closely with WIRED magazine so it’s getting first-hand experience about [what] the professional world would be like instead of just staying within school,” she said.
Both Muhl and Dadich said that specifics for the program have yet to be officially determined. They both feel, however, that the program is a step in the right direction in fulfilling a void in terms of preparing students for the evolving technology industry.
“We see a world changing so rapidly,” Dadich said. “Better-qualified students are coming out of schools. And the better equipped they are to deal with the rapid pace of innovation, the better our world becomes. We’ve seen nothing but progress driven by technology and design thinking, especially in the last 20-30 years. Better-equipped students create better leaders, creating a more connected and powerful community that we all benefit from.”

The USC Center on Public Diplomacy held a Conversation in Public Policy event with U.S. ambassadors to several Asian countries at the Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism on Tuesday afternoon.

The panel was composed of the United States ambassadors to Indonesia, Cambodia, Singapore and Malaysia, as well as the president and CEO of the US-ASEAN Business Council, Alexander Feldman. Professor Gabriel Kahn, co-director of the Media, Economics and Entrepreneurship program at Annenberg, mediated the conversation.
ASEAN, or the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, is a political and economic organization made up of 10 countries that have seen years of economic growth. Over the last few years, increased trading with countries that are part of ASEAN has had a positive effect on the American economy and California’s economy in particular.
The conversation revolved around trade and economics. To open the discussion, Feldman asked the ambassadors if they ever felt it was part of the challenge to overcome the dominance that the China-U.S. trade and economic relationship poses in order to develop a true economic policy geared toward ASEAN.
“The United States invests $200 billion in ASEAN and $158 billion of that runs through Singapore,” said Kirk Wagar, U.S. Ambassador to the Republic of Singapore.
The ambassadors said that they had different economic and diplomatic focuses.
Robert O. Blake Jr., U.S. Ambassador to Indonesia, mentioned the importance of utilizing social networking in nations which do business with the United States. He explained that because Indonesia’s population is largely juvenile, he and his team took part in creating a 21st-century cultural center in Jakarta. The center, named @america, invites young Indonesians to explore and discuss ideas about the United States. These kinds of projects familiarize Indonesians with the United States.
Kimiya Shokoohi, a recent Annenberg graduate, attended the conversation because of her interest in America’s influence in public policy abroad.
“I didn’t realize the magnitude and presence of the U.S. in ASEAN,” she said. “There is a great potential for increased trade in all of Asia.”
Some of the ambassadors stressed the importance of using public diplomacy to help American companies in foreign countries, as well as express humanitarian values. Blake described how in late September a province in Sumatra enacted into law a bill that implements a stricter version of Islamic Sharia law in the town’s criminal law. The law would allow for corporal punishment against homosexual sex on both Muslims and non-Muslims. The embassy’s response was to release a tweet reflecting that in their opinion it was an unfortunate decision.
Blake further explained that American responses like these affect Indonesian business decisions.
“It’s also important for [Indonesian businesses] to know that if they are trying to attract American investment and if they’re trying to attract American tourism, these kinds of things are not going to attract those objectives,” he said.
William Todd, U.S. Ambassador to the Kingdom of Cambodia, concluded the conversation by encouraging the students in attendance to consider a career in foreign service. He explained that one thing all of the ambassadors present had in common was strong enthusiasm for their jobs.
Mary Phung, a senior majoring in international relations, came to the event due to her interest in foreign service and ASEAN.
“I have been interested in joining the foreign service. It was great to find out what kinds of activities our ambassadors impart in,” Phung said.

Harvey Levin, founder and former managing editor of TMZ, visited the Journalism 381: Entertainment, Business and Media class on Tuesday night at the Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism.
Scandal · Harvey Levin (right) managing editor of TMZ speaks as part of Professor Mary Murphy’s (left) Journalism 381 course on Tuesday night. – Kevin Fohrer | Daily Trojan
He led a discussion about the future of broadcast and digital journalism, as well as the ethics behind paying sources for photos and videos.
Professor Mary Murphy, who teaches the class, said her goal in bringing Levin was to show students how his staff goes about finding and running the most talked-about stories of the day.
“He’s driving the entertainment coverage across the entire country,” she said.
Before the class, many students were only generally familiar with TMZ, mainly for being quick at breaking celebrity news scandals. Levin anticipated this, and he stressed that TMZ’s staff vets stories for accuracy and revealed why they are so often the first to run breaking news articles.
“We have more contacts, better contacts, than just about all of the other news outlets combined,” Levin said. “You don’t get these stories by [saying] ‘Oh, I’m out to get you.’ There’s a reason people work with us — it’s because they trust us. The ‘feel right’ thing is a guiding light in what we do.”
After hearing Levin say that his staff considers ethics and possible outcomes of running specific stories each day, some students’ opinions of the news outlet changed.
“I always pictured TMZ as a trashy gossip website, but all of his stories, he doesn’t break unless they’re 100 percent true, so that changes my perception of TMZ,” said Tiffany Luke, a senior majoring in business administration. “Overall, now I do see them more as a legitimate website.”
TMZ has long been scrutinized for paying sources for photos and videos, but Levin defended this practice. Both he and Murphy said that most news outlets do the same thing but not publicly.
“It’s absurd to say that we’ll make money off of a photo and [the source who sent it] won’t,” Levin said. “If a story is important and we think there’s value in the video, we’ll pay for it.”
Levin went on to say that though TMZ is open to paying for photos and videos, the site will never pay for information, which he says incentivizes sources to skew facts and taints a story. Paying for news tips, he said, is a very rare exception.
“It’s kind of refreshing to hear that he’s only paying for media as opposed to flat-out stories and information,” said Ivan Chu, a senior majoring in classics. “I still have a lot of discomfort from it; it still feels like a moral line being crossed, and there’s always the hazard that journalism could turn into people just cutting checks.”
Others were struck by Levin’s strong opinion that television is archaic and will be obsolete in five years. This belief, along with a desire for a newer type of media, is what drove Levin to create TMZ.
“There has not been a sophistication in the news business for 50 years,” he said. “It is the same product, it’s boring and, to some extent, it’s irrelevant. I don’t see the imagination in it, and I don’t see young people going to it.”
Instead of seeing broadcast and digital journalism continue as separate forms, Levin hopes that they will have what he calls a “convergence,” which he thinks young journalists must have the ability to bring about.
“I was definitely going to go the traditional television route, but since he said that in five years, our jobs might not exist, there’s something to reconsider,” said Michelle Tak, a junior majoring in broadcast journalism. “It’s kind of a rude awakening.”
Levin closed by advising aspiring journalists to begin their careers by working for local outlets and to freshen up their content by introducing more youthful ideas.
“Local news stations are looking for young people who can come up with fresh ways of presenting,” Levin said. “If you can do that, you’ll take off like a rocket.”

The California Gamma chapter of Sigma Alpha Epsilon at USC will close for the next three years based on a decision made by the fraternity’s national council yesterday evening.
“Basically their national organization was concerned about the chapter and, after thorough investigation and conversations with members of the chapter, they had reason to believe that the chapter wasn’t upholding the values of their national standards,” said Tanner Sandoval, president of the Interfraternity Council.
The decision was made by the national organization alone. Sandoval said the university was not involved.
SAE’s house on 28th Street, which is owned by the fraternity’s national council, will no longer be occupied by members of the fraternity.
SAE Chapter President Matthew Kasten declined to comment on the matter.
In March, SAE’s national council announced it would ban the pledging process on a national scale due to deadly incidents at chapters throughout the country. At the time, the fraternity had seen 10 alcohol-related deaths since 2006.
USC’s chapter of SAE was put on probation in October 2013 after a Loyola Marymount University student sustained serious injuries from falling off a table at a party at the fraternity house. The university also imposed sanctions on The Row following the incident due to a string of alcohol-related transports.

LavaLab, USC’s student-run entrepreneurial and product design team, hosted its first “Pitch Night” of the semester on Tuesday night. During the event, LavaLab’s nine startup teams presented their current projects under construction. The event started at 8 p.m. and continued until all nine pitches were presented with a small 10-minute break halfway through.
LavaLab’s president Alexander Zhang explained that LavaLab came to conception only a year ago because a few then-seniors lamented the lack of an entrepreneurial drive in undergraduate student organizations at USC.
“Last year, the president of Marshall Business Student Government and two other presidents from other clubs felt fed up that no USC student business club actually [did] stuff. By that I mean there’s a lot of public speaking, panels, networking events but there was no club that kids can leave with something tangible. There wasn’t enough doing and too much talking,” he said.
LavaLab arose from an initiative to encourage student entrepreneurial spirit as well as combine student talent from all different disciplines. There are a total of 30 members in LavaLab out of 140 students who applied. Drawn from a diverse pool of applicants, the accepted students were then divided into nine teams of three or four students each. The selection process for each team consists of recruiting one member who would represent each of the following themes: business, engineering, design and/or the “wildcard” member who has expertise in a little bit of everything.
Having an entrepreneurial idea in mind was not a prerequisite to apply to LavaLab. In fact, applicants were discouraged to have preexisting ideas in order to enter LavaLab with an open mind.
“We actually suggest that you apply with no idea in mind because then it’ll allows for [idea synthesis] to be more organic and more of a group process,” Zhang said.
The LavaLab teams have been working on their respective ideas for a month in what has been deemed as the “incubation period.” The pitch night event consisted of basic demos, pitches and concept presentations. The nine teams were each given about five minutes to showcase their ideas. Each presentation involves problem assessment, business and marketing plan, competition analysis, product conceptualization and even audience feedback for those teams who had a working prototype.
Most of the presented ideas were mobile apps aimed to solve common problems college students face. Ideas included a revamped free and for sale app called “Loop,” an outfit sharing app that gives the user instant feedback on his/her clothing called “Dapper,” an assignments organizer called “cheK,” a device that compiles health data from wearables called “Fitlytics,” and Tinder-esque food app, called “quickChow,” that helps users choose where to eat.
Lea Moret, the project coordinator for “cheK,” explained how the process has been so far for her team.
“We created teams with at least one person who is advanced in coding and a secondary person who is starting off coding, a businessperson and someone into design,” Moret said. Moret’s team already has a prototype of their product and said that they are currently working on the finalizations to prepare for Demo Day, especially focusing on more substantial marketing plan.
The final prototypes of each design will be eventually showcased to the public at Ground Zero in December. Called “Demo Day,” the event will feature representatives from the tech industry as well as potential investors who will attend and judge the projects.
Katherine Xiong, sophomore majoring in architecture, heard about the event from a suitemate. Xiong had not previously heard of LavaLab, but said that she enjoyed the event.
“I came here on a whim … [but] I [became] interested in the presentation of these ideas. I would definitely consider applying and joining LavaLab at a later semester,” she said.
