The seventh-ranked Women of Troy dodged two tough teams on the road against Colorado and Denver, prolonging their undefeated record. They are now one of two teams in the nation without a loss. 
The Trojans (13-0, 7-0 MPSF) initially faced off against Colorado Friday and were triumphant in a long battle that ultimately came down to a game-winning goal by junior attacker Cynthia Del Core in the final 16 seconds, resulting in a 9-8 Trojan victory. 
“We all just looked at each other and we have a lot of trust in each other and we know that even in a close game, if we stick together we can pull out a W,” senior defender Courtney Tarleton said. “I think the biggest thing is not over-thinking any play and just working together the whole time.”
Unlike previous contests in which the Trojans led their opponents by a high margin, this game remained neck and neck for the majority of competition with the score tied 5-5 at the half. 
Five minutes into the second half, the Buffaloes sent a shot into the back of the net to give them a one-goal advantage. With 14:48 remaining, the Trojans countered and regained an 8-7 lead with a pair of goals from senior midfielders Kelsey Dreyer and Amanda Johansen. However, Colorado’s Johnna Fusco rebounded with her third goal of the game to tie the score at eight all. At this point it came down to confidence. 
“The biggest thing was having confidence throughout and not getting away from the things that we’ve been doing all season and making sure that no matter what the score, to just stay confident and stick to our game plan and continue to do the things that we’ve been doing all season,” head coach Lindsay Munday said.  
Following a thirteen minute defensive battle, Del Core executed for the Trojans sending a shot into the back of the net to grant the Trojans their 12th win of the season. 
Despite the USC victory, the Buffaloes in fact recorded more draw controls and ground balls.
“Colorado is a really great team and they were really patient and had a good gameplan coming in,” Munday said. “They beat us on the 50-50 category in draw controls and ground balls so they had more opportunities because they had the ball more. That was something we really wanted to focus on going into Denver, making sure we win those 50-50 categories so we have more opportunities than the other team.
With 12 wins under their belts the Women of Troy faced another strong opponent in Denver, winning 9-6 to maintain their undefeated streak. Junior attacker Michaela Michael grounded the team on offense scoring 3 goals to go along with two assists, five draw controls and three ground balls. Michael has scored 3 goals for the seventh time in her career and had her 23rd career game with 3 or more goals. In addition to a forceful offense, the Trojan defense maintained a strong front, highlighted by a solid performance by sophomore goalie Gussie Johns who had five saves and a ground ball. 
“The biggest thing was being in some uncomfortable positions that we weren’t in so far this season,” Munday said. “Both teams challenged us in really different ways and there were times where our confidence could have been tested.  That’s really a testament to the girls that they stay true to the things that we’ve been doing and that they stay confident no matter what.” 
The Trojans next hit the road Friday April 15th to face No. 13 Northwestern and No. 5 Notre Dame on Monday April 18th.

This semester, the Jesse M. Unruh Institute of Politics will be awarding the first-ever Elizabeth Garrett Award, which will grant funding for an internship to an exemplary female student at USC who excels in academics, public service and leadership.
The Unruh Institute is dedicated to bringing together the academic and practical world of politics through courses in applied politics, speaker series and an extensive political internship program. The Elizabeth Garrett scholarship is the newest award that has been established this year in memory of the late Elizabeth Garrett, former provost of USC and president of Cornell University who died in March from complications of colon cancer.
Dan Schnur, the director of the Unruh Institute, worked with Garrett closely for several years while she served as the provost of USC. They served together on the California Fair Political Practices Commission, she guest-lectured during many of his classes, and Schnur and Garrett worked together to develop the Institute’s scholarship program.
“When Beth passed, everyone at the Unruh institute agreed that something should be done to honor her memory,” Schnur said.
Garrett promoted the institute’s cause by truly bridging the gap between the classroom and the real world of politics, Schnur said. Her academic writings influenced political reform and she continuously applied her academic brilliance to challenges that existed in an off-campus, politically charged environment.
“I had the privilege of knowing Beth Garrett and calling her a friend,” Schnur said. “We want to make sure future generations of USC students can learn from her extraordinary excellence in leadership, academics and public service.”
For the past several years, the Unruh Institute has awarded an increasing amount of money to students who wish to pursue civic-minded internships that might not offer competitive levels of pay.
To encourage these students to pursue the internships of their choice, the Unruh Institute provides internship scholarships which can help a student pay for housing, travel or other related expenses.
The institute has also made a conscious effort in recent years to enable the participation of students from diverse backgrounds in all internships.
When Schnur first came to USC, he noticed that there was a two-tier hierarchy for summer internships in higher education throughout the nation.
Students who came from families who could comfortably pay for tuition had the opportunity to intern at places like the White House, Congress or the United Nations.
Students who struggled financially, however, often had to accept internships with local city offices so they could save money to help pay for tuition. Under Schnur’s leadership, the institute worked to create the internship scholarship program to make sure all students could participate in any internship of their choosing.
“This past year, we were able to award over $100,000 of scholarship money to students for the first time, and considering our annual award amount has been growing steadily for the past many years, I expect we’ll be able to award even more next year,” Schnur said.
Scholarship opportunities are available for students pursuing civic-minded internships in a wide variety of ways including political campaigns, advocacy work, local, state or federal government offices, political journalism and more.

The USC Pharmacy will now have the option to offer birth control following the implementation of the new California Birth Control Law, which went into effect Friday.
The law allows pharmacists to offer birth control products, such as pills, shots, skin patches and vaginal rings, to women without a prescription from a doctor. While the law does not allow pharmacists to supply these products over the counter, women can obtain them after completing a screening questionnaire on their medical history and consulting with a pharmacist.
The statute does not mandate pharmacies to provide birth control prescriptions. Therefore women seeking contraceptives should confirm pharmacies offer the service. The Los Angeles County Hospital will not be implementing the law into its practice.
A similar law that was passed in Oregon took effect in January, but their law restricts use by women under age 18, whereas the California law extends to women of all ages. Similarly, there is not an age requirement when requesting birth control from a doctor.
Before the law was passed in California, women had to get prescriptions from their physician for birth control. Some, such as Elinor Accampo, a professor of history at Dornsife College of Letters, Arts and Sciences, have argued that women who do not visit the doctor to receive birth control are less likely to be screened for cervical cancer or tested for sexually transmitted diseases.
“The one disadvantage to [not visiting the doctor] would be that she doesn’t get the education about all the other forms of birth control and what would be best for her,” Accampo said. “My only concern would be the education factor.”
Ryan Cainkar, a student who participates in USC’s Mobile Clinic club to help administer medical screenings in the local community, believes that the law will lead to more people consider birth control as a viable option and as a result learn more about the topic.
“Although we already have viable options, more accessible birth control will allow for less unintended pregnancies, as well as the opportunity for those that may have never considered it to at least ask questions and learn about the new options that we have been afforded through this law,” Cainkar said in an email to the Daily Trojan.
Many states have sought increased birth control access, based on the consistently high rates of unintended pregnancy. Patrick Whelan, faculty at Keck School of Medicine, responded to a recent study at the Washington University in St. Louis School of Medicine indicating effective contraception reduces unplanned pregnancies and abortions.
“Roughly 50 percent of pregnancies in the United States are unintended, thus occurring in women who are not using contraception or are irregularly using contraception,” Whelan said in an email to the Daily Trojan.
The American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists not only oppose the law, but also seek to create a model explicitly derailing the new law. They have questioned the effectiveness of these laws in California and Oregon, arguing the laws merely replace the barrier of visiting the doctor with another.
The law has undergone revisions from the Office of Administrative Law at the California Board of Pharmacy that require the Board to update their initial statement of reasons. It has also faced opposition from the California Medical Association, leading to an added special licensing procedure and education requirement for pharmacists such as required training.
“Women should have control over their own bodies, and I don’t like the fact that doctors, or the government, would tell women what to do with their body, and a woman should be able to go and get birth control,” Accampo said.
Millions of women have relied on contraception and with more easily accessible medication, it may lead to more women choosing pharmacies over doctor offices.
“It’s a little paternalistic to hold their birth control hostage,” said Kathleen Besinque, USC’s clinical pharmacy professor, to the Los Angeles Times.
In conjunction with the opposition it has undergone from medical associations, religion has surfaced in the discussion of birth control policy. A recent Supreme Court case addressed religious objections to the Affordable Care Act requirement that employers ensure coverage for contraception to all their female workers.
“Religious leaders will increasingly have to answer the question of how they can be opposed to birth control use when it directly leads to fewer abortions,” said Whelan, who is also a board member for the Institute for Advanced Catholic Studies at USC.
The California State Board of Pharmacy argues the law will result in increased access to contraception therapy for women throughout California.
“Combining this access with the pharmacist’s role in patient education and counseling increases the benefit to each woman who elects to take advantage of this new access,” said  Amy Gutierrez, the president of the Board of Pharmacy.

Tensions were high at the Uytengsu Aquatic Center Saturday afternoon with the clash of crosstown rivals, No. 1 and No. 2 in the country, as USC and UCLA battled for the No. 1 spot in MPSF women’s water polo. The No. 1 Trojans took on a double-header playing UCLA at 1 p.m. followed by Redlands at 2:30 p.m. The Women of Troy emerged from the waters as the still-No. 1 ranked team, taking their record to 19-0 overall, 4-0 in MPSF.
To start the day of action, junior driver Ioanna Haralabidis fired away the Trojan’s first goal against UCLA. The Bruins then answered back with a goal from the two-meter position. But the Trojans buckled down on defense with a steal from junior two-meter Brigitta Games and back-to-back saves by freshman goalie Amanda Longan. On offense, the Trojans would take back the lead with a backhanded two-meter goal from Games.
In the second frame, Games out-muscled the Bruin defense to put away another goal from the two-meter spot while senior driver Melissa Bergessen floated one in toward the end of the half. The defense also kept their intensity with steals from juniors, driver Nikki Stansfield and two-meter Avery Peterson. The persistant Bruins would slip in another goal before the half to take the score to 4-2 with USC still in the lead.
Tensions grew at the beginning of the second half where USC head coach Jovan Vavic received a yellow card for encroaching. Despite the yellow card, Vavic’s communication with the team proved successful on a power play drawn by Peterson and converted by sophomore driver Brianna Daboub.
UCLA responded with a goal from the perimeter. Keeping the Bruins in check, Peterson took matters into her own hands with a spin move around her defender to put away another goal to bring the score 6-3. UCLA would then draw an ejection and convert a 6-on-5 goal to close the gap. For the duration of the quarter, USC relied heavily on their defensive game to keep the Bruins at bay with a save and steal from Longan and a crucial shot block by sophomore utility Hayley McKelvey on a UCLA power play. The Trojans would end the quarter on a high note with junior lefty powerhouse Stephania Haralabidis’ power play goal from the outside.
In the fourth quarter, UCLA and USC had a defensive stand-off with turnovers, shot blocks and saves tallied for both teams. Eventually, UCLA would break the silence with a lob goal that was quickly answered back by Stephania Haralabidis on a power play goal with the ejection drawn by Peterson. The Trojans would hold out UCLA for the final 2:50 of play keeping the final score at 8-5.
Peterson highlighted key stops and communication as major assets to their win.
“It was key on defense to stop their big shooters,” Peterson said. “On offense, we focused on our communication and passing to open up our opportunities.”
The action didn’t stop after the victory. The Trojans took on another competitor — Redlands — fresh off the win. This time the Trojans would show their athleticism and talent by shutting out the Bulldogs 23-0, and allowing only seven shots the entire game.
Despite a slow 2-0 start for the Trojans, the heat picked up in the second quarter with the Trojans scoring 11 goals in just eight minutes taking the score to 13-0 at the half. Top scorers of the game were freshmen driver Mackenzie Flath with 6 goals, freshman driver Brooke Presten with 5 and freshman Dagmar Gudmundsson with 4.
“We have great heart as team,” said Longan who totaled 13 saves against UCLA. “When we play, we play for each other and we’re so unified, and that’s what has allowed us to be so successful.”
The day opener against UCLA would mark the beginning of a series of high intensity games against top-ranked MPSF competition for the Trojans.
“We’re going to get in the pool on Monday and fix our mistakes, focus on every gap,“ Longan said. “We need to bring a lot of energy and have the mindset to make our mark.”
Next week, the Trojans with travel to Avery Aquatic Center in Palo Alto to face off against No. 3 Stanford in another big conference match-up.

USC baseball welcomed Utah to Dedeaux Field this weekend in the Trojans’ third Pac-12 series of the season. On the heels of a midweek, extra-inning victory over Pepperdine, USC looked to push themselves to and over the .500 mark in their three-game set against the Utes. After taking the first two games, the Trojans went into Sunday’s contest trying for the sweep.
Senior pitcher Kyle Davis drew the start in the series finale, but the veteran righty struggled through 2 1/3 innings, giving up five runs on six hits — two of them home runs.
The bullpen had been lights out for two days, before imploded spectacularly on Sunday, coughing up nine runs in relief of Davis and putting USC in a 13-run hole by the bottom of the fifth. Junior Andrew Wright, senior Brent Wheatley and sophomore Mason Perryman combined to give up the nine runs over 3 1/3 innings following Davis’ exit.
The Trojans did their best to rally offensively. Senior David Oppenheim drove in three runs on Sunday, plating redshirt sophomore Frankie Rios twice, as well as redshirt junior Reggie Southall. Senior AJ Ramirez crushed a 2-run shot, and juniors Corey Dempster and Jeremy Martinez both chipped in with an RBI apiece. Four Trojans recorded multi-hit days, but they never sniffed the lead, falling 14-8 after scoring 7 unanswered runs.
The series got off to a great start for the Trojans, as redshirt junior pitcher Joe Navilhon enjoyed another career night on the mound. The right-hander fanned nine over seven innings — both career highs — en route to his third win of the year.
“Navilhon has been huge for the first two games of the last two [series],” head coach Dan Hubbs said. “If we get that kind of pitching on a Friday … we’re right where we want to be.”
As Navilhon dealt, the offense spread the love on Friday. Senior outfielder Timmy Robinson, senior infielder AJ Ramirez and redshirt junior shortstop Reggie Southall all chipped in with an RBI apiece, and junior catcher Jeremy Martinez led the team with two runs batted in. Senior Brooks Kriske notched a four-out save to cap the night, earning all his outs via strikeout, and USC opened the series with a 5-2 victory.
Sophomore pitcher Mitch Hart continued his comeback from injury the following day, starting his second game of the season on Saturday. He gave up four hits and a run in his three innings of work and notched his first strikeout of the year before making way for junior Bernardo Flores. The left-hander pitched a scoreless frame before the Trojan bats got on the board.
In the bottom of the fourth, Robinson lined a two-out single up the middle before stealing second base. He broke for the plate when sophomore infielder Angelo Armenta followed up with an infield single, and Robinson slid home safely on an errant throw to tie things at one. Ramirez singled to drive in Armenta and give USC a 2-1 lead.
Armenta raced home again in the sixth to double the Trojans’ advantage on a Southall RBI single. Junior outfielder Corey Dempster then crushed a 3-run shot to extend the USC lead to 5 runs. Meanwhile, Flores continued to cruise through the Utes’ lineup. He put a bow on his impressive six scoreless innings of relief in the ninth, earning his first win of the season by sealing the Trojans’ 6-1 victory.
“I was relaxed, executing all my pitches,” Flores said. “[My teammates] were behind me the whole way, and I just let them do the work for me.”
Being relaxed seemed to be a theme among the USC players this weekend, and their confident approach paid dividends both on the mound and at the plate.
“Everyone’s starting to feel a little more comfortable,” Dempster said. “You relax and just do your job, and if you don’t do your job, the next guy’s going to do your job and pick you up.”
Next up for the Trojans is a visit to Pepperdine on Tuesday. After the rematch against the Waves, they will prepare for a tough weekend road trip to Eugene, as USC returns to Pac-12 play against Oregon.
The team is still fundamentally lacking. The game Sunday was abysmal with wild pitching , and stupid base running/
bunting at the wrong times. Senior pitchers Davis, Wheatly, and Huberman have become a liability when they should
be at their best this season. Pitching guru Hubbs has not done anything to get them back on track. Surprising good
hitting is being wasted too many times. Outhit Utah yesterday yet lose by 6 runs. Looks like team needs to double win
total to make the ncaa tournament.

Last week, the Daily Trojan Editorial Board published an article titled, “Next Trojan athletic director should be female,” offering the basic premise that USC needs to hire a women as athletic director to show that gender equity within collegiate athletics is a priority.
I was shocked that this argument was made. USC doesn’t need to hire a woman as its next athletic director. USC doesn’t need to hire a man as its next athletic director. USC needs to hire the best candidate available. Period. End of story.
Gender shouldn’t be a criterion for hiring the next USC athletic director, nor should race, religion, creed, age or any other tangential, unrelated characteristic. Any trait that has absolutely no bearing on one’s performance or ability to fulfill the duties of his or her job has no purpose being mentioned in the hunt for the next AD. The criteria for the search should be based on actual skills related to one’s job: how well they manage, their experience with compliance, their ability to connect with boosters and other things that actually matter when working. Not whether they have two X chromosomes or not.
I’m not a Neanderthal who believes sports should be played the way they were in the ’40s with minorities and women relegated to shadow leagues. I’m all about women’s sports. I can tell you the last five WNBA MVPs or the top 25 recruits in the 2016 women’s college high school basketball as quickly as I can name the 2005 USC starting offensive and defensive line. Those things matter to me (I don’t know why, but they do). The gender of our next athletic director does not.
I’m pro-women in sports. I’m pro-men in sports. What I am not pro is artificially and synthetically manufacturing progress while sacrificing the quality and caliber of our next athletic director. This is not to say a woman couldn’t do just as fine of a job as a man replacing Pat Haden. It is to say that confining the search based on arbitrary parameters to make a broader social statement has the same end results that barring black athletes from baseball did to the MLB.
It dilutes the end product, plain and simple. The intent is certainly not the same. Barring African Americans from baseball was done by misanthropes and racists who were filled with malice. Calling for a female athletic director has great intentions, as gender equity is an important cause. However, this is the wrong way to go about it. Filtering out qualified candidates in an attempt to find a certain characteristic diminishes the caliber of the overall group.
USC has done a great job of advancing and furthering female sports, with the lacrosse and beach volleyball team as most recent examples. A male athletic director did that just fine, just as I’m sure a woman would have. It is not as if women athletes are systemically treated unfairly or they need women coaches to elevate their game. Look no further than Geno Auriemma at the University of Connecticut, a male coaching a female sport, rewriting the record books annually.
Athletics is a business at Power Five schools, and the hierarchy generally is the revenue-producing sports, men’s football and basketball, and then everyone else. That isn’t gender-motivated, that’s economics.
The Editorial Board stated that since half of USC athletes are female, then half of the administration should be as well. Besides grossly misunderstanding the intent and requirements of Title IX, this conclusion holds no rational basis. Why does a female team need to be coached or administered by a man? Or vice versa? I bet most of the athletes would say they don’t care what gender their coach and administrators are, as long as they help them win games and improve their craft.
I understand the desire to have women representing women’s interests. The empirics and statistics are clear in legislation and policy; women do more to advance their own causes than men do. That’s perfectly logical in politics, but not in sports. Sports are a different animal. Gender doesn’t matter in sports. Winning games does.
Sports are not always like life, and that’s why we love it so much. It’s the greatest meritocracy in the world. You put two teams on a diamond, a gridiron, a rink, or a court and the better-prepared, better-coached, more-talented team wins. That’s equity.
Life, in contrast, isn’t fair. Understanding the distinction between the realm of sports and every other industry is something the editorial board failed to take into account. From competing in high school, I can tell you it didn’t matter to me if my coach was a man or a woman, white or black, Jewish or Christian. Did they care about us? Did they come prepared? Did they put in their best effort? That is the stuff that matters in sports.
That is what all of the Trojan faithful wants, an excellent candidate who can help the Trojan program take the department to the next level and further transcend greatness.
If a woman is the best candidate to replace Haden, I would be just as excited as if it were a male. As long as we have someone who will maintain a compliant program, continue to strive for excellence and make sure football and basketball are perennial powerhouses, I don’t care who they are and what they look like.
Man or woman. Black or white. Christian or Jewish. Tall or short. Fat or thin.
These things don’t matter, all that does is winning championships (the right way), and that is my only requirement for our next athletic director.

Jake, your position on this is so well reasoned and articulated.  I couldn’t agree more!  Though you’ve chosen (perhaps cautiously) to keep the focus of your points centered on USC’s search for its next AD, I will go ahead and say that your argument applies far more broadly.  It is a terrible sign of our times that so many people are so inappropriately preoccupied with the topics of race and gender.  It represents yet another over-correction (traditionally by the Left) to correct perceived injustice. The so-called Progressive is always counting the blacks, Hispanics or women in an often arbitrary, artificial or misguided attempt for inclusion.  The Conservative simply asks who the RIGHT person is, regardless of race or gender.  We must be looking for the most qualified person whether we are filling a job opening, casting for a film, accepting an applicant for college admission, or voting for President.  
I have said it before and I will say it again:  Stop chasing equality!  Stop chasing diversity!  These are two of the most overused and abused words.  Instead, chase FAIRNESS.  Fairness is actually a noble goal, even when not achieved.  Fairness has inherent virtue.  By contrast, equality rarely occurs in life or nature!  What is fair is what’s important.  Sometimes what is fair results in equality or diversity, but sometimes it doesn’t.  So much nonsense and chaos you see and read about today is driven by these misguided notions of equality and diversity.  I understand where it comes from, but it’s not the right pursuit… and Jake does a fine job articulating why.
Hey Jake, if you are so in-tuned with women basketball why not get on the case of Cynthia Cooper who has been a big
disappointment as Women of Troy coach. Since you know the top 25 recruits find out why she can’t get any of them to
attend USC? The program will go nowhere unless they get an impact player to make a difference.

On every second Saturday of the month, Los Angeles’ Chinatown draws Francophile clubgoers to the otherwise quiet area. Nestled between Chinese restaurants with lanterns strung up overhead, the Grand Star Jazz Club is home to Décadanse Soirée French Pop Night, one of many DJ residencies hosted by the venue. For those who love French artists of the 1960s such as Sylvie Vartan and Brigitte Bardot, Décadanse promises a good time and more, showcasing genres like yé-yé, surf rock and swing.
The Grand Star, which has been family-owned since 1946, can be found in the Old Chinatown Plaza, a stone’s throw away from the famous Chung King Road art walk. The club has an upstairs floor available for personal event bookings like birthday parties, but the downstairs dive-style bar complete with a light-up perspex dance floor is where hip locals flock to. The DJ nights at this venue span a range of niche genres like afrobeat, Motown and jazz implied by its very name, but French pop proves to be a standout amid the L.A. dance scene.
The Décadanse circuit, whose namesake is the Serge Gainsbourg and Jane Birkin song of the same name, has been around since 2011 and housed at the Grand Star since November 2014. The events feature DJs who are masters of their craft, evidenced by their personal record collections toted onstage in personalized boxes. Indeed, the warm crackling of the vinyl makes for a retro tonal overlay that complements the music well.
“This is one of the few places you can hear exclusively vinyl sets being played in L.A., especially when it comes to French music,” said Jessica Hardy, who goes by the moniker DJ Fifi Laroux.
Her history of DJing with Décadanse is just a single facet of her musical career: When she’s not spinning records for an ecstatic crowd, she hosts radio shows The Friday Soirée on UC Irvine’s college station, KUCI and Le Show on Pomona College’s own KSPC. Aptly titled, her shows specialize in French music, a genre that strays from her usual preference for funk and soul.
“When I first started my radio shows, I was worried that the genre and theme would be too specific for a wider audience,” Hardy said. “I was actually surprised by the popularity of French music, especially in this city.”
While French themes are often overlooked in an Anglophile context, Hardy is right in that Angelenos seek out foreign media in order to tap into their unique sense of cosmopolitanism. Mark Wright, another ’80s and synthpop-geared Décadanse jockey also known as DJ Pierrot — a nod to the 1965 Jean-Luc Godard film Pierrot le Fou — owns Vidéotheque in South Pasadena, a video store that curates international, indie and cult titles as well as music, clothing and film posters. Wright and other Décadanse DJs often collaborate with the film screening series Cinéfamily and even the cultural branch of the French embassy.
While the L.A. entertainment scene may be rife with French-inspired outings, Hardy and the other DJs sometimes run into pitfalls when combing through record shops to put together quality setlists.
“It’s quite difficult finding French records aside from popular surface-level artists like Serge Gainsbourg in the States. If you really want the deep cuts, it’s just easier to bring them from France,” said Hardy, who tries to regularly spend time in Paris and in the Alps.
The Grand Star’s French club night is a welcome getaway for Angelenos looking for a break from the EDM-centric music scene, as attendees can appreciate the authenticity of the analog format and the personal connection with the hand-picked songs.
“The music we play is lighthearted, fun, and feel-good, and can appeal to people who are into collecting records and the typical vintage sound,” Hardy said.
While the genre may seem esoteric to some, make no mistake: Hardy and the other DJs play along with the crowd, maintaining a sense of humor.
“Towards the end of the night when things get a little more crazy, I might lay down a Stromae record or something more modern from my collection,” Hardy said.
The Grand Star also hosts a British-themed DJ night called Club Underground every Friday, which is organized by Lawrence Gjurgevich of similar Décadanse fame.

The Los Angeles County Museum of Art hosted a discussion on the history of runway shows on Friday night with Tim Blanks, editor of The Business of Fashion, and Booth Moore, a former Los Angeles Times fashion journalist, to kick off the museum’s newest exhibit, Reigning Men: Fashion in Menswear.
The Friday rain couldn’t take away any sort of fashion in Los Angeles. Fur vests, high buns and slick suits filled Bing Theatre shortly before the discussion began. Moderated by Sharon Takeda, the senior curator and department head of costume and textiles at LACMA, the event began by the introduction of Blanks and Moore.
Stunning images were projected onto the large screen from past iconic, historical fashion shows. The 1925 Paul Poiret Couture image of the presentation in his Paris salon showed just how secretive fashion was at this time. No one knew what was taking place in these presentation rooms, journalists weren’t standing around here, and information newspapers received about fashion was because it has been slipped to someone secretly. A timeline of fashion continued; 1944 marked fashion shows resuming after the liberation of Paris; 1967 demonstrated celebrities beginning to sit front row at fashion shows; and 1987 Yves Saint Laurent presented the “supermodel” on the runway.
Blanks explained that other than technology, nothing has changed in the fashion industry. Since there is only a core elite group who get to witness a fashion show live, being present at a show is different from seeing it on social media.
“There is an emotion in the room you don’t get from photos or live watching a show,” Blanks said.
Blanks began attending shows in the late ’80s, and Moore in the late ’90s. Blanks described his first runway show, Yves Saint Laurent, and how it will forever be engraved in his memory. The show featured 180 looks and lasted an hour and a half. Today, fashion shows showcase 30 looks and are over in eight minutes. The fashion world has witnessed a shift because attention spans are shorter and social media allows for everything to be instantaneous. Blanks touched on the graciousness and culture aspect to fashion shows in Paris. He described how shows are “breathtaking, indigestible and magnificent.”
“Fashion is a transience of art,” Blanks said.
In 1990, shows began to look more similar to  exhibitions and art performances. Maison Martin Margiela held shows in an abandoned Paris Metro station as well as a children’s playground. According to Moore, recently, designer Karl Lagerfeld has taken the “fashion spectrum to a new level.” Chanel’s 2014 Fall/Winter show had a supermarket theme, while the 2015 Fall/Winter show exhibited a “casino” presentation.
In the midst of the development of the fashion industry, Los Angeles is becoming a more common place to host shows. In 2015, Burberry held their show at the Griffith Observatory, and in 2016, Saint Laurent at The Palladium.
Conversation on bloggers and celebrities role in fashion were questioned, and Booth concluded that social media gets the clothing out for everyone to see. Everybody can be their own critic now, and has the ability to voice their opinion on social media platforms.
“Is there validity for opinion? Whose voice is right? Fashion excites ridiculous opinion,” Blanks said.
The audience seemed to be engaged and intrigued throughout the hour long conversation, with frequent laughter. Questions from the crowd were taken during the last ten minutes of this event. Blanks and Moore’s passion for their work and the fashion industry was engaging and inspiring.
“Fashion is one of the most fantastic mediums for storytelling,” Blanks said.
Reigning Men: Fashion in Menswear exhibition will run from April 10 to Aug. 21.
Correction: A previous version of this article stated that Booth Moore was a fashion journalist for the Los Angeles Times. Moore is a former journalist for the Times. The Daily Trojan regrets the error.

This past week, Lucasfilm and Disney released a teaser trailer for one of its upcoming Star Wars offshoot films, Rogue One: A Star Wars Story. I don’t pretend to be the biggest Star Wars fan; in fact, I’m not one at all. It wasn’t a series that I grew up with as a kid, although I can recognize the films for both their cultural impact and aesthetic sensibilities. So, when the J. J. Abrams reboot Star Wars: The Force Awakens arrived this past winter, I simply mosied to the theater. I wasn’t in any hurry, but the aspect of it intrigued me. I say all this to assert that I can either take or leave the movies themselves. I wouldn’t be upset if the filmmakers disrespected a character’s foundation or wrote plot holes into a universe that has been watched, read and written about more so than most pop culture artifacts of our time. I am not faithful to the series by any means, which is maybe why I can say what I’m going to say next.
Giving credit where credit is due, Abrams did a great job hiring two “minorities” (as viewed by the Hollywood system) as the protagonists. The fact that the lead Rey (Daisy Ridley) was a woman probably changed the industry in ways we haven’t yet seen. Furthermore, with the addition of Oscar Isaac to film, we have a cast that is as racially diverse as it is fascinating to watch, which is why I can’t believe what I’m about to say: there is a lot to be thankful for in terms of progressive casting and radical change within the industry.
Completely ignoring the fact that the director for Rogue One (Gareth Edwards) is a male with only one big budget credit to his name, I want to focus in on the casting here. Because once again, we’re given quote on quote “progressive casting.” Which it is. Except when you look closer at the details.
According to a quick Google search, Rogue One tells the story of resistance fighters who “embark on a daring mission to steal the Empire’s plans for the Death Star.” The resistance fighters in question are played by British actress Felicity Jones and Mexican actor Diego Luna. Jones shares a lot of similarities with her Star Wars predecessor Ridley. They’re brunette, white and British. And that, to me, is a huge, huge problem.
Even I, as little of a Star Wars fan as I am, know that the other women cast throughout the series have also been brown-haired, white women. Princess Leia played by Carrie Fisher is almost infamous for her porcelain skin and cinnamon-bun rolled brown hair. Natalie Portman’s Padme Amidala was equally fair-skinned and dark-haired. The only black actress to be featured in the Star Wars saga as of now has been Lupita N’yongo, who was turned into the alien Maz Kanata through the use of some spectacular CGI, so much so that it can be said that only N’yongo’s voice was used, and not her face at all.
This is further complicated by the fact that John Boyega, Isaac and Luna are all actors of color. It should also be noted that Isaac and Luna are both Latin actors, which is great, because it means that some producers and filmmakers out there with big, powerful influence have been able to transcend the casting bias that has plagued Hollywood for decades. We are no longer relegated to the white, male actor as our leading man. (At least not in Star Wars.) But that same theory just doesn’t apply to the women involved at all.
While Rey has been viewed as this inspirational, aspirational character to young girls and women everywhere, the addition of Jones to the Star Wars universe unfortunately complicates the problem because the similarities are just too apparent. That same legion of girls who were so inspired by Rey may feel a little confused with the release of this second film, because instead of diversity, the Star Wars filmmakers have now seemed to come up with their own trope: the brown haired, white woman is the only one that can possibly save the day. And if she also happens to have a British accent, then she is more likely of being cast in Star Wars, apparently. Instead of taking the chance to diversify their female leads, the Star Wars filmmakers have done nothing but create and now perpetuate their own stereotype. To be a strong, leading woman in the largest franchise known to date, you must be brown haired, and above all, you must be white. And if you are not, then you will be CGIed to the point of unrecognizability.
Luckily (or maybe unfortunately, because it all still remains to be seen), there are several more Star Wars movies in the works, which means more opportunity to radicalize and inspire, instead of fall into the same pitfalls to which we’ve become so accustomed.

Virtual reality is slowly becoming our reality. The most obvious example of the lines lburring between the screen and our world is the porn industry. It’s been rapidly growing since the emergence of the internet starting with photos and expanded to live webcams. A study in 2008 found that 87 percent of men ages 18-26 and 31 percent of women view pornographic content on university campuses. It’s obvious — the target audience is men. Unfortunately, this means debasing women in the virtual world of porn. This increasing objectification of women illuminates the greater need for conversations about porn in classrooms.
Aggressive sexual engagement becomes the fantasy that porn-watchers find themselves unable to look away from. Peggy Orenstein writes in her book Girls & Sex, “[Pornography] producers have one goal: to get men off hard and fast for profit. That means eroticizing the degradation of women.” The business wants money, and in turn, the viewers receive not only entertainment, but also an unrealistic, even demoralizing, video or photo of sex. Pornography normalizes the use of women as sex objects for the pleasure of men. And this brings up a major problem: Physical sexual aggression that is pleasurable to men but painful for women becomes the general understanding of what sex should be. If this becomes the norm, women and even men will have a harder time realizing when sexual assault is occurring.
A survey conducted in 2014 by the Association of American Universities found that 23 percent of college women experience some form of unwanted sexual contact.  For female seniors attending prestigious universities like Yale and Harvard, this statistic increases to 32 and 29 percent respectively.
But pornography doesn’t cause rape; in fact, rape has dropped dramatically over the past two decades. Porn does, however, give a higher status to men who achieve physical dominance over women whether by force or the threat of force. Two years ago, researchers at the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine interviewed 130 people ages 16 to 18 to find out if porn played a part in anal sex. Both sexes reported that it was likely to be pleasurable for men but painful for women, and many of the young men described pressing their girlfriends to consent even after multiple refusals.
It’s highly unlikely that porn causes this form of sexual engagement. But porn does constitute most young adults’ general understanding of sex. The skyrocketing rise of pornography online has not been paralleled with adequate research of its influence on young adults. Researchers need to study in greater detail how the content is digested in order to understand how it impacts the minds and sexual fantasies of naive and malleable adolescents. An assessment by the Office of Children’s Commissioner in England of 2,304 research papers found that only 79 of those papers drew conclusions from sound evidence. Porn is now neither rare nor pricey, and students are looking to it for answers that sex education does not provide.
Sex and pornography need to be discussed in classrooms without taboo. The discussion should be an open space where students can freely communicate their curiosities to teachers, parents or guardians. Adults, most importantly, must create that space in order for students to feel safe to ask questions or share opinions with their peers. Instead of shying away from sex education — and talking about pornography — adults and the education system must treat this as a sensitive yet crucial topic and begin to hold discussions that promote critical thinking. The longer adults wait in embarrassed silence for kids to teach themselves, the more kids will search for ways to learn about sex. And the one thing adults should be more afraid of than discussing sex with their children is what’s online for young people to find.
Pornography is simply a new way to teach sex in the same way that classroom lessons already integrate technology to better educate students. Christian Graugaard, a professor of sexology at Aalborg University, told The Economist, “Porn can be used to talk about gender equality, safe sex, and the meaning of consent.” Discussions won’t introduce students to porn — because it surrounds them already — but the tide can be turned. As Graugaard believes, “it’s important young people learn to be critical consumers.” Without proper education, adolescents will believe media to be reality.
This is definitely true! Sex education is a MUST nowadays. I read many articles that shows how kids of 10-11 years old are finding sites like 4MyCams and Chaturbate very easy and start visit them and share with their collegues. This will turn out in a very early start of sex lifes and thinking all those things they see on the screed are normal to this world. We need to teach them early in their lives all about these things and also about how to protect themselves.
Let’s say you’re right.
First, the Left will never let it occur.  The Left controls secondary education.  It’s trying to control primary education.
It will paranoically accuse schools trying your idea of objectifying women or peddling smut or use some other politically correct excuse to say teaching healthy sex using porm is a ruse, a guise.   It will never care about your intentions, even were they palatable.
Second, nature itself will never let you.   Men are visual creatures.  And biologically compels men to see women as sexual objects for gratification.  And, of course, they are.
And it’s not about socialization. Men are programmed by NATURE, not by society, to respond sexually to the visual.  This is an area in which men are so different from women that it is probably — no, not probably — outright impossible, for women to truly understand.  
And most elementary and secondary school teachers are women.  And thus unqualified.  (That bit of politically incorrect truth must sting!).
Third, if — as you say — porn doesn’t cause sexual assault, what’s the problem that non-porn methods can’t address?
Is a “control” or “dominate the young male” thing you are seeking.
If it is, I know some great porn that addresses it.

A quick scroll through any Trojan’s Facebook events feed boasts a dizzying number of opportunities to think about the world surrounding our campus. At USC, this week is both Sexual Assault Awareness Week, hosted by the Center for Women and Men, and Palestine Awareness Week, hosted by Students for Justice in Palestine. On Sunday, Carrie Brownstein and Arianna Huffington spoke on campus as part of the L.A. Times Idea Exchange Series. On Monday, the Political Student Assembly is hosting a debate between the College Democrats and the College Republicans. On Tuesday, students will engage in conversation with renowned environmentalist Erin Brockovich. And that’s just the first half of the week.
Whether USC is doing its part to create an inclusive campus climate is another question, but there’s no doubt that the University has continued to provide opportunities for conversation about controversial issues inside and outside the classroom. In an age in which the rise of presidential candidate Donald Trump has created a climate rife with hostility, the University’s commitment to promoting civil discourse among those who disagree is more crucial than ever. However, in light of rising tuition costs, universities like USC must realize that those who would really benefit from institutional diversity may never get the chance to — and this has real implications for national conversation.
The good news for college students is that — regardless of political disposition — many of us hold civil discourse and tolerance in high esteem after graduation. In Iowa, four-fifths of college-educated GOP voters did not vote for Trump, whose ignorant comments and lackluster policy proposals demonstrate a deep misunderstanding about ethnic minorities. In Ohio, part of John Kasich’s victory in his home state came from an ability to bring those with university degrees to the polls. And in Florida, though Trump gained the support of most GOP voters without a higher education diploma, he only garnered 40 percent of those with one.
It’s a deep, deep oversimplification to say that a college education will cure ignorance in America. And it’s an oversimplification to say that all Trump supporters are unequivocally ignorant of the issues, because as our favorite former Celebrity Apprentice host would say, “some, I assume, are good people.”
But a college education is crucial to creating an informed electorate. An environment which fosters even the most simplistic sense of diversity — the presence of people with different backgrounds, ideas and principles — provides a compelling reason to listen to, instead of fearing, those who are different. Curricula that promote the healthy discussion of social issues provides opportunities for those with diverging views to engage with — not talk past — each other. And most importantly, the exploration of these issues provides what the Trump campaign, and many supporters, are missing: nuance.
The rise of Trump clues us into the implications of failing to provide a college education. As a study by the National Student Clearinghouse Research Center contends, rural students lag behind their urban peers when it comes to college enrollment, and poverty plays an even larger role in whether higher education is a possibility for students. Low-income students must face the challenges of subpar schools, a dearth of opportunities and the absence of networks that provide crucial information about higher education. If they make it to college, they’re faced with exorbitant sticker prices to attend school. Applicants to USC this past year face tuition costs at an upwards of $50,000 per year.
And when impoverished rural students — many of whom already live in majority-white neighborhoods — lose out on college, the rise of Trump has proven that this has a profound impact on national discourse.
So the affordability crisis that accompanies skyrocketing tuition at schools like USC is not just a conversation about creating vehicles for social mobility. It’s also about whether high tuition costs impede access to diversity.
College could be the solution to the spatial fragmentation and ideological isolation that has followed the rapid urbanization and suburbanization over the past century. However, if those who really need college cannot access it, then inexplicably high tuition is part of a national failure to provide desperately-needed discourse and engagement.
USC — and universities across the country — need to greater consider the consequences of rising tuition costs, because they don’t just hurt those in need. If Trump shows us anything, it’s that they’re hurting all of us.
The youngest members of my Trojan Family have some “interesting” ideas. 
First, let me point out that USC doesn’t admit all applicants, so reducing tuition won’t help more people get a college education at USC. I can’t say about the other schools out there. 
Second, not everyone should go to college. Some people should be plumbers, electricians, and other trades people. Not only will they struggle in college and be miserable, but we won’t have enough trades people to take care of life’s necessities. Unfortunately, “everyone should get a college education” just isn’t true. Everyone should do something at which they excel. 
Donald Trump is giving voice to people whose jobs were sent overseas, who see the wealthy living the good life while they work two jobs just to survive, and see politicians making promises during elections that are never kept. He’s not the result of an undereducated popation. He’s the result of a population exploited by the wealthy for their personal gain.
When I was much younger, students were being beaten at the Democtatic Convention in Chicago, shot and killed at Kent State, and attacked by police while marching with Dr King. I would like to think our actions made this country better. Now it’s your turn. 
Rather than engage in discourses about those things with which you don’t agree, use the resources with which you are blessed at USC to make the world a better place for everyone. 
It’s not all about you. 
Teddy, very good points for these “I need a safe zone” kids.
Additionally, using Trump as your dartboard of disgust is misdirected. You should be upset at the state of the union , Obama’s presidecy, the old Socialist and the “soon to be charged with espionage” Democratic Party candidates.
The liberals of government and education have failed you. They have indoctrinated you since elementary school, since TV became a major focus of information, to align you to their agenda. You d OK n like Trump or Cruz, but these two candidates are the only “non establishment” candidates available and they will change the way Washington operates.  And it will be done for the betterment of legal citizens.
You say Trump is devisive? President Obama is the most devise elected politician we’ve seen in genetations. The man has done nothing for America other than work to transform America in to some twisted view of his emoti I n ally messed up world.  We are fighting all those who try to make our country something she isn’t. 
We don’t want illegals. We don’t want u vetted refugees from anywhere. There are processes in place for those who want to come here and these processes are there for a reason; to protect our country from those who want to do harm, use our resources and not contribute to the betterment of our society.
Once you get a job and start pay I n taxes, you might see the world in a different light… you might even smarten up a bit and throw away the utopian ideals of liberalism, 2 high really isn’t classic liberalism anymore, and you’ll move towards the political venter if not a tad right of it.  Childrenn, jobs and taxes have a way of opening up ones eyes to the reality of life.  Good luck, and as always… Fight on.
Well.  I guess it’s on me to say it.
You who are about to receive a diploma from this university should also receive an apology from this university.  And a refund of a large portion of your tuition you have paid.
You have been cheated, bilked, propagandized and badly educated.  Your tuition has been much too costly, for which you can blame the federal government and the avarice of the university.  
Washington has produced a bubble in higher education just the way it produced the bubble in housing.   Some government planners decided that too few people owned homes.  So the planners decided to force an increase in home ownership.  They lowered lending standards for people seeking a mortgage.  This produced a glut of sub-prime loans.   And sub-prime borrowers.   And then a crash.  
Next, some government geniuses decided that there were too few college students.  So government made student loans and other tuition subsidies easier to get.  Of course, colleges and universities responded by increasing tuition to capture these government subsidies.  Which is why the cost of college has been rising 4 times faster than the rate of inflation.  
The cost of college has increased faster than the cost of healthcare.  There is now in excess of $1 TRILLION in student loan debt.  There is more student loan debt than credit card debt.  More than auto loan debt.  
Most of you will graduate with debt.  In effect, you will be graduating with a mortgage but with no house.
And what did you get for all of this tuition?  A sub-prime education.
USC students — like students of every other university — study many fewer hours a week than students a generation ago.  But they are getting higher grades.  This too is a result of government creating perverse incentives.  The Government money gives colleges and universities a powerful incentive to admit more and more students.  Inevitably this means more and more students who are  marginally qualified — or  unqualified,  Many of these will pay tuition for a few semesters and then leave school with debt but no degree.  Others will plod along, paying tuition, piling up debt, and eventually getting a degree, but not in four years.
If you major in gender studies, or women’s studies, or ethnicity studies, or cinema deconstruction, or any other of today’s fads,  I have this advice:
When you take off your cap and gown at graduation, do not look for a job.   Instead go straight to the unemployment office.  This university did not equip you to add value to the American economy.  
Soon, this university ‘s office in charge of alumni giving, will contact you and ask you for money.   Your response should be, “Are you kidding?”  Instead of sending money to this university, just send a schedule of your student loan repayments.  If this campus is like most campuses, you have been living in a community of enforced conformity.  When you leave and enter the real world, you are in for a shock. 
You have paid USC for a speech code.  It has forbidden and punished speech that  did not conform to fashionable political pieties. 
You have paid lots of money for USC to teach you that you have a special entitlement —  that you are entitled to pass through life without hearing any speech that annoys, depresses, confuses, offends, or otherwise distresses you.
Like other campuses, you have paid tuition for USC to have a “free speech zone” – a small , isolated inconvenient space where students are allowed to exercise First Amendment rights.  I don’t exactly know where it is.  But guess what?  Off campus, out in reality, nobody recognizes this entitlement.  You will find that the US Constitution makes the rest of America – all of it –a free speech zone.
This school has restricted free speech in order to protect your tender sensitivities and to protect your feelings from being hurt.  When you leave this campus, you will have to “un-learn” the silliness that you have been taught here.  The idea that you deserve to be treated as a frail flower.
So students of USC, you have been saddled with debt and bad ideas. Good luck.  You’re going to need it.
