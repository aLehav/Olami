Carrying the listener through the banger-filled pop universe of one of South Korea’s most talented songstresses, Chung Ha’s first full-length debut album “Querencia” delivers a tracklist unlike any of her previous EPs. The generous 21-track album combines Latin-infused K-pop, dance house music and vulnerable ballads, offering versatile sounds that ensure everyone can find comfort in Chung Ha’s world.
“Querencia,” meaning “a place from which one’s strength is drawn, where one feels at home” in Spanish, brings the power of K-pop to a global audience with genre-bending tracks unlike anyone has heard before. 
Chung Ha previewed the album with the single, “PLAY” featuring South Korean rapper, CHANGMO. The track intertwines a catchy Latin pop beat with Chung Ha’s charisma, accompanied by a colorful music video paying homage to Latin culture. The vibrant single along with the Spanish album title hinted that Chung Ha can’t be confined to just K-pop; she’s dominating Latin America too. 
Continuing the Latin rhythm, Chung Ha brings the Latin flare to her alluring track “Masquerade,” where she entices a lover to search for her. The salsa-inspired song makes her out to be elusive and mysterious. Indeed, she is, because the album comes with many surprises. The Latin-infusion doesn’t stop at the rhythms. 
“Demente,’’ featuring Puerto Rican rapper Guaynaa, solidifies Chung Ha’s versatility as she flawlessly sings in Spanish and Korean over a Reggaeton beat, “Cada vez que me acerco tu amor se escapa / Y me deja’ toda sola, empapada / Con las lágrimas como llamas.” The Latin-Korean collaboration plays on the album’s promise to deliver a place of ease for everyone and exceedingly fulfills this, bringing her talent to not only her fans but prospective listeners worldwide.
The Dallas-raised singer expands her reach, debuting two fully-English tracks on the album. Seducing the listener with her soothing voice and charming lyrics, Chung Ha takes on a more retro pop sound with “Dream of You.” 
Chung Ha sings, “I want you and I know you want me too / So now no more games, come through / And I’ll make your dreams come true,” with an assertive presence that’s sure to captivate pop-lovers. 
The other English track on the album takes a more vulnerable tone, documenting a failing relationship where her partner stays weighed down by their emotions for an ex, and she remains hopeful while “Flying on Faith.” 
Continuing to touch on multiple genres and themes, “Querencia” is conveniently split into four sides – “Noble,” “Savage,” “Unknown” and “Pleasures” – each marked by one-minute interludes. 
“Noble” opens the album with an approaching bass and metal-clanging sound that introduces her new hip-hop single, “Bicycle.” She confidently sings and raps asserting her dominance on the sensual track, “Come on, I’ll slay you from the tip of my tongue / You wanna know? And know what she likes? / Sit back and watch me ride.” Reaching the likes of Ariana Grande and Nicki Minaj’s “Side to Side” with the bicycle-riding metaphor, Chung Ha presents her own twist as the self-proclaimed “baddest queen.”
“Savage” introduces a new subset of songs with a catchy house beat that fades into her acclaimed single, “Stay Tonight.” The star brings the listeners back to the ’90s with the sparkly, vogue-filled music video and club instrumental. Named one of the “35 Songs That Helped Define K-Pop in 2020,” the song is sure to remain a stamp in Chung Ha’s catalog. 
Transcending beyond genre and theme experimentation, “Bother Me,” also one of the best songs on the album, explores time by combining a signature ’90s instrumental with her melodious vocal riff. 
“Unknown” uses squeaky and clanky sounds combined with a piano riff to introduce songs like “PLAY” and “Demente.” Also on this side is her ironically sweet tune, “Lemon,” where she sings to her lover and gives listeners a feeling of bliss, “Baby I need your love, lemon, lemon.”
Transitioning into the ballad-filled side of “Querencia,” “Pleasures” sets up for a vulnerable Chung Ha. “X” describes her feelings of both self-assurance and reminiscence as she narrates a breakup that’s surely going to leave her ex regretful as she sings, “You should’ve loved me at my worst / Now you just watch me on your TV screen.” Followed by R&B and slow jams, Chung Ha takes listeners on an emotional journey to finish off the album.
Beginning her music career on “Produce 101,” the Korean music competition show that placed her with former group I.O.I, to now releasing her debut album, “Querencia,” Chung Ha’s a pop star to ride with. “Querencia” brings exactly what the title promises, a place of strength. The star empowers both fans and the global audience through Latin-Korean fusion, house music, R&B and everything in between, making her 21-track album a safe haven for everyone.

A young Pearl Malik found her happy place in the confines of her room, falling in love with Bollywood films, one after the other.  She was, as Indians would call it, filmi — infatuated with the world of film and everything it represents. What started as shooting short home videos on her camcorder and editing them on iMovie translated into a series of incredibly beautiful short films that have garnered her several hundred thousand views and an impeccable social media presence. 
Malik, a junior majoring in film production, was first exposed to socially provocative filmmaking when she worked on a three-month-long project with a nongovernmental organization to record the lives of children experiencing homelessness on Indian railways. Collating stories of drug abuse, runaways and forced labor, Malik realized the importance of amplifying these voices. Her venture into real and authentic storytelling is what lamented her love for socially critical films. 
“The kind of films that I’m going to make are genuinely going to be a very strong reflection of the society we live in,” Malik said. “We’ve lived in a fantasy world for extremely long … We don’t have enough content that makes us realize the small little hidden gems in the society that we live in.”
After releasing her short form documentary-style videos called “Quarantine Tapes,” Malik blew up on Instagram. Watched by thousands of people across the world, the mini tapes brought the inner worlds of celebrities and their honest quarantine thoughts to life. The love for her content helped create a community of over 18,000 ardent followers. 
“Why I did this was also to humanize famous people,” Malik said. “We don’t realize that they’re people too at the end of the day; they were going through the same things that we were.” 
It wasn’t until lockdown that Malik realized the power that social media has to reach people everywhere. 
“It doesn’t judge you based on what kind of art you create, what kind of audience you have. You basically can start from scratch and grow into millions, just as someone else can,” Malik said.
The tapes are conversational pieces that bring us a step closer to the lives of incredible people. From Indian Drag icon Rani KoHEnur’s journey as a proud member of the LGBTQ+ community to fashion designer Masaba Gupta and her journey as a mixed-race fierce woman in a tough industry, every tape that Malik films establish a vital narrative that is essential to talk about. 
As a child, Malik was socially anxious. She was quiet and camera shy and experienced bullying in school. It was during those times that Malik’s mother and mentor, Ritu Malik, said her daughter truly began to express herselfthrough her art. 
“She started expressing her opinion about bullying … which nobody usually speaks about,” Ritu said. “She never told me about it, but she handled it by expressing it in her media.” 
Malik’s mother stressed how important the environment of her household was in raising the strong woman that Malik is today. 
“Our household is dominated by women, Pearl has always seen very independent women around her,” Ritu said. “We are also very expressive people.”
Today, Malik is a relentless force of energy. She has built networks with some of the most talented people within the Hindi film industry and is creating content that she is passionate about and unafraid to put out. 
Sharing vulnerable content that’s honest and personal to her is an essential part of Malik’s filmmaking. Her short film, “Film School Rejects,” is a reflection of her own inner battles with depression. 
“I didn’t make [posting vulnerable content] a big deal in my head, because then I would be scared to put it out there. I was like, ‘What if people judge?’” Malik said. “That’s a fear that someone with a mental health issue constantly has.”
Malik said that much like her, many other people too are bottling up their feelings in the fear of being judged. However, the messages she received from viewers who related to her struggles made it all worth it. 
“The response that I got in my DMs, around 300 people on the day itself, who messaged me and spoke about their stories and spoke about how this felt very close to their heart,” Malik said. “I swear to God, I have never felt that happy.”
She believes that showcasing content like this is not just a cathartic experience for the many that have bottled it up much like her; it is also essential to drive the conversation in our communities. 
“The pain is not physical; it’s not something tangible, you can point out where it is,” Malik said. “Seeing a physical representation of your emotions is actually very therapeutic. And that I could make other people feel that, felt really amazing.” 
Malik first experienced social media criticism when she opened up about her battle with bipolar disorder. 
“I decided that I don’t want to be ashamed about it anymore and I want to make a short film about the struggles, but it was reported multiple times that very day,” Malik said.
With the film taken down, Malik felt as though her voice, her moment of brave vulnerability, was squandered. 
“I was genuinely heartbroken about it,” Malik said. “Especially since this is the first time that I allowed myself to openly say that I go through something like this.”
Malik’s experience with the gut-wrenching side of social media inspired her to create her most recent piece of work, “Behind closed doors” — a film about victimization by social media bullying.
Anveshika Sahi, the lead actor of the film, discussed how Malik sat her down to talk about how she wanted the story told to the world and the personal importance of bringing the narrative to a larger audience.  
“It became even more personal, and throughout the process, in every single thing that we did, I felt like we were doing this not just for ourselves but for a lot of people out there,” Sahi said. “And that’s something that was beautiful.” 
Malik has realized that a part of putting your work out there in today’s times is being subjected to undue hate.
“You can’t control other people’s reactions to the way you live life,” Malik said. “At the end of the day, they’re faceless people sitting behind the screens, and their opinion cannot change the way that I look at myself.”
Malik believes that an essential attitude that should be adopted by everyone is to be shameless. 
“When you become shameless you don’t fear how other people will react,” Malik said. “Have zero shame in promoting yourselves.” 
In this incredibly tough and competitive industry, Malik has truly carved a space for herself. From making sure she controls her creative autonomy to gracefully refusing work that doesn’t align with her creative vision, Malik has proven to be this unbelievably strong powerhouse. 
She recalls her father’s keen advice as something that’s stuck with her since she was young —  as well as a piece of wisdom she’d like to pass onto others. 
“You need to realize your worth, your work’s worth, and then no one can take you for a ride,” Malik said. “If you don’t have confidence in what you’re making, no one is gonna take you seriously and even if I don’t have confidence in myself, I put on a face that I do.”

Following the release of the expository and scandalous made-for-TV documentary, “The New York Times Presents: Framing Britney Spears,” the 39-year-old pop star is the celebrity on everyone’s mind.
The documentary follows her rise to stardom and subsequent public downward spiral, narrowing in on Spears’ legal battle with her father, Jamie Spears, over control of her finances, estate and person. The film positions the mainstream media and Spears’ money-hungry father as the architects of her downfall, a narrative that is both plausible and compelling. We see the detrimental effects that paparazzi presence, gender roles and the music industry have on her life and the resulting call to action is easy to get behind: We can all agree, wholeheartedly, that the treatment of celebrities like Spears is ethically unsound and a complete violation of privacy.
In a hearing last Thursday, Mr. Spears lost his bid to retain complete control of his daughter’s finances, a positive first step in a murky legal battle and an indication that the #FreeBritney movement is turning heads. But what struck me about the documentary was not the legal minutiae; it was what the story revealed to us about where we’ve made strides and where there is far more work to be done.
The mainstream media treated Spears in a way that would never fly in 2021. Despite her young age and exceptional talent, she was covered almost explicitly in the context of her sexuality, and gender biases rendered her an easy scapegoat for women everywhere. In an infamous 2003 interview with Diane Sawyer, the broadcast journalist blamed Spears for the demise of her relationship with then-ex-boyfriend Justin Timberlake; Sawyer also chastised Spears’ promiscuous performance style, insinuating that she failed to be a role model for young women. Spears explained that she felt “comfortable in her own skin” and that “it’s an okay thing to express yourself,” but hey, who cares about all that, right? Spears was 22 at the time. 
In another particularly jarring moment captured in the documentary, a European interviewer interrogated a then 17-year-old Spears about her breasts and whether she had implants. Gross, I know. My jaw dropped so fast — I thought I must have heard wrong; there was no way an interviewer would dig his own grave so readily. My reaction to the clip, though, points to an important cultural development: Our collective moral social media compass has evolved, at least to some extent.
Today, there is a fat chance you would get dragged for speaking to a woman artist like that. Probe her love life or sexuality in the place of a career-oriented inquiry and someone is coming for your jugular — expect a Twitter army, resurfaced incriminating clips and prominent public figures ready to denounce your career faster than you can say “misogyny.” 
For instance, when gossip blogger Perez Hilton criticized a then 15-year-old TikTok influencer Charli D’Amelio for dancing to a song in a bikini in March (“Anyone else think it’s inappropriate for a 15-year-old to dance to this?” he posted), the backlash was swift. Hundreds of thousands of fans of D’Amelio, the most-followed user on TikTok, successfully petitioned to have Hilton removed from the platform. Of course, D’Amelio is literally a child, but so was Spears when the media shamelessly picked her apart.
Through this discrepancy, the evolution of our relationship to celebrity internet culture is evident. We now understand the consequences that misogynistic publicity can have on young women in the spotlight and actively work to circumvent these effects. We question biases and incentives; we villainize those who exploit the lives of others for personal gain.
That being said, we still far too frequently see this archaic breed of one-dimensional criticism directed at women celebrities of color, particularly Black women. The past few weeks on social media alone are telling of how we fail to afford Black women the same respect and consideration as their white counterparts.
Rapper Megan Thee Stallion, who was allegedly shot by rapper Tory Lanez last July, has been forced to repeatedly defend herself against baseless rumors. On Jan. 21, in an attempt to dispel false reports that the assault charges against Lanez had been dropped, she tweeted: “AT THIS POINT IM GETTING ANNOYED ! STOP BELIEVING EVERYTHING YOU READ ON THE MF INTERNET. Imagine how I feel waking every day seeing people LIE and turn my trauma into a joke ? That whole team figures out ways to create doubt with my story every week and the media eats it up.”
Conspicuously, no Twitter army backed her up. 
Just last week, a rumor that Lauren London, actress and girlfriend of deceased rapper Nipsey Hussle, was pregnant ran amok on the internet. I can’t even count how many tweets I saw that criticized her decision to have another baby before the story was even vetted for legitimacy. Aside from the obvious fact that how London chooses to move on from her partner’s death is her prerogative, the rumor was also fabricated. London took to Twitter to say, “Woke up to some straight bullshit. Rumors ! Lies ! On a woman trying her best to heal?! Please stop. I’m NOT pregnant.” 
Again, the Twitter army was nowhere in sight.
Lizzo, Black woman artist and Grammy award-winner, has been subject to public scrutiny and judgment as well as fatphobic and body-shaming rhetoric to an extent that no white plus-sized artist can conceive of. This is not an accident. Sure, our collective moral compass may have evolved, but who does it serve? And at what cost? While we watch “Framing Britney” and gasp at the presumptive and misogynistic nature of her critics, subsequently turning to white public figures like D’Amelio as reassurance that we have progressed, it can be easy to forget about those we have left behind.
I want to reiterate that I think “Framing Britney” is an exceptional production, one that I believe will go a long way in righting long-standing wrongs and drawing attention to the implications of celebrity internet culture. However, this documentary, along with the treatment of media coverage in the 21st century as a remnant of the past, comes the erasure of the lived experiences of Black women today. It is worth thinking about why we have failed to keep the same energy across the board and what it will take for us to recognize what is a glaring and discriminatory media bias.

When the pandemic started last spring, Troy Bonde had the idea to create a “thermo-sanitizer,” a device that allows users to take their temperature while sanitizing their hands, to improve workplace safety amid the coronavirus pandemic. As his idea grew, he knew that Winston Alfieri, his good friend since kindergarten, was the ideal person to team up with. 
The pair created NextPace Ventures, a sanitation solutions company that offers thermo-sanitizers to make workplaces and institutions safer for individuals. Since the company was founded in July 2020, NextPace Ventures has sold over 2,000 units across Southern California to school districts, businesses and nonprofits. 
Bonde, a junior majoring in business administration, first became interested in business during high school. His cousin, a USC graduate medical student, recommended that Bonde sell medical gloves and masks because of its consistent high demand, even before the pandemic. Although Bonde was not able to sell any of the medical supplies, he gained contacts in Asia in the medical manufacturing base because of his high school business idea. 
Following the University’s closure last March due to the coronavirus pandemic, Bonde began brainstorming ideas for the eventual reopening of campus. 
“[During spring break] is when we first started brainstorming how we’d even be able to go back to class and, would we have to have everybody have their temperature taken before going into the classroom,” Bonde said. “We figured, what if everyone’s sanitizing their hands and everyone’s having their temperature taken, why not have something that cuts that process in half, and is the two in one device?”
After reaching out to his contacts in manufacturing and creating the device, Bonde made his first sale with the Glendale school district by looking for the school directory online and sending emails to as many faculty members as possible until he got a response. He then reached out to Alfieri, a junior majoring in real estate development, to form a partnership. 
“If we have good ideas, we’ll just come up with them together,” Alfieri said. “We have a good friend relationship [where] we can talk about anything and go through any obstacles. Sometimes people just don’t get along, [but] Troy and I get along really well so …  our business ideas are almost …  intangible, so they go hand in hand.”
Bonde and Alfieri knew that the odds of getting responses from potential clients were low, but discovered the key to making sales was being persistent and reaching out to many different clients. The pair said that most of the clients they have today were initiated from a cold email.
“We joke that our company essentially has $0 spent in ads,” Bonde said. “There were a lot of long nights, just sending emails, drafting emails and then sending them out in the morning. There was a point where we were probably averaging a couple hundred emails a day.” 
To organize the large amounts of emails they were writing each day, Bonde and Alfieri created a spreadsheet listing every single email they were sending out and documenting responses. The spreadsheet was categorized by industry, mainly targeting schools, urgent cares, hospitals and hotels, including Best Western International. 
“We do supply sanitizer and our thermo-sanitizer in Best Westerns from the USA to Canada. That was one of our biggest things,” Alfieri said. “The more emails we put in, the more work we put in, the more traction we saw on our end.” 
Many NextPace Ventures clients have enjoyed the non-invasiveness of the device and the efficiency of combining temperature checks and sanitizing with the thermo-sanitizer, especially in the hospitality industry. 
“When you’re using the handheld thermometer, … it’s almost like a symbol of a gun at someone’s forehead,” Bonde said. “What Best Western loved about it was that it didn’t show that symbol. It wasn’t invasive in your space, and it worked more for the hospitality business … They felt more comfortable using our products.”
Chris Zbreneck, who works at Monstore Garages, a storage facility in Palm Springs and is a NextPace Ventures client, said he is pleased with the device and likes that it gives a feeling of security for those working in the facility and the customers coming in. 
“We keep it by the front door and customers that come in want to know what it is, if they haven’t seen it before,” Zbreneck said. “It also gives a peace of mind to us sitting here in the office that someone’s coming in and [taking] their temperature, and then they can also use hand sanitizer below it.”
As NextPace Ventures grows, Bonde and Alfieri, who continue to run the business completely on their own, have shifted their focus from finding new clients through mass emails towards customer service. 
“It was just interesting to see if we spent 24 hours a day sending emails, we’d have had 10 times the sales we have now,” Alfieri said. “Honestly, the harder we work, the more sales we get, so it’s honestly on our part.” 
Bonde and Alfieri hope that one day they will see USC as a client and see their product around campus.
“We’re hoping that USC might consider [it], which would be awesome. It’d be great to be walking on campus and see our products being put to work,” Bonde said.

Haley Ho was in middle school when she took her first graphic design multimedia course. Falling in love with the field, she did not always think it could be an employment path for her. 
This changed, however, when Ho, now a freshman majoring in arts, technology and the business of innovation, learned about user experience, or UX, design. UX design focuses on functionality and user interaction, such as how it feels in someone’s hand or any emotional reaction its design could evoke.
“I found out … that UX design, in particular, was a field, and it was a growing one that people were actually getting jobs in,” she said. “I felt like it really aligned with my interests in  human behavior, visual art and design.”
Over the summer, Ho put her interest in UX design to practice by designing a T-shirt, inspired by a desire to bridge global experiences of the pandemic, for a design contest. Ho found out about the contest  from the Instagram stories of other students she met during the Iovine and Young Academy’s interview weekend. The contest, hosted by Fundamentals, a community brand based in New York, was a T-shirt design contest open to incoming college students. The winner would get a $5,000 scholarship to put towards their education. 
Loren Gutierrez, co-founder of Fundamentals, said she was motivated to host the competition by her own experiences as a low-income college freshman. 
“My co-founder and I both had received financial aid when we went to our universities so we knew [how essential] a need it was, especially with COVID. We wanted to do something geared towards incoming college students,” Gutierrez said. 
Gutierrez, a recent design graduate from Syracuse University, founded Fundamentals with her friend, Brian De La Cruz, over the summer due to the political climate at the time. While attending Black Lives Matter protests, she found herself wanting to do more to help the movement and decided to start making shirts to sell at protests in her community.
“[De La Cruz and I] used [the proceeds] to buy snacks, water and PPE for the protesters,” Guiterrez said. “We realized we were getting a lot more support than we anticipated, and we had a lot of money, so we were like, ‘Okay, what do we do next?’”
Following the success of their shirts Gutierrez and De La Cruz decided to create grants for small Black- and brown-owned businesses in their community, before deciding to give back to incoming college students through their competition.
When Ho saw this opportunity, her mind went to an oil painting sketch she had worked on for a high school assignment earlier in the year. 
“I didn’t get to finish the oil painting because my school shut down just as [we got the assignment] and I felt kind of unsatisfied.,” Ho said. “I felt like I could use [the design] somewhere just because it’s so relevant to what’s going on right now.”
The front of the shirt says “twenty twenty,” the identical words mirroring each other, referencing the start of the pandemic. The design on the back of the T-shirt features a ramen bowl, a deliberate choice by Ho.
“I initially gravitated towards the concept of using a ramen bowl to represent the coronavirus situation because I remember, at school, the overarching narrative about the coronavirus was that is was in China, it was in Asia, it was just contained in Asia — it wasn’t going to come to the U.S. necessarily,” Ho said. 
There are many smaller designs within the ramen bowl, each representing something about the coronavirus, including a small cruise ship sailing in the noodles and Princess Cruises’s logo on the outside of the bowl. 
“[The cruise ship]was supposed to represent the initial cases that came to the Bay Area and the U.S.,” Ho said. “That was the time I started to panic about the coronavirus, but I didn’t know if my concerns were valid because no one else was super concerned at the time.”
Stephen Child, an associate professor and chair of design at the Iovine and Young Academy, taught Ho in her first semester, in the course “Rapid Visualization.” The course is required for first-year Academy students and teaches the fundamentals of product drawing, with an emphasis on quick sketching. In the course, students focus on “the creative problem-solving process.” 
“She was very good in the class, one of my best students in this area,” Child said. “Her creative ability was present in the class. She solved problems in an interesting and creative way.”
When Gutierrez saw Ho’s design, she was intrigued by its relevance. 
“We thought the [ramen bowl] was very interesting and very different. [Haley] wanted to shed light [on] the Asian community, but also you can look more closely to see the details and the seriousness of [the pandemic],” Gutierrez said. “It was very intricate and different from all the other designs we received.”
Fundamentals selected Ho as one out of five finalists. Then, each design was posted on Instagram, and the winner was chosen based on the number of likes each post received. 
While Ho did not win the scholarship, Fundamentals still sold her design on their t-shirts. Through word of mouth and social media promotion, Ho received $600 in sales. 
Inspired by the continuing coronavirus pandemic, the Black Lives Matter movement and her hometown of the Bay Area, Ho donated these funds to SF New Deal, a non-profit organization that provides supportive services and financial opportunities to small businesses in San Francisco affected by the pandemic. For Ho, her decision to donate to SF New Deal “made a lot of sense” because of the shirt’s ties to the coronavirus and the organization’s work in her hometown. 
“There were also so many things going on related to things like the Black Lives Matter movement and other social justice movements that I felt like keeping all the proceeds to myself just didn’t feel right,” Ho said. “I wanted to take action in some way.”
According to SF New Deal chief operating officer Jenais Zarlin, Ho’s donation provided 60 meals prepared by local restaurants to people experiencing food insecurity. 
In addition to helping her community, Ho is thankful for the opportunity for her art to make an appearance in public. 
“Anytime I see someone wear [my design], it makes me happy that my work is physically out in the world,” Ho said. “Seeing it being worn was a really nice feeling.”

Following the death of George Floyd, Black students created the @black_at_usc Instagram page to share instances of racism and microaggressions at USC. Several posts on the account claimed that former Undergraduate Student Government President Truman Fritz engaged in racial misconduct. 
In response to these allegations, Abeer Tijani, a senior majoring in global health, called for Fritz’s immediate resignation due to his racially insensitive behavior. Despite having reached out to Fritz and Ritch on multiple occasions, Tijani was left ignored by the two. She then helped lead efforts on her Instagram account to impeach Fritz and Vice President Rose Ritch due to her complicity. 
Fritz resigned July 7, three weeks after Tijani filed a formal impeachment complaint. 
Tijani also briefly mentioned Ritch’s history of supporting pro-Israel groups on campus to the detriment of Palestinian students. Tijani’s criticism of Ritch’s Zionist beliefs sparked social media outrage amongst students. 
Ritch resigned August 6 in a letter addressed to the student body. 
“I have been told that my support for Israel has made me complicit in racism, and that, by association, I am racist,” the letter read. “Students launched an aggressive social media campaign to ‘impeach [my] Zionist a**.’ This is antisemitism, and cannot be tolerated at a University that proclaims to ‘nurture an environment of mutual respect and tolerance.’” 
Tijani addressed the situation prior to Ritch’s resignation, stating she primarily asked for her impeachment, not because of her Zionist views but because she did not condemn Fritz’s actions and microaggressions. 
The resignation of Ritch sent USG into a whirlwind of chaos. USG now had the attention of the student body and its restructuring began soon afterwards. 
TRANSITION OF POWER 
According to the USG bylaws, the order of succession following the Vice President is the speaker of the Senate. Gabe Savage, a senior majoring in philosophy, politics and law, transitioned abruptly from the speaker to the presidential role following Ritch’s resignation. 
 “For two weeks or so, I was every role in the executive cabinet, which wasn’t fun,” Savage said. 
In addition to juggling multiple positions, Savage organized the selection of the new vice president along with replacing the entire executive board which resigned. He decided to hold a meeting for senators to make their case for the position, and then the senate voted by secret ballot. Trinity Moore, a junior majoring in business of cinematic arts, won with eight votes out of twelve. 
Moore has been a part of USG since her freshman year, but she said she never saw herself on the executive board. 
“Being a senator over the summer at the time of everything happening was very eye opening,” Moore said. “It was a calling to be in this position, not because I felt like I was the perfect person to do it, but because I was willing to put in the work towards progression.”
The first goal of the duo was to hire a new executive board that prioritized diversity and representation in response to the complaints from the Black Student Assembly and student activists, according to Savage. 
“It was super imperative to bring people on the team who were a byproduct of the movement we had just seen,” Moore said. “Diversity within our cabinet was one of the main things we tried to focus on.” 
Moore and Savage appointed a board representative of the racial and ethnic backgrounds of the student body as well as many who had no previous experience in USG. 
While they were successful in hiring a new board, several students from other branches also decided to leave USG, making it difficult to rebuild the organization. 
“We had folks from our communication team and from our funding department just drop out, and I understand why because USG had now been associated with some really ugly modes of thought,” Savage said. 
To tackle the mistrust head on, Savage conducted meetings with dozens of new and existing USG personnel to discuss the resignations and problems within the organization, including transparency and accountability. Savage said he felt it important to speak openly about the unusual transition of leadership.
“I wanted to be able to look every single person in USG in the face and say: ‘This is what we’re doing about it … and this is the direction we want to take the organization,’” Savage said. 
Since starting in August, Savage and Moore have met with university administrators to discuss demands from Black students, including defunding the USC Department of Public Safety and hiring more professors of color. He said that the administration remains committed to DPS and reforming the institution through the DPS Community Board sessions. 
“USC’s position is that defunding DPS is not the way to go,” Savage said. “We’ve talked to Chief Thomas about that, we’ve talked to the VP of Student Affairs about that, we’ve talked to President Folt.” 
Nevertheless, Savage and Moore are proud of what their team has accomplished. Moore noted the board meets weekly to discuss progress of ongoing efforts to better the USC community. 
“Everyone is really moving in tandem and towards the progressive way we want to move the org,” Moore said. “It’s not always visible what the executive members are doing but it’s great to see that a lot of them move in silence without a huge parade.”
NEW DEI EFFORTS
Inspired by student activism over the summer, Lucy Warren, a junior majoring in economics, decided to apply for the existing chief diversity officer position on the executive board. After earning the role, she has worked with cultural organizations to restore trust in USG.
“I sat down with every cultural organization at the beginning of last semester and asked them, what are the issues within USG? What is it that you want to see?” Warren said. “And I sat down and created a master list of projects that I knew we needed to start working on.” 
Warren also leads the USG Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion Council, which includes representatives from 12 cultural organizations who meet biweekly to discuss DEI issues on campus and related ongoing projects. Although the council existed loosely before this summer, it was officially written into the USG bylaws this summer. 
“The goal is to foster intersectional collaboration and ensure that USG and all of our projects are including every voice,” Warren said. 
The council worked together to develop a six-part DEI training series that all members of USG must participate in, covering microaggressions against different groups, intersectionality and performative activism. According to Warren, this is the first year USG has conducted substantive DEI training, with only a single day dedicated to implicit bias required in the past. 
Warren is also spearheading efforts to incorporate the DEI council, which is currently under the executive branch of USG, into the legislature. 
“I’m working on a restructuring plan to ensure that we create stipends and roles for [cultural] organizations to have representation directly in the legislative branch, so they can be working closer with our committees and Senate members,” Warren said. 
While Warren thinks USG has made headway to address racism in the organization, she said there’s still work to be done. 
“We had this big restructuring and then lost all of our cabinet, so last semester was just staying afloat,” Warren said. “Because of that, I don’t think we were able to fully take advantage of the movement and this culture shift.” 
Shreya Chaudhary, a junior majoring in business administration, currently serves as chief communications officer, and during her tenure, she has valued transparency above all else. 
“Overall this is a new era for USG,” Chaudhary said. “I’ve almost felt a shift. It’s about encouraging that shift to keep moving in that new direction. I think that’s the only way we’re going to bring USG into a direction that students can be proud of.”
In addition to her current duties, Chaudhary is also running to be USG president for the upcoming school year. Warren is running on an opposing ticket for vice president.
To ensure candidates run an inclusive campaign, the USG Elections Commission created the Diversity, Equity and Inclusion initiative pact, a form which candidates must sign to indicate their commitment to an equitable campaign. 
“We really want to stress how important it is to candidates that they’re running for the student body as representative of the student body,” said Anna Rodriguez, chair of the elections commission. “They need to be creating a more equitable, diverse and inclusive platform, as well as just trying to include that into their everyday lives.  
The Daily Trojan reported 4,700 total votes in the 2020 USG elections, which is less than 20% of the total student body. USG officials encourage students to vote so history doesn’t repeat itself. 
“I want to encourage as many students to vote in this election,” Moore said. “I think the events that happened over the summer are a result of what happens when not enough people vote and not enough people have a say in who is their leader. Vote for a candidate that aligns with what you want to see and the changes that you want to see happen and what you want USC to look like next year and beyond.”

With the season concluding soon, men’s basketball has caught fire at just the right time. The Trojans have won 13 of their last 15 games, earning themselves the No. 17 ranking in the country. 
They’ll look to continue their outstanding play against Arizona State Wednesday night at Galen Center.
In their earlier matchup against the Sun Devils, USC handled ASU on the road in a comfortable 73-64 victory. The Trojans were without sophomore guard Ethan Anderson, but freshman forward Evan Mobley made it up with 19 points, 13 rebounds and six blocks. 
ASU was also without their leading scorer, senior guard Remy Martin. The 6-foot guard from Chatsworth typically spearheads a Sun Devil guard trio that can pose a huge threat. Martin, who’s averaging nearly 20 points per game, freshman guard Josh Christopher and senior guard Alonzo Verge Jr. make up a dangerous and lightning-quick group unit. They combine for nearly 47 points per game and, with Martin set to play Wednesday, could give USC’s defense fits.
Head coach Andy Enfield highlighted the importance of containing the three players. 
“They’re so dangerous with their guard play and they’re so dynamic. They shoot a lot of 3s and they have the quickest guards in the league,” Enfield said in a virtual press conference Saturday. “They’re a really hard team to guard and we’ll just try to come up with a game plan to do our best.” 
In the two teams’ first matchup of the season, the trio of Verge Jr., Christopher and senior guard Holland Woods combined for 46 of the team’s 64 total points. 
This time around the Trojans will need to amp up defensive efforts to keep the Sun Devils in check. However, USC has earned national notoriety on that side of the ball, suffocating opponents to 37% shooting from the field — the fourth-best in the country. 
 The key, according to junior guard Drew Peterson, is forcing the guards toward the big men and always having help ready.
“They’re a quick team and they’re really tricky. And they got a lot of kind of [isolation] one on one guys that we got to keep in track,” Peterson said. “Being able to load up early, always having help because they like to play a lot of one on one. We got to be there [with the] next guy in line when they drive to the hoop.”
Because they are the tallest team in the nation, the Trojans have the ability to lean on their length to contain dangerous guards on the perimeter. 
Senior guard Isaiah White mentioned it’ll be important to use their length to disrupt shots and keep them from catching fire, which is something they are able to do quickly.
“Remy Martin and all those guys are very talented,” White said. “Trying to limit open shots and use our length on defense to bother everyone — I think that’ll be key just because they can get hot fast.”
USC should be able to feast on the other side of the ball.
Arizona State’s tallest player is 6-foot-10, sophomore forward John Olmsted who only played one minute in the first game. As a result, they rely heavily on freshman forward Marcus Bagley, sophomore forward Chris Osten and senior forward Kimani Lawrence to bang with the bigs down low. 
The three men not only struggled to contain Evan but also allowed his brother, sophomore forward Isaiah Mobley, to drop 13 points of his own. Peterson and senior guard Tahj Eaddy were able to reach double figures themselves too. 
“On the offensive end, we’re definitely going to try and dominate them on the inside,” Peterson said. “And obviously run through Evan [and] let him work and we’ll play off him and then hit open shots when we need to.”
With only six games remaining, each game is as important as the one before. USC is currently first in the Pac-12 and projected to be a four seed when March Madness comes around, according to ESPN.
The title race in the conference, however, is still alive and Peterson highlighted the importance of keeping the team focused. 
“We’re still shooting for this Pac 12 title [and we] got a one-game lead, and we can’t let anything up,” he said. “So no slip-ups can happen.”
USC looks to defend its Pac-12 lead on Wednesday against the Wildcats. Tip-off is at 5 p.m.

After witnessing my Kansas City Chiefs get completely outplayed last week, I wanted to shift gears from football and delve back into basketball for this week’s column. 
The biggest sporting event up next this year is the NCAA Basketball Tournament — more commonly known as March Madness. After its coronavirus-induced cancellation last season, audiences can finally watch some of the best collegiate programs in the country duke it out to win the 2021 title. Although, I don’t know if Duke will actually make it this year. 
This season has actually brought a lot of surprises. For starters, no traditional Blue Blood programs were ranked last week, marking the first time that’s happened since 1961 — when JFK was president and “West Side Story” was the most popular movie in theaters. Additionally, our very own Trojans are currently ranked at no. 17 and are sitting on top of the Pac-12. 
However, before we get to the chaotic 68-team tournament, we have to address the conference tournaments that teams will begin next month. Teams will be heading to different locations across the country to play for an automatic bid in the NCAA tournament (conference champions receive automatic bids). 
Even though these tournaments offer another welcome opportunity for fans to watch and cheer on their teams, the travel involved should cause some concerns. For example, USC will be heading to the T-Mobile Center at the Las Vegas Strip to play in the Pac-12 tournament. Likewise, many other teams will be heading to various cities such as Kansas City (Big 12), Greensboro (ACC) and Nashville (SEC). 
Having these conference tournament games can potentially increase the spread of coronavirus right before the national tournament. Therefore, it is crucial that the same level of precautions that will take place in Indianapolis occur at these matches as well because many of these teams will end up traveling to the big stage.
The NCAA does have a strong plan in place to limit travel and ensure safety as much as possible next month. They are making sure that teams that are at-large, meaning they are likely to qualify for the tournament irrespective of their performance at the national tournament, will stay at their conference tournament site until Selection Sunday. Along with those who automatically qualified, they will be in coordination with the NCAA to see how they will travel from their conference tournament site to Indiana for the national tournament. 
These strict protocols work well and can help limit any unnecessary travel. But in this case, the NCAA should enforce bubbles for teams that have around a 50/50 chance to make the tournament.
In terms of testing, teams, more specifically their designated 34-person traveling squad, need to have seven consecutive negative tests starting on Mar. 6 in order for everyone to be able to head to the tournament. In the case that someone tests positive, that individual should be monitored until they are done quarantining. 
This move is also somewhat risky because you can’t ensure that a person has not passed it on to other members of the team since, after all, they are all practicing and playing together. Another dynamic is that unlike football, where some coaches and players will rarely interact with one another, basketball has much smaller personnel and team sizes, so if one person on the team contracts coronavirus, it can spread faster throughout the squad. Additionally, since basketball is played in indoors and smaller arenas, transmission among teams can be higher. 
“The best indoor sport is an outdoor sport,” stated Dr. Cordelia Carter of NYU Lagone Health when asked about the transmission of coronavirus between outdoor and indoor sports in an article by the Washington Post. 
Overall, as we head into March, it will be key to look out for any cases that are popping up at conference tournaments. Conference tournaments are fun, and it’s great to see teams have a shot at their conference championships after being deprived of the opportunity last season, but that may not bode well for the execution of March Madness this year.

The audacity, I mutter to myself. Bewildered, I gape at the headline on Amazon.com — for the record, I wasn’t ordering anything from there but just browsing for book ISBNs and underwear to order elsewhere. At the beginning of February, in honor of Black History Month, Amazon took it upon themselves to update their webpage: “Celebrate Black History Month with Amazon” and “Buy BLACK Support Black-owned businesses,” emblazoned in white text against a stark black background. 
The irony of it all immediately struck me across the face and I took a moment before closing my jaw. I thought we had already gone over this — no anti-racism books from Amazon! Now, Amazon continues to grip the bandwagon of neoliberalism, and whether you see the problem with this or not, continue reading. 
The free-market economy will exploit workers while their CEO becomes billions of dollars richer in a pandemic that wrecks the economy and disproportionately impacts people of color yet still has the nerve to urge customers to support Black-owned businesses. Amazon thrives off the capitalist ideology that marginalizes Black people and monopolizes wealth while also painting a facade that they, too, support Black lives. In this ironic game of reductionism, Amazon epitomizes the paradox of neoliberalism in the United States’ free-market economy. Ultimately, we must not tolerate it so we do not subvert Black History Month, at least more than we already do. 
Coined back in 1938, neoliberalism defines competition as integral to humanity, glorifies efficiency and delineates inequality as a hierarchy — those with the most merit at the top, those who are lazy at the bottom. It completely undermines the sociological factors that disseminate the most wealth to those with the most education and inheritance. It values trickle-down economics or Reagan-era policies that cut taxes for the most wealthy so that the resultant extra wealth can flow down to lower income groups. 
Reaganomics continue to influence contemporary policies — hello, Donald Trump’s tax cuts to massive corporations and the most wealthy? Yet Reaganomics have repeatedly been proven as ineffective by economic research. According to a study by the Center for American Progress, trickle-down tax cuts actually widen the inequality gap and do not, in fact, catalyze job or economic growth. 
Yet, Jeff Bezos and Elon Musk remain the richest men in the world — not because of merit or the other lies popularized by neoliberalism but because of luck and the exploitation of lower economic groups for their benefit. So what business does Amazon have telling us to support Black-owned businesses and celebrate Black people when they are responsible for their continued oppression? 
The answer to this can be linked to reductionism at its finest. In a critique of race reductionism published in Dialectical Anthropology, author Adolph Reed Jr. discusses race reductionism in light of antiracism discourse — how it totalizes white supremacy and racial discrimination without recognizing the systems responsible for its perpetuity. It reduces Black politics to a “unitary struggle against white supremacy” in the myopic lens of neoliberalism. Race reductionism posits “that the problem of inequality is not its magnitude or intensity … but whether or not it is distributed in a racially equitable way.” 
In other words, neoliberalism does not have a problem with wealth inequality, but it has a problem that racial groups are unevenly distributed through the wealth pyramid. Simply, race reductionism subverts how capitalist policies magnify the racial wealth gap. It’s why being “fiscally conservative” and “socially liberal” makes zero sense — race reductionism closes off leftist conversations about policy and insists that Bezos and the top 1% deserve to monopolize capital while the working-class struggles to support themselves when working 40 hours per week. 
How else does race reductionism plague society? It was quite amusing to witness the NFL project Black Lives Matter ads. This is the same organization that idolizes Tom Brady, a known Trump supporter who owns a Make America Great Again hat, and demonizes Colin Kaepernick, who years ago took a knee and lost his contract for it. They plastered “End Racism” across the field of the Kansas City Chiefs (I don’t think I need to explain that one). These facades try to hide the same systemic harm Amazon wreaks, masquerading as a commitment to racial equality in a neoliberal system. 
In another prime example, we lobbied so rigorously to replace a fascist with President Joe Biden, disputedly a neoliberal. Although Biden wants to funnel more funding into police departments, he at least supports raising the minimum wage, right? Well, the federal minimum wage will be $15 by 2025 in his proposal, which does not account for inflation, and our capitalist-corrupted society still remains torn about actually supplying people with a living wage. 
Amidst it all, the American education system fails immensely when it comes to Black History. People in Utah opted their children out of Black history curricula. Republican state lawmakers are threatening to cut funding to schools that teach the 1619 Project, published by The New York Times to educate about the centrality of slavery in American history. Schools, and society holistically, ignore Martin Luther King Jr.’s scrutiny of capitalism and instead capitalize on “peaceful protesting,” and it shows in the people these systems produce. 
So no, I will not be celebrating Black History Month with Amazon. In the meantime, I will continue filling in the gaps the American education system created and society perpetuated.

In light of Donald Trump’s impeachment trial, let’s reminisce over USC’s ghost of impeachment past — or more specifically, the impeachment that never was. For those who’ve already forgotten: that of the former USG President Truman Fritz. 
Accusations had arisen on the @black_at_usc Instagram page, triggering a formal complaint launched by student activist Abeer Tijani and backed by thousands of student signatures via petition. On the day of his impeachment hearing, Fritz resigned amid numerous allegations of racist conduct. His vice president, Rose Ritch, found by a portion of the student body to be complicit in her colleague’s misconduct, followed him into disgrace just a month later. 
His impeachment was based on violation of USG ethics bylaws, and Tijani’s complaint was submitted following multiple attempts at communication with both Fritz and Ritch. Both resignations were announced via emails to the USC body, where both candidates shied away from any semblance of accountability, hiding behind shields of white guilt. 
Speaker of the Senate Gabe Savage and Sen. Trinity Moore filled the voided seats of USG president and vice president, respectively. And just like that, Fritz was able to avoid the publicity of the impeachment trial — allowed to slink away and his misdeeds to be sweetened by the forgiving honeyed flavor of time and memory.
Lucky for both him and his former VP, at USC there is no punishment for racism. If you think that’s a bold statement, recall the events of the past school year: Black and brown Greek organizations segregated during the 2019 Homecoming Tailgate, the racist meme targeting Latinx residents after the Fluor Tower flooding, the inflammatory messages scrawled on students doors in Nemirovsky and Bohnett Residential College and the administrative resistance against the student-led push for VKC’s name change.
This is not about Fritz, Ritch or even President Carol Folt. The past is dead, the future yet to be conceived. This is about the now. Voting is open today through Feb. 19. To my fellow students: Have you read the candidates’ statements? What are their platforms? Do you know who’s running? 
The last few years have seen a downward trend in voter participation. To combat voter apathy in the 2020 election, USG tried to incentivize students to vote with promises of In-N-Out. While this was an admirable attempt to engage voters, it is ultimately the responsibility of the students to perform their civic duty. 
Unlike the greater country, where voter suppression is a real threat, low voting numbers cannot be linked to systemic voter suppression. Last year, only 23% of the student body voted — look how that turned out. Such a low number, nowhere near majority representation, is almost laughable. Except that students are suffering from it.
USG is structured to mimic the U.S. national government: complete with an executive, legislative and judicial branch. However — unlike the real world — candidates don’t share their political standing — instead masking their ideologies behind keyphrases to get elected. Ultimately, they’re playing house; dressing up as politicians without engaging in actual politics. Let’s take this campaign season as a case study. 
During the USG Presidential Debate — held over Zoom on Feb. 4 — presidential candidate Alexandra Gill introduced herself as an outsider to USG, calling for an end to “career politicians.” This should sound familiar; it was one of Trump’s favorite phrases during his presidential campaign. Now, maybe it’s being unfair likening this candidate to the disgraced former U.S. president. However, I call it like I see it, and I see a reactionary Republican running for student president in response to Trump’s fall from power. 
Last year, the Fritz and Ritch campaign lied to the USC student body. They campaigned on honeyed promises of inclusion and racial awareness; yet in their personal lives, they actively perpetuated the discrimination they claimed to denounce. They might have escaped impeachment, but they must not escape our memory. As members of one of the most prestigious universities in this country, it is within the realm of students’ ability to actively and thoughtfully engage in the sphere of power which dictates the shape of our college experience.
USC is a a primarily white institution. Its structures and history benefit the white and privileged students who make its majority. If no one votes for change, it will not magically occur. Yes, college is a stepping stone, and we’re first and foremost here to get an education, but it’s a stepping stone you’re paying an arm and a leg for. So take advantage of it.
