I’m not blonde, but, growing up, I could relate a lot to the film “Legally Blonde.” Mostly, I saw myself in the struggles of the protagonist Elle Woods (Reese Witherspoon), who faces a culture shock when she moves to Massachusetts from sunny Los Angeles to attend Harvard Law School. It wasn’t so much about the decision to follow her ex-boyfriend to law school, but Elle’s response to her boyfriend’s rejection of their relationship. She wanted to prove that she was worthy enough of her boyfriend, and later she wanted to prove that she was worthy enough for herself.
As the audience, we’re shown in the beginning that Elle Woods represents the quintessential L.A. sorority girl: blonde, pretty, wealthy and into fashion and beauty. However, because she conforms to this stereotype on the outside, people tend to only value her looks rather than her intelligence. It’s what ultimately makes Elle’s boyfriend, Warner Huntington III (Matthew Davis), break up with her, implying that she’s not right for someone who’s going to be a serious lawyer.
Now, I don’t quite relate to the whole being attractive portion or the acceptance to Harvard Law School part, but I empathize with Elle. Her dreams are often not viewed as worthy by other people around her. Her parents don’t agree with her decision to go to law school, telling her that she’s not cut out for it and that she is more suited for L.A. culture. Her friends are as supportive as they can be, but they also don’t understand why Elle wants to go to law school. Warner even tells her that she’s not smart enough for Harvard. 
All these pressures build upon Elle, but she always rises above them. Sure, it’s an idealistic fictional narrative. Yet, as a young child who always felt I had to prove myself to others, I saw Elle as one of my role models. I aspired to have her attitude toward the obstacles in her life. Elle’s realization that she’ll never be enough for Warner leads to one of the most iconic moments of the film. 
“I’ll show you how valuable Elle Woods can be,” she huffs at one point. It’s one of the most motivational montage sequences where Elle is working hard and becoming successful.  Everyone around Elle thought her dream of attending law school was an illusion, but she made it a reality. True to legal fashion (in the most literal sense), she proved them wrong. 
In my opinion, however, the best part of the film is when Elle wins her court case with her knowledge of hair perms, thanks to her distinctly L.A. lifestyle that she was constantly looked down upon for. Despite everyone dismissing her because of her background, Elle showed that being from L.A. was actually an asset for her study of law. 
Where Elle initially failed trying to conform to the East Coast vibe, her recognition of her own strengths led her to success. Ultimately, Elle’s experiences and unique perspective make her a great lawyer. She inserts her own L.A. identity into the East Coast. In the end, Elle discovers that it’s not about choosing one or the other, but reconciling the two. 
In my law, history and culture major, I sometimes find myself facing the same struggles and insecurities that Elle faced during her first year at Harvard. In classes, I wonder if someone who knows more about “Legally Blonde” than legal philosophies should be in the major at all. In the movie, Elle’s L.A. knowledge of popular culture and self care is viewed as superficial. Similarly, I wonder if my own inclination towards entertainment or a culture focused on illusions, isn’t productive or “serious” enough for a career of reality. 
Then I end up having to overrule my own thoughts. I think about Elle Woods, who taught me that you don’t have to conform to what other people want you to be. Being yourself isn’t the most original message out there, but I believe that Elle would agree: There’s no one-size-fits-all to who you want to be. 
There’s another lesson in the film about not being afraid to embrace your differences, but my insight from “Legally Blonde” is that there’s a thin line between illusions and reality. Just like how they’re depicted in the film, the two ideas aren’t mutually exclusive. Much like sustaining an objection, it’s necessary to maintain both reality and illusions. They’re important evidence not for a case, but for who you are — and who you can be.

Football may have taken a week’s break, but here at the Top 10, we never rest. Men’s water polo won a primetime matchup, women’s soccer refused to lose and a couple of former Trojans had strong starts in the NBA’s return. Let’s get down to business.
Underrated USC basketball
The preseason AP Top 25 College Basketball poll landed last week with no USC men’s basketball in the rankings. The Trojans had the 3rd-most votes among unranked teams, putting them in a more favorable position than you might think. Teams that were unranked before the season have gone on to win the national championship six times, as many times as preseason No. 9-25 have ever won combined. 
Shillelagh Hunting
USC and Notre Dame added another chapter to their storied football rivalry last Saturday. Notre Dame came away with the Shillelagh after a 31-16 victory over the Trojans, but what exactly is a Shillelagh? The Jeweled Shillelagh is an Irish club made of blackthorn or oak saplings imported from Ireland. First awarded in the 1952, the Shillelagh commemorated the inaugural game of the rivalry, played in 1926, and was donated by the Notre Dame Alumni Club of Los Angeles. 
Jaxson Dart’s recovery
 Freshman quarterback Jaxson Dart returned to almost full practice participation last week, graduating to an injury status of “out” to “day-to-day.” While he wasn’t able to return to action against Notre Dame, Dart will be back sooner rather than later. Interim head coach Donte Williams said Dart was “cleared to an extent,” but Williams decided to keep him on the bench until he’s 100%.
Water polo bounces back
Men’s water polo came back from a defeat at UC Berkeley to record two straight wins against ranked opposition. The Trojans blew out No. 12 UC Irvine on the road 17-8 before heading to Long Beach State for a top-5 battle. Five goals in the 2nd quarter gave USC a lead it wouldn’t relinquish. Carson Kranz and Wyatt Barker chipped in with their second and third hat tricks of the season, respectively. Then, the Trojans took down No. 4 Stanford on the road Saturday to cap off a great week.
Anna Smith, resident brick wall
Another week without losing for the women’s soccer team. Goalkeeper Anna Smith left it all on the field to keep the Trojans’ unbeaten streak going with 11 saves, matching her career-high as the game went to overtime. Head Coach Keidane McAlpine had this to say after the 0-0 slugfest against Washington State Thursday: “This is the kind of game that we need to get better.”
NBA Trojans settle in
The Bulls and Cavaliers tipped off their seasons with a pair of Trojans in tow. Shooting guard DeMar DeRozan clocked in with 17 points, seven rebounds and a pair of assists in his first showing since being traded to the Windy City. Elsewhere in the Eastern conference, center Evan Mobley had a debut to remember. With 17 points, nine rebounds, six assists, one steal and one block, he hit marks no rookie (other than Phoenix Suns center Deandre Ayton) has ever hit in their opening contest.
Going for it
Senior running back Keaontay Ingram ran for a first down against Notre Dame on 4th-and-2 just before the end of half last Saturday, continuing a trend of 4th down excellence. USC has gone 4-6 on 4th down conversions this year. 
Women’s rowing sets off
The USC women’s rowing team traveled to Boston for its first regatta of the season. Competing in the women’s club eights event at the Head of the Charles Regatta, the Trojan rowers didn’t mess around. They took first place out of 31 college teams, an impressive start to a promising season. 
Keaontay Ingram’s big day
Ingram was a bright spot in an otherwise disappointing loss to Notre Dame. He ran for 138 yards, a season-high and his third touchdown of the year, helping kickstart the USC offense when it looked to be stuck in a ditch. His physical running set the tone for a tougher second-half showing on both sides of the ball. 
Intramural Drama III: The pain of defeat
Often, we journalists are directed to be impartial, to emotionally distance ourselves from the subject of our coverage. In this aspect, I have perhaps failed. 
For six weeks, I have covered this intramural soccer team, growing to appreciate its dedication and grit. In the end, all good things must come to an end. The USC intramural team, “Players without a team,”  was defeated in a 1-0 loss in the round of 16 two weeks ago, finishing an eventful period of competition in disappointment. Although they’re called “Players without a team,” by the end of their season, they had found a team to be proud of.

Like a magazine, Wes Anderson’s latest film “The French Dispatch” reads as a thoughtful, poetic display of the written word. A story about journalists first and foremost, the film showcases stories in and around France through the lens of the foreign correspondents writing them. By translating written stories to a cinematic format, “The French Dispatch” demonstrates an effortless mastery of visual storytelling.
The film  situates itself in Ennui-sur-Blasé, a fictional French town where the staff of “The French Dispatch” — the French bureau of a Kansas-based newspaper — are getting ready to publish its final issue after the death of its editor Arthur Howitzer Jr. (Bill Murray). The journalists’ stories for the magazine serve as the subjects of the film. 
Roughly three largely disparate stories make up the entirety of “The French Dispatch,” and they correspond to different sections of the magazine: arts, politics and food. The first story is a romance between an incarcerated artist named Moses Rosenthaler (Benicio Del Toro) and his prison guard Simone (Léa Seydoux). Another has a more political angle, featuring journalist Lucinda Krementz (Frances McDormand) developing a relationship with Zeffirelli, the young chess prodigy and activist she’s profiling (Timothée Chalamet). The third story is about a food writer, Roebuck Wright (Jeffrey Wright) who gets wrapped up in a kidnapping in the process of interviewing a chef (Stephen Park). 
True to the work of its journalistic subject matter, “The French Dispatch” unravels the different layers of a story with striking precision. The film imitates the artistic form of magazine storytelling through the incorporation of multimedia elements. One chase sequence in the third story, for example, is depicted entirely through an animated cartoon. Drawing on voiceover narration, drawings and aesthetic cinematography, “The French Dispatch” feels very much like an accompanying video feature to a print story. In many ways, it is. 
Aesthetically, Anderson’s style has much to marvel at: The bright colors in the background are visually appealing and at the forefront of the film. Settings are whimsical and dynamic enough that they allow for a meaningful degree of escapism. Sometimes those colors are swapped out in favor of black-and-white, but those decisions add their own evocative flair. 
The characters’ dialogue, too, is biting and humorous. It’s undeniably fun just how quickly Zeffirelli and fellow rebel Juliette (Lyna Khoudri) are able to bounce off one another in their conversations about the student revolution. English and French are both used in these debates, indicating a cross-cultural perspective to Anderson’s cinematic rendering.
In all the other stories, one just can’t help but eagerly anticipate the responses to witty remarks. Language is the film’s obvious strength. There’s a clear rhythm to the banter that “The French Dispatch” executes particularly well. 
Of course, the sheer amount of stories can also feel disorienting. For those who aren’t as familiar with the fast-paced nature of an Anderson film, the subplots can be distracting — and bordering on convoluted. Brevity is at the core of journalism, and sometimes that concision feels lacking in the film. The kidnapping plot in particular is haphazard enough that it no longer feels purposeful. It’s easy to get lost in such swerves, as if the original article — or script in this case — didn’t undergo enough editing. 
Furthermore, a few minor characters are briefly dismissed without explicit significance to the story’s plot. With these incoherencies, it’s difficult to understand why these characters were ever included in the first place.
In many ways, that idea does tell us a lot about journalism. Narrative, much like “The French Dispatch,” can be imperfect, even messy. At its core, journalism is about the story. Stories aren’t linear. When the film jumps from one character to another, it also references the narrative medium itself. In the second story, there’s a reflexive element to Lucinda’s presence documenting Zeffirelli, as the concept of journalistic neutrality is hotly debated. Ethical questions are posed about what the role of the journalist is. Both editing and writing are questioned in relation to how these practices shape a story. 
Storytelling is a gift, and “The French Dispatch” tells stories within stories. Sure, those stories sometimes have a few places where sentences could be tighter, structures could be adjusted and whole paragraphs could be cut out. Even with those flaws, they’re gifts, nonetheless, neatly wrapped up in Anderson’s stylistic filmmaking and presented to the audience as a reminder of why arts and culture are so incredibly important. 
As a representation of arts and culture at their best, it’s no question that “The French Dispatch” is a story in and of itself. In fact, it’s a story about storytellers, and that might just be the most powerful form of storytelling there is.

Content Warning: The following article contains references to sexual assault, drugging and violence.
The Daily Trojan Editorial Board unequivocally believes, uplifts and stands with sexual assault survivors and anyone who has encountered harm under patriarchal systems of oppression. 
On Wednesday, the Department of Public Safety announced in a communitywide memo that the Sigma Nu fraternity house had been placed on an interim suspension following drugging and sexual assault reports. The memo came with “safety tips” that “may help reduce the possibility of experiencing a crime,” such as keeping track of drinks and traveling in small groups, which only further bolsters a false method of deterrence that shifts responsibility away from perpetrators. 
To “help reduce the possibility” of sexual violence, the answer is, undoubtedly, straightforward: Don’t rape.
But, as evidenced by the continuation of reports that DPS received since Oct. 20 regarding more allegations of drugging and sexual assault at other fraternity houses on the Row, and confirmation from the Los Angeles Police Department that former Sigma Nu president Ryan Schiffilea is a “main suspect” in the Sigma Nu sexual assault reports, it is clear that members of Interfraternity Council-affiliated Greek life chapters cannot grasp this clear rule. 
Following these reports, students have protested outside the Sigma Nu house since last Thursday, leaving signs taped on walls with messages such as “Abolish Greek Life,” “Male chauvinists go to hell” and “Was inflicting a lifetime of trauma worth it for you?”
While the last question was addressed to Sigma Nu — the Daily Trojan Editorial Board would like to extend it to the University administration as well. After a massive emergence of reports and student demands, the University must acknowledge the situation with a firm stance — a definitive position — instead of shallow community letters that say nothing and mean nothing without action. 
Unfortunately, the manner in which USC responded to the string of drugging and sexual assaults is nothing new — USC administrators knew of former gynecologist George Tyndall sexually abusing patients yet they did not fire him. Whenever a critical issue arises, the University adopts a half-hearted, performative and optical approach, which feigns concern for social issues and curbs media attention. 
Such performativity was the case with Black Lives Matter protests last year. Following the murders of George Floyd, Breonna Taylor and Ahmaud Arbery, President Carol Folt released a statement declaring,“This moment is our call to action,” yet merely added fancy titles onto an already burgeoning University and changed the name of a building. Folt did not even attend the Black Lives Matter march on USC’s own campus. 
Let us not forget USC failed to even acknowledge the demands of USC Students for Justice in Palestine, who raised legitimate concerns about the anti-Arab and anti-Palestinian rhetoric from Undergraduate Student Government leaders, former senators Isabel Washington and Nathaniel Manor. The University has a track record of picking and choosing which causes to pledge support; but, even when it promises support, USC rarely follows through.
Now, USC is approaching the Sigma Nu assaults in the same way it approached Black Lives Matter and Palestinian students’ concerns last year. Just like its handling of the latter events, the University is chalking up statements promising it will do better, yet discreetly praying that its complicity in IFC’s history of sexual violence goes unnoticed. 
For example, while DPS sent out another memo Saturday that clarified, “No action or inaction by a sexual assault survivor makes that person responsible for another person’s abusive or criminal conduct,” USC’s lackluster response and Folt’s message to the University speaks volumes to its history of inaction toward situations that compromise its students’ safety.
Time and time again, the University shows that it is, at most, interested in surface-level changes but not institutional shakedowns. 
The sexual assault cases at Sigma Nu are not random occurrences but instead the amalgamation of fraternities’ unbalanced systems of power. Indeed, DPS receives reports about sexual assault in other fraternities, as evidenced in Saturday’s memo. 
Fraternities are dangerous institutions that reinforce harmful behavior toward women, nonbinary individuals and people of color. These institutions are places where racism, sexism, homophobia and classism flourish. For example, the National Panhellenic Council banned alcohol in 1975, yet fraternities can still distribute it. This sexist rule makes sororities rely on fraternities for events and alcohol, which gives fraternities control over how women consume alcohol. 
Greek life has been a part of USC since 1889 — decades before the school would see its first Black graduate. Purposefully founded to serve white, heterosexual, cisgender men, fraternities have not changed much over the years. Despite scholarship and fundraising opportunities, membership barriers, such as high costs, still ensure that low-income students, who are predominantly Black and Indigenous people and people of color, cannot join. 
The white demographic buildup enables racist behavior to go unchecked, and, with most members being cisgender men, sexism is the norm. Greek life manifests not only patriarchy but also a cesspool of bigotry, where every member must live up to being a white, cisgender man. This standard creates a culture of men who are complicit in sexual assault and remain silent when their “brothers” wreak harm against women.
Despite IFC’s corrosive patriarchal culture, USC has a history of letting fraternities get away with violations. While the school strictly enforces coronavirus regulations for on-campus dorms, these fraternities have practically no rules — throughout the pandemic, they held parties with no social distancing and faced no disciplinary action from the University. While USC explicitly prohibits hazing, fraternities still engage in it. 
When it comes to actually enforcing meaningful regulations, especially against IFC fraternities, the University falls short. This inaction may be attributed to the monetary and social benefits fraternities provide. Fraternity members are often so loyal to the school that their alumni donate generous amounts to USC. In fact, some Board of Trustees members, such as Chairman Rick Caruso, were members of fraternities when they attended USC, which could also contribute to USC’s lack of action toward fraternities.
Among the lack of accountability and complacency, students are ultimately tired of a University that protects rapists instead of its students. Folt and USC administration: We see you, but we hear your silence. While Sigma Nu’s actions horrify our community, this incident is only one of the countless times IFC has endangered USC students and the surrounding South Central community. Your failure to enact tangible change continues to make you complicit in the same violence and misogyny that IFC perpetuates. 
As the Daily Trojan Editorial Board, we demand the University address its role in allowing the events at Sigma Nu to occur. As evidenced by past and emerging incidents of sexual assault at IFC fraternities, Sigma Nu is only one part of an entire institution that perpetrates sexual violence. To prevent such horrific instances in the future, the University must move to dismantle the entire IFC system that upholds this misogynistic framework. 
However, we acknowledge the University’s track record of prioritizing profits over students’ well-being and making optical promises to save face. Beyond asking students to keep their drinks with them at all times, the University should actually commit to a systemic change, which would actually prioritize students’ safety over revenue and appeasing donors. 
At the bare minimum, Sigma Nu must permanently lose University recognition. USC’s current lackluster stipulations for fraternity members, such as compliance with online consent modules and training videos, only reinforce the idea that sexual assault and drugging are forgivable acts. A line must be drawn somewhere. Let the drawing finally, for once, commence here.
The University administration should not be alone in taking accountability. The relationship between students and Greek life is complex and not exclusive to those who are not sorority or fraternity members. Because USC’s Greek life culture extends to every student, everyone is complicit in the continuation of this institution on our campus. 
To those in Greek life: Although your organizations often promote community, service and other values important to USC, do these values outweigh explicit contempt with rape culture and misogyny? Does having a community also include staying quiet when fellow Greek members drug and sexually assault people? Does service include giving money to an institution that protects rapists? Is this a reputation you want to uphold?
To those not directly in Greek life: Does a party matter more than protecting a person’s body? Even if you don’t actively seek social activities in Greek life, its institution occupies the campus and community’s space. Its existence here affects the reputation of you and USC. People see what is happening, and they see you. They see whether you act or stay quiet. 
To address the problems that go beyond Sigma Nu, we must reflect on our own relationships with Greek life and question whether these organizations’ social benefits outweigh the harm they cause. 
Ultimately, students must all stand behind this call for accountability. We must demand justice for the individuals who were harmed, both the reported ones and those who have yet to step forward. 
Students must come together and pressure the University and authorities to charge the responsible parties and permanently end this culture of rape and privilege. Again, this is not possible by just suspending Sigma Nu because Greek life, as an institution, has deeply ingrained problems. 
Community, service and honor can be possible outside of an institutionalized Greek life. As it stands, these values do not exist in a Greek system of injustice.
