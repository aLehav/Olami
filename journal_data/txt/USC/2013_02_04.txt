Though the Los Angeles City Council approved construction on the The Village at USC project in December, the timeline for development is not set and initial planning stages for the first phase, which precedes actual architectural design, could take anywhere from 12 to 24 months.
The first phase of construction will just affect the lot of the University Village. Cardinal Gardens and Century apartments will not be impacted immediately.
The university must also build a new fire station before any construction begins, according to USC Real Estate and Asset Management. This might happen in the next year or two.
The large size of the project is to blame for the amount of time it will take for construction to begin. The city permits USC to build on up to two million square feet — 10 times the size of the Ronald Tutor Campus Center. For reference, the new Engemann Health Center took 18 months to construct and about six months to plan. It is 101,000 square feet.
Renderings shown on the village.usc.edu website and printed in the Daily Trojan last year are not architecturally accurate — they were used to show the city what The Village will generally look like. An architect has yet to be assigned the project.
The Village will likely use the space more efficiently to accommodate for the expected addition of 5,000 beds, and the city’s permit to build requires that the university to build space for at least 3,000 new beds before demolishing existing housing.
Though Cardinal Gardens and Century apartments will likely not be demolished for a few years, the city’s permits also grant USC permission to add 2,400 beds. At an on-campus forum in April 2012, Vice President for Real Estate and Asset Management Kristina Raspe said one of the primary purposes of The Village is to grant more housing to students.
“There is not enough housing that is appropriate quality or appropriately priced for our students,” Raspe said. “For us to continue to compete for the best and brightest students, the quality of student housing will be a part of this. Adding new beds will have an impact on rent in the area and will significantly decrease rent.”
The plan approved by the city incentivizes USC to provide more housing. USC must give the city of Los Angeles $20 million toward affordable housing development, giving $10 million when construction begins, $5 million 10 years later and another $5 million five years after that. But, if the university provides housing to 70 percent of its undergraduate population 20 years after The Village opens, the final $5 million installment is waived.
The plan approved by the city council also requires that USC apply for new building permits if construction is not completed by 2030.
USC bought the University Village in 1999, taking over leases of already-established businesses and using empty space to house several USC offices, including a physical therapy clinic and a community computer center. Public meetings for the purpose of developing the renovation plan began in 2008.
When the city council approved the project in December, Senior Vice President of University Relations Thomas Sayles emphasized the long process of planning led to the city council’s unanimous approval.
“It’s a win-win-win. It’s a win for the university, it’s a win for the community and it’s a win for the city of Los Angeles,” Sayles told the Daily Trojan. “There was virtually no opposition to this today, and the collaboration process has made it possible for us to embark on this truly transformative project.”

The Health Sciences Campus is undergoing a $35 million beautification project that aims to create a more cohesive appearance between the University Park Campus and HSC.
The project has been divided into three phases. The first and current phase focuses on streetscape beautification, largely moving in an east-to-west direction across campus. These phases will reduce disruption within the campus to manageable sizes.
Voluntary public funds will be used to support streetscape improvements including new sidewalks and infrastructure.
“The main goal is to create a better environment and to improve the pedestrian experience on the campus and surrounding streets for faculty, staff, students, visitors to the campus and the community,” said Laurie Stone, USC executive director of land use and planning.
Larger impacts to the overall aesthetics of the campus will include two prominent campus markers on Soto Street and smaller ones on less-populated campus entrances.
Construction began in August, when infrastructure was readjusted on Alcazar and Soto streets. Power lines, water and gas lines were moved underground in order to create a seamless path for pedestrians.
Unlike the University Park Campus, HSC does not have a consistent architectural style. To stylistically connect the two campuses, there are plans for more outdoor park-like areas to be built. Widened sidewalks, decorative brick motifs and 700 trees will be added as well.
Project coordinators hope this beautification process will create uniformity within.
“The campus also currently lacks an identity; the brick banding and use of streetscape fixtures similar to the University Park Campus will help enhance the USC identity at the Health Sciences Campus,” Stone said.
Though construction is in its early phases, students are eager to see the evolution of the campus.
“I am looking forward to seeing that [final product],” said Ying Long, a graduate student studying in the pharmacy doctorate program. “We [students] would like to see the beauty of the campus. If it’s going to become more friendly, it makes the experience better.”
The City of Los Angeles owns the property near Soto Street, which is designated as a public street.
Some students are optimistic about the change the construction will bring to the campus.
“I think it will enhance the area, especially in this campus,” said Toshifumi Araki, a student majoring in occupational therapy at HSC.
Potential improvements also include relocating the handball court and building an outdoors exercise circuit route.
The streetscape phase of the HSC beautification process will begin in fall 2013, according to Stone, depending on city approvals. The university expects the project to be completed in 2015.

A Dept. of Public Safety officer and his fiancee were found late Sunday dead from gunshots in a parked car in Irvine, Calif.
In memoriam · Dept. of Public Safety Officer Keith Lawrence and his fiancee were found dead in their car Sunday evening in Irvine. – Courtesy of the Dept. of Public Safety
The victims, who were found in the vehicle at about 9:10 p.m., were identified as Keith Lawrence, 27, and Monica Quan, 28. Gunshots were not reported that night, and the bodies were only found after a passerby noticed Lawrence slumped over the steering wheel, according to police. Law enforcement officials are continuing to investigate the crime as a double homicide, not a murder-suicide.
Lawrence joined DPS in August 2012 and at the time of his death was assigned to patrol operations, according to DPS Capt. David Carlisle. Quan was an assistant basketball coach for the Cal State Fullerton women’s team. Previously, the two had attended Concordia University in Irvine, where they both excelled in college basketball. After college, Lawrence graduated from the Ventura County Sheriff’s Academy and was an armed officer.
DPS Chief John Thomas released a statement Monday regarding the shooting.
“It is with great sadness and a very heavy heart that I announce the untimely death of a member of the DPS Family, PSO I Keith Lawrence,” he wrote.
Though Lawrence was only with DPS for a short period, Thomas commended his efforts to help protect the USC community.
“During his brief tenure of service here at USC, Officer Lawrence proved to be an honorable, compassionate and professional member of our department and the Trojan Family,” Thomas wrote. “We are a better department and the USC Campus Community is a safer place as a result of his service.”
Thomas also called on the department and others to remember Lawrence when acting as public safety officers and officials, also asking to keep “Keith and his fiancee’s families in your thoughts and prayers as they grieve and begin the healing process.”
“Please continue to espouse those same values of honor, commitment to duty, professionalism and compassion as we continue to add to his legacy and those that we all share as members of the law enforcement public safety community,” Thomas wrote.
Jealously and envy.
All the DPS officer I’ve encountered at USC have been wonderfully professional and pleasant. My sincere condolences to the family and friends of Officer Lawrence and Ms. Quan, to USC DPS, and the USC community.

Undergraduate Student Government presidential and vice presidential candidates referred to their platforms and personal experiences Monday night to address how their administrations would handle and support diversity.
Diversity discussion · Undergraduate Student Government held its second annual presidential diversity forum on Monday evening. – Joseph Chen | Daily Trojan
The assemblies of USC Program Board organized the USG Candidate Diversity Forum to urge candidates to address important diversity issues, such as transgender housing and racial profiling on campus.
The forum was moderated by Vincent Vigil, director of the LGBT Resource Center.
After briefly outlining their political platforms, the candidates answered questions from various student assemblies, such as the Queer and Ally Student Assembly and the Women’s Student Assembly.
The candidates emphasized increased communication from student organizations to USG officials as an essential action going forward.
When addressing a question posed by the Women’s Student Assembly about how the candidates plan to support women’s issues, presidential candidate and current USG Director of University Affairs Christian Kurth said that conversation is crucial to change.
“Opening up lines of communication is the biggest thing for me,” Kurth said. “We don’t understand what you guys go through and what you guys need. And I think that if you can be honest with us, we can be honest with you, and we can work together to help you guys in whatever you need.”
Candidates also drew on their own backgrounds and personal experiences to convey that they can relate to students’ problems.
Vice presidential candidate Ryan Park, currently a Greek senator, said that his racial background has taught him how to accept himself and how to help other students embrace their ethnicities.
“I’ve learned what it means to let go of things you can’t change, to be proud of them, to move forward and to understand this is who you are,” Park said. “I want to make sure that students feel that same pride, regardless of what they look like. I want students to understand that being who you are is the most important thing about you.”
Presidential candidate Matt Arkfeld, current USG Senate speaker pro tempore, reached out to LGBT students on campus by saying that he can personally identify with them, promising to take a strong stance against gender discrimination and to push for gender-neutral housing.
“We are huge supporters of LGBT, a group that I myself identify with,” Arkfeld said. “I plan on taking a strong stance against [injustice] and pushing transgender rights into the future. Their needs haven’t been met — what’s going on right now with gender-inclusive housing and the rainbow floors is taking a problem and not really solving it … the fact is, we need to push for true gender-neutral housing to exist.”
The forum uncovered a difference between the candidates’ ideologies when they were asked what they would do to improve the college experiences of international students. While Arkfeld thought that it was most important for international students to learn how to adapt to the culture of USC, Kurth was most concerned with helping students from abroad network after college.
“We want to bring out employers who can really understand the issues international students face,” Kurth said. “If we can add a career fair for international students, after these students leave USC, it could help them kickstart their lives after college in America.”
Vice presidential candidate Alex Cascante, currently a Greek senator, believed that none of these changes could be made without the student body’s voice.
“In order to do anything else, the first thing we must identify is a problem,” Cascante said. “If there’s no problem, there’s nothing to fix. It’s important to open communication channels, to talk to students to find out if there was an issue and to ask, ‘how can we make this process better?’”
The new campus security measures, the disparity between lower-class and wealthier students and racial profiling on campus were also discussed.
The Asian Pacific American Student Assembly, the Black Student Assembly, the International Student Assembly, the Latina/o Student Assembly, Women’s Student Assembly and the Queer and Ally Student Assembly held the forum.
Kaya Masler, executive director of the USC Women’s Student Assembly, said that the forum was a beneficial way for the candidates to hear different opinions and learn from them.
“I feel like all of the candidates got a chance to learn, and it was a growing opportunity for everybody in the room,” Masler said. “There was a little bit of contention, but I think out of contention is an opportunity for us all to come together.”

They say that college football is a year-round experience and never is this more evident than on national signing day, a culmination of months and months of speculation and hype regarding tomorrow’s gridiron stars. For some, the day represents one of hope for programs looking to put recent struggles behind them. For others, the ritual has become a tiresome ordeal that places too much importance on unproven teenage players.
Many USC fans might fall into the latter group.
For the past decade or so, USC has routinely finished among the top schools in the nation at recruiting, luring in many so-called blue chip prospects and racking up five-star recruits as regularly as clockwork. In the early part of the 2000s, these high school standouts turned into college stars, with athletes such as Mike Williams, Darnell Bing and Rey Maualuga living up to expectations.
But for every success story comes a disaster story, and recently, there have been plenty of sure-thing prospects that haven’t panned out. Former players such as Kyle Prater, Chris Galippo and D.J. Shoemate either transferred from USC or graduated without making an impact. And given this last season’s disastrous finish, it might be time to evaluate whether or not the team’s recent recruiting pedigree is paying off on the field.
Under Lane Kiffin, USC’s recruiting classes have ranked no lower than 13th nationally, according to ESPN, and this year’s class is expected to rank within the top 10 once again. Next season, Kiffin will have a roster nearly filled with players that he himself recruited, not merely inherited from former USC coach Pete Carroll. But looking at how each of Kiffin’s three seasons have finished, there appears to be a disconnect between the level of talent on the roster and that talent’s performance in actual games.
In two of Kiffin’s three years as USC coach, the team finished the season without receiving a single vote in the Associated Press poll, with 2011’s No. 6-ranked Trojans being the lone exception. Can that storied season be viewed as an aberration given the two that bookended it?
A look at the players Kiffin has recruited during his time at USC tells a compelling story. Though every school has its fair share of busts, there have been plenty of players USC has counted on in the past three years who haven’t even finished their playing careers as Trojans.
Standouts from the 2010 class included wide receivers Prater and Markeith Ambles, defensive end Marquis Jackson, running back Dillon Baxter and quarterback Jesse Scroggins, all of whom have transferred to different schools.
Other notable players who have yet to play up to expectations are defensive back Demetrius Wright and tailback D.J. Morgan.
The 2011 class is harder to evaluate because many players haven’t been given opportunities to contribute yet, but notable players among this class are receiver George Farmer and tailback Amir Carlisle. Farmer, widely regarded as the best high school receiver in the country in 2011, has yet to crack USC’s rotation and has only caught four passes in his first two seasons. Carlisle, who had 118 rushing yards on 19 carries in his freshman season, transferred last year to Notre Dame.
Admittedly, there were many mitigating factors in Kiffin’s recruiting of these players. Scholarship reductions and a bowl game ban for the 2010-11 seasons hindered Kiffin’s pursuits. Additionally, there have been players who have played up to their blue-chip status, such as Robert Woods, Nickell Robey and Marqise Lee. Kiffin has the reputation of an ace recruiter, and these players reaffirm that.
But in all honesty, convincing high school players to come to a school with the tradition, location and NFL connections that USC has should not be too difficult a task. It is clear that this has not been the problem with USC football’s recent fall from the upper echelon of college football programs. The problem has been getting the most out of talented players and, in some cases, keeping talent from moving to other schools.
The players that have picked up the USC hat in the past three years have, as a whole, failed to deliver. Part of this has to do with the difficulty that is inherent in projecting adolescent athletes’ progress as they reach adulthood, but another part is the tutelage they receive once they arrive on college campuses. In this regard, it is reasonable to say that USC has turned its stack of blue chips into a pile of multicolored question marks in recent years.

While the rest of the sports world had its sights set on Super Bowl XLVII, the USC men’s tennis team had its own match to focus on. But despite the distractions, the Trojans, currently ranked No. 2 in the country, took down the San Francisco Dons and the Loyola Marymount Lions in a double-header at Marks Stadium.
Free swinger · Junior Ray Sarmiento won his singles match against LMU’s Nicholas Bjerke by a score of 6-3, 6-1 on Sunday at Marks Stadium. – Ralf Cheung | Daily Trojan
The team’s first match began at 11 a.m., but the early start didn’t affect the Trojans (7-0), as they came out of the gate with strong doubles victories against the Dons. Junior Ray Sarmiento and sophomore Yannick Hanfmann cruised past their opponents with an 8-0 victory; freshman Max de Vroome and sophomore Roberto Quiroz followed suit, defeating their USF opponents 8-4. Their victory secured USC the doubles point, so the No. 3 doubles match, which featured sophomore Eric Johnson and junior Emilio Gomez, was suspended at 5-5.
The Trojans carried their momentum into singles play, winning all but one set to secure the victory over USF. Gomez, who is ranked No. 27 in the country, won 6-2, 3-0, as his opponent was forced to retire. Quiroz, who is ranked No. 24, crushed William Schumacher 6-1, 6-1, and junior Michael Grant clinched a victory for USC with a 6-2, 6-2 handling of Germain Bahri. Though sophomore Jonny Wang, ranked No. 121 by the ITA, fell in a hard-fought match, 6-3, 4-6, 1-0 (10-3), his teammates came through to lead USC to a 6-1 overall win against USF.
USC then took a short break before heading back out to face off against LMU. In between matches, the players expressed discontent about the long day, but USC coach Peter Smith said he appreciates how much playing time the doubleheader format allows his team, calling it “the best training possible.”
Once again the Trojans took control of the match early in doubles play. Hanfmann and Sarmiento wrapped up their set, 8-2, and de Vroome and Quiroz won 8-1, securing USC the doubles point. Again, the No. 3 doubles match was suspended with Gomez and Johnson up 4-3.
In singles play, Smith changed the lineup to give Gomez, Quiroz and Johnson a well-deserved break. But even without some of their most talented players, the Trojans easily outplayed the Lions.
Sarmiento was back at the No. 1 spot in singles, where he won convincingly, 6-3, 6-1. Sarmiento has been recovering from a slight abdominal strain suffered in the Sherwood Collegiate Cup, but with his impressive singles and doubles play this weekend, it was clear that the injury was hardly a setback.
“I picked up where I left off,” Sarmiento said. “My feet were under me, and I was moving well, hitting my forehand well and attacking.”
Hanfmann, ranked No. 84 by the ITA, has also been nursing some injuries. Still, he pulled off a cool 6-2, 6-2 win to keep the Trojans on track to defeat LMU. Wang bounced back from his loss in the first match to rout his LMU opponent 6-1, 6-1. Again, de Vroome, ranked No. 78 in the nation, prevailed 6-2, 6-3 over his opponent and Grant guaranteed a USC victory with his 6-2, 6-1 win. Senior Michael Tang, who is in his first season with the team, was defeated 6-1, 6-3, but the rest of the team helped earn USC a 6-1 victory over the Lions.
“I was really happy with how we played,” Smith said to sum up a near-perfect day. “They’re working hard out there and getting better.”
Indeed, the Trojans have a lot to be happy about as they continue their undefeated season. Once the team is back to full health, Smith said the team should have even more success. After ending the weekend with two matches, USC’s next match is on Friday against Cal at Marks Stadium at 1:30 p.m.
Was torrid really the right word choice?

Let’s get this out of the way now: The recruiting season is going to turn out OK for USC. Come Wednesday, national signing day, the school is going to announce a recruiting class that will, naturally, be ranked near the top of essentially every national ranking possible. So exhale. It’ll be fine. It always is.
In the wake of a disappointing 7-6 season, accentuated by a Sun Bowl loss to Georgia Tech on New Year’s Eve, you’ve read dozens of doom and gloom stories when it comes to the Trojans’ efforts on the recruiting trail. You’ve read about the de-commitments and, of course, there have been a handful of them: At least six once-USC commits reopened their recruiting process since November, seemingly the result of the disappointing 2012 campaign in which the program went from the Associated Press’ preseason No. 1 team to not receiving a single vote in the final AP poll. And so the speculation has continued: Will USC’s incoming recruiting class, once the consensus top class last July, fall apart?
Well, no. Historically speaking, USC just doesn’t appear to do anything other than hailing in top-10 recruiting classes in football come winter time. It hasn’t had a class ranked lower than No. 8 nationally, per Yahoo! Sports’ Rivals.com, since February 2002.
Moreover, isn’t it fair to give USC coach Lane Kiffin the benefit of the doubt here? For whatever shortcomings he has when it comes to leading a football program week in and week out as a head coach — and, to be clear, there are plenty — those aren’t what we’re dealing with here. Debating his recruiting prowess stands as a rather pointless exercise. The guy assembles football talent, can manage a roster and has quite the grasp on dealing with NCAA-imposed scholarship limitations. He might handle this just fine.
Look at the class as currently constructed. As of Monday night, the Trojans’ class was ranked No. 7 by Rivals, with the highest average star rating (4.43) among any school. The next closest is Notre Dame with an average of 3.87. Not to mention, seven incoming freshmen, which include four five-star prospects in defensive tackle Kenny Bigelow of Elkton, Md., quarterback Max Browne of Sammamish, Wash., defensive back Su’a Cravens of Murrieta, Calif., and defensive back Leon McQuay III of Seffner, Fl., have enrolled for the spring semester and will participate in spring practices. Browne and Cravens were also the USA Today offensive and defensive national players of the year.
“I can’t imagine a better collection of players to ever have joined a program mid-year,” Kiffin said in a statement last month. “It speaks volumes of the power of USC that four of the best players from the state of California and a trio of five-star out-of-state players chose to come here.”
Yes, it does speak to USC’s “power,” or more specifically, to its ability to recruit. But this has never really been an honest question to ask. As much concern as there has been over a recruiting class some might proclaim to be falling apart, we’re arguing over semantics here. Is USC going to have the No. 1, the No. 5 or the No. 15-ranked recruiting class? Either way, in any scenario, the program’s going to be bringing in talent, even with scholarship reductions.
USC, as a general rule, attracts talented football players, many from a Southern California region full of top-notch high school programs. And to Kiffin’s credit, he’s tapped into that during his tenure and convinced others from around the country to flock to South Los Angeles.
This is what will happen Wednesday. This is what Kiffin does this time of year. He recruits — as well as any coach there is, really. But whether the Kiffin era, to put this in black and white terms, pans out for USC ultimately won’t stem from what happens in February. It won’t stem from whether a five-star defensive end flips, or commits, or de-commits or re-commits. Not that recruiting season is irrelevant by any means, but USC’s obstacles aren’t necessarily tied to it.
It comes down to whether Kiffin can win not just in February but in November as well, to steal an old line once often used by Texas coach Mack Brown. It comes down to whether Kiffin, a collector of elite individual talent, can get USC to play elite, collectively.

It is said that success comes to those who wait, and for the newly formed USC women’s lacrosse team, this is undoubtedly true.
Ready for action · With the wealth of experience and success that head coach Lindsey Munday (center) brings, the USC women’s lacrosse team has the leadership to succeed early despite its difficult schedule. – Courtesy of USC Sports Information Dept.
 
After more than two years of waiting following the announcement of its inclusion as a varsity sport, USC will host its first varsity women’s lacrosse game on Saturday, Feb. 9, at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum against two-time defending NCAA champion Northwestern.
Leading the Women of Troy in their first match is USC coach Lindsey Munday, whose collegiate lacrosse career is among the most successful in the history of the sport. During her playing career at Northwestern, the Wildcats won the NCAA title in 2005 and 2006, becoming the first school outside the Eastern time zone to do so. Additionally, Munday twice earned first-team All-American honors and finished her career as the school’s all-time leader in assists.
“Everyone is excited to finally get this off the ground,” Munday told USCTrojans.com. “Especially the players we had last season. They’ve been training for a year and a half without a real game to play, so I think everyone’s really, really anxious and excited to get the ball rolling.”
Women’s lacrosse will become USC’s 21st intercollegiate sport and 12th women’s sport.
The team’s 26-player roster comprises 17 true freshmen, seven sophomores and just two juniors. The group of young players was picked by Munday and her two assistants: Devon Wills, defensive assistant, and Hilary Bowen, offensive assistant.
Welcoming the Women of Troy into the Division I ranks will be mighty Northwestern, winners of seven of the past eight NCAA titles and a preseason favorite to contend for the 2013 championship. Munday’s excitement to start the season was only increased by the opportunity to square off against her alma mater.
“It is so special to have our first game be against Northwestern,” Munday told USCTrojans.com. “I think for myself and Hilary [Bowen, also an NU alum], it’s extra special to play against the Wildcats … For our players, I think it will be great, too, to open up against the team that has won seven of the last eight national championships. It will certainly give us a great test, right off the bat.”
After the opening game at the Coliseum, USC will play the remainder of its home games at McAlister Field during the regular season, the same site as the school’s women’s soccer team. Though the task ahead will be tough, the early season games against top opponents will provide the young players a chance to rise to the level of play that they hope to emulate as the women’s lacrosse program expands.
As a program, the team has taken a baptism-by-fire approach in formulating its schedule.  USC will face tough teams from the eastern region of the country, where lacrosse is a more prominent sport.  Early season games against Northwestern and Massachusetts will test the Women of Troy right out of the gate before conference play begins.
Other non-conference games include road trips to Bryant in Smithfield, R.I. and Brown in Providence, R.I.  USC will then return home for games against Denver, California and Fresno State.  On April 4 the team will square off against Oregon in Eugene for the first-ever live broadcast game for USC on the Pac-12 Network.
Players who are expected to lead the inaugural team include freshmen Caroline de Lyra of Brightwaters, N.Y., and Amanda Johnson of Glen Head, N.Y.  De Lyra was named an Under Armour All-American during her senior year at Bay Shore High School and was a member of the U15 United States National Team. Johnson attended North Shore High School and was named an All-American during her senior year.
Additional players who are expected to be main contributors include freshmen Caroline Cordrey of Summit, N.J. and Courtney Tarleton of Ridgewood, N.J.  Cordrey was ranked as the No. 24 player in the nation by ESPNRise and is Summit High School’s all-time leader in scoring with 224 career goals.  Tarleton, who was named one of the team’s captains, was a two-time All-County selection in high school and was a part of three New Jersey state championship teams.
USC will compete in the Mountain Pacific Sports Federation, where it was picked to finish seventh in a preseason poll conducted by members of the media. The team’s first conference game is scheduled for Feb. 24th at McAlister Field against Saint Mary’s College. The historic season opener against Northwestern is scheduled to begin at 3 p.m.

Nutella Crepes 
Ingredients:
-1 cup flour (sifted)
-2 eggs
-1 cup milk
-1/4 tsp salt
-2 tablespoons butter (melted)
-1 stick of butter
-1 teaspoon sugar
-1 teaspoon vanilla
-Nutella to spread
-Sliced strawberries (optional)
Instructions:
In a large bowl, mix the dry ingredients of flour, salt and sugar together. In a separate bowl, whisk eggs and add the melted butter and milk. Add wet ingredients to dry ingredients and mix thoroughly. Add the vanilla to the batter.
Using the stick of butter, lightly grease a small- to medium-sized non-stick pan and heat over medium to high heat. Once hot, fill a ladle with the batter and pour into the pan. Quickly pick up the pan and tilt in a circular motion until the batter covers the entire bottom of the pan. Once the edges of the crepe turn up slightly and the bottom is light brown, flip the crepe over with a spatula and let cook for another minute or so. Repeat for the remaining batter.
Once a crepe is cooked, slide it out of the pan and place it, darker side down, onto a plate. Spread a generous amount of Nutella onto the center of the crepe and add strawberries, if so desired, fold and enjoy.

It was the upload heard ’round the world: Last Friday, online television juggernaut Netflix made history by adding an entirely original series to its instant streaming service. House of Cards, starring Oscar-winner Kevin Spacey, is the first big-budget series to be created exclusively for an online provider and could very well be the beginning of the end of television as we know it.

In the virtually untested waters of original online programming, the stakes were high for Netflix’s $100 million dollar gamble in the original debut. Netflix Chief Content Officer Ted Sarandos says the decision to commit to two seasons of House of Cards did not come lightly.
“We wanted to go all-in,” Sarandos said to the Los Angeles Times. “It’s important to signal … that we’re moving into this space in a meaningful, big way. So we did it loud.”
A glance at the show’s credits, however, suggests that “loud” is an understatement. Executive producer and partial director David Fincher is the man behind such acclaimed works as Fight Club and The Social Network. Paired together with Academy Award-nominated writer Beau Willimon, House of Cards is a series that demands to be taken seriously.
The high degree of talent on the show’s lineup is something that one might expect to find on Showtime or HBO. But when Netflix — formerly strictly a media provider, never a producer of original content — outbid every network that vied to control the show, the world of TV raised its eyebrows.
But for Modi Wiczyk, co-CEO of producing studio Media Rights Capital, which created the series, Netflix offered something far more valuable than anything the other networks could: complete artistic freedom.
“[Netflix] gave us the opportunity to be the anchor, the defining show,” Wiczyk said to USA Today about Netflix’s unprecedented 26-episode commitment before filming had even begun. “It was really kind of rare air.”
With unlimited creative control, the producers of House of Cards do not have to obey network demands for script changes or production design specifications; to the filmmakers, this freedom alone could almost be worth the enormous budget to which they are also privy.
Normal network shows are subject to changes sometimes literally while an episode is being filmed — mainly because of current ratings and reviews. “We’re telling a story. We’re gonna tell it at our pace,” actor Corey Stoll told MTV. “… That’s very hard to do when you’re worried about ratings.”
Hopefully, this decision to leave the story uncensored will be of great benefit for not only new fans of House of Cards, but also for online originals in the near future.
If Netflix’s undertaking proves to be as successful as it appears it will, a full move to original online content could be underway very soon. And if online providers follow in Netflix’s footsteps to let their filmmakers have real artistic control, then a new wave of exceptional TV and cinema could be on the way.
But perhaps more valuable to the fast-paced audiences of the digital world, dons one feature that could never be matched by traditional networks: On Feb. 1, the entire first season — not just the first episode — was posted online all at once.
It’s a move that bucks the usual network strategy of “Wait a week and we’ll give you new episodes, then wait a season, we’ll give you another season,” Sarandos told the Los Angeles Times.
But this just won’t do with modern audiences. “The Internet is attuning people to get what they want when they want it,” he said.
The instant gratification that the Internet provides is nothing new, so it seems about time for more facets of pop culture to start exploiting it. Netflix and competitors Hulu and Amazon Prime have established themselves as the standard (legal) online cinema providers, but by creating an entire original series all available in one click, Netflix has significantly upped the game.
In researching how subscribers use their websites, providers like Netflix have coined a new term, “binge-viewing,” to describe the watching of several episodes of a series in one sitting. Sarandos told investors at the BOA Merrill Lynch Media, Communications and Entertainment Conference that he noticed the significance of binge-watching when 50,000 subscribers watched the entire fourth season of Breaking Bad in a 24-hour period the day it was posted on Netflix.
Though Netflix’s competitor Hulu was technically the first to air an original drama online, the lack of a substantial budget and little critical attention prevented it from gaining much attention.
With House of Cards, that certainly isn’t a problem — and it certainly doesn’t seem it will be a problem for other online shows if they follow in Cards’ footsteps.
I watched the HBO series “the Wire” after it was on DVD. It was during a Blockbuster Special all you can watch for $25 a month.  The Wire’s, 23 DVD, five season series was highly addictive and I’m glad I didn’t have to wait for weeks for the series to complete. I did the same thing with the Band of Brothers the same winter.
Netflix I think has the right idea, in releasing a whole series at once. I can watch 2 or three shows and quit, then pick up 2 to 4 shows the next weekend. My wife and I love it.
BTW, Kevin Spacey was the right choice for the lead role. Good Show Cudo’s to Netflix.
Its a great series
poor Little Steven
no one remembers that Netflix already did an original series last year with Lilyhamer

This past weekend, I finally saw Quentin Tarantino’s latest flick, Django Unchained. And though the other moviegoers probably sat transfixed by the incredible amount of violence or horrified at the frantic use of the N-word doing the three-hour epic, I sat wondering if anyone else noticed that Jamie Foxx’s titular character was donning a pair of sunglasses.
Sunglasses. I’m not a historian, but after some simple research and a small amount of common sense, I realized that cowboys in the South, especially freed slaves, didn’t rock a pair of John Lennon-shaded specs while horseback riding.
Now, though, some have been angry over Tarantino’s obvious distortions of history, it’s imperative to realize that Tarantino knows exactly what he is doing. He’s not trying to educate our young — he’s trying to entertain them.
And I get that, I really do. But I can’t help but get a bit annoyed over Django’s sunglasses. For me, it gave me a hard slap in the face, dragging me out of the magic of the film and into the epiphany that I was simply watching a movie. I go to the cinema to be entertained, to escape into a magical world of wonder and it seemed as if Tarantino wanted to force me out of it.
It seems like such a small thing, but costumes — especially those in period pieces can make or break a film. Often, the costumes are the film. Remember Atonement? It was a decent movie with decent performances. Remember Keira Knightley’s stunner of a green dress in the film? Now that was a showstopper.
The same goes for Emma Stone’s red gown from the dud Gangster Squad. Ryan Gosling’s Jerry Wooter asks “Who’s the tomato?” and our eyes turn to the drop-dead gorgeous siren on the screen. Red hair dyed to match the cherry color of a chiffon masterpiece, high slits on both sides and a tasteful neckline.
Though a film’s costumes might elevate it from yawn-inducing to somewhat intriguing, the main purpose of the costume is to help actors get into character. It was probably difficult for the cast of Lincoln to completely immerse themselves in the time period, but donning the clothes of the day helped. As Lincoln’s wife Mary Todd, Sally Field was dressed in historically accurate clothes that attempted to transform the petite two-time Oscar winner into the rather plain-looking wife.
Joanna Johnston, the costume designer of the film, and current Oscar nominee, told Vanity Fair that Mary Todd “wasn’t a great looker … but I think the over-trussing of her, her adornments, clothes, headdresses and bonnets, helped her look great in a way.”
To the naked eye, Sally Field was just traversing around in big fancy dresses, but put in context, these fancy frocks, which were extremely difficult to walk or sit in, added layers to the character — she was in a constant state of trying to prove herself.
So now it’s easier to see why Django’s sunglasses got me so up in arms. Instead of adding to the story, instead of further immersing the actors and the audience into this imaginary world, we were distracted by the sunglasses. Leonardo DiCaprio as slave master Calvin Candie, could have pulled out a cell phone in the next scene.
Honestly, costumes might be the most important part of a film. No matter how great your actress is, if the wardrobe does not match her part, then all of that hard work is thrown out of the window. Total immersion into a character from the inside out comes from the help of a wardrobe and makeup department. Jennifer Lawrence was magnificent in Silver Linings Playbook, and one of the reasons why is because her character Tiffany actually looked like the girl-next-door in Philly. Director David O. Russell didn’t try to make her look like the Hollywood starlet she is. She wore her hair in a messy bun. She wore cheap clothes but tried to make them look sexy in the way that we all do. There was no Dolce & Gabbana, no Armani. Just Tiffany.
And as the Oscars approach, the top costume designers of the year will go head-to-head — or stitch-to-stitch — for the honor. As the Academy typically honors rather grandiose period films, the costume designers of Anna Karenina (Jacqueline Durran), Les Misérables (Paco Delgado), Lincoln (Joanna Johnston), Mirror Mirror (the infamous Eiko Ishioka) and Snow White and the Huntsman (another legend, Colleen Atwood) are all nominated. All five films are feats of costuming and any of them could win. The true winner, however, is the audience, for getting the chance to be lost once again in the magic of filmmaking, with a little help from a sewing machine and the imagination of a costume designer.

When one thinks of a food critic, one might summon up the image of a pretentious, but well-trained expert in food — the kind of person whose nose is permanently stuck in the air.
Bon appetit · L.A. Foodie founder Drew Hubbard shows off his “I Burger L.A.” shirt. The shirt, sold on L.A. Foodie’s website, is popular among fans. – Tanaya Ghosh | Daily Trojan
 
That image of a stuck-up culinary connoisseur could not be further from the truth when it comes to describing Drew Hubbard and Ben Waters, the founders of the popular LA Foodie podcast.
Though these two high school friends might identify as food critics, they come off just as their podcast makes them seem: fun and relaxed. They aren’t afraid of enjoying all types of foods, and were even all right with serving Doritos and Oreos as party snacks at their Super Bowl party on Sunday.
In LA Foodie, however, the food is a little less generic. The Kansas City transplants have taken advantage of the fact that they live in one of the food capitals of the world and have set out to share all that Los Angeles has to offer with their listeners.
The site, which began as a blog and expanded to include a podcast, centers on the idea of being a tourist in your own city. Hubbard came up with the idea when he was working at a digital marketing agency. Just for fun, he began to experiment with websites and stumbled onto the idea of reviewing his favorite haunts.
According to Hubbard, 2008 was the perfect year to use as a launching point for the site.
“That was the time food became kind of sexy,” Hubbard said. “[It was] right at the time L.A. started becoming an awesome restaurant town.”
In 2011, he encouraged his high school friend Waters to come aboard. Waters, who had a background in television production and editing, had been listening to podcasts for a while and was easily persuaded to come aboard. Though this is their first time working together, Hubbard said that the allure of podcasting stems from their shared love for performance.
“It sounded like fun,” Waters said. “I had never produced a podcast, but I listened to a lot of them, and I found that many of them were quite boring. I wanted to make a segmented podcast, not one where you’re overhearing somebody else’s conversation.”
Together, their culinary blog and podcast has featured some of the best of Los Angeles food culture. As they munched on chips and dip waiting for the Super Bowl to start, they encouraged USC students to adopt a tourist philosophy when they explore culinary options in their backyard.
Off the top of their head, they suggested a stop-by-stop restaurant tour that students can take from the Exposition/Culver City Metro line, which passes right by USC.
First stop: right next to campus, at the Expo/USC station, the foodies highly recommended the food court-style group of restaurants next to USC at Mercado La Paloma, which features cuisine ranging from burgers to Thai food. They said the community effect gives the group of restaurants a “cool food experience.”
A Chinese restaurant named Ko Sai Kai is located at the Expo/Western station. Though they referenced Taken when they described the restaurant’s setting, Hubbard and Waters said that restaurant had amazing appetizers and recommended ordering the dumplings and egg rolls. Meanwhile, Earlez Grille is their suggestion for the Crenshaw stop. The store has a wide selection of hot dogs and comfort food, and the duo especially recommends the restaurant’s banana pudding.
For those who enjoy seafood, Mel’s Fish Shack at the Farmdale stop is a required visit. For those that visit, Hubbard and Waters agreed that the grilled shrimp is a necessary choice.
Next, at the La Brea stop, they recommend CJ’s Cafe. The guys describe the restaurant as a “soul food-esque, Mexican brunch joint.” They suggest the chicken wings and waffles topped with tons of maple syrup.
At La Cienega, Hubbard and Waters said the choice was easy: J.R.’s BBQ. The restaurant has outrageous chicken sausages, which are made on-site daily.
Finally, near the Culver City station, they recommend a restaurant supply store called Surfas that doubles as a cafe. The restaurant, which is open only for lunch,  is an “unsung” part of Culver City, they said.
Hubbard and Waters clearly love to talk about food and for them, LA Foodie is a pursuit of passion. Today, the site has produced 36 podcasts, 404 blog posts and 6,311 tweets. They have a loyal audience and now many restaurants come to them to request to be featured on the blog, something Hubbard described as a “f-cking awesome problem.”
Hubbard and Waters said what lies in the future for LA Foodie is building it into a sustainable business. But success often follows passion, and the duo seems primed for another wave of success.

A few months ago, amid the stress of finals week, a group of freshmen looking for a creative outlet decided to publish a satirical newspaper centered on the humorous happenings around the USC campus. They did some brainstorming, drew up a plan and started to write, continuing to write through winter break. When the spring semester began, they successfully launched the Sack of Troy, an online satirical newspaper that has started to gain traction among USC students.
Funny freshmen · The founders of Sack of Troy, Asher Levy, Axel Hellman, Matt Kalina and Dylan Abrams (left to right) say that they modeled their website after the satiricle website The Onion. — Leigh Jacobson | Daily Trojan
These freshmen behind Sack of Troy include Editor-in-Chief Axel Hellman, Finance and Promotion Chair Dylan Abrams and Webmaster Matt Kalina, all residents of the sixth floor of Birnkrant Residential Hall.
After spending some time exchanging stories and poking fun at various absurdities at USC, as well as reading satirical newspapers from other schools, they decided to create a newspaper of their own.
“Axel approached Matt and I with the brilliant idea of starting our own and, after a few weeks of preparation, we launched our site,” Abrams said.
With no formal comedic experience, they drew inspiration from a variety of sources.
“We modeled the style of our satire news articles off of The Onion, which is probably the best-known humor/satire paper,” Hellman said. “We were also inspired by The Tulane Vignette, a similar publication run by a student at Tulane who is friends with Dylan.”
Sack of Troy’s website, which promises to deliver “reliable, accurate and fictitious news about USC,” features an archive of about 20 articles, comical author bios and a link for readers to contact the authors with questions or article ideas.
Their goal is simple: to provide the USC community with funny, light-hearted stories about students’ experiences on campus with headlines such as “Kaufman School to Offer Pole Dancing Class,” “USC Ranked Most Secure Prison in Southern California” and “Right Wing Activists Protest Shrine Auditorium’s Islam Influence.”
Several undergraduate students have expressed their interest and amusement with the articles.
“I check it almost every day and laugh every time I do,” said Heather Persson, a freshman majoring in international relations.
Hellman, Abrams and Kalina are not the only ones involved in this comedic endeavor. Calvin Boyd, a freshman majoring in architecture and Abrams’ roommate, designed the Sack’s logo. Freshmen Jordan Klein, a computer science major, and Morgan Greenwald, a neuroscience major and Daily Trojan staff member, have also written articles.
In terms of spreading the word about the Sack, Abrams said that a lot of their focus is online, noting that Facebook and Twitter are their primary mediums for promotion — though that’s certainly not all they’re doing. Besides doing that and counting on people to hear about the Sack of Troy through word of mouth, Abrams said they’ve been seeking multiple campus promotional partners.
“We promote ourselves in different newsletters on campus, through KXSC and hopefully Trojan Vision, and we’re in the process of designing fliers that can be posted around campus in order to increase our viewership,” Abrams said.
Though the Sack is run by a tight group of Birnkrant friends, they strongly encourage outsiders to pitch in and contribute. The Sack of Troy posts multiple articles every week and is looking to add new sections including entertainment, to its website.
“We are always looking to expand our writers circle,” Abrams said.  “We love when people express enthusiasm and are interested in writing for the Sack.”
 
The Sack of Troy is published online at  sackoftroy.com.
I didn’t find it funny at all.
This is really great satire, what you might expect appearing at Yale or Harvard. Sack of Troy provides palpable evidence that President Nikias’ goal of attracting the best and brightest students (and most creative) is being met.
Congratulations to the Sack of Troy staff for their topical, entertaining, sophisticated product and to USC for being successful in attracting these and many other top students.

USC after-hours medical care needs urgent reform
As USC shifts toward a residential community, it must adapt to meet the health needs of its students after business hours.
The current system is in dire need of reform. Twice now this year, my roommate and I have faced health issues USC failed to address because of nonexistent after-hours assistance.
The first time, we called the “24/7” health care after-hours number only to be routed to a clinic in Maine. We chose the local hospital instead.
The second time, we discovered that the “Medical Services Urgent Care” USC webpage was blank. With few other options, we went to the brand-new $15 million dollar health center in person only to be told weekend hours were 10:00 a.m. to 2:00 p.m. We were an hour late and no further assistance or options were offered.
Despite the $253 Student Health Center Service fee every semester, not to mention the Student Health Insurance fee, the general message to students seems to be that if you get injured on the weekend, make sure it is during the prescribed four-hour window. Otherwise, good luck.
With no urgent care clinic nearby, after-hours treatment options at present appear limited to either personal first aid or the hospital. As a world-class university, USC can do better.
Student health should be a 24/7 priority, and USC’s approach to after-hours care needs attention. Especially with the vast majority of students living within biking distance of campus, we urge the university to re-examine its current policy on after-hours care. USC has demonstrated an ability to respond to safety concerns in the past. We hope this trend continues.

In response to failed flight
The Daily Trojan recently ran a front page photograph of the USC Quidditch team in action vs. UCLA.  Nothing against Harry Potter — but a much bigger and more relevant story would be why the University of Southern California can’t field an NCAA Division I Men’s Soccer Team annually.  I am all for Title IX and equality in sports and am happy to see new opportunities being developed for handicapped athletes.  However, every other major college in California and the nation seem to be able to field a competitive men’s soccer team except USC — and they all have to abide by the same rules.

As the pro-choice and pro-life debate rages on across the country, institutions of higher learning have found themselves caught in the crossfire.
Daniel Razzano | Daily Trojan
Shippensburg University, a college located in Shippensburg, Pa., became a topic of national discussion when it installed what has been called America’s first Plan B vending machine http://www.ibtimes.com/shippensburg-university-plan-b-vending-machine-what-plan-b-407398in early 2012.
And though many have argued over the safety and legality of the machine, the Food and Drug Administration released a statement last week declaring that Shippensburg’s actions are completely legal, and the university will be allowed to keep its machine.
With the approval of the FDA, one might think that progressive women’s reproductive rights were starting to gain some traction in terms of legality. Unfortunately, it has only divided the country further. Pushing religious reasons aside, it’s imperative to examine just what benefits a Plan B vending machine would provide for any college or university in the United States.
Though some are under the false assumption that Plan B is a dangerous “abortion pill,” the drug itself actually contains less harmful chemicals than the typical aspirin and, if taken within 72 hours after unprotected sex, it will simply prevent pregnancy — not terminate one.
According to the Centers for Disease Control, around 49 percent of pregnancies in the U.S. are considered “unwanted pregnancies.” And considering the fact that not all of these women have access to proper family planning and healthcare, a large fraction of that percentage will actually give birth to their babies, who were “unwanted” in the first place.
This is not some liberal agenda put forth by our government — these are the facts. And our government’s main priority should be keeping its citizens safe and protected — whether it’s overseas or in our beds. By allowing something as simple as a Plan B vending machine to take root in our schools, perhaps the stigma of sexual safety will soon dissipate.
And Shippensburg didn’t force this idea upon its students. In fact, the university only thought of the idea after it conducted a survey in which 85 percent of students declared that they wished that they had better access to Plan B on campus grounds. For some women, asking for Plan B can be awkward and uncomfortable, and by removing the middleman, they might feel more safe and comfortable purchasing it.
And it’s not like any 14-year-old girl could walk up to the machine and buy some Plan B. To keep everyone safe, Shippensburg installed an ID swipe, which verifies the age of the purchaser. Plus, the product is only $25 in contrast to the $50+ one generally pays in a pharmacy.
The existence of a Plan B vending machine doesn’t mean that everyone who has sex must immediately purchase a pack out of it just as the existence of an abortion clinic doesn’t mean that everyone who gets pregnant must have an abortion. The important thing is allowing every woman the ability to choose what happens to her own body.
Hopefully, more colleges will take this cue and offer similar machines on their campuses. Access to Plan B can only help the issue of unwanted teen pregnancies. Students at USC are lucky enough to attend a school that offers counseling and several pharmacies located close by; many students across the country do not have that option.
The pro-choice/pro-life debate is one of such vitriolic attitudes that it’s bound to make a mark on our generation. Instead of focusing on the facts and welfare of the women in our nation, some have chosen to push their ideologies and religious beliefs on the whole population.
College students are not going to stop having sex, and forcing one to have a baby is not an adequate punishment. It is time that America begins to have serious discussions toward making a final, legal and justified decision on the issue of contraceptive rights.

I have heard Pi Phi has a vending machine in the bathroom
There’s always Plan A – Abstinence.  I know, I know, it’s a dirty word…
Yes it is a dirty word. But parents have to be delusional to think that college kids are going to practice abstinence once they are away from home. Its even wishful thinking for them to practice it in High School while still living at home. We can not continue to pretend that pushing for abstinence will prevent kids from having sex. The fact is kids will have sex. And so it is our responsibility to help them when something goes wrong ie a broken condom. The vending machine at this college should be a model for other colleges to follow. Providing access to as much help as possible is a responsibility we cannot ignore.

The day after the Super Bowl, most people are spending more time discussing Beyoncé’s latest exhibition of vocal magnificence than the Baltimore Ravens’ well-deserved win. Yet the most interesting thing about this year’s Super Bowl has less to do with the stadium-wide New Orleans power shortage and more to do with the entertainment in between all of the actual playing: the Super Bowl advertisements.
Daniel Razzano | Daily Trojan
By far the most expensive slot of television airtime, a typical 30-second advertisement costs companies about $4 million. While most of the advertisements are ranked and critiqued by the public the next day, very few ask the question that matters most: Do these ads actually have any sort of effect?
Fortunately for the companies that chose to air commercials this year, it appears that they do. Analysts argue that a product or service advertised at the Super Bowl does significantly better than its competitors, if the advertisement is used effectively. The Northwestern University Kellogg Super Bowl Advertising Review found a correlation between Super Bowl ads and share prices: It appeared that advertisements during the Super Bowl generated more interest in kinds of traffic, drawing attention towards its shares in the market.
Despite these statistics, the true value of a Super Bowl ad is not easy to explore.In an article in Yahoo! Finance, Senior Editor Derek Thompson said that “measuring the effectiveness of advertising is devilishly difficult, because it’s practically impossible to pinpoint the moment that millions of very different people made up their mind to buy something.”
This year, 108.4 million viewers tuned in to watch the sibling coaches of the San Francisco 49ers and the Baltimore Ravens battle it out in the Big Easy. Sunday marked the seventh straight year in which more people watched the Super Bowl than the previous year, indicating that consumer interest is on a steady ascent. Compared to the average 20 million viewers who regularly watch Sunday Night Football, the numbers for the Super Bowl are astonishingly high. Combined with the staggering fact that a simple Google search for “Super Bowl advertisement” mere hours after the event returns over 226 million results, it’s quite obvious to see just how important a short commercial could be.
The most compelling thing about the Super Bowl, however, is the fundamental difference between the Super Bowl and regularly scheduled television programming. With the advent of DVR and TiVo, instruments that allow viewers to skip commercials with ease, consumers are no longer required to sit through commercials in order to watch their favorite television program. The Super Bowl, however, is broadcast live, and sports fans have motivation to watch their favorite teams play in live time, commercials and all. And the reputation of the ads’ quality has an effect too — audiences might even find themselves glued to their seats during commercials, afraid of missing the next viral sensation.
The effect is monumental — and the excellence of the ads reflects that. Companies spend substantially more money on a Super Bowl ad than on a regular one; and newspapers, magazines and online blogs spend most of the Monday after the Super Bowl, not only analyzing each and every advertisement for its creativity, originality and impact, but actually ranking them. For the advertising industry, the attention paid to Super Bowl ads is nothing short of incredible.
So, as the dust settles from the 2013 Super Bowl battle, consumers should think about the amount of business rationale that goes behind a company’s decision to spend $4 million on a single advertisement that, in most cases, airs only once.
Behind the hard work and sweat of the athletes, and the glamour of watching Beyoncé (literally) blow the lights out with her performance, the true meaning of the Super Bowl has more financial significance than we realize. As Thompson says, the Super Bowl is “a national media event where people beg the room to quiet down so they can hear branded messages brought to them by multinational corporations. At $4 million, that’s not a rip-off. It’s a steal.”
For the companies involved, it’s a gold mine while audiences get to be entertained.

A Dept. of Public Safety officer and his fiancee were found late Sunday dead from gunshots in a parked car in Irvine, Calif.
The victims, who were found in the vehicle at about 9:10 p.m., were identified as Keith Lawrence, 27, and Monica Quan, 28. Gunshots were not reported that night, and the bodies were only found after a passerby noticed Lawrence slumped over the steering wheel, according to police. Law enforcement officials are continuing to investigate the crime as a double homicide, not a murder-suicide.
Lawrence joined DPS in August 2012 and at the time of his death was assigned to patrol operations, according to DPS Capt David Carlisle. He was an armed officer and a graduate of the Ventura County Sheriff’s Academy. His fiancee Quan was a assistant basketball coach for the Cal State Fullerton women’s team. Both were graduates of Concordia University.
DPS Chief John Thomas released a statement Monday regarding the shooting:
“It is with great sadness and a very heavy heart that I announce the untimely death of a member of the DPS Family, PSO I Keith Lawrence.  Officer Lawrence and his fiancée were discovered deceased earlier this morning; victims of a senseless act of violence in the City of Irvine.
During his brief tenure of service here at USC, Officer Lawrence proved to be an honorable, compassionate and professional member of our department and the Trojan Family.  We are a better department and the USC Campus Community is a safer place as a result of his service.
Please continue to espouse those same values of honor, commitment to duty, professionalism and compassion as we continue to add to his legacy and those that we all share as members of the law enforcement/public safety community.
I would also ask that you remember Keith and his fiancée’s families in your thoughts and prayers as they grieve and begin the healing process and move forward from this tragic loss of their loved ones.”
 
 
 
Rest in peace brother.
RIP Keith and Monica. Members of the Trojan Family in life and in death.
Very sad story. Hope they rest in peace.

Undergraduate Student Government candidates posted their signs along Trousdale Parkway Monday at midnight to signal the beginning of the election season.
Students will elect the candidates for president, vice president and senators Tuesday, Feb. 12, through Thursday, Feb. 14.
The two presidential tickets’ signs have the same color scheme of blue, black and white. Each ticket had a team of about 10 students to help place signs between Jefferson and Exposition boulevards.
Presidential candidate and current Speaker Pro Tempore of the USG sentate Matthew Arkfeld, and Vice Presidential Candidate Alexander Cascante, a Greek senator, are campaigning under the slogan of “Think Different.” They said their slogan encompass their goals for the election.
“We want to get the whole student body incentivized, advocating for change and making it better for everyone,” Arkfeld said. “We want to make this night important. It’s about the change for everyone, and not our names on the change”
Arkfeld and Cascante noted that a quarter of the student body voted in the past election.
Presidential candidate Christian Kurth, the current USG director of university affairs, and Ryan Park, vice presidential candidate and current Greek senator, said exposure is a vital element of their campaign.
“We want to get to know as many people as possible,” Kurth said. “We want the student body to get to know our personality and we plan on being out here [on Trousdale Parkway] all day everyday.”
Both campaigns viewed the midnight sign posting as an important tradition in the USG election season.
“USC and tradition are one in the same. They go hand in hand. So it’s symbolic and practical that we be out here tonight,” Park said.
Cascante also recognized the significance of Trousdale Parkway to the university as a whole.
“Trousdale Parkway is the 405 Hwy of USC,” Cascante said. “So many students walk down it everyday, so [midnight campaigning]  is a staple of the election every year.”
Candidates running for senator positions also were out placing their signs with the help of their constituents.
Candidates can campaign throughout the week and events are scheduled for the student body to understand the candidates’ platforms more. A diversity forum will be held Monday night at 6 p.m. in room 450 of the Ronald Tutor Campus Center and the presidential debate will be held Wednesday.
Voting takes place Feb. 12 through 14.

Undergraduate Student Government candidates began campaigning today by positing posters and signs around campus.
The annual election season introduces students to the candidates who they will vote for next week.
This year’s ballot includes two presidential tickets. Presidential candidate Matthew Arkfeld, current USG Senate speaker pro tempore, is running with Alexander Cascante, a Greek senator. Presidential candidate Christian Kurth, the USG director of university affairs, is running with Ryan Park, currently a Greek senator.
There are also 27 contenders running for 12 senator positions, which are split into commuter, Greek and residential constituencies.
The election kicked off just after midnight, at which time candidates traditionally place their posters along Trousdale Parkway and are allowed to launch advertisements on social media.
Throughout the week, candidates will defend their stances and answer questions from students and organizations, first tonight at 6 p.m. in room 450 of the Tutor Campus Center at a diversity forum hosted by USC Program Board and at a presidential debate on Wednesday. At both events, candidates will be asked to address certain issues regarding the USC community in addition to presenting an argument for their candidacies and platforms.
After a week of campaigning, students will have the opportunity to vote for their preferred candidates any time during Feb. 12-14. The unofficial results of the election will be announced during a Senate meeting on Feb. 19.
Current USG Vice President Vinnie Prasad said USG hopes for a high voter turnout this year, saying student votes are the best way to measure which issues students want addressed during the coming school year.
“High voter turnout is the biggest goal for this year’s election,” Prasad said. “The USG is really empowered by the fact that a lot of students vote, and the more students that vote, the more voices we’re getting as to what we should be doing for the whole next year.”
USG Director of Communications Kelly Hann said 5,546 students voted in the election last year. In 2011, 5,741 students voted, up from 4,684 students in 2010.
USG advocates for student issues and puts on events for the student body. The government comprises the legislative, executive, programming and judicial branches. After the election, the president and vice president will appoint the five other executive cabinet members of the government to be sworn in by April.
