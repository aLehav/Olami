Web Services is working toward customizing myUSC website’s design by the end of the spring semester so that the new portal will allow students to connect to online services at USC easier.
The myUSC website was built in 2005 and developers think that it’s time to redesign and add new technologies to make it a better experience for students.
“We are working on making the new myUSC more functional and sophisticated on all of your devices, especially your smartphone, so that you can get things done wherever you are,” ITS Director of Web Services Candace Borland said in an email to the Daily Trojan.
The new design has a modern style that works optimally on screens of any size. It lets users customize what they see and in what order on their myUSC home page.
“Currently, we are developing options for students who prefer to access information at a glance and maintain a clean, minimal interface,” Borland said.
The major differences from the old design are that the new myUSC runs on new servers, with a completely modern software infrastructure. The new interface and updated coding allows for information to be added faster and customized content to be created for individuals and groups. The new design allows increased content on the homepage and the software has been updated for bugs.
The new design aims to improve the student experience by making it easier and faster for students to find USC-related information directly from their phones. After the update, students will be able to use more myUSC-related programs from their smartphones.
The new portal design is currently in beta, or pre-release, testing at http://trymy.usc.edu. Thousands of students have logged in so far, and hundreds of students have sent their feedback. The Web Services team encourages students to take a few minutes to log into the beta version and notify them if they have any problems, recommendations or improvements.
“Our goal is to launch version one of the new portal by the end of the spring semester, at which time you will be able to reach it at http://my.usc.edu,” Borland said. “We will turn off the old portal at that time.”
The ITS Web Services and Enterprise Applications groups have been collaborating on designing and building the new portal.
“We have conducted student focus groups and surveys and are now soliciting direct feedback from students using the new portal,” Borland said. “We have also been consulting with various USC departments about what their students need.”
The new myUSC portal is designed to evolve with the changing needs of students and the rest of the University.

After splitting a grueling weekend against two of the nation’s top teams, the No. 7 USC women’s swimming team will face off against its final regular season opponent this Friday when the Trojans take on the No. 19 UCLA Bruins in Westwood.
With regard to rankings and records, the Bruins (6-3, 3-3 Pac-12) don’t quite stack up to the Trojans’ opponents of this past weekend, but USC (7-2, 5-1) will have to come out of the gates with the same intensity as they did against Cal and Stanford in order to have a successful conclusion to the season.
UCLA is coming off a weekend against the same opponents, but the Bruins didn’t have quite as much success. While the Trojans came out of the weekend with a plus-two differential against the Bears and the Cardinal, UCLA fell to both schools by a combined 135 points. With the Pac-12 Championships just a week and a half away, each crosstown rival would love to head into the postseason with a little more momentum than the other.
Despite the Bruins’ lower ranking, beating them in their pool is no easy task. USC head coach Dave Salo, in his 10th year at the helm, knows better than to overlook the Bruins in Westwood.
“They always swim lights-out at home,” Salo said. “We know it’s going to be a tough battle against a strong team in a hostile environment.”
Still, the Trojans might just have an edge in a venue that, on paper, should be stacked against them.
“Our secret weapon will be our men’s team and our parent and booster clubs,” Salo said. “We would rather swim at home, but a win at the opposing team’s pool is always special.”
Judging by past performances this season, the Trojans have the edge in just about every category when matched up against UCLA. So far, USC has outperformed UCLA in each of the different 16 events, with the exception of both diving events and the 400-yard individual medley relay.
Senior co-captains Lucy Worrall and Kendyl Stewart will look to improve upon last weekend’s results, which included a toppling of the reigning NCAA champion Cal and a slim 4-point defeat at the hands of the Stanford, the nation’s second-ranked team. The seniors won’t be the only swimmers to watch, however, as a pair of freshmen dazzled against Cal and Stanford — Allie Wooden and Elizabeth Stinson finished first and second, respectively, two meets in a row in the 1000-yard freestyle, and they will hope to continue their success in Westwood.
After the meet against UCLA, the Trojans will head into the Pac-12 championships beginning Feb. 24 in Washington. Depending on their performance in the conference tournament, they may be selected to participate in the NCAA championships, which take place in the middle of March.
The action begins Friday at 2 p.m. at UCLA’s Spieker Aquatics Center.
First beating the ‘ruins is not  a problem. Some new format that  would prevent the team from making the ncaa championship?
Ranked 7th in the country not enough to send the best there? What you talkin’ about Kurtis.
It appears that Coach Salo has had way too many years to get the team to the top with his coaching and recruiting.

As human beings with carried emotions, it’s naturally hard to let go, whatever it may be. When a lot of us were kids, we didn’t want to let go of our parent’s hands. As we grew older, we couldn’t bear saying goodbye to a favorite TV show. Now as young adults on the brink of falling into the “real world,” many of us don’t want to even think about closing the book on perhaps the best four or so years of our lives. Every now and then, though, Father Time comes knocking on the door saying it’s time to move on, and in almost all cases, it’s in your best interest that you do.
This couldn’t be more apparent than in the case of USC Athletic Director Pat Haden, who was reportedly transported to a hospital by ambulance after experiencing an episode of lightheadedness on campus Wednesday. This development comes less than a week after it was announced that Haden will retire from his position in June, though he will stay on for an extra year in a different capacity in order to spearhead the $270 million renovation of the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum. Unfortunately, this is not the 63-year-old Haden’s first run-in with health issues in recent months. In October, he was attended to by medical personnel on the sidelines of Notre Dame Stadium after experiencing similar symptoms of lightheadedness. Haden also has a pacemaker.
In the fall, I wrote a column expressing my concern for Haden’s health after he resigned from the College Football Playoff selection committee for exactly that reason. Rumors of Haden’s intent to step down from his post of athletic director had been swirling around Heritage Hall for months before last Friday’s big announcement. It’s hard to say why Haden waited until just recently to make his retirement official, being forced to deal with the criticisms of a coaching search and a former head coach’s lawsuit in between.
It’s safe to say that in the best interest of living a long and healthy life, especially after Wednesday’s events, Haden is making the right decision in deciding to retire, though I don’t think it’s quite as easy for him to let go, especially after all that he has done to push his alma mater back in the right direction.
Haden isn’t alone in his predicament, though, in an awkward time now for one of the NFL’s greatest quarterbacks, who can’t seemingly decide whether to retire, or at least when to tell everyone what he might have determined months ago.
The question on everyone’s minds heading into Super Bowl 50 this past weekend was not whether the Denver Broncos or Carolina Panthers was going to come out on top. Instead, there was a giant elephant in the room continuously present throughout the annual spectacle: Was Peyton Manning finally going to announce his retirement? At 39, Manning became the oldest quarterback to both start and win a Super Bowl, which would provide a storybook ending to one of the most decorated careers in NFL history.
In his postgame interview, Manning mentioned that he would take some time to reflect and drink a lot of Budweiser the night of but gave no direct answer to if he intended to hang up his cleats for good. After completing 13 of 23 passes for just 141 yards to go along with an interception, though, all indicators point to this “Super Bowl winning” performance being his last rodeo — a main reason being the nagging injuries that he has dealt with in recent years.
Perhaps, you could even go the lengths of comparing Manning’s situation to that of Kobe Bryant. Though Bryant’s Lakers team hasn’t been as competitive as Manning’s Broncos, there was, indeed, a gray area for a long time of whether this season would be his last.
As one of the greatest competitors of all time, I don’t think it could have been any harder for someone like Bryant to admit it’s time to move on, but ever since he decided to pull the trigger in a Player’s Tribune letter, it’s only been downhill for him, getting the farewell tour that he so very much deserved.
It’s too late for Manning to get a farewell tour like Bryant or Derek Jeter did if he were to retire now, but it would surely instill a peace of mind in not only his mind, but that of his fans as well.
Manning, Bryant or even Haden wouldn’t be the professionals we thought they were if they didn’t at least try to make a fuss when Father Time came knocking, but now that he has gotten in the door and refused to leave, it’s probably a sign to just let go.
It will be difficult for all of those involved, but it’s the only way everyone can truly say goodbye and move on. It’s not the end of the world, but it is truly the end of an era.

Fresh off two convincing wins to start their 2016 campaign, the No. 2 USC women’s water polo team will travel to La Jolla to play in the Triton Invitational this weekend.
The Trojans will square off against Santa Clara at 8 a.m. Saturday and the winner of the UC San Diego-Indiana game at 2:40 p.m. If USC comes away with both wins Saturday, they will advance to the semifinals at 12:30 p.m. Sunday and to the championship at 5:50 p.m. the same day.
In order to claim the title, the Women of Troy will likely have to get past top-ranked UCLA in the championship match.
“We’ve been conditioning hard and working on our team chemistry to get ready for big games,” junior two-meter Brigitta Games said. “This weekend will test our hard work.”
The Trojans will lean on junior two-meter Avery Peterson, one of their captains and the leading scorer in the conference, averaging 4.5 goals per game early on in the season.
“It gives me confidence knowing I can come out and score, but I have to give a lot of credit to my teammates with setting me up with those opportunities,” Peterson said. “I’m thankful for them being a part of this team.”
Pre-season NCAA and MPSF women’s water polo is in full force after a packed weekend of match-ups. While USC took down UC San Diego and Whittier this past weekend, top-ranked Stanford fell to the No. 2 spot after losing to Cal 5-2 in Stanford’s own tournament.
Following the upset, UCLA and USC have both taken over the No. 1 and 2 spots, respectively, in the rankings. The Trojans outscored UC San Diego and Whittier by a combined score a 45-6.
“Our goal was to focus on defense and keep the other team to a low score,” Peterson said. “When we have good defense, it helps produce our offensive game.”
Heading into this week, the Trojans hope to cling on to their top two spot. The Women of Troy faced off with the Brazilian national team Wednesday to get ready for the weekend games.
Last season, USC won the Triton Invitational, sweeping four opponents and beating UC Irvine 10-5 in the title match.

The indoor track and field season continues this weekend as USC competes in the Tyson Invitational in Arkansas. The 17th-ranked men’s team and seventh-ranked women’s team seek to continue their good form. Last weekend, the Trojans battled their opposition and the high altitude as they competed in the New Mexico Classic in Albuquerque. They overcame those challenges to secure four wins — a shotput sweep, men’s triple jump, women’s 4x400m relay — a school record in the women’s 4×400 relay and several personal bests.
The events in Fayetteville will kick off Friday with the women’s mile run. Junior Destinee Brown, who placed sixth in this event’s finals last weekend, will be joined by sophomore Deanna Hill, who placed fifth in the same event, Gabriella Cantrell, a sophomore who narrowly missed out on last weekend’s 60m finals, as well as sophomore Ky Westbrook and senior Alexis Faulknor.
The men’s 60m dash will include freshman Dominic Davis, senior Just’N Thymes and sophomore Adoree’ Jackson, who placed fourth overall in last weekend’s 60m final. Sophomore Ricky Morgan Jr, redshirt freshman Zyaire Clemes, Thymes and sophomore Jadon Joyner, who posted a time of 22.10s alongside Jackson last week, will represent USC in the men’s 200-meter dash this weekend.
The women’s 200m dash will involve seven Women of Troy — all of the 60m dash competitors as well as Jasmyne Graham and Jaide Stepter. Hill will look to get first place this time around, as she was beaten out for it by a mere 0.003 seconds in Albuquerque. Cantrell will try to improve the already great time of 23.65s she posted in the finals last weekend.
Stepter will hope to win again in the women’s 400m dash, after she posted a new school record at 52.30s in the finals. The Trojans must have liked Albuquerque’s banked track because right behind her were junior Amalie Iuel, with a second place time of 52.73s and sophomore Kendall Ellis, in third place, with a time of 53.42s. For the men’s 400m dash, USC will be sending Clemes and sophomore Ricky Morgan Jr., who managed a sixth place overall in the New Mexico Classic’s 400m finals.
The Trojans were competitive in last week’s 4x400m relay races and will try to be once again. The men and women’s squads will both feature one change from last week’s successful squads. The women’s roster will include Ellis, Iuel, Stepter and Cameron Pettigrew, who will be replacing  Hill. The men feature Clemes, Morgan Jr., Jackson and Robert Ford. The women’s one-mile race will feature seniors Katerina Berdousi and Jenna Tong, who placed 3rd and 7th respectively last weekend. The pair will also compete in the women’s 3000m run alongside sophomore Rebekah Ent. Freshmen pair Nicolaus Jakowec and Trent Rule will compete in the men’s 3000m.
Ford and Jordon Wallin, two sophomores, will participate in the men’s 800m race, while as many as four Trojan women — redshirt sophomore Rebekah Ent, freshman Rachel Glynn, Pettigrew and freshman Mikaela Smith  — will compete in the women’s 800m.
Hurdlers to look out for include sophomore Marquís Morris, who narrowly missed out on last weekend’s 60m HH finals, and freshman Graham, who placed seventh in the women’s 60m HH finals, which only included three college athletes. Iuel and freshman Lyndsey Lopes will join Graham in the 60m HH this weekend.
The Trojan long jumpers will comprise of Faulknor, Iuel and Margaux Jones for the women, while Jackson and Eric Sloan will represent the men. The high jump event will include one USC athlete: sophomore Randall Cunningham. The triple jump competition will feature Dominic Smallwood, who placed seventh last weekend, and Sloan, who jumped a personal best last weekend to claim first place in an impressive display of athleticism.
Last but not least, USC’s shot-putters will try to sweep the event once again. Last weekend redshirt sophomore Nick Ponzio and senior Tera Novy won the men’s and women’s events, respectively. Freshman Nathan Bultman managed a third place throw in the men’s event, while junior Tanya Sapa secured second place in the women’s with a personal best throw. Talented Freshman Matthew Katnik will compete alongside Ponzio and Bultman this weekend.
The Trojans have two more competitions left in this year’s indoor season: the MPSF Championships later in the month and the NCAA Indoor Championships in early March. These precede USC’s first outdoor competition in mid-March: the Trojan Invitational.

The No. 6 men’s tennis team is heading to Virginia over the weekend to play in the ITA National Team Indoor Championships in Charlottesville where they will face No. 13 University of South Florida.
At 5-0, the team is trying to stay unbeaten on the season.
“We are undefeated for the moment, we won five matches and two matches 4-3,” sophomore Thibault Forget said. “I think we have a pretty good confidence going on right now.”
The Trojans qualified for the championships after winning the kick-off event on Jan. 22-23 on the home courts of Marks Stadium with a 4-3 win over Tulane, thanks to a third-set comeback by Forget, who battled to win the set 6-4 after being down 4-2.
The team will have to adjust quickly to the indoor courts, as they have been practicing on outdoor courts so far.
“It’s going to be indoor but the courts are supposedly going to be pretty slow,” Forget said. “We’re practicing on short points, lot more drills that are one-two shots, trying to go to the net a lot because indoors is usually faster compared to outdoors.”
The Men of Troy have no doubles team ranked but can rely on four singles player among the top in the nation. At No. 41, junior Nick Crystal is currently 3-1 in the season, while at No. 69 and at No. 83 respectively, freshmen Logan Smith and Jake DeVine will try to remain undefeated, as they carry a 5-0 and 4-0 record. At No. 115 is senior Max de Vroome, with a 1-2 record overall.
“The first matches we played pretty good teams but now we are going to play against the top 16 teams in the country,” Forget said. “Obviously, we are expecting something different. The coaches are harder with us because we all know the level is going to be higher. There is obviously a lot more expectation but I think we are ready to play against these guys, and it’s going to be a great chance for the freshmen to know what it is to play against the best teams”
University of South Florida is currently 3-1 and has recently suffered its first loss to Texas A&M, after a close match that ended with the score of 4-3. The Bulls have no doubles team ranked nationally. In singles, sophomore Roberto Cid is ranked at No. 17 and is currently undefeated for this season.
If the fourth seed Trojans win Friday, they would play Saturday against the winner of the match between TCU and Illinois. The semifinals and final are scheduled on Sunday and Monday, respectively.
First serve Friday is at 12:30 P.M.

March on Trousdale was organized by USC’s Black Student Assembly on Wednesday as part of an event series occurring throughout February in honor of Black History Month. Commemorating Martin Luther King Jr.’s 1963 March on Washington, the march’s participants wore business casual and walked together in silence, emulating the historic demonstration that occurred 53 years ago.        As Amaka Agodi announced at the start of the march, the purpose for their procession was to call attention to the institutional oppression still in place for people of color, and to stand in solidarity with the Black Lives Matter movement.The students made and distributed signs with slogans such as “We still have a dream!” and “We march for black liberation.”The group carried these signs from the north end of campus from Gavin Herbert Plaza to Tommy Trojan, but first snaked along McClintock Avenue, Watt Way, and the Campus Center.
At the Steps of Troy, the group paused for four minutes of silence to pay tribute to victims of police brutality.Members of the Professional Community Intervention Training Institute, which works to train and certify gang and crisis interventionists, participated as well, having been at the original 1963 March on Washington.The march ended at the Tommy Trojan statue, where students had the opportunity to speak.The march concluded with participants singing in unison the lyrics to the Black National Anthem, “Lift every voice and sing.”

Do you believe in love at first sight? As a social experiment, The Daily Trojan Editorial Board set up two people on a blind date to see what would happen. To some, college is a time for experimenting and exploring options. For others, it’s the best time to go looking for their potential spouse. Blind dates are tricky — things can get messy if expectations aren’t clearly addressed or if there are no sparks in the beginning. There are always two sides to a story. Read on to find out what happened.
Him:
My Sunday began like any other. I woke up, came into the office and was fully prepared to kick back and watch the Super Bowl with my friends afterward. Somehow though, while I was at work, I ended up agreeing instead to get set up on a blind date and then write an article about the experience.
I thought to myself, “That’s no big deal, I can find some time to fit this into my schedule,” only to end up at Ground Zero at 10 p.m. later that night for the sake of this social experiment. To be honest, the whole scenario was kind of rushed in order to make things happen before the story’s Wednesday deadline. I had an interview beforehand and an essay to complete afterward, so everything had to be more truncated than I would normally do things.
I wasn’t given any details at all before I met her, and I didn’t even know what she looked like, which made finding her at Ground Zero at 10 o’clock at night a bit of a challenge. But on the flip side, at least I didn’t go into it with any preconceived notions about what she would be like.
Neither of us had thought about Ground Zero actually closing either, so when we both got there we had to meander around campus for a little bit before finally finding a Starbucks to sit down at and have a conversation.
Which is what I would refer to the night as more than anything else: a pleasant conversation, rather than a date. We ended up having a pretty good amount in common. We were both transfer students, were both very involved in a wide variety of organizations on campus and had pretty similar mentalities for approaching college as well as life. She even knew my roommate, and she almost texted him beforehand. But after walking down Figueroa before finally parting ways, I didn’t feel like a spark had generated. She was super nice, and it wasn’t the painfully awkward experience that most people think of when they hear the words “blind date,” but the whole thing just didn’t click for me.
At the end of the day, I think the problem with this whole experiment was that I went into this thing with the mindset that this was going to somehow have to turn into a story, and as a result I never took the “date” part of the equation very seriously. Even though this girl was pretty and nice, we obviously both had ulterior motives for being there other than legitimately trying to get to know each other.
Like most things, for a date to be successful both people have to want to make it work. Relationships take time, commitment and effort, and if that effort isn’t apparent, then what’s the point of even moving onward? I was mainly there because I had a job to do and I was less interested in forging an emotional connection, so it didn’t happen.
It also didn’t help that for most of the night, my mind was in “damage control” mode. Taking risks and leaps of faith have resulted in some of the most successful dates I’ve been on. But because any chance I took that didn’t pay off was going to be immortalized in print, I instead took the route of playing it as safe as possible. I wasn’t trying to make something happen, I was trying to get through the whole thing without embarrassing myself.
Overall, I would say that if someone asks you about going on a blind date or anything of that nature, think about why you want to be there. Don’t go because someone asks you, go because you want to, because at the end of the day that’s the only way that you will ever end up being successful.

Her:
My impression of a blind date has always been associated with women and men in their mid-30s who are so unlucky in finding a partner that their friends have to step up and coax. So when my friend presented me with this opportunity, I immediately doubted my charm, speculating why I would need a blind date at the age of 19. Regardless, I decided to give it a chance to see what it has to offer.
Hours before the date, which was scheduled to be at 10 p.m., my mind was imaginatively occupied by materialistic thoughts of my date, filtering through possible images of him characterized with idealistic traits. Could this be the day I find my future husband? I constantly reimagined my scenario to resemble that of a happily-ever-after ending of a soap opera, completely devoid of reality. After a few attempts of digging information about my date out of my friend, I realized the necessity of embracing the whole meaning behind a “blind date,” that it is the element of surprise that makes it concept to be so mysterious yet thrilling.
I provided a sufficient hour for myself to ensure I was presentable. After curling my short hair, applying a thick layer of false lashes and layering a rosy shade of blush and lipstick, I accentuated my effervescence through a sweet scent of Miss Dior perfume. After bombarding my room into a post-atomic horror through multiple fits of stylish outfit, I finally departed wearing an everyday outfit composed of a grey sweater and a pair of loose pants, reminding myself of the casualness of the date.
It was 9:55pm. Within the remaining five minutes, my heart rate quickened, creating a sense of exhilaration mixed with anxiety that quickly filled my lungs. I started running, as I was both slightly late and I wanted relief from the nervousness building up. It was then we crossed paths, with him catching me mid-air with my mouth open gasping for air, hair flowing free from gravity‘s restraint and eyes wide open as if I were being chased by a horde of zombies. And there, my first impression went right down the drain.
He said, breaking the silence, “Erika’s friend?”
“Yes! Hello,” I said, out of breath.
We then formally introduced each other. He had a distinctly strong and firm handshake, a little too much actually, which made me feel as if he was attempting to shake my hand off my shoulder.
Though we verbally exchanged names, I realized minutes later that I did not actually retain his name due to how nervous I was.
It turns out that the café we were supposed to have our date at was closed, so we decided to grab some coffee at the Starbucks on Figueroa Street. As we were walking in and out of the shades of street lights, I took discontinuous gazes at his features.
He was very tall and was wearing all black. His chiseled face defined by a slightly pointed chin and a sturdy jaw line. His light brown hair was complemented with a hint of curliness. His deep aqua blue eyes conveyed a sense of sincerity, sitting below his evenly trimmed eyebrows. He carried himself in steady footsteps and spoke in a very mature and steadfast way, exuding a sense of certitude that was palpable.
We made a stop at Starbucks, and with coffee in presence, we started talking about our favorite types of coffee, which then led to discussing about the necessity of coffee in our lives, as we found out that we are both very prone to going to sleep late and rising early due to our busy schedules.
We were both transfer students, with the same reasons for transferring, as we felt like we weren’t a good fit of the slow, peaceful locations of our first alma mater. We both wish to live in a fast-paced environment, with a passion to explore new environments. We talked about the places we went and recommended some to each other with reasons why we should explore there. Every once in a while I turn and made contact with his blue eyes as they gave off a sense of approval and genuineness. Deep inside those eyes I could sense a strong sense of idealism and individuality, a whole new realm I’m completely foreign to yet adored.
It was very interesting to compare his life with mine, with many similarities yet were contrasted by two different realms of study as he was a creative writer and I was a business student.
We ended our conversation upon finishing our coffees. I said my goodbyes with no romantic feelings attached whatsoever, but what I felt that I gained more from this experience than I expected. We often portray the end result of a date as either a success or a failure contingent on the ending relationship resulting between two people. But I realized it doesn’t have to be that way. We often go into a date knowing who the other person is and the exact traits and personality that we looked for, which were often the reasons that led to a date. But being on a blind date allows yourself to be exposed to unpredictable yet diverse sets of perspectives, allowing you to really open your eyes to see that there is far more just than checking off the “ideal personality and traits” list for compatibility. I am grateful to my friend for setting this date up to unblind me from my restricted ideal traits of a date, letting me realize that there is far more to explore, far more to learn about myself, and far more to putting on that extra blush to make myself more physically appealing.
Later that night, I was reminded of his name again and went to sleep soundly.

It’s that time of the year when couples are sickeningly cute and single people are just plain sick from eating a pint of ice cream alone while watching cheesy rom-coms. Glittery hearts and teddy bears are everywhere. Whether you’ll be going on a romantic date with your significant other or you’ll be attending KXSC’s “I’m Single and I Hate You” anti-Valentine’s Day party, chances are you’ve been in love at least once.
In the spirit of the pink-and-red debacle that is the lead-up to V-Day, I’ve decided to write about a feminist book that focuses on relationships. Sometimes, book recommendations come from unexpected sources. A year ago, my English Literature professor suggested I read Marjane Satrapi’s Embroideries following a conversation about how culture differences tends to complicate relationships. At the time, I was busy with midterms and forgot all about Embroideries until I came across it at Leavey last week, just in time for Valentine’s Day.
Embroideries is a short graphic novel revolving around the discussions of a group of Iranian women who are gathered for tea at the house of the matriarch of the family. Naturally, the discussion turns to love and the experiences each of the women has had with men.
Each of Satrapi’s characters comes to life through the stories they tell: from helping a friend perform white magic to convincing a boyfriend’s mother to let him marry her, to taking opium to give oneself the hooded look of ‘bedroom eyes’ to seduce a man. One woman tells the story of being forced to marry an army general half a decade older than her. Another tells the story of advising her friend to use a razor blade to fake her virginity – ironically, the newlywed ends up cutting her husband instead.
Satrapi’s graphic novel is unique because the characters discuss virginity and sex in unabashed terms, unrepentant under the regime of the ultra-conservative Iranian government, where women are forced to cover up by wearing the hijab or chador. Both are veils to preserve modesty, although while in Islam a woman should not be forced, things operate differently in Iran. In the Middle East in general, relationships are often frowned upon – but that doesn’t mean that they don’t happen, albeit in secret, which Satrapi capitalizes on.
One character extolls on the benefits of being a mistress rather than the wife: “To be the mistress of the married man is to have a better role. Do you realize? His dirty shirts, his disgusting underwear, his daily ironing, his bad breath […] well, all of that is his for his wife! When a married man comes to his mistress, he’s always bleached and ironed, his teeth sparkle, he’s in a good mood […] he is there to have a good time with you.”
Controversy? As proven by the quote above, Satrapi does it well. It’s even in the title of her book, which does not refer to thread and cloth, but rather to the practice of recreating physical virginity by sewing up the hymen.
I fell in love with Embroideries because Satrapi allows the reader a view into the realities of living in the Middle East, beyond what is shown in Western media. She demolishes the stereotype of the submissive Muslim woman while never explicitly stating her motives. Unapologetic, she uses the shock factor of frank sexcapades to drive home the message: despite the dominant narrative, whether Iranian or American or something else entirely, and whether you love V-Day or hate it, love and relationships are an inevitable part of life.
Gift this book to your loved one or pair it with a night of binge-reading Aziz Ansari’s Modern Love, because V-Day is all about “treating yo’self.”

Love is in the air once again as Valentine’s Day comes around the corner this Sunday. For some, it could be a day of celebration and indulgence with loved ones; for others, it could be a dismal reminder of their singleness.
With the recent revival of dating apps and websites, it is not uncommon to find other college students or millennials looking for ways to spice up their lives. Maybe it’s time for you to take that risk and open up a profile — you will be surprised to see that many others are also looking for a special someone just like you. Despite the challenges and dangers that online dating has been associated with, new dating apps have developed more secure technology to ensure the privacy and safety of participants.
In recent years, online dating has allowed people to meet potential love interests. Today, it is particularly difficult for people to date without meeting each other on social media. Falling in love with someone after bumping into them on Trousdale is not exactly a realistic scenario for many. With so many different dating services available in the market, here are five popular apps that will help you find your soulmate this Valentine’s Day.
Tinder
Tinder has been a groundbreaking force in the online dating world. Popular among many college students and millennials, the platform offers a simple solution to the complications of online dating profiles. In contrast to other dating apps, Tinder has abbreviated the process of dating through the creation of a simple design. Users simply create their profiles by adding a couple of photos of themselves, as well as a few short sentences or phrases about themselves. The function itself is simple — swipe left on a profile if you are not interested, or swipe right if you are. If you both swipe right, it’s a match.
Coffee Meets Bagel
Coffee Meets Bagel is an app that aims for quality over quantity. Many users have claimed that the app truly allowed them to develop connections and overlook the shallow aspects of online dating. Essentially, you are the “coffee” and every 24 hours, the app brings you a single “bagel.” The app personalizes the experience by curating a match based on mutual Facebook friends. Users have 24 hours to decide if they are interested in their “bagels.” If both parties express interest in one another, then the app will open a virtual chatroom for them to communicate or plan a date together.
Hitch
Hitch is an interactive dating app that involves both users and their friends in the process of matchmaking. Adopting the idea of “friends know you better than yourself,” Hitch allows your friends to act as cupids, or matchmakers. Once users log in with their Facebook accounts, they can set their friends up together. The app only shows a photo and a brief profile of the person the user gets matched with, as well as the mutual friend who matched both parties together. Once that happens, a chat is opened up where the two matched users can meet one another. If both are interested, then they have the option of sending a “Reveal Request” to learn more about their matches. This app is particularly interesting because it allows your friends to play a part in your dating experience. Whether you are looking to get matched or play matchmaker for your friends, Hitch offers a refreshing and fun experience for everybody involved.
Down
A serious relationship isn’t for everybody. If you’re looking for mostly fun, Down is the app for you. The process is quite simple; the app is linked to the user’s Facebook account. In the app, users have the opportunity to select which of their friends they would like to get “down” with. You can also select friends of friends until you match with any one of your selections. Afterwards, you have the option to meet, plan a date, or get “down” with your match.
Hinge
Hinge aims to connect users through mutual friends on Facebook. The dating app’s main purpose is to allow people to meet one another without the awkwardness of not knowing anything about each other. Like a conventional online dating service, Hinge allows users to enter their preferences, location, and age. However, Hinge’s greatest advantage is that its emphasis on mutual friends and interests means that each user is accountable for his or her behavior, given that both parties share friends.

Just last week, the Daily Trojan reported that Vice President for Student Affairs Ainsley Carry had begun holding regular office hours to facilitate conversations with any student who decides to come in and voice their concerns.
The announcement provides increased access to high-level administrators — a welcome development to break down the monolith that is “the administration” here at USC and to increase transparency between officials and students. And as Undergraduate Student Government elections come to a close Thursday, it’s important that the new USG president, vice president and Senate put transparency on the agenda to continue to improve access to the administration and the crucial conclusions often made behind closed doors.
Administrative transparency, while important on its own to establish trust with students, also plays an instrumental role in pushing other initiatives — many of which have historically failed in USG administrations past. Tuition freeze advocacy is an excellent example — though USG passed a college affordability resolution that advocated for a tuition freeze last semester, no such freeze materialized. Moreover, advocacy and awareness efforts are limited by a restricted understanding of the allocation of tuition — as student leaders told the Daily Trojan in November, the University’s confusing and vague financial reports provided an impetus to include an interactive tuition spending report in the resolution. From an advocacy standpoint, the undecipherable reports also likely provide little foundation from which to raise specific tuition concerns and make recommendations. And since the University has not worked to implement an outright tuition freeze, perhaps it is more prudent to start USG tuition advocacy with transparency — giving students the tools to understand where tuition goes and to better explain tuition hikes.
Transparency goes beyond tuition conversations. It’s hard to see how candidates that push strong positions on opaque administrative decisions — like divestment — can actually succeed with their proposals when the University’s investment decisions are nearly impossible to discern and available financial information is severely limited. And it’s difficult to push for initiatives such as improving health and nutrition on campus when dining halls still do not make nutrition information public. Opaqueness on the part of the administration has created a lack of student advocacy on issues like security, finances and privacy — essential conversations that students deserve to have a voice in and that other student governments across the country have participated in.
Carry’s new office hours will probably not enable all advocacy which appeared impossible beforehand — but the step is a commendable beginning to increasing transparency and frank communication which extends beyond Provost Michael Quick’s memorandums and issue-specific open forums. University administrators should seize this unique moment to continue to open dialogues with students about administrative decisions. This means expanding office hours to other administrators, like Quick, making an active effort to make these conversations honest and productive and providing students with more information about decisions that affect their education.
At the same time, of course, students can’t mistake conversations about improving student life for actual improvements to student life created by concrete policy changes. Hopefully, increasing avenues for conversation between students and administrators will also increase advocacy, but this will only occur if these hours are also used as a vehicle to maintain organizational accountability.
Luckily, upcoming presidential and vice presidential tickets both have transparency in mind, albeit in different ways — the Edwin-Austin platform focuses on transparency between students and student organizations, while the Henriquez-Pham platform concentrates on the USC administration. And though the Daily Trojan Editorial Board, of which I am a party to, recently endorsed the Edwin-Austin ticket, both of these goals are important to laying a groundwork to improve the efficiency of advocacy as a whole.
USG elections end Thursday, and soon Trojans will find out who will champion students’ interests among the administration. Let’s hope that our new leaders can provide a map to students on Trousdale Parkway to navigate the labyrinth of university officials in Bovard Auditorium just a few feet away.

A new initiative spearheaded by San Francisco Unified School District Superintendent Richard Carranza and the San Francisco Department of Public Health is slated to distribute free condoms to Bay Area middle school students. Reactions from concerned parents and the religious right not only reflect a national aversion to sex education but also question the effectiveness of handing out condoms. Ultimately, schools must go past offering free contraception and take a more active and nuanced role in fostering sex-positive relationships.
It is already common knowledge that abstinence-only sex education is detrimental to communities and young adults’ ideas of healthy sexual relationships. But when SFUSD proposes going one step further by letting students access condoms, old fears rise up again. As one parent said, “[it] would be a distraction and [it’s] not the teacher’s job.”
Interestingly enough, one country has made this type of curriculum part of teachers’ pedagogical duties at all grade levels. In the Netherlands, where the teen pregnancy rate is five times lower than that in the United States, sex education starts as early as kindergarten, and students learn about birth control around age 11. The difference is that their model puts discussions of intimacy and bodily safety first — a far cry from the cold, clinical lessons featuring anatomical cross-sections here in the United States. Without mention of sexual pleasure, the importance of consent and the destigmatization of sex, the current model of U.S. sex education is incomplete. SFUSD has developed plans for open discussions, providing instructional pamphlets as well as a required meeting with a nurse or social worker — however, one meeting isn’t enough to foster sexual positivity that should theoretically span across years of education.
According to the district, around 5.2 percent of middle schoolers are sexually active. Some parents might find this low percentage a case against radical sex education and the availability of condoms to students who won’t use or need them. However, the measures taken by SFUSD and other school districts are not simply meant for immediate results; international studies show that comprehensive sex education at a young age has far-reaching effects, such as increases in self-esteem, communication and a decrease in the likelihood of rape. In addition, the program ensures confidentiality except in cases of abuse, where Child Protective Services will be alerted; this safety measure can be instrumental for a student, particularly when his or her parents are against comprehensive sex education. Despite the fact that a middle schooler might not use one, a condom could serve as an icebreaker for the ongoing conversation on positive sex relations that will last throughout a student’s lifetime, and the candid talk with a school nurse is just the beginning of his or her preparation for adulthood.
Another widely successful contraception program can serve as a good example; in a six-year experiment in Colorado where teens and impoverished women were offered a variety of free birth control methods, teen birth rates dropped by 40 percent and abortions dropped by 42 percent. This longitudinal study found a strong positive correlation between unwanted pregnancies, sparse access to sex education and high poverty rates. With an average poverty rate of 11.3 percent — compared to the national average of 15.9 percent — San Francisco and its middle schools are no exception to this rule. It is therefore integral that students — socioeconomically disadvantaged ones in particular — receive a quality sex education and exposure to contraceptive methods to spread knowledge and help break the cycle of poverty.
The bottom line is that students, especially those in need, require a stable presence of resources, including those related to sexual health that have had measurable positive results. However, as long as condoms maintain their current taboo status, students’ future sexual relationships may be colored with shame, creating unhealthy interactions. If sex education is reformed to be less sterile and more about communication between partners, these programs are more likely to have successful, future-oriented results.

Four months ago, Bernie Sanders was not a member of the Democratic Party. Today, he stands on the heels of his victory in New Hampshire and has cut Hillary Clinton’s national lead to only 7 points from a seemingly insurmountable 35 point lead in the summer. But Sanders still lacks the support of the Democratic establishment; he has yet to connect with minority communities and Clinton trounces him in the 45-and-above demographic.  The catalyst of Sanders’ success, like Barack Obama before him, is his popularity among young voters. Sanders’ platform of rigorous economic and health care reform aims to eliminate systemic ineffectiveness and injustice, making him the ideal candidate for millennial voters.
A central theme of Sanders’ campaign is corporate corruption — and rightly so. In 2008, the American economy was destroyed by the collective greed of Wall Street bankers who made billions before breaking the economy. Taxpayers paid billions to bail them out, and shareholders paid nearly $190 million in fines. Eight million Americans lost their jobs, 4 million lost their homes, and for all that, only one banker was jailed. Millions of millennials suffered the repercussions of the financial collapse; they watched their parents struggle and fail to pay bills, and their childhoods were disrupted when they were kicked out of their homes.
Wall Street’s big banks are larger now than before the Great Recession, and Sanders is the only candidate willing to break them up. The GOP, with millions of dollars from Wall Street donations, seeks to deregulate the financial sector, and Clinton, though more progressive than the Republicans, also refuses to break up the big banks, although she claims that she will regulate Wall Street. Major financial reform passed in the Dodd-Frank Act of 2010, but since then, according to The Nation, Wall Street has spent a billion dollars lobbying to undo the most vital regulations within the bill.
Sanders’s plan to end too-big-to-fail banks is the responsible choice for the American economy, as too-big-to-fail banks only become more dangerous over time. They use their immense lobbying power to destroy the regulations that keep them in check, ultimately undoing whatever restrictions were put upon them. There is no such thing as a “safe” too-big-to-fail bank, which no other candidate recognizes. Beyond economic reform, Sanders’ health care plan also sets him apart from other candidates.
Sanders, like most Americans, supports a universal health care system, a prime solution for millennials who will soon face the pressures of rising health care costs. This is no pipe dream or promise of a reality-denying socialist; this is a fact seen in numerous countries with far superior health care systems, including England and France. According to Sanders, implementing such a system would save $6 trillion over 10 years compared to the current health care system. Clinton supported such a system in 2008, but changed her tune after receiving over $13 million in donations from the health care industry. Whether this is taken as corruption or a lack of courage, Clinton fails to pursue what the American people both desire and deserve. At best, she is too cautious to break from the status quo, but that status quo — one of ineffectiveness and inefficiency — is exactly what millennials want to leave behind.
Describing Clinton’s stances as merely pragmatic also ignores the close relationship she has developed with both the health care and financial sectors. Beside the millions of dollars she received from the health care sector, she also received millions of dollars in both speaking fees and donations from Wall Street groups. Put simply, Wall Street would not give millions of dollars to a candidate whose policies would damage their profits. Given that Wall Street’s irresponsible behavior led to billions of dollars in profit, reining in the financial sector will necessarily bite into their profits. Entrusting Clinton with reining in Wall Street, then, is foolish.
Clinton represents the Democratic establishment, but it is Sanders whose ideals and proposals are in line with the values of millennial voters. Clinton’s campaign may look revolutionary in comparison to GOP candidates, but Sanders’ dedication to progressive values shows the many areas in which she lacks. His goals are undoubtably lofty, but all great political accomplishments began with great struggle. Apathy toward injustice is tacit approval, and it is unjust to abandon a movement — whether that be health care reform, economic inequality or any other issue — because of its inherent difficulties. Creating a fair economy and an affordable health care system should be no difficulty compared to America’s past challenges, and it is up to Sanders and his millennial backers to move America toward that path of progress.

Amanda Curtis | Daily Trojan
Black History Month is upon us once again — a time that allows us all to celebrate the culture that African Americans have contributed to this nation. One of the most notable contributions from African Americans to American pop culture is music, which has helped to define every generation since the birth of the nation. African-American musicians have been pioneers in nearly every genre you can think of, and it’s important to celebrate their work and give it the proper respect it deserves.
The ’50s and ’60s: Evolution of rock ‘n’ roll, R&B and soul 
Back in the ’50s, as a result of black artists mixing the blues and gospel church music together, African Americans swept the nation with the birth of rock ‘n’ roll. The wail of the blues could be heard in the loud and exciting sound of artists like Little Richard, artists like Chuck Berry utilized the uplifting spirit of gospel to influence their sound and the call and response and backing of background singers in gospel influenced doo-wop — another popular form of rock ‘n’ roll. Doo-wop is what most people think of when they think of ’50s music, and with good reason, since it has a characteristic cheerful and bubblegum pop sound to it.
From rock ‘n’ roll, black musicians started to take a detour. There were still hard rockers who adapted to the change to psychedelic rock, like Jimi Hendrix, but doo-wop went on to evolve into R&B and soul music. Two conglomerates heavily dominated black music at this time: Stax Records, located in Memphis, and Motown Records, located in my hometown, Detroit.  Stax Records had a more soulful sound, more akin to a bluesy sound, while the Motown sound begged the listener get out of their seat and dance, and with a lineup like The Temptations, Marvin Gaye, The Supremes and The Jackson Five, it’s impossible not to dance when hearing the happy vocals of these artists. Motown and Stax Records found the key to what the American people wanted in music. Stax Records appealed to the crowd that wanted more depth in their tracks, while Motown found its crowd in the mainstream. While they were different in nature, they both came to influence one of the most controversial decades in black music history.
The ’70s: Advent of disco and hip-hop 
The ’70s gave rise to disco, which was met with love and hate from fellow musicians and listeners alike. Disco music is long and repetitive, created for the sole purpose of making people dance. Some black artists, like Diana Ross, Donna Summer and even Michael Jackson, embraced the disco era and produced disco classics. Like I said before, it’s long and repetitive, and after countless car rides with my dad playing songs from his personal collection, it’s hard to tell where one song ends and a different begins.
Black artists who went against the grain continued down the soul route, and many black artists, such as Isaac Hayes, Marvin Gaye, The Spinners and countless others, further delved into their black identity and did wonders for the genre of soul. There are many gems from this era that are often overlooked because of disco, but it’s incredible to see what sorts of sounds were coming from these black artists. For example, Roy Ayers would soon become one of the most sampled artists by rappers and hip hop groups to come, while The Delfonics explored bigger sounds with their full orchestra in the classic song “Didn’t I (Blow Your Mind This Time).”
After soul had its day in the sun, hip-hop came for its time in the spotlight. Hip-hop is especially important in the history of black music, because black music became the forefront and widely accepted mainstream of America. In the ’80s, hip-hop was more tame and playful; Grandmaster Flash and the Furious Five, Run DMC, Kurtis Blow and others introduced this brand new art form to America. Sampling, intricate rhyme schemes and good, clean fun gave listeners an insight into the talents of black musicians.
The ’80s and ’90s: Rap rules 
’80s rap was tame for the most part, but late-’80s and ’90s rap gave rise to a more realistic, aggressive and socially conscious style called gangsta rap. Gangsta rap is a staple for black musicians, as it allows them to vent their frustrations and educate their listeners on the bleak realities of the struggles that they must go through as African-Americans. NWA spoke out about police brutality, Notorious B.I.G. spoke about what it was like to grind before his rise to fame and Nas paints an accurate picture of what growing up in the ghettos of New York is like, which isn’t pretty, to say the least. It wasn’t all bad, however, as rappers also kept the spirit of having fun in black music alive; The Pharcyde told a great and all too relatable story of unrequited love, Snoop Dogg told you about what he likes to sip on from time to time and Ice Cube described a pretty good day (it’s supposedly January 20, 1992).
Black musicians now are still making strides in almost every genre of music. Doo-wop, soul and disco are still being made, believe it or not. Hip-hop remains a large part of mainstream culture in America. R&B is still as prominent today as it was in the Motown days. Most importantly, black musicians are still inventing new sounds that will inevitably become the next big thing in music, while still paying homage to the great black musicians that came before them. Black artists have given so much to music over the years. This month, let’s celebrate their contributions.

USC athletic director Pat Haden suffered another health scare Wednesday when he collapsed on campus – Carlo Acenas | Daily Trojan
USC Athletic Director Pat Haden collapsed Wednesday morning outside Heritage Hall and was taken away in an ambulance to receive medical attention off campus, according to a statement from USC Athletics.
Haden was walking back from a meeting on campus when he felt lightheaded and sat down outside Heritage Hall, at which time the athletic department’s medical staff tended to him.
Haden was able to walk to his office in Heritage Hall under his own power and was alert and talking during the entire process. He was then transported to his doctor off campus.
In an updated statement Wednesday evening, the Athletics department said that Haden was at a local hospital, “resting comfortably” and in stable condition.
“He plans to be back soon watching his Trojans in action,” the statement read. “He thanks all for their concern.” 
In a tweet, Haden reassured fans and thanked USC director of athletic medicine and head athletic trainer Russ Romano. 
“Thanks for all the good wishes,” Haden said. “[Thanks] to Russ Romano and the USC docs! Hope to [be] home soon. Fight On!!”
The Los Angeles Times reports that Haden will undergo a medical procedure “in the next few days.” 
According to the statement, the incident was very similar to the one Haden experienced at the Notre Dame football game in October. While observing warm-ups, Haden reported feeling lightheaded and went down onto one knee. After a period of brief hospitalization, Haden was allowed to fly home.
The 63-year-old Haden has served as athletic director since 2010, but announced last week that he would retire from the post at the end of June. He will remain at the school until 2017 to guide the renovation of the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum.  
Haden’s tenure at USC has had its highs and lows, with the football program going through multiple coaching changes, most recently the Steve Sarkisian controversy that saw Haden fire the embattled ex-coach after Sarkisian’s noted issues with alcoholism. Haden also infamously terminated Lane Kiffin in 2013 and was fined $25,000 after a game in 2014 when he went down to the sideline and argued with the officials. 
Haden, who has a pacemaker, has been dealing with health concerns in recent months. Following the scare at Notre Dame, he resigned from the College Football Playoff selection committee because of the travel load and did not attend seven of USC’s final eight football games. 
“I haven’t been 100 percent, but I feel perfectly fine now,’’ Haden said to 710-AM radio last Friday regarding his health. “I could have done this for a lot more years. I just turned 63. My father died at a young age but I’m hoping to live a long, healthy life from here and spend time with my seven grandsons.”
