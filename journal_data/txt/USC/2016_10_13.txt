For 12 years, Nathalie Gosset worked for USC’s Alfred E. Mann Institute for Biomedical Engineering, most recently as a senior director of marketing and technology innovation evaluation. When she was fired in October 2015, she spoke up about a string of abuse that she said had been going on almost as long as she had been working there.
Photo courtesy of the American Association of University Women Legal Action FundApproaching arbitration · Nathalie Gosset worked at the Alfred E. Mann Institute until October 2015, when she was fired by the University.
“I can tell you I got traumatized by the environment and by [my boss],” Gosset said. “I still have strong difficulties to even drive around USC — I have traumatic reactions [and] fear.”
Gosset has filed an arbitration demand against the University claiming that her employment was wrongfully terminated after she reported being sexually harassed by her boss, the executive director of the institute. She initially filed a lawsuit against her former boss and the Alfred Mann Institute on Feb. 23.
“He used a lot of sexual terms and imagery in meetings and in one-on-one conversations with me,” Gosset said. “He did not touch me, but the verbal and sexual conversation ended up being strong, severe bullying.”
The arbitration demand was filed against Gosset’s former boss, the Alfred Mann Institute’s head of human resources, the institute and USC.
USC has since released a statement from Kelly Bendell, the University’s associate general counsel of litigation.
“The allegations in the case of Nathalie Gosset are without merit. The university will defend itself and those named in the suit vigorously,” the statement said.
Gosset said the harassment started soon after he joined the institute, and that while she attempted to mention it to the human resources department several times, she was disregarded.
In February 2015, Gosset finally reported a verbal attack in her boss’ office “that was extremely inappropriate and very upsetting,” she said.
The suit states that the executive director supposedly became annoyed with Gosset during a seminar when he was presenting a product idea to the senior management team in the room and she “stepped in to facilitate the questions and answers as she was tasked to do.” After the meeting, the document states, her boss leaned in toward her “in a menacing fashion” and allegedly said, “‘Your intervention in the meeting was blocking me from having an intellectual orgasm. You should be quiet, let me do my thing, and go and take a shower afterward.’”
The document also mentions that when Gosset reported his conduct to an HR representative, the representative responded that “her reaction was the result of a fictional annoyance toward the speaker at the seminar” and “abused Gosset with a campaign of disdain and adverse employment action.”
In an HR meeting following the incident, the executive director allegedly said that he could not guarantee that he would be able to contain his “sexually bullying behavior because the bully was in his blood,” according to the document.
Gosset said that for months after the HR meeting, her boss treated her coldly and refused to speak to her, impairing Gosset’s ability to do her job. When Gosset talked to the HR representative about the rough treatment and distant behavior, the representative allegedly said that her worries were projections of “unresolved father-daughter issues,” which she needed to sort out.
In October 2015, Gosset was relieved of her position.
“I was presented termination papers on the grounds that my job function was eliminated,” Gosset said.
Gosset’s lawyer, Lisa Bloom, has built her case on the grounds that USC failed to adequately handle a sexual harassment complaint.
“We allege that USC failed to comply with its own written policy, because when Nathalie complained about being sexually harassed by her boss, USC failed to investigate [and] failed to protect her,” Bloom said. “In USC’s written policy about sexual harassment, it says that USC is supposed to do a prompt, thorough investigation within 60 days -— well, 60 days came and went; they didn’t do anything, [and] Nathalie got fired.”
Bloom said that they wrote a letter after Gosset retained Bloom and her law firm, but USC still failed to investigate the matter.
“They did nothing but delay and delay, told us they had other priorities and [said that] they just couldn’t get around to Nathalie Gosset who they had terminated,” Bloom said. “We then sued them, and only then did they claim to do an investigation. Of course they found that nobody did anything wrong, even though in their investigation they failed to even interview Nathalie Gosset, the complainant.”
Bloom hopes for a multimillion dollar compensation for Gosset, or at least an amount based on Gosset’s lost earnings, lost benefits and “substantial emotional distress.”
“This should be something that’s very significant and should require USC, when it gets a complaint like this, to take it very seriously,” Bloom said. “[USC needs] to make women’s careers a priority, and to stop telling women that these issues are not important, [that] everything else is going to come first, and ‘We’ll get around to it when we get around to it.’”
The case will be heard in court in June of next year.

The other day I found myself re-watching How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days. Andie (Kate Hudson), a journalist at a popular women’s magazine, is inspired by her gal pal’s recent break-up and uses frequent habits that her friends often engage in that ultimately destroy relationships. She works her ass off to get a guy and then makes him lose all interest in her within 10 days, all as part of research for her article.
This got me thinking. Andie’s gal pal was depicted as needy, overbearing and too emotional in all her relationships — all behaviors that are negatively associated with women. So in what ways have I picked up habits that society and rom-coms at large portray as “unattractive” to the past men I have dated?
So here, today, I present to you five (absolutely ridiculous) ways that I have seen myself and other lady friends so inconsiderately “disservice” men in our past relationships.
1. Not letting them feel useful.
Apparently, I have this “issue” where I’m really competent and like to take care of things by myself. So when it came to a guy I was dating, he often felt left out of the picture. Things like carrying groceries into my apartment, helping me with my homework or creating my five-year-plan, I had it all covered. I could physically see his muscles deflate little by little each time I opened my own jars. He would communicate with me how he felt that he was on standby but wanted me to let him “take care of me” a little more. Sadly, I was not willing to become a less independent version of myself, so, evidently, the guy didn’t stay for very long.
2. Not caring about their opinions on your appearance.
On the daily, I can range from New York Fashion Week to Idaho’s award-losing potato sack. One of my dudes wasn’t really for it. I recall one time we were going out to dinner and I decided to pair my little black dress with some all-white, All Star Adidas tennis shoes. He thought that I should pair it with something like heels or a pair of cute woven flats. Note taken, but I think he forgot to realize that I dress for myself. Dude was sad I didn’t take his opinion on being his trophy girl.
3.  Being knowledgeable on things that aren’t “meant for” girls.
I am a Lakers fan. All day. But, come into any conversation with a male fellow and sharing the fact of my undying love for the Lakers, I am immediately quizzed on trivial things like, “Oh, so who’s the starting five for the upcoming season?” or “Do you even know the blood type of the assistant coach whose last name starts with an M?” And don’t get me started on cars. I don’t even know how to put into words how pleasantly surprised guys are when they find out I can drive a manual car or if I can identify the difference between the exhaust sounds of a Honda versus a Nissan. But in any circumstance that a girl may happen to be more knowledgeable in discussions that are “for men,” it seems that such girls go from “cool, different and sexy” to “know-it-all, try-hard and aggravating.” So I guess if you’re trying to keep a guy, keep those men-terests to yourself.
4. Having a voice or being outspoken.
Ladies, if you thought being able to speak your mind and sharing your thoughts was a great way to express yourself, I am here today to correct you. I can’t count how many guys I have turned off by sharing my thoughts or being honest. My ex-boyfriend hated when I would object or question his personal thoughts or opinions. But my ex-boyfriend is not alone. Multitudes of male peers, even at USC, have a hard time listening to what women have to say; the fact that women have original thoughts and opinions is absurdly appalling! So next time you’re preparing for a date, make sure to put on extra extra lip gloss to keep your lips stuck together.
5. Being lactose intolerant.
Ah, the beauty of romance. To affirm a guy in his knowledge of women and how to swoon one, be sure to accept all his sweeping gestures and romantic efforts to make you go heart eyes. In the case that you may be romantically lactose intolerant, aka incapable of processing anything “cheesy,” just sit on your hands and bite your tongue! Let your guy love you the way that he believes you should be loved!.Forget about what you like, so long as he feels that his idea of romance is being properly portrayed — that’s what a relationship should really be about. If you happen to start feeling your inner frustrations boiling inside of you just think of cute puppies and how this guy would look like with no eyebrows, then release a gentle, “Awww!”
There you have it: five ways I have lost a man. But in all seriousness, date how you want. Maybe you’re like Andie’s gal pal but maybe you can relate with the things I listed above. Either way, be true to you and find someone who is absolutely in love with it and embraces it all. Cheers and happy dating!

Maybe the reason why women like you lose guys is simply because guys do a Cost Benefit Analysis and simply conclude that, given your propensity for stereotyping men (while being against the same when its women) and lecturing people of their “privileges”, you are not worth the hassle.
I know of no man who honestly will dump a girl for voicing her opinions or dressing for herself (and I know of no women who would dump men for voicing their opinions or dressing for themselves). People who do so are not people you want to be associated with (both men and women), and you should avoid them.
Singling out one gender and fueling gender wars do not help anyone.

Emily Smith | Daily TrojanPop performance · First-year students at the Thornton School of Music’s pop music program performed live at Ground Zero for their midterm. Families and friends of students were invited to the special showcase.
Making her way to the center of the stage, sophomore Elshaddai Mulugeta could only see the lights from the rafters shining in her eyes. As she squinted, faces of family members and friends came into focus.
After several weeks of memorizing lyrics, running scales and rehearsing, it was time to perform. Except this wasn’t just any performance — it was her midterm.
On Wednesday, Mulugeta and the rest of USC’s first-year pop music students performed at Ground Zero Performance Cafe. The seventh annual Pop Music First Year Showcase was hosted by the Thornton School of Music and led by professor Andy Abad and program chair Patrice Rushen.
The popular music program encompasses different genres such as rock, pop, R&B, folk, Latin and country music. Described as “the cutting-edge department that’s become the site of one of Los Angeles’ most productive new music scenes” by Rolling Stone, the program helps students master and understand music beyond the traditional offerings of other university music programs.
In the popular music program, students collaborate in small groups and learn skills such as songwriting and arranging, music production and performance. On Wednesday, the students’ performances determined their midterm scores.
The performances began at 8 p.m. Ten minutes before the performance, the entire cafe was packed with students and community members. Because there were no seats left, people flocked to the front of the stage, ready to support the talented group of students.
On the small stage in Ground Zero, four bands composed of students in the program took turns performing different pieces of upbeat and passionate songs they had previously practiced in class. Each band performed four songs, with a new lead singer every time.
Each performer flaunted their abilities, whether it was in singing, playing the guitar, drums or other instruments. Each band put their own spin on classic songs like “Hit the Road, Jack,” “Only You” and “Tutti Frutti” using their unique vocals. Soon, many in the audience were on their feet, swaying and clapping along to the beat.
Though the performances were impressive, the process to achieve this level of skill was not easy. According to Abad,  a contemporary music professor, students received three songs to practice and perfect each week. Students consistently practiced, performed and received feedback before the showcase, where they would perform their final work.
The showcase was their first major performance, and as Abad mentioned, a major obstacle to overcome for the student musicians at the event.
Though performing is hard work, pop music students thoroughly enjoyed the process. This program helped students discover and establish their love for music and performance.
Elshaddai Mulugeta, a sophomore majoring in communication and popular music, said the unique format of the class gave her hands-on knowledge of the music industry.
“It’s crazy to be part of this,” Mulugeta said. “It’s cool that our midterms are performances.”
As someone who always wanted to pursue music, Mulugeta pursued the pop music program in addition to studying communication a year after coming to USC. In this class, Mulugeta stuck through the rigorous three songs-per-week routine, progressively polishing her skills.
Her hard work paid off. At the showcase, Mulugeta and the rest of her class belted out powerful melodies and instrumentals while the crowd cheered for them.
“The energy was so surreal — today was definitely a good day,” Mulugeta said. “If you follow your passions, you never know where they can lead you.”

Almost three years after the release of the revolutionary double album The 20/20 Experience, Justin Timberlake returned with a concert documentary film showcasing the world tour in support of his album. The film, titled Justin Timberlake + The Tennessee Kids, premiered on Netflix on Oct. 12.
The documentary began with Timberlake and his bandmates preparing for the final tour stop in Las Vegas. The opening scenes showed the group’s preparation, and it intimately followed each member of the band readying themselves for what would be the last time they performed together. While the film was undoubtedly a showcase of Timberlake’s unparalleled talents, it also showed the individual contributions of every performer that made the tour possible.
Photo courtesy of NetflixBringing sexy back · Justin Timberlake received praise for his third studio album The 20/20 Experience. In early 2015, director Jonathan Demme filmed the final two nights of Timberlake’s concert tour in Las Vegas.
The set opened with “Pusher Love Girl,” the opening track of 20/20. Timberlake shone throughout the song. He was undeniably in his element, and the camera work paralleled his swagger with swift and smooth visuals. Jonathan Demme, the film’s director, recorded the concert with ease, never putting style over substance. Instead, he allowed Timberlake and the Tennessee Kids to wow the audience with their musical skills.
Unlike several other modern concert films, like Taylor Swift’s The 1989 World Tour LIVE or Justin Bieber’s Believe, Justin Timberlake + The Tennessee Kids did not rely on flashy visuals and excessive edits. Instead, Demme flaunted the performers’ raw talents by filming in a raw, documentary-style manner.
After “Pusher Love Girl,” Timberlake took the audience into the past with a few of his older songs. Included in the setlist were fan favorites “Rock Your Body” and “LoveStoned.” The most fascinating part of each song was that Timberlake used his old-fashioned style and talent to astonish the audience.
Not only did Timberlake include a diverse setlist, with songs from his latest and oldest records, but he also covered a fair amount of songs. Most notable were Michael Jackson’s “Human Nature” and Bell Biv DeVoe’s “Poison.” With “Human Nature,” Timberlake strummed the guitar and slowed down the heavily energetic show.  “Poison” came not long after, and featured some of Timberlake’s best dance moves.
After “Poison,” Timberlake and company closed the show with a trio of his biggest hits: “Suit & Tie,” “SexyBack” and “Mirrors.” While “SexyBack” was forgettable when sandwiched between two recent hits, it was still a great performance. With “Mirrors,” however, Timberlake reached a new peak. He barely had to sing it at this point, with the audience taking over several times. Timberlake seemed emotional at this point, as he knew it would be the end of an era. With the finale, though, he left his audience with thousands of smiles on their faces.
Throughout the concert, Timberlake and his entourage were constantly shown smiling at each other in between singing lines, laughing at each other’s crazy dance moves and applauding each other’s riffs. To say that the group was comfortable with one another is an understatement — it was clear that they were a family, and the love they shared on stage was tangible. These emotions could be felt both on the screen and at the show.
While the film was advertised as a documentary with a decent amount of behind the scenes footage, there were only a few minutes in the beginning and closing moments of the film. This, however, did not take away from the film, as the concert itself was a treat.
With Jonathan Demme’s organic and unprocessed direction, Justin Timberlake + The Tennessee Kids captured the joy and essence of the concert. The documentary, while nostalgic, will excite Timberlake fans as they anticipate the release of his upcoming studio album.

If USC somehow makes it back to the Pac-12 Championship this season, it should thank redshirt freshman quarterback Sam Darnold, but a special shout-out should go to the unimaginable craziness that is the Pac-12.
Benjamin Dunn | Daily TrojanMan of many talents · Junior cornerback, kick returner and wide receiver Adoree’ Jackson is one yard away from breaking the USC record for career kick return yards. Jackson currently has 1,723 yards.
There is a reason why the hashtag #Pac12AfterDark trends on Twitter during every Pac-12 night game. Whether it’s officials blowing calls, weird plays happening on the field, Hail Marys (cue the way-too-soon mention of the “Jael Mary”), crazy overtime endings or games dragging on deep into the night, #Pac12AfterDark is the perfect summary of the inexplicable that seems to occur out West on Saturday nights.
It is this unpredictability of the Pac-12 that gives USC the slightest of hopes of making it to the Rose Bowl — a hope that would have been laughable three weeks ago when the Trojans were 1-3, reeling after a deflating loss to Utah and breaking in a redshirt freshman as their new quarterback.
Every team in the Pac-12 South already has a division loss. No. 21 Utah fell to unranked Cal two weeks ago. UCLA has not looked like itself and quarterback Josh Rosen may miss some time. USC… Well, we already know the deal. Arizona — typically annual contenders — does not even have a conference win yet. And to top it all off, Colorado, a team that won a total of one conference game last season, is tied for first in the South heading into week seven.
That is the state of the Pac-12 these days, and we haven’t even gotten to what’s happening up north (what is happening to Stanford? And the Huskies? Really?). Simply by winning their last two conference games to get back to .500 in the division, the Trojans sit just a half game back of first in the Pac-12 South, and their odds are looking surprisingly optimistic. They own the tiebreaker on two of the three frontrunners — Colorado and Arizona State — having beaten both of them, and have upcoming games against UCLA and Arizona, the two teams below them in the standings.
That leaves Utah as the biggest roadblock to the path to the Pac-12 Championship Game. Had the Trojans not collapsed in the second half against the Utes last month, they would be 3-1 in conference play and alone in first by now. But now, Utah is in front and owns the tiebreaker, so it would need to go 3-3 the rest of the way while USC would only be able to afford one more conference loss.
The second part of that hypothetical is key — there is no point in thinking of “what ifs” if USC doesn’t take care of business against weaker opponents. I wrote before the Arizona State game that the Trojans have to go 5-0 in their next five games leading up to the road tilt against No. 5 Washington next month to even give themselves a chance in the division. That would give them a 5-2 conference record and put them in position to potentially finish either 6-3 or 7-2; both records should be good enough to fight for first.
USC’s remaining conference schedule is favorable. Aside from Washington, there are no more Alabama-like monsters to conquer. Arizona is battered up, Cal’s defense is horrific, Oregon gave up 70 points last week and UCLA is beatable.
Win all of those games, and the Trojans have a shot. But the problem with an 0-2 conference start is their fate relies on the teams ahead of them losing. Assuming a defeat to Washington, USC needs both Colorado and Arizona State to lose twice more and Utah to lose three more times.
The Buffaloes and Sun Devils play each other Saturday, and each has at least one potential loss down the line in its schedule, so Utah remains the biggest concern. Between matchups against UCLA, Washington, Arizona State and Colorado, there is a chance of three more defeats for the Utes.
It’s fruitless, though, to talk about what could be if USC lays an egg tomorrow in Arizona, is upset by Cal or Oregon, or can’t get past that other L.A. school. On the other hand, the fact that we are discussing Pac-12 Championship possibilities rather than who the next head coach should be is a step in the right direction.
You can chalk it up to parity, or to top talent dispersing equally among relatively close schools for the Pac-12 essentially beating up on itself. Some coaches complain that the records reflect poorly on the conference and will prevent it from sending a team to the playoff, a complaint USC should not have at the moment. For a program looking to re-assert itself, a conference championship followed by a Rose Bowl appearance would do the trick.
To be realistic, this is a long shot. ESPN’s Football Power Index gives USC a mere 4.6 percent chance of winning the Pac-12, and it has a far greater chance of an appearance in the Foster Farms Bowl than the Rose Bowl. But as long as the door is still open just a crack — however small it is — the Trojans should thank #Pac12AfterDark and charge straight ahead.

Trevor Sochocki | Daily TrojanStop the ball · The USC defense held their past two opponents, ASU and Colorado, to their lowest scoring performances of the season. This week, the defense is facing the second best quarterback rush in the country.
On the 100th anniversary of the first time the Trojans and the Arizona Wildcats met, USC will head to Tucson for their sole road game in October.
The Trojans (3-3, 2-2) are coming off of two consecutive wins at the Coliseum, including last week when they hung on to beat Colorado, 21-17. The Wildcats (2-4, 0-3) are looking for their first win in Pac-12 South play. Last week, Arizona lost on the road against Utah, 36-23.
Even though the Trojans are favored, each of the last nine meetings between these two teams have been decided by eight points or fewer.
Similar to last week when the Trojans prepared one defensive game plan despite not knowing who the starting quarterback would be, Arizona hasn’t announced their starter.
Redshirt sophomore quarterback Brandon Dawkins is still under concussion protocol. Dawkins is the team leader in total touchdowns, total points scored, rushing yards, passing yards and passing touchdowns. Replacing him last week was freshman Khalil Tate, a graduate of Junipero Serra High School who grew up in Inglewood, Calif.
“Once he’s got the ball in his hands, it’s hard to get him down,” junior three-way player Adoree’ Jackson said of his former high school teammate. “One of those things where he’s electrifying with the ball, he can beat you with his arm and beat you with his feet. A special kid.”
With their inconsistent quarterback situation, the Wildcats rank tenth in Pac-12 in passing offense, but they are third in rushing offense, averaging 226.80 yards per game. Arizona’s quarterback rushing is second to only Louisville, however.
The past two weeks, USC’s defense has held ASU and Colorado to their lowest scoring games of the season.
The Trojans are still looking for their first road win this season, and they will most likely be without their starting running back senior Justin Davis, who is suffering from a sprained ankle. Picking up the slack will be sophomore running backs Ronald Jones II and Aca’Cedric Ware. Both backs have rushed for one touchdown.
The Trojans will also look to their new offensive leader in redshirt quarterback Sam Darnold. Darnold is eighth in the country in passer rating and first among freshmen.
An offensive key for USC is improving on their third down conversion percentage.
“I think it’s going to be critical this week to be able to keep a team that can get 90 to 100 plays,” head coach Clay Helton said.
In order to help keep the defense rested, the special teams unit will be called upon to make an impact on the game. Arizona’s kickoff coverage ranks last in the conference, which provides Jackson with a huge chance to make the explosive plays for which he is known.
“I know at the end of the day some teams that have had troubles on special teams, when they go against someone who can change the game, they seem to figure it out and get it together,” Jackson said. “So it’s just me trying to make the most of my opportunities.”
Jackson needs just one kickoff return yard to break the tie for USC’s all-time kickoff return yards record. Currently, he and former Trojan Curtis Conway are tied at the top of the list with 1,723 yards.
Junior linebacker Uchenna Nwosu said the defense is excited to get the chance to stop another high-powered offense this weekend and earn the team’s first win away from the Coliseum.
“We want to make a statement,” Nwosu said. “We’ve got to keep building. On the road it’s harder — the crowd gets more involved. Every time someone plays USC it’s like their Super Bowl so you know everyone gives us their best game.”
The game kicks off Oct. 15 at 12:30 p.m. MT from Arizona Stadium and is being televised on Fox.

Lily Vaughan | Daily Trojan
The Los Angeles Police Department announced this month that it will reform current policies in response to public concerns over police shootings and accountability. According to the Los Angeles Times, they will work toward “releasing information to the public more quickly and expanding training designed to reduce the number of shootings.” The LAPD has encountered various cases related to police shootings. Walter William DeLeon, an unarmed man with a cloth was shot in the head, but the Police Commission later decided that given the situation, police action was justified. Another incident occurred in August 2016, when Donnell Thompson was shot, mistaken for a different suspect in a car hijacking case. In the last year, LAPD received much backlash for refusing to release video footage without a court order. For the last several months, across the nation, the Black Lives Matter movement, has continued to pressure police departments to hold their officers accountable for their actions.
While body cameras and other tools for increased transparency are a necessary starting point in restoring trust in the police system, they can also be demeaning for moral police officers and can serve as constant reminders of the distrust. These measures are necessary to reverse the backlash and misconduct that have come to light recently, but police officers should not always have to feel like they must prove themselves and compensate for the actions of other officers. Therefore, in the long-term, preventative methods and restructuring of police training and protocol are more effective and absolutely necessary. Body cameras are ultimately helpful, but must be accompanied by other measures.
It is clear that the relationship between the police and their communities, specifically those containing large percentages of people of color must be mended. A 2015 Gallup poll claimed that distrust for the police is the lowest it has been in 22 years. The Los Angeles Police Department in conjunction with Mayor Eric Garcetti are actively taking measures to be one of the most progressive and adaptable police forces in the nation. Movements to outfit every police officer with body cameras, while controversial, eventually passed with unanimous backing by the police commission. This would make the LAPD the biggest police department to implement such a widespread policy.
Increased transparency is the first important step in regaining the trust of the Los Angeles community. Body cameras allow citizens to see the commendable efforts of ethical police officers, and their commitment to maintaining safety. During a time when misconduct of police officers has been highlighted and publicized, examples of police integrity are essential to prove that officers’ ultimate goal is protect their citizens. Additionally, body cameras are an essential catalyst to the systemic change that activists are demanding from police departments. A study done by University of South Florida showed that “use-of-force” incidents dropped 53 percent with officers who utilized the body cameras. Body cameras hold officers accountable for their actions and allow civilians to feel secure in the fact that police actions are justified and truly done in the interest of public safety.
Body cameras were advocated in the study. Some more specific protocols were proposed as well, including limiting the number of attempts a police officer has to qualify with their service weapon, routine, reality-based training modules for all police officers in addition to those that take place in training and psychological assessments after shootings.
The acceptance and financial investment into this program proves the city and police department’s commitment to improving public opinion and decreasing incidents. Changes in protocol are far less costly to implement, and many already have the framework in place, only needing written procedure to progress.
As the third largest police department in the nation, the LAPD has the opportunity to set the standard for large police departments across the nation. The short-term and long-term proposals are sure to have positive benefits and effects on the community, and LAPD must remain committed to this mission.

Under the No Child Left Behind Act, students, schools and teachers have all been graded by student standardized test scores — despite the fact that studies have not been able to demonstrate conclusively that such a system is effective in increasing achievement. Schools should not measure teachers based on how students perform on exams. As this column has previously stated, it leads to an emphasis on teaching directly to the state accountability exam, thereby ignoring long-term goals.
But how can schools reduce the burden of testing while maintaining high standards? The Every Student Succeeds Act, signed by President Barack Obama last December, provides a potential solution. With this bill, according to the president, “we reaffirm that fundamental American ideal that every child, regardless of race, income, background, the zip code where they live, deserves the chance to make out of their lives what they will.” Now that No Child Left Behind, which heavily focused on a test-based accountability system, has been retired in favor of this new piece of legislation, ESSA provides states with an opportunity to create new assessment systems.
However, problems still remain; ESSA is supposed to reduce the burden of testing while maintaining annual information for parents and students, in order to help students and schools improve. Though ESSA shifts states away from high-stakes testing as a means of keeping schools accountable, it largely ignores the impact of a student’s socioeconomic status on his/her academic achievement.
A report known as FairTest details how a system centered around ESSA could be constructed. Under the new law, states shift accountability away from schools and teachers, and instead allow them to focus on providing genuine help to improve educational quality and equity. This new legislation includes an “Innovative Assessment” pilot project, which has already been proved successful in other programs like the New York Performance Standards Consortium and the International Baccalaureate program. A new method of assessing students’ thinking could include an observation by a teacher, a conversation between a student and teacher or reviewing a student’s work. These revised methods of interaction provide teachers with a valuable way to provide feedback, and a new way to determine a student’s depth of knowledge instead of relying on test scores.
However, under ESSA, districts would be subject to comparability measures to ensure whether students deemed proficient in one district would receive a similar evaluation in another. To fulfill ESSA’s public reporting and accountability requirements, FairTest’s model relies on classroom-based evidence, where teachers and students gather examples of learning throughout the school year. Then, with these examples, teachers prepare a summative evaluation of each pupil, which determines the student’s level of proficiency based on state standards. Overall, FairTest’s model is intended to help states design flexible systems that provide accountability measures other than traditional test-based ones, such as new assessment and comparability measures.
One major flaw, however, cannot be overlooked; ESSA largely ignores the impact of a student’s socioeconomic status on his or her learning. The FairTest approach focuses on how much a student learns from year one to year two, which is largely determined by the wealth of the student and the student’s school.
Similar to other efforts to measure school quality by measuring student achievement, FairTest’s model will demonstrate what is already known in education — that higher socioeconomic status schools are “good,”  and lower socioeconomic status schools are “bad.” In fact, the socioeconomic status of a child’s parents has always been one of the best predictors of the child’s academic achievement and educational attainment. Students with wealthier parents tend to attend schools that have greater levels of funding, which results in greater access to extracurricular activities, classroom resources, counseling services and more rigorous academic courses.
Until teachers, schools and states can better understand and subsequently address the effects of wealth on students’ level of achievement, legislation like ESSA and schools models like FairTest’s will only partly remedy the educational attainment gaps that exist between students of different classes. Nonetheless, this legislation and the new FairTest model are monumental and important steps.

Professor Ken Nealson is the Wrigley Chair in Environmental Studies at USC. Over the last 45 years, Nealson has had a hand in many fields. Technically, his lab is part of the earth sciences division. However, it is also a environmental microbiology lab, a biogeochemistry lab, and a geoelectrochemistry lab. The more niche the science gets, the longer the name it’s given. 
I recently had the chance to visit the lab, and dive into the world of microbiology. It was true naiveté on my part to think that an hour in the lab would help me grasp 45 years of Nealson’s research —the last time I took a science course, President Obama was in his first term as president. And so, as I entered the foreign, tiny world of microbes and bacteria, I quickly descended into the swirling maw of scientific illiteracy.
Thankfully, Nealson is both a passionate scientist and a patient teacher. Back in 1988, he discovered Shewanella Oneidensis. To the layman, or the philosophy student, it sounds like a foreign language (perhaps Latin). For Nealson, it’s a bit more simple than that. “Bacteria don’t do anything but chemistry, and lots of it,” he said. And in the Nealson lab, there’s lots of bacteria.
Lab Manager Pournami Rajeev walked me in a circle around the lab (it takes up the entire 5th floor of Stauffer Hall), and the first thing I noticed was Professor Nealson’s likeness posted on the walls, in meme format. Undoubtedly put up by Nealson’s grad students, the posters bear captions like “I’m watching you,” and “get back to work!” The researchers are a casual, friendly bunch. It’s not uncommon to find them chatting in the conference room, or going out to lunch together. The social setting more resembles a geeky science club than a quiet science lab.
But in many ways, Nealson’s lab matched up with my mental schema of what a science lab should look like: beakers and pipettes aplenty, machines humming and whirring, colored wires connecting science to more science. And yet, what seemed like high-tech equipment to me is, in fact, rather dated. The experiments conducted in this lab are reliant upon traditional tools, and the tried-and-tested organizational system of sticking post-it notes on everything reigns supreme.
Surprisingly, the lab contains only one microscope. So how can the researchers see what is happening in their experiments? After all, they are focused on bacteria, and bacterial behavior is unobservable without the aid of a microscope. But you don’t need to see the bacteria to see how they affect their environment. The basic idea is that you can isolate a certain bacteria and place them in a chemostat — a tank that is sort of like an aquarium, but for bacteria. The chemostat keeps a stable solution that can be manipulated by the researchers: the chemostat maintains environmental homeostasis, so researchers can isolate and alter a single variable, such as the amount of nutrients in the solution, without compromising the experiment. Then by examining how the bacteria interacts with the environment, they can learn about how bacteria grow under different conditions. 
In addition to a few chemostats, Nealson’s lab boasts an autoclave, a centrifuge, chromatography instruments, two spectrophotometers, and many other gadgets. If this seems like gibberish to you, then we are alike. The science laboratory is an alien environment, a Wonka-esque playground with microbes instead of candy.  
Because so many bacteria samples move through the lab, the researchers need storage space; for this, they rely upon two different kinds of freezers. One is kept at -80ºC, and is used for long-term storage. At this temperature, it is too cold for the bacteria to grow and multiply, but not cold enough to kill them. It basically freezes them in the state they were in when placed in the freezer. When Rajeev cleans the freezer, she layers five pairs of latex gloves to avoid freezer burn. 
The other freezer is kept at 4ºC, and it is used for short-term preservation. It’s a walk-in freezer, about the size of a standard bedroom, and on the hot September day I spent in the lab it was rather refreshing to spend a couple minutes in there. The walls are lined with various solutions, all labeled with handwritten notes. Many of the jars appear to be filled with water, but really they are teeming with life.
All the contraptions are dedicated to studying this microbial life — it’s invisible to the naked eye, but the scientific implications are too big to ignore. Nealson’s Shewanella discovery was most important because it is the first documented bacteria that ‘breathes rock.’ This means that instead of using oxygen for respiration, as mammals do, Shewanella uses manganese. 
It was a radical finding, and Nealson faced a large pushback from the scientific community. It goes against all conventional wisdom — “the textbooks said it wasn’t possible,” he told me. It was an uphill battle for Nealson to demonstrate his findings to the scientific community, but after years of study and many peer-reviewed papers, rock-breathing bacteria are now the focus of much scientific inquiry.
In Nealson’s lab, graduate students are studying how Shewanella and bacteria with similar breathing techniques can be used to solve environmental problems. From turning waste into water to producing energy, Shewanella has demonstrated remarkable potential to solve some of the world’s most pressing problems. 
Professor Nealson is excited, and a little bummed out by the promising research. “This is an important discovery,” he says. “I wish I had discovered it earlier.”
So it goes. Scientific research is a long, arduous process. Sure, Nealson first recognized Shewanella in 1988, but we are still a ways from fully understanding how it works. Biological processes, even in simple organisms like bacteria, are incredibly complicated and require many repetitions of experiments to actually gain a sophisticated understanding. Huge discoveries in science don’t happen in an instant — they must be confirmed and re-confirmed by the scientific community at-large in order to be accepted as theory. It’s a rigorous process, one that requires a tenderness and care for your subject. 
Nealson displays this tenderness when he speaks about his work. He’s sometimes called “the father of Shewanella,” and he is one proud papa. He even likes to refer to the bacteria as ‘Shewie.’ Like any father, he wants to spend time with his microbial progeny, and see it reach its full potential. 
Hopefully, he will still be around to see Shewie’s graduation — from impossible discovery, to textbook example.

An 18-year-old woman was found guilty Thursday of the murder of USC graduate student Xinran Ji, who was killed during an attempted robbery off campus in 2014.
Photo courtesy of USC NewsA life cut short · Xinran Ji, a graduate of Zhejiang University in China who was working toward his master’s degree in electrical engineering at USC, was killed in 2014 during an attempted robbery near campus. He was 24.
Jurors convicted Alejandra Guerrero on all counts for charges of first-degree murder, second-degree attempted robbery and assault with a deadly weapon in Ji’s case. She was also found guilty of second-degree robbery and assault with a deadly weapon in the case of Claudia Rocha, who was attacked several hours after the assault on Ji.
The sentencing is scheduled for Nov. 28. Guerrero, who was a minor at the time the crime was committed and therefore is not eligible for the death penalty, could face up to a life sentence in prison and at minimum will be sentenced to 25 years to life. Three others — Andrew Garcia, Jonathan DelCarmen and Alberto Ochoa — are also charged with Ji’s murder, but will be tried later in the year.
Jurors deliberated for just over a day before delivering the verdict in Guerrero’s case, following a two-week trial that began with opening arguments on Sept. 30. Prosecutor John McKinney presented evidence during the trial that suggested Guerrero and the others with her had specifically targeted Ji, including Facebook messages that referenced “flocking,” a term Guerrero and her peers used to describe robbing.
McKinney argued that there was no evidence Guerrero had been forced to attack Ji, and that she participated of her own free will. Ji’s blood was found on the jeans Guerrero was wearing that night, and video evidence presented during the trial showed Guerrero striking Ji with a wrench, which McKinney said was one of the fatal blows.
Guerrero’s attorney Errol Cook, however, argued that Guerrero was the youngest of the attackers and thus was clearly not the leader of the group. Cook presented the defense’s arguments during cross-examination of the prosecution witnesses to cast doubt on the prosecutor’s argument that Guerrero had acted willfully to kill Ji.
Ji, a graduate engineering student from China, was attacked on July 24, 2014, as he was walking back to his off-campus apartment near 29th Street and Orchard Avenue. Evidence presented during the trial showed a car pulling up next to Ji and Garcia, Ochoa and Guerrero jumping out; Ochoa went after Ji with a baseball bat and struck the first blow, while Garcia followed with a second blow from the bat and Guerrero attacked Ji with a wrench.
After the attack, Ji dragged himself back to his apartment and was found lifeless the next morning by his roommate. Medical reports indicate that he suffered a broken nose, internal bleeding, several skull fractures and lacerations all over his face.
Ochoa and Garcia were taken into custody roughly two hours after Ji was attacked, when a man they allegedly attempted to rob called the police near Dockweiler State Beach. DelCarmen and Guerrero were arrested later that day after the robbery attempt on Claudia Rocha.
