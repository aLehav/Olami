Senior Justin Suh reached what is arguably the peak of his young career so far, as he became the No. 1 ranked golfer on the World Amateur Golf Rankings, ousting previously top-ranked Braden Thornberry of Ole Miss. Suh entered the season ranked second behind Thornberry, but took over the top spot after top-10 finishes in both of the Trojans’ matches this season.
In the Fighting Illini Invitational in mid-September, Suh finished in fourth place at 2-under-par while leading the Trojans to a second place finish in the tournament. Just a couple weeks later, Suh placed 10th overall at the Nike Golf Collegiate Invitational to lead the team to a ninth-place finish. Suh’s efforts have helped USC move up 13 places in the Division I rankings from No. 20 as they currently sit in seventh.  
In his past 12 tournaments, Suh has performed consistently at a competitive level, securing 11 top-10 finishes. Suh was named an All-American last year and was also the 2018 Pac-12 Player of the Year. In the process, Suh broke USC records for lowest stroke average and most rounds under 70. He looks to be a finalist for prestigious collegiate awards such as the Jack Nicklaus National Player of the Year Award, the Ben Hogan Award and the Fred Haskins Award, all of which he contended for last year.
Outside of his contributions to USC, Suh has gained attention in the WAGR due to his impressive performances on the amateur scene. Just before the start of the college golf season, Suh placed third at the Eisenhower Trophy tournament in Ireland, finishing under 70 in all four days of the tournament. Suh also placed first in the Northeast Amateur Invitational in June, finishing under 68 in all four rounds of play.  
Suh is inching closer to qualification into the PGA tour and earning the No. 1 ranking for the WAGR has helped his case even more.

The Women of Troy have had a strong start to the 2018 season and look to continue their hot streak. (Daily Trojan file photo)
The No. 11 USC women’s swim and dive team travels to Salt Lake City on Friday to take on Utah in its first Pac-12 meet of the season. The Women of Troy look to take down the 0-2 Utes a week after a second-place finish at last weekend’s SMU Classic and first-place wins for individuals at the Trojan Invitational. 
At the Trojan Invite earlier this month, the hosting Trojans showed out thanks to wins from seniors Alex Valente and Riley Scott and All-American junior Louise Hansson.
USC swept the women’s 100-yard breaststroke, with fast times from defending Pac-12 champion Scott (1:00.55), redshirt junior Kirsten Vose (1:01.12) and sophomore Maggie Aroesty third (1:01.39).
The Trojans continued their dominance in the breaststroke standings, with four top-performers in the 200-yard breaststroke in Scott (2:08.13), Aroesty (2:12.89), Odgers (2:14.04) and junior Piper Brockley (2:15.36). 
Hansson returns to Troy this season after winning the 100-yard fly in last season’s NCAA Championships and finishing third in the 200.
Hansson followed up wins at the Trojan Invite in the 100-yard fly and 100-yard free with even better performances at the SMU Classic, a tournament USC won in 2017.
This year, the Women of Troy finished with 312 points. The team was only bested by Louisville, which captured the title with 358. Virginia came in third (299) with Iowa in fourth (236.5), Miami in fifth (227.5) and SMU sixth in (226).
Scott, who won the 100-yard breaststroke on Friday, doubled up with a win in the 200-yard IM on Saturday with a time of 1:59.52, a full second ahead of the competition.
Hansson added to her 100-yard backstroke victory by posting a win in the 200-yard back (1:53.10.)
Saturday’s affair started with the 200-yard medley relay as USC took second with Hansson, Scott, junior Catherine Sanchez and sophomore Marta Ciesla in 1:38.51.
Ciesla, who took the 50-yard free on Friday, finished second in the 100-yard free in a season-best NCAA B time of 48.95 while senior Kirsten Vose finished second in the B final in 50.22.
On the other side of the laplines, Utah comes into Friday’s meet after two-straight Pac-12 losses to top-ranked Stanford and Cal last weekend. 
Despite Utah’s 191-101 loss at Stanford, the Utes won a couple of individual and team events over the Cardinal.
Utah’s senior captain Darby Wayner captured the 200-yard IM in 2:05.51 and sophomore Emma Ruchala won the one-meter dive with a score of 248.1, while Utah’s combination of freshman Aryanna Fernandes, senior Gillian St. John, freshman Audrey Reimer and junior Sarah Lott pulled off another win in the 200-yard free relay with a time of 1:35.72.
At Cal, the Utes fell in similar fashion to the Golden Bears, this time by a count of 111.5-184.5. 
While Cal won a majority of the races, junior Genny Robertson’s 2:15:39 in the 200-yard breast and junior Jordan Anderson’s 4:21:85 in the 400-yard IM were good enough to seal victories for Utah. 
As Utah’s lone swimmer in the NCAA tournament and school record holder in the 400-yard IM, Anderson is expected to anchor a Utah squad which went 5-4 last year and finished seventh in the Pac-12 tournament. 
Not to mention, the Utes finished second in nine races, including 200-yard breaststroke where the top three finishers — Roberston, Wayner and junior Mariah Gassaway — wore the red and black. 
Top-three performances from first-year swimmers Reimer, freshman Emma Lawless and Fernandes signal promise for a Utah team that sports a blend of old and new talent. 
This won’t be the last time the Women of Troy and Utes will compete this season. Utah will travel  to Los Angeles for the multi-team Trojan Diving Invitational on Nov. 10 and 11.

Senior linebacker Porter Gustin left the Colorado game with a fractured ankle and won’t return this year. (Josh Dunst | Daily Trojan)
USC football took a huge blow Sunday when the team announced that senior linebacker Porter Gustin would miss the remainder of the season with a fractured ankle. As the team practiced Wednesday in preparation of Saturday’s road matchup with Utah, Gustin’s absence loomed over the proceedings.
Gustin’s seven sacks lead the Pac-12, and the Trojan pass rush has noticeably struggled when he has been out this season. The team is turning to redshirt junior defensive lineman Christian Rector and redshirt freshman linebacker Hunter Echols to fill in for Gustin at the “predator” position. 
“Replacing [Gustin] is a tough thing to do, but we have to have a next guy up mentality,” Rector said. “We have a good scheme, a good system, so I have to execute it.”
No other player on the Trojan defense has more than 1.5 sacks, so the team has big shoes to fill. The pass rush was still excellent when Gustin was injured last season, but that team featured threats like Uchenna Nwosu and Rasheem Green, both of whom have departed for the NFL.
Defensive coordinator Clancy Pendergast said there is no replacing a player of Gustin’s caliber. 
“Everything from work ethic, helping people get lined up during the game, helping to coach the younger guys at practice, to playing and competing at a high level,” Pendergast said. “He’s someone that you can’t replace.”
Gustin’s injury comes at possibly the worst time for the Trojans, with the most important game of their season coming up on Saturday. Utah boasts a strong offensive line, with four starters of at least 310 pounds, so USC’s front seven will have its work cut out for it.
“They’re very physical up front, they do a nice job in the running game,” Pendergast said. “[Junior Zack] Moss, the running back, is very much a downhill perimeter runner, the [junior] quarterback [Tyler Huntley] is a true dual-threat guy, and they’ve got a lot of speed outside. So they can hurt you in a lot of different ways offensively.” 
Moss has rushed for 617 yards and seven touchdowns on 110 attempts, averaging 102.8 yards per game and 5.6 yards per carry this season. Huntley is the team’s second-leading rusher, with 207 yards and three touchdowns on 75 attempts.
“They’re really physical, their [offensive] line is really big up front,” said freshman linebacker Palaie Gaoteote. “They compact the box and try to run it down your throat.”
Utah’s offense is on the rise, putting up 40 or more points in its previous two games against Arizona and Stanford. As Pendergast said, the improvement has been most evident in the run game, as the Utes topped 220 rushing yards in both games.
“They’ve gotten themselves in a lot more manageable third down situations, therefore they’re winning on first down,” Pendergast said of the Utes’ recent improvement. “Their offense is very impressive, and it’s a completely different style of offense than what we faced last week in Colorado.”
If there’s an area the USC defense can exploit in Utah’s run game, it’s Huntley’s propensity for taking negative plays. The junior signal-caller has 112 negative yards on rushing attempts this season, which the Trojans can take advantage of if they get into the backfield repeatedly like they did against Colorado.
Huntley has solid overall numbers in the passing game: He completes 64 percent of his passes for 203.5 yards per game, with seven touchdowns and three interceptions. With Gustin gone, other USC pass rushers will have to contain the speedy Huntley so he can’t make plays outside the pocket. Even so, Helton said the team was focusing on stopping Utah’s run game.
“Hopefully, we can do like last game and maybe get up or create third and longs where you’re putting them more in passing situations,” Helton said. “Because when they can lean on that run game, lean on the play-action game, they’re good. That’s right in their backyard.” 
Utah is notable for its rowdy atmosphere, which the Trojans prepared for this Wednesday by filtering crowd noise during their third down drills. If the practice was any indication, though, the Trojans will struggle to match the energy; the session was quiet, lacking the contentious competitiveness that had characterized the practices over their three-game winning streak.
Injury update
Helton said that both Gaoteote and senior linebacker Cam Smith are close to game ready, but neither have been medically cleared yet. Smith is recovering from a hamstring injury, while Gaoteote has not yet cleared concussion protocol.
Smith was unavailable after practice, but Gaoteote said he was improving every day and feeling better.
The team also pulled redshirt junior offensive guard Jacob Daniel with knee soreness.

Last week, one of my favorite soccer players came out for the (kind of, sort of) first time, and I almost cried out of happiness.
It was probably an overreaction on my part, because Ali Krieger — the starting right back for the Orlando Pride and former star of the U.S. women’s soccer team — has kind of been out for years. She’s lived with her longtime girlfriend, who plays goalkeeper for both teams, for years. They moved continents together and adopted a dog together, but until the last few weeks, Krieger had refused to come out personally or label her relationship.
As a fan, I never really minded. Women’s soccer isn’t really waiting for out-and-proud queer stars, and I figured that personal life is personal for a reason, so Krieger definitely didn’t owe anyone an explanation for her life. So I was confused at my reaction to her subtle coming out, which was a long time coming and felt almost superfluous and yet sent me close to tears.
The thing is that it does matter when athletes come out. It matters for the same reason that it matters when black women play lead roles in movies, and when Asian athletes excel in the NBA. It matters because, for those of us who are often on the sidelines, seeing a reflection of ourselves as a starter gives a much-needed boost of hope.
My mom never understood why it was so important for me to have role models who were like me. She always assumed that if I had someone to look up to, that was enough, regardless of whether or not that person was a woman or gay. In a lot of ways, she was right. Many of the writers who shaped my young style the most were straight men — Eric Adler from the Kansas City Star, Lee Jenkins and Rick Reilly of Sports Illustrated.
It took finding a true role model, a woman (like me), who was gay (like me) and loved sports(like me), for my mom to understand the power of a role model. 
It took Kate Fagan. 
Kate Fagan, for anyone who’s unlucky enough to not know her name immediately, is a writer and broadcaster for ESPN. She’s one of the best writers I know, the type who makes you change your afternoon schedule when she publishes a new article. Several years ago, Fagan wrote a feature that sprawled into a book, “What Made Maddy Run,” about a promising Penn track star who committed suicide.
That feature changed my life. It came out at a time when I was trying to decide whether or not to pursue sports journalism. And then this feature was dropped in my lap, unbelievably moving and breathtakingly well-written. It was everything I wanted to write, and it was written by a woman, a woman who I quickly found out was queer just like me.
This was a first. There were a few women who I looked up to in the business, but they were mostly commentators and broadcasters. And there was an even smaller handful of female sports writers whose work I admired. But I had never come across a woman who was so much like me, who understood everything I had been through and would go through.
Practically overnight, Fagan became part of my identity as a sports reporter. I wanted to be her. She represented everything I wanted out of my life. When anyone asked what I wanted to do, I said I wanted to be a feature writer like Fagan. Her name became synonymous with how I pictured my future success.
Of course, if I hadn’t known she was a gay woman, I still would have looked up to Fagan all the same. Her writing is in a league of its own, and her work should be carefully studied by anyone who hopes to write about sports for a living.
That’s the thing about representation. It shouldn’t matter. It really, honestly, shouldn’t matter what the skin color or gender or sexual orientation of a quarterback or TV analyst is, so long as they do their job well. But when you’re used to seeing the same story, told again and again, it’s hard to believe that a different story — your story — will ever be listened to or received.
There’s no timetable for coming out, and I would never want an athlete to make that decision before they are fully ready. But when it happens, it makes an impact, one that might not be seen immediately but that is wholly, deeply felt.
When athletes come out, it’s a silent affirmation to every little queer kid who wants to play ball or write about it or just likes to watch from home. It highlights that we are welcome here, that we can do this, that we belong in this space and these jerseys just like anyone else.

Netflix’s latest limited series stars Emma Stone and Jonah Hill as Annie Landsberg and Owen Milgrim, respectively. “Maniac” is directed by Cary Fukunaga. (Photo from IMDb)
Psychedelic visuals and a thrilling premise fall flat in Netflix’s recent small-screen enterprise, “Maniac,” a 10-episode limited series directed by Cary Fukunaga and starring Emma Stone and Jonah Hill. Released on the site on Sept. 21, it follows Owen Milgrim (Hill) and Annie Landsberg (Stone), two troubled souls mired in familial and financial crises who meet when they both volunteer for a highly lucrative and dangerous drug trial. 
Owen is a diagnosed schizophrenic, outcast by his family but welcomed back when they need him to lie in court to help his blatantly-guilty brother. Meanwhile, Annie is a drug-addict who seeks consolation from an irreconcilable fight she had with her younger sister years ago. The pharmaceutical trial they enter involves three pills taken consecutively that lowers the subjects’ mental defenses so they can confront their inner demons. Once the pills are swallowed, volunteers are transported into simulations that resemble whatever problems are stirring their subconscious. If all goes according to plan — which almost never happens — the drug promises to spot and battle all their mental ailments.  
“Maniac” has an undeniably attractive premise: two interesting characters stuck in a dangerous drug-trial gone wrong. Yet, the fairly simple idea goes awry once it opens in scope and becomes imbalanced. 
“Maniac” dabbles in an eclectic selection of styles and tones, but its creators never make up their minds on which to fully adopt. At times, it is deeply inquisitive, pushing its own theories about destiny in the cosmos; at others, it can be overwhelmingly emotional, tense and action-packed. Still, it loses track of itself when it dabbles in misplaced humor, bizarre characterization and gratuitous violence. There is one especially startling scene in which Owen witnesses a man’s head being drilled in by a crime boss.The scene does not achieve its Tarantino-esque purpose of capturing the audience’s attention through violence — instead, the grotesque, misplaced effect only disgusts viewers. 
Protagonists are meant to interest the audience either through empathy or an earnest desire to see what they will do next, but the main characters in “Maniac” barely evoke any of these feelings. 
Neither Owen nor Annie are by any means flat characters, but their personalities and struggles are overwhelming. They have equally scarring backstories and face a number of issues, but both stories plateau once the plot piles on ever-thickening layers of complexity. Whatever connection may have been budding between protagonist and audience is prematurely nipped by overly ambitious choices on Fukunaga’s part, such as the addition of a storyline involving a suddenly sentient A.I. that sabotages the drug trial.
Ultimately, satisfying character arcs are sacrificed in exchange for plot convenience. Annie and Owen are inexplicably connected in their simulations by the supercomputer monitoring the trial, but the loose ends of their relationship are resolved far too quickly after the A.I. that introduced them is put away. In a matter of two scenes, the audience is expected to be satisfied with the results, but is instead left wondering how these two are suddenly smiling after feeling utterly hopeless just five minutes ago. 
A mere three strands hold “Maniac” together: Stone, Hill and its visual design. The actors showcase their undeniable talent (Stone won an Academy Award for her role in “La La Land” and Hill is a two-time nominee) in how they can readily shift their performances, even with the questionable tonal changes Fukunaga employs. Stone is especially outstanding in her role as Annie; her commitment to the part is contagious, and she shines in vulnerable moments when Annie must divulge all her repressed emotions. Despite how convoluted their characters are, Hill and Stone keep viewers sufficiently interested through sheer talent. 
After the lead performances, the visual design is the most rewarding. The bulk of the plot takes place inside a pastel-drenched laboratory illuminated mainly by an occasional, pulsating neon light. Whenever the test subjects are experiencing the effects of the drug, they fall asleep in psych ward recliners while a neon light flickers and fills the shot. The repeated luscious effect reflects the psychedelic nature of the drug itself, and it is easily one of the most captivating aspects of the series.
Cinematography and star power are just enough to push the show up a notch, but “Maniac” is not a wholly rewarding experience. In its ambition, it conjures up one too many storylines and hastily resolves them. Restricted to only 10 episodes, the complicated series fails to connect viewers with its characters’ struggles, and, without this key relationship, rarely persuades viewers to click on the next episode.

It’s midterm season at USC, and stress is at an all-time high.  In fact, a 2016 study showed that 31 percent of students have their highest rates of stress around finals weeks. Whether it be staying up all night studying in Leavey Library, or frantically cramming an hour before a midterm, everyone has their own methods to cope with the pressure — most of which are not particularly healthy. While studying and doing well on exams are important, students must remember to unwind. Here are several ways to relax ahead of that looming deadline or exam date:
Improved sleep is vitally important for brain functionality. Sleep deprivation can affect memory, judgment and mood, all of which are important for test-taking and overall emotional health. According to the American Psychological Association, sleeping just 60 to 90 extra minutes a night can noticeably improve health and happiness.
Working out is the last thing anyone wants to do when they’re overwhelmed or stressed, but exercise can drastically improve mood and retention when studying. Exercise has been proven to help with energy, alertness, concentration and cognitive function. All registered USC students receive free gym memberships to the three gyms on campus during the school year, and the Lyon Center and USC Village Fitness Center are open from 6 a.m. to midnight Monday through Friday. Whether you prefer to walk, run, swim or dance, these activities reduce stress tremendously.
Completely focusing your attention on something other than an upcoming test can be extremely helpful. Meditation is a soothing way to de-stress for a while and just relax. While there are seemingly endless options for meditation, a good start could be reading and reflecting, repeating a mantra, focusing on different parts of the body, walking or simply breathing deeply. Try apps like “Headspace” and “Calm” for a guided meditation. Meditation is also convenient; it can be done on the metro, upon waking up in the morning or even between classes. 
Similar to meditation, listening to music can be a great way to help you get out of your head. In fact, listening to music has been proven to calm down hospital patients before and after surgery, as well as relieve depression and increase self-esteem in elderly people, according to studies. 
Sometimes, when you’re about to reach a breaking point with studying and writing papers, you just need to put your responsibilities on hold and do something fun. There’s always something interesting happening, either on USC’s campus or the greater Los Angeles area. The Rose Garden and Natural History Museum located right next to campus are free for USC students. Destinations like Olvera Street, Little Tokyo and Santa Monica are just a short metro ride away. For Cardinal and Gold students (freshmen, that’s you), the ResX app always showcases free upcoming events on campus. USC Visions and Voices also hosts events open to all USC students several times a week — just be sure to RSVP on its website. 
USC’s furry “well-being ambassador,” Professor Beauregard Tirebiter is a hypoallergenic goldendoodle and an instant stress reducer.  A full-time faculty member, Beau is available from noon to 1 p.m. on Tuesdays and 11:30 a.m. to 12:30 p.m. on Thursdays in the Student Wellness Lounge at Engemann Student Health Center. You can also follow Beau on social media (@Beau_USC) for a little stress relief during an Instagram break, or arrange for him to visit your student organization.
USC also offers free counseling services through Engemann Student Health Center. Educate yourself on the resources available to students and do what is right for you.

Ramen KenJo is the first ramen eatery to open at USC Village. (Maansi Manchanda | Daily Trojan)
Ramen KenJo, USC Village’s debut Japanese eatery, was packed over Trojan Family Weekend, with a 20-minute wait time just an hour after its soft opening on Friday. However, USC students who have been eagerly anticipating the addition of a ramen shop to USC Village might find themselves disappointed by Ramen KenJo’s fast-food style noodles priced at restaurant rates. 
Customers can start off by ordering pan-fried gyoza, boiled edamame or karaage, Japanese fried chicken, as appetizers for upward of $4. Chicken, cha-siu or tuna donburi are the only rice dishes currently available. 
Its menu offers two types of ramen: the KenJo Ramen and KenJo Ultra Ramen. The KenJo Ramen line provides all the basic ramen ingredients, with tonkotsu, shio chicken and spicy miso. There is pork broth, and chicken broth with a vegetarian option “coming soon.” Customers can add toppings such as kimchi, bean sprouts and nori sheets at an additional cost. 
The KenJo Ultra Ramen series includes extra toppings such as corn, bamboo chutes and spam. The Shadow Maker, a pork broth-based soup comes with cha-siu pork belly, roasted black garlic oil, corn and red ginger. 
Its flavor is underwhelming, with a single piece of nori drowning in the broth and barely any bean sprouts. The pork broth is unextraordinary, and less seasoned than customers may be used to. It has the same greasy consistency as most ramen soup bases, but less of the flavor. Moreover, the noodles were overcooked, with the consistency of instant ramen — but cost $11.50. 
The tonkotsu ramen is one of the most popular items at Ramen KenJo. At $9.50, it’s a simpler version of the Shadow Maker with just the cha-siu pork belly and red ginger. Another popular dish is the Meat Up, from the Ultra Ramen series, which has cha-siu pork belly, kurobota sausage, slow cooked chicken, corn and red ginger for $12.50. 
The Ronin, is a broth-less ramen dish with spicy miso and bamboo shoots, seems intriguing at first but turns out to be a disappointing mouthful of spicy, overcooked noodles. 
All dishes are served in paper bowls, and customers must get their own utensils. The space is not big enough to seat all the customers, but outdoor seating is available at USC Village Piazza.
Ramen KenJo has a lot to improve on in order to be a major competitor Ebaes, a popular ramen and Japanese cuisine destination near campus. While the portion sizes are decent, the quality of the food isn’t worth the price. Students are better off going to Ebaes on the first day of every month for its $5 ramen deals. 
Of course, Ramen KenJo has just opened and is still hiring, so customer service will likely improve in the coming weeks. But for now, customers may still be inconvenienced by workers asking them to stand up for them to get more napkins from the benches, which double as storage bins. 
As of Friday, Ramen KenJo’s grand opening date has not been determined, but for now the soft opening hours are from 11:30 a.m. to 9:30 p.m.

After years of anticipation, Christina Tosi’s Milk Bar has finally planted its roots on the West Coast. Located in one of the busiest areas of Los Angeles, the shop has welcomed lines of eager people winding around Melrose Avenue like any of its popular streetwear stores. Milk Bar has been the subject of much apprehension beyond its reputation in New York, Tosi’s creation was featured in the pastry season of Netflix’s “Chef’s Table.” If there’s anything more exciting than a popular bakery crossing the country, it’s one that opened a season of a Netflix show. 
I have a sweet tooth. I like candy and cookies, and after every meal I need something for dessert. Bakeries are a particular joy, and making sweets is a pastime that brings happiness not only to myself, but also to those around me. Milk Bar was born from a similar notion from the bottom of Tosi’s heart: a love of sugar.
Milk Bar has a creative lineup of signature desserts, entrenched in nostalgia and ingredients familiar to the American palate: cornflakes, sweet corn, sprinkles. While the sweets taste like childhood, they also taste patriotic. There is no lavish presentation of laminated dough; no extravagant displays of French technique or scientific method. Instead, the cookies taste like cookies, the cake like cake — an elevated, unique take on classic bake sale sweets. The desserts are quilted blankets of salt and sugar, composed of creamy and crunchy. And in the same vein, the simple complexity of Milk Bar is its own gastronomic feat.
I have a sweet tooth. I love to indulge in sugar. It is something that I have always felt, in a way, encouraged to eat: Candy appears all over girls’ clothing, backpacks and other merchandise. Images of cupcakes and cakes are often pink and covered in delicate toppings, a hallmark expression of femininity. 
People have always linked me (and other women) to sweet-themed nicknames: honey, sugar, sweetie, sweetheart. 
The L.A. store offers a similar menu to that of its New York siblings: Centerpiece items are the cereal milk soft serve, crack pie, compost cookie and naked cake. The names themselves are a nod to the playfulness that shines through everything Tosi creates.
And, like its other locations, the Milk Bar in Los Angeles comes fitted with several photogenic backdrops: A succulent wall decorates the exterior, and the neon pink “Milk” sign attracts cell phone cameras like moths to a flame. Scroll through any Milk Bar hashtag, website or Yelp page, and there will be many an outstretched hand gesturing a cup of cornflake-dusted soft serve toward the sign.
I have a sweet tooth. In a way, my sweet tooth felt ordained by the world I was living in. There was no shame in my sweet tooth — unlike men who have a passion for dessert, I don’t sacrifice any masculinity in enjoying it.
The sweets themselves all feel carefully composed, balancing decadence and dairy product with precision. The cereal milk soft serve maintains an element of saltiness from the toasted cornflakes, rich with the taste of whole milk — a near-perfect replica of the real thing, only better. The crack pie is dense with a thick mixture of butter and sugar, the refreshing crunch of the corn cookie crust breaking the overwhelming richness of the dish. The portion is quite small for its price, but it is still plenty. The compost cookie, as well as the other cookies sold at Milk Bar, are large and crammed with filling, allowing each new bite to break the monotony of the last one. 
There are a slew of other baked goods purveyed at the Milk Bar store, including milkshakes and truffles, but perhaps its most recognizable dessert is the naked cake: three layers of moist cake, with flavorings and frosting in-between, but nothing to decorate its exterior. The cake stands unfrosted, showing off its delicate layering and infallible moistness. They are good cakes, celebrity-inducing cakes, celebrity-endorsed cakes (Jay-Z and Beyoncé are rumored to have raved about it during Taylor Swift’s 25th birthday party). And within the world of foodies, Tosi is a true celebrity.
But Christina Tosi is a shining and near-solitary female celebrity chef in an ocean of male celebrity chefs. 
I have a sweet tooth. I have a passion for dessert. And if I wanted to pursue that passion, I’m lucky — pastry is one of the only careers in food that champions women. Even without that passion, superiors in the kitchen will often place women in some pastry position, because they assume women will naturally enjoy it. 
It’s no shock when I say that the restaurant industry is sexist. Despite the sweeping social movements encouraging women to gain more power in the workplace, it seems that the culinary world is still stuck in the 1950s. In culinary school, women face the realization that it will be much more difficult for them to succeed than their male counterparts. In the kitchen, many women are subjected to both harassment and abuse, physical and verbal, with little consequence. And, as head chefs, people often scrutinize their leadership and authority. Ripples of workplace sexism in other careers are waves of misogyny in the world of food. 
For many inspired female chefs, baking is one of the only ways to succeed in the workplace. Pastry chefs are given a fair amount of control and can create visually and gastronomically stunning delights. In some cases like Tosi’s, pastry can lead to a prosperous baking career. For others, it can be a spectacular jumpstart for their own restaurants. 
Pastry is, more or less, a female-dominated culinary world. So why, then, did Netflix’s “Chef’s Table” only feature one woman in its season dedicated to pastry? 
I have a sweet tooth. I am a woman. Long ago, somewhere deep in human history, the link between sugar and femininity was formed, and it still hasn’t broken. Maybe it’s some exercise in willpower: Men are expected to resist sweets, while women are expected to enjoy them. Or maybe it is strictly because meat is seen as masculine and sugar is seen as the opposite. 
There’s still hope for the culinary world. More and more women are opening their own high-end bakeries and restaurants. More women are excelling in the limelight, bolstered by a climate that’s beginning to show signs of support. More women are winning awards; the 2018 James Beard Awards recognized a diverse and large number of women in food, a refreshing first. There is still plenty of room for the food industry to grow and welcome more brilliant women, and hopefully it will.
Tosi’s Milk Bar empire stands not only as a great place for ice cream and cookies, but as a beacon of hope for aspiring women in food everywhere. Creativity, ingenuity and hard work resulted in a multi-store expansion, and a national reputation. 
Christina Tosi has a sweet tooth. I have a sweet tooth. It might have something to do with my gender, but I think I just love sweets.

“The big one is coming.” Any native Californian has heard this phrase a thousand times, and will continue to hear it until “the big one” — the large, possibly catastrophic, earthquake that has been predicted for years — actually happens. 
Thursday is the annual Great California ShakeOut, founded at USC’s earthquake center, where more than 10 million participants across the state take part in an international earthquake drill in order to raise awareness for earthquake safety. This year is the organization’s 10th year of operation, as it has held annual drills since 2008. Though USC, UCLA, Loyola Marymount, Cal State Los Angeles and Santa Monica Community College are all participating, the tangible effect this drill has had on universities across California is uncertain.
USC, which happens to rest in the middle of several major fault lines, does not seem too preoccupied with the prospect of a big earthquake happening in the immediate future. Maybe one day a year isn’t enough preparation for a school of 47,500 people, many of whom have never experienced an earthquake or lived in an earthquake zone. 
Since the start of the school year, there has been no school-wide discussion on any precautions to take in case of an earthquake. The University is not doing enough to prepare its students and faculty for a large-scale emergency, such as a major earthquake. 
As of now, the University is planning on participating in and hosting the worldwide effort. It has asked asking students to register online to participate in the event, but made no greater attempts to get students involved, aside from a memo emailed on Tuesday.
“All students will be receiving memos from USC reminding them what to do in case of an earthquake,” said Steve Goldfarb, an expert on emergency and disaster preparedness at USC. While this may be true, it is hard for students to remember something they were never taught in the first place.
It’s unlikely that a mere email will affect real change. The memo will most likely be buried in students’ inboxes and not taken very seriously.
“We use the ShakeOut as that major educational push,” Goldfarb said. “We also have a lot of stuff online to educate students, but the bottom line is that everyone has to take responsibility for themselves to understand what to do.”
Despite the large emphasis USC places on this event, it does not detract from the fact that most students, especially those who have never experienced an earthquake, feel unprepared. The University is simply not doing enough.
“I’m kind of scared because I don’t know what to do in the event of an earthquake,” said Archana Yarlagadda, a freshman majoring in health promotion and disease prevention. “It’s an event that happens frequently in California and the campus should prepare students more,” she said.
Yarlagadda is from Birmingham, Ala. and said she was never taught earthquake safety growing up.
More can be done. Similar programs like AlcoholEDU, safety videos and activities should be mandatory for every student, staff and faculty member. Though the campus is structurally sound for a large earthquake, the level of preparedness among students and staff is staggeringly low considering the amount of research and education dedicated to earthquakes on campus. The ShakeOut seems to be the center of earthquake preparedness at USC, but we all know what will happen after Thursday: Everyone will stop caring. 
“If it does happen, we have that level of preparedness,” Goldfarb said. 
Though it is reassuring to know that the school as a whole is prepared, USC takes little measure in making sure that individuals are  well-educated in earthquake safety procedures. Students deserve to feel prepared for natural disasters, and a one-day drill and minimal email is not enough.

Being a public school teacher is hard. It’s one of the lowest-paying jobs in America, most people don’t respect the profession and teachers constantly struggle to secure the resources they need to teach, from pencils to reduced class sizes. It’s no wonder that no one wants to be a teacher anymore. 
For several years now, schools across the country have been facing teacher shortages. Shortages lead to larger class sizes and discourage young people from pursuing the profession. They also mean strong teachers tend to gravitate to wealthier school districts for reasonable pay. But this means low-income students are left with underqualified teachers teaching large classes in communities that need high-quality education the most. 
The required qualifications for teaching can also pose a major barrier for undergraduate students. Though the requirements to become a teacher at the K-12 level vary from state to state, students must generally earn a bachelor’s degree, complete a state-specific teacher education program and teach under supervision. While some schools offer bachelor’s degrees in education that satisfy most of these requirements in four years, most elite higher education institutions — USC, UCLA and Stanford among them — only offer graduate programs in education. 
For students, this means spending another year or two in school and taking out more loans only to enter a profession that pays less per year than what it costs to go to school. The average teacher in California makes about $69,000 per year, and they’re on the upper end of the spectrum; teachers in smaller states like South Dakota make, on average, as little as $39,000 per year. 
Usually, professions that require graduate degrees — such as business, medicine and law — are the some of the highest paid jobs in the country. We can’t expect people to want to teach when they’re asked to do so much for such little reward.
I’ve always wanted to teach at some point in my career — maybe when I retire from journalism — but knowing that I’d have to pay for two years of schooling is discouraging, especially on a journalist’s (also low) salary. 
Another issue with teacher’s wages is that many schools pay their teachers based on student performance. While this seems like a good incentive on the surface, the reality is much more bleak. Standardized tests often don’t adequately represent a teacher’s ability to teach; students have different learning styles and might not perform well on tests despite knowing the material well. Though they claim to be an objective way to measure learning, standardized tests can reflect poorly on teachers who work with disadvantaged students and give an unfair advantage to teachers who work in areas where students are more well-prepared. When pay is purely based on test performance, teachers who work harder to get their students to improve may end up making less than teachers who work with high-acheiving students.
Some say that teaching is a “noble” profession. Teachers are building the next generation of leaders and scholars. But now more than ever, the nobility of teaching has diminished. Teachers are no longer seen as changemakers, or respected for providing one of the most foundational experiences in every child’s life. Without that respect, it’s easy to see why students don’t want to enter the teaching profession.
The public generally recognizes teacher shortages and the causes behind them as an issue. A 2015 EdSource poll of California voters found that 86 percent believed  teacher shortages were a serious issue, and 58 percent believed that teachers in their district were paid too little. 
So at some level, the respect for teaching still exists: People recognize it as a necessity, but they don’t necessarily see themselves or their friends becoming teachers. 
We as Americans must change that narrative, and start incentivizing young people to consider teaching as a viable profession. It starts — like most of the problems I’ve discussed in this column — in the classroom. We need to fund abundant teaching resources in our schools, implement smaller class sizes and ensure that teacher pay is based on experience and improvement rather than standardized test scores. 
We also need to invest in grants and scholarships to allow students to complete teacher education programs without worrying about incurring even more student debt. We need to start encouraging major universities, which already offer graduate programs in education, to use those same resources to offer undergraduates’ degrees in education.
And most importantly, we need to reinstate teaching as a highly respected profession. Teachers change lives every day, and we must start recognizing their work more often. Teaching is a noble profession, so let’s ensure we start seeing it that way again.

While the body love series of events was initially intended to last for only a week, SAGE decided to extend the event to a month. SAGE though it would be a more appropriate length of time to support people’s various identities and promote lasting body image ideals. (Photo courtesy of Gwen Howard)
October is Body Love Month, which is marked by a series of events hosted by the Student Assembly for Gender Empowerment to promote intuitive eating, celebration of individuality and body empowerment. 
The series, which runs from Oct. 2 to Nov. 3, includes a variety of events with different partnerships. Gwen Howard, SAGE Director of Body Love, said that it is important to have a series about body love to enhance student health.
“Eating disorders and poor body image are sort of at an epidemic high among college age students specifically,” said Howard, a junior majoring in popular music performance and choral music. “It’s important to remember how many imposed ideals we have about how we should look like, how we should eat and how we should exercise.” 
One of the upcoming events includes the Body Love Fair at Alumni Park on Thursday. The fair will feature resources to help students foster a healthy relationship between the mind and body. Students will be able to smash scales, participate in crafts, enjoy food and listen to music. 
“[The goal is to] reclaim the power of makeup for one’s own purposes rather than any sort of ideals that are imposed,” said SAGE Executive Co-Director Rosa Wang. 
The pursuit of inclusivity was prioritized when SAGE planned the series, according to Executive Co-Director Anya Kushwaha.
“Historically, we’ve always had things that have been all abilities or all identities welcome,” Kushwaha said. “But now, I’m so happy that we have space specifically for [marginalized groups].”
In addition, SAGE will host its Sephora Bold Beauty Class for Trans and Gender Non-Conforming Folks event on Sunday. This event is an excursion to Sephora for a makeup class that focuses on marginalized identities who may feel excluded from traditional cosmetic use.
The Body Love series was originally planned to be a week long. However, according to Wang, SAGE found it appropriate to expand it to a month in 2015. 
“We realized that a week is not enough. There are so many identities and trying to encompass them into one week, even one month isn’t enough,” Wang said. “We wanted to expand it to try to include all audiences.”
Body Love Month will come to an end on Nov. 3. 
“Body image literacy is what I would love for my peers to have a little bit of experience and practice with,” Howard said. “To start questioning the messages we’re getting and start thinking about things in a more critical way with regards to how we see ourselves and what’s making us see ourselves certain ways.”

The National Academy of Medicine recently elected alumnus and Herman Ostrow School of Dentistry of USC Dean of Research Yang Chai as its newest member. 
NAM is a nonprofit institution that provides advisement in fields of science, technology and health. 
This year, NAM announced the names of 85 new members during its annual meeting held in Washington D.C. on Monday. Of the newly elected members, Chai, who graduated from USC in 1991 with a doctorate in craniofacial biology and in 1996 with a doctorate in dental surgery, is the only NAM professional in the dentistry field, according to USC News.
“You are now part of a group of truly distinguished individuals who have made important contributions to health, science and medicine,” NAM President Victor Dzau said in a notification letter obtained by USC News.
Membership in the Academy is considered one of the most prestigious offers in the medical field.
“This is an incredible recognition by my peers and for the work we do at USC,” Chai told USC News. “But more importantly, this is an opportunity for me to contribute to the advancement of biomedical science at the national and international level.” 
To be eligible for NAM membership, candidates have to demonstrate involvement in health care, disease prevention, education or research, according to the NAM website. In addition, candidates are selected based on professional achievement in the medicine and health fields.
Candidates are also nominated by two current NAM members and must be willing to help NAM in its research.
With the addition of Chai, the University now has nine faculty members who have been elected as NAM members, according to USC News. 
“We are so proud of Yang for this distinction,” Ostrow Dean Avishai Sadan told USC News. “The contributions he has made to the research community here at Ostrow, across the University and for the dental profession are legion. I can’t think of a better way to honor him for a lifetime of scientific achievement.”

Spark SC hosted its biannual startup career fair Wednesday. The event featured small companies to give them a platform apart from the big corporations typically present at recruiting events. (Thomas Forman | Daily Trojan)
Students lined up to enter Alumni Park Wednesday morning to speak to prospective employers at Spark SC’s Startup Career Fair, many of whom were USC alumni. 
The fair featured more than 20 startup companies from the Los Angeles area that promoted internships and full-time positions. 
Spark SC, an organization dedicated to getting students involved in entrepreneurship, put on the biannual fair that included companies from the design, technology, business and medicine fields. 
The lineup included companies like Verkada, a startup that builds enterprise security cameras, and Vezt, the first mobile app that allows music fans to acquire rights to songs and recordings. 
Alyssa Goldberg, a sophomore majoring in arts, technology and the business of innovation, led this year’s startup career fair committee. She said many of the startups looked to hire multiple students — not just one or two, but even up to eight or 10. 
“There are a lot of career fairs that happen on campus, but a lot of them are directed toward a certain major,” Goldberg said. “A lot of the companies at those career fairs are really big, and a lot of the small companies get drowned out.” 
Sina Karachiani, a senior majoring in computer science and music composition, said this was his second year attending the fair. 
“It’s really hard to get to know startups because they’re not as public so there’s not much information about them,” he said. “It’s good to just come see what’s out there. There are a lot of USC alumni so it’s easy to network.” 
Nathan Wallace, a USC alumnus and software engineer at Verkada, said this was the company’s first time at the startup career fair. He said he used to organize the event while attending USC, so he made sure Verkada was present. 
“We’re a relatively new company,” Wallace said. “We closed our Series A round of funding in April, so now we’re looking to grow and expand.” 
Kerri Ma, a sophomore majoring in business administration, said her goal was to learn about companies she’s never heard about. 
“I want to learn more about what startups have to offer … and see how they differ from larger corporations in how they construct their business and the types of careers they seek,” she said. 
As someone who currently works at a startup, Goldberg said she sees the value in the experience. 
“You can really see the impact that you’re having,” Goldberg said. “At a lot of big companies, that often gets lost in the hierarchy … There are so many people working on one thing.”

Phi Sigma Kappa was notified of its suspension by a letter from the Vice Provost of Student Affairs on Oct. 5. It said it has not received explanation from USC despite reaching out multiple times. (Dimple Sarnaaik | Daily Trojan)
Phi Sigma Kappa Fraternity filed a complaint Thursday against USC regarding its sudden interim suspension for alleged hazing over a week ago. The fraternity is calling the University’s actions a violation of California law and USC policy. 
Phi Sigma Kappa alleged that the University suspended its activities without warning and without providing a reason or a hearing. The fraternity asked the court to order USC to lift the suspension and allow the fraternity to resume activities until the University discloses the allegations and gives the fraternity a fair hearing.
“We still haven’t had any formal response from the University,” Phi Sigma Kappa President Bradley Billig said. “We’ve sent them multiple letters, multiple court documents at this point … We’ve reached out so many times.”
The University is currently evaluating the hazing allegations.
“USC takes allegations of hazing very seriously and is investigating,” the University said in a statement to the Daily Trojan. “Organizations that are being investigated for alleged violations of the code of conduct can be instructed to suspend or modify social activities pending results of an investigation.”
The California Code of Civil Procedure states that holding a fair hearing and factual basis for punishment is required, which Phi Sigma Kappa claims it did not receive from the University, according to the complaint. 
Additionally, USC policy states that an organization may be suspended if a hazing allegation is proven. The policy requires written notice through email detailing the allegation and the reasoning behind the charge.
The memorandum from the fraternity said they never received any information regarding the hazing allegations, and explained that the suspension has tarnished the organization’s reputation.
“USC accused and punished PSK, and made such accusation and punishment public, without so much as informing PSK why it was being punished,” the lawsuit stated.
 Phi Sigma Kappa leadership said it interviewed the fraternity’s head of new member induction as well as this year’s pledge class and asked its members if they were aware of any hazing, but did not find evidence of such behavior.
“We’ve instructed all of our new members and incumbent members to be fully cooperative with SJACS if they’re ever called in for a witness testimony or anything like that,” Billig said. “We told them to be as honest as possible and to comply because we don’t want to make this hostile.” 
Phi Sigma Kappa said it has a Judicial Board for students to anonymously report conduct, but has received no hazing complaints, according to the lawsuit.
The fraternity was notified about the suspension through a letter from Student Affairs on Oct. 5 after it was informed by the office of Fraternity and Sorority Leadership Development to cancel an event it had planned to hold that night. The event had originally been approved by the FSLD.
“The Suspension Letter offered no basis for the suspension other than the vaguest terms: ‘Reports of alleged behaviors that may have endangered the university community,’” the complaint read.
Three fraternity members, including some executive members, visited the office of Student Judicial Affairs and Community Standards Oct. 8, but were not provided with information regarding the suspension because of the ongoing investigation.
The fraternity will appear in court Dec. 7.
