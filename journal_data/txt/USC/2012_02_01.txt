After breaking the three-game losing streak with a win against UC Santa Barbara on Tuesday, the USC Women of Troy are looking to set a winning trend for February.
Making their case · The Women of Troy currently sit in fourth place in the Pac-12. A victory against the Cougars could propel them into second. - Corey Marquetti | Daily Trojan
USC (11-9, 5-4) will have a chance to win its second game in a row against Washington State (10-11, 4-5) USC’s victory over Santa Barbara ended a skid that began with an overtime loss against Oregon State on Jan. 21.
Washington State averages 62.5 points per game behind guard Jazmine Perkins’ nine points and 7.6 rebounds per contest. They are 3-5 in road contests, while the Women of Troy are 5-2 playing at the Galen Center.
The Cougars will enter the matchup against USC after defeating Arizona 78-68 Saturday. Before the home victory, the Cougars had lost five games in a row.
The Women of Troy hope to carry their momentum from their 11-point win against the Gauchos. In the game, USC sophomore forward Cassie Harberts scored a game-high 17 points, including 10 of USC’s first 17 points.
USC freshman forward Alexyz Vaioletama also stepped up by grabbing a career-high 15 rebounds amid the absence of senior guard Briana Gilbreath. The team’s leader in blocks and steals sat out for the second game in a row to nurse an injured knee, and she hopes to rejoin the team Thursday.
Even without Gilbreath, USC was able to hold UCSB to a dismal 25.4 percent shooting effort for the game.
Late game defense has been a concern for the Women of Troy, whose three consecutive losses in January came by eight points or less.
“We still have a lot of stuff to work on, but we definitely turned a huge corner from those three losses,” Harberts said.
Before its three-game skid, USC stood at second in the conference behind No. 4 Stanford because of a five-game winning streak that began with a 20-point victory over third-place California.
“I think we found our identity, and we know who we are. But we have some ups and downs,” USC coach Michael Cooper said. “We have to stop the roller coaster ride and become a little more consistent.”
Now at fourth in the conference, USC looks to finish strong before the Pac-12 Tournament in March.
“Sometimes it’s not how you start — it’s how you finish,” Cooper said. “Hopefully we’ll finish with a bang.”
Tip-off is 7 p.m. Thursday at the Galen Center.

Whatever problem UC Santa Barbara had proven to be recently to the No. 2 USC men’s volleyball team was dealt with swiftly Wednesday night at Galen Center as the Trojans (5-3, 4-3) dispatched of Gauchos (2-6, 0-4) in three sets, 25-16, 25-14, 25-21.
Last season, the Gauchos eliminated USC from both the Mountain Pacific Sports Federation playoffs and the NCAA tournament. But after UCSB graduated six of seven starters from last year’s national runner-up squad, the Trojans were faced with a much different Gaucho attack Wednesday. The opportunity for some payback, however, did motivate some of the Trojans heading into Wednesday.
“We didn’t talk about [it as a team], but I know our guys had said something about it earlier this week,” USC coach Bill Ferguson said.
Senior outside hitter Tony Ciarelli helped to make sure USC didn’t fall three times in a row to the Gauchos  by finishing with 11 kills on a .400 hitting percentage and two service aces.
Despite holding just one full practice this week before Wednesday’s contest because of a tightly packed conference schedule, the Trojans came out firing early. Ciarelli and redshirt sophomore opposite hitter Taylor Jansen each recorded four kills in the first frame, as UCSB never threatened after keeping it close in the early part of the set despite a visibly energetic Gaucho attack.
“They caused a little trouble for us, especially on the right side and that opened up their offense a little bit,” Ferguson said.
UCSB middle blocker Dylan Davis, who Ferguson had keyed earlier in the week, was held mostly in check on the night, finishing with a -.076 hitting percentage.
Seemingly at ease following a more back-and-forth first set, Jensen and redshirt junior outside hitter Jeff Carlson combined for six kills in the second set to pace USC as the Trojans easily took the set.
UCSB outside hitter Blaine Nielsen tried to keep the Gauchos in the second set, recording two key blocks in a set where UCSB recorded just seven points as a result of their own attack.
The Gauchos continued to fight late in the set, as a long rally with UCSB down 11 sent both teams scrambling around Galen Center, but as most of the rallies in the set did, USC came away with the point, clinching the set three points later.
The third set proved the toughest battle between the squads on the night, as Ferguson called two timeouts late in the frame that seemed to momentarily put USC back on track, but the Gauchos continued to hang around.
“I told the guys before the third set, the toughest thing for you guys to do is going to be for you to maintain [the] high level of play,” Ferguson said.
The Trojans will hit the court Friday as they welcome UCLA to the Galen Center. The Bruins (10-1, 5-0) dropped their first set in more than seven matches Wednesday night to Pepperdine, but will come into the meeting on an eight-game winning streak.
First serve is set for 7 p.m.

For a lot of college football fans, Wednesday was the beginning of a new season. Yes, signing day often signifies the start of greatness or the start of a downward trend for teams, whether they play in the SEC, the Big-10 or the Pac-12.
Signing day has become a nationwide phenomenon. ESPNU started its coverage at 6 a.m. and went the entire day. Fans eagerly waited to hear which blue-chip recruits would attend their favorite universities, and the pundits projected which players will make their impact when they first step on the field.
But such was not the case for USC. No, I do not expect much out of the highly regarded freshmen that will be arriving on campus in the coming months. Sure, there will be contributors, but I do not think there will be any game changers.
That is not to say that these players lack talent; they certainly have a brilliant crop of players that look as if they will be stars sooner rather than later. The Trojans, however, have a serious problem.
They have too much talent that has been on campus for at least a calendar year.
They are returning 17 starters, among them junior quarterback Matt Barkley, sophomore receiver Robert Woods, cornerback Nickell Robey and freshman middle linebacker Lamar Dawson. The only area where the team lacks depth is in the receiver position, as Brice Butler and Kyle Prater have transferred, and Brandon Carswell will have graduated. But the Trojans still have last year’s top receiving prospect, George Farmer, waiting in the wings to emerge as the team’s third receiver.
USC is set for most defensive positions, except for defensive tackle, where there is not a vast amount of experience returning. Linebacker and defensive end are deep positions, as is corner and safety. On offense, every offensive lineman but Matt Kalil returns, and the only other starter not returning is fullback Rhett Ellison.
This is a team that has national championship aspirations because of the players that are proven commodities — not because of who they have coming in on the ESPNU 150 recruiting board. This edition of the Trojans will look similar to the 2011 edition; in fact, do not expect many changes among the stat leaders.
Though a great recruiting class is always a positive, it will not have a major effect on this year’s team; it can’t. USC’s last few recruiting classes were too good.
Players from this year’s class could very well become all-time Trojan greats; in fact, it wouldn’t surprise me. But the fact of the matter is USC has set playmakers all over the field. It’s a problem many coaches would love to have.
The Trojans are a preseason top five-team because they are established. The same players who accounted for 50 points against UCLA are all back for the most part.
That team that took out Oregon at Autzen Stadium? Yeah, most of them are back too.
Signing day is incredibly important—don’t get me wrong. But for the 2012-2013 edition of the Trojans, it will not matter nearly as much as it will for other teams in the country. Teams like Alabama, LSU and Oregon will be breaking in starters at key positions, whether it’s quarterback, tailback or linebacker. USC, however, will not be one of the teams putting the pieces together with true freshmen. Instead, they will be relying on the savvy veterans that helped them get to 10-2 and a first-place finish in the Pac-12 South Division.
Lane Kiffin’s third recruiting class will have its share of contributors somewhere down the line. But 2012 USC does not need to — and frankly can’t afford to — depend on true freshmen this coming season. No, the Trojan’s ascent to the top of the college football mountain will be due in large part to its sophomores, juniors and seniors.
The Trojans do not have time to break in players; they are one of the top teams in the country because of who they return from last season.

For nine straight games, the USC men’s basketball team failed to produce a single win. Then, on Jan. 28, they put an end to what had been a long losing streak while simultaneously picking up their first Pac-12 victory by defeating the Utah Utes, 62-45.
Momentum swing · Coming off their first conference victory, the Trojans look to finish the season strong against Washington State. - Luciano Nunez | Daily Trojan
“It was nice getting the monkey off of our back,” junior center James Blasczyk said. “It shows us that we can win if we play hard.”
Now the Trojans will have a chance to do something they haven’t accomplished since Nov. 30: win back-to-back games.
On Thursday night, USC will take on the Washington State Cougars at the Wallis Beasley Performing Arts Coliseum in Pullman, Wash. The Cougars (11-10, 3-6) have been nearly unbeatable at home, touting an 8-1 record.
They’re averaging 71 points per contest while sporting a 47.2 field goal percentage, ranked No. 48 in the country. USC coach Kevin O’Neill knows his team faces an uphill battle as it travels to the Pacific Northwest.
“What we have to do is play our best game on the defensive end and give ourselves a chance to score offensively by not turning the ball over,” O’Neill said.
The Trojans will try to slow down center Washington State Brock Motum, who is averaging 16.4 points and 6.5 rebounds and most recently put up a career-high 34 points in a 71-67 loss against Arizona State.
“We’re going to have to front his post-ups,” O’Neill said. “He’s also a good outside player and he shoots the ball well. He’s a guy who has developed into a real pro in the last year. Last year he wasn’t a guy that was even a big part of their offense but he’s very talented.”
One of the players who will be responsible for guarding Motum, Blasczyk, is the only true center remaining in the rotation. Blasczyk has been slowed down by a ligament injury in his foot.
“Basketball-wise, it’s pretty difficult, but I always feel like my motor is going,” Blasczyk said. “I have a lot more responsibility but I don’t really feel it. I just feel like going out there and playing basketball.”
Against the Utes, USC benefited from sophomore guard Maurice Jones and sophomore forward Garrett Jackson’s combined 32 points. The Trojans will need more of the same against the Cougars, especially with a depleted roster lacking depth due to injuries.
“With what we’re down to on our roster, with six scholarship players and four of our starters from the beginning of the [season] out for the year, it’s going to be a challenge,” O’Neill said.
Following Thursday’s game, which is set to tip-off at 7:05 P.M. and can be heard on 710 AM ESPN Radio, the Trojans will finish up a two-game set in Washington by taking on the Huskies (14-7, 7-2) on Saturday. For now, O’Neill is satisfied with his team’s preparations leading up to their next few contests.
“I thought the guys have been good,” O’Neill said. “They’ve been good coming off losses, coming off the win on Saturday. They’ve practiced hard, they’ve done their job, and I can’t ask much more of them than that.”

On Wednesday, USC coach Lane Kiffin announced the newest football recruiting class to join the Trojan ranks at a press conference in Heritage Hall as the period for high school seniors to sign letters of intent opened.
The group, ranked eighth nationally by Rivals.com, includes 11 high school players and one junior college transfer. The scholarship reductions imposed by the NCAA went into effect with the 2012 recruiting class, and the Trojans were only allowed to sign a maximum of 15 players.
Number crunching · The Trojans signed 12 players in their 2012 recruiting class, many of which were highly sought-after players. They are only allowed to carry 75 players on their team for the next three seasons. - Chris Pham | Daily Trojan
 
“It’s tough because that’s 10 players you are giving away to your competitors,” Kiffin said.
Despite the sanctions, Kiffin appeared pleased with the class.
“We can’t control how many we sign, but we can control who we sign — And these are the highest quality players.”
Notably, Lane Kiffin and his staff stockpiled talent at the offensive line position by signing five-star prospects Zach Banner of Lakewood, Wash. and Jordan Simmons of Encino, Calif.  Though the incoming freshmen bring size and athleticism, Kiffin did not expect them to emerge as the replacements for Matt Kalil, who is the lone starter not returning to an offensive line that surrendered only eight sacks last year.
“It’s so hard at [offensive line] to go from high school to college. Luckily ,we do return four of our five,” Kiffin said.
At wide receiver, the Trojans added four-star Darreus Rogers of Carson, Calif. and highly touted wide receiver Nelson Agholor of Tampa Bay, Fla.
Though USC filled several areas of need, the lack of depth at running back continues to be an issue. Jahleel Pinner is listed at running back at five-foot-eleven, 250 pounds, but he projects to be a fullback.
“It was just one of those years where we just didn’t find any guys we liked [at running back],” Kiffin said. “If we were able to sign more guys, we would have been able to take a chance.”
The Trojans managed to sign defensive recruits Wednesday as well.
Safety Gerald Bowman, the lone junior college transfer who was the top prospect at his position, officially signed with USC. The Trojans hoped to sign him as an early enrollee for spring practice, but he was unable to get through the process in time.
At linebacker, four-star Jabari Ruffin of Downey, Calif., signed his letter of intent to join spring enrollee Scott Starr at the position. USC started three freshmen at linebacker a year ago, Ruffin and Starr could see the field right away.
“[Ruffin and Starr] are as good as anybody we saw in camp.” Kiffin said. They reminded us of the old days.”
Defensive backs Kevon Seymour of Pasadena, Calif., and Devian Shelton of Inglewood, Calif., join a secondary that returns the top-two lines of the depth chart from a year ago.
The biggest signing of the day came by way of Daytona Beach, Fla. The Trojans needed to address a need along the defensive line, and they found their man in Leonard Williams. The four-star prospect projects as a defensive end and Kiffin believes he is the most likely recruit in the class to have an immediate impact.
With the majority of last year’s roster returning, Kiffin does not believe there is as much pressure on the 2012 class to perform right away.
“A year ago we probably had more holes to fill immediately.” Kiffin said. “We don’t need them to be great right away.”

Experts discussed health care at USC and how recent legislation could affect students at a panel hosted by the Graduate Student Government on Wednesday.
According to Dr. Larry Neinstein, executive director of the University Park Health Center and associate dean of student affairs, total visits to the health center each year have risen from 30,000 in 1995 to 90,000. The number of students insured by USC has also risen from 3,000 students in 1995 to 22,000.
Expansion · Dr. Larry Neinstein, executive director of the University Park Health Center, said USC wants to expand insured dental services. - Chris Roman | Daily Trojan
The new health center facility is expected to open next January, allowing all health care services to be located in the same vicinity.
“Having that new building will really help. Right now, all the medical services are all over the place, and it’s confusing,” said Adriana Ardy, a graduate student studying public health.
Neinstein said the health canter provides a number of services for students, including unlimited primary and urgent care, labs, radiology, physical therapy, specialty clinics, health promotion and counseling.
Rynicia Wilson, a graduate student studying law, said the health center could better inform students about these services.
“It would help to make students aware of what benefits [they are] entitled to,” Wilson said. “The only reason I know about them is because I was an undergrad here. I just know that as a grad student, I get a bill that says health insurance, and I pay it.”
Students at the event also said university dental care was not comprehensive enough. Neinstein said the university is hoping to increase dental benefits to those with USC health insurance next year.
Paula Swinford, director of the Office for Wellness and Health Promotion, also emphasized a new initiative, Be Well USC, which was introduced in April 2011. The campaign focuses on wellness, health promotion and prevention.
[Correction: A previous version of this article said Paula Swinford is the director of Health Promotion and Disease Prevention, an academic department. She is the director of the Office of Wellness and Health Promotion. The Daily Trojan regrets the error.]
“The program is really a collaborative effort,” Swinford said. “There are things that have nothing to do with health care that will determine whether or not you are healthy.”
Panelists addressed how students will be affected by the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, the health care act signed by Obama in March 2010. Under the new law, young adults will be able to stay on a parent’s health insurance roughly until the age of 26.
“This is a very important provision because if you look at the data, the highest percentage [of uninsured people] are in the young adult category, and you can imagine why,” said Dr. Michael Cousineau, director for the center of community health studies. “Students graduate, get their degrees, they’re going to be competing, they might not get a job right away in this economy. If they have to pay for a plan themselves, they are not going to want to shell out $300 a month when they’re trying to get their feet on the ground.”
Also, the advent of the Health Benefit Exchange, an online government program that is part of the PPACA and is still under construction, would allow for businesses to easily provide health insurance for employees. An  easier method of selecting health care plans could benefit students entering the workforce, Cousineau said.

Jackson discussed his belief that each event in our lives is “magical, mystical and part of a divine plan” that shapes our personalities.
Leader · Michael Jackson, vice president for student affairs, spoke about his activism during his time at a Calif. boarding school and Stanford University. - Corey Marquetti | Daily Trojan
For Jackson, one of these “magical” events was his experience as the first black student to attend Stevenson School in Pebble Beach, Calif. When the boarding school began looking to integrate in the 1960s, a family friend offered Jackson the chance to enroll.
Jackson continued to make waves after his enrollment as well.
As a 15-year-old, Jackson wrote a letter to the student body and faculty objecting to a tradition called “Slave Day,” where seniors could buy younger students for the day. Soon after, the school discontinued the activity.
He said this was the first moment he realized the impact he could have on others.
“I began to get this image of myself as the hub in the middle of a wheel,” Jackson said. “I would be helping people in all kinds of different ways and they would come in and out of my life and I would be in and out of their lives, but I would be a connection point for folks.”
Jackson also spoke of his undergraduate years at Stanford, where he said he had to learn to “know himself.”
He described one conflict he had with the Black Student Union — instead of hanging out only with other black students in the club, Jackson said he became friends with people of all backgrounds.
“I knew I had to be my own person and develop relationships that were important to me, regardless of race, ethnicity or gender,” Jackson said.
These experiences in his young adult life propelled Jackson into focusing on what he calls “spiritual leadership.”
Jackson said once he began to understand the impact he could have on other people, he learned to focus on maintaining mental clarity and humility to get things done. Jackson cited the 13 years he spent working to build the Ronald Tutor Campus Center as an example of this leadership style.
“We could have never done that as a collective if we put our egos in front and made it about us,” Jackson said. “We were focused on the higher result. We tried to have sharp elbows to ensure that we fulfilled our vision for what that center could become.”
Finally, Jackson spoke of love as the driving force behind all his work.
“Let’s talk about love — I can’t live without it. I love each of you, I love my wife, I love my family,” Jackson said. “I think part of God’s plan is that this wonderful word called love gets actualized in the way we are a community for one another.”
Though he acknowledged love can come in many different forms, Jackson said he believes trying to find love in everything is the thread connecting every piece of his life.
“How I go about spreading this love is the work I do in this role as a Vice President for Student Affairs at USC,” Jackson said. “I work with the goal of providing environments that allow others to thrive and fulfill their dreams and their hopes so they can go out and spread peace and love.”
As vice president for student affairs, Jackson’s department oversees the Office of Student Publications, which includes the Daily Trojan.

A group of local activists gathered to voice their concerns over the delay of the low-income Bethune Crossroads housing project on Vermont Avenue near USC on Wednesday.
The project lays out plans for a 55-unit complex to be built on an empty lot on Vermont between 36th Place and 37th Street. The site is directly south of St. Mark’s Evangelical Lutheran Church.
Many activists at the rally were members of TRUST South LA — Tenemos Que Reclamar Y Unidos Salvar La Tierra (Together We Must Reclaim and Save the Land) — and are putting pressure on state legislators and Gov. Jerry Brown to continue funding projects, such as the Bethune Crossroads project.
The group fears that the state-owned land will be auctioned off and sold to student housing developers — an increasingly common occurrence on the west side of campus, according to a survey conducted by United Neighbors In Defense Against Displacement of Los Angeles.
“This community is being absorbed like a virus by USC,” said Brent Blair, director of Applied Theatre Arts at USC.
Blair has taught at USC for 18 years and has lived on the west side for three years. He said community members have been directly displaced by students moving into west side housing.
More than 90 percent of the housing on 36th Place between Vermont and Budlong avenues was community-serving housing in 1999, according to UNIDAD’s survey.
UNIDAD conducted the same survey 10 years later and found that 25 percent of housing remained community-serving as 75 percent had been developed into non-university-owned student housing.
“This is the community’s land,” said Rosa Giron, a TRUST volunteer and St. Mark’s member. “Why can’t students and families co-exist?”
In 2011, the Community Redevelopment Agency of Los Angeles and the L.A. City Council gave the preliminary go-ahead for the Bethune Crossroads project, named after the now-demolished Bethune Library, which once occupied the vacant plot of land. The CRA/LA was set to put up $3 million to help fund the low-income housing project.
But funding for the CRA/LA — and similar state agencies — was cut after the California State Supreme Court upheld a controversial bill that was passed as a part of Brown’s 2011-2012 budget proposal. The law eliminated more than 400 local redevelopment agencies in California and jeopardized numerous projects, including Bethune Crossroads.
Sandra McNeill, executive director of TRUST, spoke at a press conference before the group’s rally. McNeill stressed the need for the completion of projects by the state and how the development will have a lasting effect.
“Any cut they make will cause this community to bleed,” McNeill said. “However, as a community, we must critique the actions which the state has taken that have resulted … in denying our ability to advance a long-term vision for a healthy, safe and vibrant community.”
The CRA/LA handed over its current backlog of projects to a successor agency on Wednesday. The successor agency has until June to decide on a limited number of projects to undertake.
Alfredo Avila, a graduate student in the Applied Theatre Arts program, said he is concerned with the state potentially cutting direct funding to USC-area community redevelopments, which would pave the way for more student housing.
“[Building more student housing is] not a horrible thing,” Avila said. “But students are only here temporarily.”
USC does not own university housing on the west side of campus, but David Galaviz, executive director of local government relations for the university, said the school is in favor of community development in neighboring areas.
“The university definitely supports efforts to improve the lives of the surrounding community [members],” Galaviz said.

Many members of the local South Los Angeles community see USC’s quest to obtain total operational control of the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum as beneficial to the surrounding area, according to public comments made before Wednesday’s planned Coliseum Commission meeting.
USC and the Coliseum Commission, the stadium’s nine-member governing body, have been in negotiations since September to modify the existing lease agreement, enacted in 2008.
Last month, the commission, along with USC, released through its website a list of terms that outline various modifications.
Thus far, many have been receptive to the idea of USC obtaining the “master lease” and control of the historic venue.
“Please allow USC to transform this facility,” said Robert C. Joyner, the Coliseum’s project manager, during the public comment portion. The meeting was eventually canceled after failing to provide the public sufficient notice as to the scheduled date.
Under the 16-page terms sheet released on Jan. 11, USC would have the exclusive right to manage the Coliseum, the adjacent Los Angeles Sports Arena and other facilities in surrounding Exposition Park.
“It’s a fantastic thing, USC managing the Coliseum,” said Charmaine Jefferson, executive director for the California African American Museum. “They probably have one of the strongest vested interests in making this historic place the best that it can be.”
USC would be responsible for renovating the stadium, which hosts six to seven football games each year, by Dec. 31, 2021.
“USC encourages a sense of camaraderie, and nowhere else can you experience that feeling than through the tradition of USC football,” said Undergraduate Student Government President Monish Tyagi. “Saturdays we can all come together at the Coliseum.”
How the stadium is eventually renovated has remained a point of contention over the last year. In June, the commission acknowledged it would be unable to make the nearly $60 million needed for renovations, prompting USC to seek day-to-day control of the 88-year-old facility.
USC Senior Vice President for University Relations Tom Sayles told the Daily Trojan last month that the school would be willing to fund the needed repairs.
U.S. Capital, LLC, a San Diego-based sports and entertainment company, has insisted the commission has not afforded other interested groups the opportunity to bid on a contract to manage the Coliseum. The group, along with its equity partners, said it would be able to fund the renovations without any federal, state or local aid if given the chance.
“We want to build a new Coliseum with our money and with support from USC,” U.S. Capital LLC Executive Vice President Linda Paul said. “We would work with USC. Everything they’ve requested in the past will be be built for them new.”
Because of the school’s history and involvement in the surrounding area, though, some continue to see USC as the logical fit to take control of the stadium in the coming years. The USC football team has been a tenant at the venue since 1923.
“The Coliseum has become a symbol of USC and of USC’s athletic department,” said Zachary Goodman, a freshman majoring in business administration. “They have the money to spend on the renovations, and I’m sure they wouldn’t do anything short of amazing.”

24-Hour Musical
Sunday, UCLA Ackerman Grand Ballroom, 8 p.m.
Usually, theater shows take months to prepare. Actors must memorize lines, the stage blocking must be choreographed, the set must be built and the list goes on and on.
So what happens when you give a cast and crew exactly 24 hours to complete a production from start to finish?
You can find out this Sunday when the Hooligan Theatre Company and UCLA’s ACT III Theatre Ensemble put on the 24-Hour Musical. The show abides by a few specific rules: The musical chosen must be well-known, fun and have a big cast, and the cast and crew must not know anything until exactly 8 p.m. the night before.
It’s a formula that should lead to a lot of laughs, both purposeful and unintended. And though the show is in enemy territory, the 24-Hour Musical looks to be a great, lighthearted way to round out your weekend — and it benefits No Limits, a local charity that empowers hearing-impaired children through theater.
Star Wars: Where Science Meets Imagination
Ongoing Exhibition, Ends April 15
Between the 3-D re-release of The Phantom Menace and the highly anticipated Volkswagen Star Wars-themed Superbowl commercial (cue “the barkside”), Star Wars fever is catching on.
Star Wars: Where Science Meets Imagination is a testament to the enduring legacy of George Lucas’ brainchild.
The scientific exhibition poses the question as to whether these fantastical technologies could exist in the real world. Specifically it delves into humanoid robots, landspeeders and X-wing Starfighters, oh my!
Additionally, the exhibition allots audience participation with a vast assortment of interactive activities. You can experiment with robotics, try your hand at steering a hovercraft, witness costumes and props from the epic series itself and play with droid and landspeeder technology.
Star Wars: Where Science Meets Imagination is now on display at the Discovery Science Center in Santa Ana (a bit of a trek but well worth the drive) and tickets cost around $15.
Pay tribute to one of USC’s most prestigious alums and explore this fascinating, interactive and intergalactic world.
The Loved One screening
Saturday, Egyptian Theatre, 7:30 p.m.
When it was first released in October 1965, The Loved One claimed to be “the motion picture with something to offend everyone.” If you’re into some seriously black humor, this rare screening at the Egyptian Theatre should be the perfect Saturday evening event to attend.
Based on a satirical 1948 short novel, The Loved One takes a hilariously off-color look at the funeral business in Los Angeles. The story follows young Englishman Dennis Barlow (played by theater and film vet Robert Morse, now on Mad Men), who flies to the United States to visit his Hollywood-based uncle, Sir Francis Hinsley (John Gielgud).
Things go awry when Hinsley is suddenly fired: he commits suicide, and Barlow is left to — figuratively — clean up the mess.
The screening is followed by a moderated discussion with Morse, cinematographer Haskell Wexler and others; admission is $11.
George Harrison: Living in the Material World
Ongoing Exhibition, Ends March 25
Any Beatles fans out there?
The Grammy Museum’s exhibition, George Harrison: Living in the Material World, offers you the opportunity to reclaim a piece of your favorite foursome.
The museum, which recently showcased the talented and popularly acclaimed Bob Marley, pays tribute to one of music’s greatest contributors. The exhibition includes a mélange of rare photographs and footage available for public viewing.
A range of items from Harrison’s personal collection will be on display: Harrison’s guitars used during his career as a Beatle and a soloist, costumes, pictures (shot by Harrison himself) and handwritten lyrics of “While My Guitar Gently Weeps” and “Living in the Material World.”
Tickets run for $12.95 and the exhibition was extended through Mar. 25 due to popular demand — evidently it’s a must-see.
George Harrison: Living in the Material World provides a comprehensive, in-depth look into Harrison’s creative life. Don’t miss out “Because” there’s definitely “Something” special about “This Boy” and this exhibition.

It might seem like superheroes are dominating comic books more than ever. DC and Marvel are benefitting from big-budget adaptations, and DC just had a fresh relaunch of its main superhero-focused line, New 52, and Dynamite Comics is focusing on classic pulp stars like The Shadow and Zorro. The genre that has truly been reborn in recent years, however, is horror.
Horror has been a major part of comic books since their start in the 1930s. They were extremely popular throughout the 1940s and early ’50s, until Dr. Frederic Wertham’s The Seduction of the Innocent — the book that called Superman un-American — led to the Comics Code, which was enacted by the Comics Code Authority. The Comics Code promoted self-regulation of works and the censorship of the horror genre and its related creatures, storylines and tone, adding to other clampdowns on the comic book industry.
Horror comics often offer societal critiques and this, in part, contributes to the scrutiny they receive. Beyond the thrills and chills, horror comics often tackle issues and concepts that more mainstream genres like westerns and superhero adventures do not. Many tales are metaphors and allegories for racial and gender issues, such as the EC Comics series Shock SuspenStories, which dealt with themes of drugs and racism, and the stories are far more developed than those of other genres.
After more than a decade of being pushed aside by the Comics Code, the genre re-emerged in the 1970s and 1980s with a renewed vigor and purpose. Spurred by a new focus on social issues, horror series took these issues to more radical extremes. During this time, some of the biggest horror titles, including Swamp Thing and Hellblazer, emerged. Many of these series were written by British authors in response to the growing political right in the United Kingdom, which in turn heightened xenophobia.
But after that re-emergence, horror found itself moved out of the mainstream and pushed into the corners. Companies thought these titles were too activist and frightening for casual readers, and they thought it would be easier to capitalize on horror’s success by putting it in a specific market. This is how things such as DC’s Vertigo imprint emerged. And that’s how horror stayed mostly pushed to limited markets or the independent comic scene.
Now horror is back, and in a big way. It started midway through the last decade. At Image Comics, Robert Kirkman’s The Walking Dead kicked off the modern zombie craze in comics, using zombies to examine human thinking under intense situations. At IDW Publishing, Joe Hill’s Locke and Key mixes family relations with a scary mystery to craft a modern epic. And the Dark Horse Hellboy franchise, around since the 1990s, grew heavily, with a number of spinoff horror miniseries under the Bureau for Paranormal Research and Defense title, as well as a saga for the titular devil himself.
As part of its New 52 relaunch, DC is integrating many Vertigo characters and elements into its main arc. Under the banner of “The Dark,” horror stories are back. John Constantine and Shade the Changing Man are a part of the I, Vampire series, which appears to be one of the many Twilight copycats out there as indicated by its cover, but instead turned out to be an incredibly creepy, Gothic title. It’s an all-ages alternative to the more intrigue-focused Vertigo series American Vampire.
So why is there such a resurgence? It might be an attempt to diversify some markets — DC also revived a Western and war series as well — but it probably goes back to the appeal of horror as a genre in the first place, a way to tackle tougher issues through allegorical elements.
For instance, Scott Snyder’s relaunch of Swamp Thing, aside from creepy elements, deals heavily with environmental themes and the effects of humanity on nature; it’s kind of a “green horror” series. It’s not blunt, but it manages to address the topic by using the story to serve its purpose, rather than sacrifice any frights.
Comics have a great ability to tell stories — the only limitation is the talent and creativity of writers and artists. That means horror stories can be wickedly clever and spooky. And writers today are using the genre as a way to examine the human condition in interesting ways.
This makes horror comics some of the most compelling books on the shelves these days. And there are more than a few frights.

Selling out just 36 hours after reservations opened, Cardinal Theatre Productions’ presentation of the rock musical Spring Awakening had to meet some pretty big expectations. After all, the original Broadway production of Spring Awakening was nominated for 11 Tony Awards and won a Grammy for best musical show album.
The Cardinal Theatre Productions’ version of the show doesn’t disappoint.
Touch me · USC’s reproduction of the Tony award-winning musical, Spring Awakening, stands apart as a dynamic work. The talented cast brings difficult subject matter to life, blowing audiences away. - Matthew Wunderlich | Daily Trojan
Based on Frank Wedekind’s play Spring’s Awakening, the musical follows classmates Melchior, Moritz, Wendla and Ilse as they confront the challenges of adolescence and approaching adulthood in 19th-century Germany.
Slideshow: More Spring Awakening photos>>
The musical is not for the squeamish or narrow-minded. The show is known for graphically confronting issues of sex, suicide, homosexuality, abuse and other societal taboos that young people confront on a daily basis. The explicit language and nudity have been known to drive away older audiences and shock those who don’t know what to expect from a musical with a seemingly innocuous title.
Fittingly, the Cardinal Theatre Productions version does shock, but in a good way.
Featuring an extremely talented and diverse cast and crew, the production proves that you don’t have to be an established pro to blow your audience away. Freshman Kevin Herald steals the show as the adorably awkward Moritz, whose attempts to advance in society are confounded by his struggles with the opposite sex and his inability to perform well in school.
Herald’s imperfect but raw, achy voice meshes well with the musical’s rock score, and his acting knowingly balances the poignant and the comical, demonstrating a deep connection with the character of Moritz.
Freshman Kyle McLaughlin plays Melchior Gabor, whose actions drive much of the play. A free-thinking intellectual struggling to survive in such a confined society, Melchior challenges the religious and political ideals of late-19th-century Germany and often finds himself punished for it.
McLaughlin’s versatile voice captures the essence of the conflicted character. He angrily joins in upbeat numbers like “Bitch of Living” and “Totally F-cked” but also slows down and enchants with “The Mirror-Blue Night” and “Left Behind.”
Sophomore Brenna Bloom’s Ilse is equally memorable. Bloom’s warm, bell-like alto has a way of ringing through the Massman and lingering in your ears long after the last note is finished. Her brilliant use of facial expressions make it easy to see why she was cast for such a dark character.
Freshman Jenna Bamberger as Wendla, the other female lead, dazzles with her heartfelt rendition of “Whispering,” and her acting in Wendla’s darker and more explicit scenes never falters. She demonstrates admirable maturity for such a young actress.
Several minor characters are just as brilliant. As the character of ”Adult Male,” junior Brandon Rachal internally switches between roles just as easily and efficiently as changing his tie, and freshman Nathan Fertig’s Georg is hilarious, believable and vocally haunting all at once.
But the talented crew all but upstages the actors.
Designer Manuel Prieto’s lighting, costume and set design are innovative even as they pay homage to the original production. Fans of the Broadway run will remember the shifting red and blue lights, old-fashioned, navy blue schoolboy uniforms and traditional Moritz hair swoop, but the show adds so much more.
The swaying hayloft of “I Believe” is replaced with a clever two-story stage upon which the orchestra also plays. Addtionally, the show ditches the girls’ prim, drab dresses and substitutes modern Catholic schoolgirl uniforms, which reveal a slight hint of sensuality and appropriately highlight the characters’ desires for the opposite sex.
The lighting stands out the most: Prieto makes sure to use it to change scenes, to illustrate mood and to suggest alternate realities. His best work is undoubtedly in “Don’t Do Sadness,” where red and blue lights trade sides of the stage as they follow their prospective characters. The lighting of Spring Awakening tells just as much of the story as the script.
Director Maddy Heyman and choreographers Kelly Ciurczak and Janelle Mamminni demonstrate their deep understanding of movement and placement on the stage. Though the original Broadway Spring Awakening becomes somewhat static at times, Heyman keeps her actors moving perfectly in “All That’s Known” and “The Word of Your Body.”
Ciurczak and Mamminni also rejuvenate “Totally F-cked” with in-your-face choreography and creatively focus the audience’s attention on the schoolboys and schoolgirls in “Touch Me.”
This production is nearly perfect. The talented orchestra keeps up with song changes and complements the casts’ voices with just enough violin, piano and guitar to keep the focus on the lyrics during large group numbers.  Most importantly, the cast possesses the vibrant energy needed for such a swift-moving show. Spring Awakening at USC proves to be a prime example of independent theater at its finest.
Though all seven shows are at capacity, a waitlist will be posted outside of the Massman Theatre and rush seats will be available.
Congrats to my dear summer roommates, Michelle and Manuel!
I watched the birth of this independent film group and wish I was in LA to have seen the production!
bisous!

Relay for Life exemplifies alcohol-free fundraising. 
In response to the article “Charity events can raise more funds without alcohol” on Jan. 24, there are a number of charity events and organizations on campus that are alcohol-free.
One of these is Relay for Life, which raises money for the American Cancer Society. Every year, more than 800 students, faculty, alumni and community members go to Cromwell Field for 24 hours to raise money for cancer research. This event raises more than $100,000 for the American Cancer Society. Colleges Against Cancer, the planning committee for this event, strives to find entertainers, speakers and activities to make this event enjoyable as well as meaningful.
Articles that ignore our event and the others like ours are both discourteous to us as well as the student body. Alcohol is not necessary for students to be passionate or to donate time and money to causes. Though many organizations do throw parties, parties are hardly organizations’ only efforts at activism. This newspaper should award more respect to the wide variety of philanthropy on campus.
The 2012 USC Relay for Life is March 31 to April 1. Visit relayforlife.org/uscca for more information.

“We Are Considerate” campaign falls on deaf ears.
I have been — like so many other professors and students walking to classes or meetings on campus — nearly knocked to the ground by students on bikes or skateboards.  The “campaign” to promote courtesy has had zero effect on these human missiles, who aim straight for anyone in their way.
Is it going to take serious bodily harm to someone to finally end this reign of terror by rude, selfish and reckless members of the “Trojan Family”?
Not long ago, I was walking my small dog near Taper Hall, favoring my right foot after a botched surgery. I stopped to fix my dog’s leash. A young man on a skateboard behind me came close to colliding with me. He swerved around me, made rude comments and zipped off on his skateboard. I shouted after him that he was supposed to “be aware, be courteous.”  He shouted back, “I’m an associate dean, I can do whatever I want.”
It isn’t just this rogue would-be administrator. It’s absolute anarchy out there. Why do we all have to be put at risk because of this extraordinary sense of entitlement?
Carol Muske-Dukes
Professor of English
Honestly, from a Professor of English I’d expect much better. You of all people ought to know the power of words. When you start throwing literary bombs like “human missiles” and “absolute anarchy” don’t you understand that you’re part of the problem. Your sense of entitlement is equally unreasonable as the skateboarder’s hubris when he nearly hit you.
To say that bikers “aim straight for anyone in their way” just absolutely demolishes any shred of credibility you might have had. Bikes and pedestrians share the road, and frequently without issue. The problem comes when people aren’t attentive, bikers and pedestrians included. If you walked into someone while texting on your phone or fumbling in your bag, would you blame that person? When a pedestrian is nearly hit by a bicyclist because the pedestrian is wandering across the street without taking proper stock of their surroundings, it’s not the bicyclist’s fault.
The same goes for bikers and boarders. Do you see what your ineptitude has created? DON’T ride your bike with a coffee in one hand, a poster in the other, and your phone held up to your ear by your tilted head. And please be aware that we need to SHARE the road. If the small number of bicyclists who drive unsafely do not shape up, the vast majority of us who ride cautiously will suffer. Don’t you see? Its people like this English professor who appeal to HYPERBOLE to gain influence…and THEY ARE GAINING INFLUENCE. The new bike study at USC is a front to make it seem like the inevitable bike ban was carefully planned and logically implemented. Stay vigilant and ride safe so that crazies don’t have any more excuses to write letters like this!

I have always been intrigued by the lack of etiquette that people have when it comes to elevators. Sure, it’s nice to hold the door for someone or press the floor button for others, but there comes a time when snap decisions have to be made in exigent circumstances.
I made the decision to hold the elevator for a girl who seemed to be in a rush. I pushed the twelfth-floor button as she squeezed inside. She nodded, turned and pushed the second-floor button. I looked at her in utter confusion. She wasn’t handicapped or carrying anything heavy besides a California Pizza Kitchen box, yet she decided to take the elevator when the stairs were a mere 10 feet away. I brushed it off, giving her the benefit of the doubt.
Cooper Haskell | Daily Trojan
The elevator stopped and opened to the second floor. She stuck her head out and looked down the hall. She said something like, “I think this is my floor. Can you hold the door while I run out and check?” Without giving me a chance to answer she took off down the hall. She never returned.
Placing people in awkward situations is insidious and unnecessary. Uniformity, coherence and common sense are key.
The distance for holding an elevator door for others is haunted by a penumbra. There is no perfect distance. Nevertheless, a quick decision must be made. If no perceivable effort to reach the elevator is made on their part, letting the door close is permissible. No harm, no foul. If they have to raise their voice to get your attention, they could easily reroute their energy to walking up some stairs.
Waiting for the elevator with others can quickly snowball into misunderstandings. Once, while waiting, the person next to me pressed the button to call the elevator. Not a moment later, I pressed the button again — a re-call.
My mistake most likely came off one of two ways: Either I believed he was not adequately equipped to call the elevator or I partook in the cultural misconception that pushing the button twice makes the elevator speed up.
Once you enter the elevator, the following dreaded question rears its ugly head: “What floor?” That decision really depends on the comfort levels of the individuals involved; it is completely subjective.
If you happen to occupy the space around the buttons in a crowded elevator, you have tacitly agreed to take on the responsibility of asking, “What floor, everyone?” But, for instance, in a non-crowded ride, if someone enters while listening to music, don’t ask — just give him or her space. Eye contact is not necessary. It is up to him or her to press the button.
No one should have to go through the humiliation of pantomiming a conversation for something that is so easily resolved.
The overcrowded elevator is the definitive peevish situation I strive to avoid. Nothing is more pernicious than being trapped and pressed up against a stranger for the interminable duration of a now regretful elevator ride.
Best guess for a comfortable ride: five to seven occupants. The four corners are claimed and empty spots are filled. This arrangement leaves room for elbows, bags and breathing — all the necessities. Should an emergency occur, claustrophobia can potentially be avoided.
In an elevator, everyone is trying to get somewhere. Making that trek slightly more bearable for all is something we can all appreciate.
 
Andrew Gomez is a senior majoring in philosophy politics and law. His column “Bête Noire” runs every other Thursday. 
Ummm yes it’s an article! It is appropriately in the “Bête Noire” column, “Bête Noire” meaning pet peeve, makes sense to you now?
I met my husband in a university elevator when we were grad students, and we’re just about to celebrate our 25th anniversary. Keep an open mind and a positive attitude, for you never know where your ride might lead.
I have to agree with Mark. I make sure I give a very loud look toward the person walking in at the first floor and pressing the second floor button. Thank you to the person who noticed me and said, “I know, I’m lazy…” Uour honesty was appreciated.
The worst thing I experience on a regular basis while traveling from the ground floor to the 4th floor at the Ronald Tutor Campus Center are those who have decided, “I will not use the elegant and grand staircase that flows from the International Plaza to the 2nd floor, but instead, I will further the obesity rate in this great nation and take the elevator.”  REALLY?  I mean, REALLY?
….Is this seriously an article? Come on, DT
The article is dealing with etiquette. Which is one thing that many people seem to be lacking recently around here, 
as you can see from this

and this (the second letter)..

and let us not forget James Franco’s recent documentary.
Yeah, people are aloof nowadays because of our digitized culture. I try the “friendly thing” in all perfunctory social instances. But when people act indifferent, or straight out ignore me, after polite gestures, I used to get upset. I don’t care as much anymore. I’ve grown thick skin and realize that some people’s upbringing formed their callous gestures. Some are afraid that their gestures are awkward and hence their “unrequited responses.”
I take another view re the elevator ride. I feel that our digitized culture has created too much separation between us, so I always engage with everyone in the elevator. At the beginning of the day I ask each person if he or she will have a good day – they think about it and respond. I encourage them to imagine a great day, and suggest that if things aren’t going so well by 3 in the afternoon, they should remember that they have met the elevator cheerleader, and their days will be great again. We always share a smile (even if it’s between my elevator companions, with the subtext of – she’s a looney, isn’t she?) Then I suggest that I’m recruiting, and everyone can be an elevator cheerleader.  We’ve made a human connection, and our time will be all the richer for it.

Adele’s performance hiatus is coming to an end.
The Grammy Foundation officially announced that the singer will perform on the 54th Annual Grammy Awards stage scheduled to air Feb.12.
About five months ago, Adele had surgery on her vocal cords. She was forced to cancel her sold-out U.S. tour in order to have the surgery done.
The end date of her vocal rest was unknown, but after posters for the Grammy Awards had the face of Adele on them, rumors started spreading about her return.
On Jan. 31, Adele said on Twitter, “Ima be, Ima be singing at the Grammys. It’s been so long I started to forget I was a singer! I can’t wait.”
The Grammy Awards can be a really successful night for Adele. Her song “Rolling in the Deep” is nominated for three awards, including Record of the Year, Song of the Year and Best Short Form Music Video.
She is also nominated for Best Pop Solo Performance for “Someone Like You” and Album of the Year and Best Pop Vocal Album for her latest album 21. That is a total of six Grammy nominations.
Other performers for music’s biggest night include Coldplay, Foo Fighters, Bruno Mars, Rihanna, Taylor Swift, Katy Perry, Paul McCartney, Blake Shelton and many more.
The Grammys air Feb. 12 at 8 p.m. on CBS.

Jean Dujardin is a name you should know and start learning how to pronounce now.
The French actor who stars in The Artist could walk away with an Oscar this year.
Jean Dujardin and George Clooney both walked away winners at the Golden Globes several weeks ago for Best Actor, but the general consensus was that George Clooney would continue his winning streak all the way through the biggest awards show, the Oscars.
Those feelings quickly changed on Sunday, however, when Jean Dujardin won the SAG Award for Best Actor over Hollywood’s favorite leading man. The Artist star is charming in the black-and-white silent film that is likely to win Best Picture.
George Clooney, who has already won an Oscar for his performance in Syriana, isn’t out of the running just yet, but if the SAG Awards are any indication, he certainly has competition.
Since 1994, the actor that has won the SAG Award has gone on to win the corresponding Oscar all but four times.
The plot thickens.
I would love to see the Frenchman get over the ridiculously overrated Clooney–I liked him better on the Golden Girls.
