After reviewing the results of last year’s annual library survey, USC Libraries has began the process of completely overhauling its website.
For the past few years, the website has been one of the top five complaints from students. USC Libraries Dean Catherine Quinlan said the website was updated continually since it was last re-designed in 2009.
Quinlan noted that, when the new re-design project is completed, it will be the most significant upgrade to the website in at least five years.
“We realized the technological infrastructure of the website had to be completely re-done,” Quinlan said.

Quinlan said the new website is projected to be up and running by December.
The project aims to enable online users to search all systems and data sources at once, gaining access to all the different sources though a single search engine. However, unlike common Internet search engines, users will gain access to domains that have been reviewed and deemed legitimate by librarians.
“With Google, you don’t really know what you’re getting,” Quinlan said.
Re-designing and updating the website will allow users to have easier access to information  and tools that already exist, according to Quinlan.
“We’ve heard from pretty much everyone that it’s hard to find things and that tools are not visible,” Quinlan said.
These inconsistencies with the fundamental features of the site, particularly with the search engine, stands as a major source of frustration for some users.
“I type in an author or architect and gives like 10 options before the name comes,” said Norma Maldonado, a graduate student pursuing a master’s in architecture. “I think this change will help.”
Not everyone feels a rehaul is necessary, however. Some students said they think the current site is adequate for research.
“I use the website for doing research for my essays,” said Xiaojie Wang, an undecided freshman. “It’s pretty clear and straightforward and I can get what I want.”
Other students had a different spin on the upcoming changes,  saying that no improvements were needed for the site but that increased development and refinement of the site would benefit the student body in the long run.
“I don’t think it’s necessary,” said Allison Begalman, a freshman majoring in screenwriting. “It’s fine right now … [but] I guess if it’s going to help people and be more accessible, then why not?”
Though the website will not necessarily include any brand-new features, university libraries are looking to improve compatibility with cell phones and tablets.  It’s unclear whether the site will simply be optimized for mobile platforms or if new tools, such as a smartphone app, will be considered. Wang, for one, felt such an app would make searching the libraries’ resources much simpler for students on the go.
“I would love to have iPhone apps for USC Library,” Wang said. “I already have one for the Lyon Center, so it will be way more convenient to have mobile apps.”
But looking at the big picture, Hugh McHarg, the associate dean of planning and communication for USC Libraries, said the project is particularly important because the website is the primary way people interact with the library’s collection services.
“Constantly improving [the website] is always important to us and always a priority,” McHarg said. “We want to find a way to bring all [the library’s] resources together so the website is more consistent and accessible.”
Quinlan said the new site should help students to finally be able to access the information with ease.
“I’m most excited to make it easier for students to use the resources that we acquire so thoughtfully for them,” Quinlan said. “It frustrates me that we find all these resources and then people cannot find them.”
The USC Libraries does have both a mobile app and a mobile interface for searching our resources. You can find more information here: http://www.usc.edu/libraries/services/mobile/
-John Jackson, USC Libraries
Just one point of clarification–we’re looking at the entire Web experience for this redesign, including better ways to make research resources accessible through mobile devices.
We do have an iOS app available now, however, as well as a Facebook app. We encourage everyone to learn more about the apps and how to use them here: http://dotsx.usc.edu/newsblog/index.php/main/comments/homer_catalog_now_available_through_usc_libraries_app_for_ios/
Thanks very much.

The Undergraduate Student Government voted Tuesday to pass a resolution representing undergraduate support for the creation of a new Veterans Resource Center on the University Park Campus.
Veterans Association President Joshua Jacobs, Veterans Association Vice President Keith Williams and Veterans Association member Matthew Leiv, all of whom have been working with Commuter Senator Adam Prohoroff on the project since early 2012, drafted the resolution. Though USC already has an office of Transfer and Veteran Student Programs, the resolution encourages a stand-alone focus on assisting vets.
“The idea of the resource center is that when a veteran gets here, whatever is going on with them in their lives — whether it be professionally, personally or academically — gets directed to who exactly to go to, rather than navigating everything else that exists while they’re dealing with a great deal of transition in their lives,” Jacobs said.
Jacobs said the center is a necessity given the difficulty associated with veterans transitioning from life in the service to attending a top university.
“All of these major life changes happen before our first day of school in a few short months,” Jacobs said. “On top of that, we’re competing in one of the most international and highly acclaimed universities in the world. We’re kind of set up to fail.”
There are currently 608 student veterans enrolled in the university using G.I. Bill benefits, 140 of which are undergraduate students and 468 of which are graduate students.
A total of 54 percent of student veterans surveyed have transferred from or previously attended schools that have established Veterans Resource Centers, prompting the university’s Veterans Association to call for the establishment of a center on campus. There are currently Veterans Resource Centers at UCLA, UC Irvine, UC Santa Barbara and a number of other universities.
The School of Occupational Therapy and Occupational Sciences has committed to providing clinics and the School of Social Work will provide interns for the center. Additionally, the Financial Aid Office has looked into providing a financial aid officer for the veterans at the center.
Jacobs said the School of Occupational Science and Occupational Therapy has taken over fundraising for the center, which will go toward funding space and routine functions at the center.
To Jacobs, the resource center is essential to help bridge the diverse backgrounds of veterans with both one another and with the whole student population.
“We’re the most at-risk student population, and we’re also the most diverse student population,” Jacobs said. “Every race, religion, creed, sexuality, gender — everyone is represented in veterans.”
The USG Senate passed the resolution unanimously, showing undivided support for current and future veterans.
“We knew that the veterans on campus were really concerned about the issue of having a Veterans Resource Center where they could find everything in one place,” Prohoroff said. “After meeting with a lot of commuter veterans this past year with this problem, it’s satisfying to see that this portion of the student body being served.”

Rikiesha Pierce, a senior majoring in sociology, stood in front of Tommy Trojan and addressed the crowd assembled in front of her.
“I am not a token. I belong to my community,” she declared. “I will fight for my community with tooth and nail and fists.”
Pierce was among approximately 60 students who gathered for the Black Student Assembly’s March on Trousdale on Tuesday. The organization held the event to highlight student causes and the efforts being made to create change on campus. The March on Trousdale also concluded BSA’s celebrations honoring Black History Month.
The march coincided with the 50th anniversary of the 1963 March on Washington, where Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. gave his “I Have A Dream” speech.
Students marched from the Gavin Herbert Plaza Fountain at approximately 11:15 a.m. and stopped in front of Tommy Trojan. As students marched they chanted, “People united will never be divided” and “United we stand; united we fall.”

Though the BSA hosted the event, many student organizations presented speeches in front of the crowd. Representatives from the Women’s Student Assembly, Latina/o Student Assembly and the Queer and Ally Student Assembly came to show support.
Students held signs representing their different political and civic causes on campus. BSA also encouraged students to attend the event wearing business clothes.
“If you look at pictures from the March on Washington, people came with a mission and dressed like the policymakers in Washington — they were lobbying,” said Lamar Gary, the executive director of BSA. “Today, we also want to be taken seriously, so we’re dressing like the people who make change at the university.”
Many students expressed their discontent at recent changes made by the administration and believed that there were cyclical issues with university policies. The executive director of Program Board, Juan Espinoza, cited the construction of the fences at the entrances of the University Park Campus.
“I don’t want to be known as the generation that closed the institution off to the community and new ideas,” Espinoza said. “These forums of interaction are the ones that build the world we see. We’re in one community. We sit in South Central in one community.”
Some students recognized the significance of the event in relation to Black History Month, but said the beliefs they expressed were significant to the entire student body. Mellissa Linton, the executive director of the Queer and Ally Student Assembly, said that the event represented equality not just for one group, but for everyone.
“None of us will be free until we all are,” Linton said. “We need to stick together. None of us should shut up until we are all free.”
Many marchers said the ideas being voiced in front of Tommy Trojan need to continue to be voiced in order to create long-lasting change.
“When you don’t have your sign and when you’re in a classroom where people don’t have the same belief as you, will your cause continue?” said Princeton Parker, a sophomore majoring in communication.
After individuals spoke, the crowd listened to the full version of King’s famous speech. Pierce was inspired by hearing the unedited version of the speech.
“King’s words definitely ring true,” Pierce said. “It’s like listening to a good sermon again. I was especially impressed that many people listening to the speech were people who were not only black. All types of people were here.”
In fact, Gary said one of the greatest successes of the event was that it attracted people from all cultures.
“I’m pleased people got up there and really represented their causes and didn’t hold anything back,” Gary said. “Usually people feel like they’re preaching to the choir, so this was a forum where people could broadcast to various crowds and spread information about their causes.”
To Espinoza, the march illuminated the purpose of encouraging students to express their beliefs.
“With this public visual, we can have a change,” Espinoza said. “We are showing that each individual has agency. We want all students to realize their incredible self-worth.”
The event concluded with students singing the Negro National Anthem “Lift Every Voice and Sing.”
Gary said he hopes that the ideas expressed and the community built at the march will continue to develop and expand.
“Today, we began the dialogue,” Gary said. “Tomorrow, I want people to take the next steps to create change and educate others on the types of steps we all should be making for our causes.”
hello, previous commenter. i have one question: are you black?
Hi Angie,
Does it matter if I am black, partially black or not at all?
Black people love marches. I think symbolism is good but real action is better. Right here, right now – the most damaging element that is keeping black people down is black people. A father making a baby and then leaving to not raise his own kid is more damaging then any racy, off color joke a comedian can make. However, in our politically correct society – we ignore real problems and focus on symbolic ones. Let’s use some common sense and really try to fix problems – not just burn calories shaking our fist at the MAN. An Asian family – fresh off the boat – raises their kids to respect education and hard work. In one generation those kids go off to Stanford and Caltech and become productive professionals leading fulfilling lives. Juxtapose that with a family addicted to Section 8 housing and food stamps – who can not imagine feeding and sheltering themselves if left to their own devices. Those kids are not taught to respect education and in fact have little respect for much of anything. Those kids make babies at an early age and the cycle continues…Those families get stuck in the ghetto and all the media and politicians want to do is shake their fist at successful people to pay more of their “fair share” so we can get more people addicted to Section 8 housing and food stamps. It would be great if one day BSA showed to courage to speak out on issues that matter and not just dance around symbolic ones.

Spring practice is right around the corner. Matt Barkley, Robert Woods, Khaled Holmes and Nickell Robey are making the rounds at the NFL Combine. This should be a period of positive thoughts and new beginnings for Trojans both past and present.
Too stubborn? · Despite disappointing offensive production in 2012, it appears the USC football team will turn to head coach Lane Kiffin for play-calling duties going into the 2013 regular season. — Kelvin Kuo | Daily Trojan
 
Instead, the focus of USC football continues to be on a recurring topic — the circus that is the coaching staff.
USC head coach Lane Kiffin is still running the show, but that’s about the only thing still the same from last season. Former assistant coach/de facto defensive coordinator Monte Kiffin is with the Dallas Cowboys. Old offensive coordinator Kennedy Polamalu is looking for employment. Linebackers coach Scott Hazelton is out. Secondary coach Marvin Sanders is gone.
The Trojan faithful were anxious for changes to the coaching staff, and they got them — just not in the way many envisioned.
ESPN Pac-12 blogger Ted Miller gave his take on the new coaches earlier this week, pointing out that the replacements have been given ambiguous job titles. New offensive line coach Mike Summers will also serve as running game coordinator — that’s not to be confused with running backs coach Tommie Robinson, who is also passing game coordinator. In Miller’s opinion, “if you have a budding assistant coach who wants to be called something that makes his job definition less accurate … you should not hire him.”
Personally? I couldn’t care less what each coach calls himself. If someone is smart enough to assist in multiple facets of the offense, more power to him. What I do care about is how this new staff is organized from top to bottom. And I especially care about the play-calling responsibilities for this upcoming season.
With all the hoopla at the other coaching positions, Kiffin has given no indication that he plans to give up his play-calling duties. Polamalu never had more than an honorary title, as he mostly just helped oversee the offense and primarily focused on the running backs. That makes it unlikely that new offensive coordinator Clay Helton will take on a different role than his predecessor.
It’s a shame, too: Not because I have the utmost faith in Helton — USC’s old quarterbacks coach — to do anything out of the ordinary, but because the Trojans were stagnant offensively for large portions of last season. They had weapons and those weapons didn’t scare other teams as much as they should.
As Barkley continues to impress during the interview phase of the combine, potential suitors are starting to shift the blame from his disappointing 2012 season to Kiffin and company. Sports Illustrated’s Peter King talked to three scouts about Barkley, one of whom blamed his recent playing woes on “poor coaching.” Pretty easy to see which staff member the scout might be referring to.
It would be unfair to put all of Barkley’s senior struggles on Kiffin, but we’ve reached a point in the football offseason where it’s worth re-examining the changes the team has made. The Trojans were ranked 40th in points per game last season despite entering the year with what was perhaps considered the most talented offense in college football. USC accumulated just 205 yards of total offense in its 21-7 defeat against Georgia Tech in the Sun Bowl. Those sorts of statistics tend to fade away with time, but they shouldn’t.
Kiffin surely made coaching staff changes out of necessity, because he realized the results from last season weren’t acceptable. But, they also feel slightly forced and more symbolic than results-based.
A coach in the hot seat ought to put serious consideration into revoking some of his responsibilities. It’s not an easy thing to do — pride often gets in the way. Still, Kiffin should at least be recruiting the help of other coaches in the play-calling department. From all indications, however, that’s not the case. Instead, USC is playing musical chairs with no winner in sight.

ok scott wolf
Hi—Kiffihn,to me,is STILL the problem!The turning point was against ND when the Trojans were near the endzone and THREE consecutive offensive plays were called with no imagination,no good results!I still believe we had some talent out there and we BLEW it! ND didn’t show any invincibility against Alabama,they were not a Top 10 team in my opinion!Look for Haden to Fire Kiffen before the upcoming season ends! Don (class ’51)
hell
Results would have been improved if Barkley had played against Notre Dame and Ga. Tech with just
his presence running the offense. Wittek not ready to handle the pressure with his lack of experience vs.
the #1 team at that time (a pretender), and the wind conditions in the Sun Bowl. The Polamalu incident
was sad and not in the best  interest of the Trojan family. Clay Helton was the one to be replaced .

Two members of the undefeated USC women’s water polo team   (12-0) received accolades on Tuesday for their recent performances. Freshman driver Anni Espar was named Mountain Pacific Sports Federation player of the week and junior two-meter Hannah Buckling was named MPSF newcomer of the week.
Espar finished with 10 goals in the UCI Invitational over the weekend, including four goals in the tournament championship game against the formerly No. 1 Stanford Cardinal. USC’s 13-10 victory in that match made the Women of Troy the new No. 1 team in the country.
Buckling, meanwhile, added three goals against Stanford, further helping USC’s cause. She scored all three of the goals in a row for the Women of Troy and finished with five for the tournament.
Buckling was eligible for the newcomer award despite being a junior because she transferred from Sydney University in Australia prior to this season. She was named the Australian female junior water polo player of the year in 2012.
Espar also had an impressive resume leading up to her newest award for USC. As a member of Spain’s water polo team in the 2012 Summer Olympic games, she finished as the second-leading scorer overall. Her team ended up winning a silver medal, falling to the United States in the championship by a score of 8-5.
In the UCI Invitational, the USC women’s water polo team defeated Pacific, San Diego State and UCLA before facing off against the Cardinal, where Espar and Buckley both shined in USC’s tournament-sealing win.
USC will next face off against the Cal Golden Bears in Berkeley on March 2 before returning home for a matchup with the Arizona State Sun Devils on March 9.

The Trojans’ momentum is swinging on a pendulum. Five days ago, USC was riding high: The squad had won four straight games, emitting whispers of USC interim head coach Bob Cantu as a dark horse Pac-12 coach of the year candidate and the Trojans (12-15, 7-7 Pac-12) as a late runaway from an NCAA tournament bid.
Second chances · Senior point guard Jio Fontan (above) and the USC men’s basketball team were outscored by 19 points in the first half alone against the Arizona Wildcats in their last meeting on Jan. 26. – Ralf Cheung | Daily Trojan
 
Right now, however, USC is coming off a crushing loss at Cal followed by a 16-point blowout last Sunday to UCLA, who came into the Galen Center and left with the Trojans’ dignity.
There’s a golden opportunity to quickly put USC back on track, though, and it lies with the visiting No. 11 Arizona Wildcats (23-4, 11-4), whom the Trojans are taking on tonight at 6:30 p.m.
USC is out of the race for the regular-season conference title, but every game is important in terms of gaining a higher seed in the Pac-12 tournament.
“These games are like playoff games,” senior forward Aaron Fuller said. “They determine our future, and we can’t let them slip by.”
Wednesday’s game also provides an opportunity to avenge the Trojans’ humiliating 74-50 loss at Tucson in the two teams’ most recent meeting. The final score was not even as close as it seemed, as USC ended the blowout on a 10-0 run to make it a  24 point contest. The Trojans shot just 28 percent in that game, their lowest output all season. This time around, they hope to establish a more up-tempo attack.
“We have to try to get some transition baskets, because if you rely on trying to score in a set defense, (the Wildcats) make it very difficult,” Cantu said.
The Trojan offense hit a wall again during Sunday’s 75-59 loss to UCLA. The Trojans fell behind by double digits early and made just four of their first 17 shots. Combine those misses with an efficient and up-tempo attack from the Bruins, and USC was out of the game in the first 10 minutes.
“Ball movement is the biggest thing,” senior point guard Jio Fontan said. “[It’s] getting players to move instead of ball-watch. We all do too much of that.”
Senior forward Eric Wise leads USC with 11.9 points per game, but has been shooting just 32 percent from the floor in the five games since USC defeated UCLA in Westwood on Jan. 30. His production has stagnated, and Wise looked a little bit shaken up after he missed two free throws that could have cut the deficit to nine points late in the second UCLA game. He’s looking to return to form against Arizona.
“Any time you’re in conference and you play guys multiple times, people have time to adjust to your personnel and the plays you run,” Cantu said. “I think he’s being guarded in different ways, which has made it more difficult for him to get the same looks. I’d like to see him take more shots from the perimeter.”
The last statement makes sense, as the long-distance attack has been USC’s friend during conference play. Sophomore guard Byron Wesley leads the league in 3-point shooting percentage in conference play, while junior shooting guard J.T. Terrell leads the way with 2.5 3-point makes per game. The Trojans as a team are second in the conference in 3-point percentage, shooting 37 percent from long distance.
Also a lowlight of the UCLA game was the performance of Fontan. He finished with six assists, but USC’s senior leader shot just two of 11 from the floor and fouled out with USC down 14 with 1:31 left, the game all but finished.
Turnovers naturally come with being USC’s primary ball handler for 33 minutes a game, but the bigger issue has been Fontan’s shooting woes. He takes more contested looks than anyone else on the team and is shooting a woeful 33.2 percent as a result. But there’s no other viable point guard option on the roster, meaning Fontan will get the nod through thick and thin.
“There’s going to be nights where a player is not making shots, but his leadership and his ability to run the offense is very, very important to the success of the team,” Cantu said.
That success will be measured Wednesday night, as Fontan and his squad receive another opportunity for a season-defining victory.

Anyone here having to get ready for midterms? That time of the spring season is definitely creeping up on us.
This week’s New Noise capitalizes on the calm before the storm, the laid-back tracks of tranquility released last week that can serve as the soothing soundtrack to one more moment of pre-mid-semester stress-outs. Just let Chance the Rapper’s steady beats be your stress ball, Frank Ocean’s stillness be your La-Z-Boy, Astronauts, etc.’s dreamy echoes be your sleeping mask and Rilo Kiley’s soothing sounds be your massage therapist.
It’s time for a cocktail of chill served on the rocks before we all take that fateful dive into March Madness.
Chance the Rapper: “Acid Rain”
Chicago’s Chance the Rapper will be releasing his new album sometime in April. His new song, “Acid Rain,” perfectly showcases his distinct rapping style against a fresh yet retro-tinged beat.
The song is produced by prolific Seattle hip-hop producer Jake One, who’s worked with everyone from Young Buck, Freeway, Royce da 5’9”, Raekwon, Mr. Porter, Slug, De La Soul and the G-Unit crew. The music is reminiscent of an old school Outkast/Q-Tip vibe and Chance’s unique rapping style glazes over the easygoing beat.
Chance’s conversational raps are extremely casual — he sounds as if he’s just talking about the weather and happening to rhyme. Coolly philosophizing about various life topics, Chance refrains from doing any crazy verbal stylings, mostly because he doesn’t need to; “Acid Rain” is a great milieu for a new talent like Chance the Rapper.
In short, the song is flawlessly produced and has the smoothness factor cranked up to 11.
Frank Ocean: “Eyes Like Sky”
One of the great mysteries of the music world that has yet to face to  general consensus whether or not all the hype surrounding Frank Ocean is actually legitimate. The singer-songwriter had been around in the music industry for a few years behind the scenes, working as a ghostwriter for singers such as Brandy, John Legend, Beyoncé and Justin Bieber before he himself became more well-known.
Then, four years after hanging out on the sidelines, Ocean went forward into the spotlight with his first mixtape in 2011, Nostalgia, ULTRA, which blew the minds of many music critics. Since then, Ocean has been on the receiving end of loads of hype and awards and, despite the scrutiny on his personal life, has managed to release music that suggests that he just might be worthy of all the Ocean mania.
“Eyes Like Sky” is a new track from Ocean that apparently didn’t make the cut for his 2012 album, Channel Orange. The song doesn’t rush anything — instead, it sails along a serenely steady beat. Everything from the vocals to the production is kept basic and simple. Ocean earnestly sings thoughtful and provoking lyrics, and the song is another example of his diversity as an artist.
Astronauts, etc.: “Sideswiped”
Astronauts, etc. is the solo project of Berkeley student Anthony Ferraro. Ferraro had intended on a career in piano, but after complications arose because of problems with arthritis, Ferraro decided to work his magic in the world of electronic music.
Last September, Ferraro released an EP entitled Supermodel Pulp, a five-track odyssey into a world of gentle and futuristic tunes, that came released with a sci-fi video for each song, to boot.
“Sideswiped” is Ferraro’s latest track, a flowing, moody and atmospheric song that captures the resonance of the peace of solitude. The wistful melody is mysterious and the echoing background effects add a dreamy feel to the song.
If Bon Iver joined forces with NASA and decided to record an album in space, this is most likely what it would sound like.
Rilo Kiley: “Let Me Back In”
After a six-year hiatus, Rilo Kiley came back this month with a semi-new release, RKives. The album is the first new release from the band since 2007’s Under the Blacklight, but is not technically any new material — like the title suggests, the record is a collection of Rilo Kiley archival rarities, including B-sides, demos and previously unreleased tracks, all spanning the 10-year career of the band.
“Let Me Back In,” is the “new” title of “I Love L.A.,” Rilo Kiley’s drop-dead gorgeous ode to Los Angeles. The song is wonderfully simple, with breezy acoustic guitars serving as the main backdrop to Jenny Lewis’ velvet voice. The song is quintessential California, invoking images of hanging on the beach while watching the Pacific swallow up the sun.
Meanwhile, “Let Me Back In” is a tall glass of Fresh and the perfect song to unwind to. Not to mention it gives us all a friendly reminder about the awesome subtleties that make Los Angeles what it is. Just listen to Jenny say it: “When the palm trees bow their heads / No matter how wrong I’ve been / L.A. you always let me back in.”
Oh, Los Angeles — you’re so good to us.

For K. Ishibashi, known by his pseudonym Kishi Bashi, music and life can be summed up by a single Japanese phrase: “Ichi-go ichi-e.”
Ishibashi believes so strongly in the phrase (which loosely translates to “one time, one meeting”) that he titled his debut solo album 151a, a play on words with the phrase.
“When said aloud in Japanese [151a] sounds like ‘ichi-go ichi-e,’ which means the beauty of a unique performance or meeting between two people in a moment,” Ishibashi said. “It’s a really huge influence [for me].”
Courtesy of Shervin Lainez
Ishibashi will be playing the Troubador on Thursday in support of his debut album, which has been a long time coming. Before going solo, Ishibashi studied and worked as a violinist and toured with artists such as Regina Spektor, Sondre Lerche and Of Montreal. Additionally, he was a founding member of an indie-rock band, Jupiter One.
He cites his experience on tour with these artists and as a member of a band as the impetus for releasing a solo album.
“[Spektor, Lerche and Of Montreal] inspired me to break out on my own because of the freedom they enjoy and the versatility in touring and in the studio,” Ishibashi said.
As for recording on his own instead of remaining a member of his band, he said that he decided it would give him more creative freedom.
“A rock band is great because, you know, you have all these other musicians to feed off of, but sometimes it kind of drags you down too,” Ishibashi said. “If your vision of music is strong enough, why let anyone else compromise it?”
Ishibashi is under no delusions, however, that the success he has found thus far was an individual effort. He is completely honest about the fact that without the influence of the artists he worked with before, or the recognition of respected individuals in the industry, he might not be where he is today.
“I’m really indebted to [NPR’s All Songs Considered] for launching my career,” Ishibashi said. “[NPR] really hyped up my SXSW showcases last year. … That helped start the long ramp up to where I am right now.”
Host and creator of NPR’s All Songs Considered, Bob Boilen, championed Kishi Bashi as an underdog when he found the musician playing unofficial parties during the SXSW music festival in Austin, Texas. From there, Boilen fully supported Ishibashi’s career and named him “Favorite New Artist of 2012.”
It is really no wonder that Boilen awarded him the title, Ishibashi’s musical style is strong, unique and decidedly new. The creative process behind Ishibashi’s distinct sound relies on inspiration from many sources — Japanese culture being just one.
He chuckled when asked if Japanese culture extended from inspiration for his album name to inspiration for his music.
“I would say definitely not — Japanese [culture] is just a part of me. ‘Ichi-go ichi-e’ was actually a huge influence for me because it means, basically, one moment in time is unique so enjoy it, even with its imperfections. That kind of helped me create this album,” Ishibashi said. “So in a creative sense, Japanese culture has definitely influenced me, but musically, I would say I have a pretty broad spectrum of studies I’ve done over the years.”
Tracks such as “I Am the Antichrist to You” and “Chester’s Burst Over the Hamptons,” both songs on 151a, demonstrate the variety that his studies have afforded him in his musical range. Both tracks feature his extensive studies in classical violin, but in different ways. In “I Am the Antichrist to You” the violin creates a sweeping, mournful sound, while in “Chester’s Burst Over the Hamptions” the upbeat, quick pace of the violin evokes a celebratory and triumphant feel. His studies in violin are merely one other aspect of his multi-faceted style; Ishibashi’s album clearly demonstrates the breadth of his musical interests, as well as his creativity and willingness to experiment with the layering of different sounds.
“I pile on a lot of stuff, kind of oversaturate my tracks at first, and then I peel away this and that. I go for over-intensity and then cut back,” Ishibashi said of his method for producing the multilayered, but still effervescent and harmonious, tracks on 151a.
“Bright Whites,” a track from the album, provides a great example of this airy and whimsical layering. The upbeat, cheerful song begins with jovial chanting in Japanese. Guitar, drums, tambourine, clapping, and other electronically manipulated sounds then join the voices. The chanting fades out while the rest of the instrumentation remains and his singing cuts in, swooping in and swirling about, enchanting the listener with his playful words.
This technique is carried over into his concerts, but Ishibashi’s experimentation adapts to the dynamic pressure of a live audience.
“In studio there’s an infinite amount of time to perfect things, [but] in a live performance, it’s more of a human thing,” he said. “It’s like sports, kind of. The goal of sports is really human triumph — to win — so when I perform live I have that mentality, to do the best that I can.”
Though he feels the pressure to please the audience, Ishibashi still stays true to the idea of “ichi-go ichi-e,” reveling in the opportunity to explore different musical perspectives based on the audience before him.
“I feed off of the energy of the crowd. I’ll try things out — if it works, it works. If it doesn’t, sorry, maybe next time,” Ishibashi said.
This attitude of celebrating each moment, imperfections and all, might be just what makes Ishibashi’s album and live performances so refreshing and exwhilarating.
As for Ishibashi’s future, old fans and newcomers alike can be sure to expect plenty more thoughtful moments and performances. After wrapping up his tour this spring, he will begin writing and recording his second album.
“From the summer on, I really get to concentrate on my next album, I’m actually pretty excited about it, I have a lot of new ideas,” Ishibashi said.
Kishi Bashi has had plenty of achievements to celebrate over the past year — but if his here-and-now philosophy is any indication, the future holds plenty of impressive developments in store.

’ SC apparel needs closer look
Dear USC Community,
As faculty on campus, our labor is valued for our expertise in our fields and our teaching.  Many students look up to us, and we help them find the paths they need to pursue professional life-long goals.
But for those interested in making positive change on campus and in the world, students would do best to look to their peers, who are striving to re-think the value of another form of labor that contributes to making USC a great university.
The Student Coalition Against Labor Exploitation, a student labor rights group at USC, has for the last 14 years been raising the issues of where and under what conditions Trojan apparel is manufactured. This issue has been brought to the forefront of our attention by some of the deadliest sweatshop fires in world history that have occurred in recent months.
In September 2012, the Ali Enterprises factory in Pakistan caught fire and 289 people perished. Then, in November, the Tazreen factory in Bangladesh went up in flames and 112 workers lost their lives.
In both cases, follow-up investigations found that the factories were producing for European and American clothing brands. The factories had no fire exits and the doors on the ground floor were locked, preventing workers from escaping the smoke and flames. If basic fire safety standards agreed to by international labor rights organizations had been enforced, the loss of life would have been vastly reduced or prohibited.
Unfortunately, USC has ties to both of these tragedies.  USC approves certain monitoring organizations to go into factories around the world and certify that Trojan apparel is made under safe working conditions.  One of USC’s approved monitors, UL Responsible Sourcing, inspected both the Tazreen and Ali Enterprises factories in the months before they burned down.
Eighty students gathered in late November to mourn and to stand in solidarity with these workers, and over a hundred students heard the testimony of a survivor of the Tazreen factory fire in February.  Our entire campus community dreads the day that a tragedy like this occurs in a factory where USC apparel is produced.
How could UL Responsible Sourcing miss such flagrant violations of fundamental fire safety code?
The monitors that USC relies on are paid for by brands to inspect factories, creating a conflict of interest in which the more factories a monitor certifies, the more business they receive from brands. It is more than plausible that this leads them to be disinclined not to blow the whistle on the companies that pay their salaries. USC’s corporate monitoring system is clearly broken, and the lives of the countless workers whose safety was entrusted to UL Responsible Sourcing have been devastated.
SCALE has proposed a solution. The Worker Rights Consortium is an independently funded factory monitoring organization with a proven record of fixing violations and preventing abuse. One-hundred-eighty-one other universities across the country have worked with the WRC to protect garment workers, including all of the Ivy Leagues, every University of California campus and nearly every Pac-12 school.
Representatives of SCALE are meeting with President C. L. Max Nikias on March 13 to ask that he sign onto the WRC. As faculty, we fully support the efforts of these students and urge USC’s administration to consider its stake in upholding human rights as seriously as it considers the education of its students.
It is disconcerting that USC has not already taken this basic step to uphold workers’ rights in factories where Trojan apparel is produced. USC’s central mission is “the development of human beings and society as a whole through the cultivation and enrichment of the human mind and spirit,” and to fulfill this mission, USC must do its part to ensure the well-being of Trojan family members in factories around the globe.
Fight On for a sweatshop-free university!

It’s a shame that president Nikias founded our Levan Institute for Humanities and Ethics. I was a student worker there and the home page literally says: 
“Helping students acquire values of moral discernment, love of truth and beauty, understanding of self, and respect for and appreciation of others.”
It’s a terrible reputation to have.
Interesting how all the professors who signed on were from the SCA and not Marshall or Viterbi. I think they lack a fundamental understanding of the global economy and the process by which developing nations become developed nations (Korea, Taiwan being superb examples). As we provide manufacturing jobs to countries like China and Vietnam, we help them on their process of development, and begin the process of them developing their middle class. These workers are significantly better off than they would have been otherwise jobless or as an agricultural laborer making significantly less money. Also, you can look at recent child labor and work quality reforms in China as a significant step in their process of development. Ultimately, SCA professors should stick to things like movie reviews, Oscars, etc. instead of trying to insert their opinions on international trade where they have no expertise. I’d be happy to hear the opinions of Marshall undergrad and MBA professors who actually would be qualified to give their two cents on these matters.
Johnny, I don’t think you should need an MBA to talk about ethical issues.  This might be about jobs in developing countries and these jobs may affect the global economy, but that’s not the crux of their opinion here.  Workers rights and economic development are not identical.  So I don’t see it as a problem that SCA and Dornsife professors want to talk about ethical issues concerning other human beings.
I also encourage you to see if you can talk to some people at Marshall and Viterbi and get their take on issues like this.  It doesn’t have to be an agreeing opinion; dialogue is a wonderful thing and it people from those fields have a different view on this, that’s awesome.
Hi Chung, 
Thanks for the feedback. With regards to your comment on needing an MBA; the crux of what I was trying to say is that I feel very uncomfortable having a bunch of professors who spend the vast majority of their time studying film, production, screenwriting, etc. having any influence when it comes to international trade and finance. It would be like having the Oscars heavily influenced by a crew of investment bankers or the Star Wars screenplay written by accountants.  
And I completely agree with you and would certainly like to hear what the Marshall and Viterbi professors have to say, although I think their lack of being a signatory to this Letter speaks for itself.
Actually, Star Wars being written by accountants sounds compelling…

After months of doomsday predictions regarding the imminent enactment of across-the-board spending cuts, the sequester is finally set to go into effect this Friday.
The emergency cuts, which were part of a deal struck between Congress and President Barack Obama in 2011 to extend the United States’ borrowing authority and cut the budget deficit, will automatically trigger $85 billion in cuts set to affect areas of government spending from border patrol to education to defense.
Oddly, what has received much of the attention regarding this issue in the past few days is a warning by Transportation Secretary Ray LaHood about the potential impact of sequestration cuts on air travel, which he said could cause travelers to face longer flight delays and lines at security checkpoints as a result of cuts to the Federal Aviation Administration.
Mollie Berg | Daily Trojan
Tough luck. Such scare tactics should not distract from the necessity of cutting excessive government spending and getting on track toward a sustainable and responsible federal budget. In fact, austerity measures resulting from the sequester might be just what lawmakers need to incentivize fiscal responsibility in the future.
LaHood was only one of many leaders to urge lawmakers to come to an agreement on an emergency plan, proposed by Senate Democrats, to avoid sequestration. The plan would raise taxes on the rich, slash federal agriculture subsidies and reduce defense spending after American troops fully withdraw from Afghanistan.
Senate Republicans, however, are refusing to accept any plan that increases taxes following their January concession to increase tax revenue for top-income brackets — a concession they made as part of a deal to avoid the most negative effects of the fiscal cliff.   Though Democrats have the right idea regarding the cuts, the plan is unacceptable because of the proposition to increase revenue by slapping the rich with even higher taxes. Alleviating the budget crisis by punishing top-income earners for having more wealth is not only patently unfair and counterproductive to economic growth, but also ignores the root cause of the problem: irresponsible, wasteful government spending.
The only answer? Smart spending cuts across the board before we get to the point of automatic trigger cuts. Recognizing superfluous expenditures that are not absolutely vital to the function of government or national security is a good place to start cutting.
In an interview with MSNBC, LaHood denounced the sequester as taking a “meat ax approach” to the fiscal crisis. He used this rhetoric as part of a plug for the Democrats’ proposed plan, stating that it would “[save] the money that needs to be saved.”
Unfortunately, it is no longer about “saving” money. That would imply that the government has money to save. The budget deficit at the end of fiscal year 2012 was a staggering $1.1 trillion, an amount that constitutes over 70 percent of the nation’s gross domestic product. According to the Congressional Budget Office, such a high percentage has not been seen since 1950.
These statistics reflect a dire situation, and, as such, an extreme response might be the best thing for moving toward a lasting solution. The sequester is not a sudden and unexpected political phenomenon. It has been a long time coming and is an unfortunate consequence of lawmakers’ failure to close our obscene federal budget deficit. Continuing to kick the proverbial can down the road is no longer an option, and lawmakers should use this as motivation to work toward a long-term budget solution.
It is easy for people to forget the need to fix the fiscal crisis if the government continues to enact 11th-hour budget deals, but the cuts that will come with sequestration will bring the urgency of the situation to the forefront of national discourse. Hopefully, this discourse will prompt the decisive action on this issue that has been so conspicuously absent in Washington during the past couple of years.

Every dollar that the federal government spends comes from us – one way or another. The more the government spends, the more it MUST take from others. 
Nearly every function that the government does now was done by non-government entities or not deemed necessary years ago. For over 100 the USA managed without income taxes, medicare, social security, a large military, EPA, IRS, FBI, Dept of Education, Dept of Energy, NASA, TSA…
In reality, all the functions of government are done by real people since the government is composed of people. Hmmm, should we allow other groups to compete for the government’s functions? Are the government functions so necessary that we need to grant monopolies and force people to use the services? Is the government doing such a great job that we should give it a RAISE? Are the current regulators falling down on the job? Should we FIRE the government?
If government does less, spends less, the rest of us will have more…
We’re all doomed!
“The budget deficit at the end of fiscal year 2012 was a staggering $1.1 trillion, an amount that constitutes over 70 percent of the nation’s gross domestic product. ”
USA GDP 2012 = $15.7 trillion
Deficit = $1.1 trillion 
1.1/15.7 = 7 percent, Not 70
“…superfluous expenditures that are not absolutely vital to the function of government or national security”
I find it hard to see how NIH and NSF aren’t vital functions of government. They account for the vast majority of basic research funding in most fields, particularly medical research. As far as national security, I’m glad you brought that up because the civilian side of the DOD, which IS VITAL to the combat preparedness of our nation, will be devastated by these cuts. 
It’s amusing that you’re still firmly in the austerity school of thought, when it has become patently clear how those policies have turned out in Europe. They’re sliding back into recession and worsening their own problems. Yet you advocate making the same destructive mistake.
I think it being that we spend more than (I forget how many) x countries combined on national security, we can afford some cuts. I’d rather take a mild dosage of pain/austerity now than end up at rock bottom like Greece, with interest rates on national debt about 16% and crawling on hands and knees to the IMF for a loan to stay solvent. Yeah, austerity is tough but you know what, we can’t afford to keep spending the way we are anymore. Suck it up
