Dr. Carolyn C. Meltzer will serve as the dean of the Keck School of Medicine of USC starting March 1, Provost Charles Zukoski announced Tuesday in a communitywide email. 
The Dean Search Advisory Committee, established in June and made up of 16 faculty, staff and students, reviewed more than 130 candidates for the position. The previous dean, Dr. Laura Mosqueda, resigned in August 2020 to advance USC’s geriatric efforts. Steve Shapiro served as interim dean since July 1, replacing interim Dean Narsing Rao.
In an interview with the Daily Trojan, Meltzer said “authentic” and “trauma-informed” leadership is an important step in moving past previous Keck scandals. 
In 2017, USC terminated former Keck Dean Carmen Puliafito following drug use, on-campus partying and keeping company with criminals. A later report found that USC paid Puliafito $1.8 million after his termination. Dr. Rohit Varma, Puliafito’s successor, resigned after less than a year in the position following a report that he sexually harassed a researcher when he worked as a junior professor. 
“I’m committed to supporting all our people and trying to prevent future issues,” Meltzer said. “I don’t tolerate this behavior very well, especially when something impacts another colleague.”
Meltzer currently works at Emory University School of Medicine, where she has served as chair of the Department of Radiology and Imaging Sciences for nearly 16 years. Meltzer said her position at Keck is an opportunity to apply her skillset from previous roles. 
“The strengths of the institution just seemed right in my wheelhouse,” she said. “I also was very drawn to new leadership that is committed to values-based decision making, and that’s critical for me.”
Meltzer also serves as chief diversity and inclusion officer and executive associate dean of faculty academic advancement, leadership, and inclusion at Emory. In her upcoming dean role, she hopes to also bring her ideas about diversity, equity and inclusion.
“In a world in which we don’t consider health equity, part of the quality outcomes of healthcare isn’t fully informed, so I hope to bring that lens,” Meltzer said. 
Upon assuming the position, Meltzer intends to develop a plan that includes investing in translational research to improve human health and working with educators.
“I’m going to spend the beginning listening a lot and learning what’s important to folks,” she said. “I will not approach a strategic plan without having it be broadly informed.”

Ben Rhodes, former speechwriter and deputy national security advisor for former President Barack Obama, spoke Tuesday about threats to democracy around the world, the rise of authoritarianism in the United States and his new book “After the Fall: Being American in the World We’ve Made” in a Zoom event hosted by the Dornsife Center for the Political Future.
The talk, moderated by CPF co-directors Bob Shrum and Mike Murphy, was part of the Center’s “Bully Pulpit” podcast, which invites experts across the political spectrum and aims to embody CPF’s central mission to “respect each other and respect the truth.” 
Following a discussion about politics in the U.S. today, Rhodes began the conversation by discussing the shift toward nationalist authoritarianism, a change represented during former President Donald Trump’s presidency. During that presidency, Rhodes said he personally felt threatened because of his political association with Democrats, having worked under Obama. He cited events such as Trump’s team sending private spies to look into Rhodes’s past and running online misinformation campaigns against him.
“We are drifting in a direction where being in the political opposition of, in particular the kind of Trumpian brand of Republican, is increasingly, not yet dangerous, but it is an early stage characteristic of what happens to people in semi-autocracies,” Rhodes said. 
According to Rhodes, a central idea in his book is to understand the political climate in the U.S. by taking an outsider’s perspective. Rhodes said he believes the U.S. shifted from an example of democracy around the world to a force that discredits it, and autocratic countries such as Russia are able to take advantage of that. Rhodes said he feels the main reason Russian President Vladimir Putin wanted Trump to win the presidency is because it would lower the American democracy’s reputation around the globe.
“[Trump] is so obviously corrupt that any Russian cab driver on the street can look at that and think ‘Well if that guy gets to the top of American democracy, then why is democracy any better than what we have here,’” he said. “[Putin] wanted to show that democracy was hopelessly corrupt.”
Shifting his focus to Japan, Rhodes recalled a meeting he had with some Japanese business leaders in August 2017, around the time of the Unite The Right rally in Charlottesville, Va. Rhodes realized in that meeting that the impact of the U.S.’s democracy directly concerned Japanese business leaders more than the American economy.
“Almost every one of them asked me about Charlottesville, Trump and white supremacy,” Rhodes said. “I realized that, in a way, to them, the United States coming into [semi-autocracy] was far more dangerous, and mostly because [it hurt] every assumption that they made about how the world operated … We lost credibility and that hurt people who draw on our example.”
Regarding social media and authoritarianism, Rhodes mentioned China’s surveillance state, where all Chinese citizens are always monitored and need to be cautious when critical of the government or when following cultural norms.
“They’re deploying a massive artificial intelligence capacity to pick up on who’s trustworthy and who’s potentially untrustworthy. And if you say the wrong thing, or if you’re just insufficiently patriotic in your digital footprint, which is very vast today, maybe your kid won’t get into a good school, or maybe you won’t get a job,” Rhodes said. “So there’s this effort to deploy technology kind of holistically across the whole society to shape individual choices.”
Rhodes stressed the importance of governmental regulation on solving the issue of big data in America, and said that a key difference was that America’s data problems stem from corporations while China’s issues stem from their government having too much control over data. 
“As a minimum, seeking to regulate social media and the development of new data mining technologies in ways that safeguard privacy that diminish conspiracy theory and the spread of hate speech,” Rhodes said. “that requires not the confrontation with the Chinese model but the fortification and strengthening of the Democratic alternative.”
Compared to the ideological struggle between communism versus capitalism in the 20th century, Rhodes said he believes there has been a shift from global ideological battles to individual countries focusing on nationalism.
“We’re back in the world of nationalist powers competing … and the immigration issue has been the most potent issue in motivating the nationalist fervor,” Rhodes said. “In Europe the [issue] is immigrant populations are changing the ethnically homogeneous feel of our nation states.”
Shrum said that Rhodes presented powerful descriptions of troubles going on around the world, such as in Hungary and Russia, and stressed the need for USC students to become politically involved.
“I thought the way [Rhodes] formulated Barack Obama[‘s] critique of America as a work in progress, with moments in our past you could be proud of but also moments in our past that you have to be honest about,” Shrum said. “You really have to care about democracy here and abroad, and you have to be active, you have to be involved, or you risk losing it.”
Shrum discussed how Rhodes explained in his book that his experiences investigating America’s mistakes only made him love the ideal of America even more, and he believes that increasing political involvement is one of the main ways to keep America’s founding promises and ideals.
“At the end of the day, I believe there are far more people that believe in the better story of an America that privileges equality than [don’t], but we all have to show up on the field,” Rhodes said.
Kambiz Akhavan, an executive director at CPF said Rhodes was a great choice for the talk because of his real world political experience.
“We wanted to create a bully pulpit for issues and for speakers who could model civil discourse and show that our differences are a source of strength,” Akhavan said. “It’s OK to disagree as long as we can be civil and work together towards common solutions.”

Walking into senior Trevor Trout’s apartment, it’s clear he has an affinity for sports. Jerseys and flags drape the walls, and a large TV sits across from a couch. This is where Trout goes to work, tweeting about sports to over 11,000 followers on his Twitter @totaltroutmove.
Trout is an intern at Fox Sports and works for Wave.tv in Santa Monica. However, he was once a part of the genus he now covers. He originally came to USC as a defensive lineman on the football team but retired in 2020 due to injuries. 
“I kept feeling this chip in my back,” Trout said. “It started getting inflamed. I would just be hobbling after workouts and whatnot. They used to ask me, ‘Trevor are you fine?’ … One day I was just like, ‘No, this is really bad. I can’t keep doing this.’” 
When the pandemic came around, it gave Trout a lot of time to think about his future in football and develop his skills in the media. 
“The pandemic gave me a lot of time to sit in the house and lock in on some other stuff,” Trout said. “I was building my other stuff outside of the game, so it made it an easier transitionwhen I retired.” 
Although they miss having him on the team, Trout’s former teammates have given him their full support. They saw the pain that playing football gave him every day and believe that he made the right choice, even if it is hard for them to say goodbye to a teammate. 
“It’s tough just because you don’t want to see any of your friends or really anyone in as much pain as he was,” former teammate and friend Liam Douglass said. “But he’s a strong guy. I’m happy that he is now a lot happier because he’s not dealing with a lot of the pain … that he was feeling. As a friend, it was tough to see him battle through that everyday.” 
After retiring from football, Trout threw himself into the role of being a “person in the media,” as he calls it. 
“I’m not a media person, I’m a person in the media,” Trout said. “I’ll always look at it that way because the thing is I never imagined doing this … I’m not that far removed yet … Clearly the way I look at things in terms of media and sports they must be pretty solid considering that they’ve worked.” 
Trout has made it far in his media career in a short amount of time. His former professor Alan Abrahamson believes this is because of the work ethic he developed from playing football. 
“What you’re looking for in sophomore journalism students is a ‘want-to,’” Abrahamson said. “Because Trevor had a football background, there was never any question of his discipline and his ‘want-to’ … These are all things that … go a long way, not just in determining success in football, but in journalism and pretty much all areas of grown up life.” 
Although Trout has used the skills that he learned from football well, Douglass believes that he would’ve made it this far without the sport.
“Trevor was going to be successful with or without football,” Douglass said. “He’s very smart, he’s very personable, he’s very passionate about what he loves. Whether or not this affects how successful he’ll be in the future, I think it had no bearing on that.” 
Trout not only displays a strong work ethic on the field, but he also exhibits the integrity to call out his peers when he feels as though they are operating incorrectly in the newsroom. 
“We had a football player and he got in a little [fight] at a frat party,” Trout said. “It really wasn’t that big of a deal because no one got arrested. I was in Annenberg at the time … I checked Slack one day, and someone felt it was a story worth reporting. So I remember I went to the Slack and typed in, ‘So we’re not better than this?’” 
Although Trout still has the stature of a football player, which may be intimidating to some, he has a soft inner shell once people get to know him. 
“[Trout] will do anything for the people he considers his friends and family, but because of the way he looks there’s a natural tendency for people to be intimidated by him when he enters a room,” Abrahamson said. “He and I have both remarked many times about how funny that is. In fact, he is one of the world’s greatest, kindest, most generous people … Once Trevor opens up to you and trusts you it’s alifetime trust.”
When Trout first transitioned from football to primarily focusing on media, he wasn’t sure if he fit in. However, after dedicating so much work to his media dream, Trevor eventually developed confidence in his ability. 
“I met a lot of really smart kids here,” Trout said. “At first I was like, ‘Do I belong?’ and then it went from ‘Do I belong?’ very quickly to ‘I’m the guy here’ … I’ll be honest with you, I used to get up at 6 o’clock every morning … This is the easiest life has been for me, probably since I was 14 years old.” 
Trout’s “no excuses” attitude has opened a lot of doors for him in his media career. It is also part of the reason he gained Abrahamson’s respect.
“He asks me for advice about stuff, and, to be honest, I ask him for advice about things I don’t know about,” Abrahamson said. “He’s a remarkable resource for a lot of things. He understands things about Twitter, things about social media … He is really, really knowledgeable about that space. He is, and I say this without hyperbole, one of the nation’s foremost experts on high school basketball recruiting. He really knows his stuff.” 
Even though Trout has been successful in his time without football, the game still calls him. When he’s watching college football games on Saturdays, he feels as though he can suit back up.
“Sometimes I feel like I can still play,” Trout said. “Even though I can’t. It’s one of the things that comes off watching the games all weekend. I’ll see a 18 or 19 year old kid, and he’s running a gap move, and I’m just like he can’t do that … That’s what happens when you get done, either feeling like you left a lot down there or feeling like you were better than you were.”
It is clear that Trout misses football, but those close to him have noticed a brightening of his mood ever since he left it in his past. 
“When he was battling through some stuff, he was more quiet, he wasn’t as outgoing or friendly,” Douglass said. “Compared to now — he’s more outgoing, he’s got a smile on his face all the time … Mentally it’s tough when you have an injury like that that you’re trying to play through. It definitely  takes a toll.” 
Trout’s kind attitude mixed with his tenacious work ethic makes for a strong combination. It is because of these two traits that Abrahamson believes that he will go far.
“Trevor Trout is a really special human being,” Abrahamson said. “He came to USC in most people’s minds as ‘the football player,’ he is so much more than ‘the football player.’ Trevor Trout in one, two, five, 10, 20 years is going to be … one of the leaders of the United States of America, mark my words. He’s thatspecial.”

87 students tested positive for coronavirus this week, Chief Health Officer Dr. Sarah Van Orman confirmed in a student media briefing Tuesday afternoon. These numbers come with growing concern as the University sees increasing levels of positive cases each week, likely suggesting a need for booster shots to continue preventing breakthrough infections.
In the week of Nov. 8, there was a total of 88 positive tests, giving a test positivity rate of 0.3%, a “significant increase” from the positivity rate of 0.23% the previous week, Van Orman said. In October, weekly case numbers remained in the low 20s with a rate of about 0.1% test positivity. 
A rise in coronavirus cases among students and employees mirrors a rise in cases across Los Angeles County, which reported nearly 900 new cases Tuesday. The uptick may reflect decreasing success of the vaccine’s ability to protect from breakthrough infections with increased time since their original vaccination date, Van Orman said.
L.A. County and USC are currently pushing booster shots for all who are eligible in order to prevent an increasing amount of coronavirus cases.
“Over the next few weeks, we’re really encouraging people who have more than six months with Moderna or Pfizer to actually get a booster,” Van Orman said. 
Individuals receiving their booster vaccine are allowed to “mix and match” their vaccines, which may give them a better immune response, Van Orman said. 
Although the vaccine continues to protect against the coronavirus’ worst symptoms, breakthrough infections remain a growing possibility. 
“The vaccines continue to protect against severe hospitalization and death. But we do believe that over time, [the vaccines’] ability to protect us against breakthrough cases is really waning, especially at that six month mark,” Van Orman said.
According to Van Orman, since 95% of students are vaccinated at this point of the semester, most cases at the University are considered breakthrough cases.
Van Orman expects the current level of cases to remain the same for the upcoming week. As students make holiday travel plans, Van Orman encourages students to test before and after returning to campus and to make sure that they are not sick when they return home. 
“Make sure that you don’t travel if you’re experiencing any symptoms at all, and then just be cautious with your social activities, especially over that Thanksgiving weekend,” Van Orman said.
Earlier this month, USC Student Health notified USC students, staff and faculty who have received either the Moderna or Pfizer vaccines more than six months ago or the Johnson & Johnson vaccine two or more months ago of their eligibility for the booster shot.
The University plans to send further recommendations to the student body about boosters, flu shots and coronavirus testing before Thanksgiving break. 
Since the beginning of this flu season, USC has only had “sporadic” cases of influenza. 
Other universities have had influenza outbreaks that pose serious threats to their communities. The University of Michigan is currently under investigation by the CDC after over 500 confirmed cases of influenza have ripped across the campus since October. In the week of Nov. 8, 37% of their student flu tests were positive. This outbreak has caused concern for Van Orman and Student Health about effects of the flu at USC. 
“The University of Michigan right now is having this very large influenza outbreak, so we are concerned about influenza,” Van Orman said. “We’re not seeing significant numbers of cases right now, but we are very concerned about it.”
Eighty-three percent of staff, 75% of faculty and about 75% of students are currently vaccinated against the flu. Despite the Nov. 1 flu vaccine deadline mandated by the University, students are still encouraged to schedule their influenza vaccinations. 
Student Health looks to continue pushing information about the importance of flu vaccination for an assortment of reasons, Van Orman said, including a large concern over the illness’s severity that may result if someone is infected with the coronavirus and the flu simultaneously. In addition, flu outbreaks may have adverse effects on students’ ability to attend classes which has been proven to have a negative effect on grades and the ability to take finals that fall during flu season. 
Flu and booster shot appointments are available at the Lyon Center. Although a shortage in appointments appeared last week because of limited supplies, the University has since restocked and made more appointments available on the mySHR portal. 
For Spring 2022, Student Health looks to ensure incoming students are fully vaccinated. USC is also looking to alter mask and testing policies, but all changes depend on county policies and coronavirus case levels at the time, Van Orman said.
“If our cases stay low moving into spring, we, of course, want to be able to drop [coronavirus-related regulations]. Indoor masking is more driven by [L.A.] County … and they’re going to pin that to what we’re seeing in terms of cases in the county,” Van Orman said.

Although March is a few months away, the tip-off of the college basketball season has me excited again for one of the greatest postseason tournaments in sports. 
Unlike its restrictive football counterpart, March Madness includes a wide array of teams in each conference. Nowhere else would I get to see teams like Oral Roberts and UMBC from relatively unknown conferences knock off powerhouse programs like Ohio State. 
With USC getting into the AP Poll this week, ranked at No. 25, I got extra motivated to look into the future. Even though the Trojans lost Evan Mobley, who is currently dominating in the NBA for the Cleveland Cavaliers, this USC team looks poised to make another tournament run.
All of this hype got me interested in the money that schools receive for getting into March Madness. For traditional powerhouse conferences like the Pac 12, Big 12, ACC and Big 10, the money they get from the tournament is nothing new. 
But for the smaller conferences and programs that qualify, this money can be particularly important for their future. 
It’s important to understand that the schools themselves don’t get the money, but rather their respective conferences decide, and then the conferences give it out to their member schools. 
Moreover, the way that the money gets distributed isn’t simply by increasing the value as teams get further along in the tournament. 
Rather, the NCAA has its own unique system where they payout from a basketball fund. What does this fund compose of, you may ask? Well, it consists of many revenue sources that you would traditionally think of such as television, marketing, general sales and more. Additionally, the NCAA gives funds to conferences based on units instead of giving a dollar value up front. 
The amount for a unit changes every year, but has consistently increased over time (around by 3% per year). For example, a unit was worth $264,859 in the 2017 edition of the tournament. 
Now, the distributed units are not based on the conference’s performance of that payout year. Instead, the NCAA provides these units based on the conference’s performance in March Madness over a previous six-year rolling period. 
I know this sounds kind of confusing, so let me explain with an example. 
Let’s take this upcoming 2022 tournament, for instance. In this case, the NCAA will actually base how many units it provides to the conferences based on their performance from the 2016 tournament to the 2021 tournament. Rather than awarding money due to a single tournament performance, the NCAA awards it for long-term consistency among conferences. 
Conferences have been able to rack up large sums through this unit system. 
For example, the ACC made around $33 million in 2015 through its 21 units. Therefore, expect the Pac-12 to be earning some large amounts after last year’s tournament sending four teams (USC, UCLA, Oregon State, Oregon) to the Sweet 16 and three of them to the Elite 8. 
On another note, once these conferences receive their money, they are highly encouraged to distribute it equally among their member schools. Although some critics will say some schools who don’t really contribute to the conference’s athletics success are still reaping the benefits, it is a good way to keep unity among the member programs. 
Conferences such as the Colonial Athletic Association, which includes schools like William & Mary, Drexel and Hofstra, split half of the money equally and then give the remaining half based on merit through its “Excellence Fund.” 
Therefore, there are potential strategies to give funds out in a more competitive manner rather than awarding everyone equally, but I don’t know how much the big-name conferences will actually implement such a methodology.
USC and the Pac-12 can hopefully make another run in the tournament to get more units for the conference in the future.

Venus and Serena Williams are two of the most accomplished and captivating athletes the world has ever seen. Both sisters are former world No. 1 tennis players, with 30 combined grand slam singles titles, 18 grand slam doubles titles, 122 WTA titles, eight Olympic gold medals and more than $136 million in prize money under their belts. 
As Black women in a predominantly white sport, Venus and Serena faced an unusual set of roadblocks, starting with their earliest days practicing on the run-down public tennis courts of Compton, Calif. Guiding them past these obstacles and nurturing them toward success, by way of a bold, brazen and optimistic 78-page career plan, was Richard Williams: their father, coach and cheerleader. 
After hearing about the lofty paychecks top tennis players receive, Richard crafted his lengthy manifesto mapping out an exact career path for his daughters, a document written before they were even born. Never having played the sport competitively himself, Richard relied on guile and a dogged persistence to push his daughters to the top.
With “King Richard,” director Reinaldo Marcus Green attempts to contextualize the Williams sisters’ extraordinary, unconventional rise in tennis by targeting the early stages of their junior careers. As young girls, Venus and Serena were most influenced by their imposing, larger-than-life father-coach.
In a virtual roundtable attended by the Daily Trojan, Will Smith, who plays the titular “King Richard,” shared his passion for portraying Richard and how an interview featuring Richard and Venus influenced his own parenting. 
“I fell in love with Richard Williams. That was 20 something years ago. And when the opportunity to be a part of this came up, that was the first thing that I remembered,” Smith said. “I knew I wanted to show a father protecting a daughter like that, to the world.”
Tennis fans may enjoy some of the technical talk about strokes and footwork and stances, and there is much to enjoy in the quippy script loaded with witty one-liners and stirring advice. Smith, and Aunjanue Ellis, as Venus and Serena’s mother and matriarch Oracene, or “Brandy,” are standouts rightfully gaining Oscars buzz for their performances. 
But in the 144-minute film, every narrative and directorial choice rules out another direction that could have taken place. Ultimately, the focus on this brief time period limits the film’s depth, offering Richard as a dominating father without a dynamic force to play against. 
It’s as if the filmmakers decided to give us the young, supposedly unformed Williams sisters to avoid the hard work of giving each of them a distinct personality. The girls are portrayed as blank slates, an ironic choice given the vivid and powerful people Venus and Serena each turned out to be.
This desire to shine a light on Richard’s unorthodox leadership methods is understandable, but the movie falls short here, too. The story is about Richard, but the script cannot paint a full picture of his complicated persona while only examining these four years in the middle of his life. Brief mentions of Richard’s upbringing in Jim Crow-era Louisiana are scattered throughout the film, but we don’t get a full sense of what made him the man he became.
Many Black men in the 1950s South in the 1950s faced horrifying racism, but only he raised two world champions who changed the way professional tennis is played. 
For a movie called “King Richard,” many questions about Richard go unanswered. Where did his ambition come from? Who had the biggest impact on his life? Who shaped his perspective? How did he foster the belief that he could coach his two unborn daughters into becoming all-time greats without extensive tennis experience?
The film glosses over a wide-ranging buffet of worthy topics — from racism to gang violence to classism to sexism to police brutality — but never commits to their complexity. At one point, a short news clip depicts the murder of a Black man by the Los Angeles Police Department playing on the Williams’ living room TV. The family watches on for a couple of seconds … and that’s it. Not only did this scene not directly relate to the central plotline, the film failed to mention police brutality at any other point during the film. This scene read as a tangential, lazy attempt to address a hot-topic issue.
Venus and Serena’s tennis careers span nearly three decades during which they experienced cruel, heinous, blatant racism and sexism — not the kind playing on a background TV, but personal and in their faces. Because of the filmmakers choice to focus on Richard and not on Venus and Serena, they missed the opportunity to create a much grittier and emotion-packed drama that could have linked Richard’s experiences with his daughters’ own battles, making the point that racism and sexism are not experiences of a past generation; both issues are alive and well in sport and in the world we send children into every day. 
Instead, only Richard’s experiences in this restrictive four-year time frame were touched on and specific instances of these issues in the sisters’ lives were glossed over or omitted entirely.
The story lacks sufficient tension, partly because we all know how Venus and Serena’s careers turned out. This problem is overcome to some degree in the film’s second half when the focus turns briefly to the all-important relationship between Richard and his wife Oracene.
When the couple’s conversations take center stage, Richard’s character flaws are exposed, offering a different look into the Williams’ home life. The valuable switch from Richard’s to Oracene’s perspective finally makes this feel like more than just a recitation of someone’s cleaned-up bio. 
On the other hand, a flash-forward to 2001 when Venus withdrew before her scheduled semifinal match against Serena could have set up some real drama and brought racism to the fore. Richard and the sisters were accused of match fixing. A nearly all-white crowd booed and hurled racial slurs at Serena during her final while Venus and Richard, sitting in the stands watching, were harassed and verbally attacked. 
The sisters boycotted the tournament for 14 years, underscoring how even respected champions were not safe from prejudice and cruelty. Viewers will also not know from this film that gang violence killed Yetunde, the girls’ eldest sister, nor that Venus was docked points in  the 1999 Australian Open when her beaded hair was declared a “disturbance.” They wouldn’t know about the vile body-shaming Serena faced throughout her career or the head of the Russian Tennis Federation referring to Serena and Venus as “brothers” and saying “it’s scary when you really look at them.”
With all of its merits, the movie leaves an audience longing for the far more poignant stories that could have been told about these extraordinary lives.

Students excitedly murmured in the crowd Monday night at the Ray Stark Family Theater for a Vision and Voices event.
The event featured “Midnight Traveler” (2019) and filmmakers Hassan Fazili and Fatima Hussaini, a couple who documented their migrant journey from Afghanistan to various Middle Eastern and European destinations with their two young daughters, Nargis and Zahra. 
Other moderators and panelists included historian Marjan Wardaki from Yale, Doris Berger from the Academy Museum of Motion Pictures, professor Paul Lerner and librarian Michaela Ullmann from USC. 
Fazili and Hussaini, who currently live in Germany, attended the event virtually via Zoom alongside their translator Zahir Rashed. 
Lerner opened the night with some contextual information about the international migrant crisis and more specifically, the problems arising from Afghanistan. 
“At the end of 2020, over 80 million people have been forcibly displaced worldwide, meaning that one out of every 91 people has had to flee their home” Lerner said. “It’s clear that forced migration is among the greatest challenges facing the world today. But the numbers do not tell the whole story. ‘Midnight Traveler’ provides an intimate glimpse into the human side of just one of these millions of stories.”
Ullmann thanked all the event contributors, including the filmmakers, translator and moderators. Wardaki also discussed the warped view of Afghanistan in the Westernized world. 
She then listed off the general themes that taint many Americans’ opinion of Afghanistan. According to Wardaki, this included the reemergence of the Taliban, the weak Afghan governments that were essentially puppets under the United States’ influence and radical Islamic believers. In addition to this context, she also recognized the biases of Westernized education systems. 
“I always like to remind my students as scholars, we are often complicit in this image and in perpetuating this image of Afghanistan,” Wardaki said.
The first clip from “Midnight Traveler” showed Fazili and Hussaini’s children on an amusement park swing ride, with a voiceover in Farsi. This voice described the film as the family’s “journey to the edge of hell.” After playing this scene in the theater, Fazili opened up about his inspiration for the film. 
“Much bigger filmmakers are running after film ideas, but we didn’t do that. At this drought, we found that this documentary idea found us,” Fazili said. 
When asked about the role their children played in the film, Fazili encouraged his wife to answer, as she had looked after the children while he focused more on the process of documentation. She described her experience raising a family while being a refugee. 
“Hassan told us all that from the beginning, that it’s a very challenging journey. We have to get ready for that,” Hussani said. “Beside all the trouble we were facing on this route, the only thing I, as a mother, was trying to do was keep the children hopeful for a bright future.” 
The final topic covered was religion. In the panel, Fazili and Hussaini considered how their personal beliefs have changed over time. A clip revealed a key conversation between Fazili, Hussaini and their eldest daughter, Nargis. As Fazili pans the camera to his wife, Hussaini claims that her open mindedness influenced her husband’s newfound progressive opinions. The most notable interaction in this video, however, was not between husband and wife, but mother and daughter. Hussaini empowers her daughter by allowing her to choose whether she wears her hijab when the family arrives in Europe. 
“I won’t cover my head, and it won’t be anybody’s business,” Nargis replies in the clip. 
Realizing the weight of her words, Nargis sheepishly looked to her mother, who approve this bold choice. The little girl screamed with joy and relief and embraced her mother. 
About this moment in the film, Hussaini said, “I still prefer to have my hijab, but in relation to my daughters, I have a different view. I would love to let them be free to decide for themselves — whatever they want to believe and give them the freedom to have their own clothing.”
In the last clip, the family has arrived in Eastern Europe. The daughters play in a grass field. Fatima showcases her newly acquired bike-riding skills with a beaming smile across her face. 
The family still faces uncertainty to this day. Nearing the end of this speaker event, Berger asked Fazili and Hussaini if Germany would be their desired permanent location and Fazili said no. He finds the general population accepting but dislikes the governmental policies toward refugees. 
In one of the film’s closing scenes, Fazili says, “For us, these dreams have become a mirage.”
Concluding on this poignant note, “Midnight Traveler” serves as a reminder of the ongoing migrant crisis and the human stories behind the media’s often sensationalized coverage of Afghan people.

I spent my entire Saturday on Delta flight 3634. While many of you flew to the Bay to tailgate, I embarked on my ill-fated trip with the hopes of conducting field research. Like many, I’ve found USC students who hail from the Bay ever so enigmatic and, more importantly, annoying. As social determinism’s biggest fan, I figured the most effective way to both understand and anticipate the behavior of their kind is to go to their home.
But, just like the insular Bay Area students who spurn outsiders, the San Francisco fog made it impossible for my pilot to land. After circling the area a few times, I was taken back to Los Angeles International Airport, shocked and left to think about the entire fiasco’s metaphorical undertones.
Many on this campus have lost endless minutes to the rambles of students who can’t stop talking about their Northern California hometowns. Others have been left wondering whether their meager 100 LinkedIn connections would ever compare to the high school student with 500+ and three internships under their belt. Some have looked on distantly as students, some more capable dancers and others utterly rhythmically challenged, began to “smeeze” in public, unprovoked.
It’s not a question of if you’ll be victimized by a Bay Area student, but when. These are all instances of what I call Bay Area-induced delusion, and if you’ve experienced any of these situations, you may be entitled to financial compensation.  
Kids from the Bay love where they’re from — sometimes a little too much for the rest of us.
“I guess you don’t really like your city if you’re not going to rep it that hard,” said Makkonen Haile, a sophomore from El Sobrante, Calif. majoring in computer science and business administration.
And there does seem to be a lot to love. Every Bay Area student I spoke to reveled in the fact that they grew up in a culturally diverse land. Many felt their racial and ethnic backgrounds were embraced in their hometowns, especially because of the Bay’s high percentage of Asian, African and Latinx immigrants and rich African American history.
Haile, in particular, lights up while talking about the Habesha community in the Bay Area. He finds home not just in the Bay but in the people who remind him of his heritage. 
“There’s a very large Habesha community in the Bay Area — I’d say mostly comprised in Oakland,” Haile said. “It really forms that community between you and a whole group of people, even though you’re not really back in Eritrea or back in Ethiopia, which is very, very comforting.” 
Ashley Chough, a senior majoring in communication, echoing a similar sentiment, said she felt most comfortable growing up around other Asian people, and specifically other Korean people. 
“I studied abroad in Paris, my freshman year, I was part of the [Trojan Transfer Plan] program,” Chough said. “It was more of a cultural shock to just realize how little support that you can receive as a person of color when you go to a white majority school.” 
Students were more than aware of the Bay’s competitive reputation. Junior Zaid Hassan, a San Jose native majoring in cinematic arts, film and television production, and Haile both described different tactics, from early-learning courses to private college counselors, employed by many Bay Area parents to get their children an edge over others.
“I would be learning for the first time in school, like a normal person, right? Or you’d think. But then everyone in my class is already like, years ahead of me,” Hassan said. “I’d always be like, ‘Wait … How are you guys on multiplication? I’m still learning addition.’ And they’re like, ‘Oh, my mom put me in summer school the past four years.’”
These parents appear to be less narrow-minded and more anxious than anything. The Bay Area parent is not merely projecting onto their children, but, oftentimes, imbuing their children with the same standards they held for themselves. As Haile notes, many are the same parents who were the first in their family to leave their country.
“They’re the parents who are sturdy enough and cutthroat enough to make the move and take that step,” Haile said. “To start a whole new life in a totally different country.”
Although our immigrant parents may fall perfectly into the meritocratic “best of the best” mantra that pervades the Bay, they can’t be held responsible for creating the environment that forms the LinkedIn fiends they call their children.
Few things are more sobering than realizing you’ll never be able to afford to live where you grew up. Although Bay Area students expressed varying degrees of family pressure, most of them pointed toward the prominence of industry and gentrification as a source of anxiety.
“If you want to buy a nice house to live in a nice neighborhood, it’s going to cost you like $2 [million] to $3 million in San Jose, which is insane. Who has that money?” Hassan said. “Yeah, nobody has the money other than the computer engineer, which is why everyone’s going into computer engineering.”
It’s easy to indulge in the idea of first-generation students being at the full mercy of their parents. The trope can be a great distraction — even amusing — and has a very real existence, even outside the Bay — trust me, I’d know.
But, maybe growing up around Patagonia and Allbirds is far more traumatizing than sitting through another one of dad’s end-of-the-school-year lectures. Although I journeyed to the Bay with the intent of understanding the social determinism behind the most toxic among us, this is a matter, like many, better understood through the lens of technological determinism.
The existing meritocratic beliefs of individuals are not to blame; instead, it’s the technocracy of Silicon Valley bros trickling down onto unsuspecting children, whom we now know as computer science-business administration-chemical engineering triple majors.
So the next time we question why our Bay Area bestie refuses to develop a personality beyond being a workaholic, remind yourself that their future’s have always been a bit foggier than ours (*ba dum tss*). Knowing this, their unending Bay-Area-speak sounds less like a pathetic conversation starter and more like the mourning of a reality that increasingly slips away.

The coronavirus pandemic changed our lives in March 2020. At the time, a vaccine seemed far away and, for many, a pipe dream that would come to fruition in a few years.
However, because researchers have developed coronavirus vaccines for half a decade, producing a safe and effective SARS-CoV-2 vaccine did not entail starting from square one, which explains how we were graced with it so promptly. 
Despite scientific evidence that the coronavirus vaccine is safe for recipients ages five and above, the resulting vaccine mandates have espoused controversy in virtually every corner of the United States. The prevailing question is why, and why now?
It is important to note, before examining the partisan divisions in opinions on vaccines, that a host of marginalized communities have expressed valid apprehension against the vaccine due to the way the medical community has taken advantage of them. 
As relayed by Pew Research, “Mandatory childhood immunizations have been a feature of American society since the 19th century.” In the 19th century, scientific technology was not nearly as advanced as it is today with Dmitri Mendeleev just developing the periodic table. 
In 2021, we face the same tacit resistance against science from over a hundred years ago. This time around, it is split starkly between political parties.
In a piece from the New York Times, “Vaccination Mandates Are an American Tradition. So Is the Backlash,” writer Maggie Astor compares vaccine requirements and their coupling backlash between now and past centuries. For example, the smallpox vaccine prompted a response similar to the backlash against the coronavirus vaccine as parents protested school vaccination requirements. 
Although immunizations were marginally riskier than they are today, scientists develop them to prevent greater harm from the disease in question. Nonetheless, many people saw severe illness as preferable because of their obstinate subscription to the contested concept of liberty. 
According to the Kaiser Family Foundation, the chilling reality is that vaccine attitudes are split among partisan lines: “As of September 13, 2021, 52.8% of people in counties that voted for Biden were fully vaccinated compared to 39.9% of Trump counties, a 12.9 percentage point difference. While the rate of vaccination coverage has slowed in both county groups, the gap has widened over time.” 
These statistics are troubling for a variety of reasons, but mainly because party politics blur the line between science and political opinion. In a country that has only become more polarized, we cannot afford such disagreements that lead to a life or death situation. 
In a collaborative study from Brown University and Stanford University, researchers found that, in comparison with other democracies including Canada, the United Kingdom, Germany and Australia, the U.S. is politically polarizing at a higher rate. We have to fight against this trend, but as vaccines become yet another issue that divides us, a resolution seems farther off. 
Why have party politics devolved into disagreements on public health and science? It is true that there is a partisan divide in certain scientific issues such as climate change. 
However, the pandemic has directly affected everyone and we all saw its devastating effects with our own eyes. Nonetheless, the decision to get vaccinated and end this pandemic is divided in a partisan way. Considering the general contention that accompanies the vaccine, it will be more difficult to fight this harmful polarization via productive conversations. 
For one possible solution, universities could implement non-partisan information sessions at colleges and universities that address the questions and concerns young people may have about the vaccine. If we educate more young people about the vaccine, they can relay that information to other people in their life.
Another possibility would be for politicians from all sides of the spectrum to locally convene and host citizen forums to show people that vaccinations are safe for all, regardless of a registered political party. While this seems like a pipe dream considering the polarization between Democrats and Republicans, the reality is that politicians from different political parties come together all the time. 
Our country can move past this difficult moment, as we have several times in history. In fact, this conflict can actually be a catalyst for bipartisan collaboration.
