The issues of misogyny and sexual violence have become  controversial topics of discussion on the USC during the last several weeks, after recent scandals plagued the Greek community.
Take Back the Night, a national event aimed at increasing awareness of sexual and domestic violence, hopes to continue this discussion in a meaningful way with tonight’s event at USC.

“We’re trying to start a conversation about the mentality and culture that is behind these types of incidents,” said Kaitlin Meek, a senior majoring in public relations and the director of public relations for Take Back the Night. “Take Back the Night is coming at a very interesting time this year. It is unfortunate that these events did happen, but it’s nothing new; this mind set has been around forever.”
The Take Back the Night Rally will be held tonight at Tommy Trojan from 6 p.m. to 10:30 p.m. and will feature performances by multiple campus organizations.
The problem of sexual violence is widespread among college campuses in America, according to Todd Henneman, assistant director of the USC Center for Women and Men.
According to a 2005 study conducted by the National Institute of Justice, one in five women in America experiences a rape during college, but less than 5 percent of attempted and completed rapes are brought to the attention of campus authorities and law enforcement.
“There are probably many other sexual assaults that have occurred that we don’t know about, so the statistics only reflect what the students have reported to the university,” Henneman said. “It is very likely that there are other students out there who have been a victim of sexual assault and have never told a university official.”
Meek said she hopes Take Back the Night will counteract this culture of silence associated with sexual and domestic violence.
“This has become such a taboo subject in our culture, even though it’s something that affects virtually everyone, either directly or indirectly,” Meek said. “There’s a lot of controversy that surrounds this issue, and a lot of times people don’t want to accept it because it’s hard for them to do so.”
Take Back the Night also hopes to get men involved in the conversation about sexual and domestic violence.
“A lot of times guys are afraid that if they talk about sexual assault, they will be seen as a perpetrator,” Henneman said. “We’re trying to get males to take a visible stance and be role models, saying ‘I’m not afraid to stand up and say this is something we don’t support.’”
Najee Ritter, a junior majoring in theatre and president of Alpha Phi Alpha fraternity, which will be performing at Take Back the Night, said he believes men should play a more active role in voicing their views on this issue.
“Our presence [at Take Back the Night] shows that we care, we are concerned, and we vow to never engage in these harmful activities,” Ritter said. “Women need to know that we support them, that we love them and because of this, we have made a conscious decision never to hurt them.”
The push for reform across USC has been a major goal for the events associated with Take Back the Night, which Meek hopes will encourage people to start an open discussion about sexual violence.
“These conversations are finally beginning to emerge among college students, so I just hope that Take Back the Night can be seen as a symbol of hope by them,” Meek said.
Previously the administration had recommended fraternities and sororities require at least 50 percent of their members to attend the rally.
Pat Lauer, president of the USC Interfraternity Council, said the groups ultimately decided to forgo this requirement.
“Greek attendance at Take Back the Night shouldn’t be viewed as another item on a checklist for improving our image, but as a legitimate desire that we hope to instill within many of our members to become more aware of and educated about sexual violence,” Lauer said.
The Take Back the Night Rally tonight will include an opening performance by Women’s Theatre Organization, performances by USC MenCare, the Center for Women and Men, Alpha Phi Alpha Fraternity and poet and activist Andrea Gibson. At 8 p.m. there will be a candlelight march through campus.
Ava, I love the exposed bra strap.  Just plain sexy!
If students would rather attend a school where no one addresses the issues of sexual violence and misogyny that most certainly exist there, let them. I’m proud to call myself a student at an institution where this kind of dialogue is not only allowed, but encouraged. I only wish that the people who needed to hear it most would attend. Sadly, the Greek community doesn’t seem to think it’s important.
Wow, you are a jerk. Sure, some of what takes place at the rally is one sided and liberal. But what about the women who have suffered and been abused? Should these issues not be addressed?
I accept that I am a jerk. Doesn’t bother me at all. I also don’t care about hearing women’s stories about suffering and abuse. It will in no way impact my behavior or conscience, and it only causes congestion that gets in my way. So no, I don’t think that these issues should be addressed publicly. Therapists exist for a reason; if you need one, let me know. There are plenty in the area.
I am in shock that someone would write such an offensive and ignorant comment on an article about an event for which the sole purpose is to help people who are afraid to speak out about their problems/experiences. Since you think you know so much about private counselling and the effects of sexual abuse, does this mean you were abused? and you know what it feels like? ‘Cause if not, do you really have the authority to make such unjustified right-wing slander?
I am in a fraternity, and I am ashamed of the stereotypes cast upon the greek system, but those stereotypes are unfortunately justified by the shameless misogynists like you who are the bane of our society.
What a great image to show off to the prospective students and their parents who will be attending Explore USC today. Who wouldn’t want to go to a school with protests like this that purport to “advance [a] dialogue,” but really do nothing more than provide a forum for people who wrongly perceive themselves to be oppressed to express their one-sided, liberal views?
Sounds like a real party.
A desire to combat sexual violence against woman is absolutely not “liberal,” it would seem you have no understanding of what being liberal or conservative means.
To say that woman who have been SEXUALLY ASSULTED “wrongly perceive themselves to be oppressed” is absurd and is exactly the views that the rally is trying to combat.
I want to go to a school that addresses its deepest problems publicly and at least attempts to hold those responsible accountable and my guess is the majority of students that USC wants to attract in our attempt to become a world class institution, agree with me.
If you really have this little respect for for women and your fellow students, you have no place at an institution of higher learning, please leave so those of us who are interested in fostering a caring, safe environment for everyone can be successful.

A recent report by the National Center for Health Statistics shows college students prefer short no-strings-attached relationships that are short and sexual rather than more committed, long-term relationships.
USC’s Health Promotion and Prevention Services’s yearly national health assessment reports, however, do not reflect an increase in the number of sexual partners for undergraduates or graduates.
“Our data would show that the number of partners has not changed in the last 10 years,” said Paula Swinford, director of HPPS. “As to the quality of relationships, my sense is that in general it is difficult in this day and age to invest time into relationships.”
For some students, casual relationships are easier because individuals can focus on their own lives without having to be responsible for another person.
“Hooking up is definitely more common because it’s easier,” said Natalie Reyes, a junior majoring in international relations. “A lot of people are focusing on developing their careers so it’s easier not to have responsibilities with someone.”
Swinford said she does not think favoring no-strings-attached relationships is a college-specific issue and is not surprised students aren’t looking for serious relationships while they are young.
“You’re not financially on your feet and the age of marriage is trending up for both men and women,” Swinford said.
Some students say they have seen a tendency to engage in casual sex at USC.
“There’s a hookup culture at USC, and that’s why there is a lack of commitment,” said Amy Rasplicka, a freshman majoring in mechanical engineering.”
Anais Ziaemohseni, a freshman majoring in fine arts, said she has found casual hookups to be especially prevalent among college freshmen.
“Many [freshmen] consider it a part of the college experience and that if they are in a committed relationship they are missing out,” Ziaemohseni said. “Many people have just gotten out of committed relationships because they’ve come to college and don’t want to be tied down and miss out on social activities.”
Although the number of partners might not be increasing at USC, research conducted by USC faculty in the psychology department shows college students like to have casual relationships or date for at least one month while in college.
Lynn Miller, a USC professor of communication and psychology, has been conducting ongoing research in which she and her colleagues have found that 98 percent of college students would like to find a sexually exclusive partner at some point in their lives. For college students, however, this could be anywhere from five to 10 years in the future.
“In the interim, although some students say they’d like to have casual relationships, more typically men and women say they’d like to ideally date in relationships over one month,” Miller said.
Miller calls this “promiscuously seeking,” meaning that before adults seek a romantic partner they explore their options and engage in sexual relationships with a number of people before choosing a partner to build an emotional relationship with.
Both Miller and Swinford agree more promiscuous and casual relationships could increase the potential exposure and spread of sexually transmitted diseases if safe-sex practices are not used.
“The more partners you have, the more chance for exposure,” Swinford said.
According to Miller, past relationships can provide both positives and negatives for determining future relationships.
“[Past relationships] provide valuable experiences in learning how to be a good relationship partner. They can help us learn and grow in important ways if we examine and understand our choices,” Miller said. “On the other hand, bad relationship experiences can provide emotional baggage that individuals need to work through so that it doesn’t inadvertently negatively affect their future relationships.”
Hook ups were great back in the day…the last girl that i “hooked up” with somehow ended up married to me for 21 years and we had three kids. Neither of us were looking for any kind of long term relationships. When the right one comes along, you wont have any idea at first…it was a gradual relaization, and here we are 24 years past that hook up, still together.  Hook ups never hurt anyone, and do lead to good things.
The time to me is 02:42 and its Friday 8th April  so I’m from the future
I like watching the videos in my cab . thanks student

A recent report shows that grass is green. “I’ve noticed that, too,” says John Smith, a freshman majoring in something unrelated. Experts say this is because grass contains a green pigment called chlorophyll. “That makes sense,” says Jane Doe, a freshman majoring in something else.
This article is representative of the disgusting culture that has pervaded our generation, our university, and quite frankly, our society as a whole. Where have we gotten to that this is printed as news, and there isn’t outrage and disgust?
Because most of us have a different value structure than you do? This is neither disgusting nor outrageous. Culture is changing. If it disgusts you, do not engage in it. This new trend is not harmful.
trendy?
I think, in general, a noun is missing in this title. I would assert, “Male Students prefer hookups over relationships.” I would disagree that in general females “prefer” hookups to relationships.
If you would like to provide some kind of cited research, or really anything other than anecdotal evidence, I’m almost positive the Daily Trojan would run your correction. Perhaps then your unabashed sexism would be warranted.
Well said.
This is an absolutely asinine comment. You’re being nothing but a hypocritical sexist. Next time, contribute something worthwhile.
Does USC offer awards for Oustanding Levels of Sexism and Hypocrisy? I don’t recall that as an award at graduation…
I think I should have been cited in this article.
[…] the hookup culture? […]

Daily Trojan: What attracted you to the USC men’s golf program? What went into your decision to attend USC?
Martin Trainer: During the recruiting process, I had the option of attending Stanford, Cal, UCLA, or USC. While each one of those schools had their strengths and weaknesses, USC was exceptional due to its elite golf program, coaches and especially the connections that come with being part of the Trojan Family.
 
DT: What is it like to play on a team with so many young guys?
Trainer: Playing on a Division I sports team is an experience I cherish and certainly will never forget. The guys are my brothers — I’ll stay in contact with them forever.
 
DT: The team has always been pretty ambitious about what it hopes to accomplish. What were the team’s goals this year?
Trainer: The team’s goal for this season has not changed. We compete every year to win the National Championship. The entire year is preparation for this championship and winning it would be a dream come true.
 
DT: What are the teams’ biggest strengths?
Trainer: The team’s strengths lie in the overwhelming amount of depth and talent we have from our top six players. Any one of these guys can play at a high level and compete with the best players in the nation.
 
DT: How about you personally?
Trainer: My personal strengths include my work ethic, which I take pride of, and my potential to be a top player. I have improved every year I’ve played golf since I’ve started and I have continued to do so throughout college. I’m highly optimistic that I can be an elite college player and some day a successful touring professional.
 
DT: What are your plans for the future?
Trainer: After college, I plan to play professionally and I intend on spending my remaining time here at USC working hard to prepare for it.

As I watched the NCAA championship game, I could only shake my head in disbelief.
I couldn’t believe what I was seeing. The entire Butler team could not put the ball in the basket, and, as hard as it is to believe, UConn wasn’t much better.
But besides the lack of offensive efficiency both teams, there was something even more disconcerting.
UConn was crowned the 2010-11 NCAA champions.
I’m not saying I despise the Huskies, but it’s what happened leading up to the win that irritates me.
In March 2009, Yahoo! Sports reported UConn violated NCAA rules in recruiting former guard Nate Miles.
Former student manager-turned-sports agent Josh Nochimson provided the four-star recruit from Ohio with lodging, transportation, restaurant meals and representation.
The NCAA found evidence of phone calls and text messages exchanged between Miles, Nochimson and a former UConn assistant coach.
In October 2010, UConn acknowledged the violations that occurred when recruiting Miles, and imposed sanctions on its own men’s basketball program, including a reduction in scholarships in each of the next two seasons and a two-year probation.
UConn coach Jim Calhoun was found guilty for failure to “keep an atmosphere of compliance.”
Sounds familiar, right?
It is eerily close to what happened with the USC men’s basketball program three years ago.
Former guard O.J. Mayo was believed to have accepted improper benefits from Rodney Guillory.
The NCAA, however, had no hard evidence to back up the allegations.
But in January 2010, USC chose to self-impose sanctions, which included a reduction in scholarships, a forfeiture of victories during the 2007-08 season and a four-year probation.
More damaging than the loss of scholarships, though, was a one-year ban on postseason play.
To top it all off, the Trojans also lost five recruits during the NCAA’s investigation, most notably three players who starred in Arizona’s Elite Eight run this March: guard Lamont Jones, forward Solomon Hill and forward Derrick Williams.
In USC’s case, the NCAA decided not to punish the Trojans any further. In UConn’s case, which was rendered in February 2011, the NCAA tacked on another year of probation, reduced the number of scholarships from 13 to 12 and the number of recruiting days for coaches by from 130-90. Calhoun must also miss the first three games of the 2011-12 season.
The biggest difference: UConn was allowed to play in the postseason.
The program didn’t ban itself from postseason play, and apparently, the NCAA thought UConn rightfully had served its punishment.
Nobody cares about a loss of scholarships or a reduction in the coach’s recruiting days — all of that is irrelevant.
Basketball programs can survive with 11 players on a roster, especially an elite program such as UConn’s.
And players just want to play in the postseason; they want to play on the biggest stage known in college basketball known as March Madness.
The NCAA could have banned UConn from the Big East and NCAA tournaments, but it didn’t.
However the NCAA deems what punishments are fair or unfair, it should not provide cheaters with an opportunity to win so easily.
UConn clearly broke the rules, yet now sits atop the collegiate basketball world.
Cheaters should never win, and winners should never cheat.
The pervasive nature of these cheating scandals in collegiate athletics has left a dark cloud over the sport.
But I guess it doesn’t matter anymore. I’m used to this madness by now.

Great article.  We’ll never win the public debate about USC’s just/unjust punishment from the NCAA regarding OJ Mayo and the sanctions.  We lost that battle when Haden and Nikias decided to bend over and follow the appeasement strategy versus the truth.  Just follow what’s going on with McNair and Reggie – The NCAA knows they eff’ed up.  
We all know the NCAA is corrupt and there’s nothing we can do about it.  Hopefully as news of Auburn and the TARP situation come to light, people will finally full understand the severity of what goes on in the SEC and other schools versus what happened with USC and OJ Mayo.
Not only are you a poor writer, but this article is outlandishly biased. Good try.
I was looking forward to reading an article about the NCAA erring, which is often and an enjoyable topic for me.  After all, they always do what is contrary to common sense when dealing with investigations.  Instead, Trevor treated us to journalistic massacre of one sentence paragraph after another of a whine-fest comparing USC’s situation with what happened with the UConn program.
Mayo was trouble. He violated rule and compromised the program ala Reggie Bush.  What was worse was Mayo bailed and left the program in the situation where it lost recruits…which was not part of the self0imposed sanctions, but salt in the wounds.
To compare UConn to USC is laughable.  The entire USC Atheletic Department has done far worse between the two high-profile cases of Bush and Mayo.  UConn, while minor and, as the NCAA called them: “secondary,” UConn’s coaching staff punished themselves.  While the NCAA may be heavy-handed, they were not going to punish current players for minor infractions from five years ago for a player which never even practiced with the team.
I’ve always been a fan of the USC-Notre Dame rivalry, and hold the Trojans in high regard.  This by Mr. Wong is a bitter and desperate attempt feel better about the whoa-is-me mentality around a program that is jealous of not only UConn, but of Arizona.  The Trojans were lucky to make the big dance this year and their prospects for the future are very good.  You don’t have to sully the accomplishments and Arizona and Connecticut.  To call UConn cheaters could only mean that the Trojans for their part are cheaters AND criminals using Wong logic.
I can’t see why you’re arguing there should not be at least some level of discernment by the NCAA. You’re saying there should be no gauging of the level of rules infractions. It’s like saying, it doesn’t matter if you’re caught with 50 kilos of coke, or one ounce marijuana, the punishment should be the same.
Yet the NCAA has a whole classification system for infractions. Some are secondary, and some are major.
You are correct though that the NCAA is inconsistent at times. Consider: Duke’s Corey Maggette was caught taking tens of thousands of dollars, and yet Duke was never ever punished for this.
Nate Miles never played for the University of Connecticut.  That’s why they did not receive a post season ban or have to forfeit any wins.  Completely different scenario with O J Mayo.  I do think that baning student athletes from post season play is a stupid sanction.  They do not deserve to serve punishment for their coaches poor decisions.  I could see the coach being baned from coaching his team in post season play or the player who was involved in the sanction (if still in college) getting baned.  You can’t be disappointed that UConn played in the final game. Kemba Walker was arguably the best player in post season play and their team deserved to be there, just as Butler did.  Thats the beauty of march madness.
Please stop with the one sentence paragraphs.
It doesn’t make the article any stronger.
Really.
You airballed for not mentioning Calipari’s excesses, far more than UCONN’s alleged violations. If Kentucky had won, would you still write the same biased stuff that you wrote here? I think you eat should crow for impartial journalism.
Hey you know the reason that you had to forfeit wins and get a postseason ban it was due to the fact that OJ Mayo dressed and played in games for USC while Nate Miles never took the court for UCONN cause he was expelled from school before the season started. Look at the precedent if an ineligble player suits up for your team your team forfeits the games that he played in. So really there was no precedent to ban uconn since miles never played in a game. 
YOUR JUST JEALOUS CAUSE WE ARE THE NATIONAL CHAMPIONS WHILE USC COULDNT GET OUT OF THE FIRST FOUR HAHAHAHAHAAHAHHAAHAHAHAHAHAHAAHAHAHAHAHAHA

USC freshman quarterback Max Wittek knows he’s inexperienced.
Consequently, he knows that as a 17-year-old, first-year signal caller, big things are expected of him as a potential backup to junior quarterback Matt Barkley come August.
Inexperience · Neither Cody Kessler, Jesse Scroggins nor Max Wittek has taken a snap under center during a college game. This fall, one of them will be asked to replace Mitch Mustain, who was 8-1 in his career as a starter, as USC’s backup quarterback. - Carlo Acenas | Daily Trojan 
“I definitely need to learn a lot more in terms of the playbook and just getting used to the environment of the offense,” Wittek said following Tuesday’s early morning practice. “But I think I’m doing well. Of course, there’s always room for improvement. I just have to get into the playbook and keep studying.”
With a seasoned Barkley essentially guaranteed to start the team’s Sept. 3 season opener at home against Minnesota, Wittek is currently in the midst of a three-way quarterback battle with fellow freshmen Cody Kessler and Jesse Scroggins to supplant a graduating Mitch Mustain as the No. 2 quarterback on the depth chart.
“You’re not looking for that guy to have a 400-yard passing game,” said USC coach Lane Kiffin earlier this spring. “He’s not going to get a lot of repetitions during the week in preparation, so he’s going to be a guy who approaches the game very seriously. He has to be a guy who can go in there at any time and run the offense.”
In other words, Kiffin and quarterbacks coach Clay Helton are looking for a backup who can fill in for Barkley in case of injury.
That’s certainly a plausible scenario; during the last two seasons, Barkley has suffered various ailments that have sidelined him for two games — against Washington in 2009 and Notre Dame in 2010. In those games, USC is 0-2.
Against Washington, then-sophomore Aaron Corp completed just 13-of-22 passes for 110 yards and an interception. USC lost on a last-second field goal, 16-13.
Against Notre Dame, Mustain completed just 20-of-37 passes for 177 yards and an interception. Similarly, USC lost 20-16.
“I guess it’s important for me to stay healthy,” Barkley said with a smile. “But it is important for those guys to be ready as well. Who knows what’ll happen this year. Hopefully more than one of those guys will be ready in case something happens.”
But among the three potential backups, none have taken a snap under center during a college game.
Scroggins, who arrived on campus last fall, redshirted last season and headed the scout team during practices.
Kessler and Wittek, who should technically be picking up corsages for their high school proms, enrolled in January to better grasp the playbook.
“It’s been crucial,” Wittek said of being able to participate in spring practice. “To have that much of an edge on the playbook before coming in the fall is really important. It’s always nice to get used to the entire college environment as well. It’s been good. I feel very comfortable here.”
But although Wittek, who played at Mater Dei High School in Santa Ana, Calif. like Barkley, is most similar to the Trojans’ starter in terms of arm strength, footwork and delivery, Kessler and Scroggins might have the edge this fall.
Statistically, Kessler is among the leaders in terms of completion percentage this spring, while Scroggins, who redshirted in the fall, remains the most experienced of the group.
Accuracy and experience continue to be areas of emphasis for USC’s coaching staff.
But in spite of such circumstances, Kiffin remarked last week there is no pecking order yet, and the trio continues to split snaps evenly.
“We’re pushing them as hard as we can,” Kiffin said. “We’re giving them a lot of reps. It’s great for them to be here.”
Based on talent and past accolades, all are at least serviceable.
Kessler and Wittek were ranked second and third nationally at the quarterback position in Yahoo! Sports’ Rivals.com’s 2011 recruiting class. Similarly, Scroggins was fifth at the position last year.
“We’re all just here just trying to get better,” Kessler said when asked about their past success last week. “Everyone was used to being the main guy and then they come in and learn from someone else and back them up. You can’t let it frustrate you.”
But Barkley, who was also a highly touted high school prospect in 2009, has taken notice of their poise and command after seven spring practices.
“They’re further along than when I was here,” said Barkley, who was a spring enrollee as a freshman, like Kessler and Wittek. “What they’ve learned so far and what they know in the film room, and what they’re saying in regards to protections and the playbook is pretty impressive. They’re playing their butts off.”
 
 
 
 
 
 
Scroggins>Barkley for the long haul.  Barkley will fade in the 2nd half the season, as usual.  When he does, I hope Lane has the brains to put in Scroggins.  Scroggins for Heisman!

From the first track, you can tell even though the Foo Fighters have been around for 16 years, the band’s energy remains just as intact as singer Dave Grohl’s wavy mop of hair.
By the time you get to the end of the band’s new album, Wasting Light, it’s obvious making good rock music is what the  Foo Fighters does best. 
Boasting trademark Grohl screeches, seductive melodies, complex drum beats, engaging chords and one captivating guitar solo, Wasting Light has all the makings of a great Foo Fighters album and a successful rock CD.
The firecracker energy of “Bridge Burning” immediately reels you in. Throughout the album, more emotions and loud noises unfurl.
Though grounded in rock, the tracks in Wasting Light have the ability to woo pop enthusiasts and metal lovers and maybe even cheerleaders.
“Arlandria” starts off with a blast of energy, but unfortunately descends into a cheerleader-friendly singing of phrases like shame, shame go away / come again another day, which sticks in your head. The chorus’ intense screaming later in the song, however, save the song from becoming a completely pop tune.
The album keeps up this tone in “Back and Forth,” which shows a more playful Grohl and has a simple, short chorus.
Though the guitar chords reel you in, this track also has the ability to play over and over in your brain, almost to the point of annoyance.
Taken in a more light-hearted manner, though, the track harkens back to some of the band’s  previous albums and could serve as a welcome respite from the heavier tracks in the album.
“These Days” has more of a folk feel at the beginning with softer vocals from Grohl. The track is a nice balance between a smoother, more thought-provoking and slow melody and a heart-wrenching one where Grohl’s frustration comes through loud and clear with his screaming.
At times, the track can feel like two separate songs mashed together, but it’s this technique that allows the few minutes to express the contradicting emotions.
The song evokes a bitterness similar to that found in the track “Best of You” from their 2005 album In Your Honor.
Both capture a range of emotion that makes it possible for anyone from a disheartened teenager to a tired divorcée to sing along, something the Foo Fighters have down.
The one track that will manage to win over almost any listener and leave an imprint is “I Should Have Known,” a love ballad about being broken-hearted.
The premise sounds cheesy and cliché, but the Foo Fighters’ delivery makes it anything but.
It’s the type of bluesy track you’d expect to be performed by a disgruntled man armed with a guitar inside a dingy saloon or burlesque club. And that’s exactly what you get, in all the right ways.
The song is simply produced, leaving Grohl’s voice and clean instrumentals to get the message across sans studio magic and auto-tune.
Though it does not jell with the expected Foo Fighters sound, the changes are positive and you can still hear cymbal crashes in the background sprinkled over Grohl’s emotion-loaded voice.
The drum gets the spotlight for a few moments, adding a welcome rhythm change.
The biggest star is still Grohl’s voice, which takes the worn expression no, I cannot forgive you yet and transforms it with layers of emotion communicated with various pitch changes.
This is not necessarily the album that defines the band, but it is a work that fits well into the chronology of Foo Fighters works. In other words, it’s another album to add to an already solid collection.
The guys manage to stay grounded in strong rock roots, while still speaking to almost every human emotion a listener can experience.
Wasting Light, as Grohl puts it in “Back & Forth” has a lot of nerve.
 
 
“The song is simply produced, leaving Grohl’s voice and clean instrumentals to get the message across sans studio magic and auto-tune.”
They didn’t use computers, its all analog, done on tape in a garage. No studio magic or anything, just the Foos

SONG OF THE WEEK:
“Grow Ocean” — Fleet Foxes  Streaming at Pitchfork.com
Seattle’s Fleet Foxes has shut itself in the studio for several long  months, following the success of its self-titled LP. Now, the neo-folk quintet is back with “Grow Ocean,” the first single from its forthcoming sophomore album, Helplessness Blues.
At once thunderous and harmonic, the track boasts thicker arrangements of acoustic guitars and organs than the band’s previous work, at times comparable to recent work by Jónsi and Grizzly Bear. But those unmistakable vocal harmonies remain, soaring over the chords and hilltops to the song’s stripped-down closing words.
If anything, “Grow Ocean” is convincing evidence that frontman Robin Pecknold and Co. are alive, well and fostering a beastly spring release.
 
 
MOVIE SCREENING OF THE WEEK:
Made In Austin, Day One: A Night with Richard Linklater
Cinefamily — Friday — 8 p.m.
Hollywood might be slowly imploding under ballooning budgets and poor theater attendance, but independent cinema is still alive. As if foreshadowing the downfall of the studios, Texas-bred indie film forefather Richard Linklater will visit the Cinefamily this Friday night for a discussion, along with screenings of his own Slacker and SubUrbia.
Set in the sun-blasted neighborhoods of Austin, Linklater’s hometown, Slacker spins a series of non-linear, hysterical vignettes about the city’s social outcasts. Highlights include a JFK conspiracy theorist, a house burglar who has befriended the aging anarchist he once attempted to rob and a woman with a Madonna pap smear poster to sell.
SubUrbia offers a similar, if darker, take on writer Eric Bogosian’s birthplace of Woburn, Massachusetts, where the locals gather at the corner convenience store, waiting for a miracle to latch onto.
The event begins at 8 p.m. Tickets are $10.
 
 
ENTERTAINMENT NEWS OF THE WEEK:
Joe Wright slams sexist Sucker Punch
With his new Chemical Brothers-scored teenage assassin thriller Hanna in theaters, British director Joe Wright isn’t pulling any punches when it comes to his opinion on Zack Snyder’s action picture.
“For me, one of the main issues in terms of womens’ place in society and feminism is the sexual objectification of women,” Wright said to Movie Line on Sunday. “That’s something that feminists in the ’70s tried to fight against but has been totally lost in the 21st century consumer-celebrity world. So for me, when I look at the poster for Sucker Punch it seems actually incredibly sexist, because it is sexually objectifying women regardless of if they can shoot you or not.”
Though destined to inflame Snyder’s fans, Wright does make an articulate point. This isn’t the first time a Snyder film has been accused of morally heinous idealism. His earlier 300 was accused of being fascist and Islamophobic by detractors. Might we be seeing a pattern here?

There’s a new restaurant spicing up the culinary scene in Little Tokyo.
Just like most of its neighboring restaurants, The Spice Table, a Singaporean- and Vietnamese-inspired eatery opened less than a month ago by former Pizzeria Mozza chef-de-cuisine Bryant Ng, is small, hip and artsy.
Nom nom · The Spice Table, located in Little Tokyo, serves up dishes like the Otah, which is mackarel and coconut milk in a banana leaf. - Sophia Lee | Daily Trojan 
Parking is still atrocious. Prices are still high. And yes, it’s another Asian eatery in Little Tokyo.
But you won’t find the typical sushi or fusion cuisine here, because The Spice Table is one of the few places in Los Angeles that serves traditional Singaporean dishes.
But Ng and his Vietnamese wife Kim are returning to their Southeastern roots, and they are delivering all spices with no mercy.
Ng, a Los Angeles native, travels back to his Singaporean heritage by dishing up local favorites like the famous Hainanese chicken rice and the spicy, coconut-based noodle soup, laksa.
These dishes are a far cry from the Italian dishes in his previous culinary career, in which he worked alongside well-known chefs like Daniel Boulud and Roland Passot.
The Spice Table, as the name might suggest, is not a comfortable place for spice-wimps.
The dishes are packed with flavor, and as you wipe away tears and the sweat from the heat, you find yourself coming close to dining at something like the noisy, non-air-conditioned hawker centers — chaotic places to find cheap food, found in Singapore.
Most of the dishes on the Ng’s menu are derived from the mom-and-pop stalls of these ubiquitous, open-air food complexes that are cramped under the high-rise apartment buildings in Singapore.  
With its fashionably exposed brick walls, clean wooden tables and bare light bulbs encased in traditional birdcages, The Spice Table hardly stays true to the ambience of hawker centers, but it does stay true to the cuisine.
Grilled, smoky satay? Check. Chunks of chicken in rich, coconut gravy? Check.
Lots and lots of complex, deliriously wonderful spices? Check, check and check.
A must-try is the Otah, a pate of mackerel, coconut milk and various spices, wrapped in banana leaf and then grilled until the fragrance of the crackling leaf infuses into the spicy, fleshy concoction.
Another Singaporean favorite (practically the national dish) is the chicken rice.
It’s made with minimal spices except for garlic and ginger, leaving the spotlight on the chicken.
Every grain of buttery rice is coated with chicken fat for maximum flavor, and the piece of chicken thigh on top is so perfectly cooked that the tiniest poke of a fork effortlessly peels the tender flesh away from the bone.
Make sure you dip some of the chicken meat into the trio of dipping sauces that come with the dish: a garlic-cilantro sauce, a sweet sticky soy sauce and sambal, Singapore’s favorite chili paste.
You can even suck on the bone marrow to extract more precious flavor from the dish if nobody’s watching.
Not all the dishes are of Singaporean origin, such as the fried cauliflower. But it will be a wasted trip if you don’t try the dish.
Fat florets of cauliflower are battered, deep-fried and served hot and crispy with a sprinkle of fried cilantro. On the side is a sweet, salty and garlicky fish sauce.
It’s the gourmet, slightly healthier version of dipping tater tots in ketchup, except using chopsticks and paying $7 for a plate.
But it’s worth every penny; the dish will make you want to start deep-frying every vegetable you eat.
The Spice Table also offers a modest menu of beer and wine, as well as Vietnamese coffee.
Pop a bottle of Tiger beer (Singapore’s first locally brewed beer) with a snack dish of fried peanuts and anchovies.
These anchovies are casual, dried and crispy tidbits, a far cry from the fancy Italian ones.
Other snacks include mouth-watering, spice-rubbed morsels of sambal-fried potatoes and crispy fried chicken wings that pack a distinct, spicy punch.
Because The Spice Table takes reservations and is new, expect a crowd.
The place is cramped and loud, and certainly not an ideal place for romantic or intimate conversations.
But at The Spice Table, the food will probably be the prime topic of conversation, and the only thing you want to be intimate with anyway.

Cliché or not, eating food from dusty metal cans and assorted plastic containers is as endemic to college life as hangovers and cram sessions.
The typical convenience-based, borderline-desperate college diet can be summed up by images of microwave-nuked Chef Boyardee and little cans of Vienna sausage.
Many of these metal-can or plastic-packaged foods, however, come with a nasty downside: Bisphenol A, or BPA.
You’ve likely seen water bottles or baby bottles boasting they are “BPA-free,” and for good reason: Countless studies have found BPA to be a factor for hormonal issues, neurological problems, reproductive system problems, breast cancer and other conditions.
Now, researchers at the Breast Cancer Fund and Silent Spring Institute, which deals with breast cancer concerns, have found eating canned or plastic-packaged foods instead of fresh foods can significantly increase BPA levels in individuals.
This increased exposure is because of the leaching of BPA from the resin lining the inside of these containers, and it’s no small increase: The study found an average growth in BPA levels of 60 percent in those who consumed canned or plastic-packaged foods regularly.
Consumer Reports took a look last year at what sort of BPA levels popular canned foods contained.
High levels were found in Progresso’s vegetable soup, as well as Campbell’s condensed chicken noodle.
Del Monte Fresh Cut Green Beans took the trophy, however, with an average of 123.5 parts per billion of BPA in one serving.
For a 165-pound individual, this one serving of canned green beans equates to BPA exposure of 85 times the Food and Drug Administration’s recommended amount per day.
And for whatever reason, the United States government hasn’t stepped in to do anything about it. Unlike governments in China, Europe, Canada and the United Arab Emirates have all banned BPA from children’s food products.
It’s hard to believe the FDA’s proposal to deem BPA a “chemical of concern” has not been approved, considering the extensive research pointing to one thing: BPA is a harmful chemical.
It’s not like there aren’t alternatives to BPA-leeching-prone resin coatings.
Between 1998 and 2003, Japan’s canning industry changed its resin to BPA-free polyethylene terephtalate linings as well as another epoxy lining, which in this case inhibited leaching of BPA into foods (even though it wasn’t fully BPA-free).
What happened after Japan’s change?
Researchers following Japanese college students noticed quite a drastic difference: They recorded decreases in BPA exposure of more than 50-percent in these students after the canning industry’s switch.
In this country, however, change in how BPA is used in packaging and canning doesn’t appear on the horizon, even with more studies showing unacceptable mainstream levels of BPA exposure.
Obviously, this  poses a dilemma for college students strapped for time and money.
And in this scenario, the issue of canned foods becomes difficult for everyone, not just college students on a budget.
A homemade marinara sauce, for instance, is often a result of  canned tomatoes.
Pasta dishes sometimes call for canned fish.
Even fresh soups can require canned ingredients like chicken broth.
There are ways to reduce the intake of canned foods which will help you limit BPA exposure and maybe eat better, too.
Beans are tasty, but there’s no reason to be heating up that salt-flooded canned pork and beans.
Find a block of time when you’ll be home for a few hours and cook some yourself. The night before, soak beans in a bowl with cold water.
The next day, just chop up some onion, garlic, bell pepper and carrot, and sauteé with plenty of bacon.
Throw in the beans and pour in enough cold water to cover them, then bring the beans to a simmer and let them cook for however long it takes to get them nice and tender.
Now you have a boatload of beans that can be refrigerated or frozen, and can be easily consumed for the next week or even longer.
Chicken soup?
A similar process: Add pieces of dark-meat chicken, like thighs and drumsticks, to a pot and toss in handfuls of diced onion, carrot and celery, along with some garlic or a bay leaf.
Season with salt and pepper, cover with water, bring the pot to a boil and then turn down the heat to a bare simmer.
Keep an eye on it while you’re studying and let it cook for about an hour.
When the meat is tender, you’re good to go.
That big batch of soup with juicy chicken and a delicate broth, will be ready to be eaten or refrigerated for later.
Best of all? No BPA.

Watson previously worked at Keck’s development office before moving to the Saint John’s Health Center and John Wayne Cancer Institute.
“I am delighted Bill Watson has returned to USC and joined our team,” Checcio said in a press release. “Having such a talented fundraiser and manager  overseeing our efforts gives us a tremendous advantage at this stage of  our campaign planning.”
Watson’s job will not stop at overseeing development functions at  various university institutions. He will also work to  collaborate with leaders at other USC health schools and bringing their  diverse fundraising interests together.
“I’ll be working with the school of pharmacy, dentistry, occupational  therapy and physical therapy,” Watson said. “Many times faculty of  those places have overlapping interests.”
When Watson was the chief development officer at USC’s Keck School of Medicine, he raised money for the Zilkha Neurogenetic Institute, the USC Norris Comprehensive Cancer Center, the Broad Center for Regenerative Medicine and Stem Cell Research and the Keck School.
At Saint John’s, Watson helped raise $300 million for a new treatment center.
Watson said he grew up hating USC because of his family’s sports  allegiances and was embarrassed to tell his friends he worked for Norris  Cancer center in 1988. Watson has since had a change of heart.
“Being a Trojan gets in your blood,” Watson said as he held up a mug  that read ‘Once a Trojan, always a Trojan.’ “I worked with Nikias  before, so I’m excited to work with him.”
Watson said he is happy to return to the Trojan family.
“I’m excited to be back at USC,” Watson said. “The university has  taken great strides in the past few years to advance the mission of the  Health Sciences campus, and I’m eager to address the challenge of taking  USC’s recent success even further.”
Dennis Jenkins, a graduate student studying public health, said he  remembers hearing  about Watson’s fundraising work around USC before he  left to work in Santa Monica.
“To hear a name being tossed around at such a huge university, I’d  say that proves he’s done some great things in the past,” Jenkins said.

Fixing “Take Back the Night”
 
As a junior at USC, I have been around three years of the Women’s Student Assembly and the Center for Women and Men’s admirable, weeklong effort designed to raise awareness about sexual violence.
As a brother of a beautiful sister, son of a beautiful mother, a friend of many beautiful women on this campus and a follower of Christ, I care deeply about violence against women.
Yet each year for the same reason, I find myself unable to take the event seriously or to actively take part in it.
The way the WSA has chosen to draw attention to itself (you know, with the giant — you know what I’m talking about … with “this is not a target” bannered across it — yeah, that) is entirely counterproductive to the overall objective.
Sure, it’s funny. Sure, it gets attention. But we are dealing with a serious issue, and one that deserves serious attention, not the awkward leering glances of drooling adolescent boys.
I am not saying it’s impossible to keep a lighthearted spirit and the ability to laugh in the midst of a serious problem; I think it is important and healthy to do so. What I am saying is it draws attention in the wrong fashion.
A major part of stopping sexual violence is in changing the way we view women. Women are much more than sexual objects, and although “this is not a target” is the correct message to be sending, the way it’s communicated still perpetuates the view that “this is, in fact, a target.” It is not only the biggest part of the display, it is the lasting image that will stick in your mind when you think about this week.
I also think it is worth considering how this is representing USC to prospective students, visiting parents and the community as a whole.
If USC MenCare put up a giant wooden male counterpart next to Tommy for an entire week, I can virtually guarantee visiting parents would be calling Student Affairs.
Women’s Student Assembly, I am on your side. I want to see an end to sexual violence.
And maybe I’m just a prude, but could you make it a little easier for me to be a part of this next year, without having to associate myself with the unnecessary sign?
 
Jesse Mentz
Junior, international relations
Why is there an appropriate place for a cardboard vagina? Who should decide what that is? You, Jesse? It’s the 1st amendment and stupid squeamishness over a VAGINA shouldn’t stop you taking on an incredibly important cause. In fact it is a very very trivial thing to ‘care’ about in light of what has been going on recently and people’s attempt to do something about it.
I’m not sure what the problem is here.  I happen to love the vagina
As someone who directly organizes Take Back the Night every year, I can tell you that the vagina (go ahead and use the word!) is just like Lauren said – a beautiful thing. It is so much more than a sexual object. It is something to be honored. I
I love that no one is the least bit uncomfortable with all the phallic symbols on campus.
I fully support the statement that the giant wooden cutout is indeed saying, “this IS a target,” and in the very least, “this is a funny/public thing.” The female anatomy (and the male anatomy for that part) is something precious and beautiful and to be protected and honored–I believe that Men Care and the WSA would agree with this statement (correct me if I’m wrong). The wooden cutout does not say this; it crudely depicts it and robs it of it’s privacy, intimacy, and value. I’d be happy to say good-bye to that thing.
You seem to miss the point of the letter.  The letter agrees that there is need to bring attention to sexual health and sexual violence.  The issue he brings up is not just simply the method, it’s the fact that this method’s success depends on nearly the same thing that leads to sexual violence, that people view women as sexual objects.  
The point is best summed up in the line:
 “…“this is not a target” is the correct message to be sending, the way it’s communicated still perpetuates the view that “this is, in fact, a target.””
I don’t follow…
The author made many points. I didn’t specifically address the point you call attention to, frankly, because I don’t understand it.
In all sincerity, how does an oversized depiction of female anatomy perpetuate the view that “this is, in fact, a target”?
Hypothetically, if Men Care decided to host a table promoting the sexual health of men, and we decided to call attention to our table with an oversized penis, would you suggest we were objectifying men? Does the mere depiction of genitalia imply “this is, in fact, a target”?
As long as we’re addressing this particular point, I would also suggest the author illustrates another reason to continue using the prop. If the depiction creates a “lasting image that will stick in your mind” that “this is not a target” then I would contend it has effectively served its purpose.
Without knowing the motivations of the WSA or the Take Back the Night committee, even if the sole intention of the organizers’ use of the giant “you know what” was to garner attention for the cause, I fully endorse and encourage it’s use.
The issues of sexual health and sexual violence need all the attention they can get, and if the biggest criticism of the methods employed is that they raise a few eyebrows or cause a few awkward glances, I think that’s a fair price to pay. If “it” weren’t there, how many more people would have walked past without even a moment of reflection?
With regards to prospective students, parents and the greater community, I would suggest that a student population passionate about social justice would be selling point. Many prospective students are looking for a campus with opportunities to promote awareness and inspire change in their communities.
Having been a member of Men Care for more than three years, I fully recognize that the topics of sexual health and sexual violence can be difficult to confront and discuss in an open forum… but it’s even more difficult when you can’t bring yourself to say, or type, the word vagina. 
I sincerely hope the mere sight of “it” isn’t the only thing preventing you from actively supporting a cause that you care deeply about. We need your help.
Is that really the kind of attention that should be drawn, though? A giant wooden cutout seems to suggest that the cause is the protection of a woman’s sexual organs as opposed to a woman herself. It’s a crude, cheap attention grabber that objectifies women solely by their genitalia and overwhelmingly diminishes the severity of such an urgent cause. Don’t we really want to say that women are MORE than their vaginas? This cutout captures the essence of  the metonymical equation woman=vagina. We would be better served to promote woman’s humanity and gather attention in a more intelligent, tender way.
Actually, you have it all wrong. The vagina (why does everyone seem so embarrassed about using that word? VAGINA VAGINA VAGINA) is a rather integral part of the human body. It is not merely a sexual object or a “sheath for a sword” (which is the literal translation of the origin of the word “vagina”). And the display (which is used every year by the Vagina Monologues, the Women’s Theatre Organization, Love Your Body Day, MenCare, and many other fine organizations at USC) is a way of protesting the idea that the vagina is merely a sexual object. It isn’t. It is absolutely a beautiful thing, and we want to promote a culture that honors women AND women’s bodies for more than just sex. At the same time, we want to break down the barriers that tell women “you should be ashamed of your body, your sexuality, and especially that thing between your legs.”
Men are allowed to use their penises as symbols of power and dominance all the time, not to mention for violence and hatred as well. What is wrong with women being proud of their bodies, their sexuality, and yes their vaginas? The point of having the display is to force people to talk about it and stop perpetuating the stigma. WOMEN HAVE VAGINAS. GET OVER IT. Women have sex. Women have sexual desires. But they are also more than sexual objects. We have agency. We have voices. And the vagina needs to be seen as more than just an orifice for some guy to stick his dick into. Period.
Clearly we understand the purpose of Take Back the Night in very different ways. As I see it (and as the event defines it), this is about “promoting awareness of and protesting against sexual violence.” This is not a men v. women, penis v. vagina, campaign, nor is it rooted in symbolism or innuendo. Instead it works to “empower men and women to feel safe in their communities” and equip them with the mindset to combat sexual aggression. With that purpose in mind, a giant vagina cutout–as I argued earlier–is counterproductive and makes Take Back the Night more about ego than compassion for victims of violence.
The vagina display is specifically used for the Sexual Health Fair and the Violence Abroad Fair every year. How is it inappropriate for either of those venues? Sexual health…healthy sex…healthy vagina…If we can pass out condoms and lube on campus without anyone ranting about it being inappropriate, why is it wrong to have an anatomical depiction of the vagina at the same event? For the violence abroad fair, we traditionally use it to be able to explain what Female Genital Cutting is, as we typically have a display describing that form of violence.
I know exactly what TBtN is about. I have been intimately involved in organizing and facilitating the event for 3 years. And there is no doubt in my mind that the vagina display fits perfectly with the message of the events where it is present. It has been around since 2004 and has been used every year by multiple campus organizations that see the value and benefit of having it at their events.
I never said this is about “men v. women,” but people don’t get this upset about phallic images anywhere (seriously, look around our campus…they are everywhere). Having one image of one vagina during two days of ONE week a year is not a big deal. Part of combating sexual violence is allowing women to own their sexuality and own their bodies. It is about granting women the freedom and venue to love themselves, love their bodies, and learn that they have the right to say no AND the right to say “hell yes!” Take Back the Night is by no means just confined to screaming “no means no!” We encourage consent and communication. We encourage healthy relationships, healthy sex lives (including abstinence if that is what someone chooses), healthy body image, and healthy self-image.
Part of combating the misogynistic ideas that paint women as merely sexual orifices is reclaiming the female body and the vagina as OURS and as something we can and should be proud of. I can’t think of anything more empowering than to say “you have the right to say no and be heard, but you also have the right to acknowledge your sexuality and say YES and own it.” Women are repeatedly told that they should be ashamed of their bodies, their sexuality, their vaginas–we can’t even bring ourselves to use the word!! It’s ridiculous! Take Back the Night is anti-violence but also extremely sex positive. Consensual sex is a beautiful thing when people want to be engaging in it. And no one should be ashamed or told that their sexuality is unacceptable or should be hidden and shamed into silence. That is extremely counterproductive to the message of TBtN. Telling women to stop acknowledging their sexuality and their rights to healthy, consensual, mutually respectful relationships is also counterproductive.
The individual who wrote this letter actually did not attend the event. He walked by with a group of friends but refused to stop for even a few moments to show support. That is incredibly frustrating and far more offensive to ME than the display of an anatomically correct vagina (god forbid we all be adults here and recognize that a good 51% of this campus is walking around with a vagina between their legs…with so many phallic symbols all over this campus and guys constantly grabbing their crotch and “readjusting” themselves, we are constantly reminded of penises.)
Lauren–
I am deeply sorry if I offended you by my actions, and I assure you that was not my intent. It is true that I walked by the Thursday night event at Tommy, accompanied by a prospective student and friend from home as we walked back from a previous event we had been at. When we saw the event, we hushed our previously loud conversation out of respect, and I explained to her what the event was and its relation to the shirts in Alumni Park, which we had talked about earlier that day. I chose other plans that night, and it is true that I did not make attending the Thursday night event a priority. i can understand why that would be frustrating in some capacity.
It was certainly not my intent to offend anyone, but I suppose that’s an inevitable side effect of writing any opinion piece. 
I think your final comment, about “readjustment,” helps to illustrate the point I was trying to make. Of course there is nothing inherently wrong with the male or female anatomy, but there is a proper context and place for their discussion and display. As you seem to be mildly perturbed by “readjustment” in public (and understandably so), I am likewise put off by an explicit display next to Tommy. 
That said, i appreciate your comments and your feedback, and I hope that the event went well.

President Barack Obama announced last week that military operations in Libya would be primarily shifted to our NATO allies.
Yet we still pledged to support the mission to depose Colonel Muammar Gaddafi — a pledge that can and will cost billions of dollars if we continue our support.
Not only is this financially detrimental and irresponsible of our government, it will not accomplish anything that will benefit the American people.
According to the Associated Press, Abdel-Hafidh Ghoga, vice chairman of the National Provisional Council, said in a recent interview that “Libyans as a whole, and I am one of them, want a civilian democracy, not dictatorship, not tribalism and not one based on violence or terrorism.”
Obama himself admitted in an address to the nation last Monday the situation in Libya does not threaten the safety of Americans.
“There will be times, though, when our safety is not directly threatened, but our interests and values are,” Obama said.
It seems clear those interests and values are less about democracy and more about our dependence on finite resources.
True, Gaddafi does not necessarily exhibit the American values of democracy and freedom.
But there are countless other examples of nations even worse at espousing such values.
Take, for example, the genocide in the Sudan, Joseph Kony’s kidnapped child soldiers in Uganda. What about Iran or North Korea?
The sad fact is conflict is a part of human nature, and as long as this nature is coupled with corrupt political regimes it will continue to be an irremovable blight on humanity.
Ideally, we would have the resources and manpower to end all humanitarian crises and install democratic governments around the world. But we don’t.
Instead of extending our defense budget to areas where it will not aid in the actual defense of the American people, we need to allocate our resources more wisely.
A good start would be withdrawing support of NATO in Libya, paying our dues to the United Nations and letting actual humanitarian organizations take over.
Increased government spending in Libya does not benefit Americans in any tangible way, despite what Obama said about our “interests.”
For proponents of involvement in Libya, it all comes down to oil.
Rep. Edward Markey (D-Mass.), a ranking member of the House Natural Resources Committee, summed it up best in an interview on MSNBC, saying, “We are in Libya because of the oil. It all goes back to the five million barrels of oil we import from OPEC on a daily basis.”
Libya produces 2 percent of the world’s oil supply, 16th among the world’s top oil producers. And since the conflict, the prices of oil have gone up.
Although oil is undoubtedly important to our economy, the expenditures involved in supporting NATO operations in Libya will likely cost us more money than our lack of Libyan oil would.
We have no sure way of knowing when stability might be restored in Libya.
For all we know, it could extend as long as the war in Vietnam did.
By no means am I antiwar. War is absolutely necessary for the protection of the American people in some cases. But this is not one of those cases.
Obama is handling this crisis relatively well in transitioning power to the NATO coalition and asserting he will not order ground troops to intervene.
But continuing to spend money we don’t have for gain we are unsure of in the first place cannot be a wise move.
Right now, the budget deficit and guarding the safety of American citizens is more important and this pork barrel spending will only serve to increase the deficit.
Despite the president’s statement that our involvement with Libya supports American “interests and values,” it seems to do quite the opposite.

last time we followed a policy like the one you described, we eneded up going into a world war because no one was around to make sure dictators didnt take over govts all over the world. this policy is cowardly and short sited. This a knee jerk reaction to an issue that is much much bigger then Libya itself. I agree we dont need to support NATO or the pitiful UN….but we need to stay on top of what is going on in the world, and keep engaged. If we dont, it wont turn out very good in the end. The results would be terrifying.
Wow!  Talk about someone under the influence of leftist professors.  If you really believe the common, everyday Libyan wants democracy than you really will believe most anything.
*****************
Here are some reasons Islam and democracy are incompatible.
• Inimical to ‘social freedoms’, demanding that all people obey their 7th century moral codes without question or criticism, under penalty of death.
• Inimical to ‘man made’ laws, claiming that their laws are given to them by God/Allah and all must obey them, in submission, under penalty of death.
• Inimical to the ‘social contract’ that is democratic constitutional government, for the people and by the people, in pursuit of ‘life, liberty, and happiness’, as these are ‘man made’ ideas, and to submit to them over Allah’s laws is apostasy, punishable by death.
• Inimical to the ‘rights of individuals’ to pursue their own ideals and beliefs, freedom of worship, freedom of inquiry of truth, freedom of thought, freedom of speech, freedom of artistic expression, freedom of loving other human beings, freedom of choice, freedom of pursuing one’s life with reciprocal respect for others regardless of race, religion, or ethnicity, or sex, as these are our ‘inalienable’ rights; to pursue these may be punishable by death.
• Inimical to ‘democratic freedoms’ as protected by (man made) constitutional laws agreed upon by social contract to protect the rights of individuals, but in favor of ‘dictatorship’ politics supported by the Ulama with the ultimate goal of imposing a universal Caliphate dictating all society according to (Allah/Mohammad’s) Sharia, where submissive obedience is rigorously mandatory, under penalty of death.
• Inimical to intellectual ‘secularism’ in all its forms, in education, in philosophical inquiry and discourse, in the sciences, in religious studies, in history studies, in sociological studies, in anthropological studies, in archeology studies, if these are not in concordance with the ‘religious’ teachings of the Koran, except as studies of ‘infidel’ societies to be subdued, conquered for conversion, to pay the jizyah, or be put to death.
• Inimical to social ‘equality’ of all human beings, especially of the female sex, women kept in oppression as chattel for procreation and sexual gratification of males; as submissively obedient house slaves in violation of the sanctity of their personal humanity, unfree to seek life as they desire but must live in fear of their male masters who will punish them if they disobey, for violating their ‘honor’, with death.

Springfest is what brings us together.
It is that glorious time of year when every non-Californian USC student can pretend he is on The O.C. assuming the show was ever edgy enough to land a performer like T-Pain. The annual attraction is eagerly awaited by students because of the food, comraderie and performances.
Rita Yeung | Daily Trojan
Unless, of course, you are one of the many participants in USC’s Relay for Life, which takes place a hop, skip and organized walk away from Springfest on Cromwell, and which, for the third consecutive year, is scheduled on the same night as Springfest.
The two are admittedly very different affairs. Springfest is a glitzy USC tradition, replete with A-listers, games and food trucks. Relay for Life is a national fundraising function promoted by the American Cancer Society.
Relays take place across the world, and the event has raised more than $3 billion since its inception in 1986. In previous years, USC has raised more than $100,000.
But it’s hard to compete with Mos Def.
Three years ago, when Relay and Springfest were first held concurrently, organizers for both events said they had been unaware of the other’s date.
Last year, an attempt to better schedule the two was foiled by a lack of communication, according to a Daily Trojan article.
Richie Pizano, executive director of Program Board, told the Daily Trojan last year the conflict was regrettable.
“Having both on the same day does hinder both events,” he said. “But at the same time, not everyone is at one event at the same time. If students are already on campus, it’s easy to move back and forth, so it does help.”
Scheduling McCarthy Quad in April is an admittedly formidable task, as it’s a popular venue for both campus and community activities.
What’s more, the Relay for Life committee has to compete with track meets and other philanthropic events get a weekend on the track.
Nonetheless, three years in a row is too many to blame the conflict on lack of communication or options.
Pizano was right; the conflict does hinder both events, though it’s reasonable to posit Relay for Life takes a bigger hit.
The fundraiser can’t boast the carnival atmosphere or celebrity appearances.
This year’s Relay will reportedly feature writer and USC alum Zack Jerome of the regionally popular Lost Angeles blog. Jerome’s a talented blogger, but he can’t compete with the Program Board’s top-billed act.
And Relay for Life’s purpose isn’t to pull in famous acts, anyway. Rather, it’s a community effort, a genuine example of Trojans and Angelenos coming together for a good cause.
Relay is an uplifting reminder of the reason why USC is a leader in community service and philanthropy.
The event shouldn’t have to prove its popularity over Rooney.
It’s time for both scheduling committees to get their acts together. Three years is enough to prove each event draws enough students to justify holding the events on separate nights.
If all other reasons to resolve the date conflict fall on deaf ears, there is one last case to make.
At every Relay for Life event, as darkness falls and participants begin to set up campgrounds on the track, candles are lit one-by-one and placed in paper bags, each bearing the name of someone who has fought cancer. Surrounding the field, these lights are called luminaria.
As the sepia glow illuminates the track, relayers walk in silence, commemorating those who have survived and those who haven’t. The mood isn’t somber, but reverent. For one hour, only syncopated footfalls are heard.
That, and the thousands of students screaming across campus as Mos Def does his sound check.

Coming off of a perfect 4-0 record last weekend, junior Alison Ramos was named Pac-10 Player of the Week Wednesday.
Ramos joins the likes of senior Maria Sanchez as just the second USC player to be honored with this award.
After struggling against Cal and Stanford, Ramos rebounded to sweep both her singles matches against Oregon and Washington State.
Ramos dominated Pascale Neubert (6-0, 6-0) in Eugene, and then took down Washington State’s Andjela Kankaras (6-2, 6-1) on Saturday.
She and senior Cristala Andrews also were a perfect 2-0 on the doubles circuit during the weekend.

USC University Hospital’s kidney transplant program resumed operations Monday, two months after doctors transplanted the wrong kidney into a patient who survived the error.
Hospital officials voluntarily suspended the transplant program Jan. 29 to investigate the incident and to improve the hospital’s safety standards.
A mismatched kidney could prove fatal, but the patient involved survived the transplant, which occurred Jan. 29.
Human and processing errors were to blame for the transplant mix-up, according to Dr. Cynthia Herrington, USC Hospital’s transplant director.
“It was our process of matching the donor identification number to the recipient’s name that failed,” Herrington said in a statement Tuesday.
The United Network for Organ Sharing’s Department of Evaluation and Quality, a federal oversight agency, reviewed the hospital’s safety and transplant policies in early February.
If a problem was found with the hospital’s procedures, UNOS would have released a report, but no report has come out.
The California Department of Public Health, the licensing agency for hospitals in California and the agency responsible for investigating complaints against hospitals in the state, also conducted an investigation into the hospital’s kidney transplant procedures.
USC University Hospital’s kidney transplant program, which opened in 1991, has performed more than 250 transplants. The program has an average 92-percent patient survival rate and 87-percent graft survival rate at three years post-transplant.

Learning how to manage personal finances might not be on the minds of most high school students, but a group of USC students has started a volunteer organization on campus to teach local high schoolers how to do just that.

Moneythink is a national organization that sends college mentors into local high school classrooms to teach programs geared toward helping students make smart decisions about their money. The USC chapter was started by a student to help inner-city Los Angeles students, and currently has 10 volunteer mentors teaching in five classrooms.
Chirag Sagar, a junior majoring in business administration and founder of the Moneythink chapter at USC, said the organization empowers urban youth with instruction in “entrepreneurship, financial literacy and financial life skills” in an attempt to teach them skills necessary to effectively manage personal finances. Lessons include how to open a bank account and conduct basic investing strategies to help students who might not learn these skills otherwise.
Teams of two mentors visit a class period once a week for around seven weeks to teach a program focused on either finance or entrepreneurship. Sagar said the high school students respond well to the lessons because they relate better to a college mentor than an adult teacher.
“We provide a network, resources and an opportunity to inner-city kids to become successful,” Sagar said. “We’re trying to help those kids out, motivate them and show them a way to become successful outside of just school itself.”
The Moneythink curriculum focuses on financial skills because most high schools provide little education in that area. Sagar said students can often graduate with little knowledge of how to manage their own finances.
“What we found is only about 35 percent of students are taught financial literacy,” Sagar said. “There’s no financial literacy curriculum in high schools, apart from in about seven to 10 states total. What it comes down to is, 16 – 18-year-olds need to know how to manage their money.”
The organization’s focus on serving more underprivileged schools reflects a larger trend in USC service groups that is evident in programs like the Good Neighbors Campaign and Neighborhood Academic Initiative.
“I’m interested in education, especially with lower-income and inner-city students,” said Jem Jebbia, a junior majoring in business entrepreneurship and Moneythink mentor. “It’s really a perfect way to tie together entrepreneurship and learning.”
Moneythink was initially developed by students at the University of Chicago in September 2008 and has since expanded to 22 universities nationwide, with plans to spread to China and India.
The chapter at USC was officially started in the fall, and more mentors were added this semester, but Sagar had already begun to lay the foundations for the organization when he first got involved in April 2009.
Sagar’s friend Ted Gonder helped to found the program at the University of Chicago and, when Sagar heard about the program, he became interested.
“Then a teacher at Roosevelt High in L.A. found out about his program, called the Financial Education Initiative at the time, and said she wanted it to be in L.A.,” Sagar said. “Ted contacted me and asked if I could do this, so I taught a two-day session. Once I saw the impact that we had, I was committed to creating a chapter at USC.”
Despite the organization’s fledgling status at USC, Sagar sees great potential for the program’s development.
He hopes to double the number of mentors teaching the program from 10 to upward of 20 for next year and to get advisers and professional entrepreneurs involved with the program as well. Ultimately, he wants the chapter to be a self-sustaining organization that can continue after he graduates.
Those involved in Moneythink believe the program will remain successful because of the rewards it provides to the mentors who teach the classes as well as to the students themselves.
“It’s really inspiring to see students respond even just a little bit to what you’re teaching them,” Jebbia said. “The content that we’re teaching is important, but the bigger picture is that we’re there representing college students and USC in general, and they can see that we’ve been successful in pursuing higher education. It’s an open door for them that shows they might be able to do it, too.”
[…] will explain my involvement in the program at a later date, but feel free to read the article and learn what we are doing at the moment, and will be doing in the […]

A student has come forward with information about the viral Kappa Sigma email that circulated around the university campus and beyond, according to Vice President of Student Affairs Michael L. Jackson.
Jackson said the university is currently reviewing the information the student provided to see if it changes the university’s view of what happened.
Jackson sent an email to the university community last month, saying the university had learned in its investigation that a USC student did not write the email. Instead, the university said, a friend at an East Coast university forwarded it to the student who sent it to the USC Kappa Sigma listserv.
Mitchell Wilson, executive director of Kappa Sigma Fraternity, said the Kappa Sigma Fraternity nationals has completed its investigation of the viral email. Wilson said the investigation was not able to determine who created the email, but the individuals at USC involved with forwarding the email and making inappropriate comments in response to the email are in the process of being disciplined. Wilson did not talk about the punishments.
Wilson also said Kappa Sigma nationals will soon be conducting a membership review of USC’s Kappa Sigma chapter.
“We go in and meet with each individual and we review them, we look at their record of membership in the chapter and what they’ve done,” Wilson said. “We have to have some affirmation that they are committed to the values of our fraternity and that they are going to live by these values.”
Wilson said membership reviews for Kappa Sigma chapters occur on a case-by-case basis. Individuals who are found in violation of Kappa Sigma’s principles will be suspended or expelled from the fraternity.
“We wish to make very sure that we have the men going forward who are going to represent our fraternity in a positive fashion,” Wilson said.
She will be never seen again…The cover-up continues
I feel like none of my comments on this site are ever posted anymore.
Anyway, I’m glad the investigation is continuing. Today in my French class, we were talking about the email and 6 different people all said they knew it was a coverup and they knew who the author was. I felt bad for the couple of kids who didn’t know!
The e-mail has hurt plenty of women on campus and it’s a call to action. Enough of the “it’s no big deal” comments. And, most importantly, what happened to all of the comments that were already posted on this story?
It’s no big deal.
Seriously? this is an entirely new article. It was posted yesterday. It was in the paper today. The original email story had all the comments. Losers.
for the love of gawd…WHO CARES! the email hurts no one, and is a non issue. It will neither form a young mans opinion of ladies, or get any ladie attacked. Its a tasteless stupid joke that no oen will act on. Stop acting like this is the biggest danger to women since Bundy. GEEZ!!!

College students, especially those living close to a large number of students, are at a significantly higher risk for contracting meningitis than the rest of the population.
Charity · Otana Jakpor, a freshman majoring in global health, attended an event during Global Health Awareness Week to raise money for Japan. - Kelvin Kuo | Daily Trojan 
According to a recent warning issued by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, meningitis has a case rate of 1 in 100,000 in a non-student population. College freshmen living in dormitories, however, contract meningitis at an a increased rate of 4.6 cases per 100,000 people.
“In the U.S. this infection is rare, fortunately, but when we see it, it’s usually found in populations where there is crowded living: military barracks and college dormitories,” said Dr. Alejandro Sanchez, assistant professor of clinical medicine at the Keck School of Medicine.
The CDC reports approximately 2,500 to 3,500 cases of meningococcal meningitis annually. Meningitis is a bacterial infection of fluid surrounding the brain and spinal cord.
“If left untreated, the disease is deadly,” said Dr. William Leavitt, USC’s lead physician at the University Park Health Center. “If treatment is delayed there can be serious neurological consequences.”
USC’s Global Health Student Club began hosting a series of events Monday for the third annual Global Health Awareness Week to raise awareness about health issues including infectious diseases, pollution, vaccination and environmental health.
Global Health Awareness events include film screenings at the Ray Stark Family Theater, a Health Sciences Opportunity Fair in the von KleinSmid Center Courtyard and a Lunchtime Speakers Series on the Health Sciences Campus.
Meningitis not only affects domestic populations, but is more commonly seen in an area of sub-Saharan Africa called the meningitis belt. Therefore, learning how to prevent or minimize the outbreak in the United States by educating community members during Global Health Awareness Week are the first steps to solving a more globally complex problem, Flores said.
Education about the consequences of meningitis is a focal point in promoting awareness about the disease. One in 10 individuals who contract meningitis dies from the infection, while others are affected for life. Neurological damage, deafness and loss of arm and leg movement are serious results of delayed treatment, according to Leavitt.
The easiest way to prevent meningitis is by receiving a vaccination for the disease, which the UPHC offers.
“I’ve received the vaccination, but if I hadn’t and learned more about the disease, I would be more inclined to get it to protect myself,” said Kelly Kinsella, a freshman majoring in public relations.
The meningococcal meningitis vaccination is “strongly recommended” to all incoming freshman before or promptly after moving onto campus. The vaccine is not mandatory, however, because it is expensive and the disease is rare, according to Leavitt.
“Some students got the vaccine at home before coming to USC,” Leavitt said. “The rest are not concerned enough to come in [to the health center] and get it.”
According to Leavitt, meningitis is “very rare” at USC, but the risks still remain in crowded living arrangements with students living in dorms.
“I’ve been vaccinated prior to coming to USC mainly because I’m aware of how deadly meningitis can be,” said Jackie Drobny, an undeclared freshman.
Some students said vaccination did make a difference.
Vaccination prevents four types of meningitis and is 90 percent effective in all recipients, according to Leavitt.
To keep a potential outbreak low, Leavitt suggests students make their way to the health center to get vaccinated, especially undergraduates living in on-campus dormitories.
Engaging in activities where students come into direct contact with one another are likely to promote the disease, according to the health center.
“The disease is easily spread by droplet transmission, and college students engage in activities that promote the spread of this infection by sharing cigarettes, drinking glasses, utensils [and] food, as well as kissing,” Leavitt said. “Fortunately, this usually results in passing a carrier state [when an organism is present in the body but does not cause symptoms] between individuals.”
Absolutely, I lived in near complete isolation for YEARS and I never contracted meningitis.
