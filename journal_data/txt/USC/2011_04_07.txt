A two-match sweep of Oregon and Washington State last weekend should give the USC women’s tennis team the momentum it needs to power through the final leg of its road trip, as it takes on Arizona State.
USC (13-5, 2-3) looks to avenge its early-season loss to the No. 15 Sun Devils (13-5, 3-2), who beat the Women of Troy on March 16.
The Wildcats could not field a full roster, which resulted in a victory for the Women of Troy (13-5, 2-3).
Led by No. 11 Jacqueline Cako, ASU boasts four ranked singles players and two ranked doubles teams this season.
Senior Maria Sanchez will likely face off against No. 19 Kelcy McKenna, who she beat decisively 6-0, 6-3 in their first matchup.
Sophomore Danielle Lao will look to keep her two-match winning streak going, as she seeks revenge against Cako after falling 6-3, 6-3 when the two met earlier in the season.
The two stars of the road trip, freshman Kaitlyn Christian and junior Alison Ramos, will have their hands full as they square off against No. 106 Micaela Hein and No. 120 Hannah James, respectively.
Ramos earned Pac-10 Player of the Week honors this week for her accomplishments against Oregon and Washington State last weekend, as she went a perfect 4-0 in doubles and singles en route to back-to-back USC victories.
It remains to be seen whether sophomore Valeria Pulido will be healthy enough to participate in today’s match, as she suffered against Stanford.
The team is looking to build on its two most recent victories.
“ASU will be a challenge, but it will be a great opportunity to beat a very tough team on the road,” USC coach Richard Gallien said. “Their team is disciplined and we will need to play well to beat them.”
The Women of Troy were supposed to play two matches this weekend, but Arizona was forced to forfeit Saturday’s match because its student-athletes reached a maximum participation limit for the season. Student-athletes playing tennis are only allowed to participate in 25 matches, including tournaments.
With a rematch against UCLA looming when the Women of Troy return home, a win in Tempe would be a huge boost to USC’s ego.
First serve is at 12:30 p.m.

No one would blame the USC men’s volleyball team if, with the Mountain Pacific Sports Federation regular season title wrapped up, it approached this upcoming road trip to Honolulu as a vacation.
Stepping up · Senior opposite Murphy Troy and USC will try to slow down Hawaii’s Jonas Umlauft, a candidate for National Player of the Year. - Carlo Acenas | Daily Trojan 
But this team holds itself to a higher standard, as No. 1 USC (18-1, 17-1), is off to its best start since 1991.
“There’s no change in how we’re going to do this,” said USC coach Bill Ferguson. “We’re not emptying the bench or anything like that. We’re going to use this as an opportunity to get better because we’re still a little ways off from where we want to be.”
No. 8 Hawai’i (14-11, 12-8) has two indisputable star players in All-Americans Jonas Umlauft and Joshua Walker.
Umlauft has emerged as the frontrunner for the National Player of the Year award, improving his average kills per set to an NCAA leading 5.59 after a weekend in which he registered 49 kills in seven sets against Cal State Northridge.
Upon comparing that figure to celebrated senior opposite Murphy Troy’s 4.14 kills per set, it is clear why Umlauft will be the focus of the coaching staff’s attention during pre-match meetings.
Walker, for his part, has been a worthy sidekick, averaging 3.58 kills per set, along with a respectable .338 hitting percentage.
“They’re a unique combination,” Ferguson said. “They’re both very different. Umlauft [6-foot-9] is much taller than Walker [6-foot-2]. Both of those guys can hit Hawai’i out of almost any situation. They’re used to hitting against two- and three-person blocks all the time.”
To limit these two stars, the Trojans will look to their two stalwart middle blockers: senior Austin Zahn and junior Steven Shandrick. If USC’s middle defense can remain disciplined and make the appropriate reads, Hawai’i will be hard-pressed to score consistently.
“The middles really have to be patient and technically sound,” Ferguson said. “We’re not going to be able to cheat or to hedge against one side of the court or another. They’re going to have to set the tone for us. If our middles take their middles out, we can be in for a good night.”
USC plays a weekend set against the Warriors Friday and Saturday.
Both matches begin at 7 p.m.

Two years ago, former USC coach Chad Kreuter signed a recruiting class with several high-profile prospects during the early signing period in November. In contrast, Stanford, which comes to Dedeaux Field for a weekend series beginning tonight at 6 p.m., had a class that didn’t feature as many top-tier prospects.
Turnaround · USC’s pitching staff has struggled lately, but junior pitcher Andrew Triggs will be asked to give the team a solid outing on the mound. - Mannat Saini | Daily Trojan 
Infielders Jiovanni Mier, Matt Davidson and Jeffrey Malm, along with pitcher Brooks Pounders, rated top-50 prospects by MaxPreps.com, each signed a National Letter of Intent to play for USC (11-18, 2-4) in 2009.
None, however, ever donned a Trojans jersey. Mier, Davidson and Pounders were selected by pick No. 53 in the 2009 MLB draft and Malm was taken with the 159th selection.
Instead of a nine-player recruiting class that would have been rated in the top 10, USC only signed four players who are still with the program. Of those four, only sophomore infielder Adam Landecker and senior pitcher Logan Odom are consistent starters.
Stanford (14-7, 2-1), on the other hand, brought in 11 players. Two years later, six of the signees from that class are significant contributors for the No. 11 team in the nation, headed by Kenny Diekroeger and Mark Appel.
Diekroeger was the Pac-10 Freshman of the Year last season, after leading the Cardinal with a .356 average and tying for the team lead with 41 RBIs. Appel is Stanford’s Friday night starter as a sophomore.
That signing class shows the discrepancy between USC and Stanford.
Though the Trojans feature a number of players who might one day play professionally, they do not have the depth like the rest of the Pac-10 conference. Six Pac-10 teams are ranked in the Baseball America Top 25, the most of any conference.
“We might not be a top-10 team, but there’s no reason we can’t play like a top-20 team,” said USC interim coach Frank Cruz. “But we have to darn near play perfect — play with more enthusiasm, play with more energy than the other team.”
For Cruz, that starts with the starting pitching. Last weekend against No. 13 California, no Trojans starting pitcher made it through five innings.
“These guys are realizing we can play with any team in the country, but we have to pitch,” Cruz said. “If our pitchers go seven innings, we can be in any game.
Junior Andrew Triggs (2-2, 5.31 ERA) will face off against Appel on Friday, followed by junior Austin Wood on Saturday and Odom on Sunday.
Wood made some slight changes in his delivery when he pitched an inning against Loyola Marymount. Cruz is hoping Wood gained confidence from the relief appearance, after he failed to make it out of the first inning of his start against California.
Though the Trojans’ pitching has struggled recently, the bats have started to heat up.
The insertion of sophomore walk-on outfielder J.R. Aguirre has brought a new energy to a lineup that had become stagnant with too many strikeouts.
Cutting down strikeouts are something the coaching staff has been emphasizing and will be a key against Stanford.
“They got power arms, but they don’t have a lot of strikeouts,” said junior outfielder Alex Sherrod. “Because they don’t have a lot of strikeouts, we’re really gonna try to focus on putting the ball in play this weekend.”
Sherrod might finally be back from the ankle injury that sidelined him for the last nine games, according to Cruz, and he is hopeful the junior will at least be able to provide another power bat in the middle of the lineup this weekend, even if he is unable to play the field.
Before he got injured, Sherrod was batting .319 with 16 RBIs, and led the team with four home runs.
Junior first baseman Ricky Oropesa has since taken over the home run lead. His five homers, 22 runs, 29 RBIs and .363 average all lead the team.
“I’m seeing the ball pretty well,” Oropesa said. “Recognizing the pitch to hit and letting the pitcher throw strikes. I’m not trying to do too much with pitches.”
Junior outfielder Garret Houts has also come on strong. He has raised his batting average to .351 after hitting .538 in the last week.
“[Houts] has really been swinging the bat well lately,” Cruz said. “He’s given us another bat in the outfield.”
Stanford is led by Diekroeger’s .414 average and his middle of the infield partner, Lonnie Kauppila. The freshman second baseman is batting .348 after a 15-for-20 week that earned him National Player of the Week honors.
“They’ve got some good players. But we’re ready for them. No surprises,” junior reliever Chad Smith said. “We know all the Pac-10 teams are good and every weekend is a battle. We’re ready to go.”

As dominant as the USC men’s tennis team has been lately, its all-time 92-2 record against Arizona is even more impressive.
Daily Trojan
The Trojans (18-2, 4-0) will look to build on their 11-match winning streak and continue their dominance over Arizona in Saturday’s Pac-10 match.
Coming off dominant back-to-back 7-0 victories against Oregon and Washington, No. 2 USC welcomes No. 55 Arizona to Marks Stadium. The Wildcats (8-11, 0-4) are coming off losses to California and Stanford.
The last time Arizona beat USC was in 2006, when it defended home court with a narrow 4-3 victory.
With only three more matches scheduled before the Pac-10 championships and NCAA tournament, the Trojans understand they need the right mindset going into today’s match.
“We’ve got to have the right attitude, not overlooking [Arizona] or thinking it’s going to be easy,” said senior captain Jaak Poldma.
Although it might be easy to look past Arizona and its record, the Wildcats boast an experienced squad that features seniors Andres Carrasco, Geoff Embry, Jay Goldman and Borja Malo.
The Trojans, however, counter with Poldma and juniors Steve Johnson and Daniel Nguyen. Along with these upperclassmen, USC’s freshmen have played pivotal roles in the team’s success this season.
“It’s been a good year so far,” Poldma said. “A lot of guys, freshmen, have stepped up and matured and taken over roles.”
With an undeniable bevy of talent in Johnson, Poldma and freshman Ray Sarmiento, who has won all of his singles matches when he was not injured, USC looks primed to make another late postseason run.
“Everything that is most important is still in the way,” Poldma said. “It doesn’t really matter how you play in the season until the NCAAs.”
First serve is at 12 p.m. Saturday.

The other day, my buddy and I got into a pretty intense argument. It started out with him saying he was glad spring football had started, because “now there’s something worth talking about in USC athletics.”
I shot back that, although it was okay for him to be excited about spring ball, he had no right to crown football the best USC sport.
So then I got to thinking. What is the best sport at USC?
A lot of people, myself included, would argue that for a while in the mid-2000s, football was far and away the best sport.
The team won 34 straight games at one point, which is sixth all-time in Division I. If it wasn’t for a certain Texas quarterback, USC would also have won three straight national titles.
It was the country’s most dominant program in the country’s most popular collegiate sport.
But the times have changed quicker than the Chicago Bears’ quarterbacks.
During the last two years, the football program, amid NCAA sanctions and other circumstances, has fallen back to the pack. Although still a top-tier program, it is no longer top dog at USC.
With football out of the picture, I began to consider other sports. The women’s soccer team won the NCAA title in 2007 and had a future U.S. national team player in Amy Rodriguez. Inconsistent play, however, has marred the Women of Troy as of late. They’ve made it to the NCAA tournament the last three years, but haven’t advanced past the third round.
Not much good can be said about the baseball team, which has been stuck in a perpetual state of mediocrity, despite once being a prominent program.
The USC men’s tennis team, meanwhile, is like a blackjack dealer in Vegas. There are times when they would be showing a six, turn over a king and deal a five while the rest of the table had 20. This could go on for years if you were sitting at the table. Then there are times when they are just giving away money.
Thankfully for the house, the tennis team is on a crazy streak.
After winning the 2009 NCAA championship as a No. 8 seed, the Trojans came back last year to beat No. 1 Virginia for the second consecutive year before knocking No. 2 Tennessee out of the finals.
Currently ranked No. 2 in the country, there is nothing to suggest these kings of the court won’t continue to defy the odds and get the three-peat.
But I’m not ready to crown the tennis team yet.
The men’s water polo team has already won three NCAA championships in a row, thanks to Tommy Award-winning Coach of the Year Jovan Vavic. Despite high turnover of graduating seniors, the team stuck together and overcame the adversity of having such a young team to stay at the top of the Mountain Pacific Sports Federation standings.
Even with the football team’s streak seven years ago and the current tennis team’s run, I would argue no program has more resembled a dynasty than the men’s water polo program.
But what about the reigning NCAA champion women’s water polo team, or the 2008 NCAA champion women’s golf team that finished tantalizingly short of a repeat in 2009? Or the women’s tennis team, which currently boasts the No. 1 player in the country, Maria Sanchez?
Lastly, there’s arguably the hottest team at the school right now: the men’s volleyball team.
These giants of the Galen Center have only lost one match all year, and with most players returning from a squad that lost to UC Irvine in the NCAA championships two years ago, there doesn’t seem to be anything that can stop these hungry men.
All of these teams are worthy of consideration and have valid arguments as the best sport.
The point here is that, like the iPhone commercial, if you don’t play sports at USC, well, you don’t play sports at USC.
But who is the best team at this school? I’ll leave that up for you to decide.

On a day that ended with a failed halfback pass, junior quarterback Matt Barkley and the rest of USC’s first-team offense were left searching for the explosiveness that was a trademark of last year’s group.
Leadership · Junior quarterback Matt Barkley has been a positive influence for his wide receivers and offensive line in spring practice. - Chris Pham | Daily Trojan 
“I’m not worried about [throwing interceptions] at all,” Barkley said. “There’s a lot that goes into any given play between me and the receiver. I have goals that I set for myself and things that I want to accomplish this year and I’m excited.”
Shoddy route running and poor pass protection were two of the more noticeable problems for a Trojans offense that saw Barkley throw away as many balls as he completed.
Aside from junior Robbie Boyer, who was a frequent target all morning, the rest of the receivers looked lost in the offense and compounded the problem by proving to be less-than-stellar catching the ball.
Although sophomore Robert Woods did show flashes of talent befitting of the Pac-10 Offensive Freshman of the Year, even he struggled with consistency and lacked the playmaking ability that helped him become the first true freshman to start at wide receiver for USC since World War II.
The maligned offensive line was thoroughly manhandled for much of the day by an equally criticized defensive line.
On the offensive front, coach Kennedy Pola’s group is trying to find replacements for three starters along the line, including possible top-15 pick Tyron Smith. The group is a work in progress for now, and hopefully the offensive leadership will be enough to ease the transition for the young lineman.
“I’m just trying to get their spirits up since the [young guys] get down on themselves sometimes,” Barkley said. “Try to keep it positive, keep it up beat and just keep getting back to the line [and start over].”

At the running back position, redshirt freshman D.J. Morgan showed the type of explosion to turn the corner, which along with his soft hands, made him a constant threat on swing passes throughout seven-on-seven drills.

One week after a heartbreaking 9-8 home loss to No. 1 Stanford in double overtime, the No. 3 USC women’s water polo team (15-4, 3-2) journeys across town to Westwood, Calif. for a grudge match against UCLA.
Offensive force · Senior two-meter Kristen Dronberger joined the century club at USC, notching her 100th career goal. She leads the Women of Troy with 30 goals this season, and will be heavily relied on to help USC defeat its crosstown rivals Saturday. - Daily Trojan file photo 
In addition to rivalry implications, Saturday’s contest is expected to have a huge hand in determining the rankings for the upcoming Mountain Pacific Sports Federation tournament, with just one conference game against San Jose State left on the slate.
“It should decide the seedings for the [MPSF] tournament, and it gives quite significant implications as to how well we can play in our league,” said USC coach Jovan Vavic. “It is a very important game for both teams, so we really have to focus and prepare.”
After their tough loss to Stanford, the Women of Troy have used a grueling week of practices to jumpstart their preparation for UCLA (19-5, 2-3), leaving little time to dwell on last week’s loss.
“We’ve had three really good practices this week so far, and we’re focusing on UCLA,” Vavic said. “We didn’t spend much time talking about Stanford — we had one talk after the game, but ever since then we’ve just been looking at this UCLA game. I’m pretty pleased with the team so far.”
Upending the No. 4 Buins won’t be an easy process, as they hold a 38-18 all-time mark against the Women of Troy. This season, they have won four of their last six games.
Against Stanford last week, junior driver Nadia Dan, senior two-meter Kristen Dronberger and freshman goalie Flora Bolonyai stepped up for the Women of Troy. While all three will be counted upon Saturday, Vavic also believes that to be successful, the whole team needs to play at a higher level.
“Every game is different as to who needs to step up and play well, but Dronberger had a good game, and Dan had a good game,” Vavic said. “Our goalie played well, too. However, we need more people to step up. If we had a couple more girls step up against Stanford, we could have beaten them.”
This week, the team will focus on defense. Defensive errors have cost the team games, and the team knows it is defense that wins matches.
“Against Stanford, we made some defensive errors and that really cost us,” Vavic said. “Last time we played UCLA, we were up with an early lead, then in the fourth quarter we didn’t play good defense. UCLA is a fast team, and they have some good counterattack players and some good two-meter players. We have to play good defense, and we’re also going to have to be able to convert our opportunities.”

These days, with a new revolution seemingly every week, it can be hard to keep track of  current events. Although Tunisia, Egypt, Libya, Yemen, Bahrain and Syria have dominated the headlines, you might have missed what has possibly been the deadliest conflict of all —  the one in the Ivory Coast.
Julia Vann | Daily Trojan
The situation in the Ivory Coast presents a powerful argument for those who oppose international intervention solely for humanitarian purposes.
The United States chose not to get involved, and the conflict has subsided without U.S. intervention.
The dispute in the Ivory Coast started in November, when a long-delayed election was finally held. The winner was opposition leader Alassane Ouattara, and the United Nations, African Union and every Western country recognized him as the legitimate president. Incumbent Laurent Gbagbo refused to give up the presidency. Instead, he took the oath of office and kept his government in place.
Nobody in the international community knew quite what to do. No country was willing to intervene militarily to depose Gbagbo, but without that threat there was little that could be done.
Economic sanctions seemed to punish Ivorians without affecting Gbagbo, who refused to negotiate with international envoys. There were even 11,000 U.N. peacekeepers in the country, but they were powerless to change the status quo.
Not surprisingly, this sticky situation led to violent conflict, and eventually war broke out. Ouatarra’s forces marched last week on the commercial capital, Abidjan, and have now conquered most of the city — except for the compound where Gbagbo is holed up. Gbagbo mounted a fierce resistance, which motivated U.N. and French forces to intervene on Ouatarra’s behalf. Officials hope that Gbagbo can be persuaded to give up in the near future and that most of the fighting is over, but estimates are that more than 1,500 have died and hundreds of thousands have been displaced.
From a U.S. perspective, though, war in the Ivory Coast was never a major priority.
Paying attention to conflicts in sub-Saharan Africa has never been an American specialty, and between the revolts sweeping the Arab world and, more recently, the earthquake-tsunami-nuclear meltdown über-disaster in Japan, there has been little room on the front page for yet another case of African civil war.
Without any public interest, there has been very little official interest, either. Although protests in Egypt made the front page and demanded an immediate and decisive response from the U.S. government, the lack of coverage of the Ivory Coast meant the government could get away with dedicating only nominal resources to helping resolve the crisis.
Now that it seems the conflict in the Ivory Coast is winding down, though, the American people can take away more from the conflict than what we actually put into it.
The limited scope of Americans’ attention to the conflict was not a bad thing —  there are too many problems in the world for everyone to be educated about all of them. Without public support, however, there is little incentive for the government to get involved.
In fact, even when we do decide to intervene somewhere, there is no guarantee we will have the tools necessary to succeed. In this case, France and the U.N. have been involved in the Ivory Coast situation all along, but simply lacked the credibility and leverage to force Gbagbo out.
The United States remains the strongest country in the world, with the most sophisticated military and largest economy, but that does not mean we can influence everything the way we would like to.
This case is a example of one the hallmarks of President Obama’s foreign policy — insisting our allies and other powers share responsibility for the world’s problems. In his speech on the Libyan intervention, Obama said, “The burden of action should not be America’s alone …[allies and partners should] bear their share of the burden and pay their share of the costs.”
In the end, it seems the Ivorian conflict played out exactly as it would have had we become involved in the beginning; our role was simply replaced by France. From a U.S. perspective, this is a much better outcome — saving American money, credibility and possibly lives.
All of these add up to produce an argument in favor of realism in deciding how to allocate American resources.
Next time the President suggests an intervention based on idealism or moralism, it might be wise to remember the lessons of the Ivory Coast.
 
Daniel Charnoff is a senior majoring in international relations (global business). His column, “Through the Static,” runs Fridays.
I agree with the previous comments. This is just the Beginning. What is happening in Ivory Coast is not about Gbagbo and Ouattara as it is  constantly reported in the press. The fight in Ivory Coast is  a fight about Africa’s real independence  from colonial powers, which are known in modern terms as the international  community (France, the UK, the U.S., and the UN secretary general).   A pro-Gbagbo defeat in Ivory Coast will set the fight for  real independence in Africa back many years. 
The International community is using a strange election that took place  in Ivory Coast last November to put Mr. Ouattara, who is now known in many places  in Africa as the exported president, in power. The election took place in  two rounds. Even Ouattara’s people accepted that Gabgbo  won the first round by some margin. In the second round, the Ivory Coast’s constitutional  body in charge of the election results declared Gabgbo the winner,  but a UN-backed commissioner declared Ouattara the winner from the Ouattara-election headquarters.  I do not know a single president in  the so-called French-speaking Africa who has won any elections of any sort  in which the opposition recognizes him or her as the winner. The famous international  community was asleep as usual in July 2009 in Congo and  in August 2009 in Gabon.   The international community suddenly  woke up in November 2010 after the Ivory Coast election. Yes,  the Gulf of Guinea, along with the deep water  of the Gulf of Mexico and the coasts off Brazil, has few oil resources still to tap for production. The upper part of the Gulf of Guinea  and the deepwater of the lower part of the Gulf of Guinea are the modern prizes. What will the fight for scare oil resources look like?
Gbagbo has spent all his adult life in opposition to modern colonial rule,  whereas Ouattara was a member of this ruling class.  Lots of Africans have high hopes about President Obama, and I guess it cannot be worse.  What happened to the slogan “Africa’s future is up to Africans”?
Ouattara has never been a militant  for democracy in any form that I can find. Surprise, surprise. He spent his time either in the non-democratic pre-Gbagbo government or in the IMF, another source of African decline. Now the international community  has found a committed democrat, in the form of Mr. Ouattara, whom Africa can do  without and for whom is worth killing score of Africans.
Having been in Ivory Coast during the start of the civil war in September 2002, the same one that brought out many of the North-South tensions that are at work there today, I can tell you that French military involvement in their former colony is nothing new and has very little to do with Obama’s policy of getting other NATO members to do their part.
This was post-911, pre-Iraq, with Bush as president, and the civil war trapped about 200 foreigners, mostly Americans, at a school just outside Bouake where the fighting started.  As a Canadian living at the school, I recall looking forward to the American Marines finally showing up to get us out of there.
They didn’t.
Actually, a small contingent of them made it as far north as Yamoussoukro, but they didn’t dare enter Bouake.  
Instead, it was the French Foreign Legionnaires who brought us out of Bouake and to Yamo, dropping us in American hands who then took us to Abidjan.  
The French never actually left Cote D’Ivoire during the past 8 years, partly because of the large number of their own that were in the country.  And they have intervened numerous times, but mostly to protect their own interests, at one point even attacking Gbagbo’s air force after an attempted strike on French assets.   They have also protected Ouattara during this whole mess, but have been leary of directly attacking Gbagbo, perhaps because they are already seen as interfering too much in their former colony.  
And no, it’s not over yet.  Gbagbo still clings to power.  Abidjan is still a mess.  The international community, including France, is still mainly protecting their own interests.  But if anyone does decide to finish him off, it will be the French, not because Obama did or said anything, but because they take care of their own problems.
First off, the Ivory Coast conflict is not “dying down.” It’s escalating.  You just can’t read about it because journalists are trapped under their beds in hotels for fear of militias coming to kill foreigners. An untold number of people are being killed by death squads going door to door in Abidjan and Western Ivory Coast has devolved into a massacre.  It will continue to be a massacre for months, even after Gbagbo leaves his bunker.  I wouldn’t be surprised if Western Ivory Coast — which has been effectively a conflict zone since the first Liberian civil war — continues to be a hotspot of violence for another decade. 
Meanwhile, it may be months before we know what actually happened in Ivory Coast and how many people were actually killed.
One of the problems with the world wide web is this kind of wikipedia journalism.  I respect this piece, the author got most of the story right — but his point is wildly wrong.
Ivory Coast boiled over precisely because the international community — including other African states — *didn’t* get involved.  It’s not like, “Oh, America ignored this conflict, and wow, it went away.  Maybe we should ignore more conflicts.”  That little syllogism is a mess to unthread.
If American had cramped down earlier on Gbagbo, had taken out the heavy weapons his militias used to kill hundreds in Abidjan and untold hundreds — maybe thousands — more elsewhere, there may have been peace by now.
If America had deployed more election observers to Ivory Coast in both rounds, and supported the Carter Center more, there would have been a more clear verdict on the vote. 
What if America had set up relief corridors for refugees? Or played a more active role at the UN to nudge Russia into OKing an Ecowas military intervention? 
I’m not necessarily saying America should have intervened in Ivory Coast, although Obama could have definitely spent a few more of his precious minutes talking about it, if only to dignify the loss of life in the country.  But saying “America ignored Ivory Coast and now it has subsided” is a bit like saying “Oh, American ignored Rwanda and now it is one of Africa’s fastest growing economies.”
i wonder why most of us are stupid and idiot even when we have a master degree. if i was not , 2 years ago in ivory Coast i would believe that story… i guest most of the western media tell the story the same way, the way wesrtern corporation want us, outsiders, to know it……. Now a day, UN and NATO are used to protect big corporation interest under the pretext they want to say lives. CACAO IN IVORY COAST, OIL IN LIBYA there are always idiots ready to play their games such as those tribes in Cote D’Ivoire and Bengazy Libya. VIVE COCA AND OIL

In an effort to better evaluate its teachers, the Los Angeles Unified School District this spring will implement their own “value-added” system, which involves a doctorate-level string of mathematical symbols and letters more than 80 characters long.
This “value-added” system looks at each student’s past test scores to predict future scores, then generates a teacher’s effectiveness rating based on the gap between a student’s predicted score and actual score.
The value-added formula is supposed to measure the value of teachers. In such a crucial setting as the classroom, a mathematical formula is a limiting and inaccurate means by which to measure human behavior.
Since the Los Angeles Times published names and rankings of roughly 6,000 third- through fifth-grade L.A. Unified teachers based on value-added evaluation, teacher assessment methods have been hotly debated.
The formula, however, is flawed. It does account for external factors that play a powerful role in student achievement. Test scores and statistics should not define good teaching, nor become a priority for teachers.
Admittedly, there is value in the reliability and objectivity of numbers and statistics when it comes to assessing our educational system. But looking at a teacher’s effectiveness through the scope of a state test given once a year is both limiting and inefficient.
And if data is the way to go, then active dialogue is necessary. Teachers should be required to engage with the numbers and to sit down and have a conversation with each other about how to improve.
Students should not be left out of the conversation, either. It is crucial that student evaluations of teachers be taken seriously and incorporated into teacher assessment.
As the nation’s second largest school district, LAUSD’s evaluation system could pave the way for many other districts. Amending and adding to the value-added formula to go beyond the numbers and to find the entirety of a teacher’s worth is imperative, for both teachers and students alike.
Elena Kadvany is a junior majoring in Spanish.
The author wrote that “It does account for external factors…”. What external factors? Does the Author mean Socio-Economic Factors? I will have to “google” the LAUSD “value added” system of evaluation.
If it is SE-Factors, then the LAUSD is tackling the most “Vexing” problem of Education today. That of evaluating both the Teacher and Student on factors that are beyond one’s control.
I live in NYC and the discussion of Teacher Evaluation is very much the “Topic of the Moment” here also.

As Leonardo DiCaprio states in Inception, “once an idea has taken hold of the brain, it’s almost impossible to eradicate.”
A defining part of human history has been the sharing of ideas. It’s how knowledge spreads and how modern culture emerged.
But in recent years, idea-sharing has gone from slow diffusion of concepts to rapid, quick-fire streams of memes.
A meme is an idea that spreads by word of mouth, interaction or by mass media exposure.
Think of it as an informational gene or virus. A meme spreads and imprints itself onto people’s minds.
Although the concept has existed forever — morality lessons taught by parents can be considered memes — our memetic culture emerged only recently.
For an example of how a meme can spread, look no further than Charlie Sheen.
Yes, he’s a famous actor, but it was the memes he spawned that really drew people’s attention.
“Winning” and “tiger blood” have become pop phrases, and are even being used to advertise reruns of Sheen’s show and hawk products.
For another example, look at the line “I have come here to chew bubblegum and kick ass, and I’m all out of bubblegum.”
It’s a commonly referenced line, but how many people know it’s from the 1980s movie They Live? Better yet, how many people who quote the line have actually seen the film?
Memes are more prevalent today because on one hand, in the world today, it has simply become easier to talk to people.
Email, mobile phones, faster transportation, etc. all mean you can share that ‘LOLCat’ picture with someone far more quickly than you could 10 years ago.
But there’s also a cultural consideration. We as a culture are facing an information overload.
The streams of content and ideas flow so quickly and from so many areas, leading to a kind of cultural ADD.
Because of this, when a meme picks up, it really picks up. Parodies, remixes and saturation of memes are common.
A video clip of Antoine Dodson became a massively popular meme, spawning an even more popular auto-tuned remix by the Gregory Brothers.
But the problem with memes is they lose context.
A parody, random reference or remix of a context-specific idea can be entertaining, but is weakened in its effect.
Antoine Dodson’s manic outbursts were strange, yes, but they came in response to sexual assault against his sister.
Even though people know he wants everyone to “hide yo’ kids, hide yo’ wives,” when filtered through auto-tune and video remixes, his urgency and anger are cheapened.
Sure, not all memes start from something that serious. But the rise of this memetic culture has lessened the impact of serious topics, boiling things down to simple, funny ideas.
And there is another problem: Memes won’t last forever.
Rebecca Black’s “Friday” might have been a trending topic on Twitter for weeks, but will we remember it in a year?
Sheen tried to ride out his memes’ popularity with a live tour, but his first show ended with him being booed by the audience.
If you want to talk about 15 minutes of fame, memetic celebrities are a good example.
So is Charlie Sheen a cultural milestone? Unlikely. Tiger blood and bed intruders will fade, likely replaced by some equally popular but short-lived meme.
Everything is moving at such a ridiculous pace. It takes something really special to leave a lasting, significant mark on our lives.
What will do that? Most likely not a meme.

Ana Caravelle has a degree in psychology, but she is also a harpist and singer who has been interested in music since the age of four. Caravelle will perform at KXSC Fest this Sunday along with bands and musicians Abe Vigoda, Puro Instinct, Julianna Barwick, Sister Crayon, and Brook and River. Caravelle took time to answer questions for the Daily Trojan by email.
KXSC elements courtesy of Robert Fogg
Daily Trojan: What drew you to say ‘yes’ to KXSC Fest?
Ana Caravelle: KXSC Fest sounds like a wonderful event to play because it will be a festival drawing people together in an outdoor setting. I am always very interested in the spaces that we play in, as much as the music as we’re playing, because it’s the interaction of the space, the music and the people that makes the event.
DT: When did you first start seriously studying music? And what instruments and styles did you play?
Caravelle: I began studying piano at age four and since then, have done much dabbling in instruments such as guitar, voice, theremin, musical saw and, finally, the harp. I am drawn to the meeting point between experimental and folk music.
DT: How does your psychology degree influence your music? Do you plan to work in that field?
Caravelle: I like this question a lot because clinical work with kids is the key influence for my music. I see music very much through the lens of a little kid, and I don’t ever intend to stop doing that.
DT: Which musical artists will your fans be surprised to hear have influenced you? I’ve read, for example, that you were really into punk when you were younger. Does that or other disparate musical sensibilities still influence the way you work at all?
Caravelle: People could be surprised to hear that I’m influenced by heavier music like punk and electronic beats, when my music tends to be more gentle and acoustic.
I take influences from a lot of things that don’t necessarily sound like my music, because it’s more about the emotional input that they give me, like the raw and emotionally charged quality to some heavier sounds.
I put all of my emotion into music, all kinds of emotion, and that’s where these influences enter into the picture.
DT: What are some of your non-musical influences?
Caravelle: I’m currently influenced by Topanga, the place in which Ryan (a.k.a. musician Asura) and I live. It’s somehow still almost in Los Angeles, but you drive up the long, windy road and you’re shot straight into the mountains, totally enveloped in green. It can be really tough to live here but also incredibly rewarding, living literally in the middle of the woods where you have nothing to listen to but the blend of nature and your own thoughts. Gives you much time to reflect and create.
DT: What draws you specifically to Icelandic music?
Caravelle: Icelandic music is my favorite music, especially artists such as Amiina, Sigur Rós, Múm and Björk because of its ethereal and ever glowing, crackling, glistening quality.
I especially love Amiina’s philosophy of sampling and performing with natural sounds that bring audience members back to a familiar and childlike place.
DT: When people say that you remind them of Joanna Newsom, how do you feel about it? Do you appreciate the comparison or does it bother you at all?
Caravelle: I appreciate the comparison to Joanna Newsom because she is the one who showed me that this form of music was possible.
But I’m gradually moving away by introducing electronic components to the music and moving closer to the Icelandic sound.
DT: What were some of the inspirations on your album, Basic Climb?
Caravelle: The overarching inspiration for Basic Climb was the idea of contrasts, being low to the ground versus up high in the air, indoors versus outdoors, night versus day.
DT: How was the experience of having other musicians remix the songs on your album?
Caravelle: I thought this was an incredible experience, and I felt really lucky to have such extraordinary musicians reinterpret these songs in ways I never could have imagined.

Puro Instinct is gaining fame in the music world, making its way onto the bill at SXSW and landing articles in music publications like Spin magazine.
Sister, sister · The Kaplan sisters’ harmonies seem to echo their close relationship, which adds to the band’s chemistry and overall vibe. - Photos courtesy of The Windish Agency  
Puro Instinct’s sound is somewhere between something you’d expect to hear in a mythical forest with fairies and the soundtrack to a dark, psychological thriller.
This Sunday, the band will play at KXSC Fest, which will take place at E.F. Hutton park from 4 to 11 p.m.
With just the right balance of keyboard and ethereal vocals, this L.A. band creates psychedelic sounds that can take you back to the ’60s or ’80s.
The band’s calm, carefree manner makes it relaxing to listen to and creates an experience that allows you to step away from your  hectic life and get lost in the keyboard notes and guitar strumming.
Yet the haunting harmonies hint at something lurking underneath.
With 23-year-old Piper Kaplan as vocalist and her 16-year-old sister, Skylar, on guitar, the duo comes off as a pair of old souls whose harmonies and rhythms allude to complex thoughts.
The band is bolstered by members Brooke Murray (keyboard), Cody Porter (guitar), Austin Hinkles (bass) and Michael Baum (drums), and as a whole the band has a chemistry and relationship Piper describes as “effortless.”
Describing Puro Instinct’s music as influenced by punk movies and “lots of dark vibes,” Piper admits the idea of being in a band was, in a way, forced onto her.
Although she’d been recording music on her own, it wasn’t until a friend booked a show for Puro Instinct that the band really got started.
“We really didn’t have any expectations or goals … It was a timekiller,” Piper said.
Timekiller or not, most  wouldn’t think a sibling is the greatest person to be in a band with. Yet Piper stands behind her little sister, and even her ex-boyfriend, in the six-person band.
When it comes to her teenage sister, there is anything but the usual sibling bickering.
In fact, it’s likely Piper’s obvious affection for her younger sister that makes their voices jell so well.
“She’s a whiz. She’s the easiest to get along with,” Piper said.
Puro Instinct does not come off as fame-aching and overly philosophical.
For Piper, it seems, the performances and the energy of a band are important.
Less important is forcing a certain feeling onto listeners.
When it comes to what Puro Instinct wants fans to take away from their music, Piper feels she does not want to determine others’ thoughts.
“It’s up to them. They can take away whatever they want … I don’t want that burden,” Piper said.
Despite being practically coerced into her current music career, Piper stresses that music was always a part of her life, so being in a band does not come as a surprise.
“It’s sort of all I do anyways. My band is my life,” Piper said. “Everything kinda ties in with music and is somewhat related with music.”
With this attitude in mind, Piper’s vision for the band is simply to do what she loves.
