The Department of Public Safety will apologize to two individuals who were asked to leave an event hosted by USC Students for Justice in Palestine, according to a statement by Senior Vice President of Administration Todd Dickey.
SJP hosted “Los Angeles Campaign Kick off and Petition Circulator Training to Qualify the Israel Divestment Initiative for the California Ballot” in Taper Hall of Humanities on Sept. 19, along with the California Israel Divestment Campaign.
StandWithUs Executive Director Roz Rothstein and Senior Developer Gary Ratner, the individuals whom DPS officers escorted out of the event, said they attended the gathering to listen to the opinion of SJP and the Israel Divestment Campaign. StandWithUs is an organization dedicated to representing the Israeli view of the conflicts in the Middle East.
“We just wanted to find out what was happening and some more information about it,” Ratner said. “Roz and I went to USC with the complete understanding that anybody could go to this meeting.”
Upon arrival, Rothstein said attendees at the event who recognized Ratner and her began to yell at them.
“They said, ‘You can’t be here, you can’t come in,’” Rothstein said. “I said, ‘I don’t think you can do that.’”
The event discussed the Israel Divestment Campaign, a measure that would require the Public Employees’ Retirement System and the State Teachers’ Retirement System to participate in a divestment process with some companies that practice business in Israel. Californians will vote on the  measure in the next statewide election after the upcoming one in November.
SJP President Marwa Katbi called DPS to the scene and the officers escorted Rothstein and Ratner outside of the room.
“Given that they were not well received, were causing an environment of extreme discomfort and heightened tensions within the room, I made a decision to call DPS and have officers handle the situation from that point onwards,” Katbi said in an e-mail.
Katbi said she allowed DPS to handle the situation independently after officers arrived.
Though university officials declined to specify any details of the incident or infractions that might have occurred, the administration plans to continue its ongoing investigation of the incident, the statement from Dickey said.
DPS Capt. David Carlisle said he could not comment on the matter as it is still being investigated.
Ratner said DPS told him that because SJP had rented the space, they were allowed to control the event. The DPS officers stated that the event was private and asked Ratner and Rothstein to leave. Ratner, however, disagreed.
“We even printed out the invitation to show the police that there were no restrictions [at the event],” he said. “You didn’t have to be a supporter of this or that.”
Dickey said DPS officers would receive training to handle similar situations in the future and student groups would be reminded of university rules.
“The University of Southern California is committed to freedom of expression and open inquiry,” he said.
Correction: A previous version of this story stated the Israel Divestment Campaign would target businesses that “aid Israel in violating human rights and international law.” That is incorrect. The story has been corrected and the Daily Trojan apologizes for the error.
@against_empire
Note the correction at the bottom of the article; they changed the sentence. Do you really think that I have the time to create a fake quote? Come on.
I don’t know what DPS was thinking. There is no history of violence between these two groups!
Would DPS ever be so quick to throw out Muslim students from an event held by Jewish orgs? Of course not because in our politically correct campus, if you dressed yourself with turbans and tunics, you will be above reproach but if you dress like a “typical Westerner, you are fair game for security to pounce on you and throw you out of an “open” event.
This is so typical of SJP – drown out and eliminate any opinions that differ from their own. I suppose that is also one of the major themes that plague Palestine and the surrounding areas. I will say this straight out – the people in that region of the world are not very open to listen to other people’s opinions and that is obviously evident in this “open” meeting where people are being physically ejected by security.
This is why the Middle East is going to have trouble a thousand years from now and why there will never be real peace. The people in that region just love to fight and NOT listen to other people. For all the politically correct Westerners who feel they are making positive steps toward peace, you are just flaming the fuel in the fire by censoring yourselves with your liberal politically correctness that avoids the 800 lb pink elephant in the room.
Does your correction mean that the Israel Divestment Campaign will NOT target businesses that “aid Israel in violating human rights and international law”?
Then what businesses will it target?
Please clarify.
Good God. Why so much outright hatred for Jews? No wonder they think they’re the most persecuted people on the planet. Some USC students can’t even accept them. Zman you’re a disgrace bro.
Dave
You are an idiot.. I’m not hating Jews.. I am being critival of Israel’s policy of occupation,deprivation of human rights and murder.  Israel is a rogue state.  That’s just a fact.  I’m suprised you didn’t play the holocaust card.. That one has been used up though,so I guess that’s why..
Next thing you know, people will be arrested by the police for trying to spread the word of Christianity in public places and near mosques.  That’s right, that has already happened in Detroit, MI.  Believe or not….not hard to research.
If Arabs kick Israelis out of the same room, when they are sitting quietly just because they are “uncomfortable” as Marwa says… what makes anyone think they will LIVE in peace with Israelis.  No wonder the Palestinians love terrorism so much – there is no concept of coexistence and mutual respect in Arab culture.  Americans have to understand, Israel wants Peace – Palestinians, as an be seen here, definitely do  not.
excuse me but the actions of some students in SJP, whether warranted or not, do not reflect the views and desires of the Palestinian people.  That is a false assumption.  The Palestinians do want peace and have renounced the use of violence.  Divestment is a non-violent movement with the same application as was used in Apartheid South Africa.  And while equality was achieved in S. Africa through non-violence, do not assume that their wasn’t any violence at all.  There will always be those one or two people who’s actions cannot be controlled or accounted for.  The same goes with India and Gandhi’s movement for liberation from Britain.  Gandhi chose non-violence but it doesn’t mean that everyone struggling for independence in India subscribed to his methods.
Natasha
It’s Israel who doesn’t want peace.. You have no understand of what is really going on over there.  You turn on the TV and watch CNN,Fox News/ MSNBC and think that you are getting the truth… What you are getting is the pro-Israel propaganda bought by the Jewish-American lobby AIPAC.. IT is a lie.. Israel’s occupation is the reason that there is no peace over there.. They occupy lands from multiple countries have just today continued to buld settlements in territories that they recently took from the Palesitinians.
against_empire – Thats the dumbest thing i have ever heard..
only open to a specific anyone***
meaning it never said that the meeting was only open to those with similar beliefs.
@against empire
“It was a workshop. The meeting had a specific purpose, it is not acceptable to attend a purposed meeting with the intention of disrupting or preventing the meeting from achieving itself. It is nonsensical to attend a purposed, goal-oriented meeting in which people are being trained to complete a certain task if you yourself do not plan on learning and participating in said task.”
That’s the dumbest thing I’ve ever heard. The meeting was publicly advertised and did not state that it was only open to anyone. Furthermore, Rothstein and Ratner had no intention of “disrupting” or “preventing the meeting from achieving itself,” nor did they. To accuse them for that is wrong.
You don’t know that it wasn’t their intention.  And to be fair, I can’t be positive that it was.  But it still did not make sense for them to be their if they were not going to participate in the activity at hand.
I’ll also ask that you kindly refrain from making petty deriding insults such as “That’s the dumbest thing I’ve ever heard.”  I’ve made no comments of the sort and feel that such statements are undeserved.  This is a space for disagreement, decorum and respect should be maintained.
to be there*
If something is stupid, I will say so. I hope that others would do the same if I said something that silly. I didn’t insult you personally.
Anyway, it was their intention? Is that really your argument? A reader is supposed to know that ONLY THOSE WHO SUPPORT SJP AND THE IDC are permitted to attend because that’s their intention?! No, they didn’t explicitly state it but, it was their intention…what?! lol@that.
And it doesn’t make sense for someone who doesn’t support them to attend the activity? Really? So it doesn’t make sense to know what they are doing if you’re someone who disagrees with them? It makes perfect sense. It’s not like they were going to sabotage them or something, they just wanted to listen. People do the same thing in politics all the time.
Hey guys!
Request: save the Isreal vs. Palestine argument for somewhere else. You’re seriously deluded if either side thinks they’ll convince anyone in this comment thread.
I’m glad the DT corrected that sentence, though, since it hardly seems objective whether you feel that it is true or not. I hope they’ll avoid that kind of thing in the future.
seeing as the article is about israel-palestine i think it’s fine to have this discussion here.
however, most of my comments were geared towards issues i had with the article itself.
you also seem to have missed my point that the revised sentence wasn’t objective either.
@Locke the people in Gaza were not cheering on 9/11. Muslims died in those attacks to and that statement is completely irrelevant to this article.
@Nathan the sentence you quoted “The event discussed the Israel Divestment Campaign, a measure that would require the Public Employees’ Retirement System and the State Teachers’ Retirement System to participate in a divestment process with businesses that aid Israel in violating human rights and international law” is incorrect.
The article actually reads “The event discussed the Israel Divestment Campaign, a measure that would require the Public Employees’ Retirement System and the State Teachers’ Retirement System to participate in a divestment process with businesses that aid Israel.”
I actually find this sentence to be misleading in that it suggests that these businesses provide “aid” to Israel.  The use of the word “aid” suggests that Israel is some impoverished developing state, in need of help for its citizens and development. It suggests that the divestment is trying to take money away from an innocent civilian population.  This is entirely false.  The people of Gaza and the West Bank are the ones in need of AID.  What these businesses do with Israel is provide funding and shared technologies for illegal occupation and human rights violations by their immoral army & government.  Investing in war profiteering is neither neutral nor innocent.  Divestment IS.
As far as the actual incident is concerned, the purpose of the meeting was to be trained in signature collection processes for the ballot initiative.  It was not an informational forum.  It was a workshop.  The meeting had a specific purpose, it is not acceptable to attend a purposed meeting with the intention of disrupting or preventing the meeting from achieving itself.  It is nonsensical to attend a purposed, goal-oriented meeting in which people are being trained to complete a certain task if you yourself do not plan on learning and participating in said task.
An apology is certainly appropriate, and where is the law school to weigh in on the actions of DPS?
zname=ignorance
last I checked, it’s the folks who populate Gaza who were cheering on 9/11, not the Jews
well duH!!!!!!!  It’s Americans weapons that are used to kill thousands of palestinians.. We block every UN resolution that condems ISrael for their brutal attacks and we support israel in their constant occupation and opression.. You can’t expect them to like us..
Nathan are you out of your mind??
israel violates international law 24/7.  They’re a terorist state that is in the business of expanding their land and they classify resistance organizations as “terrorist organizations”.  They have a policy of slaughtering and starving out the population of Gazza.
What editor allowed this sentence to be published?
“The event discussed the Israel Divestment Campaign, a measure that would require the Public Employees’ Retirement System and the State Teachers’ Retirement System to participate in a divestment process with businesses that aid Israel in violating human rights and international law.”
Israel violates neither human rights nor international law, and the claim that it does is biased, unjust, and unsubstantiated.
And when is this supposed apology? is it going to happen monday, or has it already been emailed or when will it be?

Democratic gubernatorial candidate Jerry Brown has a slight edge over his Republican rival Meg Whitman, according to a new poll conducted by the Los Angeles Times and USC’s College of Letters, Arts & Sciences.
The poll is part of a series of six statewide opinion polls that began in November 2009 and will continue until the November elections this year. The most recent poll surveyed 1,511 registered voters in the state, including 887 likely voters, from Sept. 15 to 22.
Laurel Van Patton | Daily Trojan
About 49 percent of voters said they would vote for Brown if the governor’s election were held today, compared to 44 percent of voters who supported Whitman. Five percent were undecided, according to the poll.
Brown’s five-point lead is because of his double-digit advantage among likely Latino voters, who voted 55 to 35 percent in favor of Brown with 10 percent undecided, said Darry Sragow, interim director of the Los Angeles Times/USC poll.
“We included a very large Latino oversample in the poll,” Sragow said. “These data are stronger in relation to the number of Latino voters because the samples were much closer to the actual demographics.”
The poll showed that Whitman has had trouble connecting with voters, polling 12 points behind Brown on whether she “understands the problems and concerns of people like me.”
Whitman scored positively among only 36 percent of voters, versus Brown’s 48 percent.
“We all noticed that [Whitman’s] support levels reached a certain point, then seemed to stall,” Sragow said. “Brown has been ramping up his campaign, so you’d expect to see his force solidifying.”
Whitman did score high, however, among voters who thought she had more “new ideas to help California,” scoring positively with 48 percent of voters; compared to Brown’s 32 percent.
Neither candidate has an advantage among voters on immigration or taxes, but potential voters believe Brown would do a better job on education by a margin of 47 to 33 percent.
“[Voters] are divided on whether they want a governor with business experience or government experience,” Sragow said. “They overwhelmingly prefer a governor who will be collaborative rather than confrontational.”
A majority of voters were also in support of Democrat Barbara Boxer in the race for the U.S. Senate. Boxer leads among 51 percent of likely voters, compared to 43 percent for former Hewlett-Packard Co. chairman and CEO and Republican candidate Carly Fiorina.
A majority of women support Boxer — 53 percent to Fiorina’s 39 percent — as do a majority of decline-to-state voters, of whom she holds 56 percent of the vote to Fiorina’s 34 percent.
“A large number of people still seem to remain undecided,” said Jane Junn, professor of political science at USC. “And this is among likely voters, adding uncertainty to the campaign.”
Brown will lose by 6% points.
Keep printing these wishful poll numbers.
They don’t do any good.

A team of four undergraduates from USC’s Marshall School of Business won first place at the National University of Singapore International Case Competition held at the National University of Singapore on Sept. 16, making it Marshall’s second case competition victory in a row.
Best-case scenario · Professor Quentin Fleming (center) and the four members of the Marshall case team won first place in Singapore. - Photo courtesy of Marshall 
The team — seniors Emily Dong, Nikunj Mistry and Calvin Tay, and junior Michelle Li — was one of two U.S. teams at the competition. Their opponents came from 11 different schools and seven countries, including South Korea and Thailand.
Members of the team were surprised when they found out that they had won the competition.
“We were ecstatic,” said Quentin Fleming, professor of management and organization and the team’s faculty adviser. “It was one of those moments.”
Dong, a senior majoring in accounting, said the team didn’t anticipate the win.
“We were hoping to place, because we didn’t expect first,” Dong said. “It was a good surprise.”
Mistry, a senior majoring in business administration and economics, said the case competition was particularly difficult because students were only given eight hours — as opposed to 24 to 48 hours in other competitions — to read a 20- to 30-page text about a business problem, analyze it and present their recommendations to a panel of judges.
“In a lot of case competitions, you know how much time you have and have a chance to prepare before you start the competition, but this time we really had no idea,” Mistry said.
The other U.S. team was  from UC Berkeley. Thammasat University from Thailand placed second and National University of Singapore placed third.
Fleming said that for USC, this win is particularly significant because it shows that Marshall students have a lot of initiative.
“They enjoy challenges and really step in and rise to the occasion,” Fleming said.
And this has been happening for a while.
“Marshall has been winning more than our fair share in the last two and a half years,” Fleming said. “We’ve really kicked into high gear.”
This is USC’s second victory at an international case competition since the fall of 2009. Marshall has also consistently done well in other international competitions, Fleming said.
USC regularly holds one of the largest case competitions in Los Angeles every spring. About 30 universities around the world attend and the USC team  has won that competition.
“I don’t think that was really good manners,” Fleming said.

The Los Angeles Times announced Wednesday that the 16th annual Los Angeles Times Festival of Books will be moving its home from UCLA to the USC campus next spring.
“After 15 years on the Westside, we are very excited to move the Festival of Books to its beautiful new home and have the opportunity to work hand-in-hand with USC to ensure we grow bigger and better in the future,” Los Angeles Times Publisher and CEO Eddy Hartenstein said in a press release.
The location was changed to allow for increased attendance and additional attractions. Event organizers chose USC because of its central location, additional parking and public transportation and new campus facilities, according to the release.
“The last festival brought in 140,000 people and we hope to have that or more over the weekend on our campus,” said James Grant, assistant vice president for USC media relations.
In an e-mail to faculty, President C.L. Max Nikias said he was thrilled the festival was moving to the USC campus.
“The Los Angeles Times Festival of Books is known for sparking just the kind of intellectual curiosity and energy that are at the heart of USC’s mission,” Nikias said. “It is a great fit for our world-class faculty authors and writing programs, as well as for our literacy work in the community.”
The Festival of Books began in 1996 with the goal of bringing authors and readers of all ages together for a two-day event. Approximately 130,000 to 140,000 people attend the event each year, making it the largest and most prestigious book festival in the country.
The event, which is free to the public, features more than 400 authors in genres ranging from poetry to comic books.
Also in attendance are booksellers, publishers and literacy and cultural organizations from a variety of communities in Los Angeles.
In addition, the festival hosts celebrity appearances, speaker panels, book signings, children’s activities, famous chefs and local musicians.
The Los Angeles Times will publish a map of the festival on its website and distribute a program guide on April 24, the weekend before the event.
Elizabeth Windler, a junior majoring in mechanical engineering, said she had never heard about the Festival of Books but thought it sounded like a good opportunity for USC.
“If there are authors there that I like, I will go,” Windler said.
Laura Escobar-Vallecillo, a junior majoring in communication, is a big fan of the Festival of Books.
“I’m so excited to hear that the Festival of Books is going to be here because it was such a hassle to find time in my schedule to head over to Westwood, find a ride there and find parking,” she said.
Escobar-Vallecillo said she thinks the event might help promote reading across campus.
“Hopefully this will encourage other students to take up leisure reading, even with our hectic college schedules,” she said.

Measure for Measure is considered one of Shakespeare’s problem plays — it is neither tragedy nor comedy in the traditional sense. The ambiguity and excessively complicated plot makes the play very difficult to perform in a coherent way with which the audience will truly connect.
Indecent proposal · Isabella (Karron Graves) struggles to maintain her purity as she gets caught up in a deal to save the life of her brother Claudio (William Patrick Riley) in Shakespeare’s Measure for Measure. - Photos courtesy of A Noise Within  
A Noise Within, Southern California’s only classical repertory theater, was ultimately unable to overcome these difficulties in its production of Measure for Measure, but solid leading performances captured the complexity of Shakespeare’s work and saved the show from complete contemporary irrelevance.
In the play, the Duke of Vienna, distressed at the corruption in his city, decides to leave Lord Angelo in charge, while secretly disguising himself to observe what happens in his absence.
Angelo makes it his mission to get rid of unlawful sexuality, and a young man, Claudio, is sentenced to death for having pre-marital sex. His sister Isabella, an exceptionally articulate novice nun, must plead on his behalf to Lord Angelo, who says he will only spare Claudio if Isabella will sleep with him. There are many twists along the way, all surreptitiously organized by the disguised Duke.
Karron Graves’ performance of Isabella was the strongest aspect of the show. The meaning of her words was always clear through the dense Shakespearean language, and her restrained energy commanded the audience’s attention in every scene. She captured the character’s purity and eloquence, never losing sight of her purpose in the beautiful language.
Part of the difficulty of performing Measure for Measure today is the modern audience’s inability to relate to what losing her virginity would mean to a young Elizabethan woman; but Graves’ fearful eyes and resolute, but trembling voice clearly expressed Isabella’s belief that giving her body would be worse than giving her life.
William Patrick Riley brought a charming, youthful energy to the character of Claudio and nicely showed Claudio’s transition from accepting death to save his sister to begging her for his life.
Though Geoff Elliott effectively portrayed Angelo’s inner conflict initially, the audience felt little of the violent passion there must be when he begins to force himself on Isabella, and his unbridled desire felt artificial.
Robertson Dean played the Duke with great authority, but some of the complexity of the character, the deceptive puppeteer of the whole show, fell flat. However, when the Duke finally expresses his own desire for Isabella, Dean subtly captured the moment’s moral ambiguity.
The comedic subplot of the play was executed effectively by Mark Bramhall, as Pompey the pimp, and Stephen Rockwell, as the promiscuous Lucio. They humorously captured the characters’ sarcastic, mischievous attitudes and got laughs out of all of Shakespeare’s clever sexual innuendos, which can often fail to translate.
Surprisingly, one of the highlights of the show was Thomas Moses, who makes a very memorable cameo as a drunk, stubborn prisoner Barnardine, who refuses to be executed. With an apathetic shrug at his pardon followed by a silent exit, Moses got the biggest laugh of the show without even saying a line.
A lack of strong directorial choices — necessary for the success of such a difficult play — kept the production from excelling beyond its generally strong performances. Director Michael Murray set the show in the present-day, but only perfunctory gestures were made toward the time period, such as an unnecessary water cooler or a sound system remote used once.
Simply dressing the characters in modern clothes does not inherently create resonance or relevance, and the production needed to embrace its setting more fully in order to make the choice meaningful.
Ominous music during scene changes, red lighting on the back walls and a sparse but bold set contributed to a kind of thriller-esque tone, but the mood wasn’t followed through during scenes or in the dialogue. Such a bold choice is respectable in the face of the play’s inherent ambiguity, but it ultimately detracted from the already questionable coherence of the play’s tone and purpose.
However, Murray’s staging made great use of the thrust stage, creating interesting tableaus with his actors. The final scene, with almost every character onstage and Shakespeare’s haphazard conclusion, was meaningfully handled. He left the play on an entirely uncertain note that draws attention to the moral ambiguity of the play as a whole.
In Measure for Measure, nobody is entirely good or entirely bad, and the audience is often unsure how to feel.
Strong performances and a compelling conclusion captured the complexity of Shakespeare’s work, but A Noise Within’s production ultimately demonstrated why it is considered a problem play without offering a coherent solution.
I haven’t seen this yet but I plan to, it’s one of my favorite Shakespeare plays. But why must there be a solution? The beauty of Shakespeare is that he doesn’t really provide solutions.  For the most part, there aren’t truly satisfactory solutions to life’s deeper problems. And if there are, well then each individual must figure those out for themselves. In the true spirit of Shakespeare and life as it really is, there shouldn’t be a solution provided, as each audience member (not entirely good or entirely bad) should make of it what they will.

A week ago, the No. 1 USC men’s water polo team moved to the top of the polls after edging California and UCLA to win the prestigious NorCal Tournament.
Veteran experience · Junior two-meter Matt Burton’s leadership has helped a young Trojan squad jump out to an undeafeated start. - Katelynn Whitaker | Daily Trojan 
On Friday and Saturday, the Trojans (11-0, 1-0) proved that they were more than deserving of their top ranking, thrashing No. 9 Pepperdine 13-4 in the team’s Mountain Pacific Sports Federation opener following earlier wins over Fresno Pacific and No. 16 Cal Baptist in the Lancer Invitational in Riverside, Calif.
“I really didn’t know what to expect when we started the year because we’re so darn young, but we have really good leadership,” USC coach Jovan Vavic said. “Joel [Dennerley], Peter [Kruzeka] and [Matt] Burton have done everything I asked them to do and the team has responded.”
But to say the Trojans have simply responded to the coaching staff and junior leadership could be a bit of an understatement.
So far, despite its inexperience, Vavic’s bunch has notched 11 consecutive wins — including resounding victories against several top-five programs — en route to earning its No. 1 ranking. In short, the Trojans have surpassed all expectations, and Saturday’s showcase with Pepperdine once again proved  the group’s maturation.
After building up a 5-0 first quarter lead against the host Waves, the Trojans continued their offensive onslaught, powering their way to an 8-1 halftime lead.
“It all started with good defense,” Vavic said. “Our guys shifted and helped each other. We forced them into taking poor shots.”
Unlike the weeks prior, they didn’t take their foot off the pedal and allow the opposition to get back into the game.
Instead, USC ballooned its lead to a 10-goal margin with four minutes remaining in the contest, before relinquishing just one last goal in the final moments. In short, Pepperdine was never afforded the opportunity to even make the game competitive.
“It’s been a problem for the entire season,” Vavic said. “We would have a couple good quarters, then one bad quarter. But today, the captains talked about that at the beginning of the fourth quarter. They said, ‘No more. Let’s just focus and get the job done.’”
There was no shortage of scoring during the game. Redshirt sophomore driver Michael Rosenthal and freshman driver Nikola Vavic each recorded hat tricks, and freshman two-meter Jeremy Davie and sophomore driver Tobias Preuss also had multiple-goal performances.
Remarkably, it was the seventh multiple-goal outing for Vavic, the son of coach Jovan Vavic.
“It’s really no different than coaching any other player,” the elder Vavic said. “He’s really a spark player and he knows the game well. It’s fun to coach him because he’s really quick in understanding what we want him to do.”
Friday’s contests with Fresno Pacific and Cal Baptist provided even more offensive fireworks, as the Trojans finished with a total of 32 goals in two games, serving as preparation for their road date with Pepperdine. Fourteen players also knotted at least one goal during the two-game tournament.
“We were able to do some stuff in those couple of games that otherwise we couldn’t do,” Vavic said. “We tried a couple of things and it prepared us really well.”

The set-up: After three mediocre wins, the Trojans came to Washington State where they won 69-0 two years ago, hoping to repeat that feat against a struggling, bottom-level Pac-10 team.
Trailblazer · Senior tailback Allen Bradford led the Trojans with 84 yards rushing on seven carries. He has 277 yards this season. - Dieuwertje Kast | Daily Trojan 
The story: It took a few quarters, but USC achieved the blowout win it had been trying to get the first three weeks. The team racked up 613 total yards on offense to Washington State’s 323.
The Trojans looked shaky in the first half, giving up a touchdown on an end-around throw on the opening drive and throwing two interceptions, but the game was never really in doubt thanks to some big plays.
After giving up the early touchdown to Washington State’s no-huddle offense — something USC’s defense hadn’t prepared for — the Trojans tied the game on their first play from scrimmage, thanks to senior fullback Stanley Havili’s 59-yard touchdown run. They took the lead just seconds later when freshman cornerback Nickell Robey intercepted Washington State quarterback Jeff Tuel’s pass and returned it 25 yards for his first collegiate interception and score.
“It came from instincts, watching film,” Robey said. “When [Tuel] checked off the play, I just knew what was coming. I anticipated and jumped the route. It was an awesome feeling, like hard work paying off.”
Robey bounced back after getting beat for that earlier touchdown (albeit by a receiver who was eight inches taller and 43 pounds heavier than him in Jared Karstetter) by recording that interception and a second one in the second quarter.
“I think it says a lot about who the kid is,” USC coach Lane Kiffin said. “He’s got no problem getting beat for a touchdown and coming back. Think about what he went through this offseason — losing his mother who was his heartbeat, fabulous lady. He moved all the way across the country hardly knowing anyone but the coaches. If true freshmen can make plays this early in their career, they’re going to be a really good player.”
It was over when: Havili took the handoff from sophomore quarterback Matt Barkley with 11:31 left in the first quarter, cut back and broke a multitude of tackles to score a 59-yard touchdown and tie the game at seven.
That play signified the emergence of Havili this year, and seemed to be an early indicator that USC would be able to almost score at will.
Robey then intercepted Tuel’s pass and, after a short Cougar drive that ended with a punt, the Trojans went 76 yards in three plays — including a 58-yard catch and run by Havili — capped by an 11-yard touchdown pass to freshman wide receiver Robert Woods that put the Trojans up 21-7 just eight minutes into the game.
“We should’ve [scored every time we had the ball],” Barkley said. “We could’ve had 70 points if those turnovers had gone the other way.”
More discipline: USC played its most disciplined game of the season, committing only five penalties for 39 yards, a season low in both categories.
The Trojans had been among the leading teams in the country in penalties committed and penalty yards given up heading into this game, so Kiffin was proud to see his team keep the yellow flags off the field.
“I feel we were physical and a lot more disciplined,” Kiffin said. “Thirty-nine yards of infractions, that’s come a long ways.”
Special teams comes through again: For the fourth-straight game, the special teams recorded stats of notice.
Even though senior kicker Joe Houston missed his only field goal attempt, redshirt sophomore defensive end Wes Horton blocked a punt and junior offensive tackle Tyron Smith blocked an extra point.
The tenacity was something Kiffin planned in order to avoid his team coming out slow and underestimating its opponent.
“We felt like the players needed to feel the coaches’ aggressiveness,” Kiffin said.
The Trojans also didn’t punt on Saturday and only went for one two-point conversion, which they made.
Injury update: Junior defensive tackle Armond Armstead didn’t play, though Kiffin said he probably could have. Kiffin said he wanted to give Armstead some rest because he wasn’t 100 percent during the first three games.
Horton left the game late in the fourth quarter after being kicked in the back by redshirt sophomore defensive end Nick Perry. Horton fell down trying to make a sack and Perry fell over him. Horton said he still had some pain in his back but wouldn’t know about his status until he got X-rays upon returning to Los Angeles.

If you were listening really hard, you might have been able to hear a collective groan ring throughout Los Angeles on Saturday as Washington State scored the first touchdown of the game against USC. It was as if Trojan fans knew exactly what they were in for over the next three hours — inconsistent USC play allowing a much weaker opponent to stay in the game for much longer than it should.
Though it took the Cougars all of three and a half minutes to score, senior fullback Stanley Havili needed just a fraction of that to make everything right once again in Troy.
Havili took a handoff from sophomore quarterback Matt Barkley on the Trojans’ first offensive snap and proceeded to embarrass the entire Washington State defense, breaking tackles and juking players en route to a 59-yard score.
And he didn’t stop there.
Havili, apparently unsatisfied with just leading the Trojans’ ground attack, went on to post a team-high 107 receiving yards and a touchdown on five catches.
The 187-yard day might be dampened by the fact that it came against a Cougar defense that would fit in better in the Pullman high school system than the Football Bowl Subdivision, but the benefit of his work remains every bit as important. On the whole, the Trojans have looked anemic this season, and Havili’s offense provided the fastest possible cure to their disease.
Although this isn’t the first instance, it was certainly the most obvious example of the veteran running back showing that he has no intentions of letting this new squad fall short of the bar that previous USC teams have set so high.
The senior’s contributions to USC expectedly flew under the radar — fullbacks usually are not given the credit they deserve in football, as their primary job is to block — but Havili is being noticed week in and week out as a leader of not just the offense but the entire team. And because USC’s roster is saturated in inexperience, Havili has the opportunity to take on a patriarchal role of sorts and provide a base of consistency from which the offense can build upon. Without the senior, the growing pains that have been seen thus far this season would be substantially greater.
Havili did not get to this point in his career without first having to undergo some change of his own. The fullback capped a disappointing sophomore season by being ruled academically ineligible to play in the 2009 Rose Bowl, which USC won 38-24 over Penn State. Earlier this season, he punched teammate T.J. Bryant during an altercation, injuring the junior cornerback severely enough to warrant cheekbone surgery.
Yet, Havili dealt with his problems in the best way possible — by learning his lesson and moving on. He improved his grades and now seems to have improved his relationship with Bryant, telling the Los Angeles Times that the two are “on good terms.”
And if his work on the field isn’t enough to convince you of his renewed devotion to the team, keep this in mind: Havili is spending his last year of eligibility in college at a school that can’t even go to a bowl game. He had the chance to transfer and use his talents elsewhere, but he decided to stay and contribute to the same team that he has been with his entire career.
USC might not have needed every yard from Havili in its stomping of Washington State on Saturday, but the team won’t have the luxury of playing the Cougars every week. If the Trojans are going to continue to win this season, they will need the bruising fullback that was all over your television screen Saturday — not only for his football talents, but his leadership as well.

After a search that took No. 18 USC halfway across the Pacific Ocean to Hawaii and halfway across the country to Minnesota, it finally found its identity among the wheat fields of the Washington-Idaho border.
Pulling away · Senior wide receiver Ronald Johnson had 69 yards and a touchdown on five receptions Saturday in USC’s win against Washington State. The receiver leads the team with 249 yards and five scores through four games in 2010. - Dieuwertje Kast | Daily Trojan 
Playing a Washington State team (1-3, 0-1) that has ranked at or near the bottom of the Pac-10 in recent years, the Trojans (4-0, 1-0) ran the ball for 285 yards and held the Cougars to just 16 points to come away with the lopsided 50-16 victory.
“I thought that was the closest we’ve played to a complete game, which has been our focus for two weeks in a row now — to try and put things together,” USC coach Lane Kiffin said. “We want to be tough and we want to be disciplined, so I think we were that way. Lopsided rushing yards is [the stat you] look at and know you’re playing well.”
With the talk all week revolving around which running back would start, out of senior Allen Bradford, redshirt junior Marc Tyler and freshman Dillon Baxter, senior fullback Stanley Havili got the nod and put together a day Godzilla would dream of.
The senior had nine touches for 192 yards and two touchdowns, including a 59-yard tackle-breaking run on the first play from scrimmage for USC after Washington State scored on the opening drive.
“You know what, the hole was huge. I cut back, Rojo made a huge block — I remember seeing him block 44, which was great — and it helped me bounce outside,” Havili said. “It feels really good to touch the ball.”
Kiffin used Havili almost exclusively in the first quarter because USC came out in the no-huddle offense. Kiffin said Havili knows the protection schemes the best, so he uses him as the single-back when USC uses that style of offense.
Havili validated his coach’s confidence, gaining yards through the running and passing games. The fullback was the Trojans’ leading receiver, tying a team-high five catches and recording a team-high 107 receiving yards to go along with his 80 rushing yards.
“Stanley is so versatile, he’s a fullback, slash running back, slash receiver,” Bradford said. “I mean what can’t Stanley do?”
Havili stepped up for the offense in the first half when sophomore quarterback Matt Barkley was struggling. Barkley threw two first-half interceptions — one coming on the goal line when a safety dropped back into coverage that Barkley failed to see — but picked up his game in the third quarter to finish with 290 passing yards and three touchdowns before being pulled just before the end of the third quarter. It was the start of the game, however, when Barkley threw two interceptions in his first five passes, that concerned him.
“I’m happy with how we did as an offense, but those picks definitely tarnish what happened throughout the game,” Barkley said. “That first quarter, those turnovers, even [Bradford’s] fumble — it doesn’t feel right and makes this win not feel so good. We obviously need to do something to correct those.”
On defense, freshman cornerback Nickell Robey had two incerceptions, including one he returned for a touchdown to put USC up 14-7 early in the first quarter. Sophomore safety T.J. McDonald added another as the Trojans were able to stop Washington State’s offense, especially inside the red zone.
“We didn’t change anything [after Washington State’s first touchdown],” senior cornerback Shareece Wright said. “We just made plays and did what we got to do.”
With the win, Kiffin became the first USC football coach since Jess Hill in 1951 to start his USC coaching career 4-0, but Kiffin said earlier in the week that nobody probably played a schedule as easy as this team has. Kiffin dubbed these first four games USC’s “preseason,” and now the Trojans come home as they begin to face the toughest part of their schedule.
“I really looked at it where we would normally have four preseason scrimmages, where we could tackle and have 100 plays and really get to know our team. We didn’t have that,” Kiffin said. “Our goal was to get through these four games, not worry what the score was, come away 4-0 and healthy by playing a bunch of players, and getting an idea of our roster — I think we have that.”

Sigmund Freud’s theory of psychosexual development helped begin the release of a centuries-long cultural repression about anything regarding sex. Sixty years ago, no one could find information about sex outside of the parental birds and bees talk without risking social stigma.
Today, the rise of public school sex education and widespread availability of contraceptives in a medical system based on confidentiality and anonymity has unlocked conversations about sex for virtually anyone who wants to learn — which, according to Freud, is everyone.
Sullivan Brown | Daily Trojan
At last, the people have been freed.
This sexual freedom abounds so readily in our culture that we can’t even turn a corner without seeing sexually suggestive advertisements or hearing a sexual innuendo. We’re bombarded with trailers for movies such as Easy A and The Virginity Hit that reinforce the notion: “hey, awkward teens exploring sex — funny!” I’m suddenly reminded of 1984 and how freedom is slavery.
As the media craves more and more sexual tropes to display — because, let’s face it, sex sells — more haze and confusion is added to the endless number of stories about sex we’ve already been told. Raunchy films, such as American Pie, that retread the same awkward narrative of sexual blunders have only exacerbated the anxiety young people already experience with sex.
Instead of being a freely discussable topic, the salience of sex in the media is rapidly becoming a different kind of mass cultural repression, one where young people assume everyone knows all about sex and that anyone who doesn’t is a loser. The result is a prevalent pattern of silence and misinformation.
The recently released movie, The Virginity Hit, caused some controversy with billboards that read “Still a Virgin? For help call 888-743-4335.” Though obviously a publicity stunt to promote a movie following the trend of Superbad, Youth in Revolt and The 40-Year-Old Virgin, the rising grassroots popularity of The Virginity Hit reflects how the plotline popularized by American Pie has been ingrained in the cultural language we use to talk about sex.
It is far too common these days to hear someone reference a movie when explaining the social dynamics of sex, with names like Stifler mentioned ubiquitously among young people.
I’m all for enjoying First Amendment rights by putting out movies that expose topics previously deemed taboo, but the suffocating presence of the raunchy sex movie has blurred the lines between the “normal” sex story and the fictional one. With movies like The Virginity Hit and Easy A parading as pseudo-documentaries society is fed more sex stories that actually detract from healthy sex education.
The only thing these movies perpetuate is that the label “virgin” is akin to social leprosy.
Aristotle wrote that comedy functions by featuring characters the audience identify as inferior to themselves. The audience can then revel in their follies because they recognize and possess the traits those characters lack, and so can avoid those same follies.
But with more movies blurring the line between reality and fiction, creating characters that are promoted to be real, such as The Virginity Hit, the laughs become the result of tragic social schizophrenia. Instead of laughing off the characters in such movies, they become the fiber of the modern language of sex, with more audiences identifying unhealthily with such characters and adopting the value that one must lose his virginities at all costs to avoid the same plight.
With sexually themed movies so prominent in today’s society, the chances young people will exit those theaters admitting their own sexual ignorance is growing slimmer. No one wants to be the outcast who doesn’t get the sex jokes; the ignorant portion will remain silent or contribute with movie-based sexual misinformation to fill the void of real-life experience.
And which is more likely — that teens will seek the safe-sex education and risk exposing their ignorance or remain silent and jump at the chance to shed their perceived inexperience? The result is that these movies, originally works of fiction, cause their plots to play out in real life.
I admit, I enjoy lewd comedy now and then. It only bothers me to see that one awkward teenager in the audience leaving the theater, laughing nervously among his friends as they relive graphic points of the movie and proclaim their proud sexual achievements. It feels wrong that the awkward teen’s only two choices to avoid being a social outcast are silence or lying.
Today’s young people need a culture willing to educate about sex as much as the media is willing to joke about it.

Well young man,
it looks like you are hitting the books. I can see you are getting a good education with your name drop of Aristotle and Freud. Bravo, keep reading, drinking ovaltine and messaging your scalp and I’m sure you will ace all of your classes. But I have a problem with your words.
I think your article is saying that young folks are learning the wrong things about sex from the media, and thus the media should be changed to be less confusing and inaccurate. I disagree because I think young folks should learn about sex from their family or in school, but not from the media. 
When my son Melvin was 18, I sat him down in the kitchen and explained the birds and the bees with some naughty kitchen magnets I bought for the lesson. Now he was a sweating and squirming, because he wasn’t used to learn’n ’bout these things from his ma, but he got the honest truth. I’ve taught my youngins from very an early age that the media is full of fake and crazy business, and they have never been confused since.
A neighbor child who’s parents never taught him such things, well, he saw one of them superhero movies and jumped off the roof thinking he could fly. Luckily he landed on his unemployed father who was sunning himself on a towel, and that child survived, But I worry about all of you kids who are looking for the media to explain everything. You kids should not be jumping off a roof, sexually. You should have the truth. If your school and parents aren’t teaching you about the sex, I’m sure there are many mothers who can come to class and show you how things work. We could even bring our magnets!
Well, that something to think about, I reackon.
Your writer didn’t give Freud enough crdit.
He would also endorse having teens learn what is behind and undrneath the attraction of sexuality
Such iformation might make some of them more reflecetive and prudent.
The higfh schools have failed the young by skirting the nature of sexuality. They have also wasted Freud’s wisdom..

Thanks to the influx of the popular Korean-fusion food truck Kogi and its imitators, an Angeleno is most likely to think of sesame seed-sprinkled beef on corn tortillas when talking about “Korean street food.”
Obviously, street food takes a different scene in the actual streets of Korea. Instead of the rumbling, Twitter-savvy, colorful trucks that line the streets of campus, street food in Korea typically takes a more traditional stand. Called pojangmacha, these stationary food stalls are usually longtime local hangouts built into unremarkable tents.
Ddeokbokki (Spicy rice cakes) - Sophia Lee | Daily Trojan
As chaste and unadorned as they might seem, pojangmachas never fail to lure a young student returning home from school with the wicked sizzle and aroma of deep-fried red bean donuts or draw in couples for a cozy hot snack of fish cake skewers in the winter.
Unfortunately, the sprawling landscape of Los Angeles and its strict health regulations mean that it’s difficult to recreate an authentic pojangmacha. But for curious students who just want to get a taste of some popular street food the way they do it in Korea, all it takes is a 15-minute ride into Koreatown.
Hoddeok: glutinous honey pancakes
Let’s start with the least intimidating item first. Drive out to the California Market on S. Western Avenue and Fifth Street. There, you’ll find a small, seemingly forgettable food stand just outside the market — until you take a waft of the heavenly smell of fried pancakes.
These flat, dense glutinous rice cakes called hoddeok are stuffed with brown sugar and cinnamon, which caramelizes into a thick, flavorful syrup that will ooze out and burn you if you’re not careful.
The best way to describe this cinnamon-infused snack is that it’s a hybrid of all the best components of the McGriddle, a Cinnabon and mochi — rolled and flattened into a pancake and fried into a crunchy, gooey and chewy syrup bomb.
Ddeokbokki: spicy rice cakes
All sugared out? Time to spice things up a bit with ddeokbokki, a dish of cylinder-shaped rice cakes stir-fried in a sweet and spicy sauce.
Don’t let the redness of the dish scare you. The main ingredient in the sauce is gochujang, which is a traditional Korean red pepper paste that is actually sweeter than it looks.
You don’t need to go some place fancy for this dish. Ddeokbokki is one of those dishes that is made differently in every kitchen. Any food stall in a Korean supermarket or a food court at Koreatown Galleria will sell a decent plate of ddeokbokki. Koreans usually eat it as a snack, but with the fish cakes, hard-boiled egg and vegetables mixed in, it can also make a satisfying meal.
Jokbal: Korean pig feet
Pig knuckles aren’t just for the Germans. Head over to Eighth Street Soondae or any Korean supermarket, and try it the Korean way — simmered for hours in soy sauce, sugar and various seasonings, then sliced and served with various kimchis and shrimp sauce.
The prominent feature about jokbal is not the taste, but the texture. The perfect jokbal comes with three even layers of succulent fat, tender meat and chewy skin.
Just forget that it comes from pig feet and dip it into a salty sauce of fermented shrimp, or wrap it up in fresh lettuce with kimchi and a dab of pungent soybean paste. Then pop it into your mouth and let the fat melt away on your tongue, leaving behind a savory jelly that soaked up all the lovely spices of the broth it was cooked in.
Jokbal has some attractive nutritional properties too. Ladies, forget those expensive face creams — jokbal is high in collagen and elastin, which are supposed to keep skin young and supple.
Soondae: Korean blood sausages
After getting warmed up with a milder sampling of these exotic foods, perhaps you’re feeling a bit more daring. Order another round of Korean rice liquor at Eighth Street Soondae and brace yourself for some hardcore street food: soondae, or Korean blood sausage.
As far as organs go, soondae is considered mild. It’s not the usual sausage you would imagine that is a puree of mystery meat and fillers. Typically, the dish is made with pork intestines, but very little of the pork meat itself.
Instead, the skin of pork intestines is stuffed with a mixture of cellophane noodles, sweet rice, pork blood and masking flavorings, such as garlic and scallions. The sausage roll is then sliced into inch-thick ovals and served with fermented shrimp sauce and seasoned salt. The overall flavor is mellow and rather bland, until you dip it into the sauce and salt to let the delicate taste of pork blood pump alive.
Like jokbal, soondae is a perfect accompaniment to liquor and beer. It can also be a meal when served in a rich pork broth with a bowl of steamed rice. The noodles in the sausage soak up all the savory flavors of the broth, making each bite of soondae slices burst with great pork juices.
Beondegi: Boiled silkworm pupae
Unless you were raised eating it, this popular Korean snack is reserved for those with the bravado of Anthony Bourdain.
Beondegi is silkworm pupae, boiled and seasoned, served steaming in their crunchy shells. Korean school children and adults alike can be found happily munching on this snack, though it won’t be found cooking in the street because of its highly unpleasant odor.
Beondegi, however, can be readily found in cans at Korean supermarkets. Seek it out if you dare, but don’t say you weren’t warned. Beondegi is heavily seasoned, so it really isn’t too strange or disgusting — if you can get past the appearance of tiny worms staring at you, that is.
Sophia Lee is a sophomore majoring in print and digital journalism. Her column, “That’s What She Ate,” runs Mondays.
As a Korean person, some of these exotic, esoteric (even to me) Korean foods are kind of gross; e.g. beondegi and soondae. Yeah, call me close-minded or *gasp* ethnocentric.
I’m Married to a Korean woman who is a very very good cook and i love almost everything she makes. One thing the Author forgot to mention in Koreatown is Kyo Chon Chicken. Possibly the best Chicken wings you will ever have in your life. Working for FMS i have given the Area manager for Kyo Chon the names and numbers of people to contact to bring a franchise to campus hopefully within the next couple of years. The location at Freshia market at Torrance blvd and Crenshaw was closed down about 1 year ago. There are 2 locations in LA. ! in Koreatown and 1 in Westfield mall(Fox hills) in Culver City.
Cool! I have to say, I didn’t know some of the more exotic street foods were readily available here, so this has me craving a new foodie adventure. Thanks!
[…] P.S. By the way, if you’re interested, check out what this week’s column on Korean street food. […]

On Sept. 25, the Grammy Museum at L.A. Live was one of the 1,300 venues that opened its doors to the public free of charge, as part of Smithsonian magazine’s sixth-annual Museum Day.

“There are over 50 actual music museums in existence,” said Tracy Strann, the planner of Museum Day at the Grammy Museum and the mueseum’s director of external affairs. “But here in Los Angeles it is certainly very new.”
Just less than two years old, the 30,000-square-foot music museum hosts four floors of temporary and permanent exhibits, along with entertaining and educational interactive stations. The Grammy Museum is filled with exhibits that portray not only the personal impact songs and songwriters have on their audience, but also the deep social and cultural influence of music.
“[The museum] is very deep in content,” Strann said. “Honestly, I’ve been here with the museum long before we opened and I still haven’t done everything.”
From visual showcases such as the messy and jumbled handwritten lyrics of the song “Stan” by Eminem, to the paintings and sketches done by Janis Joplin, and even Elvis Presley’s D-18 Martin Guitar, there is certainly something here for every generation and every taste.
One of the most interesting and interactive pieces that Strann said she is particularly fond of involves the eight pods on the third floor that are part of the “In the Studio” exhibit.
Each pod offers a different step in the process of recording songs, such as picking different beats and samples to add to the mix. Through a touch screen and film footage of prominent artists, engineers and producers, these mini-studios allows visitors to experience firsthand all the work that goes into making their favorite songs.
The third floor houses the Red Carpet Showcase of Grammy outfits, an exhibit of particular interest for fashion lovers who watch the Grammy Awards every year just to see what the stars are wearing.
Featured outfits include the light-up suit Kanye West wore in his 2008 performance of “Stronger” with Daft Punk and the infamous Versace gown worn by Jennifer Lopez in 2000. Another recent acquirement is Taylor Swift’s sparkling blue Kaufman Franco gown worn to this year’s Grammy Awards ceremony.
On the fourth floor, the museum hosts an exhibit called “Songs of Conscience, Sounds of Freedom,” which explores the power and affect songs and artists have had on the history of the United States. The exhibit includes a timeline of music that go back as far as the American Revolution, where songs such as “Yankee Doodle” were a part of the politics and culture of the country.
“Crossroads,” also on the fourth floor, is another popular station where a colorful and interactive display of different musical genres is projected onto a long table. It has something for everyone, letting the museumgoer search through and explore approximately 160 genres of music, from disco to goth to Native American tribal songs to boogie woogie. With hours worth of foot-tapping material, “Crossroads” is a definite reason to visit to the Grammy Museum.
The Grammy Museum is currently working on creating a new interactive station donated by the Songwriters Hall of Fame. The exhibit is set to open on Oct. 18 and so far it consists of headphones, a synthesizer and a computer screen.
“They will be hosted virtually by some very prominent songwriters,” Strann said. “You will be able to … go in and hear what they’ve written but then you get to finish the song.”
Letting the museumgoer learn and experience the songwriting process seems to be the key component of what the Grammy Museum is all about.
Along with celebration of the sixth-annual Museum Day, the Grammy Museum held a special screening of Electrified: The Guitar Revolution in the plush-seated Clive Davis Theater. The Smithsonian film explored the history of the popular instrument, starting with the unlikely beginning of the “Frying Pan” guitar, which was made of steel and held on the player’s lap, a tool that eventually lead to the creation of the modern electric guitar.
Strann said the Grammy Museum is constantly staying involved with its community through events like Museum Day.
“[By being a part of Museum Day] I’m able to give people who normally might not be able to afford to come the opportunity to come,” Strann said. “And for me, that’s very important.”

Congress recently had a sliver of an opportunity to drastically improve the shoddy U.S. immigration policy, which has been languishing in one form or another after decades of border fence bluster and vigilante vitriol.
But once again, politicking got in the way of reform.
Sullivan Brown | Daily Trojan
The Development, Relief and Education for Alien Minors Act (formerly titled the Unnecessarily Cutesy Acronym Act) was one of several amendments tacked on to a defense spending bill that the Senate voted on Tuesday. The bill, which also included a repeal of the controversial “don’t ask, don’t tell” policy in its sidecar, was trumped in a 56-43 vote in which every Republican (and two Democrats) sided “nay.” The defeat will hamper the Dream Act’s chances of seeing legislation until after the November midterm elections — if ever.
The act is aimed at an especially vulnerable block of illegal immigrants: children who immigrated with their parents at a young age and who have spent most of their lives in the United States. Its provisions would offer citizenship to young adults who have been in the country for more than five years, arrived before the age of 16 and have graduated from a U.S. high school, provided they commit to two years of university education or military service.
Because of the stringent guidelines, the Dream Act had the potential to be the buffer for future immigration reform; it targets those who have lived most of their lives in the United States and sidesteps the polarizing criticism of back door amnesty by enforcing a rigorous career outline on its candidates.
Most importantly, the act poses a concrete solution for the yet-unsolved problem of how to accommodate undocumented immigrants in the higher education system.
For this demographic, straddling the cultural divide is all the more tricky. Assimilation is no longer the problem — advancement is.
The Supreme Court ruled in 1982 that illegal immigrants are entitled to free education from elementary through high school — a ruling that paved the way for future reform but created a glut of educated, successful high school graduates with nowhere to take their degrees.
These estimated 65,000 high school graduates a year (according to U.S. News & World Report) are stuck in limbo, awaiting further legislation, avoiding arrest, treading water.
Both Democrats and Repub-licans can be accused of parrying politics on the defense bill; Democrats tacked two very contentious (and disparate) amendments onto a seemingly unrelated bill, and Republicans responded with a filibuster that effectively put the kibosh on the bill and all its accoutrements.
Congress buried its chance to effect real change in all its machinations, but the Dream Act isn’t defunct yet — in fact, the day after the vote, it was reintroduced by Sen. Dick Durbin (D-Ill.) If it has any chance of seeing fruition after midterms, both sides of Congress will have to stop finagling for political points.
The Dream Act won’t solve the huge, structural problems of illegal immigration in the United States, but it’s also more than a Band-Aid improvement — a border fence, an extra minute man. Its success could open the door for more improvements to the system as a whole, and more sweeping changes.
Illegal immigration is a controversial issue in the United States, but also a human one — one that we can’t simply shove out the back door.

I believe all DREAMERS should be able to go to college if they want and qualify.  The American taxpayer should not pay for it with Grants, Loans or Work Study.  These DREAMERS should be charged the same rate as foreign students.   Perhaps La Raza, the Hispanic groups, Univision etc could form a scholarship group for them. 
While the DREAMERS are studying they should learn the language of the country they came from so they can compete there.  After graduation they can them return to their country of origin and work on becoming productive citizens while helping their countries become successful in the world market place.
To contribute another perspective, below is a statement drafted by a coalition of organizations which oppose the Act.
-mamartinez
————————————————————-
The Dream Act is a proposed piece of legislation that on the surface looks  like an educational bill for the legalization of undocumented youth, but is  actually a recruitment tool to fill the ranks of the military with this same youth.  The Dream Act says that if a young person graduates from a U.S. high school,  then s/he can get on a path towards some type of legalization if: s/he  completes at least 2 years of college towards a degree or does 2 years of military  service (in reality military contracts are 8 years.) Let’s analyze the reality.
The overwhelming majority of undocumented people, approximately 70 %, are Latinos. Out of approximately 12 million undocumented people in the U.S.,  over 7 million are Mexican and over 1 million are Central American. The sad  reality is that only about ¼ of Latino/as have ever attended college and only 11% of Latinos/as have a college degree. These are statistics for Latino/a  population not considering immigration status. La Raza Educators has provided more  specific statistics that suggests that only 1 out of 20 undocumented high school  seniors attend college. Since two years of college is needed to fulfill the  educational part of the Dream Act, it is likely that an overwhelming majority of undocumented youth will be pushed into the military in order to get a conditional green card. There is a long list of inequalities that make it  hard for immigrant youth to go to college. This bill does not address these  inequalities or the educational needs of undocumented youth but it addresses the needs  of the U.S. military, filling their ranks.
The heavy militarization aspect of the Dream Act became clear when two  important parts of the DREAM Act were removed. In an old version of the Dream Act,  910 hours of community service was one of the options to fulfill the  requirement for “legalization”. This option was taken away, as was the right to pay  in-state tuition. Because these two options are gone, more youth will see the  military as their only option.
This is exactly what the government is interested in. Senator Dick Durbin, sponsor of the DREAM Act, has said: “The DREAM Act would address a very  serious recruitment crisis that faces our military. Under the DREAM Act, tens of thousands of well-qualified potential recruits would become eligible for military service for the first time.” The military needs more recruits.  The politicians’ solution is to draft the undocumented.
We cannot be willing to sacrifice the lives of so many youth for the  benefit of so few. We should not support legislation that facilitates the recruitment  of youth to go off to war.
CAMI, Comite Anti-Militarizacion, supports higher education for all  students both documented and undocumented, however, we denounce the military  component of the DREAM ACT. Unfortunately, this deadly component is strategically  excluded from the debate by many Democrats and organizations who support the DREAM  ACT.
In essence, the DREAM ACT will create a defacto military draft for our undocumented youth. We say defacto because although students are given a “choice”, the fact is that the deplorable and inadequate conditions of  Latino schooling will make military enlistment the only “choice” for the  overwhelming majority of our undocumented youth. At the present time, it is against the  law to recruit undocumented youth into the US military, but with the passage  of the DREAM ACT, the recruiters will then be legally able to recruit our youth.
Historically racism and discrimination at home and in the military have adversely affected Latino youth who enter the military. During the Vietnam  War, Chicano and other Latino youth were sent to the frontlines in  disproportionate numbers. While Chicanos and Latinos were only 4.5 percent of the U.S. population, they were 19 percent of the casualties, some 80,000 Latinos  served during the Vietnam War.
With this reality, we pose the question: where will those students end up?  Dead on the battlefield in Iraq or Afghanistan? Will they join the 6,000 troops currently occupying the U.S./Mexico border? As the US continues to invade  and/or intervene in other countries, will our youth be forced to kill other poor  people in places like Venezuela, Columbia, Iran and Cuba?
We in CAMI do not wish to antagonize or minimize the efforts of the honest  youth and others who advocate for the Dream Act on behalf of undocumented  students. We wish to challenge all organizations that support the DREAM ACT to join us  in the struggle for the legalization of all students and our entire community. We  are all brothers and sisters in this struggle, but we must never negotiate the future of our youth in exchange for the legalization of a few of our  students.
We believe that our students and community deserve full and immediate legalization without having to serve in the military.
and yogurtland is open at gateway!!
One thing that seems to be overlooked in all the discussions of the DREAM act is that military service is already a path to citizenship for undocumented immigrants.  So the 2 years of college “requirement” is really the big thing being changed,  and unlike military service, where the immigrant is putting something of him- or herself into the citizenship equation, the 2 years of college “requirement” means the immigrant is taking another huge taxpayer subsidized benefit. Please. Let the imnmigrant prove him- or herself by giving, rather than taking.
what army in there right mind would want someone in it that has already proved they are a trader they snuck out on there own country in the middle of the night because the new country had better stuff what if we were at war with a country that had better stuff then us would they start dreaming again and sneak over to the other side and get all our loyal soldiers killed didn’t we learn any thing from the fort hood massacre
I could not agree more with Francis on this one!!! I could not have said it any better.
This article is tastelessly biased, but I guess that is why it is in the “Opinions” section.
LEAST WE FORGET IN NOVEMBER
 Let us make it very clear that anti-illegal immigration groups–the majority of them are not racist. The Tea Party is certainly–NOT–racists, as one can see in the mix of demonstrations; it’s composed of everybody who believes in the “Rule of Law.” Which doesn’t mean just white people? In the 1986 an Amnesty was proposed in Congress by the late Ted Kennedy, who promised implicitly–NO–MORE—AMNESTIES prior to being enacted. Since just the 1990’s there have been six small amnesties, under the radar, hoping that the general public didn’t realize it? Senator Harry Reid, speaker Pelosi and the mob of pro amnesty politicians, thinks the American people are stupid when attaching an immigration rider to the the War appropriations bill ten days ago. The Dream Act (The Development, Relief and Education for Alien Minors Act) had a limit under the house bill, but there are—NO- restrictions under Senator Reid, Dick Durbin who said nothing about people being able to be processed up to the age of 35, as being considered for citizenship under the Dream Act.  
My guess the majority of either parties, didn’t read the Dream Act attachment? By the time it would be passed, somewhere between 2 to 4 million students of illegal alien Mothers would be involved. The quality of high school performance didn’t seem to be a pre-requisite? It would be a grand award for parents who fraudulently moved to the United States. One thing Reid didn’t mention at all are those students legalized over 21 could sponsor their parents and immediate family circle. In addition even up to the age of fifteen you could still claim a visa under the Dream Act, even if you had just slid through the border. Senator Reid and top leadership cannot be trusted, as they will do anything to attract votes from the illegal minority population. Any promised Amnesty will attract people who didn’t even think of leaving there home country, until they heard that the generous American politicians were implementing another green card rush.   
We must be on our guard, as senator Reid may try to slip this law into the Senate once again, before November. Use the empowerment of your vote to demand that your US Senator does not vote for this Sen. Reid Dream Act by calling the Washington switchboard at 202-224-3121. The Public servants we voted into power, doesn’t seem to exhibit any compassion for the 15 American workers out of work. This week– a charade of summoning a comedian Stephen Colbert to Washington, to promote a path to citizenship for farm workers was madness and with better things to discuss? I think the whole situation was a prime embarrassment to all citizens. What did they hope to accomplish? If American non-skilled labor was paid wages they could live on, using more new generation machines to do the work of fifty, they would get more citizens hired?   
My grandfather picked grapes before the Second World War and his two boys also helped out during the harvesting season in the hot sun. One thing none of should forget that the farmers do not pay for the health care treatment and the farm workers children’s education, the US taxpayer does. Then while there here picking our fruit, vegetables any child born becomes an instant citizen. Females with multiple births can then claim citizenship for their infants and collect a whole lot of welfare benefits. This part of the 14th amendment has become a very expensive proposition for taxpayers. While citizens wait years to get on a list for low income housing, our government supply housing under section 8, food stamps, health care and a generous supply of welfare cash for each child. According to Pew Research Center there are approximately 8.5 million foreign nationals in jobs, citizens and legal residents should occupy.   
The only way we can ever take back America, for the people is sending a resonant message to Congress that we mean–BUSINESS! NO MORE AMNESTIES! We must dismantle the old boy political power network, starting with the removal of—ALL– incumbents. If you want to pay fewer taxes–we need to remove Sen. Harry Reid, Nancy Pelosi, Janet Napolitano, Sen. Barbara Boxer and a list of incumbents on both sides of the aisle in Washington. Keep an eye on Senator Reid as he stealthily nearly tabled E-Verify and has been singularly involved in blocking the 287 (g) local police illegal alien detainment and other immigration power plays. Outside of the main corruption in the Capitol, state assemblies are out to build a nest egg for themselves. That’s why we need to view carefully the Governors, Mayors and other elected officials who are supposedly representing us and should be under the gun. Finally–it’s a repeat performance that if we vote in the same old lot, nothing will change. 
There needs to be a contract with all new candidates, of no more “earmarks.” These things are in most cases taxpayer money, which is squandered on many incomprehensible projects. In November be assured that unknown numbers of illegal aliens will try and keep their pro-amnesty endorser in power, so all States with low security in polling stations should be scrutinized. The absentee ballot is specifically easy to forge without officials addressing this situation. As I said previously, the “honor System” cannot be trusted as today we must demand government picture ID to prove you are a citizen and have a right to vote—not just a utility bill.
 Texas and every other state needs to upgrade there security when it comes to voting, for as early the early seventies? Acorn, was involved in the a voter fraud controversy, but was batten down and seemed to have died out. High population of majority ethnic communities have been caught in undermining our voting system. for those citizens interested should GOOGLE–voter fraud and illegal immigrants. The Liberal press will suppress any articles about voter fraud, but their is a mass of evidence that this goes on around the country.
Grade cards for incumbents on immigration can be evaluated at NumbersUSA. $113 Billion a year says (FAIR) along with another $60 billion out the country, to foreign families. Nobody believes the lawmakers any more, as all the promises of enforcing illegal immigration has turned to bitter waters. The Sanctuary Cities and states like California are allowed to thrive, driving up taxes for its citizens. Even the Judicial branch is not fulfilling its duties to detain and deport all illegal aliens, they are just removing the criminals that taint America.
My fellow American, our country become a third world country, thanks to the corrupt politicians that betray our trust. You are right we must take our country back next November and fire these SOBS.
vote for America’s future in November.
I do not support the DREAM Act only because it marginalizes those that are here legally. We are worried about the illegals, something that is criminalized in every country I know except for the US. But what about the kids who are here legally but have no ‘support’ from congress because it is not politically expedient to do so. As Nina above said, the legal residents have to follow rules that send them back to their home countries. 
The author here said immigration should not be a pipe dream. I agree but it should be LEGAL.
The DREAM Act would be a great idea if it included ALL those brought here as children, who have completed high school and two years of college and are of good character.  Unfortuantely, it is only for ILLEGALS.  Children like my daughter, brought here legally, have no path to citizenship and must leave at age 21 when they are no longer classed as dependents of their parents.
Remove the word ‘UNDOCUMENTED’ from the Act and give young people brought here legally the same opportunity as those brought here illegally, and perhaps we can move forward.  As it is currently worded, the Act discriminates against young people brought here legally, and that’s wrong, stupid and unAmerican.
Families who came here the right way want to stay together, too.
There is a home for these children. It’s called their legal, home countries. NO to backdoor amnesty.
Completely agree with everything said in this article, congress needs to stop playing politics with the lives of hardworking people. I support the dream act !!!
I am a strong supporter of the Dream Act, and helping children get a proper education. Children of illegals are wanting to pursue and further their knowledge, but illegal acts made by the parents ultimately hurt their children. But these children are grown and raised in this country, that they proudly call home and they are more that willing to help their country. But restrictions and documentation problems prohibits them from doing so. Pass the bill get smarter and young people to rebuild this crippling economy and help fight for this nation.
Great Article, I support the Dream Act =D

After years of consideration, the Pac-10 is finally on its way to implementing an actual title game. The only question now is where it will be held.
The Pac-10 not only wants a venue that would promote the game, but a place where fans would be able to travel to in order to obtain the maximum attendance possible.
Possible locations include Las Vegas, Los Angeles, Seattle and Glendale, Ariz. Other suggested cities include San Francisco, Oakland or San Diego.
Many of the concerns with holding a title game in these cities, however, have to do with small stadium size (Las Vegas), bad weather (Seattle) and lack of originality (Los Angeles, since Pasadena hosts the Rose Bowl).
In the month of October, San Francisco will play host to the Pac-10 athletic directors, presidents and chancellors, who will discuss this issue as well as others pertinent to the conference, including splitting the conference in divisions.

Conventional wisdom suggests that the cutesy style of singer Katy Perry could not be a more fitting match for the peppy tone of the kids show Sesame Street. The star, along with other notable names including Jude Law and Amy Poehler, signed on to appear on the show’s star-studded 41st season.
Alongside the ever-popular Elmo, Perry performed a skit with a modified rendition of her song “Hot ‘N Cold,” in which she chased after Elmo while sporting a sleeveless green dress.
On closer look, Perry was actually a covered from the chest up by a sheer material. But that was not enough for some parents, who thought Perry’s outfit was too risqué for the children’s show.
Enough parents protested about her scantily-clad appearance to garner the attention of Sesame Workshop, which pulled the episode from the show’s itinerary.
In the end, it appears that Perry had the last laugh, making an appearance on a Saturday Night Live skit last weekend.
Her attire of choice? A low cut, cleavage-bearing Elmo shirt.
