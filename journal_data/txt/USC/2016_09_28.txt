The Trojans head to Oregon with one goal in mind — keep the ball rolling.
The team is 7-2, riding high off of a seven-game shutout streak and a series of high-scoring victories. With one conference game under their belt, head coach Keidane McAlpine feels that his team — which is ranked No. 9 in the NCAA — is right where they need to be.
“They’re starting to find a rhythm and an identity as a unit,” McAlpine said. “You’re seeing that in practice, in games, whenever they’re on the field together. It’s starting to click.”
So far this season, the key to success has come from the backline. The team broke the school record for consecutive shutouts after defeating Arizona 4-0 last week, notching their seventh in a row.
A major part of that has been two veteran players — redshirt senior goalkeeper Sammy Jo Prudhomme and senior defender Mandy Freeman. Both have racked up accolades throughout this season as they guided a young backline into the season. Prudhomme earned the ESPNW Player of the Week Award earlier in the month after blocking 17 shots in a weekend tournament in Alabama.
And this week, Freeman was named the Pac-12 Defender of the Week for her stifling performance against Arizona. The backline stopped 15 shot opportunities — 12 of which came in the second half — in order to keep a clean sheet. The performance exhibited a style of play and leadership that McAlpine feels is critical for his team to continue winning.
“The attention to detail is critical,” McAlpine said. “They bought into putting in the work and being diligent. The backline’s cohesion is really starting to come together, game to game.”
The defense’s success wouldn’t be possible, however, without the offense. The attacking front has transformed completely from last year, when the Trojans struggled to finish in the box and sometimes lost games that they controlled for most of the 90 minutes of play. This season, nine players have found the back of the net, with redshirt junior Alex Anthony leading the pack with five goals.
This is partially due to new personnel. After sitting out last season with an injury, redshirt senior Katie Johnson has come back with a passion, notching three goals in the first nine games of the season. And transfers like Anthony and Leah Pruitt are allowing for a new style of fast-paced play that puts opponents on their heels and allows the Trojans to take control of the tempo.
“We have more players who are good with wearing the pressure of scoring goals,” McAlpine said. “That means the rest of the team is a little more relaxed when they’re taking chances and finishing in box. We just have more personalities that are willing to accept being the goal scorer.”
That doesn’t mean he’s satisfied with where the team is at. After a dominant showing against the University of North Carolina, McAlpine feels that his team has struggled to piece together full games where they are in sync with one another. Though 15 to 20 minute spurts of cohesive play have resulted in a big payoff against unranked teams, McAlpine is aware that his unit will need to find their rhythm and stick with it as they continue with conference games.
Traveling to Oregon this weekend will give the Trojans two more Pac-12 challenges, starting with Oregon on Friday. The Ducks entered the season ranked No. 25, but since then has dropped out of the top rankings. Still, the team has only dropped one home game so far, partially due to playing on a turf field that switches up the style of play for many opponents.
Sunday’s game against Oregon State is expected to be slightly easier to handle — the team is 5-3-2 on the season and will be fresh off of a game against No. 11 UCLA just two days before. But the weekend will be important for the Trojans as they prepare for the following weekend’s matchups against No. 1 Stanford and No. 17 California. If the Trojans have any more last-minute fine tuning to do, it will happen in Eugene.
Coach McAlpine is the only good hire Haden made as AD to an existing program.

This weekend, the Women of Troy travel to the Rockies to play both Colorado and Utah. The team has been keeping morale high during practice, despite two hard losses last week against then No. 9 UCLA and No. 7 Washington. During the Washington game, both junior opposite hitter Brittany Abercrombie and junior outside hitter Niki Withers put up the majority of the kills. The No. 23 Trojans had to modify their game, since senior libero Taylor Whittingham was unable to play. However, head coach Mick Haley is not too worried about the team, as he believes that they are continuously improving. 
“Morale has been pretty good,” Haley said. “We kind of understand what we need to improve on. We know the season is one of those things where we need to get better.” 
Since the team is so young, the girls have been making it their top priority to work on communication. Whether it is between the setters and the hitters to find just the right setup for a good kill, or simply deciding in the moment whose ball it is, communication is essential. Haley likes to play within his system, but it is very difficult for that system to be successful if the girls are not talking to each other. Improved communication will also help with their serve receive, something the team has been working to sharpen all season. 
“If we could try to control the rhythm of our system a little bit better, the communication will help us with that,” Haley said. 
This Friday, the Trojans, who are 8-5 this season, play No. 20 Colorado. Since the team has been preparing for both Colorado and Utah, they have been working on Colorado one day, and Utah the next. Thursday, when they travel out to Colorado, they will shift their focus to the Buffaloes. Haley said that the game against Colorado could go either way because of how competitive the two teams are. 
“We always play a lot of sets out there, we always seem to get in a five set match with those guys,” Haley said. “You never know what is going to happen, but it is always a spirited battle and, certainly, there will be nothing easy in that match.”
The team will also play the No. 25 Utes this weekend, who have an 11-2 record. Haley said that the Trojans are starting to have better fluidity during practice that hasn’t shown on the court yet. This week the team has been working hard, and Haley believes this will translate into more success on the court.
“The way we’re working at this and the attitude of all the players makes me think we can’t help but get better,” Haley said. 
Friday’s game against the Buffs will be televised on Pac-12 Networks at 7 p.m. PST. For Saturday’s 6 p.m. tilt against the Utes, the game can be watched via live stream through Pac12.com.

So often in sports, something completely unrelated to the playing field happens, and yet, because of the connectivity of this world, things come together in a way no one could have ever imagined.
This week, the sports world was shaken by the sudden loss of Miami Marlins star pitcher José Fernández, who was killed in a boating accident early Sunday morning. In the Marlins’ first game back following the loss of Fernández, leadoff hitter and second baseman Dee Gordon honored Fernández by taking a pitch from the right side of the batter’s box — Gordon is a lefty and Fernández hit right-handed.
Then, after Gordon removed Fernández’s helmet and put on his own, he stepped to the left side of the plate and crushed a ball beyond the outfield wall. Emotionally, Gordon trotted around the bases and was greeted by his equally emotional teammates.
“I ain’t never hit a ball that far, even in BP [batting practice],” Gordon said to USA Today after the game. “I told the boys, ‘If you all don’t believe in God, you better start.’ For that to happen today, we had some help.” 
These types of events transcend sport. Luckily, such tragic events only enter the sporting world every so often, but when they do, those who are suffering are shown the support of a group unlike any other. 
Fandom bonds a group of unrelated people in much the same way that school spirit bonds the Trojan Family. But even this differentiates each sport. Baseball is special in that way. Baseball has a way of playing itself out in the most storybook way possible, and not just when there is a tragedy.
On Wednesday, two days after attending the memorial service Fernández, childhood friend and St. Louis Cardinals shortstop Aledmys Díaz hit his first career grand slam. 
Just last weekend, when the Dodgers bid farewell to long-time announcer and icon Vin Scully, the team clinched the National League West division championship on a walk-off home run from infielder Charlie Culberson. 
These miracles don’t happen as often as it may seem, or as often as we might like, but if they happened every week, they wouldn’t be as poignant.
In August, there was also the spectacular three-run home run of Cincinnati Reds reliever Michael Lorenzen, who was back on the field for the first time following the loss of his father. 
“If you’re around baseball and you’ve been here long enough, you’ll see all sorts of things that you think you’ll never see again or you thought you’d never see,” Reds manager Bryan Price said after the game to Cincinnati.com. “This falls under that heading. I never thought I would see something like that; as majestic and poetic and emotional as that moment.” 
When baseball said goodbye to future Hall of Famer and former Yankee shortstop Derek Jeter, it was at the end of a long career with many moments of great importance. But in his last game at Yankee Stadium, in his last at bat, with the game tied, Jeter had a walk-off hit to end the game. As Jeter leaped in the air with both hands extended towards the sky, it’s hard to imagine a more fitting end to such a storied career, but baseball has a way with the world like that. 
No one can predict when the next unforgettable baseball moment will happen, but it will, and if you are watching it, you’ll remember where you were, and if you aren’t a baseball fan, you’ll still hear about it.
As the magical season of October fast approaches, keep your eye on the baseball world — you never know when something is going to happen that is so beautiful, you wouldn’t even have been able to come up with it yourself.

Sitting at 1-3 and facing a torrent of criticism, The Trojans could easily feel some self-pity. After all, the program’s season seems to be hanging by a thread less than a month in, thanks to losses to three top-25 opponents — all away from home. The team’s only game in the Coliseum so far this year came against Utah State, where USC cruised to a 45-7 victory over the Aggies.
But no one was making excuses at Howard Jones Field on Wednesday, as the Trojans continued to prepare for their matchup against Arizona State this Saturday. Defensive coordinator Clancy Pendergast was disappointed in his unit’s performance last week against Utah, especially by the Utes’ 93-yard, game-winning drive late in the fourth quarter.
“Situational football was disappointing,” Pendergast said. “We let two big third downs get converted … and obviously the touchdown was disappointing. There weren’t a whole lot of good things on that drive or in many parts of that game.”
Taming the Sun Devils
After last weekend’s debacle, USC worked throughout the week to regroup defensively, especially with Arizona State’s dual-threat signal caller Manny Wilkins coming to the Coliseum. His last time out, the sophomore Sun Devil quarterback torched Cal for 362 combined yards through the air and on the ground, and he found the endzone four times — running it in thrice.
Head coach Clay Helton called containing Wilkins a “primary concern” during Wednesday’s practice.
“I’m beyond impressed by … his pocket sense, being able to create [running opportunities] off of pass attempts,” Helton said.
Arizona State can produce in the other phases of the game as well. The Sun Devils scored touchdowns off an interception and on an onside kick return against the Golden Bears, and redshirt junior safety Chris Hawkins stressed the need to be stingy on all facets of defense, including special teams.
“They scored 31 [points] in the fourth quarter, right? That’s impressive,” Hawkins said. “We have to limit them. We can’t expect our offense to score 60 points.”
Senior linebacker Michael Hutchings agreed with his teammate. The Trojans’ co-captain admitted the defense was still a work in progress, and had to continue making strides.
“The huge thing for us is being more assignment sound,” Hutchings said. “We still haven’t gotten there yet, to where everyone is really comfortable on the field and not making too many mistakes.”
Offensive Tweaks
Despite USC’s disappointing performance against Utah, Helton said he thought the loss was “by far our best game” and was happy to see the offense gaining chunks of yardage on drives.
“The problem was some of those chunks ended up being fumbles,” Helton said.
Helton remained upbeat about his squad’s progress, from star junior wide receiver JuJu Smith-Schuster to the running back corps. He praised Smith-Schuster’s performance against Utah, in which he had eight receptions for 98 yards, and said the Trojans’ improved running game gave the dynamic receiver more chances via the pass.
“When you’re running the ball for 200 yards-plus, you’re going to get man-to-man [coverage],” Helton said. “We did, and we took that opportunity.”
In the same vein, Helton looks to give senior tailback Justin Davis more touches. Helton said he wanted Davis to get the ball 20 to 25 times per game, and he also said sophomore back Ronald Jones II was “ready to explode,” as USC looks to establish a ground game.
“I love the balance of the game,” Helton said. “If I had to err, I would love to err towards the run game, as we all know.”
Injury Updates
Finally, Helton provided some updates on injured Trojans. Senior right tackle Zach Banner practiced lightly on Wednesday with an ankle issue but is expected back in practice by Thursday. Helton said freshman cornerback Jack Jones was “a lot closer” to returning than expected and could also be back on Thursday.
Redshirt junior defensive tackle Khaliel Rodgers suffered a wrist injury and sophomore running back Dominic Davis hurt his knee during Wednesday’s practice, but neither is expected to miss any time.

“This is 7.” Four months shy of the iPhone’s 10th birthday, Apple unveiled a newer, “better” model of the iPhone. The phone was released to the public Sept. 16 with many added features, such as a 12MP camera, built-in water-resistance, a brighter and more colorful display and a stereo speaker system. However, the iPhone also lost a very notable piece of hardware: the headphone socket. Users are now left with no alternative than to use Bluetooth headphones or similar wireless devices. The iPhone 7 does come with an adapter that allows the continued usage of wired headphones, but this adapter is plugged into the charging port, therefore preventing users from listening to audio and charging at the same time (unless they want to pay an extra $40 for a different adapter that allows this). At least right now, the elimination of a headphone socket seems to be more of a nuisance than an improvement. Inevitably, the general population will adapt in time and learn to accept the loss of the headphone socket. But perhaps society shouldn’t be forced to cope — especially college-age consumers, who rely so often on features within their technology. Perhaps innovation is not necessarily always symbolic of progress.
Since 2007, Apple has released a total of 15 models of the iPhone, and with each release, the company claims that the newer model is “better.” Though there are some features that indisputably make the newer models superior to their predecessors (such as a prolonged battery life) a constant claim of further achieved greatness begs the question of who gets to decide what “better” means. In a satirical website entitled Apple Plugs, Apple’s mantra of constant, unrelenting innovation and affected style is mocked through the release of a fake product: Apple Plugs (small pieces of metal that fit into the headphone port to seal off the port and prevent usage, much like the latest model of the iPhone). The words, “Just trust us. It’s better,” fill the screen at the end of the website’s presentation. This mantra, though clearly and intentionally exaggerated, seems to resonate with truth when thinking about Apple and other similar large companies. Each time these high-tech companies release a new product and boast of its improvement from the older models, society generally accepts the new product as the new standard of “the best.” This blind acceptance is what makes innovation so dangerous.
Life for tech companies can be seen as one massive race, each company pushing itself nonstop to be the first to make the next best thing. No sooner do they finish a product than they drop it and scramble to create the next one before all of their competitors. Innovation and creation are, or should be, generally channeled toward the ultimate goal of improvement of life, but perhaps the pressure to constantly find the “next best thing” forces companies to innovate for the sake of innovation. The result of this particular motivation for innovation may be a product that is new, but not necessarily improved. Change is necessary for the proper evolution of society, but the direction in which society is pushed seems to be controlled by the innovators. Yes, the consumers may have some complaints and critiques about the products, but after a period of time, these dissidents disappear into oblivion. However, with creative destruction comes the potential for destructive creation.
Society should look warily at the influence bigshot tech companies have over the progression of society; too often, “new” is equated with “better,” and “innovation” has been equated with “growth.” In the case of the loss of the headphone socket, consumers inevitably need to “make the leap” into a world of wireless technology, as The New York Times technology writer Brian X. Chen writes. 
Many economists and innovators praise wireless technology, labeling it as the next step toward a more convenient lifestyle. However, wireless technology and bluetooth devices often have a lower audio quality than wired listening devices. In making a transition to a wireless world, companies like Apple are sacrificing quality for convenience, and due to the great credibility society has given to these companies, people will inevitably follow suit and accept a wireless world as better and abandon wired, outdated technology.  Though the headphone adapter gives people a way to remain in the antiquated world of wired technology, this adapter simply causes an extra hassle that will likely cause people to resort to using the wireless technology anyway, for convenience if nothing else.
People should not be mindless drones who simply do what they are told. At times, complacency in the consumer market causes people to simply allow themselves to be susceptible to the suggestion of big companies. One should wonder what other ideas have been implanted in the minds of people by big companies, and realize just how much influence these industries are given to control the future of society.

According to Twitter, the first matchup between presidential candidates Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump was the “most tweeted debate ever.” Clicking on the debates hashtag Monday night, one could find, amid policy critiques, everything from Law & Order: SVU memes to compilations of Trump sniffing. As I switched between tabs on my laptop, going back and forth between the Huffington Post livestream and my Twitter feed, it was impossible to feel like I was watching the debate alone. The ability to instantly broadcast our reactions, however, is not an effect that only Twitter had on the debate. Liveblogging, tweeting and posting Facebook statuses give everyone the ability to fact-check in real time. While think pieces abound about how we’re living in a post-fact society and pundits lament that voters simply don’t care about facts anymore, the debate, at least, told a different story — one in which fact-checking won the day. 
Monday night, one could find fact-checking on almost every mainstream publication’s website. The New York Times, NPR, CBS and CNN all have posted fact checks of the debate. Bloomberg TV posted fact checks on-screen while airing the debate. PolitiFact tweeted out fact checks in real time. Hillary Clinton even plugged a new feature on her official campaign website during the debate — “Literally Trump” — was constantly updated with Trump quotes that contradicted what he said during the debate. In fact, after Clinton mentioned the site, almost 2 million people visited it within an hour. However, some of the most significant fact-checking didn’t come from news outlets or hired fact-checkers at all. Rather, social media provided an outlet for users to be fact checkers themselves. 
According to Twitter, the most retweeted tweet during Monday night’s debate wasn’t explicitly about the debate at all. It was a tweet from Trump in November of 2012: “The concept of global warming was created by and for the Chinese in order to make U.S. manufacturing non-competitive.” The tweet first started going viral when a Twitter user inaccurately claimed that the Trump campaign had deleted it. However, the notorious tweet, which has now been retweeted more than 95,000 times, is itself an example of the popularity of what could be considered grassroots fact-checking. 
Rather than going to The New York Times to see what the candidates are lying about or which of their positions they are misconstruing, under grassroots fact-checking, users simply share tweets that contradict what the candidate is saying. This was especially problematic for Trump during the debate. When asked about climate change, Clinton said that while she thinks it’s real, her opponent believes that it is “a hoax perpetrated by the Chinese.” Trump interrupted, repeating “I did not” several times. While it is a point of contention whether the tweet was intended to be a genuine statement of belief, Trump’s denial of ever saying this was enough to begin the retweets. However, even if one were to dismiss this single tweet as evidence of Trump’s denial of climate change, a website called Trump Twitter Archive has compiled 100 other tweets that imply that he thinks that global warming is “fake.” 
Of course, there may be evidence that people don’t care about facts anymore. And, perhaps, no Trump supporters have been dissuaded from voting for him despite these discrepancies in opinion. However, the sheer volume of fact-checking that occurred from ordinary social media users suggests that a significant portion of voters are still paying attention and are still willing to call candidates out when they are simply not telling the truth.

A woman sued a USC fraternity chapter and an event-planning company Tuesday, claiming she suffered severe head injuries when a drone that was being used to photograph attendees at the fraternity party fell last fall.
The Los Angeles Superior Court lawsuit lists Pi Kappa Phi and Perfect Event Inc. as the defendants, according to the City News Service. Alina Pituch, the woman suing both parties for negligence and premises liability, is seeking unspecified damages. USC is not a defendant in the lawsuit.
Pi Kappa Phi President Kyle Wiest said in an email to the Daily Trojan that the fraternity does not comment on pending litigation.
The lawsuit alleges that Pituch arrived at Pi Kappa Phi’s “Glow Party” at around 11 p.m. on Oct. 3, 2015. The event was held in the backyard of Pi Kappa Phi’s house. According to the suit, the fraternity hired Perfect Event Inc. to organize the party and employ the operator of the drone that took pictures of those at the event.
Pituch alleges that about 15 to 20 minutes after her arrival, a “heavy object fell on [her] head, causing her to stumble forward into a friend, who caught [her] before she fell down.” After the object struck her, Putich’s head began to bleed “vigorously” and she was taken by ambulance to a hospital, according to her court papers.
In her complaint, Pituch alleges that the object was later identified as a drone and caused her to suffer injuries to the back of her head, forehead and left eye. Pituch also claims she felt dizzy and became disoriented due to the force of the blow.
The lawsuit claims Pituch suffers from permanent scarring on her head and forehead and that her ability to focus on school work has been “compromised” due to the headaches she has been experiencing after the injury.

The Row was abuzz with partygoers shifting in and out of pulsing houses along the half-mile stretch of fraternity homes on 28th Street. As the clock inched toward 12 a.m., the Thursday night festivities were approaching their enforced conclusions.
Sophomore Katie McCool was tired. The night had been long, there was class for her in the morning and she was ready to go home. 
But as she was about to leave a party with a group of friends, she noticed a girl in the hallway struggling to stand. The girl was alone, disorientated and nearly unconscious.
“It was clear she couldn’t handle herself,” McCool said. “She was very intoxicated.”
A small crowd formed. People debated calling for help: DPS, 911, a roommate. 
“No, she’s conscious,” someone said. “She’s responsive.” 
McCool and the group eventually agreed on a happy medium; They phoned student EMTs, who, upon arrival, said she was well enough to be taken home. McCool and one of her friends tucked the girl into an Uber, eventually putting her to bed and in the care of her roommate. The girl eventually recovered, but throughout the night, she vomited, sweat through the sheets and foamed at the mouth. 
These are symptoms of alcohol poisoning, which can be a lot more serious than just a brutal hangover the next day. 
As the University continues to rise into the upper echelons of academia, a lingering challenge remains as to how to break up a stubborn binge-drinking culture that is putting students’ lives at risk not just on the Row, but all throughout the campus community.
 
A Stubborn Minority
Binge drinking, typically classified as having five or more drinks in a short period of time, has long been a staple of a college culture where students will drink to dangerous extremes. USC is no exception, and it is the leading cause of Trojans being sent from late-night parties strewn around campus straight into the local emergency room.

“When we look back at the data, we see a growing number of students who are being transported to hospitals over the past 10 years for the overconsumption of alcohol,” said Ainsley Carry, vice president for Student Affairs.
Data collected by the University since the early 2000s show that the numbers of undergraduates participating in “high-episodic” drinking — defined as the consumption of five or more drinks for males and four or more drinks for females on at least one occasion in the past two weeks  — is both above the national average and rising. According to the 2014-2015 Impact Report compiled by AlcoholEdu for the University,  nearly a third of the USC student population had binge drank within the past two weeks during the fall semester, a four percent increase from 2006.
Not surprisingly, then, a steady stream of underclassmen is being rushed to hospitals after overestimating their drinking limits. In just the first few weeks of this school year alone, there have been nearly 50 alcohol-related medical transports on and around the University Park Campus. The mass majority of those incidents have involved underage, first-year students.
It’s an issue that has severely gripped the attention of campus administrators and student groups alike. The overarching theme of their efforts is clear: stop the fringe culture of binge drinking in its tracks.
“We have a brand as a party school,” Carry said. “Some students come here and think it’s what everyone else is doing, but the truth is 90 percent of our student population manages themselves responsibly.”
From the Impact Report, of the nearly 3,000 students that arrive on campus each year, 59 percent come in as non-drinkers – meaning they haven’t had a sip of alcohol in the past two weeks, a 6 percent increase from 2006. Abstainers, or those who haven’t touched a drink in the past year, make up 29 percent of that. 
But by 45 days into the semester, that first group is down to 44 percent. The abstainers? Decreases to 24 percent. Somehow along the way, students are picking up a drinking habit, and in dangerous amounts. Binge drinking, too, jumps from 21 percent to 32 percent. 
“Alcohol use in high school students has gone down over the years, so more students are coming to us as non-drinkers,” said Paula Swinford, director for the Office of Wellness and Health Promotion. “One of our challenges is how to hold onto them.”
A Space for Non-Drinkers
For administrators, the key to maintaining these “non-drinkers” is offering programming that doesn’t center on alcohol. If the student doesn’t drink, ‘Good,’ they say. Their mission is to provide an alternative so the pressure to go out and party dissipates.
“Residents tell me they are not a huge drinker or partier, but that’s the only way to hang out with their friends in that group,” said Heather Lee, vice president of advocacy for Residential Student Government. “The idea is that partying is the primary social event, and if you don’t do that, there’s no way to hang out.
To combat these residents’ preconceived notions, the Office of Residential Education rolled out “Cardinal and Gold Events” last year, which are late-night, alcohol-alternative functions Thursdays through Saturdays. And so far, they’ve been quite the success. ResEd Director Emily Sandoval couldn’t help but smile when describing a Pinterest-themed craft event this month that had more than 200 people in attendance – on a Friday night.
“It’s nice just to know that the students who are coming out to the late-night programs — it’s for them,” she said. “It’s for students who think there’s nothing else going on on campus.”
Those Cardinal and Gold events have been supplemented this year with Late Night ’SC, programming offered to all USC students, not just residents, that also offers non-alcohol-centric events during prime social hours on Thursday, Friday and Saturday nights. And this year’s expansion of programming for student housing, or “Residential Colleges,” is envisioned as a way to provide a social community for students with events that aren’t about alcohol.
The crux of these efforts is to normalize non-drinking behavior before it starts.
When Swinford from OWHP speaks about drinking’s effects on young college students, her characteristically cheerful demeanor stiffens. Working at the University since 1987, she’s witnessed the worst possible outcome of binge drinking.
“I have lived through student deaths due to alcohol,” Swinford said. “Nobody wants that.”
For her, it’s all about education — convincing students that there are more consequences to drinking than just a nasty hangover. The neurological damage is what worries her.
Advances in brain science have shown, Swinford said, that the human brain goes through as much change between the ages of 19 and 24 as from birth until 5 years old. 
“If we are going to really provide an elite educational experience, we have to be up front how you are messing with the equipment if you’re drinking,” she said.
Swinford, of course, understands the reality. Students coming to this university will drink, as they have in the past and likely will into the foreseeable future. But in her ideal world, it’s not really about educating young students how to drink, but rather, how not to.
“I would have told you in 1987 that we could teach an 18-year-old how to drink responsibility,” she said. “What worries me now is I don’t think we can.”
Before It’s Too Late
The question remains, however, on what to do about the students they can’t save right away, the students who just can’t seem to stop indulging in dangerous drinking behavior.
“We know it will happen, so we want to find out what is the desire or the culture that pushes people to drink alcohol to the point where they’re unconscious,” Carry said.
This is Carry’s ballpark. For him and his department, it’s about providing policy and environmental changes to the campus that will help students who have drunk too much, while also empowering them with the skill development to monitor their own behavior.
In 2013, Student Affairs implemented an amnesty policy, which said if a student calls for medical help relating to underage drinking, they won’t be sanctioned. It then updated the social events policy, which hadn’t been touched much since 1992, with the realities of student behavior.
Changes included extending Thursday night events to 12 a.m. and weekend events to 2 a.m. The thought behind the change was that students were drinking faster to beat the prior deadline. With a later party, hopefully, that behavior is more drawn out.
And those free USC Ubers, rolled out in fall 2014, were about more than just getting students from one block of campus to another. With average usage sitting at roughly 13,000 rides a week, the goal is that it curbs the desire to drink and drive. Its use is not always about alcohol, but that’s all right, Carry said. If it can help during a pivotal moment, it’s working.

The Greek community has also received a renewed focus. Both the Interfraternity and Panhellenic Councils are continually working with administration to combat the dangers of underage binge drinking that can plague their social events. For example, this semester,  Panhellenic has offered chapter programming to supplement AlcoholEdu, discussing the underlying dangers and causes of binge drinking, as well as augmented partnerships with campus health and wellness organizations. 
Last semester, the Fraternity and Sorority Leadership Development updated an 11-page list of regulations for Greek-related social events. In particular, Row parties that serve alcohol must have a guest list approved 24 hours in advance, specifically mark underage drinkers, serve only beer and wine, hire a security guard for every 50 people present and limit men and women to within public areas of the party until 8 a.m. the following morning.
Questions do remain on the enforcement of such social event policies. Girls in attendance at these parties have reported the veiled inclusion of hard alcohol and the spotty screening of underage drinkers. And when partygoers’ hands are Sharpied with a black “x,” they can often be quickly wiped off or ignored by fraternity members tending bar. 
In a statement to the Daily Trojan, IFC said policy violations like these are strictly enforced by the OFSLD, the IFC judicial board and the Department of Public Safety. They stressed the many problems from binge drinking stem rather from “pregaming” Row events.
“This is an issue which we, in partnership with all other councils, are working to solve with the continued enforcement of the Event Registration guidelines and renewed commitment to wellness education,” the statement read. 
But such actions are not limited to the Row. Without such explicit restrictions, off-Row events allow an even greater access to hard alcohol and tacit approval of underage drinking. Parties lining nearby streets like Menlo Avenue and Ellendale Place too feature irregular ID checks with much less University regulation than the Greek community faces. 
These issues — both after-hours and off-campus — are far from the field of vision of campus administrators. There is the belief, then, that some responsibility must lie on the student for the spaces administrators can’t reach. The idea is that students must want to change. 
“What worries me most is that somehow or another the students look to the University to fix it. ‘You guys make us safe. What’s the university doing to keep me safe?’” Swinford said. “The University will continue to reduce risk and try to be clear about message and enforce where it can, but that, ultimately, the population will have to decide if it’s a problem.”
Making the Call 
Above all else, safety and health are the top priorities among administrators and student groups alike. The thought is that it is better for a student to get help if necessary, than end up sick and alone like the girl sophomore Katie McCool found on that unfortunate Thursday night.
“We don’t want people to feel like they shouldn’t call for help,” Carry said. “If the numbers need to continue to increase, let them increase, because we’re preventing something else much worse.”
And for those non-drinkers, empowering them from a silent majority into a University norm is ultimately what the school hopes to achieve.
“There are many ways to do USC,” Swinford said. “And intoxicated is only one of them.”

Photo courtesy of Jennifer LaGrowSet up to turn up · Tailgater Concierge, a business started by a USC alumna, provides the tailgating equipment football fans need on game day.
Tailgating is an essential and fun college experience — providing the tables and other equipment necessary to tailgate is not.
It was with this in mind that USC alumna Jennifer LaGrow and her family founded Tailgater Concierge, a hassle-free service providing set-up and breakdown of tailgating equipment on game days. Since its 2014 launch at USC, the service has spread to six other campuses, including the University of Mississippi, the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, the University of Michigan, Stanford University, Northwestern University and UCLA.
LaGrow and her husband remained season ticket-holders when they moved to Chicago in 2002. However, tailgating proved to be difficult when living out of town.
“It just wasn’t as fun,” LaGrow said. “I hosted a tailgate for a USC vs. Notre Dame game, and I was happy just to pay someone to get the tent and tailgating chairs, but it wasn’t possible. You could call for party supplies, but when you’re coming in for a weekend, it was just a total hassle. We were like, ‘Boy, someone should do this for a living.’”
Tailgater Concierge arranges exclusive space outside of the Coliseum on game days for their clients’ tailgates. The company is the exclusive tailgating partner of USC Athletics.
There are two different packages to choose from: the field goal package, designed for 10 people, and the touchdown package, designed for 11 to 20 people. Both packages include the reserved space, tents, chairs, coolers and ice. Food can be ordered or brought by the customer, as grills are also available for rental.
“Our team sets it all up for you four hours before game time and we break down at kickoff,” LaGrow said. “We just started working with USC Catering this year. You can go on their website and order from venues on campus like Seeds and Lemonade, and they’ll deliver to our tailgate area so we can give it to the customer.”
John Schneider, a Tailgater Concierge customer, expressed his love for the hospitality of the company.
“The best part of it is that I can walk away and I don’t have to schlep anything to my car,” Schneider said. “The convenience of walking to the game at the end, not worrying about the equipment, is the best part of it all. Jennie and her family just know what they’re doing.”
LaGrow graduated from USC in 1988 with an bachelor’s in business administration and in 1992 with a masters of business administration. Her husband also graduated from USC 1988, her daughter graduated in 2014 and her son will graduate in 2018. LaGrow’s children play a great role in the management and execution of the service on game day.
“On game day, they are the team leaders,” LaGrow said. “Last year we were still living in Chicago, so my daughter was the team leader for both USC and UCLA. She would be playing hostess all day long.”
LaGrow expressed her wishes of creating a business that her children could eventually take over.
“My goal would be someday to be able to pass this on,” LaGrow said. “My daughter, a Marshall graduate, [has told me], ‘In two years, I want to be able to come run Tailgater with you.’ That’s my vision, to create a legacy for the rest of the Trojans in my family.”
Though the company has already seen many repeat customers, social media will play a big role in the company’s future marketing strategy, as its main challenge currently is making the tailgating service well-known. LaGrow mentioned how it’s a new category and service that people are not conditioned to look for.
“Our biggest struggle right now is to let people know that this exists,” LaGrow said. “Once they do, they’re like ‘Oh my god, this is the best thing ever.’”

Napa Aramthanapon | Daily TrojanPower to the people · USG Senators considered an amendment to the bylaws during Tuesday’s meeting at the Ronald Tutor Campus Center.
The Undergraduate Student Government Senate voted to give students the power to pass referendums at the weekly Senate meeting Tuesday night.
Senator Daniel Newman proposed two amendments to the referendum proposal, which had been introduced by Senator Sabrina Enriquez two weeks prior.
By the original language of Enriquez’s proposal, any referendum must be approved by USG’s Judicial Council, bear signatures from 10 percent of the undergraduate student body, be affirmed by two-thirds of the Senate, and be passed by a majority vote of students.
Newman suggested establishing a threshold that referendums must be voted on by at least 25 percent of the student body to be passed, due to concerns that low voter turnout could result in a referendum being passed by an insignificant fraction of students.
Enriquez responded that worries over low voter turnout were unfounded, given that there is no threshold in place for general USG elections, though USG wields an immense amount of control over student policies.
“The concern was, ‘What if two people in the entire University voted on it? Should they be able to make the decision?’” Enriquez said. “To that, I would say that if two people were also the only two people to vote on every Senator and President and Vice President of USG who later appoint so much staff, which in all amounts to 2.56 million of student fees, then we have a much greater issue on our hands.”
Senator Paul Samaha also raised concerns that the amendment would establish too high of a barrier to passing referendums, given that voter turnout has declined to near 30 percent in recent years.
The Senate ultimately voted to pass the referendum proposal without the suggested amendments.
Senators Tingyee Chang and Daniel Million, who had not been allowed to participate in last week’s Senate meeting as a consequence of failing to pass a parliamentary procedure test, expressed concerns that they had been disenfranchised without due process. To address those grievances, Senators decided to allow one retake, after which a Senator who did not pass would have to meet with the USG Parliamentarian.
