The USC faculty member fatally stabbed Friday has been identified by the University as Bosco Tjan, a professor of psychology.
In a letter sent out to the campus community, USC President C. L. Max Nikias mourned Tjans’ loss while also commending the quick response of the Department of Public Safety and the on-scene university counselors.
The letter stated that on Monday, Dean of Religious Life Varun Soni will hold a gathering for the campus community to come together “…for reflection and prayer.”
The president encouraged those in need of support to contact Student Counseling Services or the Center for Work and Family Life.
Tjan has worked at the University since 2001 when he arrived as an assistant professor. He was also the co-director of the Dornsife Cognitive Neuroscience Imaging Center, which he helped found in 2005.
The Department of Public Safety  responded at 4:35 pm Friday on the 3600 block of McClintock Avenue to a call of the stabbing. When they arrived on the scene, Tjan was unresponsive. The suspect was described as male, white with lacerations to his palms.

As my semester abroad comes to an end and finals are around the corner, I am sad to be saying farewell to Morocco, which has challenged me, comforted me, mesmerized me, and most importantly, helped me grow as an individual. 
Here are some of my favorite memories and moments that I’ll miss:
Zelij 
This intricate type of mosaic tile-work features Islamic geometric patterns and is specific to Morocco.
Street Art
I’ve seen murals in almost every city I’ve visited. The art scene here is so rich and beautiful.
Mint Tea 
Sometimes I drink it up to three times a day. You can add vervain, citron, and other herbs to the tea, always served hot and poured to create bubbles.
Ceramics
You can find hand-crafted tagines, bowls, cups, plates, all glazed and painted in beautiful shades anywhere. One time, I stopped on the side of the road and found this little ceramic shops and got mini tagines for 10 dirhams, about $1 each.
Couscous
This is the real, OG couscous. It’s small grained, fluffy, and only eaten on Fridays. Hands down my favorite Moroccan meal.
Amazing Landscapes
A lot of people think Morocco is all desert, but it’s actually home to beautiful falls, lush forests, and natural caves.
Athaan
As any dominantly Muslim country, the call to prayer is beautifully recited five times a day. You can hear it across the city, as people stop what they’re doing and go to the mosque to pray. It shows how people make time for God everyday.
Moroccan Couches
I’ll never forget these extremely comfortable, ornate couches, which can double as beds. They are the center of a Moroccan house and determine the theme of the living room.
Host Family
I have been living with them for the past four months and have never felt more loved. The are the epitome of Moroccan hospitality and helped me with my Arabic and Darija immensely. I will miss them dearly.
The Price of Living
The conversion rate from dollars to dirhams is really low, so you get more dirhams for your dollar. My average lunch (salad and an entree) would cost about 15-30 dirhams, which is about $1.50 to $3. Living in Europe way more expensive than in Morocco, that’s why I stuck to traveling to Europe instead.
Famideast
A term coined that combines “family” with “Amideast,” the name of our program. These are the people I’ve had intellectual conversations with, traveled with, they’ve seen me in my best and worst states, and I’ve created friendships that I’ll hold on to for the rest of my life. Traveling really does test friendships and you find yourself crossing boundaries that you’d never imagine yourself crossing.
Being Immersed in Arabic and Darija
All of my daily interactions in my home and on the streets are in Arabic or Darija (the Moroccan colloquial tongue), I watch TV in Arabic, listen to Arabic music, etc. Living in a country that speaks your target language is the best way to truly learn and improve and it makes the learning process much easier.
Medinas and Souqs
You can find anything from fake Yeezy’s to organic argan oil here. I have never had a dull moment in the souq; the immersion of various sights, smells, people are all part of the shopping experience. What’s fascinating is every Medina is unique to each city. In Essaouira, a small beach town, the Medina has wide streets and many seafood stalls. Fes has the largest Medina and extremely narrow alleyways, used as a protection mechanism to confuse invaders.
Traveling proximity and weekend trips
My roommate is currently in London for the weekend after she found a $50 round trip plane ticket online. I’m going to Spain via a 30 minute ferry ride next weekend. Traveling is so easy in this side of the world–Europe is just an hour plane ride away and traveling within Europe is a piece of cake when everything is so close and the modern transportation system is very convenient. 
Wherever I am, I will always hold my experience in Morocco dearly, and know that I will be back here sometime in the future. 
I highly recommend anyone interested in studying abroad in the MENA region to consider doing the same program I did. Amideast sets you up with all the tools you need to make your cultural and academic experience the best it can be.

I just came back from 3 weeks in Morocco [after 4 weeks in Ethiopia.].  I also saw so many great things in Morocco, from the mosaics to the sand dunes to incredibly warm and wonderful people.  I too highly recommend it for all ages.  I am just wondering where you found to eat at such low prices, everywhere I went lunch prices were 120 – 180 Dh.

A man wielding a fire extinguisher sprayed students and damaged property in Doheny Library Friday evening before being taken into custody by police.
The event is not related to a fatal stabbing on campus only an hour and a half prior.
According to the LAPD dispatch, officers responded to reports of a man moving through the library with the extinguisher just before 6 p.m. DPS evacuated the library and apprehended the suspect shortly thereafter. At least three victims were treated for breathing complications resulting from the extinguisher. 
A USC alumna, who asked that her name not be used to protect her privacy, said she was studying on the bottom floor of the library when she saw white powder appearing out of the corner of her eye. When she looked up, a man dressed in black sprayed her in the face with the extinguisher. She described him as looking “completely calm,” and said she was thankful that he had not been armed. 
“I ran up the stairs and was screaming for someone to call 911,” the alumna said. “It got all blurry and I was waiting to get hit by a bullet – but I’m so thankful to be alive right now.” 
The witness said that she had seen the same male about 30 minutes earlier, walking around outside the library and flipping benches over. She said he had appeared calm throughout.

A USC psychology professor was fatally stabbed on campus by a student Friday evening and the suspect has been taken into custody, authorities said.
The Department of Public Safety  responded at 4:35 pm on the 3600 block of McClintock Avenue to a call of the stabbing.
The suspect was described as male, white with lacerations to his palms.  The victim was pronounced dead on the scene. The victim has been identified as Bosco Tjan.
The Los Angeles Police Department is currently conducting the investigation, and they do not yet have a motive but believe it was not a random act. The suspect reportedly offered no resistance.
A Trojan alert was released shortly after the incident, telling students to stay away from the Seeley G. Mudd building and that there was “No danger to USC or the USC community.”
USC has an abundance of great qualities, but I have to think that safety concerns discourage some applicants.
Could you explain how a freak occurance like this connects with you pre existing safe concerns? This event was an outlier. UCLA is surrounded by Brentwood and Beverly Hills and Bel Air and considered a very safe campus yet they had a student-teacher murder too this year. 
I just don’t see how your comment trlses to this.article bits almost like a non-sequitur.
