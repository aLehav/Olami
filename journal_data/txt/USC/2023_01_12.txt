Every year, Taco Bell employees have the opportunity to bring ideas to stakeholders and partners in the company’s Internal Incubator, where a panel of judges evaluates each business plan and selects one to implement. On September 29th, 2022, two USC students joined the panel for the Internal Incubator. 
Zach Trail, manager and co-creative director of the program, explained that the idea for the Incubator came from Taco Bell’s CEO, Mark King. 
“He came to us saying, ‘Hey, I want this spirit of restless creativity. How do we make things bigger and better with new ideas, and how can they come from any person at any level? I want this program to get people to challenge themselves to be more creative, think more creative, and give them a formal process to bring their ideas to life.” 
The first Internal Incubator launched in 2021, and since then, four more sessions have been launched, each highlighting a different area to tackle. In the fifth session, the Internal Incubator transformed into an immersive experience, with the goal of developing ideas on how to make working at Taco Bell a “fantastic place.” Team members were flown into Huntington Beach for the two-day off-site session. 
Team members engaged in creative exercises that led to the ideation of ideas. After 70 ideas were created, the session was extended to a final day of presentations where they were narrowed down to a top four. 
As the four teams pitched their ideas, USC students Russell Agustin and Tiana Day joined the experience as judges alongside world-renowned professionals including Tess Melody Taylor, Fernando Claussen, Tim Bergevin and Mike Grams. Judges were asked to provide insights on the business plans that were presented, in terms of enhancing the social impacts that Taco Bell can have on their own employees across the country and worldwide.
“My participation in the Incubator gave me a lot of hope in terms of seeing industry giants change their actions and branding themselves in the context of social good,” said Agustin, a junior majoring in public policy and minoring in social entrepreneurship. “Just seeing them undergo this process and seeing them listen to employees at their own corporation I think was a beautiful thing.”
Agustin explained that he has worked on looking at current systems and practicing creative curiosity in examining ways to change and improve processes.
“My time at USC has taught me that things can always be better, despite the fact that they are really effective or efficient as they are,” Agustin said. “A lot of people are bought into the fact that a process is the best that it could possibly be. But I think what I was able to translate from these programs is looking at something and being like, ‘You know what, this is a good idea, but it could be better.’”
Day, a sophomore majoring in arts, technology and the business of innovation, said she believes the impact of the Incubator stretches far beyond Taco Bell. 
“Our generation is changing the game,” Day said. “And a lot of these corporations who have been in the game for a really long time are finally listening to young people and giving them a space at the table, because I believe this is our future that we’re fighting for.”
Trail noted that employees who participate also have the opportunity to gain something new from the experience. 
“You leave with tangible, new tools that you can take back into your roles and people leave feeling creative,” he said, “even though they might not think they are.”
Correction: This article was updated at 10:27 a.m. on Jan. 12 to reflect that Taco Bell’s CEO is Mark King, not Mark Kane, as a previous version stated. The Daily Trojan regrets this error.

When Eric Guo attended orientation over the summer he encountered a serious issue: Orientation housing was overbooked and he had nowhere to stay. This led to him and other students sleeping in the University library. The second night, however, an upperclassman offered to let Guo spend the night at his apartment. That night was important for two reasons: Guo realized the issue housing posed to students across the country and he made one of his first university friends.
Launched June 14, Microsleep is a nonprofit organization that aims to help students find “safe, affordable and convenient housing.” The service helps low income and first generation students find temporary housing at highly populated universities — such as USC — where upperclassmen are not guaranteed university housing. Participating universities include USC, University of California San Diego, University of California, Berkeley and the University of Maryland.
Identical twins David Guo — a freshman majoring in computer science — and Eric Guo — a freshman at UMD also majoring in computer science — founded Microsleep to offer temporary housing solutions to students. The organization combats student homelessness by connecting temporarily unhoused students with hosts willing to take them in for a short period of time.
“Let’s say a student has been out studying late at 3 a.m. and they feel like it’s dangerous to commute back to their apartment,” Eric said. “They can use Microsleep to find a temporary housing place to stay for a single night.”
What started as friends offering each other housing in order to cut costs of operations has grown into a network spanning multiple universities. The biggest challenge in this process was creating a trusting relationship between hosts and guests to create a safe environment. While the service has not implemented a rating system for hosts or guests, it offers a feature that allows users to record malicious activity. 
Adrian Becerra, a senior majoring in computer science games, first heard of Microsleep when one of his mentees as a spring admit ambassador — David Guo — approached him asking for advice on a project he was working on. While Becerra has yet to use the service, he sees the importance of it.
“Everyone assumes that if you need to get home late at night, [you] can just take the free Lyft,” Becerra said. “What if you need to get home later in the night past 2 a.m.? Because I’ve definitely had those nights where I spent all night in the library and it’s 6 a.m., 5 a.m. and I need to get back to my dorm.”
In the future, the siblings want to expand Microsleep to service community colleges. These institutions present a new challenge because they typically do not offer housing, making a service such as Microsleep more important.
“There’s a lot of international students that actually start their educational career in community colleges,” Eric said. “However, they don’t have any housing arrangements here. They often find difficulty in finding housing in the U.S.”
The service not only offers a safe space for users to rest, but it also offers them the opportunity to meet new people and create connections between host and guest. Eric recalls a time towards the beginning of the school year when a pair of users were roommates for three days using Microsleep and then became best friends.
“Seeing the connections and the compassion that people have for each other is something that’s also very rewarding,” Eric said.
Ultimately, the pair wants to eliminate the worry of not having housing for all students. While it may be often taken for granted, many students face issues finding housing. According to Eric, closing the gap between high and low income students begins with equitable housing for all.
“A lot of people from different backgrounds struggle quietly, often going unnoticed,” David said. “Look out for your peers and, if possible, share a bed or couch. Compassion is something everyone can afford.”

Content warning: This article contains mentions of sexual assault.
I realize that my column is called “Comic Relief,” but this installment will be neither comical nor relieving. And Bill Cosby is to blame. 
Cosby, who was convicted of three accounts of aggravated indecent assault in 2018, announced plans to tour this year during an interview last month. Cosby was sentenced to three years in jail, but was released in 2021. His sentence was ended and charges dropped due to a violation of his rights during the trial. 
In 2022, a civil jury in Los Angeles found that he sexually abused a minor. During the height of the #MeToo movement, 60 women came forward with accusations about Cosby’s behavior. Last month, a few weeks prior to the tour announcement, five women filed a lawsuit against Cosby. 
All this is to say he is not in clear water and will never be. The 85-year-old will likely find himself in civil courts for the rest of his life.  
Still, that did not stop Cosby from revealing his comeback plans during a radio interview with Scott Spears, a man who described Cosby as “legendary.” 
In the interview, Cosby said he wants to perform and “​​be the Bill Cosby that my audience knows me to be.” 
At one point in time, Cosby was described as “America’s Dad.” Cosby was (formerly) most known for his starring role as Dr. Heathcliff Huxtable in “The Cosby Show,” one of the most popular shows of the 1980s. The sitcom focused on a lovable family while sharing important life lessons with its viewers. Any sweet messaging in the show has been understandably tainted. 
While Cosby was once beloved, it’s clear the general consensus is not so positive. Although Cosby’s publicist claims there is “high demand” for Cosby content, is there really? It would be easy to say obviously not — not only was he accused, but he was also convicted. Still, that doesn’t seem to actually deter powerful men from achieving the comeback they so desire.
Roman Polanski, who literally fled the United States after pleading guilty to sexually abusing a minor over 40 years ago, has a new movie set to come out this year.
In the world of comedy, the first person to come to mind is Louis C.K. Five women came forward with accusations of sexual misconduct against C.K. in 2017. C.K. corroborated all five of their stories shortly after the allegations came to light. 
Just five short years later, he won a GRAMMY for best comedy album for his special “Sincerely Louis C.K.” at the 64th Annual Grammy Awards held in 2022. He’s seeing levels of success most comedians could only ever dream of. Did the people of the Academy simply forget or do they just not care? Or was the special, which, yes, included jokes about the allegations, so very hilarious that the victims’ trauma just couldn’t compare? It’s also important to remember his mockery of school shooting victims in 2018, just a year after the misconduct came to light. 
He is on tour through the end of January. Ten out of the twelve shows scheduled are sold out. 
Saying this isn’t meant to equate Cosby and C.K. No case of assault can ever be compared as each person’s trauma is different. 
While Cosby’s publicist told NPR the tour will likely happen in spring or summer, I guess only time will tell if the tour actually comes to fruition. Even if he does go through with his plans, there’s no way to tell what his plans are. Will he go for a stadium tour or start in small venues? Will he try to defend himself or ignore the situation? Will people be there?
Ultimately, just the mere possibility that Cosby could go on tour serves as a sickening reminder that the United States legal system consistently fails victims of sexual assault. Although, after it was discovered most of the allegations of Cosby were past the statue of limitations, California ended all statue of limitations for cases of sexual assault. Thanks to the work of brave survivors, changes are happening.

In 2016, Watts native Jason Jamal Jackson was sentenced to 20 years in a Texan prison on nonviolent drug charges. Jackson, better known as 03 Greedo, is a successful rapper that was imprisoned after the release of his highly-reputable album “purple summer.” 
Though incarcerated for seven years, 03 Greedo and his team made it a priority to keep his newborn career alive. Releasing classic albums such as “The Wolf of Grape Street” in 2018 and “Still Summer in the Projects” in 2019 kept 03 Greedo relevant in the underground Los Angeles rap scene. In fact, the success of “Still Summer in the Projects”’ created a sense of legendary status when it came to 03 Greedo’s career. It’s been three years since 03 Greedo released his latest project. For this reason, “Free 03” comes as a surprise to fans hoping to meet their high expectations. After successfully arguing in court that the stop and seizure made by a police officer at the time of Greedos arrest were illegal, 03 Greedo makes his return home on January 12th being let out on parole. Anyone who likes rap will benefit from listening to Greedo’s comeback. 
“Free 03” reclaims the chokehold that 03 Greedo had on the underground L.A. rap scene. The album, which was exceptionally produced by Mike Free, reminds all those who listen how truly talented 03 Greedo is. This 14-track album establishes that 03 Greedo has surpassed the limits of a typical L.A. underground rapper and graduated to the label of another legendary West Coast rapper. 
03 Greedo crafted the perfect album by using his classic melodic style flow and pairing it with the almost harsh-sounding rap style of native L.A. rappers such as Ohgeesy, BlueBucksClan and Drakeo the Ruler. This pairing, when combined with the classic West-coast house party style of beats, creates an album in which 12 out of the 14 tracks have a heavy replay value. 
“Free 03” begins with the classic intro used by many rappers who release projects when behind bars: the prison phone call. Although done by many, 03 makes this common intro unique by paying his respects to rappers who have passed away during his time in prison. The list includes Drakeo the Ruler, Nipsey Hussle, PnB Rock, Takeoff and a few others. This list is followed by his coming home announcement, making it evident he plans to use this album as a method to celebrate his return. 
That being said, Greedo made it easy to celebrate. Track two, “Took a little minute,” sets the tone for the rest of the album. The song serves as a reminder to all those who doubted 03 can rap. This track, apart from being the first song the audience is introduced to, showcases Greedo’s lyricism and his rapping ability. The flow and the bars of the song allow the audience to feel like they’re in a high-speed chase going 100 down the 10 Freeway. “Took a little minute” is by far the best track on “Free 03.” 
However, track six is a close second. “Pourin,” which features BlueBucksClan, is the epitome of walking into a house party in the middle of South Central on a Friday night. The almost whining flow of 03 pairs perfectly with the rugged sound of BlueBucksClan. Apart from that, the Los Angeles native rap duo enters the song in a way that almost catches the listener off guard without disrupting the flow of the track. “Pourin” is the perfect example of why people should celebrate 03 Greedo’s freedom. 
Another near-perfect track off “Free 03” comes with track five. “I Don’t Mean” is a song that makes you bob your head like your neck deep in a bucket of water searching for apples. The beat, which isn’t drowned in bass and drums like West Coast rap typically is, showcases Greedo’s melodic style. “I Don’t Mean” is short and sweet, making it perfect for replay value. 
If you’re from L.A. you’d understand why “No Free Features” is a tear-jerker. “No Free Features” features Drakeo the Ruler, the late rapper who climbed the ranks with 03 throughout his time in prison. In other words, Drakeo the Ruler and 03 Greedo can be described as the Batman and Superman of the L.A. underground rap scene. Although their styles are different, they both respected each other and frequently featured on tracks together. The thought of this possibly being the last time we hear the two on the same track together brings tears to any rap aficionado’s eyes. 
No albums are perfect; “Today” is one of the only flaws that come along with “Free 03.” The track features an almost suspenseful, Halloween-themed beat. Despite its release two months after the holiday, the beat is not the song’s Achilles heel. 03’s flow is not paired smoothly with the song’s tempo, and there are times when Greedo’s word choice falls short of the anticipated beat drop. Despite all this, the track isn’t terrible, it is simply subpar when compared to the rest of “Free 03.” 
Overall, 2023 starts off with a bang for rap fans. With 03 Greedo’s prison release date being later this week, one can only expect more music and more collaborations with BlueBucksClan.

Content warning: This article contains references to mental illness.
Every few days (when I feel like bathing) I sit in the bathtub and stare at the water as I pluck out the strands of hair that need to go. As I run my fingers through my curls, my mind wanders. On special days I might feel thankful to the strands for serving my head, on shitty ones I might resent them for leaving, but mostly I just dissociate as the water glares at me and I glare back. 
Before bed I hop on my counter and take a peek at my local blackheads. It is an incredible form of dopamine — a business that I’ve managed to loop many of my friends into. I locate them, they pop em’ — it’s the pinnacle of friendship. Together, we address questions of access. 
There is also a huge learning curve — of course. I usually have to urge them to be a little more assertive and dig deeper. My blackheads are as strong as God and this sure as hell ain’t my first rodeo. 
But seriously, now that I am home in suburban Texas for the holidays, glued to my couch, I am proud to be tapping into every single dysfunctional version of myself. I’m popping in for a quick chat, accepting free samples and providing only slightly filtered life updates to past Arjuns. Like Arjun who was extraordinarily obsessed with kitchen and pantry organization (age 10) and my slightly unhinged student body president era (age 17).  I’ll never forget the visceral panic that struck through my friend Valentina and I’s veins as we realized MHS Student Council had forgotten the god-damn Chick-fil-A sauce for senior sunset. A mob of hungry Texans approached as we sank in despair. 
As I experience a taste of introspection reflecting back on all the various Arjuns that formed in this house, I don’t want to become too entrenched in reality. Not to fear, I’ve found the perfect solution: consuming hordes of questionable content, fueling the disassociation. 
From “The White Lotus” to “Dance Moms” compilations, let’s just say it’s been more white people than I’ve anticipated. I’ve also watched Mindy Kaling’s new show, “The Sex Lives of College Girls,” which perplexes me as it normalizes porn, but then again, porn is everywhere. A hard reality to grapple with, but a real one – as reality often is. 
Speaking of real, I’m also battling the realest of battles: the urge to eat a Sonic pretzel stick for lunch every day. Not to forget, the pretzel sticks have made my car awfully crummy, and to be honest — I don’t feel like cleaning it. After a certain number of cherry limeades, you kind of just want to sink into the maraschino cherry and become it. 
When (if) I finally clean it, I’m excited about the dopamine rush as the vacuum inhales the gummy bears lost in the storm that is my car. However, I fear that it’s a ways away to get there; now that I’ve overexposed myself to just about every form of dopamine, my interest in standing up is more minimal than ever. 
Most of all, it is an active challenge to share space with my family and remain friendly. The only way I can communicate with my business-bro-brother is by speaking in “Shark Tank” pitches which feels like speaking in tongues but 50 times worse. It’s not like the Scrub Daddy sponge runs through my veins every moment of the day. It’s not like I get aroused at the store when I see it. 
My dad and I tend to part ways pretty quickly when we indulge in controversial, or even just civil, conversations. It usually ends with a reminder from him, that everything in the world is shit, so I might as well embrace capitalism and become a CS major. It seems he’s projecting his unfulfilled dreams, and while I can’t follow them for him, I can mourn my unfulfilled dreams alongside him. 
In the chaos of all this dysfunction, I’m accepting the fact that there are dreams my inner child has left unfulfilled. As a kid, I dreamt about decorating the Christmas tree as a family, even though I, alone, had enough bat-shit energy about the decorations to sustain a whole small Mormon country. The color theme, the garlands, the centerpieces  — Christmas felt like everything mattered, probably because I dreamt of being a part of a white, functional, loving family. Let’s just say the pieces of the puzzle didn’t quite fit. 
Nonetheless, with the guidance of slightly unhinged white women on YouTube (thanks Rebecca Robeson), our non-religious family shared the love of Jesus. It was a beautiful touch to our atheist-Hindu household. 
Unfortunately, this year, our home went undecorated because my inner child ran out of juice. Or rather, ordering myself Christmas gifts off the Urban Outfitters clearance section seemed far more alluring than my past wishes of hustling and bustlin’ to wrap everyone’s presents alone in my bedroom. 
I forgive myself for no longer wanting to be the domestic glue of the family, and I empathize with women, as they are too often forced to perform domesticity. This shit is exhausting, fr.
I can’t stop thinking about Aubrey Plaza referring to the stroke she had as “kind of a freak thing,” and yet, I get it. I resonate with her wording, especially because I also feel like kind of a freak thing. 
I want to remind the version of myself who somehow slithered my way into a world where things feel awfully real that my heart will always be where it belongs in the foggy midst of inescapable dysfunction. 
I’m proud to no longer be performing Christianity or wishing to be a part of another family. I’m perfectly content dazing at my dad waking up my mom with a six-inch rat we’ve collected in our garage. Rumor on the street is that those rats are building a whole rat community and our home coordinates are the exact epicenter. 
Other things I’d like to get off my chest at this time: I lost my retainer. Again. I’ve been thinking about my relationship with Martha Stewart lately. I know she has a conviction of conspiracy and she’s like a mega-capitalist but she was my hero as a child, and I was cute back then. What I liked about Martha was that she had an answer for everything, even if it was just buying her products. Slay queen! Take my mom’s money!
I keep thinking about how I want to meal prep but refuse to touch salmon. Recently, I touched chicken though, and she and I got really comfortable. 
If I chicken out of making the salmon, I’m thinking I’ll still be nice to myself. After all, my recipe for success isn’t just Bella Hadid’s pasta recipe, it’s Bella Hadid’s pasta recipe with a sprinkle of self-love. And a boatload of parmesan.

If you are anything like the typical university student, you — much like me — spent the majority of winter break catching up on some much-needed rest, eating food you finally did not have to purchase and scrolling endlessly through social media. I found myself doing the latter option much longer than I intended to, and through all that scrolling, there seemed to be one woman I could not escape.
You might have heard her name, Alix Earle. Most known on TikTok for posting Get-Ready-With-Me videos while discussing her love life, nights out and experiences as a student at the University of Miami, Earle’s following surged to nearly 3.7 million followers in just a few short weeks, gaining, on average, 95,394 followers daily. This insurgence of followers caused countless dissections of her social media strategy and her rise to fame to be spread widely on the internet. People can’t seem to crack the code. How did she reach this level of success in such a short time?
Well, the answer is simple: white mediocrity.
White mediocrity is a problem that existed long before Alix Earle and has since taken on many forms. Examples of it stem further than social media; from politicians to comedians, white people are born with a specific privilege in the ability to be mediocre and fail upwards without fear. 
Ijeoma Oluo, speaker and author of “Mediocre: The Dangerous Legacy of White Male Power,” writes, “I am not arguing that every white man is mediocre … What I’m saying is that white male mediocrity is a baseline.” The truth in this statement is all around us. People of color must be the most intelligent, or even the most engaging to be held in the same regard as white, and often male, peers. Growing up in predominantly white spaces taught me that being good was not good enough. I had to be one of, if not the best. C’s were intolerable, B’s were barely scraping by, and A’s were the ticket. It is no secret to any person of color that to get half of what white people receive; we must work twice as hard.
Outside of academia, white mediocrity dominates the art and entertainment sphere. The Golden Globes is a blatant example of this. The Golden Globe Awards, created by the Hollywood Foreign Press Association, claim to celebrate the year’s best films and television shows. Yet, this same HFPA faced backlash as the Los Angeles Times revealed that of their 87 members, no one was Black, nor had a Black member been inducted in nearly two decades. So, it was no surprise that the 2021 Golden Globe nominations mirrored the stark differences in standards regarding people of color versus white media and actors. From nominations like “Emily in Paris” to James Corden — yes, late night television host James Corden — the Golden Globes proved that people of color must excel even to be considered for a Golden Globe nomination while the bar for “greatness” for media focused on white people and subject matter is much lower.
If you’re still looking for more examples of white mediocrity, take another look at social media. Axel Webber, most known for taking to social media after being rejected from his dream school, Juilliard, rose to fame in early 2022. It took a matter of days for new — yet die-hard fans — to flood Juilliard’s comments on nearly every social media platform, demanding Webber’s rejection be recanted and reconsidered. However, it took hours to discover that Webber had little to no prior acting experience when he auditioned for the prestigious university. Yet, Webber now has a modeling contract and over 4.4 million followers on TikTok alone. 
This example is not to say that Webber is undeserving of his success or untalented; however, it is to point out that white mediocrity is constantly rewarded. A simple TikTok rant about not getting into a school you had no qualifications for had turned into an opportunity of a lifetime for many with little to no work. You won’t see those like me getting that kind of treatment.
Being mediocre is not a bad thing; everyone is average at something. I’m nearly twenty years old and still need to count my fingers to solve basic math problems. The issue is not in mediocrity itself but in the system. White mediocrity is treated as extraordinary; meanwhile, the extraordinary acts of people of color are treated as mediocre. My argument against white mediocrity is not a closed fist; instead, it is an open hand to recognize its impact on people of color in various spaces. Wouldn’t it be nice to use your mediocrity to truly do something extraordinary and help those around you?

In 1923, soon after returning from France and World War I, Walt Disney founded his famous animation studio with his brother Roy in Los Angeles. In the decades following, their company — once confined to the space of their uncle’s garage — has grown into the cultural leviathan today known as The Walt Disney Company. 
A century after the founding of the animation juggernaut, an exhibition at The Huntington seeks to explore the complex position of Disney in art history. The unmistakable aesthetic of their classic animated films and theme parks has grown (in part) from a predilection of 18th century European style. Originally curated by Wolf Burchard for the Metropolitan Museum of Art, “Inspiring Walt Disney: The Animation of French Decorative Arts” displays Disney animation pieces in concert with around 50 pieces of European decorative art, largely from the 18th century.
The exhibition features three Disney films: “Cinderella” (1950), “Sleeping Beauty” (1959), and “Beauty and the Beast” (1991), in addition to snapshots from shorter animations and the theme parks. Spanning wide chronological and stylistic ranges, this constellation of exciting art demonstrates the breadth of European influence on the Disney aesthetic. 
The first two movies, “Cinderella” and “Sleeping Beauty,” come from the 1950s, a formative decade for Disney. Together, these films introduce important aspects of the animation process, while also highlighting studio artists such as the trailblazing Mary Blair. Working in a profession that, even today, is severely male-dominated, Blair broke barriers while creating iconic concept art for the studio. Famous for her striking use of color, Blair’s work garnered the attention and favor of Walt Disney and even earned comparisons with Henri Matisse.
A highlight of the exhibition is a collection of 24 hand-drawn images, together constituting the rags-to-riches transformation from “Cinderella.” Thousands of sparkles shimmer throughout the images, requiring extreme precision from the animators. The 24 frames (lasting only a second in the animation) demonstrate the detail-oriented work of Disney’s artists, even in face of the laboriousness of the work. 
The exhibition’s coverage of “Beauty and the Beast” is the most expansive, and indeed, the most compelling. The film’s aesthetic harkens back to the Late Baroque/Rococo style, known for its elaborate ornamentation, asymmetrical forms and exaltation of motion. The Beast’s Castle in many ways epitomizes these forms, bearing a strong resemblance to many pieces of French architecture from this period. As Cogsworth charmingly notes during Belle’s tour of the castle: “If it’s not Baroque, don’t fix it.”
The Rococo ingredients of the film extend beyond the setting, expressed even in the portrayal of some characters. The anthropomorphic obsessions of 18th century France have clear influences on the servants of the castle, as they were enchanted into household objects. Designs for these characters are compared to corresponding pieces of decorative art: Cogsworth is accompanied by lavishly decorated clocks; Mrs. Potts and Chip are shown with richly detailed (and occasionally zoomorphic) porcelain teapots; and Lumiere stands among twisting, asymmetric candlesticks. The connections are readily apparent and endlessly captivating. 
The poster children of “Inspiring Walt Disney” are undoubtedly the four Sèvres “Tower vases” — a pink pair from The Huntington’s collection and a green pair on loan from the Met. These intricately bedizened pieces of porcelain, replete with meticulous architectural detail and painted decoration, invoke the fairytale-like qualities manifested in Disneyland. Surrounded by concept art and schematic plans of “The Happiest Place on Earth,” visitors can clearly delineate the influence of Rococo decorative art on the design of the theme park.
Displaying art with such mass public appeal, “Inspiring Walt Disney’’ is designed to reach new audiences. The immersive installation constructed in the Huntington’s Boone Gallery leans into the fantasy and whimsy of the art on display. 
“We’ve got music playing… we’ve got the lights really low, we’ve got the dramatic spotlighting, and we’ve got these large murals that were produced from Disney background paintings for movies,” said Dr. Melinda McCurdy, the curator of British Art at The Huntington. “So we really did work to sort of create this immersive experience, which is – maybe it’s a little Disneylandish.”
The whimsical, imagination-inducing elements of this exhibition present European decorative art in a wholly new light. “Inspiring Walt Disney” presents an entryway into appreciating a set of artistic forms and styles that might otherwise seem to lack popular appeal. 
“To really get people interested in historical art, they have to have a way in. And I think things like this are a way in,” McCurdy said. 
“Inspiring Walt Disney” will remain at The Huntington until March 27. Admission is discounted for students with a valid ID (or alternatively, a College Card can be purchased that allocates free admission for a year). Do not miss this unique opportunity to broaden your artistic appreciation to broaden your appreciation of Disney’s art — and the European styles lying just behind.

After a season in which USC let up 29.5 points per game and ended in a 46-45 Cotton Bowl loss to Tulane, Head Coach Lincoln Riley announced that Defensive Coordinator Alex Grinch will remain on staff. 
“I’ve been through it enough with [Grinch] to know, don’t bet against him,” Riley said in an interview with the Los Angeles Times. “I know what’s going to happen defensively, and so I just have a confidence and a belief there, not just in Alex, but the other guys in the room.”
Rumors had swirled around the future of USC’s defensive staff, with many fans calling for a change at defensive coordinator. The loss against Tulane served as a national spotlight on USC’s subpar defense as the Trojans squandered a 15-point lead in the final 4:30 of play.
“We need to be better as coaches, we need to be better as players,” Riley said. “We need to own the things we did well, we need to own and fix the things we didn’t do well.” 
One solution to USC’s defensive woes will be the next wave of new recruits. USC ranks 15th in the nation and second in the Pac-12 in recruitment of high school players according to 24/7 Sports. In terms of transfer portal recruitment, USC ranks in the top five. 
Much of USC’s recruitment success has come on the offensive end. Quarterback and ESPN No. 1 overall recruit Malachi Nelson leads a group of three five-star commits, all of whom play offense. However, with three four-star defensive commitments, USC is gathering talent that could boost their struggling defense.
USC’s defensive line and secondary will also get some help thanks to the transfer portal, with four-star defensive lineman Anthony Lucas leaving Texas A&M to join the Trojans. 
Regardless, Grinch will face high expectations going into next year. USC was a Pac-12 Championship victory away from earning its first-ever playoff berth before allowing a season-high 47 points to Utah. With an offense that averaged 41.4 points per game, the blame can be easily attributed to a weak defensive unit.
The University of Georgia, who won their second consecutive national championship Monday, has served as a template for a successful college defense in both of their playoff runs. Last season, the Bulldogs had a record-setting five defensive players selected in the first round of the NFL Draft. This season, with expectations slightly lower considering their roster turnover, Georgia’s defense was still dominant, allowing just 15.3 points per game and keeping TCU to just 7 points in their 65-7 blowout in the championship game.
Riley believes that athletes, not coaching, dictates a team’s ability to play at the Bulldogs’ level.
“Whoever is coordinating at Georgia, I’m sure he’s a great coach, but look at the guys last night,” Riley said. “Do they look like our guys? Not yet. Our guys don’t look like that. We will soon.” 
Caleb Williams is entering what will likely be his final season with the Trojans, as the quarterback will almost certainly enter the NFL Draft a year early after his Heisman-winning sophomore season. A strong, or at least stronger, defense could be the difference between falling short in the Pac-12 Championship and securing the Trojans’ first football championship since 2004.

USC will look to rebound against the California Golden Bears this Friday after a gut-wrenching 61-60 loss to UCLA last Sunday.
The Trojans have stepped it up on the defensive end of the floor on their way to a sound 11-4 record, yet sit at just eighth place in the Pac-12 standings. Head Coach Lindsay Gottlieb’s squad has been battling night in and night out, allowing opponents to shoot an ice-cold 33.6% from the field, the 7th lowest mark in the nation. 
USC also ranks 10th in scoring defense, holding opponents to 52.6 points per game, and blocks, rejecting 5.6 shots per game. Sophomore forward Rayah Marshall, standing at 6 foot 4 inches, has been the team’s defensive anchor in the paint — her 3.15 blocks per game are good for second in the nation. But Coach Gottlieb knows sending these Golden Bears back to Northern California with a loss will not be an easy feat. 
“Their guards can really score, and they’re an incredibly complete team,” Gottlieb said in an interview with the Daily Trojan. “They’ve got their depth, they’ve got size, they’ve got guard play, I think they’re gonna come out here and be very hungry and ready to battle us.”
Despite falling to 10th in the Pac-12 standings, the Golden Bears put the rest of the conference on notice as they almost upset the No. 2 ranked Stanford in a close game. The late-game offense came to an abrupt halt as the Golden Bears failed to score across the final four minutes, as they saw Stanford pull away in the fourth quarter. 
Berkeley are spearheaded by their guard trio, who account for over 35 points per game themselves. Sophomore guard Jayda Curry puts up 14.9 points per game but struggled against Stanford, shooting just 4-13 from the field and could be in for a bounce-back game. 
Senior guard Leilani Mcintosh kept the Golden Bears afloat against Stanford, finishing with a team-high 19 points on an efficient 7-13 from the field. She has been electrifying defenses from beyond the arc this season connecting on 47.2% of her jumpers, over a 10% leap from last season. The opposing USC guards will have their hands full come Friday, as a momentary lack of discipline could allow the Golden Bears to blow the game open.
Defense has not been the issue for this Trojan squad, though. The offensive side of the ball has been a real struggle for Gottlieb’s squad — within the Pac-12, they rank in the bottom three in points and turnovers per game, as well as field goal percentage. Graduate transfer Destiny Littleton acknowledged the lackluster offense and believes the team has to find that synergy on that end of the floor. 
“If every single person on the floor has confidence, then the ball has energy,” Littleton said. “When the ball has energy, it’s gonna find the hole. We’re not really too worried. We do know that that’s one of our weakest points of the team. But just like anything else, you get in the gym and you work on it.”
While While USC’s offense may decide this game, the rebounding battle will be a key component in deciding a victor. They mustered just 29 rebounds in Sunday’s loss to UCLA, a season-low. Cal crashed the glass hard on both ends, so the Trojans will have to be locked in and constantly boxing out on the defensive end to now allow second-chance points and extra possessions. Marshall stressed the importance of rebounding ahead of the matchup against Berkeley. 
“A goal of ours is always to be efficient,” Marshall said. “We look to rebound, we look to dominate in every position and just abuse the matchups.”
The Trojans superstar, graduate forward Kadi Sissoko, is in danger of missing the game after sitting out with an injury against UCLA, so Gottlieb will look for a boost in bench scoring to escape California with a win. 
The Trojans take on the Golden Bears at the Galen Center on Friday at 7 p.m. in hopes of climbing up the Pac-12 rankings.

With the halfway-point in the 2022-23 NBA season nearly upon us, it’s time for another check-in with former Trojans plying their trade in the pros.
Power forward Evan Mobley, Cleveland Cavaliers
While Mobley’s slight stagnation offensively has probably disappointed USC and Cleveland fans alike, the near-7-footer remains key to Cleveland’s success on both sides of the floor. The addition of Donovan Mitchell has limited Mobley’s time on the ball to work out the kinks in his offense, but his efficiency has still improved from last season. According to Basketball Reference, Mobley’s effective field goal percentage has increased to 56.1% from last season’s 52.2%, with his field goal attempts per game dropping from 12 to 10.5. Even on low volume, the Cavs can count on Mobley to make big-time shots. In a low-scoring game against the Phoenix Suns last week, Mitchell drove to the rim and kicked the ball out to Mobley, who nailed a jumper from just inside the free-throw line to win the game. More important than Mobley’s point-scoring, though, is his defense. Just as he displayed while at USC, Mobley can both track opponents’ guards and wings to the perimeter or lock down the post alongside center Jarrett Allen. His fluidity and versatility are a key component to the Cavs’s league-best 109 defensive rating. In a crowded field, Mobley won’t earn All-Star honors this season, but he’s still on track to be a top-20 player in the league sooner rather than later.
Guard-Forward DeMar DeRozan, Chicago Bulls
Regardless of DeRozan’s personal success, the Chicago Bulls have had a disappointing season after pushing all of their chips to the middle in 2021-22. The Bulls sit in 10th-place in the Eastern Conference, with the 9th-worst record in the NBA, looking more like a team that should blow it all up for a lottery pick than a conference finalist. Despite that, DeRozan has averaged 26.4 points per game and gets to the free-throw line over 8 times per game, showing his usual scoring aggression and nous. While DeRozan’s 3-pointer improved to a career-high 35.2% in 2021-22, it has fallen back to earth this season at 27.1%, proving last season’s number was a fluke, not the norm. If the Bulls choose to start rebuilding (which they should), DeRozan is one the first players who could be dealt. He would be a quality secondary or even tertiary scorer on another team. The Compton native nearly signed with the Lakers in 2021, so maybe a return to Los Angeles still makes sense. The Lakers would certainly have to clear Russell Westbrook’s salary and send their two remaining future firsts to Chicago to acquire DeRozan, but considering the Pelicans own the Lakers’s 2023 first-round pick, they have no motivation to tank. DeRozan would help that weak Lakers’ roster contend in the playoffs. The NBA trade deadline is Feb. 9, so the Bulls must make a decision on their star forward’s future soon.
Center Nikola Vučević, Chicago Bulls
If the Bulls throw in the towel on the 2022-23 season, they will likely have a harder time finding suitors for Vučević than for DeRozan. Now in his 12th season, the Montenegrin big man hasn’t yet proven how he can contribute to a legitimate title contender. While his scoring remains decent (16.8 points per game this season on 58% effective field goal percentage), the Bulls are 21st in defensive rating and Vučević has a plus/minus of -57. Vučević alone does not bear the burden for those woes, but the NBA has a lot of excellent big men and Vučević does not seem capable of going toe-to-toe with Joel Embiid, Anthony Davis or Nikola Jokić. If the Bulls revert to tanking, Vučević will most likely remain for the rebuild while Zach LaVine and DeRozan get moved. 
Forward-Center Onyeka Okongwu, Atlanta Hawks
In his third season, Okongwu has established himself as a staple piece in Atlanta, playing 23.9 minutes per game on average, nearly double the figure from his rookie season. While the Hawks acquisition of Dejounte Murray hasn’t propelled them to the top of the East as they hoped, they’d undoubtedly be worse off without Okongwu’s energy on the glass. Okongwu’s averaging 7.2 rebounds per game, with 2.7 on the offensive end. With Clint Capela’s recent injury, Okongwu has stepped into the starting lineup and contributed immediately. In a road game at Golden State last week, he played 38 minutes and had a 16-point, 12-rebound double-double as the Hawks took the Warriors to double overtime, losing by just two points. The Hawks may not make it past the play-in games, but Okongwu continues to prove his worth at the NBA level. 
Guard De’Anthony Melton, Philadelphia 76ers
With the fifth and final selection, it’s imperative to highlight De’Anthony Melton’s role as a 3-and-D guard in the 76ers’ system. Melton is playing the most minutes per game of his five-season career so far with 30.1, firmly in Head Coach Doc Rivers’ rotation. The former Memphis Grizzly has also posted 40.3% from three-point range while taking 6.1 triples per game, the highest number of his young career. If the 76ers have any hope of advancing past the first round of the playoffs, they will need Melton and other rotation guys to keep shooting well from range. 
With most of the NBA’s USC presence concentrated in a tough Eastern Conference, there will be plenty of tense Trojan-versus-Trojan matchups down the stretch as playoff seeds are decided.
