The USC Credit Union moved its University Park Campus office to the Campus Center Courtyard after 15 years in King’s Hall.
The branch office was moved to accommodate summer renovations to King’s Hall, which included a revamp of Café 84.
USC Credit Union President and CEO Gary Perez said the non-profit financial cooperative was happy with the more central location.
“The Tutor Center courtyard is filled with energy and excitement and it’s an amazing feeling for USC Credit Union to be a part of that,” Perez said in a press release.
During the move, USC Credit Union members could use the Flower Street Branch, east of Tuscany Apartments.
The USC Credit Union currently serves 60,000 students, staff, faculty and alumni. The USC Credit Union also has a branch on the Health Sciences Campus at Seaver Residence Hall and there are nine ATMs on USC’s Campuses.
The USC Credit Union has more than 6,000 branches and $350 million in assets nationwide.

When considering what college to attend, prospective students pay close attention to a place’s aesthetics and living conditions. Often, one of the major aspects they consider is the food in the school’s dining halls.
Last spring, I came to campus as a prospective student for the “Explore USC” program. I remember having dinner at EVK and feeling disappointed in its disorganized structure, dull colors and bad lighting—especially in contrast to the newer Parkside Restaurant that served the students living at the southwest corner of campus.
When I arrived on campus last week, I was pleasantly surprised to see that EVK’s colors, lighting, and structure had changed. EVK’s summer renovations have significantly improved the dining hall’s appearance, making USC a more attractive place for students to live.
Last year, EVK’s poor aesthetic quality suggested to its visitors that the food was poor quality too. Who would expect great food to come from an outdated, ugly dining hall? Now, however, EVK is brighter, cleaner, and more efficiently organized, offering distinct salad, sandwich, and hot food bars, as well as cereal, dessert and beverage stations. The quality of the facility has strengthened student trust in the quality of the food.
The change in EVK’s environment has not only made it a more appealing place for current students to dine and spend meaningful time with one another. It has also made campus life seem more attractive to those considering attending USC in future years.
When I visited USC, the condition of EVK made me question whether or not I would truly enjoy my on-campus living experience. Prospective students today get a much better impression of the campus dining options and of USC in general.
The new dining hall style and structure has turned EVK into as much of a pleasant place to dine as any of the newer eateries on campus, and has improved the overall appeal of living at USC.

The most surprising development from Thursday’s practice was the re-instatement of redshirt junior linebacker Simione Vehikite to the roster for 2012. Vehikite missed spring practice due to ongoing legal issues stemming from a July 2011 incident where he left the scene of a car accident.
Decisions · USC coach Lane Kiffin decided to give junior linebacker Simione Vehikite his scholarship back after spending time in jail. – Carlo Acenas | Daily Trojan
These issues resulted in Vehikite being sentenced to a year in jail in May for pleading no contest to two felony counts for driving with an .08 percent blood-alcohol level and causing injury.
Vehikite spent three months in jail this summer before being released earlier this week, and Kiffin confirmed that Vehikite received his scholarship back after re-joining the team this week.
“He has done everything, fulfilling his obligation to the team to get back,” Kiffin said of Vehikite, who took 20 units in the spring.  Though he has returned, Kiffin indicated that Vehikite is unlikely to a play meaningful role this fall.
Though Kiffin did not discuss the current situation regarding USC’s 75 scholarships in further detail, Vehikite’s return makes it unlikely that incoming freshman wide receiver Darreus Rogers will qualify academically for USC by the university’s official enrollment deadline of Sept. 14.
On the practice field, the Trojans ran through a relatively light routine on Thursday as they prepared for their home opener.
During coach Lane Kiffin’s tenure, the Trojans have run a lighter practice designed to conserve player stamina on Wednesdays and Thursdays during the preseason and bye weeks. While Kiffin was unimpressed with Wednesday’s effort, he came away content with Thursday’s showing.
“I thought the guys were focused — very crisp, the offense especially,” Kiffin said.
While Saturday begins a season in which a BCS national title is within reach, Kiffin is making sure to limit unnecessary displays of confidence. He especially focused on the Trojans’ pregame routine and manner when they take the field before kickoff against the visiting Warriors on Saturday.
“Everyone wants their 40 minutes before kickoff to run around and get kind of fired up at each other in warm-ups and everything,” Kiffin said. “We just have to educate our guys and really guard against that, guard against losing energy.”
This is a shameful day for USC.  Vehikite forfeited any right he had to play for USC by committing a felony.  Kiffin has no right to dishonor USC and our entire student body by rewarding such behavior.  Now USC has an ex-con on the team.  Vehikite served his time and should be allowed to graduate, but he should not be allowed to join the team and play.  Shame on Pat Haden too for sending the wrong message to our student athletes that there are no consequences to criminal behavior!
According to a statement from Coach Kiffin, Vehikite unlikely to play a meaningful role this season. Then why did he
take away the scholarship from another linebacker Will Andrews who has been involved a lot on special teams the
last season, and is a good backup?

The USC men’s water polo team has waited patiently. Now the time has come to defend its water polo title. The journey begins this weekend at the UCLA Invitational, which will serve as an opportunity for the team to get into midseason form as quickly as possible.
Back for more · Senior driver Tobias Preuss scored 16 goals last season for the Trojans. He was named an honorable mention All-American in 2011. – Daily Trojan file photo
 
“We feel very good,” USC coach Jovan Vavic said. “We have had a very productive and good training, and I think the guys are very anxious and excited about starting to play finally.”
The biggest storyline of the offseason has revolved around who will replace departed star goalkeeper Joel Dennerly, and though the season is finally set to begin, Vavic still has yet to officially name a starter, and might not do so anytime soon.
“Our team doesn’t really have starting positions; we have guys who play and guys who don’t play,” Vavic said. “So both of our goalies are going to play. We’re going to have [redshirt sophomore] Ely [Bonilla] and [junior] James [Clark] compete for the playing time.”
When asked if there was any timetable on how long the two would share playing time, Vavic made it clear there was no rush to anoint a main goalie just yet.
“It’s hard to say right now,” Vavic said. I would say that they are both good enough so we can play both of them against any opponent and then we adjust.” Regardless of when, or if, a decision is made, USC opens its season with a doubleheader against the University of La Verne and Pomona-Pitzer College, followed by scrimmages against tougher foes Pepperdine, UC Santa Barbara, Chapman and UCLA.USC has defeated UCLA each of the last two seasons for the national championship.
“We’ve been looking forward to [the first game] all summer,” senior driver Michael Rosenthal said.  “It’s a lot of fun playing in real games and we can’t wait for the season to start.”
In addition to breaking in a pair of new goalies, the rest of the squad plans to focus on helping Bonilla and Clark adapt to their potential starting roles.
“We always try to work on defense,” Rosenthal said. “These scrimmages are a good chance for us to see our opponent and see how they’re going to play against us.”
The team will also use the invitational as an opportunity to incorporate as many players as possible into the lineup.
“We’re going to try some different things,” Vavic said. “We’re going to play as many players as we can, and give everybody an opportunity to show what they can do and get ready for some of the more important and tougher games.”

In its first three games this season, the USC women’s soccer team (2-1, 0-0) has seen six of its eight goals scored by freshmen. The statistic not only bodes well for the team as it enters a difficult stretch, but also for future seasons.
Youth movement · Senior forward/midfielder Samantha Johnson is one of the few upperclassmen playing a major role for USC thus far in 2012. – Daily Trojan file photo
“A lot of the credit has to be given to the freshmen,” senior forward/midfielder Samantha Johnson said. “They’ve all just come in wanting to learn everything, and we as veterans are learning from them, too. We have great teamwork going on.”
Off to their best start since the 2008 season, USC has a busy weekend ahead, as it hosts No. 4 Duke and San Diego at the USC Fútbol Classic on McAlister Field.
Coming off their 4-1 loss last weekend against Minnesota, USC seeks to rebound against the Blue Devils on Friday at 4 p.m. The game will be televised on the Pac-12 networks, as the Women of Troy will appear on the station for the second time in four games.
“Right now, a key thing for us is focus,” USC coach Ali Khosroshahin said. “With a team like Duke, it is important to keep the eye on the ball and not have any mental lapses.”
Duke boasts a 2-1 record heading into the match after suffering a 3-2 overtime loss to No. 20 Florida last weekend. The Women of Troy and Blue Devils have faced off only once before in 1999, where USC bested Duke 2-0.
The schedule does not ease up Sunday when USC squares off against San Diego at 2 p.m.
The Toreros drew their record to 2-2 after two wins last week, beating No. 12 Texas A&M 1-0 and Minnesota 3-2 — a team that beat USC by three goals.
“In order to succeed this weekend, ball possession will be incredibly important,” Khosroshahin said. “We have to take care of the ball in key game moments. That’s something that the team has been working on a lot.”
USC has seven newcomers in the starting lineup — six of whom are full-time starters.
Towering at 5-foot-9 and 6-foot-1, respectively, freshman forward Jamie Fink and freshman defender Erin Owen have been stout defenders, supporting senior defender Kristina Noriega in the back line.
“[Fink] and [Owens] are doing very well,” said Khosroshahin. “They’re eager and have been working hard.”
Key players have also emerged on offense.
In her first season at USC, junior midfielder Jordan Marada has been a valuable asset. Coincidentally, the transfer from Saint Mary’s scored her first goal for USC against her former school during USC’s 4-1 home opening win.
“In terms of attack, [Marada] has been a standout so far,” Khosroshahin said.
Despite the uptick in competition and the need for continued development from its newcomers, USC is not altering its mindset.
“We look at every game as a big game,” Johnson said. “We take care of our bodies, come in with a good mindset so that we’re refreshed and ready to take on the competition when the weekend comes.”

Former USC defensive lineman Armond Armstead has sued the USC after alleging that he suffered a heart attack as a result of forced injections of a painkiller, the Sacramento Bee reports.
Lawsuit · Former USC defensive lineman Armond Armstead (94) is suing the school, claiming he suffered a heart attack forced pain killers. – Chris Pham | Daily Trojan
 
Armstead claims that the painkiller Toradol was administered 10 times by USC’s medical staff between 2009 and 2011 to treat separate foot, shoulder and chest injuries. According to the lawsuit, the multiple injections were the catalyst for the heart attack he suffered.
Armstead was unaware of having suffered the heart attack until he was officially diagnosed on March 3, 2011 at USC University Hospital. He did not play for the Trojans again after failing to gain medical clearance.
Armstead’s lawsuit does not disclose a financial settlement amount, but it alleges the heart attack ruined his chances of playing in the NFL, meaning he may request an NFL player’s salary, worth millions of dollars.
The lawsuit also asserts that Armstead requested a transfer after making a full recovery and was denied on numerous occasions.
“It would be inappropriate at this time for USC to make a comment about the lawsuit,” the school said in response.
Coming out of Pleasant Grove High School in Elk Wood, California, Armstead was a highly rated defensive tackle prospect. He played for USC from 2008-2010, starting 12 games as a junior.
Armstead’s younger brother, Arik, is a freshman defensive lineman at the University of Oregon. Arik originally committed to USC but rescinded that commitment in mid-October of 2011, shortly after older brother Armond was barred from gaining medical clearance to return for his senior season.
At the time of the de-commitment, Arik told the Los Angeles Times, “[His brother not receiving permission to return to the field has] definitely affected [his] family and [he’ll] just leave it at that.”
Currently, Armond Armstead is playing for the Toronto Argonauts in the Canadian Football League. He has recorded 19 tackles and one sack through nine games.

Saturday’s opener against Hawai’i is intended to be a tune-up, a blowout against a team unable to match USC’s firepower. A quick eye test during warm-ups will betray an undersized Hawai’i squad that the Trojans should simply out-talent.
Sound familiar?
The Sept. 3, 2010, game against Hawai’i was played under a similar narrative, only to become a nail-biter in which the Trojans prevailed 49-36.
Even as they breathed a sigh of relief that night, USC fans, not deluded by Trojan spirit, likely understood that the 2010 edition was not reminiscent of teams before. Fears that sanctions might handcuff the team suddenly felt more real.
The narrow victory foretold what would become a yearlong malaise for the Trojans and set off questions concerning the team’s urgency to win without the potential to play for a bowl game.
Of course, the opener was not all negative. Then-sophomore quarterback Matt Barkley announced himself as the face of the program with five touchdowns, and Lane Kiffin notched his first win as the head coach at USC.
But, it didn’t feel like a victory.
The Warriors exposed USC’s defense as physical, but plodding, unable to play in space against up-tempo spread offenses.
Despite excellent production from Barkley and former running back Marc Tyler, who ran for 154 yards on 17 carries, the game’s outcome was in doubt until former linebacker Michael Morgan knocked Hawai’i quarterback Bryant Moniz out of the game with a vicious hit to the head that bordered on a personal foul. On the play, Moniz had scrambled to the Trojans’ one-yard line, setting up a touchdown run on the next play that cut the Warriors’ deficit to 11 points with 1:54 remaining in the third quarter.
Hawai’i never recovered from losing its first-string quarterback, but the rest of college football had seen enough: This was not the same USC defense that once made opposing receivers think twice about catching a ball in traffic or that featured playmakers at all three levels.
Following the contest, USC dropped from No. 14 to No. 16 in the Associated Press poll and proceeded to plummet an additional four spots after beating Virginia and Minnesota unconvincingly by a combined 14 points.
Most USC fans groused, especially when the unbeaten Trojans only moved up two sports to No. 18 after whooping Washington State the following week, 50-16.
To the surprise of no one who watched the first few games objectively, USC sputtered the rest of the season.The team’s porous defense surrendered 26.7 points per game and 5.91 yards per opponents’ offensive play. Compare that to 2008, the year in which the Trojans defeated Penn State in the Rose Bowl — that defense allowed only 9.0 points per game and 3.61 yards per offensive play.
Fast-forward to Sept. 1, 2012 and it’s obvious that tomorrow’s contest is much more than a perfunctory dress rehearsal for the conference schedule.
Even a blowout victory will have a ‘ho-hum’ quality. Under coach Norm Chow, Hawai’i won’t simply wilt, but there are few scenarios under which the Trojans won’t beat the Warriors by at least four touchdowns.
The Trojans must win, and win decisively, emerging from the Coliseum a dominant team in all phases of the game — not just for their fans’ collective psyche, but also to make a statement.
For what it’s worth, Vegas places the Trojans as 40-point favorites — though personally, I would take the under.
This is also the first opportunity for opposing coaches to view game film on the 2012 Trojans. Like they did in 2010 when they brought to light USC’s lack of defensive speed, the Warriors will have the opportunity to expose weaknesses in USC once again.
Though the odds are stacked against Hawai’i pulling off the upset victory, this game can lay the blueprint by which future teams with more talent will try to down the Trojans.
Appearing fallible against Hawai’i would be an ominous sign for USC’s prospects going forward. Tomorrow’s matchup will set the tone for the rest of the season and give an early indication as to whether USC is merely masquerading as a consensus top-three team.

No doubt left last night! FIGHT ON!
