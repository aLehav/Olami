The Alumni Association has created an app in addition to the online “Fight Online” networking program to enhance networking for USC alumni. The app was updated in September and is now available for download.
Originally, the Fight Online program allowed alumni to connect with other alumni, but it was only available online. Now, the mobile app will allow alumni to connect to it on a real-time, real-location basis. The new app portion will require alumni to sign up for it before being able to use it.
Denise Lopez, senior director of alumni relations for the Alumni Association, described new features that are only available on the app.
“The mobile app runs in a different way where you can go online and see other Trojans that are in the area,” Lopez said. “It geo-locates other alumni in the area to see if you can connect with Trojans nearby.”
The app was created by the same company that developed the Game Day app for USC Athletics to allow for a streamlined process and line of apps for all of the Trojan Family.
The app also allows includes special perks for alumni.
“You can also search for Trojan businesses, and it will show you all the businesses so you can frequent USC businesses or you can go to the real estate section to see the list of Trojans that are real estate agents,” Lopez said. “Many businesses and Trojans opt in to have special offers for other Trojans only.”
These perks would be available only for those using the mobile app.
The Alumni Association hopes to have more members download the app during homecoming weekend. Lopez said that as of now, there are almost 3,000 alumni signed up with the networking program and the number is increasing.
There have been several initiatives to increase awareness and membership for the new app. Lopez said the university has sent emails to registered alumni, placed posters to entrances around campus, run advertisements in Trojan Family magazine and given presentations about the app to large audiences.
According to Lopez, the app will change the way alumni can network.
“Before you would have no idea to know if you were sitting next to a Trojan on a bus,” Lopez said.

J Street U USC held a discussion Thursday night in Seeley G. Mudd Hall entitled “Groundhog Day in Gaza: What Drives Cycles of Violence Between Israel and Hamas and How It Can End” concerning the future of the Gaza region in light of this past summer’s outbreak of violence.
Expert opinion · Hussein Ibish, a senior fellow at the American Task Force on Palestine, spoke to students about the Israel-Palestine conflict. Thursday. – Samhita Swamy | Daily Trojan
The event featured Hussein Ibish, a senior fellow at the American Task Force on Palestine.
“We are a Washington, D.C.-based office of six people who believe that the focal point of the issue has to be American foreign policy and American national interest,” Ibish said.
J Street U is a national organization that advocates for long-term peaceful solutions to the conflict in the region. The USC chapter is one of more than  50 and began in the spring of last year.
“The reason we brought it [to USC] was because we recognized that there was a vacuum of discussion on campus,” said Yasmeen Serhan, co-founder of USC’s chapter and special projects editor of the Daily Trojan. “There wasn’t a space for us to really discuss the pragmatic steps being taken on the international level, so we felt like bringing this organization would provide students a space to respectfully discuss the issues.”
About 35 students from various demographic backgrounds attended the discussion.
“I came to the discussion because I was interested in hearing both sides,” said Mackenzie Gansert, a senior majoring in political economy. “I think it’s really important that we have a dialogue on campus, and this was the first time I had heard of such dialogue going on. I thought it was really interesting to hear the perspective of someone who has written books on this topic.”
Specifically, J Street U supports a two-state solution in which the sovereignties of both Israel and Palestine can be respected separately.
“Our purpose is to support a diplomatic solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, with an independent, secure state of Israel alongside an independent, secure state of Palestine,” Serhan said. “Ibish has a very solid understanding of this issue. He really does focus on the Middle East region as a whole, which allows for an analytical, philosophical perspective.”
Ibish expressed his concern with both Israel’s and Hamas’ aggression actions throughout history, which have often involved territorial occupation.
“Israel and Palestine both have a right to defend themselves, but occupying an enemy territory is an illegal imposition on a people who deserve, and have every right, to live in freedom,” he said.
Estee Chandler, an organizer for the L.A. Jewish Voice for Peace, expressed concern with Ibish’s stance on U.S. national interest in the region.
“What would happen if [the United States] had an outside entity imposing a solution on us?” Chandler asked.
Chandler also disagreed with the notion that the region must necessarily split into two states.
“Whether two states or one, the outcome should include security, justice and equality for all people,” she added.
Ibish, however, said he felt a two-state solution was necessary to bring stability to the region.
“I’ve becoming disenchanted with the one-state solution,” Ibish said. “We’ve had a single state since 1967, and it’s awful and immoral. The people there are non-citizens. They are living in fear. There’s no way to tweak this reality we have. Something revolutionary needs to happen there, and the only way I can think to do it is by having two states.”
The J Street U USC will be having its next discussion at Ground Zero on Oct. 27 at 6:00 p.m.
 
USC now has a J Street? What a shame.
“Why is it Muslims are free to violently conquer lands
anywhere and everywhere without a word of protest from American Muslims, or any
Muslims or any liberals?
But if Jews have a legally established homeland Muslims and
Liberals and their ilk will never stop protesting against it? Why is this do
you suppose? What explanation can be given other than as the Qur’an states
repeatedly that Islam’s goal is to establish a worldwide caliphate in which all
non-Muslims are subjugated.
For instance, Mohammed was born around 571 AD thousands and
thousands of years after Hinduism, Buddhism and Judaism existed. But within a
few centuries of Mohammed’s birth Islam had violently conquered vast sections
of Asia, all of North Africa and smaller sections of Southern Europe.
Now Muslims tell us that all this land belongs to them even
though, for instance, in Afghanistan they killed every last Buddhist who once
lived there. According to Muslim logic per Israel shouldn’t this land belong to
the Buddhists?
Or in North Africa all the Berbers have been forcibly
converted to Islam or have been killed and now we’re told all this vast
landmass belongs to Islam. That’s interesting, if not completely hypocritical.
And what about Southern Thailand. Did anyone know that in
the last several years something like 5,000 Buddhists have been killed by
Muslims because, or so we’re told, the land the Buddhists are on belongs to
Islam.
And Southern Russia? Muslims are relentlessly waging a slow
reign of terror in Russia because, you guessed it, Russians are treating
Muslims poorly and they should give up the Southern section of that country to
Muslims since Islam deserves all lands.
Or, let’s take Sudan as another example. How many millions
have been killed in Sudan? How many babies and children have starved in Sudan
while Islamists steal the food from aid compounds? How many women have Muslims
gang-raped in Sudan all because that land belongs to Muslims and only Muslims.
All other people can go somewhere else to live, I guess. They can go to South
Sudan, but wait a minute, now Muslims are killing the people of South Sudan
too.
And Kashmir? The same. Despite Hindus having lived there for
3,000 years – something like 2,000+ years before Mohammed was born – Muslims
tell us Kashmir belongs to them. Amazing logic isn’t it? Muslim logic, I guess.
And that brings us to Israel. Israel also belongs to Islam
too. Did you know that? It’s true. Just ask a Muslim or a liberal if you
prefer. Even though it’s no bigger than a small pimple on the caliphate’s ass
it is still their land and they will fight to the death to prove their point.
Doesn’t the logic here make a lot of sense. Isn’t it as
clear as day? Of course it does. The world belongs to Islam and we’re mere
players on their stage.

This weekend, the Environmental Student Assembly aims to host a tailgate with zero leftover waste for the first time ever.
The tailgate will be set up on the Social Sciences building lawn near McCarthy Quad.
The event will take place before the Homecoming game against Colorado.

Shawn Rhoads, director of the Environmental Student Assembly, said that the event is to promote the Zero Waste Certification program that is part of the Office of Sustainability.
“A number of organizations, departments or people that want to make their tailgate zero waste certified go through the Office of Sustainability, and we want to show people that this is a thing,” Rhoads said.
The Office of Sustainability’s program, Tailgate Waste Diversion, was launched in fall 2012 and aims to teach tailgaters ways to make their pre-game activities more sustainable.
Rhoads said that at an event that is certified, there is zero waste — everything is recycled or composted, and there are no single-use items.
“It’s very similar to ESA’s certification program, and when we created that program, we used a couple of things that the Tailgate Waste Diversion program addresses,” he said. “We want students to have the option to be sustainable.”
The ESA tailgate will allow students to have the option to recycle their plastic Solo cups. Students can collect Solo cups from their tailgates and hand them over to volunteers at the ESA tailgate in exchange for free game day-related items. There will be different tiers of prizes, each corresponding to a number of cups recycled. The Office of Sustainability will recycle the cups following the game.
The tailgate will also include a blender bike that ESA will use to make smoothies. ESA hopes that the incentive will be enough for students who are tailgating to be environmentally aware and recycle. Kyleen Marcella, co-assistant director of ESA, said that Solo cups are the largest part of the waste generated on game days.
“It’s important to be conscious of how many Solo cups are wasted,” Marcella said. “If you’re using a Solo cup, try not to throw it away and reuse it instead. When people are planning their tailgate, they should be conscious of that.”
Marcella also stated that ESA wants the zero waste tailgate to quickly become a regular event on game days.
“Since this is ESA’s first fall semester, we’re only doing one tailgate. We want to see how successful this event will be, but eventually, yes, we want it to be a regular event.”
Arnav Garg, a sophomore majoring in computer science, was unsure if the event would be successful on a larger scale, however.
“There are so many tailgates all around campus, and I don’t think that people will be willing to walk over to the ESA tailgate with their Solo cup stacks,” Garg said. “When you’re tailgating and having fun, you’re not really inclined to make the effort.”
Others were more optimistic. Sandy Nguyen, a junior majoring in business administration, thought it was a great plan.
“I definitely think it’s a good idea because it would reduce the waste left behind after all the tailgating, and obviously it’s helping the environment,” she said. “If they get the word out more, and people know more about it, it will be more successful.”

Program Board held the university’s homecoming carnival and rally Thursday night on McCarthy Quad. The celebratory rally presented an opportunity for USC students and faculty to showcase their Trojan pride in anticipation of the homecoming football game Saturday against Colorado.

In the past, USC has held homecoming events that focused on students in Greek life such as the annual float-building contest. This year, Program Board implemented significant changes in the layout of the homecoming event by enhancing student and faculty participation.
Shawn Rhoads, the executive director of the Environmental Student Assembly, spoke about ESA’s efforts to involve more students in homecoming.
“Our vision was that we wanted homecoming to be a lot more inclusive to the entire USC community — to reach out to everyone, so that way the entire Trojan family could be a part of homecoming this year,” Rhoads said.
Over the summer, ESA envisioned a plan to host a large event in which USC students and faculty could come together to represent their diverse interests. ESA followed up on this proposition and presented ideas to Campus Activities to plan an all-inclusive event for all of the committees and assemblies under Program Board. Once the proposition was approved, each of the 14 committees and assemblies began to plan activities unique to their group’s interests.
Ama Amoafo-Yeboah, executive director of Program Board, shed light on the importance of integrating students.
“I think it’s really important because all of the organizations within program board represent something different,” Amoafo-Yeboah said. “I think it just shows how diverse the Trojan family is, and this is an opportunity for everyone to come together and that is what I think the purpose of homecoming is — people are able to come back and see what has evolved at USC.”
The Environmental Student Assembly’s “Rock the Bike” activity showcased sustainable energy. Members from various organizations powered the stage for performances from DJ Cl!ff’s and Blu_Noise’s by riding the stationary bikes attached to the stage.
“Rock the Bike,” a nonprofit environmental advocacy group based near San Francisco, strives to make a lasting impact on the current climate crisis. In order to promote bike culture, ESA and “Rock the Bike” enlisted sponsors within each USC committee and assembly to ride stationary bikes at the event in order to generate the electricity needed to power the stage.
The event included performances from the Trojan Marching Band and Blu_Noise and featured bungee-jumping sponsored by Special Events Committee, complimentary boba from the Asian Pacific American Student Assembly, food trucks sponsored by the Black Student Assembly and a photo booth sponsored by the Political Student Assembly. The rally also included a canvas panel decorating sponsored by the Performing Arts Committee, a tie-dye station sponsored by Trojan Pride and an eating contest sponsored by the Latina/o Student and International Student Assemblies, whose four winners were awarded Amazon gift cards.
Mohammed Al-Ghazal, a second-year graduate student studying petroleum engineering and one of the winners of the eating contest, shared his experience at the rally.
“It feels amazing to be a part of USC events, especially those that are related to the Trojan spirit such as the football homecoming rally,” Al-Ghazal said.  “The contest itself was very entertaining, there was a lot of competition. Being among my friends, classmates and colleagues makes it even more interesting.”

At first inspection, Showtime’s new show The Affair has a plenty interesting concept. It looks at the story of an affair from both the point of view of the man, Noah (Dominic West) and the woman, Alison (Ruth Wilson). In the pilot, the first half hour showed the viewers a narrative from the point of view of Noah. The second half hour gave us the same side of the story from Alison’s point of view. The conceit is interesting enough, as it looks at the different memories of the same situations in the minds of different people. It is a bit bizarre, however, to be talking about The Affair’s multiple-POV structure so soon after the release of The Disappearance of Eleanor Rigby.
An Affair to remember · Dominic West and Ruth Wilson both take on the challenge of playing two distinct versions of the same character: As their characters percieve themselves and as they each percieve each other. – Photo courtesy of Showtime
The similarities with Rigby are a bit uncanny, even beyond telling the same story two different times from two different points of view in Rashomon-like fashion. Both stories deal with the end of love and strangely both have at least one character dealing with the death of a child. Rigby premiered in September 2013, Affair was picked up in January 2014, so the parallels between the two are worrisome at the very least. Despite this major sticking point, the show does have some kernels of promise — it might offer a very interesting look at the unpredictability of human memory differently enough from Rigby to be valuable in its own right, despite being destined to be intertwined with it just as in other recent examples of pieces about very similar subject matter being released very close to each other like The Illusionist with The Prestige or Mirror, Mirror was with Snow White and the Huntsman.
The strength of Rigby lies in the moments where the two protagonists are apart, providing the viewer a wealth of context to understand their motivations. In The Affair, the focus is much more on the overlapping moments. The differences between what the characters remember about the blossoming affair are significant, and The Affair differs greatly from Rigby in the degree to which the memories vary. Where in Rigby the differences are very subtle, in The Affair the differences are drastic. These are so different that they strain belief that two people could remember the same events in such categorically different ways. These events, however, are being told in a police interrogation (for as yet unrevealed reasons) and there are clues that this interrogation is going on a significant amount of years after the fact. So, it could be argued that a distinction between Rigby and Affair is that Affair deals with the effects of time on memory as opposed to just the effects that differences in perspective alone may have on perception. The True Detective-style future-interrogation plot device also mitigates the strain on suspension of disbelief created by drastic differences between Noah’s and Alison’s memories.
West and Wilson are well cast in their roles and both seem up to the task of playing both versions of their characters, with one perceived through their own eyes and the one seen through the eyes of their counterpart. Whereas Noah is a caring father being pursued by the light-hearted Alison in his eyes, through hers we see the very sexually aggressive Noah chasing the emotionally scarred Alison. Both West and Wilson play these vastly different personalities with enough skill to make the viewer still believe they are the same character, despite the difference. They do this while dealing with less-than-stellar dialogue. Conversation tends to be overly complex, sapping its naturalism.
In the beginning of the first episode, when Noah is talking to his family, firing off cynical witticisms to his 6-year-old son, the viewer quickly gets engulfed in a surprising darkness. Over the course of the hour, depending on who is perceiving the action, the viewer is treated to a 12-year-old faking a suicide, a different character openly contemplating suicide, a husband raping his wife and the aforementioned character dealing with the loss of a young son. The hits just keep on coming. The many intrusions of darkness into the storyline threaten to overshadow the titular affair. So much so that, combined with the unexplained police interrogation at the end, it makes one wonder just how dark the show will go before its 10-episode run is up.
There is a lot going on in The Affair right off the bat. At times, it is sufficient to distract from the many similarities to The Disappearance of Eleanor Rigby. But, overall, this is not the case. The two works are not the same, but the similarities are enough to cast a shadow over the entire, pardon the pun, affair. Under that shadow lies the makings of a good show, but whether it comes together remains to be seen.

Good news, Twin Peaks fans. That show you like is going to come back in style.
Last week, co-creators David Lynch and Mark Frost announced their intention to bring back their beautiful, bizarre and endlessly influential series for a nine-episode limited run on Showtime in 2016. Even more exciting: Lynch, the visionary filmmaker who cornered the market on American surrealism with ethereal masterpieces such as Blue Velvet and Mulholland Drive, is attached to direct every episode. The revival, which begins production sometime next year, will pick up 25 years after the events of the first series in order to resolve certain plotlines that were left dangling after the show’s cancellation.
Strange Brew · Coffee-loving Special Agent Cooper (Kyle MacLachlan, left) is called in to investigate the murder of homecoming queen Laura Palmer (Sheryl Lee) in David Lynch and Mark Frost’s 1990 television series Twin Peaks. Showtime will begin airing nine new episodes in 2016. — Photo courtesy of CBS Television
The original Twin Peaks, which ran for two seasons between 1990 and 1991, has taken up permanent residence in our cultural dreamscape like no other show of its kind. The idea of a soap opera with shades of existential horror practically screams limited appeal, but Lynch and Frost’s grand experiment — injecting art house aesthetics and cinematic nerve and verve into the sterile confines of primetime network television — garnered mainstream popularity and widespread critical acclaim, at least during its first season, by relying on two age-old hooks: engaging characters and an engrossing, highly addictive mystery.
Millions of viewers tuned in every week to watch Special Agent Dale Cooper (Kyle MacLachlan), the chipper, sharp-dressed FBI man whose enthusiasm for justice is matched only by his appetite for “damn fine” coffee and cherry pie, and the stalwart Sheriff Harry S. Truman (Michael Ontkean) investigate the murder of Laura Palmer (Sheryl Lee), the small town homecoming queen with a well of poisonous secrets. Fans obsessively poured over the now-iconic dream sequences — especially the ones with the dancing, backwards-talking dwarf (Michael J. Anderson, better known as The Man from Another Place) — and developed an encyclopedic knowledge of the seemingly idyllic community and the legion of eccentrics, from the harmless kooks to the hell-spawned killers, who call it home.
Everything was “peachy keen” — one of Lynch’s favorite descriptors — until CBS network executives forced the writers to reveal the identity of Laura’s killer, and the show’s second season suffered from a marked lack of focus as a result (both Lynch and Frost were busy attending to other projects by this time, leaving the series in far less capable hands), which in turn led to plummeting ratings, a punishingly severe season finale that wound up doubling as a series finale and, in a fortunate turn of events, an eventful afterlife as a pop cultural touchstone.
Lynch attempted to give fans a degree of closure with 1992’s temporally twisted sequel-prequel Twin Peaks: Fire Walk with Me, but the film, a graphic, unnerving depiction of Laura Palmer’s last week on Earth, was simply too radical a departure from the show and died a quick death at the box office after being torched by critics and irate fans. Today, however, Fire Walk with Me has been reevaluated as a flawed but powerful work of minor-key brilliance, partially because of the newly released “The Missing Pieces,” a bevy of deleted scenes from the movie that shed some much-needed light on the whereabouts of characters from the series who weren’t present in the theatrical cut.
The Showtime revival is just the latest proof of the enduring legacy of Twin Peaks. If we’re truly living in the Golden Age of Television, this is the show that provided the era with its alchemical spark. Its time on the air might have been short-lived, but it casts a long shadow over the entire medium. From True Detective and The Killing to less obvious examples such as Breaking Bad and Mad Men, every long-form narrative with cinematic production values, multi-episode story arcs and a strong authorial voice owes Lynch and Frost an immeasurable debt of gratitude.
A pressing question remains, however: Will the Twin Peaks revival reach the emotional and technical heights of the original series, specifically the first season? Television history is littered with the carcasses of ill-advised continuations. For every Battlestar Galactica and Star Trek: The Next Generation, there’s a Return to Mayberry and I Still Dream of Jeannie. Some shows were just meant to stay dead, especially when the years start turning into decades.
Also, with so many other programs either paying homage or stealing wholesale from its stylistic playbook, will a modern Twin Peaks be able to stand out in the small-screen landscape it helped create? That remains to be seen, but there are plenty of reasons to remain optimistic. In addition to directing all the episodes, Lynch is teaming up with Frost to write and produce the show, meaning both creators will be giving the project their undivided attention. Incidentally, with the exception of a few music videos, commercials and concert films, this will be Lynch’s first time in the director’s chair since the release of Inland Empire back in 2006. Showtime, for its part, is a premium cable channel known for trusting their showrunners and giving them a great deal of creative freedom. That means Twin Peaks will be virtually unencumbered by the two factors that hastened its decline in the ’90s: network censors and meddling executives.
There’s also the issue of casting to consider. MacLachlan, a Lynch veteran who’s easily the most recognizable character in the series, is widely assumed to be reprising his role as Cooper, while Ontkean has already expressed an interest in donning his sheriff hat again. And it’s next to impossible to envision Twin Peaks without Catherine E. Coulson as the Log Lady, the inscrutable fan favorite who carries around a large chunk of wood said to possess the power of prophecy. But what about the characters whose actors have died? The show’s primary villain for example, a malevolent spirit named BOB, was played by set dresser-turned-actor Frank Silva, who passed away in 1995. It’s difficult to imagine anyone else skulking around bedposts and laughing maniacally in the strobe-lit Red Room with such rabid, unhinged glee. The late character actor Don S. Davis, who portrayed Major Garland Briggs with a tenor of gentle authority, will also be sorely missed in the new series.
So what does the future hold for Twin Peaks and its devoted fan base now that nearly a quarter-century’s worth of patience has finally paid off? I think Special Agent Cooper himself said it best: “I have no idea where this will lead us, but I have a definite feeling it will be a place both wonderful and strange.”

Chefs of the world’s finest restaurants are notorious for being demanding and maddeningly particular to their staffs — not to their guests. But to patronize a restaurant by chef and Los Angeles food scene luminary Ludo Lefebvre is to be beholden to his strategic conceits.
Big steaks · The steak-frites at Petit Trois are exactingly prepared. A large ribeye is cooked to a flawless medium rare, topped with an onion soup sauce and accompanied with french fries cooked in beef tallow. – Uracha Chaiyapinunt | Daily Trojan
His infamous “traveling pop-up” dining concept LudoBites crashed OpenTable servers despite its unpredictability and constantly changing locations, and his brick-and-mortar restaurant Trois Mec’s ticketing system might become the sole reason Angelenos actually start planning their lives out two weeks in advance.
Lefebvre is starting to dictate the rules of the game in the L.A. fine dining scene — and at his newest Hollywood French bar and bistro concept Petit Trois, it might be good policy to just succumb to his demands.
Along with his Trois Mec teammates Jon Shook and Vinny Dotolo (both formerly of Animal), Lefebvre envisioned Petit Trois as a simple, accessible bistro serving the French food he enjoyed in his home country, with a pared-down cocktail program and a handful of carefully selected wines and beers. There’s nothing simple about the preparation of the food, though — in following with Trois Mec, Lefebvre has a full-disclosure open kitchen so that diners can appreciate the craftsmanship that goes into each dish.
At one lunch service, a chef prepares a green bean salad with surgical precision: bathing each long bean with milk-white dressing, plating and then inserting translucent slivers of plum at careful intervals before finishing with Microplane-grated fresh horseradish. The salad is a marvel, with each individual bean snapping with a juicy, crisp texture that practically sings the arrival of the early fall season.
Steak frites, a classic brasserie staple, is executed with a similar clinical precision. A healthy-sized entrecote is pan-seared, basted and then set to rest before being topped with an onion soup sauce and accompanied by a bed of tallow-cooked French fries. The entire dish: the sauce, the unctuous fries and the steak come together to create a French trifecta of umami, with flavors so savory and rich that it almost seems like a crime to serve it for lunch.
Speaking of rich, the already famous crisped chicken leg with frisée salad is impossibly juicy with skin a tad on the greasy side, but it’s one of Petit Trois’ highlights: The varying textures from the crisped brioche crumbs to the juicy dark meat and the salad all balance one another and practically beg for a decent, crisp white wine to counter the fattiness of the chicken skin.
This brings up another point: Almost all of Lefebvre’s dishes at Petit Trois can be elevated with a beverage pairing. Lefebvre’s cocktail program, much like Lefebvre himself, is direct, intentional and fuss-free. With a wine list spanning about six relatively young French options, it would come off a bit curt if it weren’t for the fact that Lefebvre and his team probably know better than diners when it comes to pairing his food with wine.
The above sentiment of “trusting Ludo” seems to be an overarching theme of dining at one of Lefebvre’s restaurants. Los Angeles is a city where a successful dining experience is governed not only by the food and the cachet of the chefs back of house, but very much by the people who are eating in the same room. The latter of these is impeded by the fact that the aptly named “Petit” Trois is comprised of one bar seating about eight people and another bar directly behind it that seats about 12.
The sparse, austere seating arrangement has the diners’ attentions flow either into a mirror sitting less than a foot away from their faces at the back bar, or staring directly at the kitchen assembly line. Petit Trois is not a place to eat with a group of friends — it’s far more conducive to eat alone or with one other person at most.
There is no people-watching here, despite the proliferation of immaculately appointed beautiful somebodies swishing about, trying to flag down the host or order another glass of wine. Petit Trois doesn’t just dismiss social pretenses; it actively stifles them with its spartan ambiance and no reservations policy.
That’s because at Petit Trois, Lefebvre is the high-profile owner, the mastermind and the biggest name all at once. The small bistro pulls the bright lights of Hollywood to the food and gives no quarter to the social niceties of dining. So eating at a restaurant by Ludo Lefebvre guarantees an experience: a tricky one trying to get tickets for seats in the case of Trois Mec, or at Petit Trois, one that can’t be easily shared with friends. In any case, the actual food transcends social considerations. It takes a damned skilled chef to bring this much attention to his food — and Ludo Lefebvre, Vinny Dotolo and Jon Shook might be the only ones in Los Angeles right now who can pull it off.

With wins  over then-No. 1 UCLA and then-No. 3 Cal last weekend en route to capturing its third straight SoCal Tournament Championship, the USC men’s water polo team recently claimed the top spot in the Collegiate Water Polo Association rankings for the first time this season.
Set to face third-ranked  Stanford in Palo Alto on Oct. 18, the now-No. 1 USC team will head to Palo Alto this weekend looking to assert its position as king of the hill.
The six-time defending NCAA champion Trojans defeated the host-Bruins 10-6 in the semifinals of the SoCal Tournament last weekend and edged out the Bears 10-9 in the finals, gaining retribution for their only two losses of the year — the Trojans fell in their first meetings with both the Bruins and the Bears at the Kap7 NorCal Classic last month.
Sophomore driver Nick Bell proved to be the difference for the Trojans last weekend.
Bell, who missed the first 13 games of the year — including the NorCal Classic — with a back injury, notched 10 goals through four games at the SoCal Tournament and earned Mountain Pacific Sports Federation Player of the Week honors for his efforts.
“I’d been out for eight weeks, and I just had that fire in me, that desire to get back in there and play with my team,” Bell said. “I think it was very important for us to win this tournament. It let everyone know that we’re here to play — we’re not here for third, we’re not here for fourth. We’re here to win the championship.”
Standing at 16-2 on the season and 2-0 in conference play, the youthful Trojan squad will have its championship capabilities put to the test once again in this weekend’s battle between No. 1 and No. 3.
Stanford’s two losses also came at the hands of Cal and UCLA, but just like the Trojans, the Cardinal have also beaten both those teams at different points this season.
USC head coach Vavic knows that overcoming the Cardinal (15-2, 1-0 MPSF) won’t be easy considering the parity and the any-given-day nature of the MPSF conference.
“Stanford is one of the most dangerous counter-attack teams in the country, so we’re going to have to work on stopping that,” Vavic said. “They’ve also got two of the best players in the country in [driver] Bret Bonanni and [utility man] Alex Bowen, so we’ve got to make sure we make clean passes through the center  and really be focused — one difference between the NorCal and SoCal tournament is that we were much more focused in those two games at SoCal.”
Bonanni and Bowen have the most career goals among active Cardinal with over 220 each. Bonanni is the Stanford’s top scorer on the 2014 season with 54 scores, while Bowen sits at third with 33 goals. USC senior driver Kostas Genidounias, who boasts 54 goals already this season, believes the key to victory in Palo Alto will be defense, as it was in Westwood.
“The mentality and the focus is going to be on defense again, like how we’ve been doing for the past couple weeks after the NorCal Tournament,” Genidounias said. “The goals are going to come by themselves on offense, so we’re going to try to figure out the best way to stop them, and that’s going to be it.”
Genidounias has provided most of the offense for the Trojans this year, but USC’s young goalie play has also been impressive. Freshman goalie McQuin Baron is averaging 10.62 saves per game and is allowing just 6.4 goals per game.
Fellow freshman goalie Ben Goncharenko has also made a few appearances, and is putting up similar numbers: 5.33 saves per game and 4.89 goals per game.
Their captain, Genidounias, whose 54 scores on the season tie him for second in the nation, continues to be optimistic yet cautious about the team’s title chances as it enters the latter half of the regular season.
“Now, all four top teams have two losses, so that makes us even — it’s like the season starts over,” Genidounias said. “[The SoCal Tournament win] gave us a lot of confidence for the rest of the season. I know everyone is excited for these two big wins [over UCLA and Cal], but we need to remain humble, we need to remain focused, we need to take each game separately and play as hard as we can.”

As the sun is at its highest point in the sky out in Temecula, California, a young woman on her family ranch mounts her horse and rides it around a dirt track. The wind wildly blows through her golden blonde hair as she makes many impressive sharp turns. This young woman happens to be senior setter Hayley Crone, and though she is known at USC for playing volleyball, her true passion lies with her horses.
Farm family · Senior setter and team captain Hayley Crone hails from Temecula, California, where her family lives on a ranch with 13 horses. – Brian Ji | Daily Trojan
Even before Crone was born, she was predisposed to liking horses.
“My mom wanted to be a vet before she was a nurse,” said Crone. “She has always loved animals and we have always had a lot of them.”
As a young girl, Crone participated in an equestrian sport called team penning, the object of which is to work as a group of three riders to get three cows into a pen within 90 seconds. What makes this sport difficult is that there are 30 cows in the arena and participants have to pen the cows that judges call out. The entire Crone family traveled throughout California to compete in this sport.
Back at the Crone’s home in Temecula, several animals roam the property including dogs, barn cats, alpacas, pigs, chickens and horses. The family has 13 horses in all, but Hayley rides only her own horse, Dominic, religiously. Her best friend and teammate, senior middle blocker Hannah Schraer, attested to how important Crone’s animals are to her.
“She takes teammates to her home and it is basically a ranch,” Schraer said. “We call it the Crazy Crone Family Farm and they always try to get me to ride a horse, but I just don’t like horses.”
Crone has an older sister, Hillary, who competed with her in team penning, and has been Crone’s rock her entire life.
“My sister is understanding, extremely patient, and we are so close,” Crone said, smiling. “She has always been my role model and I can’t even explain how much I look up to her. She has given me such unconditional support my entire life and she is such a wonderful person.”
Crone and her sister were involved in not only team penning but also dance. They were the tallest girls in their dance company and the husband of the owner asked Hillary if she would play in a volleyball match. Crone watched her sister play and was instantly hooked.
Starting in the sixth grade, Crone has played volleyball nonstop, going from grade school to club volleyball to USC. Committing at the beginning of her sophomore year to USC, Crone knew this was the place she belonged.
“A lot of my family went to USC, it’s close to home and in my opinion it is the best university ever,” Crone said. “I can’t thank Mick [Haley] and Tim [Nollan] enough for giving me the opportunity of a lifetime.”
During a recruiting trip to USC, Crone met 6-foot-3 Schraer for the first time — an encounter that marked the beginning of a lifelong friendship.
“We were on a recruiting trip and we went to a football game. We didn’t even sit next to each other,” Schraer said. “When we met it was super awkward, but she is so kind, so funny and very loyal.”
When Crone finally arrived on campus, she had no idea what a ride USC had in store for her. In her first three years on the volleyball team, she made one Final Four appearance and two regional final appearances. She also has accumulated 2,186 assists and 474 digs in those three seasons.
Even head coach Mick Haley knew he had something special when he recruited her.
“She was pretty fearless and was a dominant athlete in her age group,” Haley said. “She has always loved to play and she has a team first attitude, which you love having.”
Though volleyball has always come easy to Crone, school has always been tough. With her strong will to achieve and her fearless attitude, however, Crone made major improvements in the classroom and in 2013 was awarded Most Improved GPA at Purdue’s Mortar Board Premier.
“When I was a freshman I believed in ‘Cs get degrees’ and I didn’t care about my grades,” said Crone. “It meant a ton to me to win that award and it even impressed myself that I did that.”
As both a senior and the captain of this incredibly young volleyball team, Crone has more responsibilities now than ever before. Crone leads by example, showing teammates how this program works as well as giving them positive encouragement every step of the way.
Roughly halfway through this season, the Women of Troy are 10-6 overall. Though it wasn’t the start they wanted, they are improving in every match that they play. With Crone leading the charge, the Women of Troy hope to not only play in the NCAA Tournament but be serious contenders.
At the end of this school year, Crone will be graduating with a communication degree from the Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism. For her future, she is still deciding on whether she will join former teammates Natalie Hagglund, Sara Shaw and Alexis Olgard in playing professionally.
Though her college volleyball career will be finished soon, she will always be a part of the Trojan family and always have her horse, Dominic, by her side.

USC’s No. 22-ranked football team returns home this weekend to host the unranked Colorado Buffaloes.
Colorado is led by a young quarterback, Sefo Liufau, and wide receiver Nelson Spruce. The Buffaloes are coached by Mike MacIntyre, who was recently fined $10,000 for arguing with officials after a loss at home to Oregon State — a phenomenon Trojans know a little too well.
Daily Trojan sports editor Aubrey Kragen caught up with Jordyn Siemens, the sports editor of University of Colorado’s Independent, to give Trojan fans an idea of what to expect from the visiting Buffs.
 
Daily Trojan: Colorado quarterback Sefo Liufau took over as the Buffs’ starter midway through last season. How has he improved as a player since then?
CU Independent: Liufau has improved in three major areas this season, from what we at the CU Independent can tell.
The first is chemistry with his receivers; Nelson Spruce and Shay Fields seem to be his go-to guys down the field, but options like D.D. Goodson are also coming out of the shadows. In that sense, his ability to search for options in the pocket has slowly improved.
Second, we discovered this year that Liufau can run. With 47 rushing yards against Colorado State and 72 against Cal two weeks ago, he’s shown that he can circumvent weaknesses of our offensive line by escaping the pocket. He’s no Russell Wilson, but at least he’s trying.
Third, his accuracy is much better this year. We can attribute that to attending Peyton Manning’s quarterback camp last summer, but in reality, this improvement is more related to experience and familiarity with Coach Mac’s plays.
 
DT: Buffs wide receiver Nelson Spruce is averaging 122 receiving yards per game and is tied for the nation’s best mark with 10 touchdowns, but was held to just six catches and 35 yards last week against Oregon State. What did the Beavers do to slow him down and what can we expect to see from him on Saturday?
CUI: The Beavers were smart, watched film, recognized that Spruce was Colorado’s favorite option and doubled up on his coverage. Although they weren’t the first team to do so, Oregon State was the first to maintain double coverage of Spruce throughout the entire game, which forced the Buffs to survey second and third options more deeply than before.
I’m predicting (and hoping as a Buffs fan) that those options were a focus in practice this week, because the secret of Spruce’s talent is out, and we can’t rely on him alone anymore.
DT: USC’s redshirt junior running back Javorius “Buck” Allen is averaging 130.2 rush yards per game. How do you think Colorado’s run defense will contain the Pac-12’s rushing leader?
CUI: Honestly, Colorado’s run defense may not be able to contain Buck Allen. They’ll try hard, guaranteed, but stopping rushes has been their Achilles heel all season.
It’s comforting to know that [linebacker] Addison Gillam and [running back] Christian Powell will play again on Saturday — they’ve been recovering from concussions — but to bank on our defense is simply too risky for Colorado fans.
 
DT: Who will Colorado’s impact player of the game be?
CUI: Shay Fields. Fields has been our second-most successful receiver (257 receiving yards this year), and as I mentioned before, Spruce is guaranteed to battle heavy coverage on Saturday. Also, I’d like to think the freshman will bring his A-game to USC; he was briefly committed to the Trojans in high school before ultimately deciding on becoming a Buff.
 
DT: Prediction?
CUI: As one who bleeds black and gold, I’d love to predict a Colorado win on Saturday, but as a reporter, I don’t think a W will materialize.
The Buffs will play hard and produce a close game but should follow the all-too-familiar trend of losing by a heartbreaking margin. I’d bet on a 31-28 final.

Sometimes the most trite sports clichés are the truest, and in the case of this year’s USC football team, one in particular stands out: You’ve got to play a complete game in order to win. But in the Trojans’ last two games, I’m pretty sure they’ve tried to stray as far away from this adage as humanly possible, delivering two disastrous fourth-quarter performances.
Earlier in the season, USC brought its A-game at Stanford and battled for all 60 minutes. Late in the fourth, the Trojan defense came up huge, as junior defensive end Leonard Williams and senior linebacker J.R. Tavai sacked Cardinal quarterback Kevin Hogan on consecutive plays — the latter of which resulted in Hogan fumbling and the Trojans recovering to set up a USC victory.
Against Arizona State, though, USC entered the fourth quarter up 20-18, and choked in the end. The game was tight all the way through, with neither team holding more than an eight-point lead throughout the first three periods.
Though the Trojans trailed the Sun Devils at different points throughout the second and third quarters, it actually looked like they were beginning to pull away in the fourth. Despite USC’s recent rocky history against Arizona State and the early lead changes, I was fully confident throughout the fourth quarter that USC would win. In fact, when redshirt junior running back Buck Allen tore off a 53-yard touchdown run with three minutes to go in the game, I was so excited (and arrogant) that I ran over and hugged the ASU student standing a few seats away from me. For some reason, he didn’t seem pleased.
With USC up by nine after the extra point, students started pouring out of the stadium, sure of a Trojan victory. But then the train came off the tracks. As we’ve heard over and over again for the past two weeks, USC’s defense made big mistakes in the final minutes of the game, allowing ASU’s Cameron Smith to break away for a 73-yard touchdown reception and Jaelen Strong to haul in a Hail Mary as time expired.
USC displayed a similar lack of discipline in the fourth quarter at Arizona the next week. The Trojans entered the fourth with a 28-13 lead but gave up 13 unanswered points and got extremely lucky at the last second when Wildcat kicker Casey Skowron missed a 36-yard field goal attempt wide right with just 12 seconds to go.
In the last quarter of that game, Kessler completed just one pass for one yard. I understand pounding the rock to run out the clock while holding a 15-point lead, especially considering how in the zone Allen looked, but while Arizona was mounting a comeback, USC would have benefited from extending a couple of drives. While the Trojans put up a total of 68 yards of offense in the fourth, the Wildcats managed 190.
Perhaps more crucial than that disparity was the fact that USC committed five penalties for 34 yards in the fourth quarter. Meanwhile, Arizona committed none. The same goes for the game against Arizona State: USC had two penalties for 15 yards in the fourth, while the Sun Devils, in contrast to their name, played clean.
ESPN’s Ted Miller reported on Thursday that the Trojans have committed 21 penalties that have resulted in a first down for their opponents — more than any other team in the FBS. USC must clean up its sloppy play, from start to finish.
These fourth-quarter woes and penalties make me nervous about this Saturday’s game because I predict USC will build up a pretty big lead early on (which sets the team up to squander it down the stretch).
Colorado quarterback Sefo Liufau ranks fourth in the conference in pass yards, averaging 314.5 per game, and has some pretty dangerous targets to throw to in Nelson Spruce and Shay Fields. But despite that talent, the Buffs are winless in Pac-12 play, and their only two wins of the season came against UMass and Hawai’i.
Perhaps USC has learned from its mistakes in the past two games and has focused on playing a complete game and not losing focus late in the game. Maybe this game the Trojans will dominate throughout the fourth quarter. All I ask is that they don’t let their opponents drive down the field as time runs out. I’ve had enough stress this season.

Streaks of cardinal and gold will drape the stands of the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum Saturday at 3 p.m. as the No. 22 USC football team clashes with the Colorado Buffaloes (2-4, 0-3 Pac-12) for Homecoming.
Bounce back · Redshirt junior quarterback Cody Kessler managed just 185 passing yards and one touchdown at Arizona last weekend. The Bakersfield, California, native looks to get back on track this week against Colorado. – Ralf Cheung | Daily Trojan
 
Colorado has narrowly dropped two straight games to California and Oregon State, but wielding a dangerous aerial attack on offense, the unranked Buffs will aim to break into the conference win column as the third unranked team to knock off the Trojans this year. With injury problems looming in the USC secondary, and with issues about closing out games having surfaced, the Trojans (4-2, 3-1) will search for consistency and look to steer clear of a third upset on the 2014 season.
Dropped out of the AP poll rankings last week, USC returned to the Top 25 this week after a game-ending field goal attempt that went wide right allowed the Trojans to escape with a 28-26 win on Oct. 11 against then-No. 10 Arizona. Losing on a last-second Hail Mary touchdown and winning on an ever-fortunate missed field goal has left the Trojans bruised and once beaten, but far from broken, as head coach Steve Sarkisian likes his team’s mentality heading into Saturday.
“We’ve used a little different format here the second half of the season in our Thursday practices, in that we’re challenging the guys to be really mentally sharp,” Sarkisian said. “I think all in all the guys are in a really good frame of mind. They’re excited for the opportunity to get back out in front of our home fans at the Coliseum and put on a great show.”
The Buffs have never defeated the Trojans in the eight meetings all-time between the two sides and have struggled to keep opponents out of the end zone this season, giving up an average of 35.7 points per game.
Ranked 14th among all FBS teams in passing offense, however, the Buffs’ passing attack will keep defensive coordinator Justin Wilcox and the Trojan defense on its toes. Colorado’s sophomore quarterback Sefo Liufau has thrown 19 touchdowns on the season. Ten of those touchdowns have been caught by junior wide receiver Nelson Spruce, who Sarkisian says will demand the Trojans’ attention on defense throughout Saturday’s game.
“[Spruce] is a really versatile guy, and [the Colorado coaching staff does] a heck of a job moving him around,” Sarkisian said. “They’re putting him all over the field, not just one spot. This coaching staff did this for the last couple years with Paul Richardson, and Nelson has assumed that role of being their go-to guy, and you need to know where he is on every snap.”
Though USC did not concede a passing touchdown through the first four games of the season, stamina could determine whether or not the Trojans neutralize the Colorado air attack, as injury and fatigue have haunted the USC defense all season. Junior defensive end Leonard Williams, who dealt with an ankle injury earlier in the year, played what Sarkisian called an “astronomical” 94 snaps against Arizona last week and sat out from practice at the beginning of this week with an injured shoulder.
Both junior cornerback Kevon Seymour and freshman cornerback-wide receiver Adoree’ Jackson were sidelined by injury during the game against the Wildcats. Jackson’s hip flexor injury kept him out of practice earlier in the week as well. Jackson, Williams and Seymour all returned to practice and are expected to play in the Homecoming game. The Trojan defense will look to do a better job shutting the door in the closing stages of the game this time around against the Buffs — the Trojans’ had multiple-touchdown leads erased by late offensive surges from both the Sun Devils and the Wildcats.
On the offensive end, the Trojans will look to continue riding the hot streak of redshirt junior running back Javorius “Buck” Allen, who put the team on his back last week, rushing for three touchdowns on a career-high 205 yards against the Wildcats. Sarkisian believes Allen has developed the field vision that has put the Trojans’ running game over the top.
“[The key to running is] understanding the blocking scheme; it’s recognizing the front the defensive is in or the blitz the defense is trying to execute — really anticipating where that run is going to go — and we’re starting to see that more and more from Buck [Allen],” Sarkisian told Trojans Live. “He’s playing great. We can’t ask for more than what we’re getting out of him right now.”
Meanwhile, the Trojans will try to increase their own aerial firepower. After finding the end zone by air 10 times in the first four weeks, redshirt junior quarterback Cody Kessler has been limited to one touchdown in the last two games and threw his first interception of the year last week. Sarkisian has frequently noted the lack of explosive plays leading up to this Saturday and his desire for Kessler to launch the long ball down the field more often.
In eight meetings all-time, the Trojans have outscored the Buffs by a total of 277-76. Despite this history, the Trojans aren’t overlooking their opponents.
“[Sarkisian] said it right after we beat Arizona: ‘Next week’s another a championship game,’” sophomore linebacker Su’a Cravens said. “Colorado’s gonna give us their best shot just like every team that comes into the Coliseum does, and we have to be ready for the punches they’re about to throw.”

This letter isn’t about the play-calling or defensive schemes of our football team. There are plenty of USC Alumni and fans that have stated their strong opinions about those topics.
Rather, this is about the game day environment that unfortunately promotes the team’s lack of focus and intensity brought forth by the USC administration.
While all USC Alumni appreciate the administration for all it has done to raise funds to expand USC, at what point does this administration draw the line so we do not lose our great USC game day tradition? I’m all for staying ahead of the curve versus staying stagnant. However, how many sponsors, billboards and gimmicky activities at the Coliseum are going to be enough? It’s not as if ticket prices have come down with all the sponsorships and advertisements. The Coliseum looks like it belongs in NASCAR.
In an effort to increase attendance and sponsorships, Athletic Director Pat Haden and President Nikias have turned our Coliseum game day experience into a three-ring circus. Take the player-haircut skit during the game. The powers-that-be might have inserted this activity for the “game day experience,” but look at the players on the sidelines when this occurs. They’re all looking at the video board laughing as they watch their fellow teammates select their best haircuts. This is happening during critical times of the game.
Then there are the Player Highlights during the game. I’m not talking about replays. You’ve heard about how players shouldn’t read their own press clippings so they don’t lose focus? Well, our administration has our players looking at the video board admiring what they did just earlier instead of focusing on the next play or pumping each other up for the next play. By the way, these highlights are played during the critical times of the game, not during halftime or when the game is won.
Add now the “sounds of the game.” Like I’ve said before, do we really need to have our players look at the video board of the play-by-play commentary on what happened just moments earlier when the game is still on the line? Can you imagine Notre Dame showing highlights of their players during the fourth quarter of that famous fourth-and-9 game in 2005? Not a chance.
Remember when UCLA had their “towel-waving guy” for years? USC Alumni and fans loved that because it was another UCLA joke of LA. When UCLA head coach Jim Mora arrived, he got rid of that nonsense during his first year. Today, our coaching staff has some of the players waving yellow towels as if they’re part of the cheer squad. The issue is that it looks so manufactured. This isn’t the same as the team or coaches truly getting pumped up to encourage one another.
Finally, there’s a “game within the game.” It’s the video board/music vs. the USC Trojans Marching Band. It seems as though the administration is so focused on raising funds that it has forgotten that alumni and fans prefer to hear our beloved USC band over advertisements, sponsors and random music blaring from the speakers. It’s been a few years already since the large video board was placed at the Coliseum. Yet to this day, the administration still has not found a way to coordinate and sync up with the Spirit of Troy. The music and advertisements continue to play over the band. The USC administration has already moved the band further back from the field to garner more revenue from the “field suites.” Let’s not prioritize the video board/music over the Spirit of Troy. When the band marches into the Coliseum, let’s welcome our band and allow them to play instead of another advertisement. Play the advertisements before the band enters the Coliseum.
These circus activities do impact the fans and the players at the Coliseum. Would you want our players looking up at themselves at the video board and losing focus in a tight game or would you want them looking to our coaches and the field, focused? Stop pushing the sponsors to alumni and fans at the expense of our band.
I’m not saying that these are the reasons USC lost to Arizona State. However, football is a game of inches. It’s a difficult game that requires focus and intensity. The administration needs to do its part to help the team with this. It has created an atmosphere where players can lose intensity and in turn take the opposing team more lightly than they should. The administration is so focused on raising funds that it forgot a little bit of our USC tradition.
Attendance will grow when the team wins. Attendance will not grow based on these circus activities on game day. During Pete Carroll’s reign, fans didn’t fill the seats because of streaming music, the haircut skits or highlights made during the games. Rather, it was because the team won. So let’s go back to helping the team create a game day atmosphere of a champion instead of a Monty Python parody.
Maybe one less advertisement, one less sponsor and one less skit may lower the revenue figure on the front end. But creating a winning environment will more than make up for that “loss.” It’s been proven. Let’s not make this the modern dark ages of the ‘90s with added music, videos and sponsors.
If the administration wants to enhance game day experience for alumni and fans, put up Wi-Fi hotspots throughout the Coliseum and bring back the public address announcer, Dennis Packer.

I agree this activity during games has gotten way out of hand and the focus needs to be on the game itself, the reason we are all there or watching at home.  Please get back to the simple game day activities and stop the circus.
Oh My!!!! Could not have said it better.  People go to college football games because of the bands and the tradition, this circus is causing people to stay home.  I know this first hand and have heard it from many.  The loud sound from the vision board in row 86 on the sunny side is sometimes unbearable and don’t forget the video along the bottom of the coliseum seats.  The best home field advantage is tradition; tradition of all those who have gone before, tradition of a focused band and team, as well as an engaged crowd.  Go back to black shoes and a vision board that augments the tradition.
what a whiny Trojan, did you get ur masters at fucla?! Don’t go then, either support the school and the team and the band or head to westwood hi- some people always have to see things negative, not Trojans. We have had season tickets since I graduated in 1982, and IMHO the experience has never been better- should we bring back beer sales too? have u ben to dodger games, do you know this is 2014 and the younger generation isn’t you? well written, wtf?? these ur pals? unbelievable- do you think these kids lost because of the coli’s distractions? u obviously never played sports either, and know nothing about football. We had 75,000-80,000 out for asu! smh
I don’t see the need to attack the author personally. 
That being said, as part of the “younger generation”, most students at the games just find these little skits tacky and annoying – We’re there for the game, the skits just feel forced and aren’t actually that funny. The towel waving by the sidelines is clearly something the players have been asked to do – you don’t pump people up by holding up “cheer” signs, you give them a reason to cheer for you.
I don’t think we can blame the losses on these new additions to the coliseum, but to be honest the author’s correct. They feel cheap and being blasted with sponsors’ messages (Chevron race yada yada, SoCal dealer player of the game, etc. etc.) just detracts from the overall experience.
I don’t think we’re as bad as some programs that are basically advertisements for corporations (looking at you, Oregon and Maryland), but I don’t want us to ever get to that point. Even the shiny chrome helmets they wore for homecoming made me uneasy – USC is one of the few traditional CFB powerhouses that stuck to its guns, don’t sell out.
before you go writing about fan experience you should actually know something about it. one persons opinion is far from the voice of the people. Ridiculous to think the video board during timeouts is causing lack of focus. I’m sure all the teams around the country who do similar segments have the same “lack of focus issue”.
they also don’t play music in game so your band vs. music issue is a non-issue because it doesn’t happen. and the band is annoying playing way too much. ASk any student as I am and they will all tell you the same thing. if we were winnign you would not have written this article. stop complaining about things you cant/don’t control and support the team. if you have issues with the sponsorship  be man enough to find the right person in administration to talk to not the student paper. maybe you could learn something about fan experience and why they do what they do.
Agreed!! Excellent article. Let’s hope that the USC administration reads this and sees the big picture and the long run!!  Thank you Daily Trojan!
Best opinion piece I have read on DT in a long time.

Today’s education system seems to revolve primarily around timing and structure. In high school, college and, for some, grad school, there’s a traditional track that helps young adults fare well from an educational and self-discovery standpoint. Though traditional methods of higher education provide a good overall experience for students coming out of high school, working adults need an alternative type of education to help advance their careers and skills. The education system has already become more accessible and flexible by adding online degree options for continuing education and for working adults. Another solution that has the potential to revolutionize higher education for older students, however, is competency-based learning rather than time-based learning.
Elizabeth Cutbirth| Daily Trojan
Competency-based learning allows institutions to get student aid funding by creating experimental programs that directly measure learning, not time, which is beneficial for students who do not have the years required to attend a four-year university. This would enable students to move at their own pace and measures what students know and are able to do. According to InsideHigherEd, more than 350 institutions now have or are seeking to create programs that offer competency-based degrees. The “Flexible Option” at the University of Wisconsin currently offers five competency-based degrees. It is the first public institution permitted to offer this kind of program.
Similar to online education, these kinds of programs help to remove many of the obstacles that so often prevent aspiring adult learners from obtaining the college education and credentials they desire. According to NPR, the largest pool of current and potential college students in the United States doesn’t consist of 18- to 22-year-olds. Instead, there are millions of adults in their early 20s through late middle age who need to complete their first degree or update their skills to enhance their careers.
Supporters of competency-based education include nonprofit groups such as the Lumina Foundation, which is working to release a document called the “Degree Qualifications Profile” to provide a common basis for understanding the competencies required for an associate’s, bachelor’s or master’s degree in any field. Yet, though this kind of education has the intention of making education more worthwhile to audiences like working adults, there are some aspects of competency-based education that need to be addressed.
Competency-based education aims to help older students do college “smarter,” but there are some obstacles that competency-based programs currently face. The Department of Education recognizes that competency-based education is “new territory” and that there is no regulatory framework for it just yet. Lessons learned from the experimentation, however, will help the federal government develop better systems for encouraging innovation and new ways of learning. Specific challenges include the designing of assessments for people involved in these programs and the inability for students to create relationships with professors in the same manner.
Though this kind of education shows promise, competency-based education’s subjectivity makes it harder to create a standard of learning. Education based on time ensures standardization and structure for all students, and four-year universities should not be discounted. Though competency-based education and online education are great alternatives for those who have a “full-time life,” it is also important to consider those who are entering college straight from high school.
Beyond schooling, a four-year university enables students to have experiences like no other, fostering an environment where students learn more about themselves while pursuing an education at the same time. Competency-based education is a great and promising option for working adults, but experimentation, structure and standardization is needed before it can become a legitimate and reliable source of education for young adults just on the verge of entering the real world.

To put it nicely, the Iraq War that began in 2003 and ended in 2011 has been written into American history books as one of the most misguided and costly conflicts America has ever fought. In the last six months, issues with the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria have brought the United States back to the region to fight via airstrikes.
The collective opinion seems to be that Bush’s faults have faded into the distance, replaced by the more persistent problem of stabilizing both Iraq and Syria.
But just 72 hours ago, a report from The New York Times succeeded in shattering that collective opinion. Old wounds have reopened. The Bush administration lied about more than just the motive for invasion (weapons of mass destruction, or WMDs). According to the Times, they also lied about what they found in Iraq and what it did to our soldiers. The implications, if the story holds up, go far deeper than renewed criticism of the Bush administration: they have lessons for the here and now that go straight to the heart of the American bureaucracy and war machine.
In short, the lessons are twofold. First, the report provides more evidence that the Bush years will go down as some of the most dishonest and poorly managed in history. Second — and more importantly — it supports the need to remain incredibly vigilant and skeptical of government decisions to go to war.
In March of 2003, the United States began the first airstrikes in what would become a long war in Iraq. At the time, the American people (and the Congress that authorized the war) had believed America’s campaign to topple then-dictator Sadaam Hussein had been because Hussein possessed nuclear weapons of mass destruction.
Those weapons, it turned out, don’t seem to have existed in Iraq. The American people had been misled. The Bush administration admitted this, and acknowledged that its primary justification for war turned out to be based upon faulty intelligence. But it allegedly covered up something else:
“From 2004 to 2011, American and Iraqi troops repeatedly encountered, and at times were wounded by, chemical weapons that were hidden or abandoned years earlier,” the Times reported.
Not only was this information withheld from the public, but it was also hushed up within the military. The Times alleges that it was even withheld from soldiers who were sent to destroy the munitions, leaving them unable to receive correct medical care for the injuries they sustained as a result. Even Congress was kept mostly in the dark: Jarrod Lampier, an Army major quoted by the Times, said that he was ordered to say “nothing of significance” after more than 2,400 nerve-agent rockets were dug up in 2006.
A number of delusional folks who still believe the war in Iraq was justified will claim that the new findings prove that the Bush administration never lied about the existence of WMDs in the first place. “We found the WMDs!” they say. “Bush was right all along!”
This is a red herring to the actual criticism, and simply not factual. The Washington Post notes that all the chemical weapons were manufactured before 1991, and the Times report even discusses that most of them were not even usable as real weapons. They were simply buried in the ground and left to rot.
“The Bush administration, by contrast, staked its WMD claims on an active, on-going program that was restarted after the Kuwait conflict,” the Post wrote.
Put simply, the chemical remnants soldiers died from were in no way, shape or form the WMDs Bush was talking about. Not even close.
So Bush and company lied again, and as a result, the Iraq War’s already sordid picture in the history books has gotten even dirtier. But the real lesson in the cover-up is much broader, and it is far more significant than the exclusively “Bush lied again” narrative that you can expect from media (especially the left leaners) in the coming days. Here is what you likely won’t hear:
As Congress and President Obama continue to consider further involvement in the Middle East and elsewhere, the revelations published by the Times are reminders that any decision to go to war, and remain in war, should command intense scrutiny. Bush administration hating aside, history will repeat itself if all we get out of the Times report is that it’s another reason why Bush sucked.
The Middle East, Ukraine and the South China Sea — to name a few — are all potential hotspots for conflict. There will be pressure in the next decade to intervene. That pressure should be scrutinized by the American public. Every claim, every law and every news report needs to be closely vetted, because the next time we are asked to go to war, it could be even bigger than Iraq.
And if we make that decision the same way we made the decision in Iraq, we should shudder to think of the consequences.

Obama has done far worse than Bush….the number of scandals is unconscionable. We don’t even have time to digest one scandal before another pops up. Obama is stubborn. He should have listened to military instead of political advisors….
The article was not about Obama or Clinton or Bush Sr. or Reagan (though the warning could be applied to Obama and all future presidents). The immediate change of subject implies that (perhaps subconsciously) you agree with the writer’s assessment, and rather than even provide a logical discussion point relevant to the article, you cry out, ” Well such and such was worse.”. Which further suggests that deep down you hoping to convince yourself (using unsupported arguments from common propaganda) that what you say is true.
You infer that those who supported Bush were delusional.  (And, no doubt, many were.)
But what does that make those who supported Obama and his endless ocean of lies?  Are those people somehow excused in your mind and held to a lesser standard in your eyes?
What a load of hypocrisy.  Those who live in glass houses…
The article is not about Obama or his policies (other than a warning on future military decisions he might make), it’s about Bush and degrading chemical agents (probably mostly from the Iran-Iraq conflict) and their harm to our troops.  You know a person knows deep down that they may be wrong when the immediately change the subject.
Christopher,
I’m so glad people like you are democrats.  Makes me more at peace.
Gosh, well if the NYT writes it then it must be so.
Are you saying the Times might be lying?  How, are they misquoting the Post?  Are they misquoting Major Lampier?  Are they lying about the US now recognizing there may be problems associated with the chemicals?  Are they possibly lying about Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel ordering a review?  The article (and supporting information) seem valid to me.  Can you specify where there might be a problem?
The NYT is a business.  I know that’s shocking to you.
Like Fox News the NYT is a pawn to its readership.  Believe it or nots it (the NYT) is not some noble entity out to unveil the truth.  It’s only goal is the bottom line.  And, yes, that’s phuked up, but that doesn’t make it untrue.

In the last decade, USC has continuously championed LGBT rights, bringing rarely-discussed issues to the forefront of conversation as the university ushers in a new era of awareness and acceptance. In 2004, USC expanded its anti-discrimination policy to include “gender identity/expression.” Ten years later, in May of this year, Undergraduate Student Government passed an initiative to institute gender neutral housing options beginning in the 2015-2016 school year. And in August, Campus Pride named USC one of the top 50 most LGBT-friendly schools in America. The practice of asking for and accepting individuals’ preferred gender pronouns, or PGPs, should be the next step, then, in continuing to foster a campus-wide culture of inclusivity and respect for USC’s LGBT community.

A concept that has already gained traction at other universities, PGPs range from the traditional he/him/his and she/her/hers, to the less-common they/them/theirs, ze/hir and other preferences.
Though USC offers many resources concerning gender issues, the use of PGPs uniquely explores the macroscopic issue of gender inclusivity on the human level. For many students, especially those who have never been exposed to them before, PGPs concentrate the enormous and often confusing realm of gender issues to a simple, personal question: “What’s your PGP?” This inquiry transforms the concept of gender fluidity from an abstract theory to a tangible, personal and easily comprehensible worldview. Asking for an individual’s PGP signals respect that person’s own gender preferences instead of making the possibly hurtful or offensive assumption that he or she resides within traditional gender constructs. The process also challenges those asking for PGPs to question their own beliefs about the traditional gender framework. For those unfamiliar with the concept of gender as a spectrum, it is an opportunity to learn more about an often unspoken and yet deeply significant issue.
University campuses nationwide have already set a precedent for the use of PGPs. The University of Vermont currently allows students to list their PGPs for use on student identification cards, grade reports, directories and medical documents. The New School in New York allows students to change their PGPs in internal university records. According to its website, San José State University trains faculty to introduce themselves using their names and PGPs, and then ask for their students’ PGPs.
For many transgender students, asking for PGPs is a small practice that shows tremendous solidarity with the LGBT community. It also demonstrates the immense impact that gender assumptions can have on transgender or noncomforming students; even English speech is manufactured to reinforce the traditional gender binary.
Admittedly, asking for PGPs as part of introductions poses a small discomfort for those unfamiliar with the procedure. If people cannot change their everyday conversation to accommodate those who identify as transgender or nonconforming to gender norms, however, they can never truly be allies of the LGBT community.
Yet, concerns persist regarding the implications of implementing PGPs. For one, the practice places the burden of explaining nontraditional PGPs on those who use them. The beauty of asking for PGPs lies in its simplicity; the answer to the question “What’s your PGP?” doesn’t necessarily warrant an explanation, but could spark a conversation about gender norms if it goes further. Another concern resonates with individuals who may be uncomfortable or unwilling to share their PGPs with others. While this claim retains some merit, it is important to note that these individuals would likely be subject to traditional gender pronouns anyway, stripping them of their choice to identify — or not identify — their gender.
The next step, then, is to finally implement the process, in both training of officials and shifts in registration forms. USC should train its faculty and orientation advisers to ask for PGPs along with normal introductions in the beginning of the school year and ensure that these PGPs remain respected. And USC should allow self-identification of gender (not merely sex) in registration forms for housing and applications to the university. All changes, perhaps, are not possible, and they will certainly require perseverance and tolerance, but if USC is to further its progress as an inclusive community, administrators must start taking steps to make all students feel welcome.
Indeed, the most monumental changes, society-wide, begin on college campuses. Let’s be the college campus that not only actualizes PGPs, but also pioneers their large-scale operation. They represent, after all, the ever-expanding awareness and understanding that remain cornerstones of education.
 
This is total nonsense, and speaks to the depths of selfishness and confusion that many in today’s “me” generation have fallen to.  Gender is perhaps one of the most fundamental components of identity, founded in science, and any idea that gender falls on a “spectrum” is beyond comprehension.  The notion that a university community would indulge this lunacy poses a real threat to the fundamental role of our institutions of higher education to teach and empower young people.  
To be clear:  “Gender identity” is a problem.  It is NOT normal.  Thankfully it occurs in the smallest percentage of humanity, and we should treat those so inflicted with care, respect and compassion… But we should not indulge them by suggesting that there is any scientific basis to support genders beyond male or female.  Human sexuality is indeed a different issue, as issues of “attraction” and “behaviour” easily demonstrate.  Human sexuality exists on a broad spectrum of behavoural and identity differences.
An example of where this nonsense can lead is California’s recently established law that allows a school student to use the bathroom that corresponds to their gender “identity” or preference, rather than their actual gender.  This law is an absolute affront not only to science, but to the the majority of “normal” student who are not afflicted with any sort gender identity disorder who may not wish to share or use a bathroom with someone of the opposite gender.  This law clearly puts the “feelings” of one person above the “rights” of another.
I think society at large, and particularly those in the so-called “LGBT” community, need to remember that you can create all sorts of laws and policies that require people’s tolerance, but you can never require people’s respect or approval.  Isn’t it time we start focusing more on respect and approval, than on mere tolerance?  Isn’t the latter almost a foregone conclusion when one first earns the former?
