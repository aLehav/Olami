After 14 months of discussion among faculty, students and advisory boards from firms around Los Angeles, the Marshall School of Business has adopted a new curriculum that has received praise from many at USC.
Taking care of business · The new undergraduate curriculum at the Marshall School of Business encourages students to explore other interests. - Mike Lee | Daily Trojan 
Thirty faculty members led by Marshall’s Vice Dean for Faculty and Academic Affairs John Matsusaka spearheaded the changes to the school’s curriculum, which, according to Matsusaka, had been in place for at least 20 years.
The new curriculum reduces the number of required entry-level classes and leaves students with more space to take electives and pursue a second major or minor. It will be in place for all incoming Marshall students, and current students will have the option of switching.
“We didn’t change it because we thought it was a bad program. We changed it because we didn’t want to stand still,” Matsusaka said. “We have to keep innovating and thinking about what our students need for the future.”
According to Matsusaka, globalization is important, and students must have a global mind-set to move across disciplinary boundaries. The new curriculum increases elective space by 60 percent to allow students to do just that.
With the current curriculum, if students did not declare additional majors or minors their freshman year, many found it difficult to do so and graduate in four-years.
“I wanted to pursue a computer science minor last semester, but it would have delayed my graduation by two semesters, so I’m not even taking those classes anymore,” said Gabe Paul, a sophomore majoring in business administration.
According to Tyrone Callahan, academic director of Undergraduate Programs for Marshall, many of the foundation classes were reduced by two units to allow students to pursue interests outside of business.
“We took a hard look at the curriculum to see how efficiently we could deliver the information,” Callahan said. “It’s not entirely accurate to say that this class has been added or eliminated but that the material that is being delivered has been repackaged.”
Some students question whether the curriculum will be more difficult because fundamental classes have been condensed.
“By combining two business classes into one, it seems like there will be a lot more information to cover. I wonder if students will even have time to study for another major or minor,” said Vivek Shah, a freshman majoring in business administration.
Callahan said, however, that the new classes will not simply combine all of the material from the previous courses.
“We are eliminating some of the introductory material that isn’t relevant to our students’ future studies. We want our students to learn exactly what is essential,” Callahan said.
For incoming freshman who have interests outside of Marshall, the new curriculum is especially attractive.
“I’m actually really excited about this because I know that a lot of students, including myself, don’t know exactly what we want to do after college, and this gives us a lot of wiggle room to pursue our interests,” said Sam Simmons, an incoming freshman who will be majoring in business administration.
Courtney Rava, an incoming freshman who will be majoring in business administration, agreed.
“It’s great that the business school will better allow students to minor because I want to get everything that I can out of school,” Rava said.
Though current students may switch to the new curriculum next semester, Callahan said the change would not be convenient for rising seniors and juniors who would need to take additional classes to fulfill the requirements. For rising sophomores, however, Callahan said that they should meet with their advisers to determine which course plan works best.
Since upperclassmen most likely will not utilize the new curriculum, some said they find the program bittersweet.
“It’s nice to know that the university is taking steps to change, but it leaves a sour taste for some students who wish they could have minored or taken more advantage of other classes offered at USC,” said Mario Portugal, a senior majoring in business administration.
Other students agreed.
“[The new curriculum] will definitely be great for the school if it yields better students from USC and increases the value of a USC degree,” said Alex Noon, a junior majoring in business administration. “Even though I won’t have this new curriculum, I still gain some benefit by going here. Maybe not tomorrow or the next couple of years, but the curriculum will make [all Marshall graduates] look better.”
Though Marshall has recently been ranked in the top 10 for its undergraduate program by U.S. News & World Report, Matsusaka said it was important for the school to continue improving and that the new curriculum will be a selling point for USC.
“Ultimately, our students will have a very strong grounding in business and strong depth in some area outside of business, which will create what we feel is important for creating the business person of the future,” Matsusaka said.
Certain b-school classes, like OB, need to be eliminated. I think a far better alternative would be an IR, sociology or pscyh class that’s geared toward themes like “workplace diversity,” “anti-violence at the workplace in the 21st century,” and the likes. OB seems like such an artificial, wannabe-discipline that was pulled out of thin air. You don’t care to remember like 99% of the material after you’re done with the class, because maybe it’s so boooring.

The LGBT and Allies community will conduct focus groups for undergraduates Tuesday and Wednesday evening in an effort to improve its resources and services on campus.
“We’re trying to find strategies to truly reflect what students want so we can move forward every academic school year,” said Vincent Vigil, director of the USC Lesbian Gay Bisexual Transgender Resource Center.
The focus groups are part of a two-tier approach to obtaining feedback on LGBT resources. The first step was a 17-question LGBT perception survey, available at the resource center’s website for faculty, staff and students.
The events are a joint effort between the LGBT Resource Center, a department of student affairs, and the Gay, Lesbian, Bisexual & Transgender Assembly, a student-run organization that is part of Program Board.
Vigil introduced the idea of focus groups in 2007 as a way to better represent students’ opinions and perceptions of the LGBT community. Vigil emphasized that the organizers are interested in ideas from both students who are part of the LGBT community and students who are not.
“The only way to stay at the cutting edge of what students want is to hear directly from them,” he said.
The focus groups will be moderated by a graduate student and will include a tape recorder and a student note taker. Participants, who will not be asked their name or year, will answer questions about their experience with LGBT events at USC. The questions range from how well-represented LGBT students feel to possible community outreach strategies.
“I’ve been to five or so [focus groups], and it’s a really friendly environment,” said Joshua Morris, a junior majoring in psychology and the incoming assistant executive director for GLBTA. “It’s completely anonymous, so no one’s afraid to speak out. Your name won’t be there, but your message will be heard.”
According to Vigil, student feedback from the focus groups has had tangible effects on LGBT events and organizations.
“Last year, students said they wanted more education about LGBT community organizations around Los Angeles so we hosted the LGBT College Fair and an intercollegiate college mixer with UCLA and the L.A. Gay and Lesbian Center,” he said.
In 2008, the surveys indicated a desire for more resources for the transgender community. Now, the LGBT Resource Center’s website includes a list of local transgender-friendly physicians, and several campus buildings have gender-neutral bathrooms.
One of several students planning to attend this year’s focus groups is Michael Salvatore, a sophomore majoring in fine arts and anthropology.
“I’m glad they’re holding the focus groups because there are a lot of different interests within our community,” Salvatore said. “GLBTA is a strong social space, but there are other ways for people who are just coming to terms with their sexuality to take advantage of the LGBT resources than just social events.”
Though this week’s focus groups are open only to undergraduates, GLBTA and the LGBT Resource Center will conduct focus groups for graduate students April 6 and focus groups for faculty and staff April 8.
“I’m hoping students come out to the focus groups regardless of their involvement level within our community,” Vigil said. “I want them to voice their opinions and provide new insights and ideas that continue to help us to innovate and create programs and services that are tailored to them.”
The focus groups will take place Tuesday at 8 p.m. in Parkside International Residential College in room 1016 and Wednesday at 8 p.m. in the Birnkrant Residential College first-floor lounge.

Jenny Novak, a second-year graduate student studying geography, was elected president of the Graduate and Professional Student Senate at Monday night’s GPSS meeting.
Ready to serve · Jenny Novak, a second-year graduate student studying geography and the current campus affairs chair for GPSS, was elected president of GPSS on Monday. - James Watson | Daily Trojan 
Novak, GPSS’ current campus affairs chair, won a large enough majority of the senators’ votes to avoid a run-off. She beat out Edward Ng, a first-year graduate student studying public policy and urban planning, and Juanita Price, a first-year graduate student studying education.
Novak said one of her main goals is spreading awareness of GPSS.
“The most important thing for us is to focus on in the beginning is publicity … so the entire university community knows about GPSS and so the graduate students know what a resource we can be for them,” Novak said.
Her long-term goals include establishing a subsidized transit system, continuing her work on improving sustainability and ensuring a first-year housing guarantee for graduate students, she said.
“We want to make sure that our graduate students are getting the adequate space so that we can have students living closer to the community, at least in their first year here,” she said.
Novak also hopes to ensure that the graduate student lounge in the new Ronald Tutor Campus Center promotes interdepartmental relationships and helps accomplish other GPSS goals.
Aliya Yousufi, a second-year graduate student studying law and the current GPSS vice president, was elected for a second term as vice president.
Yousufi, who ran unopposed, told the senators at the meeting Monday, “This year, I want to do a lot more.”
Yousufi said she has a number of plans to use surplus funding currently unused by graduate students. She hopes to give all students access to the conference fund, which provides funding for students to attend conferences but is currently limited to certain departments, and to re-establish the professional development fund.
“I’m going to be working with the finance chair to create a professional development fund for graduate student to help with networking and job hunting,” she said.
Irfan Elahi , a current member of the GPSS Finance Committee and a graduate student studying business, was elected to serve as the finance chair.
Elahi proposed increased efficiency, complete transparency and the expansion of the endowment fund. Like Yousufi, he said he would like to revamp the conference fund and add a senator development fund to take advantage of the extra funding GPSS has available.
Rosezetta Upshaw, a second-year law student, ran unopposed for Community Service Chair and was elected to serve her second year on the GPSS executive board. She began her involvement as a senator two years ago and currently serves as the elections and recruitment chair.
“I don’t want to reinvent the wheel; I want to use GPSS resources to put extra air in those tires that are already rolling,” Upshaw said. “I want to collaborate across disciplines more because my vision is really to bring the campus together.”
She plans to offer visits to more schools and detention centers to take on a more visible role in the community.
“We’re known for the social programming, the grad bar; we’re known as a bank to come get funding, but I also want us to be known as being active in the community,” Upshaw said. “If we’re all doing service together, if we’re all in the community making a difference, that’s the perfect way to build ourselves as an organization, to make connections across disciplines.”
I’m disappointed this article did not mention Johannes Schmitt, the departing president.  This guy is a great Trojan and a great person all-around.  We will miss you as GPSS President, Johannes.  Stay cool.
I just wanted to make a quick correction to this article. The Conference Travel Fund is has ALREADY been opened up to all departments this year (where as before, cinema, music, theater, education, law and business were not able to apply). However, it is correct that I will be working on creating a new Professional Development Fund in the coming year.

“There’s a power in not seeing,” Ira Glass, host of radio show This American Life, said while in complete darkness on the stage of UCLA’s Royce Hall. “There is an intimacy to just hearing. You feel something more, or different at least.”
Raconteur · Ira Glass has hosted NPR’s This American Life for 15 years. - Gary Fung | Daily Trojan 
Radio, in Glass’ mind, is a great format for storytelling for this very reason — and he should know. After working for the National Public Radio since he was 19 and hosting This American Life — which has become arguably their most popular show — for the network’s past 15 years he understands how to tell a compelling story in a seemingly effortless manner.
But Ira Glass is a perfectionist. Forty-five minutes before “A Night with Ira Glass: Radio Stories and Other Stories” was to start, he was still rewriting the opening of the show. After starting each broadcast with the same lines for the last 15 years, he wanted to do something new.
Before Glass entered, the stage was sparse. There was only a desk with sound equipment and a KCRW sculpture in front of it. Two spotlights illuminated the background.
Over a decade prior, Glass did his first live show for This American Life on the same Los Angeles stage presented by the same radio station, KCRW. But back then, the show was “very low-rent,” according to current KCRW general manager Jennifer Ferro.
The Ira Glass of that first show was not the “alpha male of the beta males” as one reporter described him, but rather was a confident stage presence. And since its first live show, This American Life has impacted film, television, books and even politics.
This time, Glass was performing to a sold-out venue, with each audience member hanging on his every word as he spoke about his radio show and life in general while playing audio and music clips to illustrate his points. Glass was like a conductor in his movements, pushing buttons on the soundboard and motioning with his hand, stopping just as the music stops.
“I’ve never seen your local news here in Los Angeles, but since you’re in the United States of America, I’ll assume it’s crap,” he said while speaking of the differences between most broadcast news programs and what he tries to do on This American Life.
Glass attempts to blur the lines between what is serious news and what is funny, unlike most prestigious news shows. Whereas they try to “sell gravitas,” Glass said he tries to sell reality and all aspects of it. Not only the horrors but also the “pleasure, surprise, humor and joy” that make the world and life so worthwhile. He tries to make the show fun and personable, almost like a conversation with a friend.
“Radio works best when it mimics regular conversation,” Glass said of a rule of good storytelling. “The telling of the story is more interesting than the events themselves.”
It is important to have moments of reflection interspersed with the action, which, unlike most other media, is explicit in radio. The ability to build suspense, to make the listener want to know the destination of a series of events, is what makes a gripping narrative. These tactics, he noted, are very akin to those used in sermons.
“Jesus’ sermons in the Bible are this structure,” Glass said. “Now we live in a time in which we are constantly inventing new methods of bringing narrative to us.”
Though we are more inundated with stories than ever before, Glass lives for the ability to truly see inside someone’s experience through a story. That exact moment of connection is what he believes radio is capable of creating. And because narrative is so powerful, it is extremely important as a basic human function.
“These are tools you can use to save your life,” Glass said, citing the classic Persian tale One Thousand and One Arabian Nights as an example.
Scheherazade, a character in the story, uses suspense and the king’s desire to know each story’s end, to save her life. Each dawn, when the king would have ordinarily killed her, he is instead so intrigued by the story she is telling him that he spares her for another day and this continues for 1,001 nights until he is finally able to learn empathy and decides to spare her life. For Ira Glass, this exemplifies the power and purpose of storytelling — it creates empathy.
After so many years working on the show, Glass is still excited about his job, even more so since he asked Showtime to stop the T.V. version of the show after only two seasons. Now they’re doing much more ambitious projects on the radio, which he says are “format breaking [and] incredibly fun.”
Last week, Glass said he had gotten almost no sleep from working on a project. Each night he would wake up half an hour earlier than the night before, his body telling him, “Get up! Go to work!” Glass said the idea for now is just to focus on radio, but in a new, even more compelling way. Though for Glass, it just might save his own life.
“I don’t have any other special talent,” he said.
This American Life is not produced by NPR. Please update the photo caption — it’s produced at Chicago Public Radio and distributed by Public Radio International.Thanks.

With an area population of nearly 10 million, it’s easy to focus on some of Los Angeles’ more beautiful and prestigious residents. But Broken, written by J. Matthew Nespoli, takes a look into the morbid lives of the underrepresented and unlucky.
Nespoli’s novel follows 14 individuals whose lives of constant struggle somehow become intertwined. Although Broken gives numerous different perspectives of dreaming through despair, it feels that some perspectives are not entirely necessary. The conflicts and backgrounds of several characters aren’t all that unique in relation to each other.
Take characters Dylan and T.J., for instance. Both start out with low-paying jobs and never really succeed in their goals of being a writer and an actor, respectively. Both characters essentially feel the same about their positions and seem to represent the same failed spirit as they strive to find love in the world and fix their miserable lives.
The book becomes convoluted by all of the despondent characters, several of whom play nearly similar roles.
Beth, a pregnant girl with two gay fathers, and Amber, a lesbian stripper who was raped years earlier, provide a more contrasting pair. Amber helps take care of Beth as an older sister would, while Beth tries to find a source of income.
Eventually, Beth bears a child named Jonathan and she and Amber — who already has a young daughter named Kimberly — have to deal with raising their children without father figures. At this point, many of the contrasts between Beth and Amber are lost.
Broken does, however, succeed in presenting a detailed and vivid image of how the characters’ seemingly simple lives can be both tedious and dramatic.
Skye, for example, is a heroin addict who was raped by her father as a child and continues to suffer from this experience. While her life revolves largely around drugs and attempts at rock stardom, it is sad to see her never-ending struggle with addiction play out. Even after the book’s climax where she finally decides to go cold turkey and suffers through days of withdrawal, Skye eventually returns to drugs.
Nespoli’s writing style is easy to follow, and, with constant references to films and familiar media, Broken is definitely written for a contemporary generation. He also spares no details on what the characters feel, both physically and emotionally — no matter how unsettling it might be.
Nespoli’s characters dwell on unresolved issues and regret earlier life decisions, making the characters believable.
The common thread between the characters, however, is that they all wallow in self-hatred, self-pity and otherwise melancholy images of themselves. Most of the conflicts in the book are based around sex, love and drugs. And to some extent, this limits the scope of the narrative.
Because it is written in first person through each character, the reader is never removed from Nespoli’s dreary perceptions of life. This creates a theme of depression — as the book’s title suggests — though it would have been nice if these views were contrasted against more hopeful moments.
In some instances, the characters find themselves dealing with the more successful individuals of Los Angeles. Early on, Dylan is introduced as working at a restaurant called Crustaceans in Beverly Hills. Through his eyes, the rich and wealthy are shallow and morally void.
This seems to be the case in the story, as exemplified by Jackson, a wealthy, retired professional football player. He is the man who impregnated Beth after a one-night stand and seems capable of only lustful love. As with the other characters, he is emotionally damaged.
By the end of the book, there is some resolution, and a few of the troubled characters have fixed things in their life. As with any dramas, it seems their lives could hit obstacles further in the future. Nespoli, after all, doesn’t simply give these characters single-path lives.

Sheltered from the brutal late afternoon sun by a canopy of leafy trees, E.F. Hutton Park and Founders Park provided a very un-USC-like setting for the second annual KSCR Fest on Sunday. In fact, the event felt more like an off-campus music festival as curious music lovers and ardent band supporters flocked to the grassy Annenberg Amphitheater and lounged on picnic blankets, smoked cigarettes and indulged in a talented set list of bands. 
Opening the festivities at 4 p.m. was the four-man student band, The Smiles. The energetic quartet admitted to a surprisingly large early crowd that it was abandoning its planned acoustic set for a more lively performance.
A group of admiring fans gleefully danced along as The Smiles proceeded to treat the audience to an infectious set of sunny pop-rock tunes. Its closing song “Coca-Cola,” a toe-tapping tribute to the sugary soft drink, drew enthusiastic applause that rivaled any received by the following acts.
Though the music festival is only in its second year, staff members of the student-run radio station, KSCR, could not have been more pleased with the improvements made over last year’s show and the event’s increasing popularity.
Sponsored raffles for music, movie posters and books were held throughout the night. Thirsty fans gravitated toward the tent sponsored by Vitaminwater to wash down free chilled refreshments while D.J.s from both KSCR and Dublab contributed to the event’s palpable energy in between performances.
“We have definitely improved our promotion campaign for the event, especially online and on the airwaves,” said Zachary Wolf, KSCR general manager and a senior majoring in English and minoring in music industry. “The students at KSCR put this all together. They’re the ones that run the show. We’re really pleased to see a lot more people here this year at the beginning of the show to see the acoustic sets. That’s really a testament to all the hard work that the students have put into this show’s promotion and preparation. We love introducing people to new music, and its great that students can come see these performances for free.”
KSCR D.J. Alex Yen, a sophomore majoring in art history, seconded Wolf’s thoughts on the benefits of the locally themed music festival.
“It’s a really good show since we can showcase a lot of awesome local bands,” Yen said. “The Smiles are an excellent example of a band that can benefit greatly from the KSCR Fest. Our venue allows for a lot more people to be introduced to their music and come watch them perform than if they just played at Ground Zero.”
For the majority of the bands, it was a welcome sight to be playing in front of a hometown crowd. After learning of Rumspringa’s cancellation earlier in the week, Chasing Kings jumped at the chance to play at KSCR Fest after returning from last week’s South by Southwest Music Festival in Austin, Texas.
“This is our first show back where we can smell the Pacific Ocean, and it’s a beautiful day,” proclaimed Chasing Kings’ lead singer Matt Schwartz after the group played its first song.
The alternative rock band’s passionate performance impressed concertgoers. Many newly converted fans swarmed the band’s table to purchase its EP after listening to the set of stomping beats, rattling keys and crunchy guitar riffs.
As the night progressed, the diversity of musical talent present at the KSCR Fest was met with varying degrees of enthusiasm. The British pop-rock-influenced Princeton was decidedly distant to its audience and its performance was met with an equally reserved response from the crowd.
Once the sun set, attendees moved toward the stage like flies to a porch light. The grunge-infused psychedelic surf rock of the aptly named the Growlers piqued the crowd’s attention, and  though there was not a fog machine in sight, the mass of fans sat in a smokey haze.
The combination of reggae-influenced bongo drums and guitars with lead singer Brooks Nielsen’s rough-as-sandpaper vocals resulted in a much-deserved encore performance. The Oh Sees and The Entrance Band were also huge hits. Trance-inducing guitar solos and atmospheric wails gave The Entrance Band a Zeppelin-esque quality to their performance.
With the event’s increasing popularity in just its second year, the KSCR Fest could benefit from a move to the more accommodating McCarthy Quad. However, its free admission and wide variety of music make it a welcome campus concert addition for those students waiting for Springfest in April.

Despite initial reports that indicated USC’s redshirt junior tailback Marc Tyler would be unavailable for the start of spring practice, it now appears as if the redshirt junior running back will in fact be prepared to partake in spring drills this week despite undergoing toe surgery earlier this year.
According to Michael Lev of the Orange County Register, Tyler claims to be “90 percent” healed, and as a result, will do whatever is necessary to be on the field when practice kicks of this week. While USC has not issued an official statement clearing Tyler to practice, the running back appears more than ready to partake in team activities on Tuesday.
“I cleared myself,” Tyler told the media last Thursday. “I’m clear. … I feel good.”
A healthy Tyler would go a long way into shoring up some of the Trojans’ concerns at the running back position, particularly in the wake of the departure of 1000-yard rusher Joe McKnight, who declared for the NFL Draft in January.
His return would certainly help the junior make his case for more playing time in the fall.
In his only appearance on the field last season against San Jose State, Tyler ran for 72 yards on 5 carries (14.4 average) highlighted by a short touchdown run from off the bench.
Tyler came to USC as a 5-star recruit from Oaks Christian High School in Westlake Village, California where he scored 31 touchdowns, averaged 12.2 yards per carry, and was a USA and Parade All-American.

The Los Angeles Unified School District and school employee unions agreed to a proposal that would cut five days from the academic calendar this year, according the Los Angeles Times.
The proposal is now awaiting approval by the teachers and administrators unions.
Beyond this year, the proposal would cut seven days from the next school year and force employees to take a temporary pay cut.
The move, proponents argued, is necessary to avoid laying off 2,100 employees in the district. In addition to saving jobs, the proposal, if passed, would reduce spending by $140 million. The district already faces a $640 million deficit.
District officials expect the teachers and administrators unions to approve the plan since it maintains current class sizes and saves jobs.
A.J. Duffy, president of the teachers union, has said that the proposal is palatable in that the pay cuts are only temporary.
“If it’s a fair deal, we’re willing to take furlough days,” Duffy told the Times.
Earlier this month, the district sent layoff notices to nearly 5100 employees.
Duffy, however, remains optimistic that most, if not all, of the teachers would be able to return to the classroom.
LAUSD serves just short of 700,000 students and employs nearly 45,000 teachers and another 38,000 classified employees.

Despite her recent best actress win at the Oscars, Sandra Bullock has faced devastating marital woes in the foreground of camera flashes, outshining what was supposed to be a momentous occasion in her career.
The story plays out like your typical Hollywood cliché: On her upward climb to Academy success, the beautiful A-list actress spends months away from home on the set of her Oscar-buzzed film. On the other hand, her husband — bored and bitter — finds comfort in an alleged adulterous affair. In recent years relationship turmoil has plagued other silver screen starlets such as Halle Berry.
The news of Bullock’s romantic misfortunes are part of a greater social commentary. What has been referred to in Tinseltown as the “best actress curse” is more than a decade of female winners suffering from relationship troubles immediately after accepting their trophies.
So what seems to be the problem?
The underlying theme is the inner-relationship competition between husbands and their more accomplished, more famous wives. Though they should be outdated in today’s 21st century culture, existing social constructs still identify men as the breadwinners in a typical American household, in spite of great progress for women, as evidenced in an increasingly diverse professional landscape.
“It’s sad, but true, that in this day and age it’s a rare treasure of a man who can handle being married to a hugely successful woman — especially one who’s more successful at the current time than they are,” said Bonnie Fuller, the editor-in-chief of HollywoodLife.com. She indicated that when success levels are unequal, the decline in mutual support is often a consequence.
Alissa Masutani | Daily Trojan
Sympathizing with these betrayed wives, we as a society have become more and more harsh on those who are found out to be unfaithful, in part because of the greater availability of information that is leaked to public.
Over the past couple of decades, we’ve seen the development of a blanket sentiment of gender equality, in which both men and women are assumed to be equal across all walks of society — personally, professionally and otherwise. The thought of a woman surpassing her husband in her career is no longer an archaic idea but instead a healthy example for people still stuck with an opposite mentality.
It might be pure coincidence that there have been so many failed relationships following award success for women; assuming a direct relationship would be reckless. However, the strong correlation seems to hint at a disappointing trend.
In a place as progressive as Hollywood, you would expect its biggest players to practice this ideal, especially in the setting of marriage. Then again, marriage hasn’t always been this industry’s strong suit.
Myth or reality, as far as becoming a more gender equal society, we all have got some way to go.
Christopher Agutos is a junior majoring in political science and public relations.  His column “Pop Life” runs every other Tuesday.
Best Actress Curse??? Just because two actresses have had trouble with relationships after they accept the Oscar does not warrant a curse. There is no “strong correlation” as you suggest, so you are right when you say its “pure coincedence”. Do a little more research on Jesse James and you’ll find he’s had a lot more trouble with sleeping around in the past. This was not caused by a wife that was more successful than him, it was simply cause by a man who likes to sleep around…Seriously how many times has he been in sex rehab??? 
1. To the author- DO A LITTLE MORE RESEARCH!
2. Maybe because you could never be overshadowed by a significant other doesnt mean you should take it out on society.
The “feminists” have to got to get their hysteria a little more consistent. So now you’re saying, “gender equality” means people will be faithful in marriage? I thought gender “progress” meant that monogamy was old-fashioned, patriarchal, oppressive, etc, and that “gender equality” meant both sexes should be promiscuous with strangers! Could it be that “feminists” are coming around to see some benefits in traditional values?

The USC baseball team looks to rebound from its disappointing weekend series loss to No. 19 Stanford this afternoon when it takes on the Loyola Marymount Lions at George Page Stadium at 3 p.m.
Ready to go · Senior pitcher Shuhei Fujiya has used the first portion of the season to slowly work up his pitch count to join the USC rotation. - Avi Kushlan | Daily Trojan 
Senior pitcher Shuhei Fujiya is almost fully stretched out after throwing 50 pitches in his last outing Friday against Stanford and will start his first game of the season for USC (12-12, 1-2). Fujiya has compiled a 3-1 record in his eight relief appearances. He has a 5.11 ERA in 12 and one-third innings with 10 strikeouts. In his three-inning relief appearance against Stanford, he allowed one run on four hits and struck out two.
“We think he’s pitched well enough recently to warrant a start,” said USC coach Chad Kreuter.
Opposing Fujiya will likely be Lions (13-11) freshman Aaron Griffin, although LMU has not officially made a decision. The right hander has pitched to an ERA of 7.94 in eight appearances with 12 strikeouts this season, including two starts. In his most recent start against Cal State Fullerton last week, Griffin pitched a complete game, allowing seven hits and two runs, while striking out five.
LMU heads into the matchup fresh off a four-game sweep of Albany over the weekend at George Page Stadium. The Lions have won 10 of their last 11 games, including five consecutively.
The Lions are batting .295 as a team with a 5.44 staff ERA, compared to the Trojans’ .298 team batting average and 4.72 ERA.
Kreuter admits that LMU might not be as deep as a Pac-10 challenger, but he still feels that the Lions are a tough team on their quirky home field, which sports a close fence in left field with a high wall, similar to Fenway Park’s Green Monster.
“The field plays different, and we need to be able to adjust,” Krueter said. “Our outfielders need to be able to make plays, and our pitchers need to pitch away from that side of the field. We need to prepare for it both mentally and physically.”
Lions junior leadoff man Jonathan Johnson paces LMU with a .351 average, 23 runs scored, six stolen bases and 33 hits, including four triples. Redshirt sophomore catcher Matt Koch leads the Lions with eight home runs, 21 RBI and 10 doubles. He is hitting .301 on the season.
Although USC is coming off a tough opening Pac-10 series loss to Stanford last weekend, Kreuter isn’t looking at this afternoon’s game with any extra sense of urgency. He said his team needs to approach every game the same way.
“Every win is important. Every win is a must. Every game in college baseball is like a playoff schedule,” he said. “We need to win in conference and out of conference as much as possible.”
Kreuter also said his team needs to improve its pitching in the later innings of games and give up fewer runs with two outs and opposing runners in scoring position.
“For me it’s about staying focused, making adjustments,” he said. “We’re heading in the direction of making those adjustments.”
Kreuter better believe these games are urgent if he wants to save his job. Thought the team had the pitching guru Tom House with all his degrees and major league experience. They have been heading in the same direction for four years playing .500 ball week after week.

With very little doubt in my mind, I can strongly say that this is the best March Madness that I’ve ever watched.
I doubt you know a single person who picked a Final Four of Butler, Michigan State, West Virginia and Duke.
And I doubt you’ve seen very many NCAA tournament games that can match the thrill and excitement that Kansas State-Xavier provided Thursday evening.
But there’s a part of me that wants more.
As everyone knows, the USC men’s basketball team didn’t get a chance to participate in this year’s tournament.
USC probably wouldn’t have made the tournament even if it hadn’t been under self-declared sanctions that banned it from playing beyond the regular season, but as last season proved, anything can happen in the Pac-10 tournament.
The Trojans won the 2009 Pac-10 championship and rode a hot streak into the NCAA tournament that was exhilarating for any Trojans fan to watch.
But this season, USC never had the chance to recapture any of its Pac-10 tournament magic.
And truly, even if they had found a way to sneak into the NCAA tournament, it is hard to tell just how far a team that had an up-and-down season would have gone.
But, just for a second, imagine a perfect Trojans’ basketball world, in which USC is home to one of the best teams in the country and has the best starting five the Galen Center has ever seen.
It would look something like this: at point guard, senior Daniel Hackett; at shooting guard, junior O.J. Mayo; at small forward, sophomore DeMar DeRozan; at power forward, junior Davon Jefferson; and at center, senior Taj Gibson.
Those are the best five USC men’s basketball players that I have seen grace the Galen Center court in my tenure here at USC, which will sadly come to an end in May.
This year, technically, they’d all still have eligibility to play for the Trojans, if, in that perfect Trojans’ basketball world, they all decided to stay in college and not opt early for the NBA.
And what a team it would have been.
That bunch would likely have been one of the best starting fives in the country this year if they had stayed.
Now, I know those days are long gone. Long gone.
But, for a second, just imagine that lineup on the basketball court this year.
Imagine that team playing in March Madness, off-court scandals aside.
Imagine those guys’ hoisting a championship trophy at the NCAA tournament’s end.
Now, wipe the drool away from your mouth because it’s not reality.
I understand that athletes have every right to spend one or two years in college and then jump to the NBA to make millions of dollars, but it doesn’t mean I have to like the idea, especially when it comes at the expense of a potentially fantastic USC squad.
If I were NBA Commissioner David Stern, I would try to set up a system where a player could earn more money in the draft based on how many years he stayed in college. The longer a player stayed in the NCAA, the more money he could earn on draft day.
That might give players more incentive to stay in college and allow mediocre programs like USC a chance to actually build a team rather than be susceptible to the one-and-done stars like Mayo and DeRozan.
That team above could have been the best in USC history, filling up the Galen Center night after night.
If you didn’t make it out to any basketball games this season — which wouldn’t be all that surprising — you wouldn’t have been seen that the Galen Center was anything but packed during games. It’s a beautiful arena that could have been the home of an incredible team.
It just wasn’t meant to be.
But hey, a Trojans fan can dream of a USC dream team, can’t he?

You must have transferred here…. because if you were here for your freshman year then you would know who Nick Young is. But you clearly don’t…

He plays in the same arenas NBA players play in. He wears a uniform similar to the ones NBA players wear. But former USC point guard “Smilin’” Gabe Pruitt does not play in the NBA.

After two seasons for the Boston Celtics, Pruitt now is a member of the Utah Flash in the NBA Development League, the NBA’s official minor league.
“Down here [in the NBDL], it is really competitive,” Pruitt said in an interview before a game against the Los Angeles D-Fenders at the Staples Center. “In the NBA, you have guys that have already made it. But here guys are fighting every night to compete to get to the NBA. Every night, you have someone coming after you.”
Since his time at USC, Pruitt’s career has had ups and downs, but he has not lost his trademark smile.
As a freshman at USC, Pruitt made an immediate impact, leading the Trojans in scoring. The next year, he was named to the All-Pac-10 first team. As a junior, Pruitt helped the Trojans reach the Sweet Sixteen in the NCAA tournament.
Pruitt declared for the NBA Draft after his junior year and was drafted in the second round by the Celtics. Playing alongside NBA All-Stars Ray Allen, Kevin Garnett and Paul Pierce, Pruitt experienced winning an NBA title as a rookie.
“It was my first time really moving and living by myself 3,000 miles away,” Pruitt said. “I wasn’t used to the cold weather, but once I got settled, those were some of the best days I have had playing basketball. I was around a lot of great veterans that took care of me and took me under their wings.”
Away from basketball, however, Pruitt made an unflattering appearance on the reality television show Bad Girls Club and was arrested on suspicion of drunken driving.
“Off the court, there is always somebody looking at you, no matter where you are,” Pruitt said. “You have to make the right decisions off the court because you never know who is around, and you do not want to be an embarrassment to yourself, as well as to your family and your team. Me being so young, I got caught up in living the lifestyle of the NBA, but I learned from that. Now I am more cautious with what I do.”
This season, the Celtics did not choose to re-sign Pruitt. The New York Knicks signed him but waived him before the season started, leading Pruitt to join the NBDL.
Since signing with the Flash, Pruitt has worked extensively with head coach Brad Jones and assistant coach and former Laker Mark Madsen.
“[Pruitt] is a terrific young player,” Jones said. “People ask me if he is a point guard or a [shooting] guard, but I tell them he is a playmaking guard. When he is focused, he can be one of the better players in our league and shows that he has a chance to get back to the NBA.”
Pruitt echoed the sentiments of his coach.
“I need to give a consistent effort every night,” Pruitt said. “[Celtics head coach] Doc [Rivers] always told me that he knew I could score, so that is not the issue. I need to be a leader, a point guard, and show that I can run a team being a young guy and playing with veterans like Kevin Garnett.”
The benefits of playing in the NBDL do not compare to those in the NBA. Players play in front of smaller crowds, travel in crowded commercial airplanes and make far less money. Yet, Pruitt still smiles and practices intensely in hopes of returning to the NBA.
“It is up to me to continue to work hard and do what I need to do to get back up there,” he said.
Another player who would have been better off staying for his senior year although believe there was grade problems  involved.

The No. 13 USC men’s swimming and diving team finished 11th overall at the NCAA championships at Ohio State’s McCorkle Aquatic Pavilion, topping off its season with strong improvements both as a team and as individual members.
Group effort · Sophomore James White teamed up with senior Zoltan Povazsay, junior Emmett Walling and sophomore Jeff Daniels to finish this weekend’s 400-yard freestyle relay in 2:54.88, good enough to place 12th overall. The foursome nearly set a school record in the preliminaries. - Katelynn Whitaker | Daily Trojan 
“While we fell a bit short of our goal of top 10 this season for the men, we clearly are making inroads toward breaking into the top 10 with an eye on the top five soon,” said USC coach Dave Salo.
The competition’s start was delayed 24 hours, as 18 student-athletes and one coach were being treated at Ohio State for a possible gastrointestinal illness Tuesday and Wednesday.
When the event kicked off Friday, junior Clement Lefert led the team by finishing third in the 500-yard freestyle with a 4:13.77. Lefert had a comfortable lead throughout the race until the final 50 yards, where he was overtaken by Conor Dwyer of Florida (4:13.64) and Jean Basson of Arizona (4:13.65); a mere .13 seconds separated the top-three finishers. This marked USC’s best performance in the 500-yard freestyle at the NCAA championships since Olympic medalist Larsen Jensen won the event in 2007.
“Clement did his thing and almost won the 500,” USC assistant coach Jeremy Kipp said. “But he also gained incredible experience that will help him contend next season for the 500 title.”
Junior Richard Charlesworth made the consolation final in the 500-yard freestyle and came in eighth in his race with a time of 4:23.88 (16th overall). That time was, however, four seconds slower than his preliminary performance (4:19.09).
Sophomore diver Harrison Jones just missed qualification for the 1-meter springboard final after finishing ninth in the preliminaries (364.20). He went on to finish tied for seventh in the consolation final with a score of 355.15, to tie for 15th overall. Jones also just missed out on making the final in platform but ended up winning the consolation final and finishing ninth overall with 376.40 points.
“Despite illness into the last day of competition, Harrison Jones came away with an outstanding result in the platform event,” Salo said.
On Saturday, the Trojans came in sixth in the 800-yard freestyle relay (6:20.87). The Trojans won this event at the 2010 Pac-10 championships but this time used a different team with regulars Lefert, senior Zoltan Povazsay, sophomore co-captain Patrick White and freshmen Nick Karpov replacing senior co-captain James Martin. Texas won the race in 6:12.77.
Lefert and White both missed qualifying for the final of the 200-yard freestyle, taking ninth (1:34.11) and 15th (1:35.02) in the preliminaries, respectively. Lefert won the consolation final (1:33.84), finishing ninth overall with a time that would have placed him sixth in the A-final. White came in third in the same consolation final, finishing 11th overall with a time of 1:34.69.
Sophomore Dillon Connolly and junior Emmett Walling both swam in the consolation final of the 100-yard breaststroke, where Connolly took fifth (13th overall) in 53.35 while Walling came in eighth (16th overall) in 54.02.
Sunday’s competition saw Charlesworth become the sixth-fastest miler in USC history; he posted a season best of 14:54.51 and came ninth overall, touching just 0.80 seconds out of top eight.
Lefert scored in his third individual event of the competition in the 200-yard butterfly where he finished in 1:44.15.
“Clement Lefert was clearly our standout performer,” Salo said.
The Trojan 400-yard freestyle relay of Walling, White Povazsay and sophomore Jeff Daniels finished 12th with a time of 2:54.88.
USC finished with 116.5 points at the NCAA championships, which marked the team’s final collegiate competition of the season.
“We did well, but the coaches are already looking forward to next season,” Kipp said.

The Undergraduate Student Senate passed a resolution last Tuesday that recommended extending the Campus Cruiser hours of operation. The timing could not be more appropriate, considering the tragedy that took the life of USC Adrianna Bachan just one year ago.
Rita Yeung | Daily Trojan
The freshman from Montecito, Calif., was a victim of a hit-and-run accident that occurred in the early hours of March 29, 2009, as she was crossing Jefferson Boulevard with fellow student Marcus Garfinkle — who survived the accident — on her way home from The Row. As a friend and former sorority sister of Bachan, I cannot help but wonder how different things would be if she and Garfinkle had another way of getting home that night.
Campus Cruiser currently operates from 5 p.m. to 2:45 a.m., seven days a week, and the new resolution proposes the services be extended an hour longer. The Undergraduate Student Government began looking at this issue in the fall when a survey of presidents and vice presidents of student organizations revealed that 87 percent believed that Campus Cruiser services should run later into the night, especially Thursday through Saturday.
Some opponents argue that extending the hours will encourage students to stay out past this time. This point seems to be directed at students who are out partying, however, and doesn’t consider those who are simply at the library past 2 a.m. Further, this is a college campus; it would be naïve to ignore the fact that many students go out at night and consume alcohol, and those are generally the students who need a ride home.
The majority of debate, however, is centering around the treatment and safety of Campus Cruiser employees. The program, now under the management of USC Transportation, is one of the largest student-run, safe ride programs in the country. There are more than 115 employees, 24 Campus Cruiser vehicles, including three hybrids, eight Ford Windstar vans and one van for disabled passengers.
Clearly the Cruiser system is well-functioning and advanced — the problem is that students feel it is their only option, which places an influx of calls and huge burden on student drivers. Extending the hours until 3:45 a.m. is a good idea for students who need the ride, but what about the students giving it?
Is it reasonable to ask some students to drive until 4 a.m. in order to meet the demands of other students who are choosing to stay out that late?
The biggest problem is many students — myself included — are simply oblivious to the other forms of transportation that USC offers. The boundaries of Campus Cruiser are limited. Destinations that are commercial establishments and sporting/special events are prohibited, therefore many students will get dropped off as close to the location as the Cruiser will take them and walk the rest of the way.  This again brings up the question of safety; however, I wonder if this would be the first choice of students if there were other options readily available.
Well, there are.
Not only will Yellow Cab Co. take students anywhere within the city of Los Angeles, but the taxis also accept USCard, which is convenient for those who would prefer to use discretionary funds.
“I cannot believe I just found out that is an option two months before I graduate. I would give anything to have known that four years ago,” said Joe Houston, a senior majoring in sociology, when informed about the ability to use USCard to pay for Yellow Cab Co.
Another option students know little about is the tram system, including a shuttle that leaves The Lab and the 901 Bar & Grill every 30 minutes for L.A. Live on Fridays, Saturdays and Sundays. Plenty of students would use the service to get to L.A. Live and back had they known it was available.
And for students worried about safely getting home after late night study sessions, there are trams that leave from Leavey Library every 15 to 30 minutes, 24 hours a day.
Clearly then, there are other options for students beyond Campus Cruiser — I just don’t think students know or feel safe about using them.
Extending the hours of the Cruiser program isn’t a bad idea if the drivers are willing to do so, but it seems that many are opposed to the resolution. Perhaps USC should focus on advertising the versatility and safety of its tram system as well as the ability to use USCard for Yellow Cab Co. rather than further burdening the Campus Cruiser program with an entire campus’ transportation needs.
One of the biggest complaints of Angelenos is traffic, yet as a whole we are still resistant to utilizing public transportation. USC’s transportation system is a well-
functioning fleet, but students seem wary to hop onboard.
USG should focus on appeasing those fears by promoting every transportation resource so students can utilize what’s available for safe, efficient and reliable services to, from and around campus because no student should ever feel that walking home is their only choice.

As a former cruiser, I understand where cruiser comes from.
People call and lie and say they’ve been waiting for a tram, and really they haven’t because we have trackers for the tram.  Things like this put us way behind.
Just think… It’s Thursday night and there are 5 parties on the row.  Literally 50% of those people are freshman from New North and they want a ride…  WHAT would happen if all we did was continually go to the row and take them to campus…. that is ALL we would be doing, leaving the ppl who AREN’t Serviced in the tram waiting for 30 minutes.
What’s a way to fix this?!? Oh wait! There’s a large USC tram that literally picks up from three spots on the row and takes you to campus in ONE stop.  Yet, the Greek system seems to think they have the right to a cruiser “because I pay 52,000 for tuition”.  Yes Greek system, I’ve heard that about 30 times in my short stint there… no exaggeration.
And yes.  We are student workers. Please stop treating cruisers like they’re your servants.
On another note… usually if you are nice and ask politely, a tram driver will stop enroute infront of your house.
Maybe it’s just the way you’re asking.
Great story as USC Transportation does have many options available to the students for late night transportation.  We continue to strive at improving communication with the students.  We send emails, we update our website, we have a Facebook page, and we have ads on the Housing monitors in residence halls.  We are would love to hear other suggestions on how to reach the students…any thoughts?
Hi Hoping to Improve,
You asked, so I answered, haha. I think the email system is a really nice way to keep students updated about transportation options.  I also like the Facebook fan page idea, but I didn’t know it existed.  Here are some thoughts I’ve had about improving Trojan Transportation:
1). Perhaps another comprehensive email from Trojan Transportation outlining all student transportation options and how to access them (trams, cruiser, yellow cab, cruiser express, late-night Leavey Library Shuttle, etc.). This would probably be a long email, but useful.  It could also outline how to track trams by offering a link straight to the tram tracking website. And instructions about how to check the status of your cruiser call (online tracking, text/phone status checks). And it could direct them to the “survival guide” on the USC transportation website.  Transportation could also set up tables at student events on campus such as the student involvement fairs.
2).  There are a few ways I think the Trojan Transportation (http://transnet.usc.edu) website could be improved:
     -Sometimes things aren’t working the way they are scheduled.  Sometimes the tram routes are combined because only one tram is working; sometimes there’s no late-night leavey shuttle driver; there’s a traffic closure that affects tram routes or times, etc. If there were a scrolling bar/ticker or something right on the Transportation homepage that is constantly updated about the most current transportation status or news, it would be really helpful and easy for students to access to get the most up to date information.  Of course this would require someone who can constantly monitor and quickly update the status of Transportation options.
     -Another improvement to the transportation homepage could be direct hyperlinks to cruiser call tracking and tram tracking.  Currently these options are kind of buried in the website and require some searching to find.  If there were direct links to these right on the front of the homepage it might make it easier for students to find.
3.)  I know this is a significant cost and tram routes are changed periodically, so I don’t know how feasible this is right now, but scrolling LED boards at each stop that could tell students when the next tram is coming and also be linked to the current news ticker on the website if it were implemented.  I know there’s one at the Parking Center, and I think it would be helpful at the other stops.  Other cities and Universities have these kind of integrated systems in place for their transportation departments.
4.) A tram that services the western side of campus.  Perhaps only at night–past 10pm when trams C and D start.
5.)  Sometimes the trams are inconsistent, change their routes or don’t necessarily stop at every stop because they have no one on the tram currently going there.  But there could be people waiting at those stops. If this were not the case people would have more faith in taking the trams.  So, maybe someone needs to address this issue with the tram service/drivers.
1,2,& 3 deal specifically with improving communication with students. 4 and 5 are suggestions that could improve the system as a whole.  Finally, congrats on the success of the LA Live shuttle.  I’ve heard great things about it, and used it a couple times.  I think students really appreciate and love it.
Thanks Sara
Great article Sara.  You clearly pointed out the MAJOR problem with USC transportation: awareness of what is available to us.  Like Joe says in the article, if he had known about USC Taxi taking discresh sooner, he would have been using it more.  I bet a lot of other students feel the same way.  
I’m glad there is finally a writer for the Daily Trojan that actually gets all the facts together and presents them in a clear manner, instead of just blatantly throwing out inaccurate facts from unreliable and unqualified sources.
Cruisers, I think we’re missing the point here. 
I agree, of course, with what you’ve said. But this article, unlike the others that have come out in recent weeks, isn’t arguing for us to stay open at all. It takes into account our safety and misgivings about the whole debacle. It doesn’t criticize us, or even campus cruiser as a whole.
The author is someone we should agree with — she’s arguing that students should look to other forms of transportation, rather than rely solely on cruiser. 
So let’s celebrate! Now, at least, we have one reporter who’s listening to us.
Yeah, I totally agree.  I was going to post a disclaimer after my original post, because it sounds like I’m attacking the author, but I’m not trying to.  I think she’s spot on with some of it and she’s being honest.  I’m just adding some information to the discourse here and I take minor issue with some of her statements.  As I said, thank you Sara. It’s a well-aimed article and gets deeper into the reasons people are dissatisfied with Trojan Transportation than the original article did.  No student should feel like walking home is their only choice.  It’s not.
Thanks for following up last week’s article, Sara.  Many students do not know about all the options USC offers for their safe transportation around the USC community.  For instance, most students don’t know that you can track the trams online at USCtrams.com, or that you can check the status of your call by phone (just listen to the recording next time cruiser calls you when your car arrives), and even track your cruiser online through the Trojan Transportation website. (Go to http://www.transnet.usc.edu, click “USC transit” at the top of the page and then click “Campus Cruiser” on the sidebar).  Perhaps the students need to be made aware of these options, but the resources are there, and I suspect some students simply don’t bother to check (you could easily even just spend 5 minutes starting by Googling ‘USC transportation’, and find all your information that way).
As Cruiser put it, what bogs down the system and makes everything slower is when someone calls to request a ride that is already serviced by another form of Trojan Transportation.  When we get a “(grunt), (whine), (long exhale) silence, and then a “Where can I walk to so that I can get a cruiser” (merely asking this question tells us the motivation for your complaint is not a concern for safety but lack of convenience). Or a “Please give me a cruiser,” it keeps the phone lines busy, and shows that the student is unaware of the purpose of Campus Cruiser.  We are happy to explain why Cruiser won’t service you if there is a lack of understanding, but complaining makes everything slower for everyone.  The policy is clear-cut.
Some students either truthfully don’t know or just ignore the purpose of Campus Cruiser.  It is a safety service. Not a taxi. Too often calls are put into the system for groups of 6, 8 or (many) more students.  At these large group numbers, a reasonable person would consider it safe to travel by foot.  And all too often, students want to be taken to restaurants (La Barca, Panda, etc.) or other commercial locations.  Again, this is not what Campus Cruiser is for.  The reason the service does not operate to commercial locations is because these trips are not considered necessary or vital to the personal safety of the student. Unfortunately, people take advantage of the system, and that’s why it gets so busy.
As Sara stated, USC continues tram service 24 hours a day.  And on some nights Campus Cruiser operates from Leavey Library to all other residential locations within boundaries not on tram routes until 7am (The reason it’s not offered every day is that it’s hard to get students to work this shift, so imagine how difficult it would be to staff Cruiser after 3 am on a regular basis).  For students who are out late studying (It happens to all of us), these options are available.
And, as a student, I have a couple more concerns.
I don’t get another part of this issue.  Students seem to be holding USC and DPS responsible for their safety 24/7 even if they are off of university grounds and acting without reasonable regard for their own safety.  USC Transportation and DPS offer great protection to the students.  Most of us are adults, and should be able to make our own good decisions.  I’ll admit that I don’t always make the safest and most sound decisions, but I’m not going to blame USC for anything that happens to me because of that.  I feel like the University is being used as a scapegoat for unwise decisions that students make as adults.  If you want to do adult things like staying out past 3am for whatever reason, I don’t think it’s wrong to expect you to make responsible adult decisions.  
As your article applies to late night party people:  Sara, I don’t think the university is naive to the point that they believe underage students don’t drink.  That’s why they send DPS to monitor the parties and allow us to have a good time while keeping us safe.  They know that underage drinking occurs in some (probably all) of those parties, and they could book all the underage students for drinking and of-age students for supplying.  But they don’t.  DPS and the university are using the “boys will be boys” mindset, and they certainly don’t have the obligation to do that.  As students we should be grateful they offer even that discretion, and I don’t think it’s reasonable to ask the university to condone being out past the hour of 3am off of campus and not studying.
After all that, I’m not arguing that Trojan Transportation and the Campus Cruiser services are perfect.  I would also like to echo the call for some sort of tram service to extend west of campus.  These students live just as far away from campus as those who live north of campus and could be offered the same safe option.  There are better, and I suspect, cheaper ways to improve the great service Transportation offers without extending Campus Cruiser hours and student work hours.
Finally, it means a great deal to Cruisers and probably DPS officers if you give even just a little thank you for what they do.
Yo, Sara. Let me poke a few holes in your criticisms:
1. “This point seems to be directed at students who are out partying, however, and doesn’t consider those who are simply at the library past 2 a.m.”
Unbeknownst to you (and I’m not blaming you for missing it, but just pointing it out) a good 90% of those students who are at the library in the earlier hours of the morning aren’t our concern in this whole debate. Why? They take the trams! They are well-educated in our policies because many of them take cruiser a lot and do not fight us when they know they have to or can use the tram. The students who are at the library past 2:45am —- well, they take the tram, too. I find that the students who live in non-trammable areas (ie: west of campus) leave the library before cruiser closes. I commend these students for their responsibility and respect for cruisers. They know our hours, they know our policies and they rarely fight us.
2. “I cannot help but wonder how different things would be if she and Garfinkle had another way of getting home that night.”
This is a very sad, story, but they had plenty of ways to get home. She was a freshman and could have taken tram B back to the dorms from the row. They could have gotten her a taxi. Someone sober with a car could have given her a quick ride. If she did have another way of getting home, it probably would have happened to someone else because those monsters were still driving on the street that night. Don’t blame cruiser for your friend’s death. It could have well been another one of our peers; it unfortunately had to be her.
3. “this is a college campus; it would be naïve to ignore the fact that many students go out at night and consume alcohol, and those are generally the students who need a ride home.”
These are the students we are talking about when we get angry over this issue. Not the library kids, the people working on group projects looking to get home, the commuters wanting a ride to their parked vehicle west of campus. All the different kinds of cruiser users I just mentioned know about our policies and our hours — as well as the alternate transportation services. You know who fights us about taking the tram or our wait times or every rule we have? The partyers. The girls traveling in hordes who demand we take them to the 9-0 and report us to our supervisors if we don’t. The people unable to control their liquor who vomit all over our car, causing us to have to clean them. The belligerent frat guys who yell and scream and taunt our female drivers when we are having a busy night and our cars are running a bit behind. 
The packs of drunks wanting to get from one end of 29th St to the other. These are NOT the students we should concentrate on servicing and extending the hours would be condoning their rude, boorish and irresponsible behavior. If 90% of our rides were given to those cruiser users who don’t abuse the system — the studiers, the polite students, the ones who know where we can and can’t go and don’t yell when we suggest they take a tram instead — maybe more of us wouldn’t be so upset about this resolution. I feel a big part of Cruiser’s anger comes from the fact that we know we wouldn’t be taking nice people home, but that we’d be taking more brash and inconsiderate Row Heathens.
4. “I just don’t think students know or feel safe about using them.”
True story. Happens all the time. Girl A calls for a ride, she’s on a tram route. She’ll tell the phone person she “Doesn’t feel safe” taking the tram at 10pm vs taking a Cruiser at 10pm. WHY!? USC needs to educate it’s students — mainly the Greek population — on the alternate transportation services and show them they are just as safe. Why is getting in a car with a stranger student driver and maybe 1, 2 or even 5 other students you don’t know any safer than taking a USC SANCTIONED AND OPERATED BUS with a driver and 1, 2, 5 or even 10 students you don’t know? I’d even say the trams are safer; bigger groups = safety. USC Transportation is SAFE and (generally reliable.)
Instead of putting more money into keeping us open late, how about USC uses money on a nice ad campaign to educate students on the trams. New North kids would benefit from this, too.
And we need a West of Campus tram. USC ARE YOU LISTENING!?

After years of mainstream films, many good ideas have already been used.
With the lack of new plots going around Hollywood these days, it’s understandable, then, that successful films from the past are being rehashed. But how many remakes and sequels do we need?
Thanks to the recent success of Tim Burton’s Alice in Wonderland, not one, but two Wizard of Oz remakes are headed our way, one from Warner Brothers and one from New Line Cinema.
Clash of the Titans hits theaters April 2, and it looks to be a remake of Jason and the Argonauts and the Sinbad series.
And though a revival of the Greek adventure genre might be nice, the inundation of superhero remakes must end.
Instead of Spiderman 4, we’re getting a Spiderman series reboot, which will focus on Peter Park’s transformation into Spiderman (like Batman Begins did) during his high school years. And there’s also a Venom spin-off in the works. The X-men series has also done well, and has three potential films for the future.
Good thing there are other action movies to look forward to, like a new Jurassic Park (which might launch a whole new trilogy) and Terminators 5 and 6.
A little later this year, some sure-to-be-highly-promoted remakes and sequels we can expect are Ironman 2, Inception, Shrek Forever After, The Karate Kid, Toy Story 3, and Red Dawn.
Production companies want low-risk scripts that have a high chance of being profitable, but feels like the plethora of remakes in Hollywood are starting to feel old and if the public agrees, then choosing a series continuation rather than a fresh idea could be an unprofitable idea after all.

Pico. Figueroa. Spring.
We might walk, drive or bike the often-maddening grid of memorable Los Angeles streets, but knowledge of their namesakes remain elusive to even natives of the city.
Though L.A.’s history is one with many layers, our neighbors at the Natural History Museum of Los Angeles have created an ingenious six-part YouTube series that peels these layers away, going behind Downtown’s landmarks and exposing the people and events related to some of the area’s oldest names.
Not surprisingly, many of the early street names can be traced back to the days when Lala Land was El Pueblo de la Reina de Los Angeles and the first few videos in the series refer back to 1800s-era diseños, or maps, to show these origins.
Starting with Chinatown’s Ord Street — named for Edward C. Ord, who drew the first land survey of Los Angeles — the series discusses the reasoning behind Downtown’s street names such as Washington Boulevard, Pico Avenue and Alvarado Avenue.
As the city spread outward from the pueblo’s core, areas and streets bore the names of its Mexican history as well as Los Angeles’ first winemakers, landowners, developers, settlers and government officials.
But while some streets paid homage to people involved in their creation, others have been named for their physical landmarks (such as Downtown’s Aliso Street being named for its identifiable sycamore tree named El Aliso), national civil rights leaders (Martin Luther King Jr. Boulevard and Cesar E. Chavez Boulevard) or pay tribute to longtime local citizens (Georgia Street near the Staples Center).
Pairing old photographs and documents housed in the NHM’s own Seaver Center for Western History Research with current images of the streets being discussed, the videos are educational, but not boring. They acknowledge the city’s multicultural beginnings and put particular emphasis on the Mexican heritage that thrives today.
Easy to watch and guaranteed to teach you something new, the NHM’s “Street Names of Los Angeles — A History” series is one worth catching up with.
