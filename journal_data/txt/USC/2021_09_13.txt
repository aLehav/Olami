The USC football program will mutually part ways with now former head coach Clay Helton, USC Athletic Director Mike Bohn announced Monday afternoon. Former cornerbacks coach Donte Williams will serve as the interim head coach for the remainder of the season. The decision comes after a shocking blowout 42-28 loss to Stanford at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum in USC’s Pac-12 opener. 
“This afternoon I informed Clay of my decision to make a change in the leadership of our football program,” wrote Bohn in a statement released on Twitter Monday afternoon. “Clay is one of the finest human beings I have met in this industry, and he has been a tremendous role model and mentor to our young men. We appreciate his many years of service to our university and wish him nothing but the very best.”
Helton’s tenure at USC has been a tumultuous six-year period. After serving as an interim head coach in 2015, Helton’s first two complete seasons were instant successes — a 10-3 season with a marquee Rose Bowl victory over Penn State followed by an 11-3 year with a Cotton Bowl loss. The honeymoon period quickly ended, however, as his combined record over the next three seasons was 18-13. A blowout loss to Stanford at a packed Coliseum was the final straw for the administration of USC football. 
Bohn made it clear that USC will look to compete for the rest of the season under Williams.
“The season is just getting started,” Bohn wrote. “We have the opportunity to really do something special with this team and this program. I’m confident that [Williams] gives us a higher probability for success for the remainder of the season.”
In the coming months, USC will conduct a national search for a new head coach. 
“We will actively and patiently pursue a coach who will deliver on the championship aspirations and expectations we all share for our football program,” Bohn wrote.
Former USC quarterback Matt Leinart reacted to the decision on Twitter.
“Nothing but respect for Coach Helton but this team has been underachieving for a long time,” Leinart wrote. “They need a new energy and culture there, a championship culture. Change is good. It’s time to get that passion back into @USC_Athletics football. Fight On!”
Former Trojan long snapper Jake Olson reflected on Helton’s impact on his own USC football career. 
“I also want to thank Helton for fielding the first completely blind college football player,” Olson wrote on Twitter. “He didn’t listen to those who said I didn’t belong on the field but saw me as just another one of his players who had to prove my worth through my football ability not my physical ability.”
A previous version of this article referred to Williams as the former defensive backs coach. Williams is the former cornerbacks coach. The Daily Trojan regrets this error.

Women’s volleyball split their matchups on the road against Hawaii this weekend in the Stan Sheriff Center. 
Although the Trojans fell short to the Rainbow Warriors in four sets in the first matchup (25-17, 11-25, 25-21, 25-20), USC bounced back the following night with a four- set victory (21-25, 25-16, 25-22, 25-23), ending the weekend series tied.
After finishing off the Bluegrass Battle tournament and taking tough losses from No. 3 Kentucky and Creighton in the previous weekend, the Trojans regrouped and figured out a game plan for Hawaii.
 “Hawaii is a very different team than the Kentucky team,” said head coach Brad Keller in a phone interview with the Daily Trojan. “Kentucky was more physical [with] bigger players that are just jumping and hitting the ball. Hawaii just plays unbelievable defense. [They have] a gritty mentality, and nothing hits the floor … So, a lot of our efforts were based on understanding that, and that we weren’t going to land first-ball kills.” 
This season, the Trojans carry a veteran roster with only four freshmen Tyrah Ariail, Elle Glock, Katelyn Smith, Mia Tuaniga and the rest of the team made up of upperclassmen and graduate students. Although their roster shows plenty of experience on the court, Keller emphasized finding cohesiveness as a team.
“I think we are still in the process of learning about our team and about our team dynamics,” he said. “We’re a veteran group; we have a lot of older players on the team, but that doesn’t necessarily mean that we’ve been playing together or we understand one another. ” 
In the first game against Hawaii, USC played a solid game statistically. Graduate student outside hitter Brooke Botkin led all the attackers with a total of 17 kills, hitting .217 for the match. Junior outside hitter Kalen Owes followed with 10 kills and a hitting percentage of .214. Despite these offensive efforts, the team was unable to close out the first match. 
“I would say the reason why we lost the first match is, number one: Hawaii played very well. Number two: we weren’t prepared on defense before the ball was actually hit,” Keller said. “So we weren’t getting great touches on the defensive end …  and our transition swings weren’t [as good]. Those transition swings are big swing opportunities, but we were kind of just shooting the ball over back into play.”
However, the Trojans bounced back the following night. The team totaled a hitting percentage of .234. After a shaky start to the match in the first set, the Trojans shocked the Stan Sheriff Center as they took the final three sets, ending the match with 3-1. 
USC played an evenly balanced offensive and defensive game in the second meeting with Hawaii. Botkin and junior opposite hitter Emilia Weske both finished the match with 16 kills. Graduate student middle blocker Candice Denny totaled seven blocks and graduate student outside hitter Shannon Scully reached a season-high of 22 digs.
Now, the Trojans inch closer to conference play as they prepare to take on their final preseason matchup against the University of San Diego on Sept. 17 at Galen Center.

Men’s water polo netted 22 goals in a home win over Pepperdine Saturday, continuing from their success Sunday with blowout victories over Occidental and Claremont-Mudd-Scripps en route to an undefeated 5-0 start to the season.
The Trojans’ usual set of stars came to play in the 22-7 win over the Waves. Junior driver Marcus Longton led all scorers with five goals, while fellow junior driver Chris Sturtevant and senior 2-meter Jake Ehrhardt smashed in four a piece. The strong attack included 14 assists from 19 open play goals.
“It was a lot of our team coming together. We’ve just kind of finally started to get the whole entire team together because we had guys away for the Olympics,” Longton said. “It was a combination of people playing their roles and setting me up in a position to score goals.”
Against the Waves, the team also unleashed another critical aspect of their offense: senior goalie Nic Porter. Porter often initiated the attack from his own half, peppering the ball across the pool to set up drivers in deep positions. The 2021 All-America First Team goalie tallied an assist and numerous key passes that caught the Pepperdine defense out of position.
Speaking of defense, USC suffocated Pepperdine with constant on-ball pressure, limited the visitors to a .250 shot conversion rate and only allowed two goals in the second half.
“[We’re] t​​rying to be a defensive team first. [We] always put that as the number one priority in our game,” said head coach Marko Pintaric. “The guys took it [seriously]. We set up the goal for … the third quarter to not concede a goal. Same for fourth and we almost achieved [that].”
The Trojans continued their defensive showing on Sunday in the Inland Empire Classic, holding Occidental and Claremont-Mudd-Scripps to three and five goals, respectively. 
Pintaric played almost every player on the roster on Sunday’s doubleheader. 13 different Trojans scored in an easy 23-3 win over the Occidental Tigers.
Against the Stags, the Trojans rattled off five unanswered scores in the first period and never looked back. As USC defeated Claremont-Mudd-Scripps 16-5. Longton knotted an efficient three goals on four shots. and redshirt senior driver Jacob Mercep chipped in two. Mercep now sits seventh in the Trojans’ all-time scoring list with 165 goals. While pleased with their early success, the Trojans keep their eyes on the bigger picture, readying themselves for deep MPSF and NCAA tournament runs.
“We’ve got a lot of work to do in practice, and there’s definitely opponents out there who are preparing for us already. So we’re doing the same for them,” Ehrhardt said. “We really got to focus and dial in for the next three weeks before these big MPSF games. And then we’re going to go from there.”
Men’s water polo is back in action at the Aggie Roundup in Davis next weekend. USC will play San Jose State Friday at 1 p.m. then Santa Clara and UC Davis on Saturday at 11:30 a.m. and 4 p.m., respectively.

Following President Carol Folt’s large push for sustainability, including USC’s announcement of divestment from fossil fuels and the hiring of a chief sustainability officer, the University published its sustainability report last month, detailing the goals they set for completion by 2020. 
According to the report published last month, USC has met about 86% of the goals they set for the 2015-2020 time period, including decreasing greenhouse gas emissions per square foot by 35%, compared to their original goal of 20%. The University also achieved 41.4% of food purchasing from sustainable sources compared to their goal of 20%. Environmental studies assistant professor Victoria Petryshyn, who discusses solutions to environmental degradation in her classes, said the goals are sufficient, but could always be higher. 
“If you compared our sustainability practices to other peer institutions, it was kind of a joke, and then with some of the surveys that came out, we realized that sustainability is really very, very important to the student population here,” she said. “I would say the majority of students would like USC to do more.” 
While the report was published by the USC Office of Sustainability, the University, through the creation of USC Operations for sustainability activities for campus operations, created the plans included in the report in 2015, before the office existed. In 2018, key faculty members interested in helping the environment, including Dan Mazmanian, professor at the Sol Price School of Public Policy and chair of the Presidential Sustainability Working Group on Sustainable Education and Research, came together to create the plans in the Academic Senate Sustainability Committee to recommend sustainability goals extending until 2030. 
According to Mazmanian, the creation of the plans was a “huge challenge.” 
“USC was at zero in 2014 in thinking about these issues,” Mazmanian said. “It took the stepping out of operations to say, we can make a difference.”
Petryshyn said Folt is a key reason USC has “upped its sustainability game.”
“For a long time, USC basically paid lip service to sustainability,” Petryshyn said. “We had one sustainability employee, but it seemed like it was mostly for optics more than anything else.”
When Folt assumed her position at USC in 2019, she founded the Presidential Sustainability Working Group. According to the group’s website, Folt created the group as a step toward “reimagin[ing] sustainability as one of the four main pillars of USC’s priorities.”
“We didn’t have a chief sustainability officer,” Mazmanian said. “We didn’t have the kind of leadership that President Folt is now exhibiting in this area, so it was a first step for USC into a very, very important world.”
The coronavirus pandemic also interfered with the University’s progress in 2020. Petryshyn said that it was challenging to continue prioritizing sustainability when the pandemic was a “bigger, more immediate problem,” and the University’s focus shifted to addressing that rather than improving sustainability practices.
“Things that end up being very important for sustainability like reducing single use plastics, [are] directly at odds with best health practices,” she said. “But at the same time, … [Los Angeles] in general missed a few opportunities during COVID, when people were staying at home to maybe install more bike lanes, make things more pedestrian-friendly, plant more trees, things like that.” 
Chief Sustainability Officer Mick Dalrymple said the coronavirus pandemic also changed the general public’s mindset about pressing world issues. 
“[The pandemic] has caused us to be very agile, so you need to make a plan, but you’ve got to realize that that plan could morph slightly or can morph tremendously in a day or in a week,” Dalrymple said. “[The coronavirus] has taught us how to be able to do that, to make a plan, but also, be able to respond to rapidly changing circumstances.” 
In some ways, the coronavirus prompted some of the green changes implemented around campus, Ellen Dux, Office of Sustainability Associate Director, said.
“We hauled out around 1,700 fixtures… and replaced them with touchless fixtures,”  Dux said. “That was very much driven by COVID, and [it was] the reason we were able to prioritize it again through the budgeting cycle. They also happened to be vastly more water efficient.”
Dux said students “pushed [their concerns] to a level” that sparked some of the sustainability initiatives the office is undertaking, including the office’s current plans to place compost bins at various locations around campus. There are currently about 24 bins in the USC Village, but Dux said that this venture was inspired by students. 
“We know that students are the reason we’re all here,” she said. “[Students] are core to the mission of what the University is educating. Turning out incredible global citizens is the work of the University.”
In 2020, the Office of Sustainability sent out a survey to students, faculty, staff and alumni, encouraging them to provide feedback as to what goals the office should set for 2028. 
In the survey, 52% of respondents indicated they did not know how to get involved with sustainability efforts on campus. Petryshyn said the Environmental Student Assembly and local chapters of the Sunrise Movement, a youth-run political organization that focuses on stopping climate change, are important organizations that students can join to get involved in sustainability locally. However, she said it is not entirely students’ jobs to seek this out for themselves. 
“That’s part of USC’s job, too, is to make those things more visible,” she said. 
Dux said that the team is focused on increasing acknowledgment of on-campus sustainability efforts. 
“We’ve spent the summer figuring out where students are congregating on social media,” Dux said, “The more we have students helping us to get the word out about these kinds of things, in my opinion, is one of the most critical ways that students can kind of get involved in this sort of work.”
Looking forward, the Office of Sustainability plans to release goals for 2028 by next January. 
“[The goals] will be ambitious and we will build in transparency… so that everybody knows where we’re at in the process,” Dalrymple said. “We all know the climate crisis and what needs to be done there and so we’re just going to push for as much as we can do as fast as we can go and get everybody to rally around it and make it happen.”
Correction: A previous version of this article misstated that a group of faculty members created USC’s sustainability plans in 2015, rather than the USC Operations for sustainability activities for campus operations. The article also didn’t include the name of the group of faculty members, who are members of the Academic Senate Sustainability Committee, who came together in 2018 to recommend sustainability goals extending until 2030. The Daily Trojan regrets this error.

Growing up in Gentilly, New Orleans, Makayla Howard is used to staying home with her family during hurricanes, waiting out the storm with her four siblings, three cats and two dogs and stepping outside occasionally to watch the storm pass through her neighborhood. 
Howard’s dad is also a police officer, so, while other families evacuate, her family usually stays home with her pets as her dad patrols the streets. 
But when weather services predicted a category four hurricane — Hurricane Ida —  on the 16th anniversary of Hurricane Katrina, this time everyone in Howard’s family aside from her father evacuated, driving 12 hours to Atlanta to stay with her grandparents. 
Instead of taking a nearly four-hour flight back to New Orleans, Howard, a resident assistant and junior majoring in fine arts, scrolled through Twitter and called her mom from Los Angeles, asking for updates as Ida moved toward her hometown. Her dad, patrolling the streets of New Orleans and serving on the “frontlines,” sent her photos of families he was helping evacuate and reunite, Howard said. 
Colleen Daly, a junior majoring in theatre from near Metairie, New Orleans, said her family evacuated to Alabama then Florida, staying away from home for about two weeks. Throughout their evacuation, Daly’s parents kept her updated on their evacuation and tried to provide updates on the status of her house.
Although Daly’s family did not find flood damage after they returned home Friday — since they safeguarded their home after it flooded during Katrina —  their roof and windows were damaged from the wind and fallen trees. 
While many students faced challenges adjusting to the beginning of the semester — balancing school, work and other responsibilities — Howard and Daly dealt with the added stress of worrying about the safety of their families back home.
“It’s been really stressful for everyone,” Howard said. “Since I’m here, it’s been very weird to watch it [happen] but not being able to be there to support in the way that I’m used to doing.”
Scott Weinstein, a freshman majoring in theater whose family lives in a New York City suburb, also said he wished he could have been home to help out his family. While Weinstein’s house was not damaged, his grandmother’s house was flooded, ruining her basement floors, carpets and stove. 
Since New York declared a state of emergency and many streets were flooded, Weinstein’s grandmother could not leave her home and found difficulty obtaining help as her basement flooded.
“I wish I could have been there to help her out, like to drive over there … help her pack stuff up and be there for her because my grandpa isn’t able to help her out,” Weinstein said.
As Ida moved up the east coast, Joyce Jiang, a freshman majoring in health and human sciences from Danville, N.J., just started her first weeks of classes, spending a lot of time in the library and paying little attention to the weather back home.
But, after realizing Ida’s severity, Jiang checked in on her parents. In previous hurricanes, Jiang’s house has flooded, with water levels nearly reaching the second floor. This time, her house avoided serious damage, but her neighbors by the riverfront and cousins in Queens, N.Y. dealt with flooding.
“There was water coming out of every single sewer, like the toilets, the bathtubs, the sinks, and they just had to move like the couches onto the counters and everything like that and it took a while for the water to drain,” Jiang said.
Left without power in their home for about two weeks, Howard’s family stayed in Atlanta for the entirety of that period while her dad worked in New Orleans. Aside from the loss of power, there was no damage to her home.
While her street often floods after “long rains,” her house, which was rebuilt after Katrina, has not flooded in 10 years of her living there, Howard said. 
Her cousins, however, came home from evacuating their home to see that a tree had fallen on her roof, caving in the ceiling of a bedroom. Howard’s friends also dealt with damage to their homes and await Federal Emergency Management Agency assistance. 
Howard’s younger siblings, one who is in high school and the other two who are in middle school, had just returned to in-person classes when Ida hit. Now,  they don’t know when they will return to the classroom again. 
On Sept. 2, USC Campus Support & Intervention emailed students who may have been affected by Hurricane Ida and suggested students reach out to USC Counseling and Mental Health. In a statement to the Daily Trojan, Campus Support and Intervention said it offers services such as counseling, time off from courses and other troubleshooting to students who might have been affected by natural disasters.
While Howard said the resources offered in the email did not seem particularly helpful, she said her mom plans to contact USC about Howard receiving an extension for her financial aid because of the hurricane.
After dealing with the beginning of classes and worrying about her family, Howard said  she is relieved her family is OK and that her home did not receive more damage.
“I also have a lot of things on my plate right now, but that added part of it was very stressful when it was happening,” Howard said. “So, I’m very glad it all worked out because I don’t even know what would happen if anything serious had gone down to our house, so we’re just very lucky that our house is OK.”

Netflix’s latest release “Kate” skips, darts and tumbles, but never really takes the time to stand up. The action-packed thriller stars Mary Elizabeth Winstead as the titular “Kate,” a female assassin who is mysteriously poisoned one night and only has 24 hours to find the culprit before she dies. Kate must fight and kill members of the Yakuza through Tokyo to do so. Along the way, she develops a platonic friendship with Ani (Miku Martineau), the daughter of one of Kate’s past targets. 
“Kate” lacks a cohesive storyline, and even when the action is fast-paced and dramatic enough to distract the audience, it’s still difficult to shake the feeling that the directors don’t really know what it’s doing or where it’s going. The gist of the movie is that Kate goes around killing and threatening individuals in a Japanese city painted as “foreign” and “other.” Japanese pop songs playing in the background not only  accompany the action but also emphasize the film’s over-reliance on establishing atmosphere rather than an actual storyline. 
The use of Japanese aesthetics and imagery, from geishas to neon Japanese signs, allude to Kate’s disorientation in her surroundings. Yet, they don’t do much except offer a superficial understanding of Japan for the purpose of advancing a white woman’s narrative. On a more serious level, harmful racial tropes present themselves in both the storyline and the visuals. The majority of Asians in the film are portrayed as either villains or without agency of their own. Many of the individuals that Kate encounters are subject to the whims of a dangerous and powerful white “heroine” who, if she wanted, could essentially end them all. 
The theme of foreignness is a key element of the film, with Japan’s exoticism to Kate depicted through the setting and visual elements. This idea is one that needs to be challenged, and it is somewhat mentioned when Ani calls Kate a “foreigner,” which subverts the framework of Japan as foreign and instead labels Kate as an outsider to the environment instead. Ani, too, is alluded to as a “foreigner” when she is stigmatized for being biracial. It’s an interesting and nuanced dynamic that is only given a superficial kind of relevance, much like the rest of the film. 
Narratively, the halfhearted attempt to add real, gripping stakes — the time limit, for instance — feels superficial, an element haphazardly thrown in as if to create some suspense in a film that lacks it. The dialogue reduces itself to a cheesy imitation of an action movie rather than an actual effort to advance the storyline. 
That isn’t to say Winstead doesn’t do a compelling job of salvaging the character. Winstead is fierce when she needs to be and, at necessary times, vulnerable in her developing relationship with Ani. When Ani’s onscreen, it’s questionable why Ani is the sidekick rather than the protagonist.
Ani is intelligent, and knows her way around the city, which is much more than Kate can say. The film is titled “Kate,” but it should be named after Ani instead, who is the character with the most evident, vivid and memorable personality.
Ani’s relationship with Kate is also the more intricate aspect of a film that, for the most part, is a misfire. As a much more likable character than Kate, Ani faces real tension as she’s continuously misunderstood and mistreated by those who are supposed to be her “family.” Ani’s conflict as the “outsider” is much more authentic than the contrived nature of Kate’s, and viewers are given much more insight into Ani’s identity and her aspiration to be as strong and edgy as Kate. 
These rare glimpses at the film’s deeper dimensions — the female friendship and the overarching theme of being an outsider — are fleeting. With the convoluted plot twists at the end of the film, “Kate” drags on far too long and is an overall disappointing experience to watch. There’s some heartwarming merit to some parts, but the film’s lack of imagination pushes it down even as Kate attempts to pull herself up. 
“Kate” doesn’t have much depth to it, choosing instead to focus on the attention-grabbing action scenes. It fumbles through the moments that demand the actual attention, which means that, when Kate the character ultimately falls,  the film also falls for good.

One of my favorite Pixar films of all time is “Cars.” Sure, it’s an animated kids movie, but it’s a lot more than just talking cars and racing. Instead, it’s a larger metaphor for life that questions not only what drives us but also whether or not it’s what sustains us. 
In “Cars,” the audience is told from the beginning that flashy race car Lightning McQueen (Owen Wilson) has one goal, to get to Los Angeles and compete for the pinnacle of racing achievement: the Piston Cup. However, it’s worth noting that the majority of the film isn’t even set in L.A. but instead in the small Arizona town of Radiator Springs along Route 66. McQueen is forced to stay there and fix the road after accidentally wrecking it, much to his chagrin. He just wants to get going on his path to L.A. and despises getting stuck at what he views as a dead end.
McQueen doesn’t quite vibe with the Radiator Springs philosophy, where enjoying the people (or cars) and nature around you is more important than winning any award. Consequently, most of the cars in Radiator Springs initially view McQueen as a selfish, immature and vain race car. Yet, McQueen’s desire for productivity isn’t a novel sentiment. In fact, it could be said that, in some ways, going to L.A. is a projection of his dream and, by association, big-city living. 
During McQueen’s stay, a Porsche named Sally Carrera (Bonnie Hunt) introduces McQueen to Route 66, where she says the road moves with the land. It wasn’t until later, she tells him, that an interstate was constructed that cut through the land and effectively removed Radiator Springs from the map — all just to “save time” so that cars could reach their destinations faster. McQueen is shocked at this revelation. 
Carrera also reveals to McQueen that she was once a hotshot lawyer in L.A. until she suffered from burnout, finding that there was no meaning in her life. It was only when she got to Radiator Springs that she truly became happy. By the time McQueen gets to L.A. for the competition, he’s changed and can’t stop thinking about the small town he’s come to appreciate. 
This past summer, my family and I visited Williams, Ariz. along Route 66 and the surrounding areas for a “glamping” experience. We lived in a small dome with no Wi-Fi and internet connection. It was a frustrating experience for me, mostly because I was trying to submit an assignment for an internship and wasn’t able to. During my time there, I kept trying to find an internet connection so I could submit and work on all my assignments.
Sometimes desert bugs and dust would creep in, and I’d get frustrated because I just wanted to be in what I envisioned was a shiny L.A. apartment and complete all my assignments so I could advance my post-college career. 
I’d spent so much time trying to get into USC and was still somewhat unsatisfied at how there is so much I hadn’t achieved yet. I wrote out what opportunities I wanted to pursue in L.A. and envisioned myself as a “successful” person, whatever that meant. Like McQueen, I did resent what I perceived as an unnecessary stay. I didn’t step out of the dome much, but a frustration with the lack of internet led me out one evening. 
As cliché as it sounds, the nature around me was the kind you keep thinking about. It was the first time I’d been out in so much dirt, dust and grass. I loved it. There was this beautiful hazy evening sky, the moon was just coming out and you could hear the rustle of animals all around you. It’s a scene that I miss a lot now as I write this in my apartment with the revving of motorcycles, angry honking and the screeching of cars that, like McQueen, are rushing to get somewhere faster without interruptions or who just want to win a race they’ve created for themselves that no one else is participating in.
I think what “Cars” tells us is that it’s OK to stop and pull over sometimes to look at reality more than our illusions. Something I’ve felt as a USC student, and a transfer especially, is the fear of being left behind. If “life is a highway,” as Tom Cochrane’s song goes in the movie, then I often feel like I’m one of the slowest cars. I’m asking if I’m right for the highway, but I’m never asking if the highway is right for me. 
The idea of stopping and smelling the roses isn’t a new one, but “Cars” renders it beautifully. Maybe as USC students, we can relate to the feeling of viewing college or USC as a stepping stone for our future dreams. Maybe like McQueen, we’re in love with this idea of L.A. and what it might represent for us: perhaps not winning the Piston Cup but winning something else in life. It’s OK to pursue these dreams, but it’s also OK to detour a bit and to take the more scenic route. Instead of accelerating all the time, it might even be OK to take a “brake” (get it?) every once in a while.
I spent so much time at home wanting to come to L.A., but now that I’m here, I find myself reflecting on home a lot. I can’t help thinking that, unlike what Cochrane says, life isn’t about the highway at all. It’s about the moment that you turn off the engine and realize: Here, in this space, is where you park.

Usually known for delicious BBQ, vast ranches and its nickname as the Lone Star State, Texas can now claim notoriety as the state with one of the most restrictive abortion bans in the country. 
Last week, Texas Gov. Greg Abbott signed into law a ban on most abortions past the sixth week of pregnancy. Specifically, the law bans abortions once cardiac activity occurs in the embryo. Keep in mind, this “cardiac activity” does not come from a true heartbeat but rather electrical activity since heart valves wouldn’t have formed yet in an embryo. 
As a result of this new law, most people have two weeks after a missed period to confirm a pregnancy, decide to get an abortion and schedule it. Considering myself and countless others I know who often have irregular periods, someone is unlikely to realize in time they’ve missed a period. Abortion providers in Texas approximate that 85% of patients seeking abortion are at least six weeks pregnant, leaving many organizations forced to deny care under the new law. In a 5-4 vote, the Supreme Court refused to block the law.  
I’m not here to argue about the issue of abortion itself, because the subject isn’t debatable. If abortion is against a person’s religious beliefs, they can choose not to get an abortion; however, they cannot force those beliefs onto other people. People should have the right to reproductive choice. End of discussion. 
Instead, I want to focus on the Texas abortion law’s impact on Planned Parenthood. Specifically, I want to highlight the work the nonprofit does for immigrants and people of color. 
After the Texas law passed, I worked through feelings of complete rage and despair, surprised that I was still surprised. Unfortunately, this isn’t the first, and certainly won’t be the last time people in power — specifically white men — endangered reproductive rights. 
In 2019, President Trump announced his intention to defund organizations that provide abortion services, such as Planned Parenthood, and direct the money to religious based, anti-abortion groups.  However, Planned Parenthood won’t go down without a fight, despite facing a conservatively-stacked court and an ambiguous law.  
Nationwide, Planned Parenthood operates 820 health centers with sexual and reproductive care, education and information that benefits over five million people each year.  Although conservatives associate the organization exclusively with abortion services, Planned Parenthood offers essential resources for overall health such as birth control, breast, cervical and testicular cancer screenings, prenatal care, treatment for sexually transmitted infections and sex education, among others. Any push to defund Planned Parenthood restricts life-saving medical interventions in addition to abortion. 
These past few years, Planned Parenthood maintained a strong partnership with the Women’s March, despite the organization facing criticisms of anti-semitism and inadequate diversity. The absence of police riot gear and the accompanying label of the march as “peaceful” undoubtedly had less to do with the actions of the marchers and more to do with the privilege they receive from their skin color. 
Understandably, this equates the clientele of Planned Parenthood to majority middle-to-upper class white women who adorn pink pussy hats, wear “I Stand With Planned Parenthood” pins and may lack knowledge of intersectionality. I want to debunk this misconception. Planned Parenthood provides essential services to millions of people who would otherwise not have health insurance — many of whom are immigrants and people of color. 
Half of the 2.4 million people who depend on Planned Parenthood for healthcare use Medicaid. Additionally, about 54% of Planned Parenthood’s health centers are located in rural and medically underserved communities. 
In a 2016 survey, 26% of clients at a Planned Parenthood site claimed it was the only place they could receive service. About 500,000 of Planned Parenthood patients are Latinx — making up nearly a quarter of patients — and 360,000 of annual patients are Black. Planned Parenthood’s contraceptive services prevent about 579,000 unintended pregnancies each year. 
Compared to other providers such as health departments and federally qualified health centers, Planned Parenthood offers more same-day appointments and extended hours, which are especially important in Texas now because of the small window to obtain an abortion. Additionally, centers offer on-site prescriptions, allowing women to avoid a trip to a separate pharmacy. This is critical for patients who cannot afford to take time off work.
Anti-abortion groups specifically target groups across race and class lines. In Texas, middle and high-income people can take time off work and travel out of state for abortions, leaving low-income people disproportiontely impacted by the new law. 
After the law passed, Planned Parenthood clinics in Texas entered panic mode. Centers overflowed, and 70% of the women who called in seeking abortion care this past week were turned away. Planned Parenthood will fight these laws and operate as best they can under their new restrictions. For example, Planned Parenthood affiliates won a court battle that protects their employees from lawsuits under the new law. 
Lawmakers specifically targeting abortion are only putting the first hammer to the wall; with enough hits, the protections for overall reproductive health will come tumbling down in a cloud of dust. As only one of the first lines of defense in ensuring the right to overall health and reproductive choices, Planned Parenthood cannot stand alone. Knowing the organization’s importance and the foundations of bodily autonomy at stake, we must support them and our right to choose.

“Skate and destroy” is a phrase from the popular skateboarding magazine “Thrasher.” It represents the spirit of skateboarding and perseverance against self-imposed obstacles that skateboarders find in the most unthinkable places. 
However, “skate and destroy” seems to have been taken seriously by those on the periphery of skate culture. Anti-skate devices and architecture are very real and often go unnoticed by those outside of the skating community. They can be as simple as tiled or brick sidewalks, or as obvious as metal pegs — which skaters colloquially call “skate stoppers” — on the edges of benches and ledges. 
USC has incorporated some of these elements into their own architecture and has long policed the sport. For example, across the street from the Hoover and Jefferson entrance to USC is a famous skate spot called the “Block.” 
In order to discourage skaters from doing tricks on the ledges, USC introduced sections of loose gravel and dirt directly around them. The spot still remains popular and many professional skaters, such as Ishod Wair, have recently skated the ledges. However, when these lengths are taken to stop skaters, the message is clear: Skaters from the surrounding community are not welcome. 
When you take into account the small amount of recreational areas and green spaces in the surrounding community, that leaves virtually nowhere to skateboard. However, things could change. Now that skateboarding is in the Olympics, the University has an opportunity to further legitimize the sport in mainstream culture and reconcile its relationship with the skaters in the surrounding community of South Central. 
Brian Wood, who started skating in 1977 at the age of seven, frequents the Exposition Park Rose Garden, a popular skate spot that hugs the outer edge of USC. For Wood, skateboarding changed his life and allowed him to meet thousands of people from all corners of the world. In Wood’s opinion, it’s not even a question: USC needs to make a skatepark. 
“The University is considered the brain of the society so everything that goes on through the society goes on through the University,” Wood said. “If you can have a field, you could also have a skatepark.” 
That skatepark could provide a safe space for everyone in the community to skate. There are only three skateparks around the USC area and the closest one, Gilbert Lindsay Skatepark, is about two miles away from the school. A skatepark at USC would not only be convenient but also a center for the community. It would transform the University from a bloated imposition to a part of the surrounding landscape. 
“USC is in a really unique position because of its location within the community,” Wood said. “You see how many people are here regularly skateboarding just across the street on the other side of the blocks, so they’re obviously coming from the surrounding communities so they could definitely do a lot to transition that through the skateboarding.” 
Camo Jorel has been skating for about 20 years and also frequents the skate spot at Expo Park. For Jorel, a skatepark at USC would create a place for skaters to hang out and have fun. Furthermore, a skate team at USC would represent something else entirely. 
“What it would do for the people is you can literally see somebody who was born here, get out of here, make it, become something, which would inspire other people from the neighborhood,” Jorel said. “We come from a neighborhood where nobody makes it out. What makes you think you’re gonna make it out? So, the more things you have to get good at like skateboarding, that will be just another way for people to make it out of this situation.”
A skateboarding team would be a new opportunity for kids in the South Central community. They would be able to use their talent on the board as a way to gain access to the financially inaccessible USC. It would also be an opportunity for kids to realize their dreams to become a professional skater. If USC has a football team, a basketball team and a rowing team, then it can make room for a skateboarding team. 
Establishing this sort of competition on a university-level would not be difficult for USC, an institution that not only has resources that can be reallocated to create skateboarding facilities but also a large surrounding community where skateboarding is integral to its culture. 
Ultimately, we need to stop suppressing skate culture. Let the youth skate and destroy. Let the youth have a space to have fun without being policed and harassed. While USC students are allowed to skate to class, South Central skaters are not given the same privilege. USC’s stance on skateboarding should be the same across the board: Either everyone is allowed to skate or no one is. The correct thing to do is the former. 
Brian’s son, Taj, is a nine-year-old skater who has been skating since he was a one-year-old. If USC was to have a team, Taj said he hopes to skate in the street competition. 
For a kid like Taj, a skatepark would be a place where he could explore the sport and culture of skateboarding safely and comfortably. 
“It shouldn’t just be to college students, it should be to everyone,” Taj said. “it should be open to everyone.”
