Four USC professors are working on a project that could potentially help build structures on the moon.
Berok Khoshnevis, professor of industrial and systems engineering and the project’s principal investigator, will present the proposal today at a conference in Washington, D.C.

NASA chose to fund this project, along with 29 others, in August from a pool of nearly 800 proposals. Each proposal receives approximately $100,000 for one to develop feasible structures, according to a NASA press release.
Khoshnevis; Anders Carlson, an assistant professor of architecture and director of the Master of Building Science Program; Neil Leach, a visiting professor in the school of architecture; and Madhu Thangavelu, a professor of astronautics in the Viterbi School of Engineering and lecturer in the school of architecture, will lead the project.
The project takes Khoshnevis’ Contour Crafting device, a 3-D printer that uses cement to build structures layer by layer, and converts the structure for use on the moon.
Khoshnevis began work on his Contour Crafting device in 2000, and it was named one of the top 25 inventions by the National Inventors Hall of Fame in 2006.
The team is currently working on a prototype of the Contour Crafting Simulation Plan for Lunar Settlement Infrastructure Build-Up. Right now, the team is developing a nozzle system that would heat lunar soil into a consistent paste that could be used like cement in the terrestrial Contour Crafting device.
“NASA’s Kennedy Space Center is an expert in processing lunar material. They make the lunar simulant material we use for testing. It has the same composition of the soil on the moon,” Khoshnevis said. “We have gotten some of this material, so we are melting this material at USC and trying it out at contour crafting and building smaller structures.”
Khoshnevis said the next step is “actually building something useful.” The team will go to NASA’s testing facility in Arizona, Desert Research and Technology Studies, or D-RATS, after it develops the machinery.
“We’ll take it to Arizona and use the soil there and, using the sun power and the build structure, do what is supposed to happen on the moon and give the first try on earth at the D-RATS site,” Khoshnevis said.
Khoshnevis said scientists are very familiar with the conditions of different soils on the moon as a result of NASA’s previous research, and the sand in Arizona is similar to the kind found on the moon.
The Lunar Contour Crafting device would be used to build basic infrastructure, such as landing pads, aprons to guard against debris from landings, hangars and shields to create shade. The self-assembling device would use solar energy.
“The electrical energy that we create can drive different machinery as well as a heater that melts the lunar heater,” Khoshnevis said. “Then it extrudes the molten material, which is like lava, out of a nozzle that is contour-crafting. On a layer-by-layer basis it builds these different structures.”
The device will use sulfur-based material, but because the melting point of sulfur is close to the higher temperatures reached on the moon, shields made of ceramic materials, which have a lower melting point, will be used to create shade.
Once such an infrastructure is in place, Khoshnevis said, habitable structures could be a travel destination for space tourists. Communication devices could be put on the moon, a more stable environment than in orbit where they are hit with space debris, and a telescope on the moon would give researchers a clearer view of the universe because the moon has no atmosphere.
Building structures on the moon would also provide a way for testing the possibilities of going to other planets.
“Whatever you want to try on Mars or other planets would be easier to test on the moon first,” Khoshnevis said. “It only takes three days to get there.”
Though Khoshnevis said building permanent structures on the moon might not happen in his lifetime, it could happen during the lifetimes of current students.
“The human is a brand new species,” Khoshnevis said. “While some people think everything that could be invented [has] already been invented, I believe that we are just at the beginning and that we haven’t scratched the surface of what we can do. It’s a good feeling to be on the front lines of those discoveries.”

The USC Shoah Foundation Institute for Visual History and Education has begun expanding its collection of testimonials by preserving and sharing video testimony from survivors of the 1994 Rwandan genocide.
The institute plans to expand its Visual History Archive by 2012 to include 50 testimonies from Rwandan survivors and witnesses, the Shoah Foundation announced Friday.
Donald Miller, executive director of the USC Center for Religion and Civic Culture and professor of religion and sociology, said USC can play an integral role in the preservation of history from the Rwanda genocide.
“I am very pleased that the Shoah Foundation is sharing its expertise with survivors of the genocide in Rwanda,” he said. “Western nations ignored this atrocity in 1994, refusing to see it as a genocide, even though more than 800,000 Tutsis were killed in 100 days. It is important to document this genocide because history tends to repeat itself.”
Testimonies from the genocide have been collected in Rwanda by the Kigali Genocide Memorial Center. Through this partnership, the Kigali Genocide Memorial Center will maintain ownership of the files, while the Shoah Foundation Institute helps to build expertise in visual cataloging and dissemination of the testimonies.
The expansion of the Visual History Archive was made possible by collaborations with IBUKA, a non-profit organization that represents survivors of the 1994 Rwandan genocide.
The Shoah Foundation Institute has conducted 10 pilot interviews with Rwandan survivors living in the United States and has indexed them according to the institute’s methodology.
Current visiting fellows at the Shoah Foundation Institute, who are Rwandan genocide survivors themselves, are working with the staff to develop an indexing terminology for the new testimonies that will be added to the Visual History Archive.
“The lesson we’ve gotten from the pilot program is that survivors want to come forward, and they come with the mindfulness that they are speaking on behalf of those who did not survive. They are leaving a legacy so people know what happened,” Karen Jungblut, director of research and documentation at the Shoah Foundation Institute, said in a press release. “For people who were meant to be eradicated, these testimonies are an important reassurance that their lives and their stories are important to the world.”
Steven Spielberg established the Survivors of the Shoah Visual History Foundation, which was the precursor to the institute, in 1994 after producing Schindler’s List. The Foundation was created to gather video testimonies from survivors and witnesses of the Holocaust.
The Visual History Archive has grown to hold 52,000 video testimonies in 32 languages, representing 56 countries since the institution’s founding.
The Shoah Foundation is helping give genocide victims a voice, Stephen Smith, executive director of the Shoah Foundation, said in a press release.
“We cannot compare human suffering, but its causes and consequences must be compared, with the historical integrity of each experience clearly delineated in a manner that is deep and respectful,” Smith said.
Richard Dekmejian, a professor of political science who is involved in researching with the Shoah Foundation Institute, said the current archive is one-of-a-kind.
“The work of the Shoah Foundation Institute is unique and unprecedented as a world center of genocide documentation for survivor testimonies,” he said. “This massive effort [began] with Holocaust testimonies, and now [will] include the Rwandan Genocide, the Armenian Genocide, as well as other genocides to be covered in the future.”
Dekmejian said students can directly benefit from the Shoah Foundation’s collection of testimonies.
“Dozens of my students have used Holocaust testimonies with great success and I am delighted to be associated with the Shoah leadership and faculty to further my own research on comparative genocides,” Dekmejian said.

The Village will aim to provide more affordable housing options to students, university officials said Wednesday.
Housing · As part of the plans for The Village at USC, Cardinal Gardens, Century Apartments and La Sarbonne Apartments will be torn down and replaced in part with about 5,400 beds for USC students. - Photo courtesy of The Village at USC
Kristina Raspe, vice president of real estate and asset management, said at the Master Plan Forum hosted by the Undergraduate Student Government that The Village would feature many additional university-owned student housing units to avoid the displacement of residents in the neighborhoods surrounding USC.
Alternative housing choices will also prevent students from paying high rent to third-party renters in the area, according to Raspe.
“We’ve had a lot of comments from our neighbors that our students have overrun the neighborhood and unfortunately caused the displacement of a lot of long-term residents,” Raspe said. “So, the goal of this project is to reverse that pattern and to start bringing students back to university-owned land.”
Though The Village will replace Cardinal Gardens, Century Apartments and La Sarbonne Apartments, which together have a total of 3,211 beds, plans estimate adding about 5,400 beds.
“This student housing would be affordable and appropriate for students,” Raspe said. “A lot of our students are living in substandard housing that they’ve leased from third-party owners that don’t necessarily have [students’] best interest in mind.”
Samantha Ma, a senior majoring in biomedical engineering, said she would only consider living at The Village because of its proximity to campus.
“The only reason why I might want to live [there] is because of the convenience and how close I would be to everything,” Ma said.
Isabella Urrea, a sophomore majoring in philosophy, politics and law, said off-campus housing tends to be cheaper.
“USC housing is overpriced and charges way to much money for everything,” Urrea said. “Being guaranteed four years of housing wouldn’t affect me because I chose to leave USC housing because rent [for off campus housing] is cheap and there are good locations.”
Raspe also said one of the many goals of the master plan is to build and sustain the new University Village in an environmentally friendly way by achieving LEED’s gold standard.
“We’re really doing a lot of work on the site to help in order to achieve a gold standard neighborhood development,” Raspe said. “We’re looking at geothermal [and] photovoltaic [energy], as well as collecting rainwater and creating natural plant systems.”
Some students, however, said they were disappointed the project would not immediately impact them.
“Even though all the changes that they’ll be making to the UV sound great, I’m angry that they won’t be happening sooner,” said Reagan Rose, a freshman majoring in mathematics. “Nearly everyone at USC right now won’t even be able to take advantage of the development because the construction will be happening so far away.”
Though the original estimated start of construction was Jan. 2012, it was recently changed to sometime between May 2013 to the end of 2013, according to Raspe.
It’s a free market economy, not sure why you people think USC controlling all major housing developments is a good idea. Or why it will result in cheaper rent for everyone without a drop in quality. You dont want to pay $1000/month for a shared apartment, dont live in gateway luxury housing  Competition = more choices, prices reflect market value
Sarah: Those two buildings would be extremely pricey to buy.  West 27th place just sold to a New York investment firm for rumored to be around ~$60 million, and Gateway would be much more to buy, considering it cost more than the Galen center to build.  It’s much cheaper for USC to build their own housing.  There are a lot of pro’s to this plan: first there will be more housing, a better UV will be created with more student options.
Tanya: USC really didn’t make the building possible.  The last was given to a developer by the same person who owns all the car dealerships north on Figueroa.  They just moved all the dealerships closer to Downtown and then a corporation came in to build the property, with USC’s blessing, but it would have gone ahead even without USC. 
Overall, its really supply and demand.  The more student housing available the cheaper prices will become.  Since Gateway opened prices have not climbed at the rate they once were.   
More housing = cheaper rent and more competition for better units.  It’s slowly changing.  The housing is much better now than it was 6 years ago.
“’USC housing is overpriced and charges way to* much money for everything,’ Urrea said.”
*TOO
USC should really buy the recently completed “high-end” MID-RISE housing, University Gateway and West 27th Place. These two developments are literally right across the street from campus and they charge us a huge amount of money to rent. Management here is extremely poor! If USC intervenes, the school can cheapen the rent, which will allow more students to afford to stay here! The rent per apartment can go up to $2000+, which is ridiculous. 
I also question this New Village development’s term of “affordable”. Many developers are using the same word, but once they complete their projects, they start charging students thousands to rent… as if we are celebrities!
More than half of the students who attend USC are on financial aid. Please, cater to their needs in terms of a rent! Because local landlords, who do not care about us, are now competing with escalating rent prices! For instance, STUHO Student Housing (one of the neighborhood’s worst landlords, but swear their housing is “high-end”).

Why not buy University Gateway and turn it into affordable student housing–USC made this building possible; why give developers USC students as renters,  for free? 
Seems silly.

The growing pains are expected.
Learning curve · Sophomore center Dewayne Dedmon scored just four points against Nebraska after recording 16 points in his USC debut. - Chris Pham | Daily Trojan
After dropping a double-overtime contest to Nebraska, the USC men’s basketball team has no time to think about what could have been, after squandering numerous opportunities to put the game away.
The USC men’s basketball team (1-1) will square off against San Diego State (3-1) tonight at the Viejas Arena in San Diego, Calif., at 7 p.m.
With such a young squad — nine players are either freshmen or sophomores and 10 did not play a single game for USC prior to this season — USC coach Kevin O’Neill understands the importance of getting his team focused on the next game because of a quick turnaround.
“We did everything but win the game [against Nebraska], and that’s unfortunate, but we have to get ready and play a turnaround game down at San Diego State,” O’Neill said. “It’s unfortunate we lost, but at the same time, I think we’re going to grow up from this. I think we’ll be a team that will get better because of it.”
Three of USC’s new faces — freshmen guards Alexis Moore and Byron Wesley and redshirt sophomore center Dewayne Dedmon — have all seen significant playing time in the Trojans’ first two contests. And each has had his moments of inconsistency.
Moore, after converting only 1-of-9 field goal attempts and committing two turnovers against Cal State Northridge, rebounded in his second game for USC against Nebraska, scoring 11 points.
Dedmon, on the other hand, committed two quick fouls in the first half against the Cornhuskers, forcing him to sit out nearly 10 minutes. After recording 16 points and eight rebounds in his USC debut against Northridge, he struggled against Nebraska, notching just four points on 1-of-6 shooting. Dedmon has been pegged as a lottery pick in next year’s NBA draft, but even though he is getting recognition, the coaching staff believes there is still much room for improvement.
“[Dedmon] has had so much publicity without ever really earning it,” O’Neill said. “And that’s no knock on him at all. He doesn’t like the publicity. He has huge potential. He’s going to be a huge-time player. He’s going to play for money some day. Having said that, he’s not there yet.”
The Trojans are going through a transition stage after losing senior guard Jio Fontan to a season-ending knee injury, but the Aztecs are in a similar position. They lost four of their leading scorers from last season, after compiling a 34-3 record before losing to eventual NCAA champion Connecticut in the Sweet 16 of the NCAA Tournament. Guard Chase Tapley is the lone player from last year’s squad with starting experience and is averaging almost 22 points per contest.
On the other side, the Trojans’ lone holdover starter, sophomore guard Maurice Jones, is still transitioning to his new role in the USC offense. Before Fontan went down, Jones envisioned himself as more of a facilitator. Now, Jones is expected to reprise his role from high school as a prolific point scorer.
“Coming to college, I got back into more just being a point guard trying to pass, but I have to turn back into high school mode and score more,” Jones said. “That’s been an adjustment for me.”
With USC playing its third game of seven within the first 16 days of the season, there is no time to dwell on tough losses. Six of these seven games will be against teams that finished with winning records last season.
“It was tough to lose, but what we need to do is regroup and get ready to keep going because there’s no real break in the schedule for a team like ours,” O’Neill said.

Once again, No. 4 Oregon boasts a high-powered offensive attack. The Ducks’ offense ranks third nationally in scoring, averaging 46.7 points per game, and ninth in total offense at 498.3 yards per contest heading into Saturday’s nationally-televised, primetime matchup against No. 18 USC. Here’s a look at three players and a coach who make the Ducks’ offense fly.
Quack attack · Darron Thomas, a dual-threat quarterback, is the leader under center for Oregon’s quick-strike offense this season. - Daily Trojan file photo
Running back LaMichael James
Though he began the year as a Heisman Trophy candidate, James rushed for just 54 yards and one touchdown on 18 carries in Oregon’s season opener against No. 1 LSU at Cowboys Stadium in Arlington, Tex., a 40-27 loss that dropped the Ducks to No. 14 in the USA Today coaches poll.
But since then, James has been electric.
Through eight games — including wins over then-No. 18 Arizona State and then-No. 4 Stanford — the Texas native has rushed for 1,207 yards and 12 touchdowns, averaging 7.9 yards per carry and vaulting himself back into consideration for the Heisman Trophy. A recent Sports Illustrated projection ranked James No. 6 in the Heisman race.
The 5-foot-9 running back has proven problematic for USC before. In a 53-22 win over the Trojans last season at the Coliseum, he amassed 239 yards and three touchdowns on the ground on 36 carries. Similarly, in a 47-20 win over USC at Autzen Stadium in 2009, James, then a freshman, ran for 183 yards and a touchdown.
 
Running back De’Anthony Thomas 
De’Anthony Thomas, a one-time USC commit who spurned the Trojans last February to sign a letter of intent to play for Oregon, has made an immediate impact in just his first year with the program.
Appearing in 10 games, the former Crenshaw High standout has rushed for 366 yards and five touchdowns in addition to leading the Ducks in receiving with 27 catches for 423 yards and seven touchdowns, though standing at just 5-foot-9 and 160 pounds.
“The only guy that I’ve probably seen like that was Reggie [Bush],” USC coach Lane Kiffin said following Tuesday’s practice when asked about Thomas’ explosiveness. “The way that he can start and stop and then how fast he can cut is really special. That’s why he may be the best player in the country.”
 
Quarterback Darron Thomas
Though many of the Ducks’ SportsCenter highlights tend to center around either James or De’Anthony Thomas, junior quarterback Darron Thomas, is the trigger man for the Ducks’ offensive attack.
Taking over under center in 2010 after Jeremiah Masoli was dismissed from the team after being cited for misdemeanor traffic and drug offenses, including possession of marijuana, Darron Thomas completed 61.5 percent of his passes for 30 touchdowns, playing an instrumental role in the Ducks’ undefeated regular season and appearance in the BCS national title game.
This season, Darron Thomas has been just as impressive, with a touchdown-to-interception ratio of 22:5 in addition to two rushing touchdowns.
 
Coach Chip Kelly
Since taking over in 2009 for Mike Bellotti, who served as coach for 14 years, Kelly has only built upon the success of his predecessor, winning 31 of his first 36 games, including two Pac-12 championships.
Kelly’s potent spread offense has made the Ducks near-impossible to stop at times. Last season, they ranked first nationally in scoring offense and eighth in the season prior.
Perhaps most important to USC, Kelly is 2-0 against the Trojans, with wins against both Kiffin and former USC coach Pete Carroll.
“You hope anytime that you play somebody that you learn from it and get better,” Kiffin said about last season’s loss to the Ducks. “And we’ll continue to do what we’ve done in general this year, which is play more guys and rotate guys in and make sure that we’re getting lined up.”

Elite college football programs show unwavering class and respect in defeat and victory.
For Oregon, most of its players are doing their part. In fact, all but one of Oregon’s players appear to carry themselves with an elegance appropriate for a team that has a shot to play in consecutive BCS national championship games.
But running back De’Anthony Thomas doesn’t appear to be following that line of thought.
“I wouldn’t want to play us right now,” he told reporters earlier this week. “We scored the most points [on No. 1 LSU], so I feel like we deserve another chance to play against them again.”
Really? More so than No. 2 Oklahoma State at 10-0, with an offense just as imposing as yours?
Remember, it wasn’t so long ago that Thomas coughed up the football twice in the Ducks’ season opener against LSU.
It’s human nature that spurs a player to get ahead of himself like that, but it’s immaturity that prevents him from keeping it to himself. Oregon coach Chip Kelly and tailback LaMichael James, however, insisted their focus is on USC, not on LSU. Oregon has two regular season games left, including Saturday’s matchup against USC, but Thomas’ story would suggest an easy path to the BCS title game.
Though Thomas characterized his team’s matchup against the Trojans as “just another game,” you can bet it’s a lot more than that to him and his once-prospective teammates.
Yes, it was Los Angeles native and five-star recruit Thomas who committed to play for USC before mysteriously defecting to join Oregon in the 11th hour. If you’re a Trojan player, you’d have to be brain-dead to forget that.
In fairness, Thomas is likely not concerned with the Ducks’ public relations goals, but his comments regarding LSU presuppose that he’s quick to dismiss the Trojans as a legitimate threat to the Ducks — if only to taunt them a little bit.
The only redemption to be found in Thomas’ behavior is the reassurance it was the right move for both sides for him to play at Oregon.
The Trojans still have a chance, however, to show Thomas what he missed.
USC’s leaders show a special sensitivity to improper behavior — with a mind on the lack of control just a few years ago.
It’s interesting: The sanctions that were likely the driving force behind Thomas’ departure from the university are what created the structured environment at USC that would have been great for him. And he’ll get a taste of what this discipline yields on Saturday.
USC will face improbable odds Saturday, and some would say Las Vegas’ appraisal of the Trojans’ chances isn’t bleak enough, especially now that sophomore receiver Robert Woods might not play.
But my downward outlook on USC’s shot of defeating Stanford last month has taught me to not be so negative this time around. Oregon, however, certainly seems to be an even better team than Stanford was.
If USC can stay fresh and stop Oregon on third downs, it’s capable of anything, especially with the extra motivation to stick it to Thomas for abandoning the program.

I think it’s great that the journalistic commuity holds our team to standards higher than our opponents .  I also think it’s great that we have a quarterback who was just repremanded by the PAC-12 for his comments on Birfect and then proceeded to take it further by giving Oregon bulletin board fodder for saying that their team isn’t as good as last years.  Elite college football programs show unwavering class and respect in defeat and victory.  Yes, elitism and klass are noble qualities.  Thanks for your support.

Injuries have taken their toll on USC this season, but the Trojans have been able to play well despite the circumstances.
Question mark · Sophomore wide receiver Robert Woods could miss Saturday’s contest at Oregon with shoulder and ankle injuries. Woods leads the Trojans and ranks in the top 10 nationally with 92 receptions, 1,126 yards and 11 touchdowns this season. - Kevin Nguyen | Daily Trojan
Saturday at Oregon, USC could be without key starter sophomore wide receiver Robert Woods because of nagging shoulder and ankle injuries. Woods did not participate in Wednesday’s practice, and for some time now, according to the coaching staff, his injuries have affected his performance, and his health isn’t getting any better.
“If you just look at the last two games and if you look yesterday at practice, he’s going the wrong direction,” USC coach Lane Kiffin said. “Even though we limited his practice, he’s not getting better. So hopefully this will help. If he can’t go this week, at least the time off and the weekend off hopefully he’ll be back close to full speed for UCLA.”
Kiffin said there is a real possibility of Woods sitting out against the Ducks. Replacing him, however, won’t be easy. Woods has recorded 92 receptions for 1,126 yards and 11 touchdowns this season, but against Washington, he was held to a career-low two receptions and five yards. Though Woods plays a significant role in the Trojans’ offense, the coaching staff believes other players will be able to step up in his absence.
“There’s no secret that affects us,” Kiffin said. “A guy that’s caught over 90 balls and you’re losing him — but we need guys to step up. That’s why these guys practice hard all year long and they’ll get their chance. Last week Brice Butler made a big play for us early and the other guys need to step up.”
Woods wasn’t the only player sitting out or limited in practice on Wednesday. Senior defensive tackle DaJohn Harris did not practice, while fellow senior defensive tackle Christian Tupou was very limited. Other notable absences were sophomore safety Demetrius Wright, redshirt junior offensive tackle Matt Kalil and freshman offensive tackle Aundrey Walker.
“George [Uko] played really well last week in his first start as a freshman. And so did J.R. [Tavai] as a true freshman,” Kiffin said. “But obviously we’d like to have DaJohn back because of the rotation especially because obviously we want to get a bunch of guys in there and rotate them through. Hopefully he’ll be back and be able to play some for us.”

The setup looks a little familiar.
USC takes on one of the nation’s top teams from the Pac-12 North division that has national championship aspirations and a Heisman Trophy candidate on national television.
Three weeks ago against Stanford, USC went wire-to-wire with the Cardinal before falling short in triple overtime.
Fast-forward to the present, and USC finds itself in a similar predicament. This time, it will face Oregon at Autzen Stadium, a daunting task for anybody, given the fact that the Ducks have not lost a conference home game since Dec. 1, 2007.
Kiffin, however, insists his young squad is ready.
“We’re a lot more [prepared],” Kiffin said. “Going through Arizona State and Notre Dame has really helped them. I think that they’re a lot more comfortable.”

The Civil Wars
This is not by any means a history lesson — at long last, we’ve escaped the days of AP U.S. History — but instead a folk-meets-country musical sensation on the rise.
Composed of Joy Williams and John Paul White, the fantastic folk duo elicits simple acoustics, beautiful harmonies and emotive lyrics that speak to listeners with their honesty and simplicity, inciting praise from the country princess herself, Taylor Swift.
In an ambiguous address to a potential lover, for example, “To Whom It May Concern,” Williams and White harmoniously croon, I’ve missed you / But I haven’t met you / Oh but I want to / How I do.
This is only a mere representation of the emotional depth and beautifully simplistic acoustics, also found in notable tracks “Poison & Wine” and “Falling,” spread abundantly throughout the pair’s first full length album, Barton Hallow.
The Civil Wars — a true folk sensation to be reckoned with — will perform at The Wiltern Saturday at 7:30 p.m. Tickets start at $20 and are available on Ticketmaster.
Argentine Film Festival

This 10th annual festival, held at the Egyptian Theatre, will feature modern hits such as My First Wedding on Thursday night, Aballay! and No Return on Friday night and The Student and The Finger on Saturday night.
Most notable is the screening of Fernando Spiner’s Aballay!, which is Argentina’s official Oscar submission for 2011’s Best Foreign Language Film.
Moreover, directors Ariel Winograd (My First Wedding), Fernando Spiner (Aballay!) and Sergio Teubal (The Finger) will make appearances — act now and get your tickets to see these Argentine sensations in person.
Tickets are available on the Egyptian Theatre’s website with general admission running for $11.
“How Los Angeles Invented the World”
Functioning as a complement to the Getty’s “Pacific Standard Time: Art in L.A. 1945-1980,” Zocalo Public Square will be hosting “How Los Angeles Invented the World.”
The event, which will be a half-day conference for talking heads, will take place in the Harold M. Williams Auditorium at the Getty Center, and will explicate how and why the world at large has become so obsessed with L.A. culture.
Topics will include everything lifestyle, from music to film. Subjects will feature specifically historical points of interest, such as L.A. natives The Beach Boys and the various depictions of Los Angeles in art, photography and cinema.
The event’s goal is to shed the cultural spotlight on a city purportedly bereft of culture.
Contrary to that vapid misconception, Los Angeles is full of astounding and inspiring art. Check out the Getty Center on Nov. 20 to get your weekly dose of culture.
Early check-in is recommended — free with reservations at  www.getty.edu.
David Sedaris
Bookworms and comedy fans unite and rejoice — the best of both worlds is coming to Northridge.
This Sunday at 7 p.m., the notorious David Sedaris, without a doubt one of America’s funniest authors, will be making his way to the Valley Performing Arts Center for a reading.
Currently on tour, reading from his most recent collection Squirrel Seeks Chipmunk: A Modest Bestiary, Sedaris is sure to enthrall audiences with his quirky turns of phrase, vividly inappropriate imagery and ridiculous but satisfying stories.
Whether you’re already a fan of Sedaris or not, you won’t want to miss out on this opportunity to catch him on this leg of his tour. As a bonus, Sedaris often uses his audiences as subconscious workshoppers for his writing — meaning he might test out new material or re-read some of his funniest classics.
Tickets for the event can range from $25-$75 and can be purchased at
www.valleyperformingartscenter.org.

Now that “Pacific Standard Time: Art in L.A. 1945-1980” is in full swing, new exhibitions are popping up left and right as part of the initiative. So it comes as no surprise that choosing from the many exhibitions under the umbrella of this new project might seem overwhelming.
But an easy way to experience this huge undertaking is by visiting one of the most intimate and hip museums near campus, the Geffen Contemporary at MOCA. A stone’s throw away from Little Tokyo, the museum is associated with the MOCA and was once a warehouse for police cars before being remodeled by legendary architect Frank O. Gehry.
The museum has housed a number of exciting and bold exhibitions, such as “Suprasensorial,” which included everything from brightly lit rooms you could walk through to a shallow, lit pool you could swim in; and “Art in the Streets,” an impressive collection of work from street artists, such as Banksy and Mister Cartoon.
The MOCA Geffen, then, is like MOCA’s kid sister — a spunky locale that is always changing its exhibitions.
Currently on display is an ambitious, intriguing exhibition no Angeleno should miss. “Under the Big Black Sun: California Art 1974-1981” might sound like the title for an apocalyptic movie, but it is in fact an adventurous look into the art in California during this time frame.
There’s hardly any connection between the pieces except for the time period, which might make the exhibition seem like a haphazard trip at first. But it’s a little like Disneyland — if you relax and go with it, you end up feeling the magic.
Stand in front of Judy Chicago’s “Rejection Quintet” and you are quickly thrown into the thoughts and personal experiences of this very important artist — important because she tracks the gender struggle within the art world. The pieces are overtly based on the female sex organ, but don’t shy away from them based just on that. Chicago’s shading is exquisite. Though her works form one cohesive whole, they still stand out as individual pieces.
Many of the pieces comment on the major movements and figures of the time. Raymond Pettibon’s posters for the punk rock band Black Flag take up an entire wall, becoming a dizzying flurry of black and white. It’s an authentic punk rock look that any other artist would be hard-pressed to re-create with the same originality.
Explore the exhibition more and you come across everything from a small room filled with a bright purple light to a video with a television showing bees on a man’s face while the sound of insects buzzing plays loudly over the speakers.
At first the sleek white walls and glass doors of the Geffen might make it somewhat daunting, but each art piece has a way of sucking you into its respective world, making you crave more.
“Under the Big Black Sun” manages to encompass what feels like the very spirit of the MOCA Geffen — a volition to create exhibitions that call for the viewer to truly interact. Even “Art in the Streets” was interactive; the graffiti artists Os Gemeos’ exhibition featured instruments for everyone to play.
Even in showcasing works from decades ago, the MOCA Geffen furthers the curatorial practices of today, challenging and exploring the ways in which art is exhibited. Though the MOCA also has new exhibitions at its location, it houses permanent exhibitions as well. It’s the Geffen that changes completely every time a new exhibition is put on display.
This means you might miss a show you really want to see, but it might also prove that, save for the adventurous spirit of the museum, nothing really remains the same for too long. It’s impressive when museums can showcase important and classic works they’ve acquired through collections, but the Geffen’s ability to change so frequently and radically makes it even more addictive.
Downtown Los Angeles has plenty to offer in terms of food, entertainment and art and the MOCA Geffen, along with “Under the Big Black Sun,” is another gem you shouldn’t leave unexplored.

This time last year, Janet Krupin was just a senior walking around USC’s campus.
Fresh face · Alumna Janet Krupin immediately jumped into theater after graduating, working her way to the top alongside her talented cast members in a theatrical take on Bring It On: The Musical. - Photo courtesy of Craig Schwartz
As a critical studies major in the School of Cinematic Arts with minors in musical theatre and philosophy, she took on more work than most. And to top it all off, she was a working actress, auditioning for theater roles all over Los Angeles.
Her work appears to have paid off — she now has a lead role of Kylar in the national tour of Bring It On: The Musical, which will visit 13 cities over the span of seven months.
Krupin’s path to success was not always clear. She had a self-professed period of ambiguity during her early years at USC. She came to school as a film student because, according to her, when you get into USC’s film school, you don’t say no.
But not being able to pursue her passion for theater took a toll on Krupin. During her sophomore year, she decided to make a change.
“I kind of said, ‘Hold up, I’m missing something,’ and I added a musical theatre minor.” Krupin said. “It really made me realize what I actually like to do every day when I wake up.”
In her junior year, she began actively pursuing a career in performance.
“I just started auditioning for very small non-union roles close to USC.” Krupin said. “It started with those small roles, then a slightly bigger role. All of a sudden it was my senior year, and in my second semester I had a professional agent, I got my Equity card and I auditioned for Bring It On: [The Musical].”
The road to Bring It On: The Musical was not an easy one. Krupin endured an extensive audition process that spanned from March 2010 to June 2010, which took place in New York City and Los Angeles. Following four days of auditions in Los Angeles, she was told not to book any other jobs because the producers were interested in her.
Two months later, Krupin was in New York City for a two-day callback.
“I was actually called back for three parts,” Krupin said. “There was a heck of a lot of preparation that went into it.”
This all occurred while she was trying to earn her degree, which was a tricky balancing act.
“It was pretty crazy running from some callbacks into my second science credit, which I had put off taking,” Krupin said. “It was pretty surreal to be at a callback with Tony [Award] winners and then run back to campus for my four o’clock science class.”
But the balancing act was worth it. Krupin, who started working as a performer immediately after graduation — a feat not many students, let alone actors, can say they have accomplished.
Bring It On: The Musical, loosely based on 2000’s movie Bring It On, opened to favorable reviews in Atlanta earlier this year. Krupin says the show has only improved since its initial run.
“This show was amazing in Atlanta and it’s even better now. Andy Blankenbuehler, who is our director and choreographer, [is] brilliant,” Krupin said. “And Andy has amped up every single dance number in this show. You’re just going to love it.”
Looking back, she credits her years at USC as integral to her personal growth.
“My journey at USC, being confused about exactly what I wanted, being confused on exactly how to get what I wanted — I learned that being the best means doing what you love every day,” Krupin said.
As for current aspiring performers at USC, Krupin suggests taking it one step at a time.
“To that underclassman who’s reading this article that doesn’t know how the heck they’re going to make it happen — just do it,” Krupin said. “Just start doing it and it’ll work out.”

Gleeks everywhere this holiday season are getting an early Christmas present with Glee: The Music, The Christmas Album Volume 2. Despite some forgettable covers and lackluster original songs, this album provides the finger-snapping and grin-inducing Christmas tunes one can expect from the voices of Glee.
There is no better way to start off the season than with a vivacious cover by the ultimate diva herself: Mercedes (Amber Riley). In a tribute to Mariah Carey, Mercedes provides a myriad of vocal riffs, soaring notes and power with her rendition of “All I Want For Christmas Is You.”
Santana (Naya Rivera) lends her sultry voice to the holiday hit “Santa Baby,” making the lyrics I’ve been an awful good girl seem a little too ironic in the process. Perhaps to counteract the overt sexuality, Glee’s power couple Kurt (Chris Colfer) and Blaine (Darren Criss) charmingly sing “Let It Snow,” in which perfect harmonies put their previous Christmas duet of “Baby It’s Cold Outside” to shame.
Even Glee’s newest characters have taken their rightful place on the album, in which Harmony (Lindsay Pearce) and Alex Newell, whose character has not yet been introduced, contribute their powerful soprano ranges to “Do You Hear What I Hear?” The gospel choir and mellifluousness are sure to give you chills if you crave those spiritual songs to celebrate Christmas.
Other newcomer Rory (Damian McGinty) will certainly melt the hearts of teenage girls everywhere with his smooth jazz vocals in “Blue Christmas.” Instead of the country twang with which Elvis Presley made this song a holiday classic, Rory works a fluid jazz melody accentuated by a flawless piano accompaniment. If you’re looking to snuggle by the fireside with a cup of hot cider and a blanket for two, this is the song to set the mood.
Some of the more lackluster songs on the album include two original songs: “Extraordinary Merry Christmas” and “Christmas Eve With You.” Though credit should be given for attempting to contribute original pieces, these tunes simply sound like recomposed sound bytes from other holiday hits.
In “Extraordinary Merry Christmas,” Blaine (Darren Criss) and Rachel (Lea Michelle) sing about Santa Claus, kissing under the mistletoe and coming inside from the snow because it’s a very, very merry Christmas. There’s nothing particularly original about it — the piece sounds like a poor Kidz Bop rendition of a song that does little to show off the vocalists’ skills.
Similarly, Will Schuester (Mathew Morrison) and Emma Pillsbury (Jayma Mays) croon to the sweet melody of “Christmas Eve With You.” The entire chorus, however, is let it snow, let it snow, let it snow — sound familiar?
To top it off, singing through the good times and the bad, happy or sad to round off the chorus ends up sounding an awful lot like Al Green’s “Let’s Stay Together.” Though it is an endearing duet with delicate vocals, this song is a forgettable tune lacking inspiration.
Other songs that fail to impress are Artie’s (Kevin McHale) version of “Little Drummer Boy” and “Santa Claus Is Coming To Town,” sung by the boys of Glee’s very own a cappella group, New Directions. The former is unmemorable, featuring more drums and guitar solos than Artie’s voice, and the latter holiday hit flaunts a modern rock and roll vibe complete with sexy, masculine harmonies. The tune introduces Samuel Larsen, winner of The Glee Project, whose character has yet to be introduced on the show.
Unfortunately, Larsen’s voice is so indistinct one could only try to guess it was him singing. If Glee producers are seeking to establish Larsen’s character, perhaps they should have given him a song to himself like they did with McGinty.
What the album does right is provide variety. This is especially true with Rachel’s rendition of Joni Mitchell’s heartfelt classic “River,” which reflects on the escape from the pain of a lost relationship. It is a beautiful and effortless interpretation, although it lacks the typical vocal power one would expect from the songstress.
Glee: The Music, The Christmas Album Volume 2 has songs perfect for kissing under the mistletoe, unwrapping presents, snuggling by a fire or even slipping into loneliness. Despite some less familiar tunes than the first volume, this album will put listeners in the undeniable Christmas spirit.
I think you’d enjoy Duwende’s A Cappella version of “Little Drummer Boy”.  They also do amazing Micheal Jackson covers.

· Various players were in yellow-no-contact jerseys, including redshirt freshmen linebackers Dion Bailey and Hayes Pullard, as well as senior tailback Marc Tyler. Sophomore wide receiver Robert Woods participated briefly but did not practice the rest of the day, putting his availability for Saturday in jeopardy.
· The defense placed an emphasis on conditioning today to prepare for the hurry up offense Oregon runs.
· The receivers worked with their position coach, Ted Gilmore, focusing on their release from routes.
· During the first set of 11-on-11, the defense had the upper hand, stuffing a couple of runs and deflecting a few passes to keep the offense in check.
· Oregon’s fight song and other noise was piped in to simulate the environment at Autzen Stadium.
“I don’t know how ready you can get to play in that place,” said defensive coordinator Ed Orgeron. “It’s a tough place to play. It reminds me of an SEC crowd.”
Furthermore, Orgeron noted that the defense has been very motivated on its own for the big showdown.
· The backs had their work too, as junior tailback Curtis McNeal cut up the defense on a runs. He ranks near the top of the Pac-12 in yards per carry.
· The play of the day came during situational 11-on-11 drills, where senior linebacker Shane Horton dove for a deflected pass and intercepted Barkley.

Opinion misguided and lacked research
I found “Identification unnecessary in political realm, Nov. 15” extremely offensive. It smacks of intolerance, ignorance and even outright hostility to the transgender community. Its misleading title provides a taste of the issues within.
The author (along with much of the general populace) lacks a clear understanding of transgender issues. First off, transgender people do not “redefine their gender,” as the article offensively argues.
Gender is by definition a social construct and is not related to the biological concept of sex. Many transgender people identify with a certain gender from a young age, making any “redefinition” impossible. This anomaly is only the beginning.
The author willingly ignores reality in her quest to focus on “larger problems.” If she considered that 27 people were murdered in 2010 on the basis of their perceived or actual LGBT identity, perhaps she would see differently. Instead, she argues for more tolerance of intolerance — that is, respect for anti-transgender sentiment and hate speech. She accepts bigotry as the standard, saying intolerance is “just reality.”
It would be easier to refute the author’s perspective if she had formed a coherent opinion. She first claims to support universal rights and a world without discrimination. Yet she goes on to castigate an entire demographic for their supposed “personal choices.”
She seems to suggest that transgender people make decisions on a whim, fulfilling the stereotype of fickle and superficial gay people broadcast in popular media. Her tone ultimately proves condescending. To tell transgender people they “need to be aware of the effects of such decisions” is not a revelation to any member of that demographic. Clearly, one does not define one’s gender easily or hastily.
Social issues aside, the author commits grave errors in her exploration of the political and legal aspects of the issue. The passing reference to two important California laws indicates she did not actually study them in any detail. As a result, the author frames the issue in a misleading way.
She creates a false dilemma between support for minority rights and support for transgender rights, refusing to recognize the interdependent relationship between the two.
One cannot support racial tolerance while castigating people for their gender identity. Her approach is ultimately offensive because of its hypocrisy.
Salama is fully entitled to her opinion, and can be forgiven for factual mistakes. After all, most of us know very little about transgender issues and continue to learn about them with good intentions.
The Daily Trojan, however is not a forum for people to write cluelessly about sensitive topics. Salama is not qualified to speak on transgender issues.
Our student newspaper should represent fairly the views of students, and commit itself to factual integrity. Articles such as these paint a very poor picture of our campus community and the character of our students.
I hope that, in the future, the Daily Trojan will publish more open-minded and tactful opinion pieces.

Sophomore, East Asian area studies
Suni, first off, I am male. Second, I did not actively choose to crusade for this cause – it happened that someone spoke out ignorantly about this issue and I decided to respond with refuting facts.
I did not, at any point, level any personal attacks against the author. I criticized her style and approach, while recognizing that we all make mistakes. The measure of a responsible writer is to learn from them and hopefully address them somehow. I trust the author has learned something from the widespread outcry against her article – either to consider their objections, or reformulate her argument to make it more compelling and reasonable. Whatever the case, there is nothing defensible about unsubstantiated and vitriolic arguments, and they deserve to be criticized.
I also did not claim to have a perfect understanding of science, nor that the science was fully established. Rather, I suggested that her particular claims were invalid according to anyone of authority on this issue. If you object to mainstream scientific findings, I am not the person to talk to.
Nobody wants to argue with you, Ms. Penk, because it is incumbent upon you to make your argument compelling – not everybody else to defend the natural order and accepted societal constructs.
Even though I am not sympathetic to your cause, I am interested in your mission to persuade people on behalf of your cause. My strategic advice: don’t call people bigots, intolerant, and ignorant – nor claim that science is irrefutably on your side. These aspects hurt your case.
People take pride in their shame – it’s been chronicled through history. Make sure you know who you’re fighting for.
Suni Ellis
Steve, I believe you have the wrong impression of my letter. I fully support the right of journalists to express their views in a civil and informed fashion. However, the original piece showed a clear lack of research, unfounded and fallacious arguments, and comments bordering on hate speech.
Despite those serious flaws, the First Amendment protects her freedom of expression, as it should. Thus it is the journalistic and moral responsibility of Daily Trojan authors and editors to check her basic facts and question her underlying assumptions. Her writing, as with any published content, is subject to extensive revision. Any objective journalist would have pulled the plug on this article, or at least brought it back to the drawing board until it could be salvaged. The review process clearly broke down at some point.
All this goes without mentioning the actual issues discussed in the article.
If we examine the nature of student opinion, comments on the article indicated an overwhelming opposition to the views she expressed. If anyone strongly supported her argument, perhaps they would have written a thoughtful defense. I imagine that, since the newspaper had the nerve to publish the original opinion piece, they would be equally willing to broadcast a well-written supporting letter.
Yet even if students forcefully endorsed transphobia, the Daily Trojan reserves the right to do the right thing. It receives no funding from the University and is not accountable to student opinion.
I simply hope for them to take the higher ground.
Basically what the letter says is “the Daily Trojan should only publish things that I agree with”.  Which has been the overall theme of this “controversy”. For a student body that beats its collective chest so often about diversity, it’s hypocritical to only allow for diversity that a few students agree on. Whether or not you agree with the original article, it’s absolutely ridiculous to say it shouldn’t be published. I don’t know why I expect anything more from the Jon Stewart/Stephen Colbert generation, but I guess I do. It just sets me up to be constantly disappointed.
Thank you very much for your letter. The Daily Trojan executive staff members do not seem to understand what is going on. I hope the paper did not publish that ridiculous opinion piece to increase readership of the paper. DT is not MTV and no need to create a show like “Jersey Shore.” I understand readership of DT has declined over the years because of its poor contents that are unrelated to students but creating controversy is not the way to increase readership. Why don’t you learn from Oprah Winfrey and continue the paper with “good intention” without worrying about readership? When your readers feel the connection with DT, then more people will read your paper. 
Regardless, I highly recommend DT to issue a statement regarding the controversy.

I rarely expect heated responses to my column. Topics like programming, statistics and internet slang don’t exactly pull at the heartstrings.
Jovanna Tosello | Daily Trojan
A month ago, though, the comment section on one of many columns turned into an argument about the possible fabrication of the Holocaust.
The link between that column and the Holocaust was weak at best, so I chalked the incident up to a fluke. That’s why I was surprised when yet another Holocaust-related comment surfaced under my column last week.
I’m all for asking uncomfortable questions, but I wonder if these comments would’ve been made with more tact if the commenters knew that I’m Jewish.
The Internet exposes the best and worst in us all. It’s anonymous, so people express themselves with uninhibited creativity.
The products of that creativity range from funny to bizarre to downright beautiful.
But anonymity has a flip side. When you’re sitting behind a screen, you don’t have to see the real-time impact of what you say.
It’s easy to avoid accountability for your statements. It’s easy to forget you’re communicating with other human beings.
In that sense, the Internet is a magnifying glass for people’s underlying bigotry. When they’re online, people take views they would suppress in day-to-day life and supersize them.
For a live demonstration of this phenomenon, post a video on YouTube involving one of the following topics: race, religion, sexual orientation or gender identity. Make sure the video really spreads. Then, sit back and watch the comments roll in.
Hundreds of examples are readily available. About one month ago, a gay soldier named Randy Phillips came out to his father and uploaded the video on YouTube.
Outright homophobia is becoming less and less acceptable throughout the United States; not surprisingly, most traditional media outlets praised Phillips or otherwise showed restraint. But Phillips’ actual videos are filled with comments like, “You need to be locked up for molesting children.” That’s one of the more tame ones.
If you see a viewpoint that makes you angry, write a blog post and respectfully advocate the opposite view. Put a song on MySpace. Make a video. Make a Facebook status, even.
It’s not as though YouTube moderators don’t track Phillips’ channel. Plenty of comments have been removed. In fact, the site has an entire page devoted to reporting hateful comments.
But there are too many YouTube videos — and too many commenters — for moderating to be effective.
For the most part, outrageous Internet bigotry doesn’t translate to offline action. Social norms and potential repercussions hold many people back. Bigots often turn to the Internet precisely because they lack support in real life.
Unfortunately, the discrepancy between online and offline bigotry is merely cold comfort.
We have to ask ourselves what we’re willing to do to discourage the haters.
All legal and moral arguments aside, using internet censorship to curb hate is impractical. More than two billion people use to the Internet.
Even if websites like YouTube were successful at moderating content — and they’re not — people could simply create their own blogs, networks and forums.
Responding to comments isn’t helpful, either. If someone’s anonymous statement didn’t change your mind, why should he or she care about yours?
The most productive way to curb bigotry is to continue to put out positive content.
Phillips delivered his message with great success: Beyond spurring a national conversation on homosexuality, he made gay rights a campaign issue. Presidential candidates who disrespected him were called out for failing to recognize his sacrifices as a soldier.
Don’t be anonymous: Show that you’re willing to stand up for your values once you leave the Internet.
To be clear, I’m not discouraging controversial viewpoints. If you want to respectfully oppose various social issues or examine the history of the Holocaust, be my guest. Just say your name and maintain some tact.
 
Maya Itah is a senior majoring in communication. Her column “From Behind the Screen” runs Thursdays.
Tact, along with willingness to put one’s life, fortune, and sacred honor on the line where it isn’t necessary, take secondary importance after one has been made the victim of a vicious (anonymous) online smear campaign. Will I (once I have been stripped, as I have been, of my reputation and associations having no connection whatsoever to the Holocaust) stand up for what I believe? Yes, and I did, proudly and foolishly.
But I realize that others (my wife, children, others who can be linked to me) will ALSO be savaged in the campaign of repression that is maintained as constantly as the pressure in my water pipes to suppress thought and discussion on the Holocaust. There, I draw the line. Even the Signers didn’t pledge their wives and children. So, like my attackers, I remain anonymous (I certainly WOULD like to get them to stand up for their attacks on me in person).
This noted, I’d like to make it clear that Maya Itah (Jewish like me) has herself NEVER given offense of this kind, nor defended those who do. Thoughtfully and articulately, she has BROUGHT UP subjects that (like most subjects, to me, I admit) CONNECT to Holocaust history and the strife about it. Even now, she advances nothing worse than naive, idealistic advice to eschew anonymity.
Alexander Hamilton, Thomas Paine, James Madison and others since lionized by history relied on anonymity to publish works that now serve in many places as holy writ. I hope to be no worse than they – opposed as I am by vicious and underhanded enemies, who are, no doubt, but a tiny minority of those who disagree with me.

No matter how hard the world tries to forget her, it always seems to go back to Black. Like a bad horror movie sequel, Rebecca Black is at it again with a new song and another shot at fame.
First, “Friday” blew up this past spring. With the obnoxious lyrics and unforgettable tune, Black sure made an impression on not only the Internet community, but most news sources and eventually the population at large.
She had stints on Good Morning America, performances and interviews all over broadcast television. She popped up on Katy Perry’s California Dreams Tour to sing her hit with Perry and 10,000 screaming fans
Then, everything seemed to calm down, until the fateful day that she released “My Moment” as her follow-up single to “Friday.” The worst part about the song: people actually gave it credit. It was praised as an improvement to “Friday,” being more radio-friendly and mature. The bottom line, however, is that the song is just as poorly produced as its predecessor. It was released along with a music video and extended her 15 minutes of fame.
So, Rebecca Black has become a household name. Katy Perry put her on a pedestal with current Glee stars and ’80s icons in her “Last Friday Night” music video. She’s more than just a YouTube star now; she has industry experience and commercial viability.
As if to solidify this, Black’s camp has released another song, “P.O.I. (Person of Interest).” The song itself lacks any emotion whatsoever and features equally uninspired crimescene-esque lyrics like “there’s a chalk line on the dance floor / in the shape of my heart.” It is actually quite painful to listen to the whole song play out — more so when you watch the 14-year-old singer struggle on the camera in the music video with her equally as awkward co-stars.
Just like “My Moment,” the issue with “P.O.I” is that people are applauding it. One of the most influential music industry publication, Billboard, calls the song “criminally fun” and even likens the tune to Cascada’s “Evacuate the Dancefloor.”  The more exposure Black gets, the more people seem to warm up to her story, her efforts and her seemingly effervescent personality.
The message here is that Black is going to keep on pumping out songs until she’s out of cash and a fanbase. But by the look of her website she’s in it to win it, merch store and all.

After exacting revenge on Washington, a team that beat them each of the last two years, the USC Trojans will head north in search of similar success against the high-powered No. 4 Oregon Ducks. The Ducks have quite a few eye opening statistics.
First off, Oregon ranks 5th nationally in rush yards per game with 291.80. The Ducks are 1st in yards per carry, averaging 6.79yards each time one of their ball carriers takes a hand off. The most dynamic of these rushers is running back LaMichael James, who leads the nation in rush yards per game with 150.88. USC has fared well against the run this year, holding opponents to only100.4 yards per game on the ground, good for 8th nationally.
To make matters worse for USC, Oregon has proved to be next to unbeatable at home. The Ducks last loss at Autzen Stadium wasSeptember 20, 2008 when they fell to Boise State 37-32. Since then, Oregon has reeled off 21 consecutive home victories. Since taking over the program in 2009, Ducks head coach Chip Kelly is undefeated at Autzen.
Perhaps most impressively, each of Oregon’s 9 victories in 2011 have come by an average of 29.2 points. No team has come within14 points of the Ducks. The opening line for Saturday’s ball game pits Oregon as a 15-point favorite. If the past few weeks have been any indication, Oregon should roll. USC must limit the run game as they’ve done all year and hope for the best in the stormy conditions forecasted for Saturday. Oregon is the hottest team in the country. The Trojans will need to play extremely well to best the Ducks this weekend.

In an interview for Australian show 60 Minutes, Brad Pitt stated that he would like to act for another three years, when he turns 50. When pressed on the matter, the actor said that he was enjoying his role as a producer and saw his future as being behind the camera. The interview, shot in Tokyo on Nov. 15, was a part of the marketing push for his latest movie Moneyball.
Unsurprisingly, the statement caused many a Hollywood jaw to drop. So, the actor took some time out from a press conference the next day in Korea to clarify the retirement talk. However, he did reiterate his desire to move toward the production side of filmmaking.

Today, Google is expected to announce the release of downloads to its Music Beta streaming service at an event in Los Angeles. The only problem: Many major record labels are not yet on board.
Universal Music Group is scheduled to complete its contract with the online superpower today, so expect to see your favorite Universal artists on the site. However, Warner Music Group and Sony/BMG have not completed contracts. And with Sony’s recent acquisition of EMI’s publishing, there will be a lot of acts not appearing on the Google service.
To make up for the lack of big names that will appear on the service, Google is setting up a big time event for the release.  Mr. Brainwash — the “artist” depicted in the provocative documentary “Exit Through the Gift Shop” — will host the event in his private studio and the Android Youtube channel will broadcast the happenings.
The issues that arise with the launch of the downloading service is that iTunes will still have an edge over Google. With the lack of artists on Google’s service, consumers will most likely stick with the Apple music store because virtually every artists is available there.
Google’s music downloading service now has to compete with Apple’s new Match service and the Cloud.
