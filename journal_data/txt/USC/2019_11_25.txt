The USC women’s volleyball team split its weekend matchups against conference opponents, defeating Oregon State and losing to Oregon at Galen Center this weekend. 
The Trojans came out dominant against OSU and took the first two sets, picking up three straight runs of at least 5 points in the first. Freshman outside hitter Emilia Weske had 10 kills through the first two frames of the match. 
The Trojans let the Beavers right back into the match in the third and fourth sets. USC led six different times in the fourth but wasn’t able to close it out. 
However, in a back-and-forth fifth set, the Trojans came out on top 15-13 to avoid a disastrous loss. 
It was USC’s ninth straight win against OSU, increasing its all time head-to-head record to a lopsided 57-9. 
The matchup with the Ducks was a different story. 
The Trojans overcame 10 errors to win the first set, but the rest of the night saw similar sloppy play from USC and little of the same luck. The Trojans were never able to pull away with a lead and ultimately dropped two close sets 27-25 and 18-16 in the second and fifth sets, respectively.
The score was tied 47 times during the match.
The Trojans were not able to execute as a team. Two starters — senior outside hitter Khalia Lanier and freshman outside hitter Kalen Owes — had a combined 23 errors and potential kills fell out of bounds throughout the match. It was an uncharacteristically sloppy performance for head coach Brent Crouch’s group.
“Every week, I think the team has grown and made progress — we just didn’t execute very well today,” Crouch said. “We had a few players just have some really tough nights, and two or three of them had a really rough night and that’s too many. You can’t have that many people not playing well.”
With players returning from injury and others continuing to fall, Crouch has had to significantly change his lineups recently. This has been a theme all year, contributing to the group’s struggles.
“You know, we’ve had a lot of injuries this year, so we keep putting on new lineups, so we’re looking for some consistency,” Crouch said. “We haven’t had a lot of it.”
Lanier picked up her eighth double-double of the season in the loss to the Ducks, and Weske tallied 11 kills without an error in one of her best performances of the season.
Both matches this weekend went to five sets, the latter being the 10th time USC has gone the distance this season. This sets the record for the most five-set matches in one season in Trojan history. 
“It’s just tiring and it’s exhausting,” Crouch said. “I don’t think it affects anything with confidence. The biggest thing is just that you play more volleyball, so it adds up.”
The Trojans have only two more games left in the regular season — Wednesday at Arizona State and Friday’s senior night clash at home against UCLA. Wednesday’s bout starts at 4 p.m., and Friday’s begins at 7 p.m.

No. 1 USC men’s water polo took third place at the MPSF Tournament in Berkeley this past weekend following a 12-9 semifinal loss to No. 4 Cal and a 10-6 win over No. 3 UCLA. 
The Trojans’ tournament finish and 14-5 overall record earned the program its 15th consecutive trip to the NCAA Tournament. 
USC was the top-seeded team entering the MPSF Tournament after defeating four straight challenging opponents in Stanford, San José State, UCLA and Cal. But the Trojans’ struggles in their narrow win against the Golden Bears would prove to be a harbinger for this weekend’s rematch.
Although Cal ended with a 3-goal lead over USC, the match came down to the final frame. The score was tied eight times over the course of the game, and the teams were tied at 9 with just over three minutes remaining.
That’s when everything fell apart for the Trojans. Cal scored 3 goals in rapid succession as USC misfired on all four of its shots, quickly turning a tight game into a Bears victory.
“I just think we had an off day,” redshirt senior 2-meter Sam Slobodien said. “We get a lot of bar-outs, and we didn’t take the best shots we could have taken.”
After its loss to Cal, USC needed a victory over UCLA in the third-place match to bolster its chances of securing one of the two at-large berths in the NCAA Tournament. The Bruins entered the game with a chip on their shoulder after the Trojans handed them a 10-7 loss in their own pool two weeks prior. 
The Trojans’ most consistent performers played well Sunday. Sophomore driver Hannes Daube put up a hat trick, while senior driver Marin Dasic, sophomore 2-meter Jake Ehrhardt and junior driver Jacob Mercep each added multiple goals to the Trojan cause.
Unlike Saturday’s back-and-forth match against Cal, Sunday’s game was a dominant effort from the second period on. The Trojans took a 6-3 lead at the half, and from there, never led by fewer than 2 goals.
Head coach Marko Pintaric said that although the Trojans held a commanding lead for the majority of the game, it still felt like the score was close.
“Believe me, when you’re in the water or you’re coaching this game, it’s closer than it looks,” Pintaric said. “When you play an opponent like that, it’s a game of inches. It can all be decided in one or two bad decisions.”
Although Slobodien didn’t find the back of the net against UCLA after putting up a pair of scores against Cal, he said he was proud to see his teammates produce offensively.
“I don’t really count my goals,” Slobodien said. “I’m more worried about our team, and it was nice to get the UCLA win the next day [after Cal]. Every day, someone new steps up and contributes. And [it’s] just a matter of who, not if it’s me or if it’s one of our top scorers.”
Last year, USC fell in both games of the MPSF Tournament to the same opponents — Cal and UCLA — yet went on to win the National Championship. Despite their poor performance at the end of the Cal game, the Trojans hope they can achieve the same feat this season.
With the win over UCLA, the Trojans knocked the Bruins out of championship contention. Cal also failed to advance on the road to the NCAA title, so the Bears are one fewer obstacle the Trojans must face in the upcoming Tournament.
The Trojans will look to defend their national title up in Stockton, kicking off the NCAA tournament Dec. 5 against the winner of an opening round game between Harvard and Bucknell. A successful debut match would pit USC against Stanford in a rematch of last season’s title game.

When most people think of Thanksgiving, they think of the basics: food, family, friends, gratitude, Black Friday and cranberry sauce (whatever the hell that is). But for me, as well as an entire nation of maladjusted sports fans, there is another pillar of Thanksgiving tradition that takes precedent over all others: football. 
For those who don’t know, Thanksgiving marks the greatest weekend of the football season. It’s a four-day celebration of all that is good and holy about the sport, opening Thursday and closing Sunday with the NFL and filling in the gaps with some of the best rivalries in college football.
It starts on Thanksgiving Day with a full slate of NFL games bound to keep you couch-locked while your mom and her siblings tire away in the kitchen. There’s always three — an early afternoon game, an afternoon game and a night game. The Detroit Lions usually lose one of them, and the Dallas Cowboys typically emerge victorious in another. It’s a tradition football fans have grown accustomed to at this point, but that doesn’t make it any less special when Thanksgiving rolls around each year.
The next day, after the food has settled and the hangover has kicked in, we begin the first of a two-day college football festival otherwise known as Rivalry Weekend. Some people call it the greatest weekend in sports; I’m sure others have grown tired of my hyperbole at this point. Either way, it’s certainly a weekend worth celebrating, with a seemingly endless stream of top-flight rivalry games for two whole days. There are always a few games on the docket you can’t miss while you’re busy cleaning out your fridge and freezer.
At noon Saturday, No. 2 Ohio State and No. 10 Michigan face off in what is known in the American sports canon as “The Game.” That’s right, not “The Game Up North” or even “The Big Game,” just “The Game” — as in The Only Game you should ever be concerned about. Ohio State and Michigan have been facing off for more than a century now (this Saturday will mark the 116th game between the two programs), and the rivalry is still as fresh as it’s ever been.
Sure, Ohio State has won seven straight dating back to Urban Meyer’s reign of terror, but Michigan probably has its best chance to play spoiler in years. It’s Ryan Day’s first game against Michigan as head coach of the Buckeyes, and a win would all but guarantee his team’s slot in the elusive College Football Playoff. As a two-loss team, it’s a long shot for Michigan to make the playoff, but a win against their highly ranked rivals would make a convincing argument to any skeptic on the playoff committee.
Finally, if you’re from a certain part of the country where one’s identity is irreversibly tied to the college football team one pledges their allegiance to (the Dirty South, baby), there is one rivalry that trumps all others in terms of passion, commitment and disdain for the other side: the Iron Bowl. Alabama’s in-state rivalry between the Alabama Crimson Tide and Auburn Tigers is among the sport’s most beloved (or infamous, depending on how you look at it), and this year, everything is on the line. 
Just two weeks removed from a heartbreaking home loss against top-ranked LSU, the No. 5 Crimson Tide will travel two and a half hours south to face its sworn enemy without its on-field leader, junior quarterback Tua Tagovailoa. It’s a win-or-go-home game for an Alabama team teetering on the edge of a playoff berth, and I can’t think of a better opponent to stand in their way than the dreaded Auburn Tigers.
To cap this delicious meal, right before us USC students are slated for our final week of classes, we’re blessed with a classic NFL Sunday. Look, I recognize that it’s already a weekly tradition in the fall, but a full Thanksgiving schedule doesn’t make it any less exciting. Two of the season’s best games fall on this Sunday, with a matchup between the conference-leading San Francisco 49ers and the Baltimore Ravens and a Sunday night clash between the New England Patriots and the Houston Texans.
It sounds like a lot of football because it is and that’s the point. If the football season is an indie movie (which, for some of us, isn’t a stretch), this weekend is the emotional climax where the protagonist dunks her head underwater and comes of age — or something. Either way, I already forgot what we’re getting three days off of school for. Sports!

23andMe, an at-home genetic testing service, was founded just 13 years ago. At the time, the idea of spitting into a tube, sending it off to a lab and receiving an in-depth analysis of the corresponding DNA sequence — all for a little over $100 — was unthinkable. However, researchers at USC are pioneering a wide variety of clinical tests that are more accessible and affordable.
Viterbi School of Engineering assistant professor Maral Mousavi is currently researching affordable at-home tests with unconventional materials such as yarn and paper.
Her project, which she has been working on since completing her postdoctorate at Harvard University a few years ago, has been dubbed “MAD Lab,” or the Laboratory for Design of Medical and Analytical Devices.  
 “In a way, it’s something that is accessible to all,” Mousavi said. “You don’t have to pay hundreds of dollars to get a sheet of paper.”
 Mousavi said expensive clinical tests can pose significant financial barriers to individuals who are unable to afford the medical care they need. One of the advantages of using simple materials is that they are “microfluidic devices,” capable of easily transferring solutions. 
One of Mousavi’s doctoral students, Victor Ong, said using paper and yarn to deliver accurate medical tests could be cost effective and make medical assistance more accessible for individuals across socioeconomic statuses. Ong also said it is more affordable for the developer.
“You don’t have to spend a lot of money or time to develop tiny silicone channels that might be 10, 15 microns in width,” Ong said. “You can just take a piece of thread, which is already there and sort of use that to transport your liquid instead.”
Mousavi said that in recent years, the cost of healthcare and medical expenses are at all-time highs and that her lab is working toward cutting down on the overall cost and time that healthcare requires. 
“We don’t need a lot of complicated pipetting,” she said. “We want to eliminate these expensive clinical analyzers that would cost 50k and above.” 
Her ultimate goal for this research is a simple system that could be made inexpensively and “hopefully [be] coupled with your smartphone.”
Mousavi and her team of USC researchers are also working on a device that individuals with chronic kidney disease could use. With inexpensive technology that could detect electrolytes in blood obtained from a finger prick, she said patients could monitor their diseases more frequently at a lower cost from the comfort of their home. She hopes patients can monitor the efficacy of the medication they are taking.
Mousavi is also passionate about opening research positions to undergraduate students interested in pioneering devices in the medical field. Lydia Cardwell, a freshman majoring in biomedical engineering, said her interest in Mousavi’s work stems from a passion for accessibility and equality within technology fields. 
“I believe we have so many problems with the health care system in the U.S., and at a certain point, we’ve kind of been trying to solve this problem just by having more doctors, having more of the same kind of strategy,” Cardwell said. “As an engineer, we can uniquely provide solutions for the problems in our health care system.”
Although the lab is still in its early planning and developing stages, Mousavi hopes to push for accessibility within her field of research and invites students to work on projects with MAD Lab. 
“She is a young professor, she’s new, but she asks you how your weekends go, she cares about what the undergrads think,” Ong said. “She takes our opinions into account and we talk through things. That’s been a huge blessing to me.”

When he was studying public administration at USC, Richard Ceballos landed an internship at the child abuse and sex crimes unit of the district attorney’s office. 
Ceballos worked at the DA’s office during the McMartin preschool trial in the 1980s, when the owners of a family-run day care in Manhattan Beach were charged with 321 counts of child abuse against 41 children. During his internship, he would listen in on the discussions between prosecutors in the office on how to handle the investigation. Finding the best ways to help the children intrigued Ceballos. 
He knew from that point forward that he wanted to go to law school and become a prosecutor.  
“You want to give victims a voice because victims don’t choose to become victims,” he said. “And when they do become victims, often times, they feel they don’t have a voice, so prosecutors become a voice in court and try to seek justice for what happened to them.” 
After graduating from USC in 1985, Ceballos obtained his law degree at Loyola Marymount University and began his career as a prosecutor. 
Now, Ceballos serves as a deputy district attorney in Los Angeles and has worked in the L.A. District Attorney’s office for almost 30 years. But he sees a need for more change in how the city handles crime. In March, he announced that he would run against his current boss Dist. Att. Jackie Lacey in the 2020 race. 
Lacey has served in her position since December 2012, and Ceballos said his boss is too traditional in her persecution of city crimes. Ceballos centered his campaign on a “smart on crime” mentality focused on helping people through criminal justice reform rather than making it a goal to fill prisons with more and more people. 
He said he hopes to eliminate the cash bail system and create more accountability and transparency within the criminal justice reform system, among other changes. 
Ceballos wants prosecutors to work with community members who have committed crimes and help them receive the resources they need to improve. Otherwise, he said, when they’re released from prison, they’ll just return to committing the same crimes and repeating the cycle. 
“You have some people that, frankly, they love being a prosecutor because they love throwing people in jail and prison — that has to change,” he said. “It has to be your job as prosecutors not to send people to jail or prison [but] to do justice.” 
Ceballos said he’s tried to raise his concerns with Lacey multiple times but has never been successful.
In a statement to the Daily Trojan, Lacey wrote about her efforts to establish a Mental Health Division to help criminals with mental health issues be directed to services rather than through the legal system. Lacey also pointed to her efforts to support a ban on private prisons, work to reform the cash bail system and erase hundreds of thousands of minor court citations, like sleeping on public property, to help people living in homelessness find housing and services, among other efforts. 
“Throughout my tenure as L.A. County’s District Attorney, I’ve been committed to the two goals of protecting our community and promoting smart, innovative policies to reform our criminal justice system and ensure fairness and justice for all,” she wrote. “I take both of these responsibilities very seriously.”
Besides Lacey, Ceballos will also compete against George Gascon, a former San Francisco district attorney who recently resigned and moved to L.A. He also served as a San Francisco police chief and L.A. police officer. But Ceballos believes his 30 years of experience in the L.A. office will help him create lasting change. 
Luis Rodriguez, who has known and worked with Ceballos for nearly 20 years, said he has always had positive interactions with Ceballos, both personally and professionally.
“I’ve always found him to be a very open minded and respectful individual and someone who … is an ethical individual who, if it’s a criminal case that he’s on, he’s not the kind of person who I would worry about his veracity or his ethical stance,” Rodriguez said. 
Ceballos returned to USC in 2017 to teach a class on ethics at the Gould School of Law and also previously taught ethics and advanced criminal procedures at the UC Irvine School of Law since 2010. 
Eunsuk Yang, a third-year Gould student, took Ceballos’ class in Spring 2018 and interned under him at the district attorney’s office the following school year. Yang enjoyed the class because he said Ceballos also brought in people from different aspects of law like criminal defense or public interest attorneys as guest speakers to provide new perspectives. 
“He kept emphasizing that at the end of the day, your reputation carries over wherever you go with you, and that’s based on ethics … and that should be your moral compass,” he said. 
Ceballos also used his experiences working as a prosecutor to teach his students. One lesson that stood out to Yang revolved around a 2006 Supreme Court case Ceballos had fought against his boss, then-Dist. Att. Gil Garcetti. 
Ceballos notified his office after finding facts in a search warrant affidavit were misrepresented or false. While attorneys prosecuting the case agreed with Ceballos that some of the information was false, the D.A.’s office refused to dismiss the case, and Ceballos was subpoenaed to testify for the defense. 
He said some workers in his office retaliated against him for helping the defense and he sued, arguing that the First Amendment protected him. Ceballos ultimately lost in a 5-4 decision at the high court. Still, Ceballos said he uses the case to teach students to look harder at the evidence and cases they are assigned to and to question the information they’re reading for inaccuracies. 
“Just because it’s in writing doesn’t mean it’s truthful, doesn’t mean it’s accurate,” he said. “As lawyers, you have to dig beyond that, and when you find something that’s misrepresented in the warrant, then your duty [is] to investigate that and question them.”

When Undergraduate Student Government Director of Sustainability Affairs Isabella Caltabiano took office this semester, one of her goals was to keep the Greek community aligned with the rest of the University in terms of progress toward achieving campus-wide sustainability. 
This semester, she began talks with Greek organizations and, with help from Environmental Student Assembly ambassador Julia Orozco and USG Assistant Director of Sustainability Laura Pearson, launched two initiatives to reduce waste within USC’s 25 fraternity and sorority chapters.
To get recycling bins into the fraternity houses, Caltabiano said she first reached out to fraternities individually and spoke with the respective fraternity member in charge of each organization’s budget. She and her team members have been visiting each fraternity to present recycling guidelines and distribute flyers.
“Only 9% of things … put in the recycling bin actually end up recycled, so it’s really important that everyone knows what to recycle so we can ensure that the most [waste items] can get recycled,” Orozco said.
The Sigma Chi fraternity was the first to implement recycling in its house, using $100 from its budget to purchase five bins from Home Depot. When the bins arrived at the house earlier this month, the fraternity placed them in the residential and dining areas and provided flyers to students clarifying what items can be recycled.
“We’ve been doing internally some sustainability stuff through Sigma Chi … trying to minimize our waste,” Sigma Chi housing manager David Kim said. “So when [Caltabiano] told me about this whole recycling initiative, [I said,] ‘Yeah, let’s do it.’”
Kim ordered the bins online, and within two days, they were delivered at the house and ready for use. Caltabiano said when she visited the house the day of the bins’ delivery, they had already begun to fill up.
“While this is supposed to be a whole-Row initiative — which it is going to be — it was really great that we had such a successful first house because it really takes that momentum to do so,” Caltabiano said.
Implementing the compost program has been more challenging, Caltabiano said. While LA Sanitation & Environment already provides certain recycling services at no additional charge, the organizations will have to cover the cost of compost collection. Caltabiano said installing compost bins and paying for the compost service would result in an increase in sorority dues of about $6 per member. Because many students are unfamiliar with the procedure for composting, she said there will be more outreach and educational sessions for sorority members.
“While we taught the guys how to recycle, most people really do know how to recycle,” Caltabiano said. “There are just more questions when it comes to composting, so there needs to be staff training. The staff [has] to sort of be watching and making sure that the compost is going to the compost.”
To implement composting in a sorority, the sorority chapter’s house corporation has to greenlight the measure and present it to Republic Services, which manages waste and waste diversion at USC, to draw up a contract. 
So far, Tri Delta has approved the compost proposal and plans to install the bins by Spring 2020, and Gamma Phi Beta will deliberate about the initiative at its next house corporation meeting. 
Orozco said composting is particularly impactful for sororities because they can easily do so with the three in-house meals served each day, as well as waste from the Friday brunches that are open to the sisters’ families and invitees. 
“Instead of scraping the food [waste] into the trash, they would put the compostable food in the compost and then the food that can’t get composted into the trash,” Orozco said. “It’s something super easy that’ll take a few more seconds, and the girls seem pretty happy about that too because sustainability is important, especially in today’s climate change crisis.”
Caltabiano said the initiatives would integrate sustainable practices into the Greek community’s daily routines, making waste diversion easier and lessening the Row’s environmental footprint.
“There are a lot of good people in Greek life and, I think, people that are really excited to make this positive impact,” Caltabiano said. “No one really wants to be throwing away their food, no one wants to not be recycling — it is just sort of an afterthought.”

With tens of thousands of students, staff and faculty on 226 acres at the center of an urban hub, one of University Park Campus’ most contentious elements is space — spaces to learn, to study, to relax and to build community. From Doheny Library to Ground Zero Cafe, USC currently has some exceptional buildings to meet some of these needs. 
As student enrollment increases year by year and as our population becomes more diverse, there’s an ever-evolving and increasing need for more spaces to access resources, build community and study. Multiple members of the Undergraduate Student Government are working on space initiatives — three of these include transitional housing, a first-generation resource center and places to study — to address this need.
Transitional Housing
Research shows that dealing with food and housing insecurity adversely affects students’ psychological health and academic performance. Consequently, for many years, various departments have sought to support students who are struggling to meet their basic needs, particularly with food insecurity. 
In 2018, a collaborative effort by USG, Graduate Student Government, Hospitality and Student Affairs led to the creation of the Trojan Food Pantry, a centralized resource for students struggling to buy food. Since then, other students have sought to address homelessness, creating the student organization Trojan Shelter. 
Opening its doors in Koreatown to six students earlier this month, the group led an impressive volunteer and fundraising campaign to create a new space that “[promote] solutions that advance the alleviation of homelessness in Los Angeles.” 
A 2015 study at the University of Massachusetts Boston reported that 5.4% of U.S. college students experienced homelessness and 45% of participants reported housing insecurity. Additionally, 5% of University of California students, 10% of Cal State students and 20% of community college students have experienced homelessness. As homelessness rates and the cost of living in L.A. rise, and USC’s cost of attendance similarly increases, there’s no doubt that USC, a microcosm of the city, is also affected by student homelessness and housing insecurity. 
While the Trojan Shelter in Koreatown is admirable and an incredible step in the right direction, there still exists a need for more beds at a location closer to UPC. There’s no identifiable, distinct data on USC student homelessness, but it’s safe to say that we’re not immune to this issue. 
That said, to address this, the first step ahead of us is to gather USC-specific data, which USG is working on with multiple campus partners. The second is creating a transitional housing and basic needs center near UPC to better support students in need.
After all, the central mission of USC is the “cultivation and enrichment of the human mind and spirit.” Access to basic needs is a clear obstacle for some students at USC to fully meet this mission. In moving forward, a clear priority for our community must be to understand the extent of this obstacle, further support initiatives like transitional housing spaces near UPC and to eliminate these barriers that adversely affect the academic and life-long success of students. 
First-Generation Resource Center
Fifteen percent of USC’s Class of 2023 are first-generation students. Overall, 25%, or around 5,000, of all USC undergraduates are first-generation college students. As USC strives to increasingly admit students of diverse backgrounds, there is a similarly increasing need for resources that support the transition to an often-unfamiliar, rigorous academic environment. 
For a number of years, many students have advocated for the creation of a first-generation student resource center similar to other resource centers currently on campus. This year, USG Senators Emily Donahue, Emily Johnson and Omar Garcia have worked with various on-campus organizations to create a proposal for the resource center, which would aim to establish a centralized, physical space for students to access resources, gain mentorship and build community. 
Additionally, it would provide programming to connect students, find community and focus on well-being. Though USC departments such as the Career Center, Financial Aid and the Dornsife school have made efforts to bridge the gap for the first-generation student community, it’s crucial for students to have an availabile centralized, physical space to find reliable mentors and advocates to support their needs.
Study Spaces
With final exams just around the corner, it’s important to discuss the lack of study spaces available on campus, particularly late-night options. 
Café 84 at King Hall is one option for late-night studying. However, the only 24-hour library space is Leavey. Many libraries on campus close by 10 p.m. on weekdays, and some close by 5 p.m. or even all day on weekends. With tens of thousands of students studying at UPC, Leavey quickly fills up, especially during academically demanding periods of the semester. 
Most students, ourselves included, can attest to not being able to find a desk at Leavey or knowing it will be full and avoiding it altogether. Then, we go searching for a spot, building to building, just to be asked to leave when the location closes early in the night.
Given this, students are often looking for quiet spaces to study on campus. During finals, many academic departments, such as the Marshall and Dornsife schools expand their hours of operation to support the students that require space to study. 
However, extending the hours of operation of some UPC libraries — locations specifically built for studying — would be the ideal solution, as it would provide large, quiet spaces for students to study. In the meantime, USG has partnered with USC Hospitality to provide an interim solution, which will be publicized soon.
Reallocating or creating space to meet students’ basic needs — whether it be for access to food and housing or as simple as community building and places to study — must be a priority for the USC community. As we end 2019 and look toward a new year, these three initiatives, among many others, will be at the center of our discussions and proposals.

To many USC students, it’s a familiar image.
Friday night on the Row. EDM spills onto the street. Girls crowd the sidewalk outside some fraternity house. Inside, fraternity boys patrol the waters; under the strobing lights, they cut paths like blonde, blue-eyed sharks. Apparently, this is how one unwinds after a long week of philanthropy and academic excellence.
According to USC’s Interfraternity Council website, “The fraternity and sorority community at USC exemplifies what Greek organizations should be.” Oh, the irony.
Although many of USC’s fraternities and sororities have every right to be proud of their successes — both on the individual and collective level — it’s impossible to overlook the general atmosphere of homogeneity that hangs cloudlike over the University’s Greek system. 
Put simply, USC’s Greek system is like a mullet — business in the front, party in the back and Caucasian all over. 
The University’s Greek life is composed of more than 50 recognized chapters grouped into five classifications: the National Pan-Hellenic Council, Interfraternity Council, Asian Greek Council, Multicultural Greek Council and the Panhellenic Council. Of those, three councils have a focus on underrepresented communities: NPHC, AGC and MGC. However, IFC and PHC oversee far more chapters and currently dominate the 28th Street real estate. 
And if this year’s promotional videos are representative of the organizations, the chapters of IFC and PHC are also predominantly white. A walk down the Row confirms as much. Of all the houses, there’s not one cultural fraternity or sorority to be seen. 
Such a monopoly of space is unsurprising given the inherently elitist nature of Greek life. To be a member of one of USC’s PHC sororities, semester fees range from $1,858 to $5,899. For the IFC, summarized fees aren’t provided, but Tau Kappa Epsilon reports its semester fees as between $2,600 and $7,200. 
Although both the PHC and IFC offer partial scholarships — for amounts between $500 and $1,000 — the steep expenses immediately deprive students from more diverse socioeconomic backgrounds of the opportunities promised by these Greek organizations. 
Given greater membership and high fees, it’s clear that IFC and PHC chapters are receiving more funding. It’s used for grounds upkeep, formal events, group trips and weekly parties — with such an apparent abundance of time and money, why can’t a portion be invested into the recruitment of economically and ethnically diverse members?
This isn’t a revolutionary idea. And one must not underestimate the intelligence of IFC and PHC members — after all, they’re still ranked No. 22 university by U.S. News and World Report. 
The fraternities and sororities of IFC and PHC must take initiative to diversify their memberships. As it stands, the lack of ethnic diversity exacerbates the general preconception of white privilege and elitism attached to Greek organizations and USC in general.
The Row is the public face of the University’s Greek life — what message does such a pale complexion give, if not exclusion?

There are a very few number of people in recent memory who have had as profound an impact on others as the late Fred Rogers did. His half-hour educational children’s series “Mister Rogers’ Neighborhood” debuted in 1968 and ran until late 2001, just a couple years before his death. 
Unlike any show before or after, its storied existence genuinely helped generations of children deal with their encounters with dark real-world problems such as death, divorce, discrimination and anger. Marielle Heller’s drama biopic “A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood” takes an in-depth look at this figure’s powerful influence on humanity, faithfully honoring him whille avoiding the feeling of a puff piece. 
Heller’s film follows the real-life inspired story of Esquire journalist Lloyd Vogel (Matthew Rhys) who is assigned to write a profile on Rogers (Tom Hanks) for a series on the country’s most important real-life heroes. Used to writing cynical exposés rather than flattering puff pieces, Lloyd finds it inherently impossible to believe Mr. Rogers’ optimistic character and effect on others. This internal struggle within Lloyd sets up the driving narrative of the film. How can someone so good as Mr. Rogers actually exist? 
Oddly enough, the most fascinating thing about the film is that it is not really about Fred Rogers. While the story is more centered on this jaded journalist’s profile on the man, the film never becomes a biopic on Mr. Rogers. Instead of focusing on the man himself with his values and flaws, “A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood” shows what’s really more important — the power of Rogers’ impact on everyone he encountered. 
This can be seen through his impact on the emotionally complex lead character. Dealing with new fatherhood and deep-rooted issues with his own father, Lloyd serves as a conduit for the audience to have their own two-hour-long therapy session with Mr. Rogers. In fact, Heller artistically directs the entire film as if it is an installment of the children’s series, framing it within a meta-episode taught by Mr. Rogers himself.
While not the protagonist of the narrative, Tom Hanks’ portrayal of Fred Rogers lends the film its emotional resonance. He perfectly re-creates the kindred spirit of the great man without directly imitating him. The best parts of the film are the emotional moments where it’s as if Hanks’ Rogers is directly speaking to the audience, helping each person through their own issues. On the other hand, Rhys gives a more subtle performance of a broken, damaged man that fittingly serves the part. 
In its technical aspects, “A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood” is a modest achievement. The film recreates old television footage of Mr. Rogers with Hanks to wonderful effect. The way the film incorporates the old show within its transitions and framing is marvelous. While never flashy, the editing and cinematography are done quite well, especially during some key moments in the film. Technical details really shine when the film cinematically infuses the miniature sets of “Mister Rogers’ Neighborhood” within its own visual texture. 
The film’s screenplay is also strong. However, Lloyd’s actions sometimes feel a bit rushed. Throughout the film, the character occasionally makes slightly odd choices without enough dialogue setup, particularly in the tidy resolution of his arc near the climax of the film. Yet, Heller’s artistic direction turns this predictable progression into a marvelous climactic segment.
“A Beautiful Day in the  Neighborhood” ultimately serves as a great therapeutic device for anyone struggling through something in life — and who isn’t? Everyone’s human, even Mr. Rogers, and being human is hard. This film reminds people how important and special it is to be kind to others and vulnerable to ourselves.

When Amir Kelly first heard Beyoncé’s “Baby Boy,” it resonated with him. The track was the first time he’d heard traditional R&B and Indian musical stylings in a song representative of his Black and Indian identity. 
“I couldn’t put my finger on it at the time, but now that I look back on it, it was the first song that I heard that literally captured both sides of my sound,” said Kelly, a senior majoring in popular music and music industry. For Kelly, the R&B track featured Indian melodic influences, reflecting both his Black and Indian racial identity. 
Now, more than 16 years after its release, the sound Beyoncé and Scott Storch created isn’t an anomaly to Kelly but definitive of the music he’s creating. His latest single, “Eden,” which was released mid-November, is a pop and R&B track with “Indian classical influences sprinkled throughout,” including the use of the tabla, a percussion instrument, in the song’s intro.
Born to an Indian American mother and Black American father, Kelly hasn’t always successfully reckoned with his Indian heritage and Blackness as he does in his music. 
“It was really hard for me to claim my Indian side because Indians are really anti-Black,” Kelly said. 
In fact, his Indian family initially disowned his mother because of her relationship with his father, a rift that reflected the way Kelly first experienced his identity. 
“I was never Indian enough; I never had ownership of it,” Kelly said. “But I was at all the temples and I learned all the songs and I spoke the language and I ate the food and I was there for my whole life.”
Over the past seven months, Kelly’s been on a quest to “[reclaim his] culture purposefully every day” through weekly visits and Hindu lessons with his grandfather, who immigrated to Los Angeles from India in the late 1960s. Kelly said the time spent with his grandpa, along with therapy and a year-long break from releasing new material, produced “Eden” and a slew of singles to come that focused on taking ownership of what’s his. 
Members of Kelly’s creative team also played a part in crafting the theme central to his sound. 
Outside of his own knowledge and study of Black and Indian music, he’s called upon peers from USC to inform his artistry. Classically trained Indian singer and 2019 Thornton School of Music graduate Shilpa Sadagopan co-wrote his debut single “MAUI,” tapping into her classical Carnatic background, which Kelly said “influenced the verses’ melodies.”
“Eden” co-writer, USC alumna and friend Ashley Brooks, who Kelly calls “the love child between Timbaland and Brandy,” is responsible for tackling the R&B side of his music. 
“It’s been beautiful to watch and I feel so humbled and grateful,” Brooks said of Kelly’s artistic reclamation. “Not only has he learned an experience, but he’s also brought his team along with him.”
Brooks also got to sit down with Kelly’s grandfather in an experience she called “enlightening.” 
Melodically, “Eden” allows Kelly to reclaim his racial identity, but the meaning and origin of the song are of a completely different leaf. The artist takes his listeners to the birthplace of sin. 
“I want the song to be about my virginity,” Kelly told Brooks during the song’s genesis. At the time, he was still a virgin but was ready to shed the descriptor. 
“We like to capture an experience,” Kelly said. And that’s exactly what the two did on “Eden.” Through lyrics like “If I share my secrets with you / Will you stay all night? / If I let you in my garden will you take a bite?” listeners become part of Kelly’s premier sexual encounter.
A year later, the track is no longer his pleading desire to lose his virginity but addresses male sexuality and sexual ownership in a new light. 
“I feel like just as a man, people don’t really think about male virginity at all,” Kelly said. 
To him, “Eden” is a reminder to be “very empowered sexually but still feel like [he has] ownership over [his] own quote-unquote garden.” 
Despite receiving a nod from music publication Earmilk, “MAUI” was just a test run. 
“Back then, I just wanted to prove to myself that I could do it,” Kelly said. 
The track was Kelly “trying to create something that everyone else liked.” Between the release of the two singles, Kelly noticed a shift in not only his messaging but also how he worked with his creative team. 
“It’s a lot harder to be vulnerable,” he said on his relationship with fellow creatives. “The more I open up to them, the more that they are able to support me and my vision.” 
And now he’s no longer making music for likability but for authenticity. 
“Who am I? and What am I tryna say?” are the questions he’s asking and answering through his upcoming EP and the video for “Eden.”
Kelly and his team hosted an immersive experience Nov. 22 ahead of the video’s release where they created the visual world of “Eden.” 
“I really love this idea of creating different worlds and all my songs are a little fantastical in that sense,” the artist said. “I don’t want my listeners to listen to my music without imagining the video.”
In conversations with Kelly, his photographer and creative director Caleb Griffin discussed using creative direction as a tool to “amp it up” when it comes to driving home his music’s dual cultural elements.
“We’re both much more mature in how we think about things and how we execute things,” said Griffin, a senior majoring in art, of his collaboration with Kelly.
As for Kelly’s close family who shares his “Blindian” identity — they already get it. 
“They get it the most because they lived it with me,” he said. “They feel that it represents themselves in the fullest light.”
And mainstream outlets are starting to get it, too. 
PopSugar named Kelly as one of 17 “up-and-coming music artists” last month along with fellow Thornton student Ayoni Thompson. And the video for “Eden” premiered in Rolling Stone India. 
But the biggest challenge for Kelly might not be racking up streaming numbers or nods from music’s most impactful publications — it’ll likely be gaining the trust of his Indian family. 
“It’s hard to see their fears and their experience that they projected on my mom personified into marketable art,” he said of his family’s relationship with his music and racial identity. 
With “Eden” and “MAUI” under his belt and a continued effort to put his Blackness in conversation with his Indian heritage, Kelly is doing more than standing out amid new R&B acts. As he puts it, he’s “reclaiming things that were taken from me.”
