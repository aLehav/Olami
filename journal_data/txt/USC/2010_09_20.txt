You’d never know it, but USC is three games into its football season.
So that explains the guys in white and cardinal playing on ESPN Saturday against Minnesota. And those same guys jubilantly singing “Fight On” afterward — I guess those must have been Trojans.
Still, three games into the season, I can’t help but wonder, “Who are these guys?”
After three weeks showcasing three different teams, the Trojans are still in search of an identity.
In wins against Hawai’i, Virginia and Minnesota, USC has shown different aspects of what could become its trademark qualities this season.
But what will they be?
The hard-nosed rushing attack that sparked USC to 216 yards Saturday? With senior Allen Bradford, redshirt junior Marc Tyler and freshman Dillon Baxter at tailback, there is no reason the Trojans shouldn’t be able to run the ball whenever they feel like it.
Bradford, the most physical of the backs, imposed his will in a breakout performance of 131 yards on 12 carries. But coming into the game, Bradford was the third running back on the depth chart, and USC coach Lane Kiffin said afterward that no decision had been made about changing the starter.
Not that there should be after just one game. But since Kiffin’s Trojans are wisely unwilling to employ a tailback-by-committee offense like Pete Carroll did, the decision as to which running back starts will go a long way in determining the flavor of the USC offense.
Tyler, who has started every game this season, looked fantastic against Hawai’i, but then sputtered out the following games. He is more versatile than Bradford but less physical. If the Trojans want to be a pound-the-ball team, No. 21 should be the first guy getting carries.
Baxter has gotten his chances here and there, but after only seven carries for 24 yards last week, it is unlikely he will come to define this offense.
Will the Trojans be the pass-happy, explosive offense we saw against Hawai’i, then? Maybe, considering the Trojans showed flashes of brilliance Saturday, such as when sophomore quarterback Matt Barkley hit senior wide receiver Ronald Johnson on a perfectly timed 53-yard touchdown.
The passing game still looked inconsistent, however, with no reliable third receiver emerging for Barkley to count on. Freshman wide receiver Robert Woods has shown potential, as has redshirt junior tight end Rhett Ellison.
The defense is perhaps the Trojans’ greatest enigma.
After an awful outing in the season opener where the Warriors exposed more holes than a graveyard, the back line has been impressive in the last two games, especially in shutting down Minnesota’s rushing attack. The Trojans held the Gophers to just 83 total rushing yards, with only six of those coming from major threat tailback Duane Bennett.
And what’s up with these wacky special teams?
Woods officially established himself as a special teams threat after his 97-yard kickoff return. But that, along with Johnson’s punt return for a touchdown against Hawai’i, has been the only bright spot for the special teams unit.
The Trojans failed on three two-point conversion attempts Saturday, making this the second game where Kiffin unnecessarily decided against the conventional extra point. Senior kicker Joe Houston hasn’t missed an extra point all season, but is only 1-3 on field goal attempts.
Going for two injects a team with a brazenness and confidence — when the conversion attempts are successful. When they are not, they take a little bit of momentum away from a touchdown and probably more than anything, annoy the other team.
Whatever message Kiffin is trying to send to his team with these conversions isn’t working.
With so many uncertainties abounding in every aspect of the game for the Trojans, “Who are these guys?” is still a legitimate question. Kiffin recognized last week that developing an identity is a long process, especially with a new coaching staff and a new mentality.
Luckily for the Trojans, the weakest part of their schedule has come at these early stages, when they can afford to be inconsistent and still manage to win games.
Whatever the Trojans end up identifying as — a power running team, a bend-but-don’t-break defense, etc. — will define this season. If they remain an unrecognizable team from one week to the next, they will fade in the latter half of the schedule.
Maybe this week, the Trojans will finally put all the pieces together.
Scratch that. The Trojans visit Washington State for the annual scrimmage against a high school team masquerading as an Football Bowl Subdivision program.
Maybe, then, the week after.

The No. 7 USC women’s volleyball team (10-0) looks to complete a perfect nonconference season tonight as it heads to Irvine, Calif., to face off against UC Irvine at 7 p.m.
Unbreakable · Junior setter Kendall Bateman and freshman middle blocker Alexis Olgard have been key to the Women of Troy’s success. - Tim Tran | Daily Trojan 
Despite having just completed the Fresno State Invitational last weekend — where the Women of Troy swept Fresno State, Cal State Bakersfield and Sacramento State — USC coach Mick Haley does not seem worried about his team playing on such short rest. Part of this confidence stems from the fact that many of his players were rotated into this weekend’s matches, and his team is not suffering from many injuries.
“We need to go win down at Irvine on Tuesday night, and then we’ll open the conference Friday night at Galen Center with the Bruins,” Haley said. “I think we’ve got time to get ready for all of that.”
Prior to this weekend’s games, Haley was asked how he felt about his team having to play four games in just five days. Although he did express some concern, he justified the hectic schedule, saying he recognized how deep his team is and wanted to challenge his players while also giving more of them the opportunity to get into some games.
Freshman outside hitter Falyn Fonoimoana said she did not believe the team would be fatigued when it came time to face the Anteaters Tuesday.
“We’ll be ready for Irvine because we take each opponent as a respectable team and I think we’re gonna be ready to take another step further to get us to conference,” Fonoimoana said.
Throughout the season, Haley has stressed defense as the area the team needs to work on in practice. Although Fonoimoana recognizes this as well, she also said the Women of Troy need to focus on fundamentals in order to prepare for Tuesday’s game.
“I think you can never be too good at the little things right now, and I think that’s a good motto for us right now,” Fonoimoana said.
Fonoimoana is one of the players to watch in Tuesday’s match. The freshman recorded 32 kills over the span of three games last weekend. Saturday night against Sacramento State, she earned her first collegiate double-double with 10 kills and 11 digs.
Other players to keep an eye on include junior setter Kendall Bateman, who had 102 assists in the Fresno State Invitational, including 39 against Sacramento State. Freshman middle blocker Alexis Olgard recorded eight kills of her own that game. Olgard and Fonoimoana are just two of six freshmen currently playing on Haley’s roster.
UC Irvine is coming off a loss Saturday to UCLA at home. The team has also lost to Hawai’i this season, a team USC defeated in one of its first matches of the season. UC Irvine currently sits with a record of 4-7, while the Women of Troy have swept their last four opponents and eight out of 10 so far this season.
Good luck Women of Troy against the Bruins!  You can do it!!!

USC women’s volleyball coach Mick Haley has been leading college teams to victory since the 1970s, but it was not until this season that his coaching career reached a milestone only a few have achieved in collegiate sports — 1,000 women’s volleyball victories.
Wise words · Women’s volleyball coach Mick Haley won his 1,000th volleyball game as a head coach of a women’s team earlier this season with USC. His team remains undefeated this season, having won 10 games and three invitational tournaments already. - Tim Tran | Daily Trojan 
Haley reached the millenium mark at the beginning of this season; however, the coach values the journey more than the milestone itself.
“Tallying 1,000 wins only means that you’ve been doing this for a long time with good players,” he said.
The esteemed women’s volleyball coach began his journey at Kellogg Community College, coaching from 1973 to 1979. With the exception of his rookie season, Haley has never coached a team that finished with a losing record. At Texas, Haley coached the Longhorns to national championships in 1981 and 1988.
One of Haley’s greatest honors came in 1997, when he was given the opportunity to represent his country and coach the U.S. women’s volleyball team in the 2000 Sydney Summer Olympics. Haley’s team finished fourth, losing in the bronze medal match to Brazil.
With Haley at the helm, USC has won two national championships, coming back-to-back in 2002 and 2003, finishing the season with an undefeated record of 35-0 that year. He’s made it his mission to transform good players into great ones by encouraging them to always perform to the best of their ability.
Current players have certainly noticed Haley’s efforts and enthusiasm.
“[Haley] pushes us and expects so much from us,” junior setter Kendall Bateman said.
Junior middle blocker Lauren Williams said it took her a long time to “appreciate [Haley’s] mixed style” of coaching.
“If you’re young, he pushes you,” Williams said. “If you’re old, he challenges you to be better.”
Not one for constantly yelling at young, underperforming players, Haley creates a learning environment by eschewing loud tirades in favor of conveying valuable messages, she said.
“[Haley] takes the time to explain and won’t yell at you if he sees you struggling,” Junior outside hitter Alex Jupiter said.  “[He offers] a different perspective.”
But just because Haley exhibits greater patience than more strident coaches does not mean he has a more relaxed coaching style.
On the contrary, Haley possesses unwavering determination and pure resilience when it comes to motivating his players. He always strives to “max everything and everyone out,” Haley said.
Last summer, Haley took a trip down memory lane and reconnected with some of his former players. When he asked them what stuck out the most about his coaching style, he said his players remembered his signature words of wisdom: “Don’t be average. Be as good as you can be.”
After 1,000 wins, Haley still coaches to that adage. Encouraging individual improvement and team spirit, he has employed a unique mix of techniques and philosophies that make him a teacher as well as a coach.
Haley’s investment in each one of his players has certainly paid dividends on the court, as he’s produced some of the nation’s best players during his tenure, including several on the current squad.
Jupiter, who has broken numerous records already at USC, is only about 40 kills away from her own milestone — 1,000 kills. Williams has the second-highest hitting percentage in the nation, Bateman is third in the country and first in the conference in assists — and the list goes on.
This year, the Women of Troy expect nothing less than to make their first appearance in the Final Four since 2007 and make to another title run.
At 10-0, Haley’s team seems to have the perfect balance of veteran leadership and promising young talents. In fact, the incoming class is so exceptional that Haley feels comfortable giving all of the freshmen considerable playing time, starting five out of the six freshmen on the team.
Heading into conference play, Haley recognizes that great Pac-10 coaches and great teams surround him. Out of 330 women’s volleyball teams competing at the Division I level, four from the Pac-10 conference stand among the nation’s top 10.
Although you might never hear it from the ever-humble Haley himself, the best coach of that bunch won’t compete against the Trojans this season — he’s already leading them.
great article.  Love Coach Mick Haley……I suggest all True Trojans support this great team….
They will need our help all season….the MPSF is the toughest conference in Women’s Volley.
Congrats to Coack Mick…
Fight ON!!

Politicians in California must now provide full disclosure on the Internet whenever they receive free tickets for a concert or sporting event, according to the Los Angeles Times.
The new rule was approved Friday by the California Fair Political Practices Commission, which is headed by USC professor Dan Schnur.
The new law was written after reports that Los Angeles Mayer Antonio Villaraigosa received tickets to sporting events, such as Los Angeles Dodgers games, over the past five years.
The rule will be effective in 30 days. Politicans must disclose information about the tickets and events on their official webpages, including a description of who provided the ticket.
“We support openness and transparency in government, and the mayor believes he has fully complied with existing law and will comply with this new rule when it goes into effect,” a Villaraigosa spokesperson said in an e-mail to the Times.

Skywriting poor use of funds
In response to the Aug. 27 article “Dedication ceremony commemorates opening” by Natalie Chau, I was alarmed to read that the Graduate and Professional Student Senate had purchased Ronald Tutor some skywriting as a gift.
While this generosity in normal circumstances should be applauded, one wonders at the wisdom of spending the money on a man who probably writes his Denny’s breakfast order in skywriting every day.
Although GPSS’ stimulus for the American skywriting industry might well help fend off low-cost competition from abroad, there are very many graduate students with more pressing concerns: printers that saw their glory days before Journey’s reformation with a new singer, conference registration fees that would make Ivanka Trump blush and a graduate student lounge (named to the tune of more G’s, but unable to exclude non-graduate students) that has mediocre coffee and a wall painted by someone seemingly in the mood for a dirty protest.
Could this money not have been put to better use?
Although I applaud the fiscal rectitude of a body that seemed to be running surpluses for years before the new Great Depression, these vanity projects would not be out of place in North Korea. Perhaps time to rethink some priorities?
Juvenal Cortez
Graduate student, politics and international relations
Juvenal makes a decent series of points here. Students are hard up: it is up to GPSS to help them out not spend money on stupid things.
This is bang on. Well said, Juve!

Many freshmen learn three key things by the end of their first week at USC. First, the one great thing Everybody’s Kitchen offers is a delightful hangover omelette. Second, touching someone’s pledge pin can get you into some sticky situations. And finally, you should never torrent on the campus wireless network.
Rita Yeung | Daily Trojan
I know I’m not the only one who is still adjusting my Internet activity and budget for this strict policy. It makes sense that a university with such esteemed art, music and film programs would be opposed to the concept of illegal file sharing. A certain ambiguity comes into play, however, when considering the less-often mentioned Institute for Multimedia Literacy.
I’m currently taking two classes at the IML. In my Languages of New Media (IML 101) class, our current assignment is to remix video and audio content to recontextualize the material. Prior to that, we edited photographs in the styles of graphic artists Barbara Kruger and Shepard Fairey, using Internet content for politically satirical imagery all our own.
But is it really all our own?
For instance, Fairey’s indisputably salient image was the Barack Obama “Hope” poster that revolutionized a political campaign — but of course, no good deed goes unpunished.
Fairey and The Associated Press are now engaged in a fair-use suit, in which the AP claims that he used a photograph taken by staffer Mannie Garcia without permission or proper attribution.
Fairey’s iconic work might just as soon be notable in the world of copyright and intellectual property.
We discussed the suit in IML and had to defend our own media usage. In the age of creative collaboration and remix, this is going to become an increasingly prominent issue for Millennials, especially in light of the entitlement complex our generation has developed regarding the free acquisition of intellectual property.
Our class concluded that more and more artists are going to have to see that downloading and remixing propagates the art, and despite what past generations might assume, mass distribution and high art are not mutually exclusive.
So when I sit down in the lab, creating a project that compiles the work of BBC’s art critic John Berger, clips from the Israeli animated documentary Waltz with Bashir and Radiohead tunes, I’m prompted to contemplate authorship.
Does this work really deserve personal attribution? Have I altered the aforementioned works enough to deem this original? If it’s ethically expected that we pay $10 at the theater or $5 at Blockbuster to see the documentary, is it conceivable that this is profitable content too?
I’ve entered the gray area that brings about lawsuits such as Fairey’s: granted, I’m no graphic design superstar responsible for unparalleled campaign successes, but it’s still an issue.
Although websites like Netflix and Hulu might help the more ethical among us sleep better at night, those endless streams of content for a mere few dollars a month are but a couple of skips away from haphazardly free media consumption. On the one hand, I can see how absurd it is that we aren’t willing to throw down a dollar and change for an MP3 of someone’s hard work and creative energy.
But on the other hand, whether the music and film industries are prepared or not, the fiscal model is changing in their world just as it is changing in the worlds of journalism and literature.
These woes will be ones for the head honchos at Universal Music Group and Paramount Pictures to ponder in the coming years. As for USC, how long will we be walking this tightrope of media hypocrisy?
Students are asked to incorporate work by critically acclaimed artists into their own original pieces and simultaneously chastised for moving with the times, wherein file sharing is commonplace and the boundaries of intellectual property are hazy at best.
For now, we’ll just have to be satisfied ripping DVD content from Leavey Library.

Despite a flashy performance from senior Allen Bradford in Saturday’s 32-21 win over Minnesota, incumbent junior Marc Tyler will remain the starting running back for the Trojans’ next game against Washington State on September 25.
Bradford piled up 131 yards on 12 carries, boosting his season average to 8.4 yards per carry. His electrifying 56-yard touchdown run with 8:32 left in the fourth quarter put the Trojans ahead and out of reach 32-14.
Meanwhile, Tyler struggled to make an impact against the Golden Gophers, running for just 33 yards against a defense that gave up 41 points to FCS opponent South Dakota.
“[Tyler] just ran OK,” admitted Kiffin after the game.
If the Trojans want to compete for the Pac-10 title, the running game has to improve. If Tyler doesn’t run wild over Washington State, who is giving up 40.7 points per game, that improvement might have to come from a change on the depth chart at running back.
After this Saturday, the Trojans’ schedule becomes significantly tougher. After a visit from Jake Locker, the potential No. 1 overall pick in the 2011 NFL Draft, and the Washington Huskies, the Trojans travel to No. 16 Stanford on October 9.
While USC has been struggling against the likes of Hawaii and Minnesota, Stanford has defeated UCLA and Wake Forest in its last two games by a combined score of 103-24. The Trojans haven’t even scored a total of 103 points in all three of their games.
The Trojans’ offense has the potential to be very explosive with the rotation of four solid backs and targets like Ronald Johnson and Robert Woods for Matt Barkley to throw to. But so far, the unit has played somewhat like a sleeping giant.
But they need to wake up — because the Trojans are about to enter the nightmarish part of their schedule.

Experts say gubernatorial candidate Meg Whitman’s economic plan will do little to bring more jobs to California if she were elected.
Whitman’s plans for the state include cutting taxes, easing regulations and bringing in more companies to stimulate the job market.
Stephen Levy, director and senior economist at the Center for Continuing Study of the California Economy, told the Los Angeles Times that California economics reflects more of the national trend than political trends.
“There are limits on what governors can do,” Levy said. “Most of what happens is governed by world and national and macro-economic forces that we struggle to grab hold of even with all the tools a federal government has.”
According to the L.A. Times, Whitman has used her experience as the chief executive office of eBay as a standing point for her campaign, emphasizing her knowledge of business and economics.
Democratic gubernatorial candidate Jerry Brown, the current California attorney general, has released a jobs plan that boosts the renewable-energy industry and reducing regulations.

There’s been a significant amount of buzz surrounding the box office this weekend and with good reason. Earlier in the year, the caustic but brilliant Joe Queenan dubbed 2010 the “worst movie year ever.” Or at least he made a point of panning Hollywood’s lack of originality.
But this weekend, audiences were actually forced to choose between several enticing and critically acclaimed films. Who would have thought? Will Gluck’s satiric and surprising Easy A, which clocked in at No. 2 in box office sales this weekend, and Ben Affleck’s gritty ensemble piece The Town, which took the No. 1 spot, were both widely released.
When it comes to the timely Catfish and the sweeping Never Let Me Go, I honestly cannot remember a weekend in which two films, original films I might add, sparked massive audience interest — regardless of not taking high spots in the box office.
We’ll forgive those that saw Devil instead. But as for M. Night Shyamalan? He’s still got a lot of apologizing to do.

During USC football’s home opener, many fans caught their first glance of the No. 3 USC men’s water polo team (8-0) as several returning players brandished their championship rings during a halftime ceremony honoring last year’s NCAA championship teams. Such swagger was justified this weekend, as the Trojans won the NorCal Tournament in Berkeley, Calif., topping three top-5 teams in the process.
Relishing the early-season opportunity to compete with other NCAA water polo heavyweights, the Trojans earned a spot in the NorCal Tournament’s semifinal round, after a 15-6 trouncing of Navy and a hard-fought 14-10 win over No. 5 UC Irvine. Against Navy, the Trojans took a narrow 8-5 lead into halftime, but managed to only surrender one goal in the second half. Four Trojans scored multiple goals, and the final outcome was never much in doubt.
After an afternoon respite, the Trojans returned to the Spieker Aquatics Complex to play, at the time, their highest-ranked opponent of the season, No. 5 UC Irvine. Freshman two-meter Jeremy Davie and junior two-meter Matt Burton led the offensive charge with hat tricks, as the Trojans managed to defeat the Anteaters much more convincingly than the final score would otherwise indicate, as UC Irvine managed late goals against primarily second-string players.
However, such games were peanuts compared to the two titanic matchups that awaited USC in the semifinal and championship rounds: No. 1 Cal and No. 2 UCLA. In the preseason, prognosticators considered USC’s young talent too unproven to repeat as NCAA champions, awarding the team a No. 3 national ranking despite its consecutive championships. USC coach Jovan Vavic said the team’s youth was a concern entering the tournament.
“Absolutely, because we’re so darn young and we’ve only been playing together for less than four weeks,” Vavic said. “Out of our starters, we have four players who didn’t play for us last year.”
In their semifinal contest against No. 1 Cal, the Trojans cruised into halftime all but assured of a victory with a commanding 8-4 lead. However, a third-quarter surge by the Cal offense tied the game at 10 apiece. If not for the heroics of junior goaltender Joel Dennerley, who made a clutch save with six seconds remaining in the fourth quarter, the game would have been sent to overtime.
The championship match against No. 2 UCLA followed a similar script as the Trojans amassed a sizable lead at the half, only to see the Bruins rally and take the lead in the fourth quarter. This time, the Trojans had to withstand a fourth quarter uptick in the Bruins’ play. Up to the task, junior driver Peter Kurzeka netted the winning goal in the waning moments of the game, thus completing his hat trick.
Although experience might help instill calm in players when facing pressure situations, talent does the heavy lifting and wins the games. Despite their youth, the Trojans showcased to their Mountain Pacific Sports Federaion foes the kind of talent these teams will face once MPSF play officially begins.
“It gives us great confidence moving forward. In both games we had big leads, and we threw them away. They were crazy games, but we didn’t give up,” Vavic said. “Our players stepped up. It was a complete team effort. Our goalie was outstanding. Jeremy Davie was wonderful in the semis, (freshman driver) Nikola (Vavic) had a great tournament, (sophomore driver) Tobias (Preuss) played well, and Burton was solid on defense. ”
Having knocked off six top-10 opponents already, USC is awaiting the No. 1 NCAA ranking. However, do not expect a change in the ranking to create an air of complacency at McDonald’s Swim Stadium practices.
“There are plenty of games left. We know what we need to do because we’ve done it the last two years,” Vavic said. “This was a huge tournament, but there are still lots of challenges remaining.”
