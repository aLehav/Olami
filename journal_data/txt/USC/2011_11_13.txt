The USC men’s and women’s swimming and diving teams had solid showings in the desert with the men’s team going 1-1 and the women going 2-0 in the teams’ first Pac-12 action.
The men lost on Friday to Arizona, 193.5-106.5, but rebounded to beat the Arizona State Sun Devils Saturday, 198-197. Highlighting the efforts in Tuscon were sophomore Vladimir Morozov, who won the 100-yard freestyle, and junior Chad Bobrosky, who won the 1,000-yard freestyle. Other winners included junior Justin DiFederico in the 200-yard fly and sophomore Dimitri Colupaev in the 200-yard freestyle.
The Trojans faired better during Saturday’s competition, with Colupaev winning the 200-yard freestyle and the 200-yard medley relay. Freshman Andrew Malone took first in the 100-yard breaststroke and Vladimir Morozov won the 50-yard freestyle. Junior Alex Lendrum took first in the 100-yard backstroke event.
On the women’s side, the weekend was highlighted by senior Katinka Hosszu, who won a total of five events over the course of two days. Against Arizona, she won the 200-yard backstroke, the 400-yard individual medley, and was part of the winning 400-yard freestyle relay team on Friday. Other winners against the Wildcats were junior Haley Anderson, who won the 500-yard freestyle and 1000-yard freestyle, and senior Victoria Ishimatsu, who won the 1-meter and 3-meter diving events. The Trojans beat the Wildcats 156-144.
Saturday brought more success for the women’s team, where it beat Arizona State, 198-99. Hosszu’s concluded her weekend winning the 200-yard freestyle and the 200-yard breaststroke. Anderson won the 1,000-yard freestyle and Amanda Smith won the 200-yard fly. Megan Hawthorne also won the 200-yard backstroke. Ishimatsu dominated the diving board once again, winning the 1-meter and 3-meter events.

The No. 1 USC men’s water polo team is back on top.
Tied with UCLA for the top ranking, the Trojans (19-2, 7-0) defeated No. 7 Pacific 11-9 in overtime last Saturday, one day before a 10-5 win over No. 13 Concordia at McDonald’s Swim Stadium on Senior Day.
Friday’s game saw the return of freshman driver Kostas Genidounias, who had been out with a hand injury.
“It’s a huge boost for our team,” USC coach Jovan Vavic said. “Having him back is really big for us.
The last home game for USC senior goalie Joel Dennerley and senior driver Peter Kurzeka, the Trojans came back from a shaky first half to decisively defeat the Eagles. Both teams were tied after the first quarter at 3-3, with Concordia responding to every USC goal with one of its own. Genidounias opened up the second quarter with a shot from the outside to give the Trojans a 4-3 lead, with sophomore two-meter Jeremy Davie quickly notching a goal of his own to increase the lead by two.
Defensive efforts by the Trojans could not stop two more goals from the Eagles, however, and the score evened to 5-5. Sophomore driver Nikola Vavic took advantage of a penalty shot to make it 6-5 in favor of the Trojans as half time rolled around.
“[In the first half] I think we took the opponent lightly and I don’t think we were mentally focused the way we usually are,” Vavic said. “There were a couple of defensive breakdowns as well. In the second half, we focused a lot better and Joel [Dennerley] did a lot better in the second half.”
The second half saw an invigorated USC team. Thanks to quick goals from junior driver Michael Rosenthal and junior driver Tobias Preuss, the Trojans secured an 8-5 lead. The Eagles would fail to score once in the second half thanks to Dennerley’s efforts in the cage. The senior goalie had 12 saves total.
Late in the third frame a goal from Kurzeka made him No. 13 on the all-time scoring list at USC with 132 career goals. Redshirt junior two-meter Brian Boswell notched the Trojans’ final goal of the game in the fourth, making the final score 10-5 in favor of USC.
In the Trojans’ game against Pacific, they found similar success, though under more pressure-filled circumstances. USC was taken into overtime after an action-packed game, but Preuss’ two goals in the first overtime period ensured a Trojan victory.
Nine different Trojans scored in the Pacific game, including Davie, Kurzeka, Genidounias and Boswell, something that speaks volumes about the team’s offensive abilities, according to Vavic.
“It is an indication that we can get more than more person to score goals and we are well balanced,” he said.

Playing in its last true road stand of the season, the No. 4 USC women’s volleyball team, led by senior outside hitter Alex Jupiter, swept No. 20 Oregon and Oregon State en route to a perfect 6-0 record last weekend.
Coupled with No. 1 UCLA’s loss to the Ducks (18-8, 11-7), on Friday, the Women of Troy (22-4, 17-2) are now alone atop the Pac-12 standings.
“Jupiter was extremely strong on all fronts this weekend with her serves, defense, and attacking,” USC coach Mick Haley said. “It was a big two-person effort with her and [sophomore outside hitter] Sara Shaw against Oregon, but what you don’t see is [junior outside hitter/opposite] Katie Fuller bouncing the ball off the floor and forcing the [Oregon State] defense.”
In front of an energized Oregon crowd, which waited until 8:30 p.m. to watch the match Saturday, USC came out of the gates on fire, catching the Ducks off-guard en route to 21 kills in a 25-21 first set.
Shaw finished off the 3-0 sweep with the last of her career-high 17 kills to end the third set, beating her previous high of 15 in a game.
Along with Shaw, Jupiter, who has been rewriting the USC record books this season and is slowly approaching the school’s all-time kills record held by Jennifer Kessy with 1,799, put in another stellar all-around performance Saturday.
With 21.5 points on the match, which included a career-high five service aces and 14 kills, Jupiter was the focal point of the team and her serving turned the tide of the third set.
Senior setter Kendall Batman has also played a key role in USC’s offensive surge. Bateman leads the Pac-12 with 12 sets per game, but she has recently been averaging more than 15 per match and has been the key facilitator for the Women of Troy attack.
Oregon, which was led by Alaina Bergsma with 13 digs, three aces, and five digs, seemed to do anything in their power to hit away from sophomore libero Natalie Hagglund and she actually failed to register a dig in the first set.
On Friday, the Pac-12-leading Women of Troy faced off against a stout Oregon State squad.
The Beavers hung tight with USC in the first set as it was deadlocked at 16. But the Women of Troy staved off Oregon State after senior middle blocker Lauren Williams’ kill, and a block and kill by sophomore middle blocker Alexis Olgard pushed USC to close the first set out.
The Beavers opened the second set strongly, taking an early 5-1 lead, but the Women of Troy responded with an 8-4 run of their own to knot it at nine apiece. But USC closed the second set on an 11-4 run to take a 2-0 lead in the match.
Schraer had almost as many blocks in the third set as USC had the entire match in helping the Women of Troy to victory. Defense at the net has been a point of contention for  Haley this season.
“We need to continue to work on our blocking and defense and they really go hand-in-hand,” he said. “If we can win games with our defense and our blocking can continue to improve, that’s when we’ll know.”

The No. 23 USC women’s basketball team started slow but finished strong to cap a 65-57 victory in its home season opener against Fresno State.
All-around play · Senior guard Jacki Gemelos recorded game-highs of 18 points and 10 rebounds. She also finished with five assists to help lead USC to victory over Fresno State at the Galen Center. - George Chearswat | Daily Trojan
“Fresno State is always a good rival for us and it’s a game we have to work extremely hard,” USC coach Michael Cooper said. “Never once did I think we were out of the game. I just thought we needed to continue to improve. I think we need to cut down on our turnovers, but at home it wasn’t too bad.”
The Bulldogs came out firing offensively, scoring the first 11 points of the contest in less than four minutes and putting the Women of Troy (1-0) in a deep deficit early. USC also committed five turnovers during that span.
“They came out so hard in the first half,” sophomore forward Cassie Harberts said. “I don’t think we were expecting them to come out as hard as they did, but I think that’s going to be every team that we face from now on.”
Despite trailing early, USC slowly crept back into the game behind the play of senior guard Briana Gilbreath. The Texas native scored the first points of the contest for USC and scored seven of the next 11 points for the Women of Troy. USC would go on a 7-0 run in the next two minutes to grab the lead at 18-17 midway through the first half.
USC clung to a one-point lead heading into halftime. Though the Women of Troy shot 45 percent from the field, they committed six turnovers.
USC started slow to begin the game, but it scored the first six points of the second half to take a seven-point lead at 35-28. The Bulldogs, however, hung around as the Women of Troy could never extend their lead until five minutes to play in the game.
Clinging to a two-point lead, back-to-back 3-pointers by senior guards Jacki Gemelos and Ashley Corral extended the lead to eight points with about 4:30 remaining in the contest. The lead would stretch to as much as 13 points with two minutes to play. The Women of Troy would preserve their first victory of the season with a final score of 65-57.
Gemelos finished with 18 points and 10 rebounds, while Harberts and Gilbreath combined for 30 points and 12 rebounds. Freshman forward Alexyz Vaioletama, in her USC debut, notched seven points, eight rebounds and five assists. Freshman guard Ariya Cook also notched two points and an assist in 23 minutes of play.
“Both [freshmen] played extremely well and what I’m trying to do is let them play a little more free basketball and reign them in as we go,” Cooper said.
With the new talent on the USC squad, Cooper hopes players like Gemelos, Gilbreath, Corral and Harberts will lead by example.
“The key with our core people is that they have the ability to make other players better, so that’s what going to eventually happen as we go through the process of finding out who we are and finding out who can do what,” Cooper said.
With its season opener out of the way, USC takes on Nebraska for its first road game of the season on Friday. With one victory in the win column, Gemelos sees this as something to build on for the rest of the season.
“I feel better than I ever have in the six years I’ve been here,” Gemelos said. “It’s good to be ranked 23rd because it’s only going to get better from here, and we’re expected to make the tournament this year and it’s going to happen.”

With six of nine players suiting up in cardinal and gold for the first time, the USC men’s basketball team looked to identify its strengths and weaknesses during the season opener Friday night at the Galen Center.
Offensively, in the 66-59 win over Cal State Northridge, the USC guards struggled against the Matadors’ zone defense. Trojan guards converted just six of 29 shot attempts, including zero shots from behind the 3-point line, and committed a combined 11 turnovers.
Shining star · In his USC debut, redshirt sophomore forward Dewayne Dedmon led the Trojans to victory with 16 points and nine rebounds. - Chris Pham | Daily Trojan
The Trojans (1-0) did manage to work the ball into the post, however, scoring 30 of 66 points in the paint. In his USC debut, redshirt sophomore forward Dewayne Dedmon scored 16 points and grabbed eight rebounds, while junior forward Aaron Fuller recorded 16 points and nine rebounds.
After 40 minutes of action, however, USC basketball coach Kevin O’Neill could not define his team’s offensive identity.
“I still do not know,” O’Neill said. “For the third year in a row, we have a new group, and this is the newest group that we have had.”
Defensively, the Trojans held the Matadors (0-1) to a 13.8 shooting percentage in the first half, establishing a new USC opponent record for the lowest shooting percentage in a half. For the game, USC made 42.6 percent of its shots, compared to just 25 percent for CSUN. The Trojans, however, struggled with foul trouble. Four of the five USC starters were called for three or more fouls.
“We did a relatively good job defensively for most of the game,” O’Neill said. “Our guys think this is a kung-fu match. That is not toughness. That is not smart basketball.”
The Matadors struggled on the offensive end to begin the game, making only 1 of 19 field goal attempts. The Trojans took advantage, jumping out to a 14-4 lead to start the game behind eight points from Dedmon.
Dedmon, however, picked up his second foul with 8:02 left in the opening half and remained on the bench until halftime. The Matadors managed to cut the lead to four points, but Fuller scored seven of his nine first-half points with Dedmon sidelined to send the Trojans into the locker room leading 29-21.
USC extended the lead to the nine points in the second half, but with Dedmon limited after picking up his third foul and suffering a cramp in his right leg, the Matadors battled back to tie the score at 42, and eventually take their first lead of the game at 52-50.
Sophomore guard Maurice Jones, who only shot 2-of-13 from the field in the game, got to the free throw line down the stretch, making nine of 11 free throws in the second half. He finished with 16 points and three assists.
“We were rudderless until [Jones] took over in the last four minutes and went into attack mode,” O’Neill said.
Jones, the captain of the squad and who has played the most minutes at USC despite only being a sophomore, scored seven of the Trojans’ final 14 points to clinch the victory.
“[CSUN] did a good job keeping their composure, but we also did a good job keeping ours,” O’Neill said.
With two 7-footers, junior center James Blasczyk and Dedmon, in addition to the 6-foot-6 Fuller, the Trojans enjoyed a significant height advantage. USC had 11 more rebounds than CSUN, and six more blocked shots, led by Dedmon, who recorded three.
“Coach wants the ball in the post so that we can make a play or find the open guy,” Fuller said.
Freshman guards Alexis Moore and Byron Wesley made their collegiate debuts. Moore struggled with his shot, finishing 1-of-9 from the field, including 0-of-7 from the 3-point line, and ended the night with six points. Wesley had five points and eight rebounds.
Senior walk-on guard Eric Strangis, starting for the first time, scored USC’s first two points of the season on a jump shot 36 seconds into the game. The basket was his first career points as a Trojan after appearing in six games and recording seven total minutes last season.
The Trojans are back in action tonight at home against Nebraska at 7:30 p.m.
In the last matchup of the two teams, in November of last year, USC held a 20-point lead in the first half before falling 60-58 in Lincoln.
The Cornhuskers (1-0) return four starters from the team that went 19-13 last season. The only active Trojans that competed in the game against Nebraska last season are sophomore forward Garret Jackson, Jones and Strangis.
“Right now we are nowhere near where we need to be to play the kind of schedule that we are playing,” O’Neill said. “But we are going to get better and improve.”

Over the last couple games, the Trojans have been affected by injuries on both sides of the ball. On Saturday, several players had to leave the game, but according to the coaching staff, none of the injuries suffered were believed to be serious.
Breakaway speed · Freshman wide receiver Marqise Lee returned an 88-yard kickoff for a touchdown to begin the second half for USC. - Luciano Nunez | Daily Trojan
Senior defensive tackle DaJohn Harris and sophomore cornerback Torin Harris were both labeled as game-time decisions entering Saturday’s game, but neither played.
Though Harris suited up and participated in pre-game warm-up drills, the coaching staff opted to replace him with redshirt freshman defensive tackle George Uko, who recorded 1.5 sacks.
Junior left tackle Matt Kalil had to leave the game for a brief moment in the third quarter and the coaching staff examined his chest/shoulder area on the sideline.
He did return, though. Junior safety T.J. McDonald did not play in the second half because of blurred vision.
Senior defensive tackle Christian Tupou also had to leave the game and held an ice pack on his surgically repaired left knee after the game.
USC coach Lane Kiffin noted after the game that on Thursday night, freshman wide receiver Marqise Lee had the flu and was sent to the health center.
According to Kiffin, the original plan was to use Lee sparingly. The Serra graduate, however, responded well in the early phases of the game and showed no lingering effects.
Lee finished with nine receptions for 74 yards and one touchdown. It was his eighth touchdown in his last eight games.
—
A strength for the USC team this season has been the play of its special teams. Against Washington, that same unit helped spur the Trojans to victory. Leading 7-3 in the second quarter and facing a 4th-and-9, redshirt junior punter Kyle Negrete fielded a snap and rushed 35 yards for a first down deep into Washington territory.
Negrete, who previously doubled as both a punter and linebacker at the University of San Diego, finished his run by running over his tackler and drawing approval from the crowd.
“There wasn’t a lot of juice right at that point,” Kiffin said. “The ball was getting closer to midfield and it was a look that we felt good at. [Special teams coach John] Baxter was a little bit nervous about going that far on 4th-and-9, but that’s who we are. We believe in our players and put it on our players to make plays.”
Though Kiffin instructed Negrete to slide after he picked up enough yards for the first down, the 6-foot, 210-pounder felt comfortable enough carrying the ball for additional yards.
“I haven’t seen green grass like that since I was playing in high school,” Negrete said.
To begin the second half, Lee returned an 88-yard kickoff for a touchdown, giving USC a 30-3 lead. It was his second consecutive two-touchdown game after notching his first multiple-touchdown game against Colorado.
—
For all of the praise Kiffin gave his defense and his role players for proving the team could win comfortably even without career days from junior quarterback Matt Barkley and sophomore wide receiver Robert Woods, he was equally dismayed with the number and nature of the Trojans’ penalties.
“The penalties today were embarrassing,” Kiffin said. “We were not a disciplined football team. We didn’t handle being ahead very well. We got too lackadaisical and did not play smart football.”
USC committed 11 penalties for 78 yards, including Kalil’s third personal foul penalty this season and junior cornerback Tony Burnett’s second consecutive game with a special teams penalty that negated a Woods return. Washington also committed 12 penalties for 91 yards.
At halftime, the Huskies had recorded more penalties, nine, than first downs, five.

Understand this: Kickoff between USC and Washington was scheduled for 12:45 p.m. It was in Los Angeles. Weather reports indicated rain was on the horizon.

None of those circumstances exactly forecasted a strong turnout from the Trojan faithful, as later indicated by the announced attendance of 64,576 — the lowest number for a homecoming game for USC in a decade.
If told beforehand USC wouldn’t crack at least 70,000, you likely wouldn’t have flinched. It wouldn’t have moved the needle much. You’d shrug, move on and mutter, “L.A. fans” or something along that line.
Barring some very strange twist, USC’s average attendance this season will be the lowest since 2002, no matter how many fans file through the gates for the Trojans’ season finale in two weeks against UCLA on Nov. 26.
Through six games this season, the average stands at 71,673. Provided somewhere near 90,000 fans show up against the Bruins, that number will move up, albeit rather gradually. It won’t better last season’s mark of 79,907 per contest.
With the Trojans serving the second year of a two-year postseason ban, an attendance drop on some level is to be expected. Eleven losses over the course of the last three seasons can do that to a program accustomed to Rose Bowls and national championships.
But that only makes the current circumstances all the more disappointing.
“If it wasn’t raining, I consider this a sold-out game,” sophomore cornerback Nickell Robey said. “[A sellout] lets us know we’re doing great things.”
In several respects, USC is achieving great things in spite of several obstacles. These current players, many freshmen and sophomores, were never dealt a favorable hand.
But for this season anyway, there are only a handful of teams in the country that can claim to be much better than USC, ranked No. 18 in the recently released Associated Press top-25 poll. The Trojans boast two players in junior quarterback Matt Barkley and sophomore wide receiver Robert Woods, who under normal conditions would garner consideration for the Heisman Trophy. Its defense is unquestionably its best since its Sports Illustrated-posing linebacker trio Brian Cushing, Clay Matthews and Rey Maualuga sported the cardinal and gold. Heck, even USC coach Lane Kiffin is being showered with praise in some circles.
There are plenty of feel-good stories as well: a starting tailback that was academically ineligible a season ago, a walk-on punter who outgained Washington on the ground in the first half. Most of all: a team that is winning and winning convincingly. Over the last two weeks, USC has upended the Huskies and Colorado by 48 points.
It begs the question: Where is everybody?
In recent years, most fans have done their fair share of complaining. They have continuously reminisced about Pete Carroll, holding Kiffin to that same lofty standard. They insisted the Tampa-2 defensive scheme couldn’t work, at least not on the college level.
By in large, USC has answered most of the critics this season, on average, winning by a 10-point margin through 10 games this season.
But fans can’t have it both ways. Most of this team’s issues have been addressed. There have been several doubts whether Kiffin and his staff were capable of clearing the metaphorical clouds that hover above the program — his analogy, not mine.
But as the second-year coach hinted at, those clouds are shifting.
“Just keep trying to move those clouds away,” Kiffin said. “A couple went away today. We’ll just keep trying to move them out of the sky and get some sun around here.”
It’s, in part, the problem with playing in Los Angeles. Fans want to watch teams that not only win but amass style points. For whatever reason, they’re not buying what USC is selling.
It’s not necessarily better across town either. UCLA, in five games at the Rose Bowl which seats over 90,000, is averaging just 56,505 per contest. But that’s the standard, whether that is fair or unfair.
For USC at least, 2012 could prove drastically different, depending on how many draft-eligible juniors opt to declare for the NFL draft.
So for now, with two games left, enjoy this team, because we don’t know how much longer this will last. The clouds might not keep moving.

Reading your articles seriously makes me depressed about USC football. About 90% of what you write is so pessimistic and negative. The fact that we are still keeping our head above water in these circumstances is commendable. We are playing for nothing tangible and the fact that there are still a loyal 70,000 plus at most games is commendable and says a lot about the loyal Trojan Family. Forget about the empty seats—they don’t matter—and focus on the people who have stuck by the Trojans every Saturday.
And Ricardo, I don’t think the student population has anything to do with it. The student section has actually been rather impressive this year (as has been mentioned by many players and coaches). Yeah, USC’s student population is changing (for the better), and I do not think this will have an impact on the football culture at USC.
There were many people selling tickets on and off campus on Saturday so actual sales might have been a lot more
than the people in the stands. Seems like close to kickoff many still tailgating outside the Coliseum wonder if they made it into the game. The bad weather forecast surely kept some ticket holders away if coming a distance.
Ricardo,
You hit the nail on the head. International students don’t have American Football as a priority.
Could the administrations insistance on continuously increasing the population of international of students, who don’t know or care about football, finally be catching up with our attendance figures? If so, what will attendance look like ten, twenty, thirty years from now?
Just a thought.

When USC nearly faltered against Arizona on Oct. 1 at home, a number of defensive issues overshadowed what strides its offense had made. It marked the first time in school history it had given up more than 40 points in consecutive games. The 37 first downs allowed were also a program first.
But more than a month later, it appears whatever remaining qualms there were regarding the Trojans’ defense have disappeared.
Bringing the heat · Junior defensive end Nick Perry recorded 2.5 sacks and five tackles against Washington on Saturday. As a unit, the USC defense notched seven sacks against the Huskies and also limited their rushing attack to just 46 rushing yards and 244 total yards of offense. - Brandon Hui | Daily Trojan
Facing Washington before a homecoming crowd of 64,756 at the Coliseum on Saturday, No. 18 USC (8-2, 5-2) surrendered just 244 total yards in a 40-17 rout of the visiting Huskies (6-4, 4-3).
“We’ve come a long ways on defense,” USC coach Lane Kiffin said. “It was great to see the pass rush come alive. If you play like that on defense, we’re going to be hard to beat.”
USC sacked Washington quarterbacks Keith Price and Nick Montana seven times — the most they have had in a game since registering eight against Washington State on Sept. 26, 2009.
“Everybody is being more competitive,” junior defensive end Nick Perry said. “We all compete in practice, and all those things showed up here today. We are better than last year and we’re showing that.”
At halftime, the Huskies, coached  by former USC offensive coordinator Steve Sarkisian, had more penalties — nine for 66 yards — than first downs, of which they had five, struggling to move the ball as the Trojans forced them into a wide number of third-and-longs.
In the early goings, USC struggled to get its own offense going. Though the Huskies did not record a first down until the waning moments of the first quarter, the Trojans were forced to punt on two of their first three drives.
Things eventually did click for USC.
Facing a fourth-and-nine and leading just 7-3 a few minutes into the second quarter, USC lined up to punt, but instead of kicking the ball into Washington territory, junior punter Kyle Negrete fielded the snap and raced down the north sidelines for 35 yards before being taken down at the Huskies’ 20-yard line.
“At that moment, it was time for us to call it,” Negrete said. “It was a player-called play. We got the ‘OK’ from [special teams] coach John Baxter, and we executed it perfectly.”
The Trojans would cap the drive on a 1-yard touchdown run from senior tailback Marc Tyler, giving them a 14-3 lead. On their next drive, fielding the ball near midfield, they marched 51 yards in five minutes for a score — coming by way of an 8-yard touchdown pass from junior quarterback Matt Barkley to freshman wide receiver Marqise Lee.
Lee, who was hospitalized with the flu Thursday night, finished with nine receptions for 74 yards and one touchdown.
“I didn’t want to sit out, so I called the coaches and told them,” Lee said. “I had a couple IVs Thursday night and Friday. It wasn’t a big deal. I feel good now.”
Kiffin, however, did make a point to emphasize the first-year wideout’s efforts in the moments following the team’s 23-point win.
“Twenty-four hours ago, this guy was in the health center and getting IVs and could barely get out of bed,” Kiffin said. “He’s competitive and that’s why he’s successful. He’s going to be one of the greats to play here for sure.”
Lee opened the second half with a bang as well, fielding the kickoff and returning it 88 yards for a score to give USC a 30-3 lead.
Though it did relinquish two touchdowns in the final two quarters, USC’s defense proved all too much again, limiting the Huskies to just 153 total yards — with 69 coming on their final drive of the game against many of USC’s second-and-third teamers.
“We’re really happy with the progress we’ve made in that aspect from where we were last year,” Kiffin said. “The sacks, pressure on the quarterback and pass defense as well as special teams play really sparked us today.”
The win came despite an offensive attack that seemed to rely on its ground game for arguably the first time all season, as sophomore wide receiver Robert Woods had just two catches for five yards. It marked his lowest totals of the year.
“It proves that [Woods] is not just our offense,” said Barkley, who threw for a season-low 174 yards. “We knew that coming into the game, we’d be able to run the ball on them. But we do have a lot of personnel who can make plays, so that’s good to see.”
Redshirt junior tailback Curtis McNeal keyed the Trojans’ running attack, rushing for a career-high 148 yards on 18 carries, including a 79-yard touchdown run midway through the third quarter. Tyler also added 50 yards on seven carries.
“I’m just trying to make the plays,” McNeal said. “The o-line, tight ends and quarterbacks are giving me great blocks to make the plays. [Barkley] is giving me the guidance, and the line makes it easy for us.”
With two games remaining on its 2011 slate, which ends Nov. 26 against UCLA, USC travels to Eugene, Ore., to face No. 7 Oregon on Saturday.
The Ducks, ranked No. 1 at the time, beat the Trojans last season at the Coliseum 53-32.

Alcohol-related hospital transports at USC from the beginning of the school year through October decreased by 20 percent compared to the same time frame last year.
From August through October there were 40 alcohol-related transports compared to 51 from August 2010 through October 2010.
Dept. of Public Safety Capt. David Carlisle said he hopes the drop is a direct result of education efforts on the part of DPS, particularly the ones focused on the Greek community.
“We’d like to think it’s the impact of the education of our crime prevention staff,” Carlisle said. “Our officers have been reaching out to the Greek community and have conducted a four-hour program with each house.”
Part of the new policy is the designation of risk managers who help ensure parties remain under control on The Row.
“What the [risk managers] do is basically be the people designated to be sober at parties, making sure people don’t overindulge,” Carlisle said. “We emphasize the Trojans Care for Trojans program and this is just an extension of a program that already exists in the residence halls on campus.”
David Crary, a senior majoring in applied and computational mathematics and economics, said the increased emphasis on safety in the Greek community makes its members more cognizant, leading to the decrease in transports.
“Fraternities are being more vigilant about safety, since we understand that transports look bad upon the Greek community as a whole,” Crary said. “Transports shouldn’t even be happening in the first place.”
Mina Saffarian, a freshman majoring in global health and a member of the Greek community, said some members of the Greek community have been more careful this year because they know an increase in transports would reflect negatively on the community.
“We know that if we get more transports, the Greek system could be penalized, which is a strong deterrent from being unsafe at parties,” Saffarian said.
Educating members of the Greek community on the effects of alcohol has been a helpful tool in preventing alcohol-related hospital transports, Saffarian said.
“Greek life education could be very helpful to many new members of the Greek community, since it provides real life scenarios that could help someone if they are ever in that situation,” Saffarian said.
Isabelle Mason, a freshman majoring in international relations (global business), said the embarrassment of being transported to the hospital after excessive consumption encourages students to be safe when drinking.
“Seeing other people being in bad situations and getting transported is a large incentive for most people to be safe while drinking because they would not want to be in that situation themselves,” Mason said.
Carlisle said the decrease in transports does not appear to be a consistent trend, as data for November as of Friday suggests transports occurrence is on track for similar numbers to those of last November.
My son is in the greek system. He even lives in a fraternity house. It is a struggle but he reads the bible every day and knows the bible.  The problem here is a lack of faith and a lack of following HIS word. Sorority hussies raised by parents that like to “party party PARTY” .  I see them.  They walk around in skimpy outfits drinking cheap white wines right out of the bottle.  Don’t blame it on my son, when it’s your daughter who acts like a whore.  On yes John 52 – im a goof ball parent.  A goof ball for the Lord and proud of it!
To the above poster, that has nothing to do with USC and everything to do with greek life. If you have such a huge problem with it, take your daughter out of her sorority but don’t act like it is USC as a whole that is all party party party.
Back in our day, we knew how to handle our alcohol.  No one ever got an ambulance ride for too many beers.  I’m ashamed of your weak generation!  
God help American survive these kids and their goof-ball parents!
As the parent of a freshman student who is involved in greek life, I can say that the stories my child relates to me are horrifying.  The use and abuse of alcohol is alarming. Many close calls that go unreported for fear of reprimand. The social culture at USC is all about party party PARTY!  Academics in greek life?  Not so much. Was unhappy to see the alcohol flowing so freely at recent parent’s weekend in the fraternities.  Is this what we are paying so much for?

The Community Health Involvement Project joined the Asian American Tutorial Project for the first time Saturday to teach elementary school students about health issues in addition to offering academic assistance.

About 200 AATP members tutor students at Castelar Elementary School in math and English one-on-one every Saturday. CHIP runs children’s health sites to educate a wide range of students about health topics such as nutrition, exercise and the body.
Jean Doh, the co-coordinator of one of CHIP’s health sites, said the collaboration started because some students are members of both organizations.
“AATP and CHIP are very similar organizations and many students from each organization already knew each other,” Doh said.
After the morning lessons with the AATP members, 12 students from CHIP tutored the kids on a variety of health issues, such as good eating habits and the importance of vitamins.
“We tried to make it a more fun type of learning through a variety of games and drawing exercises,” Doh said. “The main point we tried to communicate to the kids was the importance of a well-balanced diet, which includes a variety of different foods like meat, dairy products, vegetables and fruits.”
Doh said she was surprised at the scale of the event organized by AATP and at the diversity of the AATP’s team, which included students from USC, UCLA and Occidental College.
“It was a fun experience,” Doh said. “I had no idea that AATP had so many members, but it’s awesome to see volunteers from so many different schools working towards a single goal.”
AATP Administrative Director Peony Khoo said AATP would definitely like to have CHIP come back to coordinate with them each semester or each year.
“The event went really well and the kids learned a lot from the CHIP team,” Khoo said. “It’s important for them to learn about health and good nutrition because these are not things that they learn in school.”
AATP has been traveling to Chinatown to tutoring children from Castelar for about 41 years.

Yoki’s Garden, which will open a store in the University Village selling clothing and accessories  made from game-worn USC athletic gear, was named the first winner of Trojan Start-Ups Student Business Challenge.
The plan won Derek Belch, a first year graduate student studying business administration, a semester of free rent in the U.V. after completing businesses gave their final pitches Friday. The business will be located at the site of  the former USC Blood Donor Center.

Three groups pitched their business plans at the final pitch event.
“The product has been selling on Saturdays before football games so now we’re exited to be selling our clothing on campus full-time, around the clock,” Belch said. “As Marshall students, it’s great to have a couple guys from our class being able to be the first students to have a business at the U.V. and really see the fruits of our labor take off.”
Trojan Start-Ups was founded this semester by a team of seven students from The Art and Adventure of Leadership (MDA 365), which was taught by former USC President Steven B. Sample and  USC Leadership Institute Founding Chairman Warren Bennis. Trojan Start-Ups member Sarah Barrett, a senior majoring in business administration, said the class decided to start the organization to provide students with a business opportunity they hope will thrive in the future.
“Our group project for the class was to observe and practice leadership,” Barrett said. “It really struck a chord with us to have a space for student entrepreneurs and to have it be an integral part of our campus and student experience.”
Alex Park, a senior majoring in business administration and the creator of MOVE!, a business devoted to providing exciting group exercise classes, said he wants to develop a relationship with his customers that goes beyond the one hour per week they partake in a fitness class.
“When you come in, we’ll know your name and we’ll know what your working towards,” Park said. “As the owners, we want the students to know we are there for them.”
Austin Hay, a senior majoring in environmental engineering and creator of USC TechForce, said the competition has helped encourage him to develop a comprehensive business plan, including finding sponsors and sources of capital.
“As a part of our business plan, we have figured out our capital cost and received funding from other businesses as well as support from our friends and family,” Hay said.
Six expert judges consisting of university officials, representatives from USC Real Estate and Asset Management, sponsors and experienced alumni entrepreneurs judged the finalists based on the criteria of exemplifying entrepreneurial leadership and the ability to lead a support system for fellow Trojans.
“Of the final competing businesses, we have seen students who have demonstrated such leadership capacity and such a passion for their project that wouldn’t have come to fruition if it wasn’t for Trojan Start-ups,” said Chris Makiuchi, a senior majoring in business administration and a student in The Art of Leadership.
Though most of the organization’s founding members are seniors, they hope the organization and competition will become an annual event.
“We’re developing the framework for not only our project but our organization framework for the future,” said Trojan Start-Ups member Christianna Kyriacou, a senior majoring in print and digital journalism and political science. “We will be inviting other students who have an interest in supporting that sense of innovation and entrepreneurship at USC to help carry on this program in the years to come.”

When a film that plays so transparently to Academy voters falls short of its aims, it’s hard to muster up much in the way of sympathy. Starring Leonardo DiCaprio and helmed by screen icon and veteran director Clint Eastwood, J. Edgar might be the most compelling cautionary tale in recent years to warn of the potential pitfalls of unchecked Oscar aspirations.
Political picture · Leonardo DiCaprio portrays a complex, emotional persona as J. Edgar, but his character only scratches the film’s surface. J. Edgar ultimately shies away from its full potential. - Photo courtesy of Warner Bros. Pictures
J. Edgar tells a story about — not to be confused with “the story of” — J. Edgar Hoover, longtime head of the Bureau of Investigation, the agency he shaped into the FBI we know today. His obsession with national security was legendary and his disregard for privacy — notorious.
Academy Award-winner Dustin Lance Black’s script certainly invites criticism for the apparently gratuitous license Black takes in selectively incorporating verifiable fact and simple, if pervasive, speculation; Hoover’s public life and (ironically) well-documented accomplishments didn’t inspire J. Edgar nearly as much as did the more salacious rumors surrounding the man’s personal life. Much of the story concerns intimate details of Hoover’s relationships with his mother Annie (Judi Dench) and his right-hand man in the bureau, Clyde Tolson (Armie Hammer).
The portrait Black paints unambiguously insinuates that Hoover was a conflicted mama’s boy who, for fear of disappointing his mother, kept his true sexual orientation secret his entire life. As a character, J. Edgar Hoover offers an actor a tremendous opportunity to explore restrained emotionality and repressed feelings, and even as experienced an actor as DiCaprio would be warranted in feeling intimidated by the challenge of unpacking Hoover’s complex psychology.
Audiences learn details of Hoover’s early career and about the growth of the bureau through a structured frame story, initiating a number of engaging stories, many of which seemed to fall by the wayside as the film became increasingly focused on Hoover’s relationship with his second in command, Tolson.
The young Hoover of 1919 to whom we’re introduced is forever changed by the ineffectual forensic handling of a Bolshevik bombing, occurring in a time when collecting evidence took a back seat to sweeping up and hosing down the crime scene.
The scenes at once set up Hoover’s career-spanning paranoia over threats to national security as well as his meticulous attention to detail and scientific-mindedness — under Hoover, the FBI completely revolutionized crime scene evidence collection, a matter that was only addressed superficially as it took a back seat to Hoover and Tolson’s relationship.
J. Edgar leaves a few questions unanswered, although none related to unresolved story issues. The question of why it was decided that four-inch-thick facial prosthetics that left DiCaprio’s and Hammer’s faces every bit as lifeless as any Madame Tussaud creation was a good idea isn’t the most troubling of these questions, but it’s certainly the most distracting.
A better question might include how could any filmmaker so grossly underutilize talented actresses, such as Naomi Watts, who plays Hoover’s trusted secretary of nearly half a century Helen Gandy, as well as that great Dame, Judi Dench, who, despite having one dramatically charged conversation with her son late in the film, is lamentably one-note throughout.
Another question might relate to how Hoover’s penchant for illegal wiretapping was not figured more centrally in the film — after all, extraordinary surveillance practically defines Hoover’s legacy.
But it’s unfair to judge a film for something it isn’t, or things it didn’t set out to do. Black, who also wrote 2008’s Milk, was inarguably fixated on Hoover’s relationships, however, so one glaring oversight stands out as particularly inexcusable.
For a movie that purports to offer a psychological exploration of J. Edgar Hoover (it certainly makes no pretense of being a historical record), failing to explain how Hoover managed to inspire the curious levels of commitment and loyalty he did in others is a significant oversight.
Pay no attention to the fact that Eastwood’s vision of the ’20s aesthetically resembles the stylized stillness of a Frank Miller graphic novel adaptation, or the fact that DiCaprio goes through more accents in J. Edgar than Kristen Wiig in a typical taping of Saturday Night Live.
Overall, J. Edgar is a beautifully shot period drama that won’t be forgotten come awards season. But considering the veritable constellation of stars involved with the project behind and in front of the camera, audiences wouldn’t be in the wrong for expecting better.

Fried chicken. The name evokes aromas of seasonings and savory meats. It might be a dish synonymous with fast food and humble beginnings, but for years, it has  provoked strong, gustatory emotions from people all over the world.
Southern Thai · Fried chicken from Jitlada on Sunset Boulevard is just one of the many exotic renditions of fried chicken Los Angeles has to offer. - Sophia Lee | Daily Trojan
In America specifically, fried chicken is most commonly associated with Southern soul food. Scottish immigrants first brought their love for fried chicken into America, but the cooking process was adapted and popularized by African-Americans during the plantation period who often had to somehow make do with meat scraps and leftover lard. Since frying was the cheapest and tastiest way to savor random chicken parts, African-Americans brought their own touch into the dish with non-Scottish seasonings and spices.
The meal is served in unique forms in other parts of the world, distinguished by the different spices and seasonings, the frying techniques, the accompanying dishes and the traditions that surround it.
Here is an extensive list of the different fried chicken available in Los Angeles:
Roscoe’s House of Chicken and Waffles
Roscoe’s is an icon on its own — at least to many loyal Angelenos. Though the combination of fried chicken and syrup-soaked waffles has its origins on the East Coast, the delightful juxtaposition of breakfast carbs and scrap meat has generated a giant fan base on the West Coast as well.
At Roscoe’s, it’s not just about the juicy chicken meat or the butter-soaked waffles. It’s about the brilliant hedonism of fat and carbs dunked in rich gravy, with more butter, sweet jam and syrup drizzled all over.
Japanese karaage
Instead of wings and drumsticks, Japanese fried chicken, typically made from chicken thighs, is chopped into bite-size pieces. The meat is marinated in traditional Japanese ingredients, such as soy sauce and ginger, dusted in potato starch flour and dunked in oil. A citrus-y burst of lemon juice is always squeezed over the meat before eating, which might be what makes this Japanese fried chicken feel light instead of greasy.
Chicken karaage is served in numerous Japanese restaurants in Los Angeles, but one of the most notable eateries is Aburiya Toranoko, a Little Tokyo Japanese fusion tapas house. Aburiya prepares light, crunchy yet succulent morsels made from local jidori (a special type of free-range vegetarian poultry) chicken sprinkled with oroshi sesame seeds before being flash-fried.
Korean Fried Chicken
There are two things to expect with Korean fried chicken: pickles and delivery. Instead of blue cheese or gravy, a dish of pickled radish comes on the side to cleanse the palate. Korean fried chicken allures with its seasoning and its delightful, thin crust. The skin is a separate component in itself, a glistening, flavor-soaked yet non-greasy outer layer that preserves the natural juices of the encased flesh.
The secret of that unique crust is in the fry method: Korean-style fried chicken is fried in a way that renders out the fat in the skin so it tightens up into a paper-thin, ultra-crispy crust, cooled, then fried again to perfect golden smoothness. The chicken is dunked in sauce; if fried right, the sauce coats and clings to the skin. There is typically two flavor options: a mild, sweet garlic-soy glaze or a spicy, sticky red pepper saturation.
You can get Korean fried chicken at several places in Koreatown: Drunken Chicken (formerly Kyochon) and Bonchon, both on Sixth Street, are two popular choices among the Korean community.
Filipino fried chicken
Popular Filipino fried chicken can really be traced to one restaurant: Max’s of Manila, where a Filipino woman sold her cooking and business smarts to the American troops stationed in Quezon City, Philippines and wowed them with her fried chicken.
Similar to Korean-style fried chicken, Filipino fried chicken is cooked more than once to achieve an ethereal layer of crisp skin. The difference, however, is that the chicken is boiled or steamed lightly first, then fried twice. Though the cooking process is more laborious, the ingredients are minimal, usually consisting of whole chicken, coarse salt, pepper and oil.
Glendale is home to one of Max’s Restaurant’s several international franchises.
Thai fried chicken
Fried chicken is a popular street food in Thailand that appears in different forms depending on which area you visit, but one of the most famous is from Hat Yai in southern Thailand.
This Thai chicken is stubby, entirely dry and coarse to the touch without a drop of oil. Small chicken pieces are slathered in paste ground from garlic, coriander seeds and white pepper and marinated in fish sauce and sugar. The mixture is sprinkled liberally with fine, velvety rice flour and then double-fried. The first dip into the oil is almost simmered in low heat, and the second dip is a quick fry on high heat.
One of the best places to snack on this rendition of fried chicken is Jitlada on Sunset Boulevard, where plump, bone-in drumsticks are served on top of red-leaf lettuce and generously sprinkled with dangerously addictive fried garlic and shallots that taste remarkably like well-seasoned, crushed peanuts. A sweet and sour chili sauce is served on the side, but the basic salt-and-pepper seasoning is so perfect you barely need the sauce.

Drunken Chicken was formerly Bonchon.  
KyoChon is still located on 6th and Serrano.  KyoChon also brushes on the sauce not dunked in.

Pedro Almodóvar can best be described as provocative.
Spanish star · Esteemed director and screenwriter, Pedro Almodóvar (center), discussed at Bovard Auditorium on Friday night his career as a progressive, thought-provoking and scandalous filmmaker. - Nathaniel Gonzalez | Daily Trojan
The internationally celebrated Spanish filmmaker is noteworthy for his controversial subject matter and exuberant film style — not to mention, his Oscar-winning film Talk to Her and his breakout success Women on the Verge of a Nervous Breakdown.
On Friday night at “An Evening with Pedro Almodóvar: A Visions and Voices Signature Event” — in conjunction with USC’s School of Cinematic Arts — Bovard Auditorium housed one of cinema’s greatest contributors, who discussed his career and artistic style in good humor and with his trademark charismatic flair.
A couple hours hardly suffice to capture the brilliance of Almodóvar, but screening clips of All About My Mother, Talk to Her and The Skin I Live In served as a decent start.
The attention, however, quickly turned to Almodóvar, the auteur himself, who immediately jumped into his early career, describing such in broken yet endearing English.
“My school was to every day go to the cinematheque,” Almodóvar said.
A self-taught filmmaker, Almodóvar had always dreamed of attending film school in Madrid but suffered from the school’s closure because of dictator Francisco Franco’s regime in Spain, thus catalyzing Almodóvar’s home-brew filmmaking method.
With his unconventional but advancing developments in style and technique came Almodóvar’s rebellious attitude, a symbol for “la movida” — the reaction against Franco’s dictatorial rule of conservatism and censorship. His early work epitomized the true spirit of the progressive movement.
“The main feeling was just to be there, to live there,” Almodóvar said.
But Almodóvar is more than a mere symbol of the 1980’s Spanish counterculture. He is an expert and extroverted filmmaker full of zest.
“I need to feel that passion,” Almodóvar said. “If I don’t feel it, I don’t do it.”
This passion is not just a result of the Franco-induced repression. Instead, his vigor has continued through today, coming from deep within.
“This kind of life has lead me to introspection and I think my films have really reflected that — which doesn’t mean I’m always thinking about myself,” Almodóvar said, inciting uproarious laughter from the audience.
Almodóvar’s contagious vivacity and dedication to his art sets the stylistic bar for his films — full of outrageous themes and vivid imagery — yet it contributes in part to his hesitance to make an American film. Speculations regarding Almodóvar’s Hollywood breakout have brewed for years. The acclaimed director, however, maintained quite the opposite of the rumors.
“My way of working was much more free than here,” Almodóvar said. “My roots are absolutely Spanish.”
There’s more to Almodóvar than his avant-garde style and his devout sense of patriotism to Spanish national cinema — there also exists an effervescent sense of humor. For instance, the electric Spaniard noted the difficulty in pronouncing his name, almost as if this admission was routine but still said in good spirit.
“If it were the start of my career, I would be Peter Smith,” Almodóvar said.
It is this ability to poke fun at himself that allows his provocative content to flourish and make heavy themes like lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender subject matter while also allowing death and loss to appeal to mainstream audiences.
Almodóvar hopes to incorporate this sense of humor in future endeavors with a Spanish comedy and an English film. The director, most notable for his work in melodrama, is clearly looking in new directions. And though he has no current interest in Hollywood film, he wants to experiment and broaden his language horizons, proving that this innovative director has the capacity to take his experimentation even further.
The evening ended with Almodóvar’s reception of the Sergei Eisenstein Award, named after the Russian filmmaker and selectively awarded to only two previous recipients — Agnes Varda and Costa Gavras — for Almodóvar’s contributions to the expansion and revitalization of Spanish cinema which thereby created a worldwide dialogue.
Almodóvar graciously accepted and responded using a comical tone of course.
“It’s a kind of pleasure that lasts more than sex,” Almodóvar said.
Almodóvar’s latest film, The Skin I Live In, is currently playing in theaters.

There’s a mini war going on in Los Angeles.
Rita Yeung | Daily Trojan
On one side of a lawsuit are five parents backed by an advocacy group, who are suing Los Angeles Unified School District for not following a 40-year-old state law that requires student performance data be linked to teacher evaluations.
On the other side is LAUSD and its teachers union fighting to keep standardized test scores separate from the school district’s teacher evaluation system.
The lawsuit is one puzzle piece of a much larger issue affecting all levels of education: allowing test scores and data to dictate the way teachers teach and the way students learn.
Last spring LAUSD implemented an evaluation system that generates a teacher’s effectiveness rating based on students’ past and predicted future test scores.
The lawsuit also sheds light on a critical need, from the lower to university level, for new teacher assessment systems.
The group of parents are invoking the 40-year-old law, the Stull Act, in order to force action on a current stalemate between the L.A. superintendent and the teachers union over performance reviews. The parents and advocacy group filed suit last week, on the same day as a district deadline for settling contract provisions, some of which involve teacher evaluations.
LAUSD should be able to look toward higher education for a positive example of teacher assessment. The system at USC, however, is in need for a makeover as well.
For universities, mid-and end-of-the-semester evaluations, in addition to RateMyProfessors.com, just don’t cut it. The data collected from these mid-semester and end-of-semester evaluations is hard to find. The Office of the Provost publishes unique course and teacher evaluations, specific to term, every semester on the Student Affairs Information Technology website. This site, however, is not publicized to the degree it needs to be.
If the student body was adequately informed about the site, it would easily supplant RateMyProfessors.com.
The Office of the Provost site, however, has its flaws. The surveys taken during the year are very specific and not open-ended. The site should add a section where students can add paragraph responses to teacher evaluations, by addressing any complaints or questions not answered by the surveys.
Data-based evaluations pressure teachers to teach to the test. This can fundamentally weaken children’s education from kindergarten to 12th grade. If LAUSD loses the lawsuit, education from the K-12 level could become more about passing a test than the love of learning.
LAUSD, despite budget cuts, is actively trying to become a progressive and premier school district in the nation. By fighting such an antiquated law, they are making a concerted effort to re-evaluate their system.
Just five parents have managed to create a monumental problem — legal and academic — for an already broken system.
A number of California teachers have been accused of helping students cheat this year, as reported by the Los Angeles Times. The driving force for cheating is feeling the pressure to raise standardized test scores.
How is creating more of that pressure going to promote a student’s right to educational equality and opportunity?
As a whole, the educational system needs to re-assess teacher evaluations and the method in which we make them available.
 
Elena Kadvany is a senior majoring in Spanish. Her column “Beyond the Classroom” runs Mondays. 
If students continue to be socially promoted through grade after grade at LAUSD without fundamental skills in English or math, why would you hold a 12th grade teacher responsible for a student with a 3rd grade reading ability not being able to pass his or any other class where the student has been consciously put into a single-subject credentialed teacher’s class without the skills necessary to do the work.
And yet superintendent after superintendent comes into LAUSD only to be immediately anointed by the mainstream media as public education expert although none of them have done anything to stop student failure, which they and not the teachers have the power to do.
Superintendent Deasy, like 43% of public school superintendents around this country are graduates of the Broad Academy, which along with the Gates Foundation want to privatize the $250-$370 billion a year public education “business” – think credit default swaps and sub prime meltdown if you want to know where this is going. At http://www.perdaily.com we tell about what is really going on at LAUSD/UTLA, which neither the mainstream media nor the Gates/Broad subsidized NPR refuse to publish. Check it out and decide for yourself. At perdaily, we will never ask you to believe what we cannot prove.
Thank you, thank you, thank you.  Our kids have been used by pawns dictated by the unions.  Last week I read teachers have no time or money to teach science.  Of course it’s not tested so it’s off the priority list.  There’s time to give illegals special attention.  There’s time to give sex education to first graders…in detail.  Our teachers are constantly asking for higher benefits and higher pensions. Did you know 40% of the states budget shortly is for union benefits and pensions?  We’ve asked them to contribute to health care and pensions and of course they are furious of the thought.  Can’t fire them and our kids suffer.  How can our kids benefit if they constantly picket or now they are marching with the wall street crowd.  Parents have to take a bigger part and vote these liberals out of office.  Let’s help our kids.  Again thank you.

Last week director Brett Ratner held a Q&A session after an advance screening of his newest film, Tower Heist. It was there that he quipped that “rehearsal is for fags.”
Cue the inferno of criticism.
The backlash was intense and swift. The Gay and Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation got involved, and there were cries for his resignation as producer of the Oscars. And though Academy President Tom Sherak seemed to forgive him, the pressure got to Ratner. He resigned from his position Tuesday.
It’s clear why he stepped down: He offended countless people with the slur and embarrassed the academy.
But then again, it’s baffling when you consider the details. This was no extended rant, a la Mel Gibson. Nor did Ratner even mean the word in it’s literal meaning. It was an off-the-cuff slip of a slang term.
Why didn’t critics simply forgive and forget?
“Sticks and stones may break my bones, but words will never hurt me,” we were told as children, as if understanding that words aren’t tangible weapons is a point of pride.
But the outrage surrounding Ratner’s sophomoric, clumsy utterance proves words do hurt, and hurt a lot.
In fact, this incident — along with others, such as Tracy Morgan’s gay-joke failure in a June stand-up performance — reveals a society so frightened, so sensitive to potential gaffes, that we might as well be wearing earplugs.
Campaigns against such words have gone high-profile with stars, such as Hillary Duff and Jane Lynch, joining in to promote greater awareness of how slurs can harm. It’s all well-intended, and minimizing the use of offensive words is a valiant goal.
But just go to an average schoolyard and one thing will become clear: the use of racial, religious and homophobic slurs is pervasive and entrenched. You’ll hear slurs everywhere.
In many cases — Ratner’s included — these words aren’t meant to harm in the literal sense.
As controversial rapper and Odd Future leader Tyler the Creator pointed out, these words have lost their meaning to many who use them.
The lexicon of American slang has always been a fluid one. Today, terms like “idiot” and “imbecile” slip off our tongues without much hesitation. Yet “retard” is considered an offensive slur.
Why? In the 19th and early 20th centuries, “idiot” served as a medical term to describe severe mental retardation. How come people aren’t causing an uproar about the pervasive use of “idiot” today?
“Idiot” lost its technical connotations to mental disabilities. And it’s no stretch to assume the same will happen to slurs considered offensive today.
Here’s the bottom line: words can be weapons, and they can hurt. This is undeniable.
But trying to stem the casual use of slurs is an uphill battle even Sisyphus wouldn’t want to touch. After all, offensive language is cyclical — when one insult goes away, others will inevitably come to take its place.
Wouldn’t we rather that slurs didn’t faze us at all? Wouldn’t we rather imagine a world where such terms simply served as boring language for uncreative people?
Slurs don’t deserve their power, their edge. But the commotion caused by groups such as GLAAD over unintentional gaffes only help to add weight and significance to words that shouldn’t mean anything at all.
Sometimes, dulling a knife works better than hiding a sharp one.

More important is that there was no use of the tobacco drug in Tower Heist. Hurray!
I noticed that, too. Good for them. Smoking ruins a movie.
Political correctness runs our society. As liberalism always does, it’s an overcorrection to a problem that needed fixing. Racism and the like were pervasive years ago, now we have to make sure we don’t use the wrong word at the wrong time lest you be thrown into prison for thinking something that could be construed as offensive. I wonder how many of these lovely liberals stopped listening to Michael Jackson because he molested children. Or stopped watching football after Michael Vick killed dogs. Or renounced their support of Bill Clinton because he repeatedly cheated on his wife and sexually harassed interns. Or condemn the occupy “movement” when they become violent and take craps on people’s doorsteps. Those are things that are offensive as well, but they don’t fit into the liberal agenda therefore they’re tolerated and accepted. Liberals do an excellent job of getting riled up about things they’re passionate about and ignoring everything else. And as we all know, every college (including SC)  is full of brainwashed liberals.
Under the author’s premise, we should also forgive the use of n*****, w****** and c****. It is inexcusable what Ratner did.
And to the sticks and stones line, it is much easier to heal a physical wound than an emotional wound. No matter how hard we try, words hurt, and cut much deeper.
SERIOUSLY? Do you understand how hurtful these words are? Though people are FINALLY starting to cause a stir about these remarks does not in any way mean they should be accepted and not criticized. Any derogatory term used by anyone, especially people on a platform, needs to be called out. You have no argument here, and are just as bad as the person saying it in my opinion.
I meant to say “are only FINALLY”.
This article is even more offensive than what Ratner said. Congratulations. 
Offensive words always hold the power to hurt, regardless of how people intend them. It doesn’t matter how people intend their words, if their words still end up deeply offending or alienating an individual. For example, in situations of verbal sexual harassment, such as an employee at work telling an offensive joke about women, it doesn’t matter whether the employee was only “being funny” and “didn’t want to hurt anyone” — the employee will still be held accountable for sexual harassment, regardless of his intent. The fact of the matter is that he offended and alienated another individual, and encouraged a hostile environment. 
Your point about the word “idiot” is completely moot and illogical. The word’s meaning has been replaced, and it is no longer an offensive term. When people use the word “faggot,” it still means a derogatory term for a gay man. Until the meaning of the word “faggot” has been replaced by a more positive meaning in our lexicon, it will still be offensive. It’s not up to homophobic directors or television stars to decide when society will assimilate a new meaning for a term, thus excusing themselves from their own hate speech. 
It’s easy to say that words aren’t offensive when you’re not the one being offended by them. As a gay man, I’m incredibly offended by both Ratner and Morgan. Their words serve as painful reminders of the alienation and loneliness that I feel every day as someone who is part of a minority that is very often not accepted by society. As persons of cultural significance, their words have a certain resonance in society. They have affected millions of people with their words, rather than just the people within earshot, as is usually the case with hate speech, and they should be held fully accountable for promulgating the idea that hate speech is acceptable. 
I hope you learned something from this comment. As a writer with a platform, your words also have resonance. Please don’t use them to spread apathy or acceptance of discrimination and homophobia.
Before coming to USC, I worked in education, mostly middle school. Whenever I heard any of my students use “fag” (or “gay” or “retarded” or any other slur) to describe something they didn’t like, I used that as an immediate entry point into a discussion about how our words can be hurtful, even when we don’t intend them to be. It’s true, what Eddie Kim says, that the use of slurs is common among kids and teens, but it’s not true that it’s a sisyphean task. I saw a marked decrease in my students in their use of slurs, and I am just one of many, many educators across the country and worldwide who work with students to help them express themselves in more compassionate ways. I think that it’s noble and important work. I  think the advocate work done by individuals and organizations, such as GLAAD, is also important. By not allowing use of slurs in the media to go unnoticed, such advocacy work keeps these kids using the argument that since adults use it, it must be acceptable. If you’re not part of the solution, you’re part of the problem. And I think Eddie Kim’s argument–that it’s hard to fight slurs, so we might as well not even try–proves that he is certainly is not part of the solution.
Thank you.
I meant this as a reply to the previous post.

Tammy Lumpkins became the first patient on the West Coast to be discharged after receiving an artificial heart. She was operated upon at the USC Keck Hospital in late September and was finally released earlier this week.
Lumpkins, a 46-year-old mother of one, was admitted to the hospital in August. However, the long wait time for the transplant led to the need for an artificial as her health declined — her kidneys and liver began to fail and she became bed-ridden. Dr. Michael Bowdish, the Director of the hospital’s artificial heart program, later told the Los Angeles Times that the patient had been on the brink of death.
Prior to this case, patients with artificial hearts were required to stay hospitalized as they awaited heart transplants. This was so because the machines to make the devices work used to weigh 400 pounds. However, the new devices, manufactured by SynCardia, weigh only about 14 pounds and can be carried in a backpack.
Lumpkins will need to live near the hospital and undergo checkups every week. She told the Times, “I was ready to give up last summer. Now there’s a light at the end of the tunnel and it’s getting brighter.”
Good*
Tammy is my aunt and I’m sooo very happy that she is doing well she is walking proof of how Hood God really is I love you aunt Tammy!
I am so glad to hear Tammy is doing so good.  I have known her for about 5 yrs. and have seen her go through some of this.  So keep it up Tammy we are all praying for you.  Jane Henry MLMS Rock  club

Police released video footage and photographs this week of the mummified remains of 29 women on display in Anatoly Moskvin’s apartment. Authorities in Russia found the collection of women adorned in bright dresses and headscarves, with their faces and hands wrapped in cloth. The videos show the life-size dolls seated on shelves or sofas in small rooms, but no actual bones are apparent in the footage.
The 45-year-old Russian historian was considered the “ultimate expert on cemeteries” in his area according to The Telegraph. His arrest last week followed a long running investigation into the vandalization of several cemetery sites. The gravedigging crimes began in 2010 in Nizhny Novgorod, about 250 miles east of Moscow, but police could not track him down until recently.
Police did not say how he was arrested, but BBC said that Russian newspapers variously reported that Moskvin was caught with a bag of bones. The other version said that detectives grew suspicious when they consulted him, as a cemetery expert, about the grave destruction.
Authorities said that only women between 15 and 25 were selected by Moskvin for his collection, in which he stole the clothes from the graves with the bodies. According to CNN, police also found gravestone plaques, maps of local cemeteries and doll-making instructions in his apartment.
According to Fox News, Moskvin’s fascination with female corpses was apparently established when he was forced to kiss a dead girl at a funeral when he was 12 years old. Moskvin claimed that from 2005 to 2007 he had inspected 752 cemeteries across the region, often traveling about 20 miles a day by foot. According to BBC, he said he spent nights in haystacks or at abandoned farms, obtained water from puddles and had once even slept in a coffin readied for a funeral.
The historian faces charges punishable by up to three months in jail or a year of correctional labor for the desecration of dead bodies and their burial sites.

In many Asian countries, where good luck is considered paramount when choosing a wedding date, thousands of couples rushed to get married on 11/11/11. Symbolically, the date is considered to be one of the most auspicious in a century, prompting many couples to rush to the altar.
Because the date consists entirely of ones, in China it is heralded as “singles day,” prompting many couples to marry and “leave their single life behind.” Almost 5,000 couples tied the knot in Shanghai, and in a mass wedding in an eastern city called Jining, 68 couples wed simultaneously.
According to Yahoo News, a Hong Kong fen shui master and TV personality named Mak Ling Ling said, “It’s a good day from a Chinese geomancy perspective, not just because of the numbers 11/11/11 which signify eternal love.” She then went on to warn, “It’s a good start, definitely, but whether or not it will end up in divorce, it depends on how the couples maintain their marriage.”
In Singapore, the Registry of Marriage recorded five times the usual number of marriages. In addition, rumors swirled that Caesarian operations in Korea increased on the auspicious day in order to have children born on the lucky date, but officials were quick to deny those reports.
Wedding planners are expecting a deluge of weddings on another lucky date, Nov. 20; 20/11/2011 is an exact repetition of the numbers and perhaps even luckier than 11/11/11.
