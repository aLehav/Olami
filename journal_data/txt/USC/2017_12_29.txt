Three minutes into the Cotton Bowl, nothing was going right for the Trojans.
On the third snap, redshirt sophomore quarterback Sam Darnold had tossed a perfect pass to Deontay Burnett for 16 yards, only to watch the ball fly into the air and into Ohio State arms as the receiver crashed to the ground. In a minute and 12 seconds, quarterback J.T. Barrett marched his offense neatly into the end zone, walking one yard to score the first touchdown of the game.
It was a pattern the team continued throughout the game, as the Trojans’ offense continuously shot itself in the foot on the way to a 24-7 loss. Despite a lights out performance by the defense, the game descended into a bloodbath in the second quarter and grinded to its sullen conclusion as the Trojans fought back for too little, too late.
“The name of the game was turnovers,” head coach Clay Helton said. “We just didn’t finish today.”

The wheels came off in the second quarter, as Ohio State notched a field goal to take a 10-0 lead, then pinned the Trojans deep on the punt. Backed up into his own end zone, Darnold tried a quick fake — shifting his hips and head to the right, then pivoting back and throwing blind to his left — and instead threw the ball straight to a defender. He took off at a dead sprint, trying to cut off the defender, but it was long gone. The Buckeyes took a 17-0 lead, and the USC fans in the stands began to deflate.
It was an off-kilter and off-brand night for the USC offense. Junior running back Ronald Jones II, a Dallas native who entered the game charged to play in his hometown, only carried the ball 12 times for 42 yards on the half. While the offense leaned heavily on the passing game, Darnold threw 12-for-22, taking three sacks as he notched 170 yards. In eight drives, the offense didn’t make its way into the red zone once.
The defense stood as tall as possible throughout the first half. The unit held Ohio State to 237 yards, limiting Barrett to 71 passing yards. Rasheem Green and Uchenna Nwosu each notched a sack, while John Houston and Isaiah Langley led at the half with six tackles apiece.
“It doesn’t matter if our [offense] makes a mistake, we have to play calm,” Green said. “It doesn’t matter if the field’s short or the field’s long, we have to do our job.”
The pressure of holding down the line after two fumbles and a pick-six was a weight too heavy for the defense to bear. Barrett gashed the Trojans on the ground, sprinting for a 23 yard touchdown to put the Buckeyes up 24-0. Although the defense forced several three-and-outs, they were answered by rickety offensive drives that ended with the same dismal march of the kicking unit onto the field. Punter Reid Budrovich did little to help the Trojans, averaging under 35 yards per kick and sending one out of bounds for a penalty.
A rare bright spot came in the dwindling minutes of the second quarter, when K.J. Hill muffed a punt for Ohio State, sending the USC special teams unit scrambling. For a moment, it was almost a slap-stick scene, as the ball bounced and skittered across the grass, slipping out of the hands of several tumbling Trojans.

Marvell Tell finally flopped onto the ball on the 15-yard line, pounding it into the turf as he shouted in excitement, and the offense lined up in the red zone for the first time. The touchdown came easily, set up by a pass to Daniel Imatorbhebhe and clinched by a one-yard rush from Jones. With points on the board and the lead cut to 17 points, a small sense of hope seemed to inflate the student section in the final two minutes of the half.
That hope grew when the Trojans forced a three-and-out, headlined by a brutal sack by Green to drag Barrett back six yards. But a strong kick from Ohio State pinned the Trojans on their six-yard line to attempt a full-field drive in 59 seconds. Darnold botched a pass, and Helton elected to run the ball and the clock to finish the half.
The second half stood as a testament to the defense, which shut out the Buckeyes offense and held a team that averages over 500 yards a game to a measly 277. Linebacker Cameron Smith finished the night with 10 tackles, while Nwosu roped up Barrett again to finish with two sacks and four solo tackles.
“It was just it being our last game together,” Nwosu said. “As a team, as a brotherhood and as a family, we just had to fight together. No matter what the scoreboard says, play like it’s 0-0.”
But a lack of offensive killed any chance of a comeback, as Darnold and the Trojans continued to stall at midfield and fail to find the red zone. The offensive line struggle to hold the Ohio State defensive line, which consistently swarmed Darnold on blitzes, barely giving the quarterback time to scan the field before he took pressure. By the end of the night, Darnold took nine sacks.
“I told him in there in front of the team, I thought he was a warrior tonight,” Helton said. “To get off the ground that many times and make the plays that he did, he showed his true class and character.”
And even when the Trojans glimpsed the chance to score, it remained out of reach. In the fourth quarter, Chase McGrath’s field goal attempt ricocheted off the right post, sending the kicker to the ground as he grabbed his head in frustration. A pass interference call in the end zone gave Darnold another chance in the end zone, only for a blitzing lineman to swat the ball from his hand for yet another fumble.
“Whenever you turn over the ball that much, it’s hard to win games,” Darnold said. “It’s just the little things. There was a lot of stuff where we shot ourselves in our foot.”

The game ended, almost fittingly, with a fight. As Darnold scrambled towards the sideline on the team’s final drive, he took a hard hit out of bounds, resulting in a personal foul. But Aca’Cedric Ware flew at the defender with a push, and several Buckeyes followed.
Darnold held back one Ohio State player, but soon a scrum of players formed, shouting and shoving on the sidelines. Jamel Cook earned an ejection from the game for coming off the bench and taking a swing at another player before the two teams were dragged apart.
“Tempers are going to flare in that situation, especially when your quarterback’s over there,” Helton said. “There’s nobody that’s maybe more loved on this football team than Sam. And it was just in the heat of the game, both sides. Unfortunate, but it is what it is.”
The end of the game marked the end of a stumbling season for a team stocked with talent that fell just short of its expectations. It left many uncertainties for the team, headlined by the questions surrounding the fate of Darnold, who still insists that he hasn’t decided whether or not to declare for the NFL Draft.
But as the team trudged to the locker room, recording its second blowout loss in as many seasons on this field, one thing was certain — AT&T Stadium is not a good place to be a Trojan.

USC may not be in Pasadena, but the Cotton Bowl Classic smells like roses.
The No. 8 Trojans face off against No. 5 Ohio State Friday night in a showdown between the Pac-12 and Big Ten champions and a pair of 11-2 teams.
The matchup would traditionally be in Pasadena, Calif. if the Rose Bowl weren’t acting as a College Football Playoff semifinal this year. Instead, the two historical powerhouses will face off at 5:30 p.m. on Friday at a modern sporting jewel: AT&T Stadium in Arlington, Tex. — one of the most expensive arenas ever built, which can house north of 100,000 fans.
USC won’t be playing in the Rose Bowl this season. Last year, Deontay Burnett made this touchdown grab in a thrilling win in Pasadena – Katie Chin | Daily Trojan
It’s a fitting venue to showcase a new chapter of a rich rivalry. The Trojans and Buckeyes met in three consecutive Rose Bowls between 1973 and 1975 (seven total), and USC currently boasts a 13-9-1 mark over Friday’s opponent, including wins in its last seven tilts against the Buckeyes.
But a return to Jerry World presents another opportunity for the Trojans: a chance to erase the painful memory of the program’s first-ever visit to the stadium last year with raucous celebration.
“We all remember the feeling and know exactly how [the 52-6 loss to Alabama] felt — probably the worst loss a lot of us have taken,” junior linebacker Cam Smith said. “So it means something to us to be back here. It’s significant how far we’ve come.”
USC will have to show that progress against an Ohio State team with a wealth of experience and momentum. The pregame hype may center on the Trojans’ signal-caller, but Buckeye quarterback J.T. Barrett is a national champion and was starting for Urban Meyer’s squad when redshirt sophomore quarterback Sam Darnold was still in high school. And Barrett is in the midst of his best season yet, passing for a career-high 35 touchdowns with just nine interceptions — adding 732 yards and 10 touchdowns on the ground for good measure.
Barrett spearheads an Ohio State offense that averages 42.5 points per game (sixth in the nation). He goes to a wide variety of targets, with four receivers catching five or more scores this season (Parris Campbell and K.J. Hill lead the team in receiving yards but have caught just three touchdowns apiece). The air attack feeds off a 15th-ranked ground game. Freshman J.K. Dobbins has amassed 1,364 rushing yards and seven touchdowns on just 181 touches, good for 7.5 yards per carry— better than Jones’ 6.1 YPC clip for USC — and Mike Weber matches Barrett with 10 rushing scores this season.
“All-Americans all over the field,” senior linebacker Uchenna Nwosu said. “[Staying] assignment-sound and doing your job is going to be a key part of this game.”
The defense boasts formidable talent and depth as well, led by defensive end Nick Bosa, brother of former Ohio State standout Joey Bosa. The younger Bosa has proved himself as deadly a pass rusher as the current Los Angeles Chargers star, leading Ohio State with seven sacks.
“Without question, the most complete team we faced,” head coach Clay Helton said. “Extremely well-coached on both sides of the football. We’ll have our hands full Friday night.”
The Trojans were denied a spot in the playoff, so a Rose Bowl repeat isn’t in the cards this year — and neither is the national title run that many dreamed of leading into the season. But a win this weekend would feel nearly as good.
“We’re going to treat it as a playoff game,” junior running back Ronald Jones II said. “[The Buckeyes] are, too.”

Despite a campaign that perhaps felt defined by lowlights (two heartbreaking losses: a narrow defeat at Washington State and an embarrassing, 49-14 drubbing at Notre Dame) rather than highlights, the Trojans are primed to put the ribbon on a magnificent follow-up season to their thrilling 2016 — which began with the emergence of Darnold and ended with confetti in Pasadena. They are conference champions for the first time in nine years. USC won 10 games last year; the tally can rise to 12 this season with a victory against Ohio State.
“That’s special: A 12th win has only happened four times in 125 years for USC football,” Helton said. “It is our Super Bowl.”
And in their Super Bowl, the Trojans’ hopes will ride on a handful of men who could be playing their final games in cardinal and gold. Darnold is an elite NFL prospect, tossing 3,787 yards and 26 scores in the follow up to his breakout season. His overall numbers took a step back: Darnold’s 31:9 touchdown-to-interception ratio fell to 26:12 this year as he struggled with turnovers, but he also led impressive comebacks over Texas and Utah while steering USC to a Pac-12 title. There is a feeling that, when push comes to shove, Darnold will deliver.
“He did it last year in the Rose Bowl,” Nwosu said. “He’s done it all year and all last year and became a starter and took over. Sam is a great player. We believe in him. He has our full support.”
Jones will complement Darnold’s arm on the ground. He has found paydirt 18 times this year and rides a five-game streak of rushing for at least 100 yards and one touchdown. Captains Nwosu, Smith and redshirt senior safety Chris Hawkins will lead the way defensively. The Trojans have been prone to giving up the big play this season, and in order to contain the high-powered Buckeye offense, the captains are emphasizing playing as a unit.
“It’s really important for us to play with great eyes on this game and be disciplined and play as a defense, not as an individual,” Smith said. “And over the last ten games or so, we’ve become more sound and playing as a unit and less going out and trying to make plays.”

Darnold, Jones and Smith are juniors, but with the NFL Draft calling their names (and for Darnold, possibly first overall), the trio could very well opt to leave school early. With the deadline to declare still weeks away, though, the players remained focused squarely on the Buckeyes, despite being bombarded with questions about their professional futures.
“I haven’t been thinking about [the draft] a ton,” Darnold said. “I’ve been really focused on Ohio State.”
Nevertheless, the potential top pick admitted he was excited for what lies ahead of the Cotton Bowl. And he trusts his own judgment, just as he does on the field.
“Honestly, yeah — [going No. 1] would be awesome,” Darnold said. “Life is kind of moving really fast right now. So I’ve made some big decisions, and coming to USC was one of them. And it was a really great decision.”
But for now, the next big decision can wait. With one more victory on Friday, everything may just come up roses on its own.
