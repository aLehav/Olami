If you know me, you’d know I’ve been involved in the Democratic party for a little while now. I would be lying if I said I enjoyed my time in all of those experiences and opportunities. I’d like to think that I assume the best from people, or in this case, the party. Just as I believe in a better South, I believe in a better Democratic party with a big enough tent to cover folks from all walks of life. Nearly every single experience I’ve had in Democratic politics has torpedoed my previously abundant sense of optimism and left me feeling fed up and disillusioned with the party that I thought could get things done. Watching the Missouri Senate race during this summer didn’t do any good with my sense of optimism either.
The loss of Lucas Kunce, a Democratic candidate and self-described populist, in his primary for a Missouri Senate seat, was incredibly disappointing. To describe oneself as a populist is a bold move for someone running for political office in this current environment as it involves an anti-establishment ideology which is much less common in Missouri. But beyond his own labels, Kunce’s messaging tactics and political branding are the most compelling ones I’ve seen from any progressive currently running in the South. And that says a lot.
He’s a former Marine and a veteran that’s been vocal about how the U.S. government lied to people to line the pockets of military defense contractors. He’s a Yale alumnus that managed to get by thanks to grants and financial aid. And he’s a Southerner with just enough gall to hit back at some of the name-calling and belittling that Republicans have heaped on Democrats for decades. What’s more, he got the official Bernie endorsement.
His story, stump speech, platform and general appeal make him appear the ideal candidate to reach Missourians from all across the political spectrum. He’s meeting Missourians where they’re at and talking to them about the kitchen table issues that matter to them. He put in the work, it seems. So why is it that he lost his primary? Doesn’t that fact alone render my belief that progressives can win in the South an outlandish and unsubstantiated one?
The two biggest kingmakers in politics are the money and the message. Organization is also critically important, but I think I’ve already made it pretty clear in previous pieces I’ve penned that I don’t have a lot of hope for the organizing skills of the Democratic party, so I won’t direct the focus of this entry there. Kunce has great messaging, and it helped him build a tent that Missourians from across the political spectrum could find themselves under. Of course, that’s only for Missourians who managed to find Lucas Kunce and hear his message.
In politics, money is equally as important, if not the make or break factor in campaigns. Money helps campaigns and candidates communicate, which is incredibly important in a world that’s moving at lightspeed towards the digital age. Cash buys ads, flyers and space on the radio waves. Without a way to communicate your message to the folks who you want to get to vote for you, you’re essentially a political nobody. A campaign and candidate’s message is only as good as the method in which it is delivered. In the case of who’s got more cash, Kunce’s small-dollar grassroots base just couldn’t pull him ahead of a multi-millionaire. Sure, Kunce managed to raise a hefty sum of $4.7 million during his run, putting him over the $3.4 million that his primary opponent Trudy Busch Valentine raised, but Valentine also injected a hefty $3 million into her own campaign thanks to her robust net worth.
All of this is slightly disappointing when you consider that the Senate Democrat’s campaign arm, the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee (DSCC), raised over $33.5 million in donations from April to June, largely thanks to the outpouring of emotional giving after the Dobbs decision — outraising their Republican counterparts. I’d like to think that Democratic donors are pitching in because they believe that Democrats can meet the moment and work to deliver on the promises they keep making. By failing to throw their sizable weight and resources behind Kunce, and candidates like him, the Democratic party has just missed another opportunity to do right by folks who want to see those promises kept.

The June release of the newest USC financial report revealed varying statistics about University finances, with tuition prices rising and the coronavirus pandemic affecting revenue streams. 
For the University’s 21,000 undergraduate students, the price of tuition increased by 2.1 percent, resulting in an annual cost of attendance of $79,063. Of those who were in the 2020 entering class, 21% received a merit-based USC scholarship, and two-thirds received some form of financial assistance. 
Jessica Bukowski, a sophomore majoring in communication, said that she was “amazed” to see the high-priced tuition rise each year with how few freshmen were receiving merit scholarships compared with how many were receiving assistance.
“[For] a school that’s as competitive as USC to get into already, I feel like 21% is still a very low number considering how many of these students are very academically high achieving,” Bukowski said. “I think it’s crazy how a lot of these students, even with getting these merit scholarships to help tuition, still have to seek other aid … You shouldn’t have to pay that much for an education.”
James Nguyen, a sophomore studying cognitive science and English, said that the increasing price of tuition was difficult to deal with, even with picking up multiple jobs during the summer to support the cost.
“I’m not shy to say that I’m in need of financial aid … so [the school] increasing it even more really hurts me,” said Nguyen.
According to the University’s comptroller Erik Brink this overall cost of attendance comprises four major parts: tuition and fees, room and board, miscellaneous expenses and books. The increase in price reflects updates in financial aid packaging, as well as compensates for the latest averages of housing in the local Los Angeles area. 
“Not every student lives in a University housing facility, so [the financial aid office] tried to factor in what that cost is in our community,” said Brink.
The school additionally plans to maintain its need-blind admissions policy for future USC admits.
Another significant factor at play within the unique financial statistics from this year’s report is the effect of the coronavirus pandemic on revenues, general campus maintenance and spending on physical capital. Auxiliary revenue, including revenue from the USC Village, Athletics, and events held at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum decreased by 80 percent. Other revenue from USC Ticket Office sales, the USC radio group and Marshall business decreased by 29 percent. Meanwhile, health care services revenue increased by 11.4 percent — and clocks in as the largest revenue stream for the university. 
“All of that was impacted really significantly by the lack of us being on campus,” said Brink. “We hope to, over the next year, get back to that level that we were at before.”
Additionally, USC received a total of 103 million dollars in federal COVID relief funding due to the passage of the CARES Act, which provides higher education grant funds to support universities during the pandemic. 56 million dollars was given directly to students through aid packages, while the remaining funds were used to support the University during the period of time when students were off campus and out of dorms.
The net assets of the USC endowment now total 8.126 billion dollars — a 37 percent increase from the previous year; investments in the school’s endowment, including venture capital programs, returned at a high percentage of 43.2 percent.
University contributions and gifts also rose at around 17 percent (a total of $524 million) in the 2021 fiscal year, but this was due to the timing of recognition of new construction plans.
“We have a really good track record of keeping a stable gift program coming in. For fiscal year ‘21, there was some recognition of some gifts relative to some construction projects that just happened to come through during that year, and so gave it a little extra increase,” Brink said. 
Brink expects the next fiscal year’s report to be published around late spring.

Over its two-decade history, through countless tailgates and events, McCarthy Quad has never been more alive than it was last weekend. On Saturday, new and returning students enjoyed one of USC’s most beloved Welcome Week festivities: the Welcome Back Concert.
Just like last year’s event, Saturday’s concert, put on by the Concerts Committee, saw students flock to McCarthy Quad to enjoy food trucks, cute photo opportunities and three free concerts. Though it was only the second in-person Welcome Back Concert since the coronavirus pandemic canceled the 2020 show, the turnout was remarkable, with late-comers being turned away as the concert reached capacity later in the night.
This year’s lineup featured three high-profile names for USC students to enjoy free of charge —  melodic screamo rapper JELEEL! and singer-turned-hyperpop DJ Rebecca Black were the two openers for this year’s show, with rapper Flo Milli headlining. 
The lines weaving toward McCarthy Quad’s temporary entrance were long, with students winding between Waite Phillips Hall and the Social Sciences Building and even spilling out onto Trousdale Parkway. Starting at 6:30 p.m., senior Matt Garfinkel, also known as dj daily double, kicked off the concert with a set which had the crowd buzzing. A member of the Concert Committee’s E-Board, daily double’s set lasted about an hour, with fellow USC student and rapper Sumit making a brief cameo appearance to the applause of a solid block of diehard fans to stage left.
JELEEL! opened the Welcome Back Concert as the first guest, starting the night off with unparalleled energy. The Los Angeles native has been on a quick rise to fame in the last year and a half after his endlessly shoutable track “DIVE IN!” went viral online. He’s since utilized his powerful voice and energetic, gymnastic performances on social media apps like TikTok and Instagram to further propel his success. 
He made quite the entrance, ripping his shirt off and showcasing acrobatic stunts to get the crowd going. At the beginning of his performance, JELEEL! performed one of his signature backflips, which ended up unplugging a speaker. 
“That gave me a heart attack because I heard the audio go out, and I’m like, ‘Holy crap, man, what did I do?,’ so then I ran to the side of the stage and the guys running the sound booth were like, ‘Don’t worry, all he did was unplug something with the backflip.’ I was like thank God because that freaked me out, but that was really funny” said Concerts Committee director of production Connor Christ.
JELEEL!’s high-energy performance was infectious, as the crowd raved to songs like “UNCIVILIZED! (GO!),” “JULY!” and his hit song “DIVE IN!” Unfortunately — or perhaps thankfully — he wasn’t able to dive into the crowd for the safety of our Trojans, but he marched on with his trademark ‘raw energy’ performance — and a wealth of backflips. The crowd moshed throughout his entire set, around 20-30 minutes of high-octane fun.
To fill the gaps between the featured artists’ sets, the Concerts Committee created and hosted Kahoot quizzes, open to the entire audience to join and featuring trivia questions about USC, the artist lineup and entertaining quips. “What’s the name of USC’s safety school?” read one, with all four answers marked “UCLA” (and all four deemed correct).
After a brief break for the crew to set the stage, Rebecca Black went on for a DJ set, a choice that many only familiar with her biggest work didn’t expect. Black, the singer who released the infamously disdained single “Friday” in 2011 when she was 13, has since evolved into a multi-talented artist and exciting performer despite the considerable online hate she faced early in her career.
Since collaborating with Dorian Electra in 2020 and releasing a hyperpop remix of “Friday” produced by Dylan Brady of 100 Gecs and featuring 3OH!3, Big Freedia and Dorian Electra to commemorate its tenth anniversary in 2021, Black has adopted more and more of a hyperpop sound, complimenting her vocal energy and playful songwriting with the brash and futuristic production elements of her contemporaries.
Not only did Black curate a fun, bouncy vibe for the middle of the concert, she brought along some friends to turn the three-artist lineup into a practically six-part festival. Kept secret before the event, her entourage turned out to be a trifecta of rapper Reí Ami, self-described screamo queen Lil Mariko and modern-age pop star Slayyyter, with whom Black has recently collaborated on new singles.
All three guests brought immense energy to their performances, and though a technical snafu prompted Lil Mariko to restart her song “Hi, I’m a Slut” over again after the first chorus, it only prompted the crowd to sing along louder. Between each appearance, Black and her DJ collaborator danced around, flicked switches on their controllers and flung T-shirts into the crowd.
In turn, the crowd reciprocated their energy. Initially hesitant about Black’s DJ set, the crowd was soon bouncing along with her to the most danceable beats of the night. So too did the Rebecca Black purists among the crowd speak out; throughout the set, chants of “Friday! Friday!” often overwhelmed the music. Black, at first only giggling at the chants, eventually took the mic to reassure the crowd that “later … we definitely won’t forget about that one.”
While it was true that Black didn’t forget about her seminal classic, concertgoers may have been let down by her choice to perform the aforementioned hyperpop remix instead of the nostalgic 2011 version. Still, the crowd gleefully sang along to the track’s lyrics, celebrating their final weekend before the start of fall classes.
Following Black’s performance was another Kahoot, and along with it a break for students to talk, peruse the food trucks and wring out their sweat-soaked tees. “Oohing” and “ahhing” with every question, the games were a joyful way to bring the audience together and maintain a crowd during the concert’s downtime. Still, the headliner ensured that nobody would be leaving early.
Flo Milli, a twice-gold rapper from Mobile, Ala., rocked McCarthy Quad for the rest of the night. Performing hits for new and old listeners alike, Milli made an impression on the Trojan community with her high-confidence and rapid-fire wordplay, much to the delight of fans.
“Flo Milli was [my favorite], for sure,” said Madison Brown, a junior majoring in data science. “[The Committee] definitely did a good job. There’s a lot of energy and a lot of people here.”
In short, Flo Milli had a million flows. From high energy hits off her debut mixtape, “Ho, why is you here ?,” like “In the Party” and “Beef FloMix,” to newer bangers like “Conceited” or “Big Steppa,” and even bonus tracks like “Roaring 20s,” Milli kept the energy rolling all night.
The sustained excitement from Milli must have worked to retain the crowd, because it seemed to only grow as the night went on. Still, as some shared on social media, at some point it seemed students were turned away at the gate as the event reached capacity, despite observations that people were leaving.
“They aren’t letting anyone in bc they’re at capacity but people were leaving the whole time??? Make it make it (sic) sense,” commented @jamiethegemini_ on the uscconcerts Instagram page.
Inside the event, Milli gave fans no reason to leave early, strutting around the stage as she spat with trademark poise and power. In the spirit of connecting with the student body, her performance featured students as backup dancers, vogueing and clapping to her beats. She even took a jump off stage into the pit to get closer to the fans, singing along to her lyrics with the lucky few at the front.
In the midst of her performance, Milli took a pause to take out her camera and record a selfie video with the crowd, encouraging them to join in with her on a trademark “Flo Milli shit, ho!” Even long into the night, after four hours of bouncing around on a warm L.A. night, the crowd was completely with her to the last bar.
After a final song, Milli left the stage and the crowd began to trickle out, still humming snippets of the shows they saw. In speaking with student attendees and surveying the comments across the concert committee’s social media platforms, what stands out is a general satisfaction with the excitement around and diversity of the selections.
“I feel like it was definitely some very talented artists that brought good energy so far from what I’ve seen,” said Henri Manu Effa Fouda, a sophomore studying business administration. “I think that it attracts a diverse crowd, and that’s all you can ask for.”

Women’s soccer kicked off the 2022 season Thursday when they traveled to Indiana to take on Purdue University. Despite a hard fought 90 minutes, the No. 15 Trojans struggled to execute on the offensive end and ultimately lost 3-0 to the unranked Boilermakers.
Sunday’s game against Long Beach State fared better for the Trojans, earning a 1-0 victory. 
In West Lafayette, the Trojans started hot, outshooting Purdue 11-4 in the first half, forcing goalie Sara Kile to make three first half saves. 
“I thought we came out strong,” Head Coach Jane Alukonis said in an interview with the Daily Trojan. “We had chances in the beginning, and I thought momentum was swinging our way for a while.” 
However, led by their underclassmen attack, the Boilermakers were able to sneak in a goal in the 43rd minute of the game, stealing the lead as the teams entered halftime before widening their lead in the second half.
“Giving up a goal right before halftime was really tough, and then Purdue just kept gaining momentum,” Alukonis said. “Purdue does a good job of just getting numbers in and making it super compact in there and putting people in the way of goal.”
Despite outshooting Purdue 17-11 over the course of the game, the Trojans were unable to take advantage of their shots and turn them into goals. 
“Early on, we were a bit ambitious, taking some long-range shots, shots that don’t have a high likelihood of going in,” Alukonis said. “Certainly combining together and getting closer to goal, a lot of that just comes from playing together and using each other to solve problems.”
Part of the Trojans’ difficulties communicating can be attributed to the absence of four starting players, who were all away in Costa Rica playing for their national teams in the U-20 World Cup. Sophomore defender Brooklyn Courtnall, junior defense and midfielder Zoe Burns and sophomore midfielder Simi Awujo play for Team Canada, while sophomore forward Simone Jackson was tapped for Team USA, scoring the lone goal in the team’s 3-1 loss to Japan on August 17.
“[Missing starters] gives players game time to prove themselves and to gain the experience and get the minutes,” Alukonis said. “We always want to support any international opportunities that our players get, but for sure we are all happy to have them back very soon.”
With the return of their starters, the Trojans are looking forward to their coming games and to the looming start of Pac-12 conference play. 
“We’ve been preaching extremely hard work on both sides of the ball,” Alukonis said. “SC has always been known for amazing attack, and sometimes we feel like spaces between us, or the pressure that we put on the ball, is not quite where we want it to be.”
Despite the work still to be done, the Trojans are more motivated than ever to take on the coming games. 
“As Trojans, we always believe we are going to go out and win the game and put in the hardest fight we possibly can,” Alukonis said. “We are looking forward to Sunday. We are glad we don’t have to wait super long to redeem ourselves.”
Redemption came swiftly for the Trojans when the team traveled to Long Beach Sunday night. An early goal by sophomore midfielder Aaliyah Farmer lifted the Trojans over the Beach. 
Senior midfielder Croix Bethune, who was named the top player in the country by TopDrawerSoccer.com, assisted Farmer on a corner kick. Joining Bethune on the list of top college soccer players is graduate defender Brandi Peterson, who came in at number 11 in the country.
After scoring the first and only goal in the seventh minute, the Trojan offense was able to keep pressure up into and through the second half, with 10 of their 17 shots coming after halftime. Maintaining pressure was something that the Trojans were looking to work on following the loss to Purdue, in which they shot 11 shots in the first half and only six in the second. 
“Continuing to go as much as we can and putting the pressure on them, rather than letting them come at us [is the key to maintaining momentum],” said Alukonis following the loss to Purdue on Thursday.
However, it was the Trojan defense that carried them to victory over the Beach, allowing only one shot in the first half and seven in the second, with only two shots on goal throughout all 90 minutes. USC was aided by the return of Burns from team Canada, who logged two shots and one on goal on top of her stellar defense. Also returning to the team was fellow team Canada member Awujo, who logged one shot in her 76 minutes. 
The Trojans were led by 90-minute performances by four of their starters, including Farmer, Bethune, senior defender Kaylin Martin and Peterson, as well as senior goalkeeper Anna Smith. 
Following their victory over the Beach, the Trojans look to extend their hot streak in their home opener against Texas Christian University at Soni McAlister field Sept. 1 at 3 p.m.

It’s also time for USC’s busy fall athletic calendar to begin — in fact, it already has. The soccer team is already two games into their season. Volleyball plays their season opener on Friday. Football, cross country and men’s water polo open their seasons next weekend. 
USC will field 21 Division 1 athletic teams this school year as the 629 student athletes at USC navigate their athletic, academic and extracurricular commitments. 
A typical weekday for a USC football player consists of weightlifting in the mornings followed by a day of classes, tutoring sessions and studying. In the evenings the team practices, reviews game film and has team meetings. Their schedule becomes even more packed once teams start traveling to away games. 
When asked about the first day of classes, redshirt senior lineman Brett Neilon let out a big sigh and said, “To be honest I’ve been here a long time, doing a lot of classes, so I’m not too excited but you know what? I have two [classes] left to get my master’s degree so I’m excited about that.” 
Neilon is studying for his master’s degree in entrepreneurship and innovation. 
USC’s future departure to the Big Ten and its embrace of name, image and likeness deals caused many people, such as Pac-12 commissioner George Kliavkoff, to question the University’s commitment to the education of its athletes. 
“It’s clear that UCLA and USC made a decision for short-term financial gain at the expense of their student-athletes,” Kliavkoff said in an interview with the Athletic. 
University of California leadership is attempting to prevent UCLA’s move to the Big Ten in part because of the large increase in time commitment for athletes. USC, being a private institution, is free from any UC control. 
USC emphasized the importance of education in their initial Big Ten announcement, even as the average USC athlete’s schedule is set to become much busier with the increased time spent traveling across the country.
“The enhanced resources from this move will enable additional support for our student-athletes as well as benefit initiatives surrounding academics, accessibility and affordability,” said President Carol Folt in the University’s initial announcement of the groundbreaking move. “We are committed to devoting the necessary resources to ensure our student-athletes can continue to thrive in their coursework with minimal travel disruption.”
Despite the headache that planning a USC athlete’s schedule could become, there is little question on how dedicated athletes are to their craft and whatever it takes to stay on the playing field or in the classroom. 
“Every day, whatever’s expected of me, I’m going to be there, whether it’s for classes or football.” redshirt sophomore lineman Courtland Ford said.  
For some athletes, the resources provided by the University help ease the process. 
“I think with water polo we organize it pretty well,” said water polo captain Chris Sturtevant in an interview with the Daily Trojan. “All of our freshmen have mandatory tutors and if varsity athletes want we can talk to our athletic advisor and she’ll give us whatever tutor we want for the class.”
Cole Gabrielson, an outfielder for the baseball team, said that the busy schedules are just a part of being a college athlete. 
“It’s hard work but it’s what you signed up for when you decided to come play college athletics,” Gabrielson said. “Obviously the early mornings into a long day with practice late into the night can get tiring but that’s the separator right there of good teams and bad teams.
