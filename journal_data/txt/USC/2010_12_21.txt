In 2010, USC spent the season with a depleted roster, well below the allotted number of scholarship players, but Tuesday, coach Lane Kiffin took a step toward filling the depth chart, signing three players who will enroll in the spring. Offensive lineman Jeremy Galten (San Mateo, Calif.), linebacker Dallas Kelley (Rancho Cucamonga, Calif.) and long snapper Peter McBride (Paradise Valley, Ariz.) will count against the 2010 recruiting class and leave more available scholarships for the 2011 class.
The three commits address serious needs for the Trojans, as Kiffin has admitted that he does not know how his team would line up at linebacker with starters Malcom Smith and Michael Morgan graduating. Dallas Kelley, who led Chaffey Junior College in tackling and was subsequently named to the All-Central West Conference first team, is expected to  compete for a starting spot immediately.
Additionally, Kiffin beefed up the depth on the offensive line. With offensive tackle Tyron Smith leaving early for the NFL and center Kristofer O’Dowd graduating, Jeremy Galten, a two-time All-NorCal Conference first team pick, will likely compete with Michael Reardon for the job of protecting Matt Barkley.
To date, nine players have signed letters of intent to enroll at USC in the spring.
[…] Trojans were well below the scholarship limit in 2010, and Lane Kiffin has tried to fill in the roster by adding spring commitments to count against the 2010 …. With the three commitments today, USC has signed nine players in total for the spring semester. […]

“I was thinking, not again,” said USC junior forward Alex Stepheson.
A game-winning 3-pointer from a young freshman – a former McDonald’s High School All-American. Saturday afternoon, Kansas’ guard Josh Selby drained the winning bucket against USC with 26 seconds remaining.
On Tuesday, it was Tennessee forward Tobias Harris with the ball in his hands trying to hand USC (7-5) back-to-back heart-breaking losses on the road.

The No. 18 Volunteers (7-3) inbounded the ball to Harris from midcourt with 3.5 seconds remaining. USC’s top defender, Marcus Simmons, didn’t bite on a flare screen and Harris was forced to catch the ball near halfcourt.
Harris took two dribbles to his right. Simmons sprawled onto the floor in front of Harris as the freshman launched a shot five feet from behind the three-point line. The red lights lit up around the edge of the backboard. The final horn sounded.
“It was straight. It was real straight,” Stepheson said.
“A lot of things went through my head. It was like watching a movie,” USC guard Jio Fontan said. “It was in slow mo[tion]. I saw a freshman. I saw the ball have enough air on it.”
The shot was perfectly on line. It was going to crush the Trojans’ “Fight On” will, send them plummeting to a .500 record and potentially end their NCAA Tournament at-large hopes before conference play even began.
Instead, when Simmons looked up from the court, he saw the ball bounding back toward him. Maurice Jones grabbed the basketball that had clanked off the back rim. USC celebrated an impressive 65-64 road victory at Thompson-Boling Arena in Knoxville, Tenn.
“It was just a big sigh of relief. I was ready to take off my jersey and go crazy,” said Fontan, who finished with 13 points, four assists, and three steals despite being in foul trouble for much of the game. “But I just had to smile and get out of there with a ‘W.’”
In a back-and-forth contest, surprisingly, it was USC’s outside shooting that carried them. The Trojans knocked down 43 percent of their 3-point attempts. Maurice and Bryce Jones made three each.
Four players, including the Joneses, scored in double figures. But for only the third time this season, leading scorer Nikola Vucevic did not.
Vucevic was shut down by Tennessee’s interior defense and foul trouble. He only scored four points and grabbed one rebound before fouling out after playing only 24 minutes.
Without Vucevic for much of the game, coach Kevin O’Neill went to a smaller four-guard lineup often featuring the combo of Maurice Jones, Donte Smith and Fontan – none taller than six foot.
“We have no choices. This investigation devastated our team. We have eight guys that we play,” O’Neill said. “We had to play small. We said ‘Hey, we’re stuck doing it so let’s go.’”
Maurice Jones scored a game-high 15 points and added four rebounds, four assists and four steals. Bryce Jones scored in double-figures for the first time in three weeks, while Stepheson quietly had another solid performance, scoring 13 points and snatching seven rebounds while playing 39 minutes.
For Tennessee, Harris led the way with 14 points. But leading-scorer Scotty Hobson struggled for the third consecutive game – three Volunteer losses. He shot only 1-of-5 from the floor and committed six of Tennessee’s 18 turnovers.
USC will return home to face its third consecutive opponent that made last year’s NCAA Tournament. They will take on Lehigh at 5:30 p.m. PST in a game O’Neill believes could be tougher than bouncing back after the tough loss to Kansas.
“We had lost two close games already. We don’t have a lot of wiggle room if we want to do anything. We needed to get a road win and getting one over a ranked team is really important. I’m more worried about a letdown two days from now when we play at home.”
That’s right! That’s the Trojan resiliency, fight on! It’s not always football that steals the spotlight.

The university will no longer hold classes on the Wednesday before Thanksgiving, according to a recent memo from Elizabeth Garrett, the provost and senior vice president for academic affairs.
“USC is a truly international university with undergraduate and graduate students from across the country and around the world,” Garrett wrote in the memo to university administrators and student leaders. “The Thanksgiving holiday provides an important break in the fall semester for students to relax with friends and family before final exams and the completion of projects.”
Although the Academic Calendar Committee did not recommend making this change for the 2011-2012 academic calendar, Garrett still directed the registrar to include Wednesday, November 23, 2011 in the Thanksgiving break. The school will remain open, however, and Wednesday will not be considered a staff holiday.
Garrett’s memo cautions deans and faculty to be “rigorous” about holding classes on Monday and Tuesday before Thanksgiving, saying that it is “important that [the university] maintain the very highest academic standards.”
