In honor of the 10th anniversary of krump, an energetic street-style dance with African roots that originated in Los Angeles, USC Visions and Voices hosted a conversation in Annenberg 207 on Tuesday with Marquisa Gardner, known by her stage name Miss Prissy, fellow dancer Lil’ C and journalist Jessica Koslow.

Gardner has been involved with the dance since its origin. She, Lil’ C and other dancers in their crew began with clown dancing, an early form of krumping. Gardner said that krump evolved from a desire to blend clown dancing with traditional dance forms.
“It’s a combination of street dance elements and African dance,” Gardner said. “We’re still moving somewhat clown-like; we’re also channeling our ancestors.”
The dance movement was picked up when artist and photographer David LaChapelle saw  Lil’ C krumping on MTV. Gardner was featured in a documentary Rize, which explores the development of this dance style. In the film, Gardner is referred to as the “queen of krump.”
Last year, Koslow, a graduate student studying specialized journalism in the arts, approached Gardner to film her own documentary after attending a class on krump that Gardner taught. Koslow said she explained her interest in writing her thesis about krumping to Gardner.
Koslow shot a 15-minute documentary that was published by KCET, the local public broadcasting station. But the story did not end there: Koslow discussed the possibility of creating a show at USC with Gardner.
The finished project, “The Underground: From the Streets to the Stage,” was performed at USC last Wednesday.
The project is just one example of krumping’s growing popularity. According to Gardner, people have started to gather for krumping sessions in a North Hollywood parking lot every Wednesday at midnight.
That setting is perhaps the right one for Gardner, who believes that having the sessions outside is important for the spirit of krump because the style’s origins come from the street.
Though the dance might look confusing to outsiders, Gardner said the dance is about expressing and accepting oneself.
“People think it’s such an angry dance, but it’s just really emotional — fighting for respect, fighting to be noticed,”  Gardner said.
Lacey Schauwecker, a third year Ph.D. candidate studying comparative literature, said she attended the event after seeing the krump performance last week.
“I loved the energy of it,” Schauwecker said. “It felt so alive. I’m familiar with the form of dance, and I came today because I wanted to learn more about it.”
A krump dance workshop will be held by Lil’ C and Miss Prissy at the North Gym in the Physical Education Building on Wednesday at 5 p.m.

With the United States presidential election only 55 days away, both President Barack Obama and Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney have ramped up their campaigns in an attempt to win over voters from as many demographics as possible.

Young voters are a key demographic that both campaigns have worked to win over, and student groups on college campuses are a key part of that effort.
Leaders of USC Trojans for Romney and Trojans for Obama said their groups are committed to serving their respective candidates and seeking to win over as many student voters as possible.
Alex Yebri, the president of USC Trojans for Romney and a senior majoring in political science, said his group is working to increase involvement on campus.
“USC Trojans for Romney is working tirelessly to lend enthusiastic conservative and independent college students the chance to engage in one of the most important elections of our generation,” said Yebri. “Most importantly, we are working to bring political awareness to the student body at a time when college students feel the pain of high unemployment, trillion dollar deficits and broken promises.”
Both groups plan to achieve greater student engagement through a series of events. During the national conventions, for example, the two groups helped sponsor screenings of the respective presidential acceptance speeches.
“We will also co-host screenings of the presidential and vice presidential debates with the Unruh Institute of Politics, after which our members will have an opportunity to speak on panels to provide analysis on the state of the campaigns,” said Kaya Masler, president of Trojans for Obama.
The two groups work closely with the Jesse M. Unruh Institute of Politics, helping it plan and promote programs like “The Road to the White House,” a series of panels leading up to the election focusing on different political issues each week. The panels take place every Wednesday at noon in either the Ronald Tutor Campus Center Forum or the Rosen Family Screening Theatre. Dan Schnur, director of the Unruh Institute, said the panels are meant to provide students with analysis.
“In a world that’s dominated by Fox and MSNBC, it’s very easy to only listen to those people who you already agree with,” Schnur said. “We put together these panel discussions to give students and faculty an opportunity to hear a wide range of voices across the political spectrum.”
Schnur also emphasized the importance of breaking students out of a passive mindset.
“We believe strongly in the principle of student participation, not just as audience members, but as panelists,” Schnur said. “We believe that it’s important for students to be part of the conversation.”
In addition to the campaigning on campus, both USC Trojans for Romney and Trojans for Obama plan to travel to Nevada, a key battleground state.
“We will be traveling to Las Vegas, Nevada twice in October to register voters and persuade key voters in the swing state,” Masler said.
According to Yebri and Masler, both groups will be involved in registering voters and making phone calls to potential voters.
“In the weeks leading up to the election, Trojans For Romney will be active in registering voters,” Yebri said. “Our organization will also be holding call nights.”
Additionally, Trojans for Obama plan to up the number of phone calls they make to potential voters.
“Last semester our organization made over 3,000 calls for the Obama campaign,” Masler said. “We have upped our goal to 5,000 for this semester and hope to register as many new and old voters, on and off campus, as possible.”
Yebri stressed the importance of this election for students and said their groups provide a forum for students to participate in discussion about the election.
“We are facing an election that mirrors that of 1980,” Yebri said. “People are struggling as unemployment has been over 8 percent for 43 months, wages have dropped and half of college graduates can’t find work,” Yebri said. “Trojans For Romney is a venue for students to speak their mind about the future of this country and provides students an opportunity to make a difference.”

The Undergraduate Student Government Senate voted unanimously to change the title of student committee members to student “delegates” at its meeting Tuesday evening. This will be the first time in USG’s history that student committee members will have official titles and defined roles.
Government · USG Senators Jasmine McAllister, left, Sona Shah, and Sarah Loh debate a proposed change to the organization’s bylaws. – Priyanka Patel | Daily Trojan
The amendment does not add any new positions to student government.
The title change came as a result of consistent internal complaints by committee members in USG, who felt they were not given a significant enough role in the organization.
Hassaan Ebrahim, a sophomore majoring in neuroscience, was a member of the University Affairs Committee and joined USG last year to contribute to the university’s student body.
“I didn’t feel actively involved enough,” said Ebrahim, who is now the assistant director of USG’s elections and recruitment. “Honestly, a lot of responsibilities weren’t given to members on committees. We were more used as idea givers and were sometimes asked for our opinions.”
The USG administration also wanted to bridge the gap in its organization with this bylaw change. The USG directors of election and recruitment committee, along with the directors of the five other advocacy groups in student government, brainstormed a solution to this problem, which resulted in the bylaw change.
Violetta Abi Naked, the co-director of elections and recruitment for USG and a senior majoring in international relations, agreed that the lack of student involvement at the committee level needed to be addressed.
“Not feeling involved is the last thing we wanted our committee members to feel,” Abi Naked said. “If they don’t feel like they’re a part of us, we’re obviously not doing something right.”
Roughly 400 delegates, distributed among the six committees in USG, will now be responsible for research-based tasks and outreach to their peers on campus. They will also have more opportunities for one-on-one meetings with their directors, in which they will be able to pitch more suggestions for events or changes to be implemented on campus.
The leaders of USG believe the improved title will better encourage the delegates and thereby benefit the organization as a whole.
“We hope that the delegates really rally behind the name change and that this will motivate them to do bigger and better work,” said USG President Mikey Geragos, a senior majoring in public policy, management and planning. “A lot of the projects that we do in student government stem from their research work.”
The change in name for students on USG committees goes into effect immediately. Directors of the committees, which sometimes have as many as 80 delegates each, are responsible for notifying their members of the change in name and responsibility.
USG’s goal is to provide students with meaningful experiences at USC through advocacy, funding opportunities and programming events. Abi Naked said that the increase in delegate involvement as a result of the title change will help USG further achieve their goals.
USG is still in the process of selecting its delegates for the upcoming school year. The directors hope the delegates appreciate the changes that their revised title will bring.
“One of the most important things about being in an organization is that you as an individual are making a difference in it,” Abi Naked said. “Everyone wants to make a difference and see change happen because of something that they did. I believe that students feeling more involved and more relevant in USG will see it as a positive change.”

Short-term fasting improved the effectiveness of radiation therapy in and expanded the life expectancy of mice with aggressive brain tumors, according to a study published by USC researchers Tuesday.
This is the first study to show that fasting affects the treatment of cancer cells with radiation treatment. The study’s co-author Valter Longo, professor of gerontology and biological sciences and director of the Longevity Institute at the USC Davis School of Gerontology, previously conducted research on chemotherapy treatment and reported similar findings.
Researchers studied the treatment of mice infected with glioma, the most commonly diagnosed and one of the most aggressive brain cancers, examining the effects of radiation therapy on both cancerous and noncancerous cells.
“One of the things we saw was if we make a cancer-like cell, it becomes much more sensitive to anything when it’s under starvation conditions,” Longo said. “It becomes confused and doesn’t know how to adapt.”
The study showed that fasting in periods of no more than 48 hours improved the effectiveness of radiation in treating glioma cells. Though healthy cells go in “to a protective mode” as a result of the fast, Longo said cancer cells are unable to adapt and protect themselves from the radiation therapy.
“When you starve a cell, what happens is there’s more of an effect on the tumor cells than there is on a normal cell because the tumor cells are rapidly deteriorating,” said Thomas Chen, co-director of the USC Norris Neuro-Oncology Program and a co-author of the study. “When we starved the animals before giving them the chemotherapy, what we’ve done is we’ve made the tumor cells more susceptible because they don’t have as much energy or access to glucose as they normally do.”
Chen said that, although glioma is not curable, the mice who fasted during their treatment lived longer than those who did not fast as well those who only fasted.
“What we have from the animals looks very promising from the combination of the starvation diet with chemotherapy,” Chen said.
Longo said some glioma patients have already tried fasting in addition to their chemotherapy or radiation therapy, but he does not recommend patients use the treatment without medical supervision.
Chen noted that his plans to do a clinical trial in the future will likely run into difficulties with the fasting itself.
“It’s hard for patients to comply with. It’s hard for the patients to say, ‘I’m not going to eat before my chemotherapy,’” Chen said. “One of the things that we’re doing is basically making up a diet so that you can eat something and not feel so bad and basically have a low caloric intake.”
Chen said the unorthodox nature of this treatment could assist in treatment of glioma in human patients because the current standard treatment, orally ingesting the chemotherapy drug Temozolomide, is a slow process that loses effectiveness once the drug has reached the brain. Combining this traditional treatment with a starvation diet, and therefore a weakening of cancer cells, could improve the effectiveness of treatment.
“The drug itself … is not as effective as it can be,” he said. “Any kind of help along, like the starvation diet, will probably help the patient.”
This finding would not surprise me especially given some of the “foods” that patients are told to eat during treatment.  While this is encouraging that fasting MIGHT affect the cancer, it has been proven through decades of properly constructed studies that reducing the intake of animal protein to below 5% and eliminating sugar stops tumor growth.  I am not surprised at how hard the cancer machine works to keep this information quiet because there is so much money in research, drugs, and treatment that this simple change in diet could cause the industry to shrink and funding to slow.
Please lets start this discussion as part of cancer treatment-Read The China Study by Dr. T Colin Campbell and Over Diagnosed by H Gilbert Welch
Puhlease,
The China Study was rubbish, and you are taking that 5% from Campbell’s study with casein.  He poisoned rats with aflatoxin, and only the 5% mice didn’t die off cancer.
Do you want to know why?
Because they didn’t have enough protein in their diet to make enzymes to degrade the poison.  Sure, metabolites of alfatoxin are cancerous; not the protein.
Sure, the 5% rats didn’t die from liver cancer.  But they didn’t live long either; they died from aflatoxin.
And the “animal protein” Campbell used in this study was casein.  Personally, I think it is illogical to draw such vast conclusions from a SINGLE SOURCE OF ANIMAL PROTEIN.

Miniature American flags lined Trousdale Parkway in a display of patriotism on Tuesday as students, faculty and staff members shared a few moments of silence to remember those who were lost in the Sept. 11, 2001 terrorist attacks 11 years ago.
I was so touched by this simple act of remembrance when I saw it on campus. Do you know who or what group put this up?

USC dropped one spot to No. 24 on U.S. News and World Report National University Rankings on Tuesday night.
The publication, which ranks colleges each year on 16 criteria such as fall acceptance rate and graduation rate, released its 2013 rankings at 9 p.m. PDT.
USC tied with UCLA — which was previously ranked No. 25 — and the University of Virginia for the No. 24 spot.
Harvard University and Princeton University tied for the top spot, with Yale University coming in third. West-coast schools Stanford University and California came in at No. 6 and 21, respectively.
All the colleges in the National Universities category on the site offer a variety of undergraduate majors, master’s and Ph.D. programs and place an emphasis on faculty research.
USC cannot advance in the ratings until it starts requiring subject matter SAT tests for admission.  These tests measure sustained study and in-depth knowledge of a particular subject.  These tests also provide a meaningful comparison of a student to the top 1or 2 percent of other college applicants for the relevant period.  By requiring these tests, USC could weed out those applicants who are bright but did not fully apply themselves in high school and now are coming to USC mostly to party.
With all this money we are giving to USC, shouldn’t we be rating higher than VIRGINA and UCLA?
A bit disappointing to all the faithful who give so much on the promise that the money will be well used.  
I wonder what the higher rated colleges have that we do not; I wonder if the Administration knows?
What those other universities have is a much higher endowment per student.  $3 billion is not enough for a university with 30,000+ students and aspirations of being unquestionably elite.
So much has been given; so much more is still needed.
I suppose it is time for the Nikias haters to come out of the woodwork.
I do not agree with everything he is doing: online education at USC seems to be an excuse for raising lots of money, putting so much emphasis on athletic fundraising seems out of proportion when there is such an obvious lack of facilities for the student population vs. the 700 or so NCAA athletes, but he is not doing a terrible job.
Steven Sample, he is not, unfortunately.
WOW–
OW!
We are going in the wrong direction here Mr. President.
I agree, you seem to be making a great effort at promoting the university. Maybe it is time to work on improving the College instead of just advertising it.
Great job Max!
Maybe you can put some of your hubris aside and concentrate on substance over style. Stop selling everything that is not nailed down, even selling the name of the College, (after 130 years of tradition) to Dornsife did not help, and concentrate on ethos and values and downsizing classes instead of increasing them.
 I’ve never seen anyone more concerned with getting his picture in the paper. All this self-promotion, in your face, go USC is not the way. Slow down, you cannot “Sprint Through a Marathon”. You are making mistakes in the culture you are creating. Everyone is watching, not everyone is cheering.
These rankings are ridiculous. How is Cal Tech 10th when they were once 5th?

At first sight, dorm rooms kind of look like hospital rooms. A prison cell, at worst. A temporary white box to live in, at best. That’s why adding a little flair to your dorm room can only make yourself feel better.
Especially as a freshman, decorating your dorm room can be valuable for preventing homesickness and generally alleviating the discomforts of moving into college. Not only does it help ease your transition, but a well-decorated dorm room is inviting. It’s no secret that people are more likely to stop and stay in a more attractive space.
And, just as high school students jazz up their uniforms, decorating your dorm room is an expression of your personality and your tastes. There’s no better way to enrich your tastes and your individuality than to live in them.
First and foremost, fill up your  wall space. No matter how vibrant your comforter or how many knick-knacks you have piled on your desk, white walls always appear bare with nothing more than a calendar. Urban Outfitters’ Apartment Furnishings department has some very clever (and sometimes sassy) wall art that’s perfect for college dorm rooms (think a poster of pickles that reads “I’m a big dill”).
Ikea, the Swedish superstore for home furnishing, sells minimalistic art for reasonable prices. A black-and-white print of a surfer is handsome and understated.
TJ Maxx and JCPenney offer cheaper posters. But don’t let the prices excite you too much; moderation is key.
“Try to minimize the visible wall space, but don’t go overboard. A couple simpler posters well placed are better than a dozen, in my opinion.” said Christophe Pellissier, an undeclared freshman, whose own posters display Game of Thrones and Edward Scissorhands.
For the more crafty among you, magazine ads cut into letters and assembled as a name or mantra express a thrifty and creative side. Use this wall art as a talking point with people who pass your room or as a way to bond with your roommate.
A clothespin-dotted wire makes for a cool and inexpensive photo display. Major shops such as Target, Michael’s and Walmart sell cheap arts and crafts supplies for different projects like this. And CVS will print photos for less than $3.
Your efforts will not go unnoticed.
“You can really learn a lot about a person by how they decorate their room and what photos they have up,” said Connie Chen, a freshman majoring in accounting. “My roommate is pretty familiar with all of my high school friends because of the collage in my room.”
As for floor space, never underestimate the powers of a fuzzy rug. People are always, always willing to plop down on a comfortable surface to chat or eat. Decent rugs are around $30 at Target and are well worth the investment.
Dressers and desks can be similarly versatile. Dorm dressers pulled from underneath the beds and draped in a colorful fabric (maybe a scarf or small tablecloth) make for attractive nightstands.
“You can also pull out your desk to expand your work space, which really helps when you’re studying,” said Tomi Akingbola, a freshman majoring in biological sciences.
When not studying at your pull-out desk, get creative with your use of space and color. The space under a heightened bed can make for an incredibly cozy hang-out or study nook — but don’t forget to color-coordinate the pillows down there with the rest of your bedding.
Finally, play around with lights. If you want to have a two-person dance party with your roommate, look into getting a mini strobe light or mini disco ball from Target. If you talk to your RA, you could possibly get lanterns or Christmas lights as an alternative to those blinding, fluorescent ceiling lights.
Just don’t set your room on fire. Burnt and blackened furniture might be an expression of identity, but not one you’ll want to communicate.

Many musicians love to focus on debauchery. Parties and other moments of indulgence seem to fuel song after song.
Electronic music, which caters to fast-paced, often superficial hedonism, especially picks up on these subjects.
But rarely does a band focus on the dark corners of pleasure.

Blaqk Audio not only does, but manages to turn the focus into an addictive, exciting album. Bright Black Heaven, the electronic duo’s follow-up to its 2007 debut CexCells, proves well worth the wait.
From the start, Bright Black Heaven sets itself apart from a lot of the electronic music on the market. The opening track “Cold War” immediately establishes the album’s bleak themes. Eschewing a verse-chorus-verse format, the song builds off soft synthesizers to a swelling crescendo and a lyrical cliffhanger of jealousy.
The songs in Bright Black Heaven focus on dark topics — betrayal, envy, voyeurism and isolation among them — but the album never wallows in that darkness. As with the hinting softness in “Cold War,” there’s an air of elegance to each track. Though Bright Black Heaven is a meditation on hedonism, it more so explores the lies and secrets hidden by it.
In other words, don’t expect big club music. The electronic categorization relies not in vocal loops or rave-inducing beats, but rather in slowly developing tracks. The songs are danceable, but in a more intimate way.
Jade Puget’s compositions mix intense beats with almost sensual melodies to give each track an intensity, but one doesn’t overshadow emotion. “Fade to White” and “Faith Healer” are the perfect examples.
And despite shared themes and subjects, no two songs sound the same. Because of these shared themes and subjects, though, Bright Black Heaven is able to shift from faster-paced tracks to electronic ballads without ever feeling jarring or disjointed.
Some songs even evoke the work of electronic music’s best artists. There are touches of Depeche Mode in the opening of “With Your Arms Around You.” Other songs bring to mind Underworld. But unlike the British duo, Blaqk Audio puts equal focus on its music and vocals.
Bright Black Heaven is an excellent showcase for Davey Havok’s vocal range. In less than an hour, he sweeps through ominous ballads and soaring anthems. So many of the songs, such as “Deconstructing Gods” or “Bliss,” rely on a kind of throaty, sensual delivery for their main hooks. Paired with Puget’s compositions, the songs build, and Havok’s restrained verses become commanding choruses.
That said, Havok can still deliver some intense vocals. “Say Red” showcases his roots as a hardcore singer.
Each song on Bright Black Heaven succeeds, but none more so than “The Witness.” The music is slick and uptempo, with a pulsating beat from Puget. Havok, in his greatest vocal display, sums up the album’s hedonist themes in the bridge, singing, “I wanna hear you say this is your final confession / ‘I’ve never felt like this before’ / I must admit, must say I loved your final submission / Oh, you’ve never looked so good before.”
The album ends on a softer — but still impressive — note. The closing song “Ill-Lit Ships” deviates admirably from the dominant sounds of the earlier tracks. It’s a piano-driven number in which Havok croons over crescendos.
If “The Witness” is the best example of Blaqk Audio’s more uptempo style, “Ill-Lit Ships” is the best of duo’s softer side.
Unless musical tastes suddenly change, Bright Black Heaven won’t be the soundtrack at your next rave. Instead, Blaqk Audio has chosen to explore a side of electronic music that isn’t in the spotlight, and the result is a beautifully crafted album.
Blaqk Audio not only transcends a sophomore slump, it grows as a band.

It’s dusk and you’re walking down the Manhattan Beach Pier. Looking out at the never-ending ocean, you remember the tumultuous summer that just ended, the summer where you lost your significant other to mere circumstance. The sun is finally swallowed by the ocean and you’re left alone with your futile thoughts as you finally accept the bleak reality of life.
Sound like the plot to a 1950s film noir? Close enough. It’s actually the film that plays in your mind when listening to The Raveonettes’ delectably desolate new album, Observator.
Sharin Foo and Sune Rose Wagner make up the critically acclaimed The Raveonettes, and the Danish duo has become a fixture in the indie-pop, neo-garage rock movement.
Emerging on the scene in the early 2000s, many critics considered them yet another flash in the pan — the overwhelming hype of bands such as The Strokes, The Vines and The White Stripes left little room for other bands of the same movement to be taken seriously. But The Raveonettes’ unique blend of ’50s-style simple song structures, seamless harmonies and melancholy lyrics painted against a backdrop of major guitar fuzz quickly put the band on the path of critical success.
Officially set for release last Tuesday, Observator is the duo’s sixth full length album. The record follows 2011’s Raven in the Grave, which saw the band depart from its usual composition styles and go instead for a more gothic and uneven sound. Observator finds the band going back to its roots by featuring the trademark, inimitable shoegazing-on-the-beach musique noir that they’ve mastered so effortlessly.
The ironic placement of poppy harmonies and song structures against an overwhelmingly distorted sound has become a trademark for the band. Add in some lyrics that could be dialogue from The Big Sleep, and you’ve got the makings of a wonderfully gloomy Raveonettes record.
From the steadily mellow and pensive opener “Young and Cold” to the majestically noisy closer “Till the End,” Observator takes the listener on a journey worthy of the best 1950s dime store pulp fiction. “Young and Cold” sets the stage for a flashback of that tumultuous summer, which the following seven songs aurally paint. “Observations” marks the first time the band has used a piano and is the perfect soundtrack for a fateful meeting, while Foo’s dreamy and ethereal vocals on “Curse the Night” make it clear that love is in the air. Songs like the Blondie-inspired “The Enemy,” the ’60s-pop-put-through-a-noise-blender “Downtown,” and the grungy “You Hit Me (I’m Down)” fill out the narrative of the rollercoaster ride of summer passion and all build up to the closing track, a final epiphany of freedom through dreamy distortion.
The raucously serene noir chronicle that is Observator was no accident — as he states on The Raveonettes’ official website, Wagner had been going through a particularly turbulent summer filled with disappointment, disaffection and depression. Tempted by the Pacific pull and inspired by the inherently Californian music of The Doors, Wagner set out for Los Angeles.
Expecting to find the answer to all his problems on Venice Beach, Wagner instead found nothing but more bleakness and solitude wrapped up in the beauty of California. After a four-day binge on benzos, booze and buddies, Wagner finally got the inspiration he needed to create an album that mirrored his experience — beautiful in sound, bleak at heart.
To further capture an authentic West Coast feel, Foo and Wagner recorded the album at Sunset Sound Studios, the legendary recording space frequented by The Doors. Recorded in only seven days, Observator comes out as a testament to the beauty of loneliness and the strange experiences that make up our lives.
“For so long, I tried to capture a new muse and carve out a path forward for us,” Wagner said on the band’s official website. “I travelled thousands of miles to find it and experienced all kinds of insanity along the way. Yet all the while, the future of The Raveonettes was in the people, the occurrences and the relationships that were immediately around me. [The album is] a collection of observations that occur in life and as I’ve learned, life happens everywhere.”
So the next time you’re thinking of brooding on the Manhattan Beach Pier with your toxic elixir of choice, instead of ruminating yourself to ruin, give Observator a try. Whether it’s taking in the strangely pleasant distorted sounds or relating to the anti-hero lyrics you picture Humphrey Bogart muttering, Observator offers such a romantic rendering of dejection that you’ll end the record genuinely optimistic that it’s only when you’ve lost it all that you can gain it all.

Some of the best films address tricky societal themes, reflecting real life issues. Writer-director Paul Thomas Anderson’s hotly anticipated The Master, which hits theaters in limited release Sept. 14, is no exception.
The film tackles the issue of religion and documents Lancaster “The Master” Dodd’s (Philip Seymour Hoffman) pursuit to spread his ever-growing faith-based organization “The Cause” with Navy veteran and new right-hand man Freddie Quell (Joaquin Phoenix) by his side.
Even with what’s supposed to be a fictional religious organization, The Master has sparked controversy with its allusions to Scientology as well as Dodd’s uncanny resemblance to Scientology’s founder L. Ron Hubbard. This controversy, in turn, has inspired a flurry of questions regarding spirituality in films. One prominent question: What do representations of religion in modern film say about the contemporary discourse surrounding the topic?
Answer: As it stands, they don’t say much at all. And the crux of the problem lies in that modern depictions of religion can be broken into three simplistic categories: overtly zealous, horror-based and satirical.
Mel Gibson’s The Passion of the Christ stands apart as one of the most iconic and controversial religious films of our time, largely because of the film’s gruesome depiction of the crucifixion of Jesus Christ. Additionally, the film found massive success at the box office, raking in a staggering $370.8 million in domestic gross to date. For comparison’s sake, Peter Jackson’s The Lord of the Rings: Return of the King, the epic finale of the popular trilogy based on J.R.R. Tolkien’s classic literary series, was released just a couple months before Passion and grossed $377.8 million domestically.
Though religion serves as a major cornerstone of American and worldwide culture, the ability of Passion to rival a huge action blockbuster’s lifetime domestic gross was unheard of. Box office figures can’t account for religious demographics, but the staggering success of such a devout work might just suggest that there is a more significant role for religion on and off the screen.
But is it really fair for us to say that a film like Passion creates the space for religious discourse when it really just puts Christianity on a pedestal for pre-existing followers? This isn’t necessarily an attack on Passion, mind you. It’s worth noting, however, that Passion’s overly zealous nature courted more media-frenzied controversy than thoughtful discussion, even though its success might’ve suggested otherwise.
Similarly, many horror films and comedies often include spiritual content without necessarily progressing discourse on religion, instead choosing to use spirituality as a plot device.
Creating the association between fear and religion inherently discourages open, balanced discussion of spirituality. This is particularly true with the horror subgenre of “possession” films, including The Exorcist, The Rite and, more recently, The Possession.
This isn’t to say that all films with religious content need to have a greater message about God or the afterlife. Still, a better balance could encourage people to realistically discuss religion without the fear of political correctness or taboo hanging over their heads.
Satirical comedies aren’t exactly doing the trick either. Featuring a ragtag group of Catholic girls led by Mandy Moore, 2004’s Saved parodies extremely devout teens who cannot accept homosexuality or pre-marital sex. The film developed a cult following, but once again, the issue here is not about the individual work. Instead, it hints at the larger collection of satirical films about religion — a collection that focuses on extremes rather than varied, well-rounded religious portrayals.
Both horror and satirical works bring religion into the public domain, but in a way that can turn viewers off from religion. Where are the representations of average, hardworking people who have strong roots in faith? Why are religious characters restricted to being possessed or “Jesus-freaks”? Why do characters’ religions have to define them in such over-the-top ways?
The issue here is not the quantity of religious depictions in film — it’s the quality. So it’s time that filmmakers take advantage of this creative platform to its full effect, using their creativity as a tool to better inform audiences and create a useful conversation about the role of religion in our lives.
The Master might just be a step in the right direction. Perhaps the film will prove to be more than just “the Scientology movie,” as it has been popularly dubbed, and instead get moviegoers thinking about deeper issues such as the nature of faith and trusting the word of a single religious leader or organization.
We know that religion holds a serious and important place in culture and society today — it’s about time that filmmakers took that to heart.

Most actors would be satisfied starring in an Emmy-nominated sitcom. Perhaps they’d film a small movie role during a hiatus then sit back, relax and rake in the syndication benefits.
But most actors aren’t Josh Radnor.
Twice the talent · Josh Radnor stars in his new dramedy Liberal Arts, his first film since 2010’s Happythankyoumoreplease. – | Photo courtesy of IFC Films
When he’s not working on How I Met Your Mother, Radnor spends his time writing, directing and starring in some of his own films.
“I get kind of restless,” Radnor said. “I like work that seems meaningful, and the show has been such a blessing in my life, but it can only satisfy so much creatively. There were a lot of parts of myself that I feel like I can’t use on the show. Crafting my own stories and collaborating [was] just really thrilling to me.”
His first feature, Happythankyoumoreplease, won the U.S. Audience Award at the Sundance Film Festival.
Radnor’s latest effort is Liberal Arts, a quiet but beautiful ode to college life and the trials and tribulations of growing up. And though the film was squeezed rather exhaustively into his schedule, Radnor was able to complete and screen the film in less than two years.
“My first film took a lot longer to write and [fund], and I wrote the draft of this very quickly this one summer, and it sort of tumbled out of me,” Radnor said. “The producers who financed [Liberal Arts] were thrilled with Happythankyoumoreplease and so we were financed 11 months after finishing the script, which is unheard of.”
Shooting began a few months after financing was secure, and Radnor was able to re-experience college life — even at his alma mater.
In Liberal Arts, Radnor stars as Jesse, a college admissions counselor living a mundane existence in New York City. When Jesse is invited back to Kenyon College by an old professor, he meets the beautiful and impossibly intelligent Zibby, played by Elizabeth Olsen.
Radnor wasn’t the only alum to revisit his roots: Veteran actress Allison Janney — who makes a thrilling appearance as a hyper-sexed professor — also attended the small liberal arts school.
“That was terrific, when [Janney’s] name came up in discussions,” Radnor said. “I love the Kenyon connection; it just gives it a little more richness.”
Radnor’s connection to the college helped the film get an authentic feel.
“I’ve heard from a lot of people who went to other liberal arts colleges and other universities, and it seems to have some sort of appeal and connection,” Radnor said.
By shooting on Kenyon’s actual campus, the film showcases — in a dramatically real way — the beautiful averageness of college life. From Zibby’s cluttered dorm room to arguments about vampire novels, the film reeks of reality.
“It was really thrilling to shoot on campus,” Radnor said. “We had all these Kenyon students who were graduating or still in school, and it was really great to see kids witness and be able to help them have a great first [filming] experience.”
The subject matter of the film seems ridiculous at first: The young and beautiful Zibby and the disheveled Jesse start a relationship through beautifully written letters. But Radnor knows how to dig deeper into his stories, and keep them rooted in realism.
“I suppose there’s not a lot of robots and superheros,” Radnor said. “I’m always attracted to films that feel relevant with real people who go through real stuff. I think people are wrestling with self-acceptance and the kind of daily struggle of being a human being and being awake and alert in the world. I think that’s a heroic battle and worthy of putting up on the screen.”
In Liberal Arts, Jesse battles with aging while Zibby tries to grow up at an accelerated rate. And while age versus maturity is certainly a running theme throughout the film, Radnor notes that the idea of rebellion is also an important theme to factor in.
“There’s a time to say yes, and a time to say no,” Radnor said. “One of the things I’ve been realizing is that in the ’50s, it was all about repression, limitations and restrictions. The ’60s were all about busting free, and now we’re in a time where you can be anything. The real rebellion is all about restraint, and that’s something that Jesse’s wrestling with.”
 
Liberal Arts will be released Friday, Sept. 14th.

As ’90s kids, we might not remember watching The Silence of the Lambs when it first premiered.
The 1991 flick puts movie viewers in the uncomfortable situation of watching traumatized FBI agent Clarice Starling, played by a younger Jodi Foster, being psychologically probed by the creepy Hannibal Lecter, rendered by Anthony Hopkins. Viewers will remember Lecter’s unabashed cannibalism and Starling’s recurring mental trauma.
Screaming with laughter · Christine Lakin (right), as Clarice Starling, mimics Jodie Foster’s facial expressions in Silence! The Musical. Davis Gaines, as Hannibal Lecter, also gives a hilarious performance. – | Photo courtesy of Michael Lamont
Sounds like a pretty serious story, but even parts of the original production could draw a chuckle or two. Lecter’s over-the-top penchant for human flesh gets kind of funny at times and Starling’s vulnerability eventually seems ridiculous.
Jon and Al Kaplan took all of this into consideration when making their web series Silence! Silence of the Lambs the Musical,  which went viral in 2002. In the hands of writer Hunter Bell and director and choreographer Christopher Gattelli, the series becomes a riotously funny stage production.
You don’t need to memorize the plot of The Silence of the Lambs to enjoy Silence! The Musical — one of the production’s many strengths. Anyone with a raunchy sense of humor would laugh out loud at the musical’s shamelessly dirty songs. An entire number is dedicated to a seedy insult that one of Lecter’s fellow inmates throws at Starling. During the crude song, an en pointe ballet dancer gracefully adds a physical rendition of the hilarious but vulgar lyrics. There was hardly a move the dancer delivered that did not result in laughter from the crowd.
Lecter and Starling come to life as humorous renditions of otherwise serious characters through a few clever decisions. Christine Lakin perfectly captures Jodi Foster’s distinctive word pronunciation — each “s” sounding like a mouthful of “sh.”  It’s a distinct Foster manner of speaking and Lakin carries it successfully throughout the musical. The musical continues to poke fun at Foster when Starling finds herself in the dark pointing at random corners; at one point a poster of Foster’s directorial flop, The Beaver,  makes her scream. As Lecter, Davis Gaines holds onto to the cannibal’s creepiness while using his resounding voice to deliver the funniest of numbers.
The show’s hilarity extends to its secondary characters. Stephen Bienskie as Buffalo Bill aka Jame Gumb keeps us laughing. Bienskie takes the serial killer and makes him both pathetic and creepy with his song “Are You About a Size 14?”,  which focuses on his fixation with overweight women. Yet the character does not achieve the success of Lecter and Starling; at times it is difficult to hear Bienskie’s voice, especially over the chorus. His numbers draw chuckles, but the lyrics oftentimes get lost among other noises. Whether a directorial or acting fault, the discrepancy takes away from his character’s best moments.
Yet the musical cleverly pays attention to the small details. In one scene, Jeff Skowron — in the role of Dr. Chilton — carries away a staircase prop with the words, “I have to do this part myself.” The lambs show their own hilarious facial expressions, and even the no-name guards create a lot of laughter with their silly conversations. LaToya London plays a female FBI agent who eventually sings about her motivations during “Catherine Dies Today.” The agent also gets quite close with Starling, giving the musical a subplot that definitely did not come through in the movie.
By the end of the musical, nudity, raunchy humor, gay jokes, cannibalism jokes and everything in between have come together to create two hours of virtually non-stop humor. The strength of the musical lies in the fact that it does not deviate completely from the movie. Instead, Silence! creates a plot that feeds off the more ridiculous personalities and plot twists of the flick. With a talented, flexible cast and smart directorial choices Silence! proves an engaging, well-thought unauthorized parody.
The Silence of the Lambs might be more than 10 years old, but the musical’s modern humor will hook you and make two hours feel like a much shorter time span filled with undeniable fun.
 
Silence! The Musical shows Thursday-Saturday at 8 p.m. and Sundays at 3 p.m. and 7 p.m at the Hayworth Theatre, located at 2511 Wilshire Blvd.

Pac-12 signs Dish
Much to the delight of fans around the country, Pac-12 Enterprises and Dish Network has reached a deal, the conference said in a statement Saturday.
The network will be distributed to millions of people around the country.
The station, which began broadcasting in mid-August, had received criticism for not being widely available to those who wanted to watch the network. The only carriers for the station currently are Time Warner Cable, Cox, Comcast and Brighthouse, according to the Los Angeles Daily News. Notable carriers missing include DirecTV and Charter Communications.
The Pac-12 Network will show more than 800 events a year, including several events that will not be available through other stations, including the USC-California game on Sept. 22 at the Coliseum.
Huskies on the pitch
Pac-12 soccer was dominated by a pair of players from Washington last week, as sophomore forward Jaclyn Softli and senior goalkeeper Karli Davidson won conference player of the week honors for women’s soccer, the Pac-12 announced Tuesday.
A backup, Softili helped the Huskies improve their record to  7-0 on the season by scoring a goal against Notre Dame and another against Gonzaga. Washington is ranked No. 23 in the country.
Davidson, on the other hand, did her damage on the defensive side of things. She had four saves against Notre Dame and a whopping 11 against Gonzaga. She did not give up a goal last week. The Huskies next game is against Utah State in Logan, Utah, on Thursday.
Teeing it up
The USC women’s golf team began its quest for a national championship this week, finishing in third place at the College of Charleston Cougar Classic in South Carolina.
The Women of Troy were led by junior Sophia Popov, who finished the tournament 1-under-par 215. Sophomore Doris Chen finished with the same score.
As a whole, the team finished at 1-under-par 863. Florida won the tournament, finishing 12-under-par.
USC finished last season the season No. 3 in the country, behind Alabama and UCLA.
Though women’s golf is majorily a spring sport, USC plays in three tournaments during the fall. It will next play in the 2012 Fall Preview at the University of Georgia starting Oct. 5. They will wrap up the fall season at the Stanford Invitational in Palo Alto, Calif.
Big time players
UCLA senior running back Johnathan Franklin and sophomore linebacker D.J. Welch were named Pac-12 Player of the Week for the offensive and defensive sides of the ball, respectively, the Pac-12 announced earlier this week.
In an upset of then-No. 16 Nebraska, Franklin rushed for 217-yards, leading UCLA to a 36-30 victory at the Rose Bowl. Franklin is currently the nation’s leading rusher, having run for 431-yards in two games. UCLA is ranked No. 22 in the Associated Press poll.
Welch had seven tackles in the Beavers upset victory of then No. 13 Wisconsin. It was the Beaver’s first game of the season, as their scheduled season opener against Nicholls State was postponed because of Hurricane Issac.
Special teams Player of the Week honors went to Arizona kicker John Bonano, who three field goals in an upset over then-No. 18 Oklahoma State.
It was a great day for me last Saturday when I saw that the Pac-12 Network games were available on Dish. I’m glad I could flip to the Fresno State/Oregon game and others with my Hopper’s GameFinder App. The Pac-12 Network is part of my Dish subscription so I found all the available games through the app all day. A coworker at Dish told me about this feature, and it’s helped me keep up with the scores in real time, instead of relying on the sports ticker. I can’t wait for the USC/Cal game since it will be a big conference test for the Trojans, but I think they’ll be in the national championship game!

Incoming freshman wide receiver Darreus Rogers will wait to enroll at USC until January, allowing him to greyshirt, ESPNLosAngeles.com’s Blair Angulo reported  Monday.
Just days earlier, Rogers announced on his Twitter account that he had been cleared by the NCAA Eligibility Center to play for the Trojans.
USC, however, has already accumulated its 75 scholarship limit under the current sanctions the NCAA has imposed, meaning the Trojans would have to get creative to fit Rogers on the team. The Trojans are deep at receiver currently, with junior Robert Woods and sophomore Marqise Lee leading the way, while freshman Nelson Algohor and junior De’Von Flournoy have also seen time in 2012.
As Rogers missed all of fall camp and the first two games of the regular season, he was highly unlikely to participate in any game action for the 2012 season.
But instead of redshirting, USC designated Rogers as a greyshirt, ensuring he doesn’t use another scholarship this semester.
A greyshirt is used when a school has reached its maximum number of players allowed under scholarship, forcing them to delay the arrival of a player by a semester. By waiting to enroll until January 2013, Rogers will be able to eventually earn a scholarship and will keep his first year of eligibility intact.
The 6-foot-2 Rogers was a four-star recruit from Carson Senior High School who finished his senior season with 1,251 yards and 10 touchdowns on 64 receptions.
He earned several honors as a senior, being named a Super Prep All-American, Cal Hi All-State first team member and co-Player of the Year in the Marine League. As a junior he caught 45 passes for 1,347 yards and eight touchdowns and made the Cal Hi All-State underclassman team.
The Trojans are set to bring in Rogers along with three verbal commits at wide receiver from the class of 2013 — Sebastian Larue, Eldridge Massington and Steven Mitchell. All three verbal commits are considered four-star players by Rivals.com.

When USC men’s basketball coach Kevin O’Neill was questioned about the possibility of losing guard Maurice Jones to injury or other circumstances prior to the start of the 2011-2012 season, he took on a near-apocalyptic tone.
“Don’t come to the games,” O’Neill said at Pac-12 Media Day in 2011. “It’ll be ugly. Don’t show up. If we don’t have this guy, it’ll be very difficult for us to be competitive in major college games.”
Sidelined · Maurice Jones led the 6-26 Trojans in scoring last season with 13 points per game. Despite his absence, USC is expected to be better in 2012. – Carlo Acenas | Daily Trojan
As it turns out, the games were ugly and rarely competitive even with Jones on the court. The Trojans were historically bad, sporting a 6-26 record. But now, months removed from the worst regular season in school history, and despite the loss of Jones because of academic issues, O’Neill is singing a decidedly more positive tune.
“We’re going to miss [Mo],” O’Neill told the Daily Trojan last week. “We’d be better with him, but I’m confident we have some guys who can do the job.”
O’Neill is referring to an influx of new talent — six additions in all — plus the healthy returns of senior point guard Jio Fontan, junior center Dewayne Dedmon and senior forward Aaron Fuller. Is the head coach spewing feel-good quotes to keep his team’s psyche afloat before the start of the season? Or, does he really believe they can weather the storm without Jones? I’d lean toward the latter.
USC Athletic Director Pat Haden exerted patience with the head coach because no one could have turned a squad ravaged by so many injuries into anything near decent.
Even still, O’Neill knows a run in the NCAA tournament will be necessary to keep his job beyond this season. Framing the loss of Jones as catastrophic (even if it’s not true) would be a fair ulterior motive for anyone who wants to stick around as head coach.
O’Neill has been in this business a long time, he knows how to play the public relations game. Instead, he’s taking on a message of positivity — losing Jones hurts, but this team is good enough to compete anyway. He believes they can win this season.
The reason for his renewed faith? This group of players far surpasses the talent level of last year’s squad.
USC took a chance on a bunch of transfers—two from Wake Forest (junior guard J.T. Terrell and junior forward Ari Stewart), plus senior forward Eric Wise from UC Irvine and senior forward Renaldo Woolridge from Tennessee.
The return of Fontain and Fuller along with a more polished Dedmon also helps, and underclassmen like sophomore forward Byron Wesley benefited from plenty of minutes on a team with zero depth.
In fact, there’s a good chance Jones, who ranked sixth in the nation in minutes per game last season, wouldn’t even start on this Trojans team. Fontan figures to play point guard and serve as the team captain, and Terrell is a high-scoring two guard who averaged 24 minutes per game as a freshman at Wake Forest.
As a sixth man, Jones would certainly been valuable. But the combination of two freshman guards along with sharpshooter Allen should be enough to supplant USC’s arguably two best players whenever they need a breather.
In truth, Jones’ impact on last year’s squad may have been a bit overstated. He led the team in most major statistical categories (including points, assists and steals), but was the only Division I-worthy guard able to log major minutes and take on ball-handling duties.
He finished a dismal 34 percent from the field, including 30 percent from three point range — which, to be fair, was surely the result of having to take an inordinate amount of shots when others could not. This is neither a condemnation nor an excuse for his performance — rather, a reflection of what Jones can contribute.
On a really awful team, he can serve as a confident playmaker who isn’t going to single-handily pull out very many victories. On a good team like this year’s Trojans might be, he’s somewhere in between a fringe starter and a very valuable role player.
And for that reason, USC should be able to compete for an NCAA tournament bid with or without him in 2012-2013.

After a 42-29 win against Syracuse, No. 2 USC now shifts its focus to its Pac-12 opener against No. 21 Stanford Saturday in Palo Alto, Calif.
Though Stanford will no longer have quarterback Andrew Luck, USC coach Lane Kiffin thinks the Cardinal still feature many weapons to utilize on the field.
Unselfish · USC coach Lane Kiffin praised sophomore tight ends Randall Telfer (left) and Xavier Grimble (right) for their blocking against the Orange. Grimble also scored a 22-yard touchdown in the fourth quarter. – Carlo Acenas | Daily Trojan
“They seem to have leaned on the running game, which is still really good,” Kiffin said. “They still have a really good offensive line and a great front seven. They’re going to be tough all year long for whoever they play.”
To neutralize Stanford’s running game, USC will have to subdue running back Stepfan Taylor, who has 185 yards and two touchdowns on the ground this season.
Kiffin also noted Stanford’s multiple front defensive scheme and how it can cause trouble for any offense.
“It puts pressure on everybody — on your offensive line, on your tight ends in protection and your backs in protection and your receivers and their hot routes,” Kiffin said. “Anytime you play these multiple front defenses, everybody has got to be on the same page.”
Looking back to last week’s win against Syracuse, Kiffin repeated his praise for the team in its ability to adjust to the weather delay at MetLife Stadium in East Rutherford, N.J.
“Our players did a really good job, handled the situation well, came out and played a really good second half,” he said.
Kiffin also recognized the efforts of the redshirt freshmen tight end duo of Xavier Grimble and Randell Telfer, who have made their presence felt in the blocking game.
“Xavier and Randell played really well. They only got one catch between the two of them, but they’re very unselfish,” Kiffin said. “They block extremely well in the run game and for those outside screens.”
The Trojans will look to continue their winning ways and capitalize on their strengths, but Kiffin and the team concede that doing so against the consistent Cardinal will be no easy task.
“They’re really veteran when you look at their defense. They’ve been together for a really long time,” Kiffin said. “Their players are really smart, and they don’t make very many mistakes. You got to play really well to beat them.”

Thousands of protestors descended on Chinatown, in Downtown Los Angeles, this June as part of the country’s largest anti-Walmart demonstration since the company first opened in 1962.
Max Rubin | Daily Trojan
Today, despite the disapproval of the city of Los Angeles and many of its residents, the impending construction of a Walmart in Chinatown continues to menace members of the local community, business owners and visitors — including USC students.
For more than 70 years, small businesses have thrived on the streets of Chinatown. Customers can dine at hole-in-the-wall restaurants and browse in fruit and vegetable shops, meat markets and boutiques. Storeowners and staff ask prices and hawk goods in their own language. Some visitors wander around, soaking in the reality of another culture at work.
Enter Walmart, the pinnacle of mass commercialism and the scourge of working class people everywhere. The idea of opening such a business in a neighborhood like Chinatown infuriated Los Angeles and its residents when it was initially proposed in March. The L.A. City Council even tried to pass an emergency ban on opening chain stores in Chinatown, though they were unable to do so in time.
Walmart threatens three essential elements of our beloved and unique L.A. community: business culture, aesthetics and morale.
Larger chain retailers like Walmart damage small business appeal. They can manufacture, transport and distribute in bulk, meaning they can keep their prices lower and their inventory more consistent than small businesses can. Their physical and systemic size also allows them to produce and sell a wider range of items, so customers can buy all their goods in one place.
Unfortunately, students like these type of stores. What college student doing last-minute dorm shopping doesn’t go for cheap prices and speed? But if we start liking those stores too much, brute market forces will soon leave them as the only kind of stores left.
Small business communities, such as the Venice Beach Boardwalk or the stores and small restaurants on Vermont Avenue, are what allow these endangered retailers a fighting chance. Their aggregation creates a simulated experience of one-stop shopping convenience, as well as the chance to develop a particular cultural appeal, such as a street performance or a network for non-English speakers, associated with shopping at their stores.
When large businesses like Walmart infiltrate local communities, these benefits disappear. As small businesses are forced to compete more fiercely to survive, they turn against one another as well, and the cultural fluidity and collaborative atmosphere that give them an advantage over larger stores are soon lost.
If the community offers a particular ethno-cultural experience, the big store can also delegitimize the community’s ethnic or cultural character.
In a The New York Times article last week, Chinatown native Christlily Chiv said that the arrival of commercial corporations in the neighborhood would “erase the cultural community and what it stood for in the first place.”
A space that has historically served as a haven for Chinese immigrants to acculturate themselves, for Chinese students and travelers to have a piece of home and for other Angelenos to get a taste of China faces extinction by, instead, becoming a cheap imitation.
The community would also be hurt by the nature of Walmart itself. Walmart has been repeatedly criticized for hiring non-union workers and for grossly underpaying them, particularly in countries like China.
The construction of Walmart is thus a significant, symbolic blow, demoralizing the substantial working class and immigrant population that lives, works and shops in Chinatown.
A Walmart in Chinatown threatens the livelihood of Chinatown residents and the cultural offerings of Los Angeles. It is a mistake for the construction to go forward and a shame for everyone living in Los Angeles, ourselves included.

Talk about sore losers!
Wal Mart has followed all the rules. It will be a small market in a space that had been empty for years and had a market previously.
It is not even in Chinatown but Chinatown adjacent.
They played by the rules and still the Union beholden City Government wants to stop them.
Shame. Fair is fair.
Francesca, thanks for your article. I lived and worked in Chinatown and its nearby neighborhoods, I agree 100% with what you’re saying. It will hurt small businesses. And also the issue of morale — just yesterday Walmart-contracted warehouse workers went on strike. Walmart is a horrible business model. 
http://www.dailykos.com/story/2012/09/12/1130877/-BREAKING-NEWS-Warehouse-Workers-United-Is-Now-ON-STRIKE
No, it’s a great business model. They return profits to their investors. Keep in mind who a business is intended to serve.
Walmart is one of the most capital efficient businesses on the Earth. Recently they have started farming subsidies from you guessed it TAXPAYERS to add solar power to their facilities. Walmart is no longer just about low prices, it is now about corporate citizenship, neighborhood sensitivity, sustainability, green power,…
If someone is visiting or moving to Chinatown for the Chinese culture, they went to the wrong place. They should be heading east to the SGV… I understand not wanting chains in a small business community, but I think the advantages far outweigh the “cultural” effects. I imagine that a Walmart in Chinatown would be able to cater specifically to that community as well, although I could be overestimating the company. 
Lastly, I wanted to point out how much I appreciated the irony of Chinatown becoming a “cheap imitation.”
lol… bring the cheap prices..  we will benefit from this.
I don’t see the difference.  Most of the goods sold at Walmart are made in China, same as the ones sold by the Chinese merchants.
“Walmart, the pinnacle of mass commercialism and the scourge of working class people everywhere.”  I think this statement is a little overdone and inaccurate.  Your article itself mentions that Walmart can compete by keeping its prices low.  I understand your arguments about how a Walmart may detract from the cultural offerings in Chinatown, but unless working class people are now in the habit of making irrational choices by ignoring price, I disagree that Walmart is the scourge of people who want affordability and choices.
Francesca,
So what do you offer in place of free markets?
Fight On!

Give Walmart a break!
I’m sure they will sell big bags of rice at a great price.

“Never again!” is the cry heard around the world — two words that recall both the fight against anti-Semitism after the Holocaust and a struggle for equality that continues today.
The phrase also serves as a reminder of the paramount importance of taking action rather than turning a blind eye to mass murder.
Unfortunately, the current civil war in Syria is proof that the brutal murder of citizens by a nation’s leader can still happen today. And for some reason, the world seems to have forgotten about it. So we sit idly by, hoping that something will change without our active involvement.
For several months, Syria was a hot-button topic for the news media, from breaking updates to a scandal over the firing of a journalist who profiled Syria’s first lady Asma al-Assad in Vogue. The news pointed to how the Arab Spring would help to finally rid the country of President Bashar al-Assad’s reign of violence.
Except it didn’t. Even though the Arab Spring had its share of martyrdoms and violence, at certain points during this period the president — some would say dictator — seemed prepared to step down after years of shady police dealings, murders and oligarchic rule.
But it appears as if al-Assad is here to stay.
The 18-month-old Syrian conflict has turned from an uprising into a full-on massacre on both sides. In the month of August alone, an estimated 5,000 Syrians died, and the majority of them civilians. Even more shocking, more than 100,000 refugees left Syria in August — a number that accounts for more than 40 percent of all Syrian refugees since the conflict began — according to CBS. This sharp increase in refugees, which doesn’t even include the tens of thousands of refugees who have not registered and those still in Syria who need aid, still underscores just how urgent the Syrian crisis has become.
It also adds urgency to the need for other countries to get involved. Russia and Iran have already joined in to defend al-Assad, while Saudi Arabia and Qatar have been struggling to help the opposition force. Meanwhile, President Barack Obama has just stuck with threats: He declared that the United States would intervene with military force if Syria showed signs of mobilizing “unconventional weapons” (previous reports had suggested al-Assad could have chemical or biological weaponry).
Three weeks have passed since that comment. Nothing seems to have changed, including the brutal war.
But to call this a war is naive. A war is a fight between two different sides; a war involves soldiers. A war is not fighting against your brother; a war is not bombing your countrymen’s homes while they lie in bed.
This is calculated murder, plain and simple.
And we will probably never join the rebels to rid them of their dictator. Obama has learned well from his predecessor just how costly war can be. Which is a shame, considering the fact that the United States could actually make a difference.
Finding a way into the country to give food or water relief might be next to impossible. We, however, are a military superpower, and if we decided to aid the rebels on a military front, this war could end more quickly than it would otherwise.
As Americans, it’s important that we fight for humanity, and not just when the issue directly affects us. Sometimes, you have to do what’s best for all people, a mission al-Assad has clearly shown his disdain for.
Students should do what they can to stimulate debate with each other, with professors, with friends and family to open up a wider conversation about possible solutions and ways the government can take action. The more students talk about Syria, the more people will realize that the United States has a chance to help save lives and that we must urge the government to do so.
For once, let’s try to prevent murder instead of just witnessing it.
 
Sheridan Watson is a junior majoring in film critical studies.
Why should we try to prevent murders in Syria when we have more than enough domestic problems already? Chicago’s South Side is turning into a warzone, we’ve got a drug war spilling over the southern border, and our economy is struggling. Especially after the murder of our ambassador last night, it’s time to stop trying to “save” the Middle East and focus on our domestic problems.
I have to agree with commenter “Tomy Trojan.” We have no reasonable way to intervene successfully in Syria, not with troops and not with aid. If we used the US military, we would find ourselves in another pointless, but bloody and punishing conflict like in Iraq and Afghanistan. Once again, American military personnel would bleed, die and be hideously maimed with no good outcome possible. We might succeed in toppling Assad if we commit our military forces, but consider the cost! We toppled Hussein, perhaps helping the Iraqi nation. Or perhaps not. This remains to be seen. Same in Afghanistan.
Ship medical supplies, food, humanitarian aid to Syria, then? Why? The Saudis are fabulously wealthy and are Sunnis, like the Syrians. This is in their backyard. Let them provide this support. They certainly provide enough support to worldwide terrorists. And we cannot support our own tens of millions of poor.
Sheridan Watson writes “As Americans, it’s important that we fight for humanity, and not just when the issue directly affects us…sometimes, you have to do what’s best for all people,” A noble sentiment. Was this true in Iraq? Afghanistan? Did we help much? And at what cost to Americans? How about Vietnam, 40 years ago? We lost 55,000 troops, untold hundreds of billions of dollars and split our nation into factions. About two million Vietnamese died, and then the country fell to Communism anyway. Did we help? 
Sometime we cannot help, and rather than suffer, bleed, die and take the other terrible losses, it is best to stay out of a conflict. We must pick our battles and limit them to supporting loyal allies and to those wars that can be won without disproportionate loss of American lives and treasure.
Hi Sheridan, this is a horrendous article and you are shining example of how ignorant some young Americans are regarding international affairs. You suggest that “maybe if we decided to aid the rebels” the war would end more quickly. Are you not aware of the fact that the CIA has been openly arming and funding the rebels for the past year, and that many of these rebels also happen to be Al-qaeda members who want to set up an Islamic dictatorship? This information is readily available from sources like the Washington Post, NY Times, Reuters, take your pick.
Yes Assad is a horrible horrible man, but you are terribly misinformed and I can’t believe an editor let this get lazy propaganda piece get published. I highly suggest you stick to writing about film, unless you are somewhat attractive and are looking to work for FOX/CNN/MSNBC in which case you are on the right track.
Sincerely,
A concerned student

Of the 1046 girls who rushed this semester, only 737 were offered bids from sororities. While some of these girls dropped out of the race on their own accord, countless others were disheartened after not receiving a bid.  As depressing as the situation is, asking sororities to offer more bids is not the solution.
I participated in rush this semester, but my goal wasn’t to join a particular sorority. I talked to a lot of girls during the process, and most of us were there for the same reason: we wanted a smaller, tight-knit community within the larger body of USC.
I witnessed many crying girls throughout the week – and, to be honest, was a bit of a mess myself at times. Joining a sorority has always been and will always be a stressful process, and many feelings are crushed along the way.
But suggesting that sororities offer bids to all who desire them is ultimately hurting the girls who elect to participate in rush. No, it doesn’t feel good to be dropped from a house you like – or dropped altogether. But most girls participate in the process to find a small group of girlfriends. If 200 more girls are thrown into the system, that small community becomes larger.
The 309 girls who started rush week and left without finding a sorority could pursue another social niche—joining a club, for example. But many girls are specifically attracted to the frequency of Greek activities, so a club is not a sufficient replacement. Sororities should offer those not accepted a more Greek-oriented alternative.
The houses could implement a system of “honorary” members—girls who would be invited to mixers and invites, but kept from the exclusivity of the house and chapter meetings.
The honorary members would repeatedly spend time with the same group of girls, providing them with the smaller community they previously desired. This would maintain the prestige of the house while still allowing more girls to participate in some of the big draws of Greek life.
Not everyone is cut out to be in a top sorority like DG or Theta.   I have often suggested to my sisters that SC should offer classes to freshman girls in make-up, hair, clothing and shoes for rush.   Rush comes so early in the semester  these classes may need to happen over the summer to truly be successful.  It always amazes me how some girls show up for rush in outfits and make-up that would be more appropriate in a  Vegas “Gentleman’s Club” than my sorority house.   As for honorary members, I doubt any respectable Sigma Chi would date an honorary DG.   Girls, you may need to settle for a lower tier house and lifestyle.
I think it’s important to remember here that these are national organizations. The USC chapters can’t just disregard that and take on “honorary”members.  And if these honorary members only get invited to mixers and invites, what is the purpose of having them? They don’t have to do any work but still get to go out and party? I can assure you that chapter is not a highly sought after exclusive part of greek life. If a girl wants to party with frats, she is free to do that every weekend on the row letters or no letters. If a house doesn’t invite a girl back, then they didn’t really want her. Period. There’s no need to have honorary members. What would that even say to girls? Sorry, you weren’t good enough to be a real XYZ but I guess you’re alright. Would more girls get bids if they were willing to accept bids from less popular houses? YES. Not every house at USC is at total right now AND there’s another sorority colonizing next fall. There is room for more girls to take part in greek life, some of them simply choose to not take some of those options.

USC researchers have found a correlation between recreational marijuana use and the possibility of getting specific types of testicular cancer, according to a study published online on Monday.
The study, published in the American Cancer Society’s journal, cautioned that therapeutic use of marijuana by young men could possibly result in a higher risk of getting testicular germ cells. The study came about because of a steady increase in the frequency of testicular germ cell tumors during the past few decades.
Victoria Cortessis, an assistant professor of preventive medicine, compared the self-reported recreational drug use of 163 young men with testicular cancer with that of 292 healthy men. Those with a history of using marijuana were twice as likely to have subtypes of cancer that tend to occur in young men and have a worse prognosis.
“We do not know what marijuana triggers in the testis that may lead to carcinogenesis,” Cortessis said in a press release. “Although, we speculate that it may be acting through the endocannabinoid system—the cellular network that responds to the active ingredient in marijuana—since this system has been shown to be important in the formation of sperm.”
“USC researchers have found a correlation between recreational marijuana use and the possibility of getting specific types of testicular cancer”
This correlation is not a new find. There are many published papers on the topic. Shockingly, none of them have been published in top journals because unfortunately there are always so many holes in the papers.

Vintage is unstoppable. From daily life to the red carpet this trend is dominating the scenes. It’s everywhere: high-wasted shorts, sunglasses, sweaters with logos and floor length dresses. Vintage differentiates itself from other trends, however, as it is a skill to find it and wear it well.
For a more hands on approach, spend some time visiting markets — a fantastic way to find vintage. While searching through mounds of unique articles, you will be sure to leave with a sense of real satisfaction and achievement. A show-stopping flea market would have to be Melrose Trading Post, which is located in Hollywood. Their vintage clothes and accessories are fantastic and also if you are still decorating your apartment, their vintage furniture is super affordable and unique.
This is all very time consuming, however, and due to our busy schedules here are a few short cuts.
Wasteland, a one of a kind store in Los Angeles, Santa Monica and San Francisco, should be your first stop. From vintage Chanel to modern designers such as Prada and Alexander McQueen, Wasteland will not fail to delight you.
Urban Outfitters is also a great place to find vintage clothing. Their vintage collection includes Esprit leather backpacks to LA Gear windbreakers with even a little bit of YSL mixed in. Not all their clothing is true vintage and in turn much more affordable, so I guess you could say it’s our dirty little cheat spot.
We all know that wearing the same outfit as another at a party is never a pleasant experience, and one of the many blessings of vintage is that will never happen. So with all this in mind, go out there and find the vintage. Looking different is always the most intriguing option.

So far this season, the Women of Troy have been prone to giving up goals immediately after they score. But on Sunday night, it was USC (2-3-1) who responded quickly against Cal State-Northridge after letting up a score in the 73rd minute to break a three-game losing streak and salvage a tie on the road against their local rivals.
Senior midfielder Samantha Johnson didn’t start for the first time this season thanks to a nagging foot injury, but she came in during the second half and scored in the 74th minute to even the score against the Matadors (3-1-3).
The score stayed even through regulation and two ten-minute overtime periods, and the match ended in a tie despite a stark difference in possession that favored USC.
The Women of Troy had 24 shots in the game compared to the Matadors’ 10, including a 17-4 shot advantage in the final 65 minutes after halftime.
“All of us really wanted to get the win, but I’m just happy we’re moving up instead of getting losses,” Johnson said. “We all committed ourselves to the 1-on-1 defending and just really had each other’s back in recovering on defense.”
The Matadors were kept in the game by last year’s Big West Goalkeeper of the Year, senior Cynthia Jacobo, who recorded 15 saves on the night. USC goalie Caroline Stanley, on the other hand, was rarely tested and recorded just one save.
“I thought we played our best game of the year, ” said USC coach Ali Khosroshahin. “We were able to take care of the ball tonight. When you keep possession of the ball, you limit the chances for the opposition.”
But Northridge did manage to break through first when a long ball into the box found the head of forward Brittanie Sakajian, who out-jumped Stanley to put the Matadors ahead.
“They just got around us when they played the ball in,” Khosroshahin said. “Caroline was trying to be a little more aggressive off her line and she just got beat.”
But the lead didn’t even last for two minutes. Johnson, who’s been wearing a boot when she’s not playing, outraced a Matador defender to a ball deep in Northridge territory and unleashed a powerful shot that forced a diving save from Jacobo.
On the ensuing corner kick, junior midfielder Jordan Marada put a ball into the box that got kicked out to Johnson, who launched it through a cluster of Matadors into the back of the net.
“[Johnson] did well for us after not playing at all in the first half,” Khosroshahin said. “Then she came into the second half and didn’t come off again. She definitely made a difference in our attack.”
Back-to-back corners in the 84th and 85th minute gave the Women of Troy two more chances in the waning moments of regulations, but a header from freshman defender Marlee Carrillo was saved by Jacobo and a shot from freshman forward Katie Johnson was blocked by the Matador defense. Two more shots from Samantha Johnson and Carrillo were turned away by Jacobo in the 90th minute to send it into overtime.
“I thought we had a lot of great opportunities in the game, but their keeper made some fantastic saves,” Khosroshahin said.
Samantha Johnson had a chance to get her second goal of the game in the 107th minute, but her shot was knocked wide once again by Jacobo.
That would be the final opportunity of the game, wrapping up a 1-1 tie. USC now owns a 4-0-1 record against Northridge.
“I think tonight was our best possession play, we really kept the ball a lot and tried to limit their long balls,” Johnson said. “We tried to set the tone rather than adjust to the other team.”
The Women of Troy will try to nab their first win since August 24 this Friday on the road at San Diego (3-5-0), who beat USC 2-1 on September 2. They then return home on Sunday against Portland (4-1-1) in their final nonconference match before Pac-12 play starts up.
