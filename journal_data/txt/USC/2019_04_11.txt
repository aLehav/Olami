Opening with footage of Doheny Library, there is no question that last week’s “Saturday Night Live” skit titled “College Admissions,” which was cut from the on-air broadcast but published online, was a parody on the noted inconsistencies that lie within USC’s college admissions process.
In the skit, after a character who appears to be former USC senior athletics official Donna Heinel (played by cast member Aidy Bryant) persuades the admission team to admit two academically underqualified rowers, actress Sandra Oh asks: “Do you ever feel like we’re admitting too many Asian students?” The jab at affirmative action initiates laughter in the studio. From bribery to misused affirmative action, the skit highlights all the possible loopholes and biases that have plagued the admissions processes for universities.
What’s worse is that this skit could very well be a reflection of what goes on behind closed doors. The line drawn between parody and reality is muddled because the admissions process is so secretive. These characters seem to be extreme cases, but as Heinel proved, admissions-related corruption did fly under the radar at USC. 
USC needs to clearly define what a “holistic review” of applications entails. At the very least, the University should detail what factors the USC admissions team values and how these factors play into the profile of an exceptional candidate.
The USC Admission page states that the admissions team “[conducts] a comprehensive, holistic review of [applications] to consider academic and personal characteristics.” 
“Holistic” is vague. “Characteristics” is vague. The first step to increasing transparency is to clarify the language used in the admissions process. 
USC Admission can expand this statement in the form of a rubric — identifying which characteristics are most highly valued and looking into how officers assess each students’ “performance in school, the rigor of your program, writing skills and test scores … personal qualities, as revealed in community involvement, leadership and achievements.”
Another solution is to provide examples of anonymous students who have been admitted and detailed descriptions of what made them exceptional. When pushed to explain what about candidates made them stand out, officers will have to tighten their language, rather than simply “liking [candidates] a lot,” as the characters on “SNL” did.
USC does disclose its matriculated student profiles — average GPAs, test scores and high schools are all available for prospective students to scour and compare. But this is not the same as an individual profile — two students with the same GPAs and test scores may have differing admissions decisions, and on the surface, it would be difficult to identify what made one stand out more than the other. 
If USC released anonymous profiles with extracurricular lists, sample essays and leadership roles come every admissions cycle, the admissions process would be held to a more consistent standard and therefore provide prospective students a better look into what makes a Trojan.
Some may argue that releasing these “student profiles” cultivates a mindset of score-oriented academic achievement. But sites like College Confidential, Reddit and Quora are already filled with the same kinds of deliberations. If a university provided individual anonymous profiles, admissions forum debates now have more accurate examples of what admissions teams are looking for.
While the USC Admission blog highlights communities on campus like Questbridge scholars and the University’s Multicultural Recruitment Team, there isn’t much discussion on what grants a particular student admission and how the admissions team conducts the “holistic review” process.
Early blog posts, like one from 2011 titled “Quality, not Quantity,” identify that “a great letter of recommendation provides insight into the personal and academic character of a student.” 
However, the post doesn’t explain how this factor is weighed against others considered in the application.
Comedy is comedy. It’s absurd, it’s extreme and it’s created for the sake of a good laugh. “SNL” writers likely have no idea what goes on in USC Admission deliberations, but that’s exactly the problem. The admissions process lacks transparency, and when a scandal forces corruption out of the deliberation room and into the limelight, comedy skits prove to be not so extreme after all. Students need definable goals, and admission to USC is proving to not have clear expectations.

Approximately 40 students, faculty and staff on Wednesday night attended a panel discussion at Bridge Hall about women’s involvement in the political sphere. The event, hosted by The Female Quotient, a female-owned business dedicated to advancing gender equality in the workplace, focused on encouraging women to participate in civic engagement and activism. 
“[I want to] lift up the stories of people who are typically underrepresented: women, women of color,” said event moderator Jaime Woo, a graduate student in the Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism. “All of the people here, all of the women here today can … channel [powerful] energy.”
Woo also co-wrote “Yes She Can,” which centers on the 10 young women who worked in the Obama administration. The book came to be recognized on The New York Times’ best-selling list. 
Ignite, a nonpartisan organization that aims to empower women in politics, also co-sponsored the panel, which included Ignite leaders Gabriela Meza, a senior at UCLA, Lily Larsen, a freshman at Santa Monica College, and Mai Mizuno, a senior majoring in international relations and philosophy, politics and law at USC.
The panelists discussed what motivated each of them to get involved in the political sphere and what served as the impetus for their interest in activism.
Larsen, who grew up in Mid-City, Los Angeles, said her drive to serve in local politics stemmed from witnessing her friends face issues with law enforcement due to the lack of youth engagement programs.
“There really is a lack of opportunity in a lot of Los Angeles neighborhoods,” said Larsen, who is planning to run for Los Angeles City Council in 2020.
Meza, a first-generation immigrant from Mexico, said she was motivated to pursue politics after hearing President Donald Trump’s anti-immigrant rhetoric. 
“I had to make this journey across the border to come for my education and everything [while] he’s out here calling us criminals, calling us all of these things right as he announced his campaign,” Meza said.
Mizuno said the 2016 presidential election prompted her to take a more active role in politics by getting involved in advocacy work around issues like educating youth about complex political issues like climate change.
“Now, our generation has to take charge,” Mizuno said. “There’s no one else doing it really or, at least, they’re not representing our interests.” 
Meza said that after the election, she realized she could not give up on her activist efforts since Trump’s win posed a threat to the rights of people within the immigrant community.
“In that moment, I thought, ‘Now it’s real,’” Meza said. “Now, I really can’t give up on this organizing and Ignite or anything like that … [because] it’s really going to affect us in a different way, especially me and my community.”
The panelists said they hope the work of Ignite and other organizations in grassroots movements, and community engagement will help create cultural change across the country and achieve equality for all. 
“It’s also about societal change and creating our own systems,” Meza said. “It’s really about breaking down those barriers of respectability as well, so we can fill that pipeline with all sorts of people.”
Meza said the societal barriers set in place restrict women of color from advocating for change, which can be especially tiring in the field of activism work.
“It’s exhausting,” Meza said. “You’re dealing with these systemic issues at the same time where you’re trying to fight them.”
When the panel opened up to questions from the audience, recent USC graduate Lynn Wang asked how to deal with issues like sexism and racism within advocacy organizations. 
“Whenever [problematic behavior] comes up, I try and have an honest conversation with the people, especially if they’re on my own team, about why we have to continue to learn,” Mizuno said. “Even for me, every single activist space is really a learning process.”

Low-income communities of color most often suffer the burdens of hazardous sites leading to adverse health effects like asthma, two environmental community advocates said during the “Environmental (In)justice Forum” hosted by USC Kinetic Wednesday.
Nearly 30 people attended the event, which focused on the intersections between pollution and discrimination. Speakers included Hugo Garcia, campaign coordinator of “People Not Pozos” (people not oil wells), and Lizette Hernandez, the current director of health and environment programs at Physicians for Social Responsibility Los Angeles. 
Hernandez said the inequity is in many ways an effect of redlining, a discriminatory and racist practice in banking and real estate that kept minorities out of certain neighborhoods. 
Manufacturing plants that released toxic chemicals into the environment were often built in these majority minority neighborhoods, Hernandez said. After living in one of these neighborhoods growing up, she said her son developed asthma.
PSR-LA created an interactive map that can tell members of South and Southeast L.A. if they live within 500 feet of a hazardous site. 
“One of the main things we want you to walk away with [tonight] is the different layers of oppression that exist on a daily basis,” Hernandez said. “Environmental justice came from black and brown communities who saw [that] there’s a reason why they are living next to toxic sites and there’s a reason others aren’t.”
After growing up in South L.A., Hernandez went off to college and thought she would never move back to her home city. But during the L.A. riots of 1992, she realized she needed to return to help change the issues she grew up with.
“I had a commitment to my community, and I was going to come back to share the skills and address the challenges,” Hernandez said. 
The USC Kinetic presenters also discussed NIMBY-ism, an acronym for Not In My Backyard, which refers to people who oppose any development near their residence, but can tolerate it when placed somewhere else. This rationale can lead to potentially harmful land use projects being built in communities that lack the resources or influence to fight back, said USC Kinetic Vice President Keala Rusher, a senior majoring international relations global business.
Garcia previously helped on a 15-year campaign to stop the 710 freeway extension and tunnel. If the campaign had not been successful, the project would have negatively impacted the South Pasadena communities that Caltrans planned to build the freeway through, Garcia said. 
Garcia added that small-scale community organizing and activism is vital in these cases in order to produce real change. 
“It’s going to take just going out and hardcore organizing in your community,” he said. “Somebody’s gotta knock on doors.”
Katherine Yang, a freshman majoring in media arts and practice, said environmental justice remains important not only in the context of global issues like climate change, but also in smaller scale issues, where the intersectional elements of disadvantage are more clearly seen.
“There is something to be said when the Woolsey fire victims … can raise a million dollars in one night, [but] we can barely raise $1 million among ourselves in one year,” Hernandez said. “This is what systemic racism and classism looks like.”

The Department of Public Safety responded early Wednesday morning to a fire-related incident at Bovard Auditorium. This was the third in a series of similar incidents reported in the building in the last three weeks. 
According to DPS crime logs, a custodian reported at 12:23 a.m. that a suspect spread hand sanitizer on a bathroom counter and used a burning paper towel to set it on fire. 
The incident comes after two reports near 4 a.m. on March 26 and 27 that detail nearly identical incidents. According to DPS Sergeant Steve Alegre, the same custodian reported the incident all three times. 
Alegre said DPS is waiting on confirmation for the time frame during which the suspect gained access to the building. He estimated that the most recent incident occurred some time between 6 p.m. and 10 p.m., after most employees had left the building and before custodians arrived to begin cleaning. 
“Fortunately, there’s been very minimal damage,” Alegre said during an interview at the scene. “But nonetheless, it’s been the same method of operation.”
A “Be on the Lookout,” or BOLO, alert was issued to DPS officers, according to Alegre. He said that as of near 1 a.m. Wednesday, surveillance operators were reviewing security footage to confirm whether the suspect was the same in all three instances. 
Though the crime log detailed burnt hand sanitizer and paper towels on the bathroom counter, Alegre said there was also a line of napkins across the floor that had been partially ignited.
“Some [napkins] have burned, and then there’s a long line of them across the floor,” Alegre said. “I think his intention was to burn [some that] did not ignite, but some did.”  
Alegre’s suggestion for DPS moving forward is to surveil the building between the hours of 6 p.m. and 10 p.m., but he said he is not sure whether that surveillance would be possible all seven days of the week.
“One of my recommendations would be to put undercover people [at Bovard] and watch for that,” Alegre said. “And when a particular individual walks in that door and heads to that bathroom, see what we can find.”

Ivana Giang sits in her living room in front of a wall of postcards that read “#RESIST,” “justice” and “Don’t Tear Families Apart.” She recalls sleepless nights, lots of tears, and the occasional moment of feeling stupid in class — but she just can’t seem to stop smiling.
It’s all part of the journey, said Giang, a graduating senior — a journey that has included advocating for diversity in student government, competitive dancing and learning more than she could have ever imagined. 
And that journey is almost over. Selected from a pool of Class of 2019’s most accomplished students, Giang will deliver the valedictory address at USC’s 136th commencement ceremony on May 10. Luckily, she’s never been afraid of an audience.
The daughter of two Vietnamese refugees, Giang graduated from Lakota East High School in Liberty Township, Ohio. She and her best friend — two of five Asian American students in a graduating class of 600 — were the salutatorian and valedictorian, respectively. 
“I think growing up with those social forces forced me to really focus on school and studying,” Giang said. “That was really important to my parents, and that was something that was carved out for me in terms of [my] social role in high school as an Asian American.”
Giang, who is set to graduate with a dual degree in public policy and global studies, was originally accepted to USC for journalism — a field she wanted to pursue after she joined her high school’s newspaper in ninth grade.
But before she even stepped foot on campus, Giang decided journalism was not for her.
“I think [journalism] is a job for other folks who are more talented in that [field],” Giang said. “I wanted to take a side and fight.”
That’s exactly what she did in her next four years at USC. As a freshman, Giang joined the Undergraduate Student Government Diversity Affairs Committee and went on to serve as the committee’s assistant director her sophomore year.
Later, as co-chief diversity officer — a position she helped create — Giang pushed for cultural sensitivity training, advocated for support for victims of sexual assault and held a town hall for students to discuss the lack of resources for cultural centers on campus. 
From her time on USG, Giang began to acknowledge and embrace her own identity as a first-generation Asian American for the first time. Despite her own distinct challenges, she realized she enjoyed certain privileges separate from many of her black and brown classmates, and she grew determined to bolster the voices of others. 
But as she was working to help other students, Giang came to realize that she was one of the people she had been fighting for.
“I was also sexually assaulted at a party in the spring semester of my freshman year … and I didn’t register it until my junior year,” Giang said. 
According to the Department of Justice, female college students ages 18 to 24 are three times more likely to experience sexual violence. Like Giang, 80% of those women don’t end up reporting the incident to law enforcement.
“That was a really scary moment for me — to sit there and think, ‘I have advocated for better resources for sexual assault for the past three years on campus, and I didn’t stop to think that I was the one in four women that they always talk about,’” she said.

Dance dance revolution
At the end of every fall semester, Korean American Student Association chapters throughout Southern California come together to compete in the KASA Freshman Dance-Off. Giang joined the competition after seeing a flyer in her freshman dorm, and her decision to perform came to shape the rest of her college experience. It also introduced her to many of her closest friends. 
The competition accepts all freshmen regardless of prior experience, which was fitting for Giang, who had none. She was looking for a way to step outside of her comfort zone in college, and hip-hop dance seemed like the perfect opportunity.
After dance-off, she joined Chaotic 3, a competitive hip-hop group on campus. She spent four semesters practicing over 10 hours a week and competing regularly — the perfect foil to her busy academic schedule.
“I realized that I can have this confidence, and nobody has to know what I do in the classroom,” Giang said. “I’m just performing with these people that I love.”
After studying in Nicaragua the spring semester of her junior year, she returned to campus and joined NSQK, a non-competitive group formed by her friend Ten Francis, whom she met through KASA’s dance-off. 
“She’s always there to give it her all,” said Francis. “It’s one thing to ask someone to be there and do the moves, but it’s [another] thing for someone to put their soul into it.”
The queen’s speech
Since her freshman year, Giang has worked to achieve justice. Justice is what drives her passion for education reform, and it’s what inspired her current project on the history of racial segregation in public schools. 
“Ivana is unique in that she constantly has the big picture and the real world in her head,” said sociology professor Ann Owens, who is co-authoring the project with Giang. “She brings a lot of passion for issues around equality and diversity.”
For Giang, justice doesn’t just mean filling a quota. Justice, she says, means having the right to experience the beauty of everyday moments, whether that means dancing for the fun of it, sitting down for a family meal or attending a graduation ceremony after four years of hard work. 
And when she speaks to thousands of her classmates and their families a month from now, she wants to use the opportunity to unite the community she has come to know and love. 
“I will always be the first person to put myself out there, to make myself vulnerable, to try to say that I don’t have it all figured out,” Giang said. “I still have a lot to learn about myself and about everybody around me, so let’s do this together.”

Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti will be  the keynote speaker for the 2019 baccalaureate ceremony for USC degree candidates and families, USC announced.
The ceremony will take place at 5 p.m. May 9 at Bovard Auditorium, followed by the baccalaureate dinner at 6:30 p.m. on Pardee Way.
“I’m delighted that the mayor has accepted our invitation to address our graduating students and their families at baccalaureate,” Interim President Wanda Austin wrote in a statement to the Daily Trojan. “Mayor Garcetti is a champion of education and believes, like I do, that higher-ed plays an important and integral role in social and economic mobility.”
Garcetti, a fourth-generation Angeleno, was elected as the 42nd mayor of L.A. in 2013. He is the city’s first Jewish mayor and the youngest elected mayor in history. Before his election to the Los Angeles City Council in 2001, Garcetti was a visiting instructor of international relations at USC and formerly served on the California board of the Human Rights Watch.
Garcetti recently spoke at the Climate Forward: Navigating the Politics of Climate Change conference on April 4. The conference brought together leaders from across the world at USC to discuss climate policy and international cooperation, including former British Prime Minister Gordon Brown and former Secretary of State John Kerry, climate change and policy solutions.
In December, Garcetti’s speech at an event commemorating the 70th anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights at Bovard was interrupted by demonstrators who criticized the mayor’s policies on homelessness and policing. The protest was organized by groups like Democratic Socialists of America and the L.A. Community Action Network.
“We all look forward to hearing his words of inspiration and guidance, as we send our newest class of Trojans off to make their way in the world,” Austin wrote.
According to USC News, over 18,700 degrees will be awarded this academic year during the commencement ceremony. The main ceremony will take place in Alumni Park and the various satellite locations across the University Park and Health Sciences campuses. 
U.S. Representative and Vice-Chair of the Black Congressional Caucus Karen Bass will deliver the keynote speech at commencement.

The USC women’s basketball team is losing a team leader in junior point guard Minyon Moore, who announced her intention to transfer this week. Moore led USC in the 2018-19 season in rebounds, assists and steals and finished second on the team in points with an average of 14.8 per game.
Moore gave no public indication of her preferred transfer destination, but she thanked USC for her time as a Trojan in a statement on Instagram.
“All I can say is what a ride,” Moore wrote. “After thorough consideration about my future, my family and I have decided that it’s best for me to continue my basketball and academic career as a graduate transfer at a different University. I want to thank the USC Trojan family for making these past three years, ones I will hold dear to my heart for the rest of my life #Trojan4life Thank you.”
Moore was named to the Pac-12 All-Freshman Team in her first season as a Trojan, and earned Pac-12 All-Defensive Team honors in her sophomore year.
Moore’s departure may be due in part to that of her sister, Mariya, who transferred to USC from Louisville for her senior season last year.
