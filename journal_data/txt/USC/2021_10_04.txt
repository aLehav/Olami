For most people during the pandemic, retirement parties were small events, sparsely attended by friends and colleagues. But when Michael “Mick” Dalrymple announced his resignation as the director of university sustainability practices at Arizona State University, it was different: With social distancing guidelines in place, people showed up.
“He’s so beloved at the university,” said Lauren Kuby, Dalrymple’s former colleague who serves as the manager of events and community outreach for the Global Institute of Sustainability and Innovation at ASU. “He’s just the epitome of leadership in the sustainability world.” 
Dalrymple has 20 years of experience in the sustainability field and worked for over six years at Arizona State, where his sustainability leadership helped the university achieve carbon neutrality in 2019 — six years ahead of schedule. 
Now, as USC plans for carbon neutrality and a reduction in single use plastics, the University hired Dalrymple in late July as its first chief sustainability officer. Dalrymple joins the administration’s efforts in formulating its upcoming Sustainability Plan. The report, set to be published in early Spring 2022, will outline USC’s plans for grappling with the ongoing California drought, shifting to sustainable energy sourcing and achieving zero waste, among other goals. 
Initiatives Dalrymple helped actualize at ASU included replacing 2,000 plumbing fixtures to reduce water usage and transforming landscaping design by including native plants instead of grass. He also assisted with coordinating energy conservation efforts such as retrofitting buildings with efficient lighting and designing more sustainable buildings. 
Climate neutrality was achieved through a combination of energy efficiency, renewable energy and carbon offsets. For its renewable energy efforts, ASU made use of on-site solar generation as well as renewable energy purchases from large-scale, off-site generation facilities. Carbon offsets came in the form of local tree plantings and market offsets. 
Dalrymple said similar efforts are already underway at USC, with more than 1,000 faucets replaced to minimize water consumption as well as motors and pumps changed to reduce energy use in campus buildings.
Corey Hawkey, ASU interim director for university sustainability practices, worked directly under Dalrymple and collaborated with him on a variety of projects such as strategic planning, climate resilience and the ASU Carbon Project, which launched in June 2018 and generates offsets for the school’s carbon emissions. 
“Mick is extremely passionate and dedicated to the solutions to climate change,” wrote Hawkey in a statement to the Daily Trojan. “I am excited for Mick and USC — I know USC will continue to expand its commitment to sustainability under his leadership.”
Kuby said Dalrymple brings a wealth of multidisciplinary experience to his new position. Kuby first met Dalrymple while working on ASU’s Energize Phoenix Project, an initiative that increased energy efficiency and successfully retrofitted campus buildings for energy conservation.
Kuby worked with Dalrymple all throughout his term as the head of the Office of Sustainability Practices. Proud of ASU’s recent rank as the country’s most innovative university by US News for the seventh consecutive year, she attributes the accomplishment, in part, to Dalrymple’s work. 
“He just epitomizes innovation and perseverance,” Kuby said. “He’s someone who’s passionate about sustainability. He’s been an entrepreneur, he’s been a screenwriter and he’s been somebody who built leadership throughout the university on sustainability practices and principles. He’s kind of a renaissance man of sustainability.”
In 2004, Dalrymple installed solar panels on his house. Eight years later, the panels paid themselves off and have generated “free” electricity ever since. When utility companies raised power rates over the years, he didn’t feel the effect. That’s what Dalrymple said is most rewarding about sustainability work: the positive feedback loops of green investments and actions. 
“If you save energy, you’re saving water at the same time because there’s a lot of water that’s used to make energy,” he said. “Then there’s a lot of energy that’s used to treat water and to move water around.”
For Dalrymple, sustainability is more than saving money and living healthier: It’s about feeling more in line with and connected to the planet. 
Kuby said she is excited to see the progress Dalrymple will facilitate and believes USC can achieve even greater sustainability success than ASU, as California has a culture more accepting of renewables and sustainability than Arizona. 
In his role as chief sustainability officer, Dalrymple will report to David Wright, the senior vice president of the administration. For Wright, Dalrymple’s hiring couldn’t have come at a better time. 
“Mick is the right person at the right time to build on USC’s sustainability efforts, mobilize our campus communities and ensure President Folt’s vision is realized,” wrote Wright in a statement to the Daily Trojan. “He brings inspired leadership to USC, and I’m confident he’ll make our 2028 sustainability goals a reality.”
The 2028 Sustainability Plan, currently in development, places Dalrymple in a key position to plan the logistics associated with incorporating sustainability into campus infrastructure and practices. 
The plan will also include a multitude of implications that exceed the year 2028. The administration is focused on ensuring the plan is thoroughly considered and manageable, while still pushing beyond what is comfortable for the University, Dalrymple said. 
The anticipated 2028 plan will be the second of its kind at USC following the launch of the campuswide sustainability program in 2015, when the 2020 Sustainability Plan was published. Dalrymple said he believes the new plan comes at a critical juncture, months after the publication of the Sixth Assessment Report by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. 
“The most important thing that we’re coming to a consensus on in terms of the world, not just USC, is that we are in a definite climate crisis that scientists [identified] in the recent [Sixth Assessment Report],” Dalrymple said. “[The report] paints a pretty daunting picture of what needs to be done.”
One major topic the plan will touch upon is the issue of water availability, which is especially pertinent with the current drought the National Integrated Drought Information System reported  affects 100% of Los Angeles County residents. Dalrymple said the water situation USC faces is comparable to that of ASU, with California and Arizona sharing a similarly hot, arid climate. 
“One of the things that we need to really look at more is the water situation, because, in a way, [USC] might be a little bit insulated from the [issue], but really we need to be doing our part to to account for the changes in precipitation that climate change is bringing, the ongoing mega drought and potential reductions in Colorado River water deliveries to Southern California,” he said.
Dalrymple said the University’s sustainability efforts have lacked a structured plan necessary to translate goals into tangible efforts that propel USC toward a green future. He said he sees his role as a “cheerleader” for the University’s ongoing and upcoming sustainability initiatives.
Grateful for the overwhelming amount of positive feedback and encouragement he’s received from the Trojan family about the necessity his changes will bring about on campus, Dalrymple feels prepared to fulfill the University’s sustainability goals.
“There’s a tremendous amount of work that still needs to be done,” Dalrymple said. “We want to make sure that the plan is right and that we thought it through.”

In 2005, Jessica Lall ran for Undergraduate Student Government president, navigated campus political dynamics, and learned how to create a politcal platform.
Now, Lall, who graduated in 2006, is running for Mayor of Los Angeles, using some lessons she learned in her campaign at USC, finding common ground and bringing people together.
Lall, a  former political science and social science major, declared her mayoral candidacy on Sept. 20, promising to tackle issues such as homelessness and climate change. Her announcement came a week before Karen Bass, another USC alumna and congressional representative of USC’s congressional district, declared her run for the position. 
“Los Angeles needs a new kind of leadership, leadership that’s fueled by creativity, inclusivity and action,” said Lall in an interview with the Daily Trojan. “I believe that I have a unique set of experiences in my career that prepare me to bring this type of leadership approach and change to our local government.”
In addition to serving as USG president, Lall interned for former California Sen. Barbara Boxer, served as the president of her sorority Delta Delta Delta and co-founded Youth Exploring Passion, a club which paired students from local schools with USC students who could help with academic work.
After graduation, Lall entered various government roles, such as senior policy director for the City of Los Angeles and executive director for the South Park Business Improvement District. 
Lall currently works as the president and CEO of the Central City Association of Los Angeles, an advocacy and lobbying organization that contributes to future development of the downtown L.A. region. Lall also serves on the USC Board of Governors for the 2021-2022 term.
In her first speech since announcing her candidacy, Lall emphasized her youth and her potential status as first female Mayor of Los Angeles. 
“I am here today to announce that I am running to not only become the next mayor of Los Angeles but the first female mayor of Los Angeles, the first digital native mayor of Los Angeles, a mayor who will build inclusive coalitions, invite new voices into the process enough for something different, something new to the communities that all serve in the city we all call home,” she said.
As student body president at USC, Lall said she worked toward creating the Steve Sample Campus Center and improving the Health Center.
Lall is running on addressing homelessness, a personal issue for her. In an interview on Fox 11, Lall said her brother passed away because of mental health conditions and addiction last year, which drives her commitment to solving the crisis. On her website, Lall has a seven-point plan to address the issue, including rapid rehousing, substance abuse programs, more housing and “not [tolerating] criminal activity that exploits the most vulnerable and makes our neighborhoods unsafe.”
“I think we do not need any more reports or analysis on this,” Lall said. “We really just need to put what we know needs to be done into action. And we need aggressive leadership that is consistent and informed to do that.”
In addition to homelessness, Lall said climate change, recovering from the pandemic and increasing wages are priorities in her campaign.
Although she does not currently hold public office, Lall said her outside perspective will help L.A.
“I’m not a career politician. So we’re going to not be running a traditional kind of campaign and that starts with being inclusive and not focusing so much on the political class but just your average Angeleno,” she said.
Lall’s father is an Indian immigrant and her mother is an Oklahoma-native. She grew up in Texas and England and came to L.A. when she entered high school. 
If elected, Lall would succeed current Mayor Eric Garcetti, who was nominated as United States Ambassador to India.
Lall said college voters will play a pivotal role in the mayoral election.
“They’re going to play a critical role in deciding who is the next mayor. I say get inspired, get involved, ask the hard questions, participate. And reclaim your own city government for what’s in the best interest of Angelenos,” she said.
Correction: A previous version of this article incorrectly stated that Lall was executive director for the City of Los Angeles and senior policy director for the South Park Business Improvement District. Lall was senior policy director for the City of Los Angeles and executive director for the South Park Business Improvement District. The Daily Trojan regrets this error.

There are a few facets of living in Los Angeles that are absolutely tragic, let’s be honest. Notably, these include traffic, pretentious people, gentrification and, most importantly, horrible bagels. If you have ever attempted to find a bagel worth your money near USC’s campus, you are certainly well aware of the fact that no such thing exists. This list is intended to broaden your horizons and demonstrate that, against all odds, there are a few good bagel spots in L.A.
Pop’s Bagels [Rating: 3/5] $$$
To begin our review, we will start with the worst of the bunch. Granted, this is a comprehensive list of all of the bagel spots in L.A. that are worth trying, but there is still a hierarchy and unfortunately, Pop’s Bagels sits at the bottom. This small chain seems so promising, with creative sandwiches and excellent marketing, you will think that you have hit the bagel jackpot. Unfortunately, the worst part about this place is, in fact, the bagels. Imagine the chewy cardboard-esque bagel component of a Bagel Bite, but a little chewier and a lot bigger. That is Pop’s Bagels for you. If you choose your sandwich wisely, you’ll be happy, but not elated by any means. Their food is acceptable, but do not go seek it out. 
New York Bagel and Deli [Rating: 3.5/5] $
Regardless of where you are from, everyone has their bagel spot. It is usually a mom-and-pop store with refrigerators of Odwalla juices, homemade cream cheese and the familiar smell of fresh bagels wafting through the air. They typically serve bagels that are not necessarily gourmet or even objectively great, but rather familiar tasting. Usually, they microwave their eggs and serve burnt coffee, but there’s nothing else quite like it. The nostalgia is the best facet of these spots and is what draws you in time and time again. If you find yourself in Santa Monica, stop at New York Bagel and Deli for a bagel that echoes this sensation. This spot boasts a wide variety of shmears and bagels — all served by smiling faces. It is nothing exceptional, but the lack of pretension is oftentimes exactly what the doctor ordered. 
Maury’s [Rating: 4/5] $$
Maury’s is basically the place you go to when you can’t find parking at Yeastie Boys, but it is also well worth a try. They serve traditional bagels with fresh whitefish or smoked salmon, and they have truly perfected the art. The bagels are slightly crispy and a little chewy, as they are made using a revolving oven. These simple, yet divine, creations are perfect for sandwiches or even simply schmear. Beware: You may find yourself returning here all too frequently because you will soon discover that their bagels are perfect every time. There are a lot of Maury’s fans in Silverlake, so make sure to go early so that your favorite bagel is not sold out! 
Yeastie Boys [Rating:  4/5] $$
Oh, Trojans. I know that each and every one of you has crawled out of bed, plagued by the Sunday scaries and barely survived the trek to Yeastie Boys. We collectively owe it to Yeastie Boys each time we successfully reach Monday morning. Their bagels are truly unmatched in terms of their greasy, gooey, healing goodness. They specialize in extravagant bagel sandwiches that will ruin all other hangover breakfasts for you. The bagel itself is not as good as some other places on this list, but when it is merely a vehicle for homemade shmear, lox and avocado. Does it really matter? This shop is actually a food truck and has quite a few locations across L.A. You’re never too far from your yeasty fix. Come for the bagels, but definitely stay for the toppings. 
Hank’s [Rating: 4.5/5] $$
If you are on TikTok, you have surely been following the strange food trends that have plagued the internet recently. Everyone and their mother is pickling, salting, meal prepping and even stirring Mayo into their rice. “Hank’s … a deli of sorts” in Burbank has been listening.
You want salted cucumbers? They’re famous for it. Pickled onions? Roger that. Perfectly smoked salmon? Duh. This is the most diverse location on the list, as they truly offer it all. To make matters much better, their bagels are actually amazing. They aren’t merely a sandwich shop; they are well versed in the bagel game and they’re doing an impeccable job. Whoever Hank is, he deserves a kiss. 
Courage Bagels [Rating: 5/5] $$$
At last, the star of our show today: Courage Bagels. If you have a phone and live in L.A., you have surely heard about Courage Bagels. It is a small, locally-owned shop and you can definitely tell, in all of the best ways, of course. There is no such thing as perfect, but a comparable term would be “Courage Bagels.” They could spit in my coffee, and I would thank them.
Their Montreal-style bagels are a gift from the heavens. They are perfectly crisp on the outside, even offering a “burnt” option for the die-hards, and soft and fluffy in the middle. Their location is quaint and charming, with menus handwritten on loose paper taped in the windows. The line outside is barely shorter than the line outside the GOLF store on launch day, but it is so beyond worth the wait. Get the open-faced tomato bagel. This bagel tastes like they individually placed each grain of salt to ensure that every bite is equally orgasmic. Stop reading, get in your car and go to Courage Bagels. Now.

Every fall activity is perfect for a budding romance, long-standing affair or friends with “tension.” There’s a crispness in the air that makes us joke quicker and move closer. That being said, it’s no secret that Los Angeles doesn’t exactly have the best fall weather. But it is possible to “DIY” that fall magic with just a little extra effort. 
Remember: what makes fall special is not the weather but the traditions. And under this mindset, L.A. may do fall the best. With Hollywood glamour at its core, L.A. knows how to put on a show. So if you’ve got a lab partner crush, Tinder hookup, cute boyfriend or best friend, there’s no need to wait for a mistletoe or Valentine’s day. The best time to fall for someone is in the fall, and here’s where it can happen: 
Hitting the Town: 
Haunted House
There is no better fall date than a haunted house. If you’re looking for an opportunity to bridge the physical gap between you and your Zoom crush, this is for sure the option for you. Your crush will be scared and your shoulder will be safe. It can’t get easier than that — L.A. is a city of entertainment and so it does this option the best. 
If you’re looking for an extra scary night and don’t mind a pricier ticket, “Delusion” might be your choice. This chilly event is hosted in an 1875 estate in Pomona and will give you a traditional haunted house experience with an L.A. twist. Though also pricey, my true Halloween lovers might have more fun at a night in attendance at Universal Studios Halloween Horror Nights. On a budget and looking for a less scary option? The Los Angeles Haunted Hayride hosted at Griffith Park could be your perfect October night. That is, if you end with a kiss. 
Pumpkin Patch
This one is for my day-date couples who prefer to chitchat about their hometowns and not scream. A pumpkin patch will have you breathing fresh air, holding hands and arguing over who can pick the best pumpkin. Tanaka Farms and Underwood Family Farms are great options that bring a full experience though they require a bit of a drive. Mr. Bones Pumpkin Patch is closer and will still have your crush smiling. The only catch with this date is you may be surrounded by kiddos. If you’re looking to avoid the “how many kids do you want” conversation this fall, perhaps this isn’t the date for you. 
Pumpkin Treat Crawl
Does your crush have a sweet tooth? If so, this is your date. Pack into the car and drive around to L.A.’s best bakeries and cheapest grocery stores. Create a haul of pumpkin-spiced delectables and bring them back to campus to have an autumnal picnic. Share your rankings over a hot cup of coffee under your favorite tree on campus. Associates Park, which is right across from the bookstore, offers a great spot for this date. Afterward, your crush will walk away thinking you were the sweetest treat. 
Staying At Home: 
Halloween Movie Night
Sometimes simplicity works best. Have your crush over for a fun night of binge-watching scary flicks and childhood favorites. “Halloweentown” (1998) and “Hocus Pocus” (1993) are great options if you want to take a trip down memory lane. Otherwise, “Halloween” (1978) and “Scream” (1996) are sure-fire options to raise your heart rate. Got some cooking skills to show off? Make them dinner! Can’t cook? No problem. Order some food in and have a true lazy movie night. If you’re lucky, they may just be too scared to go home at the end of the night. 
Pumpkin Carving Session
This may be the only date where it’s acceptable to break out your sharpest knives. Get your hands dirty and make some jack-o’-lanterns with your crush. This could be a perfect follow-up date if you chose to go to a pumpkin patch. If not, no worries. Pop over to Trader Joe’s and pick a pumpkin that calls to your creative side. 
All that’s left now is to ask your crush out! Pull them aside and show them you’ve done all the planning. The work is done and they just have to show up! Remember, there’s no need to set your sights on Feb. 14 when fall is the best kisser.

What do you get when you put a musical theater fanatic, long-time soccer player, fitness enthusiast and extreme sports traveler together in an apartment building off USC’s campus? A production company. 
When the pandemic first hit, students had to adjust to a new way of learning. For classes rooted in lectures and exams, this transition seemed easier. Students in more artistic and creation-based pathways, however, were hit with unprecedented challenges. 
For Kaleb Manske, a sophomore majoring in psychology and film and television production, he knew he wanted to move to Los Angeles in Spring 2021. He was looking for artistic roommates, specifically in music or film.
He happened to find two actors originally from Chicago — Jordan Rice and Alex Nimrod, both sophomores majoring in theater with an acting emphasis. Actors need opportunities to act, and filmmakers need opportunities to film — so apartment #4085 at the Lorenzo was like bringing honey to the honeybees.
One night, they met Maximus Jenkins, a sophomore majoring in narrative studies and cognitive science, and after a casual conversation while hanging out later, the three roommates said “Do you want to make films with us?” to Jenkins; 4085 Productions had its training wheels on. 
Making films during a global pandemic would seem like rocket science to many, but to these four, who always approach all of their work with an extreme passion for the craft and willingness to do absolutely anything, the constraints of the virus became a gift. 
“It was basically [Kaleb’s] homework to make films for this class,” said Alex Nimrod. “It was this sort of thing where Kaleb was given a week or two weeks to make a film, but one of the parameters were, you can only work with whoever you’re living with and you cannot leave your living space.” 
Evidently, the coronavirus put restrictions on the students at SCA, yet with roommates Rice and Nimrod, Manske had his winning cast right on the living room sofa.
“So, people are coming to this film festival, acting in these films with their parents or in their house, because it’s COVID,” Nimrod said. “Yet, we are in an apartment in L.A. with two actors that are literally dying to act and just do work, and so it became a thing that we were throwing 20 hours a week because we’re doing nothing, into these films trying to make them as good as possible. And then when we’d showcase them to the class, I mean, they got good responses.”
From a few views to now hundreds, 4085 was able to take the training wheels off and move exponentially toward building the corporate foundation of their company.  From delegating more defined roles on the executive team to roping in more students, and now working on film festivals and grant submissions, 4085 Productions is ready to cement themselves as the next big thing in Hollywood. 
“It doesn’t matter if you have experience with any film before,” Manske said. “If you are interested in just being on set and watching what’s going on, if you want to be a writer and have never written a script before, that’s what we’re trying to do with this expansion.” 
Their upcoming short film, “Ouch,” which will be released on Oct. 8 on 4085’s YouTube channel, is a story that touches on concepts such as addiction, mental health and other heavily stigmatized issues not only prevalent in the L. A. community but also in communities all around the world. 
All of the proceeds from the fundraiser tied to this project will  go to To Write Love On Her Arms , a nonprofit organization that aims to provide hope and resources to those struggling with depression, addiction, self-injury and suicide.
4085’s role doesn’t just stop there — despite having little to no funding — for every view that “Ouch” gets in the first 24 hours, 4085 will be matching it to $1 and donating it entirely to TWLOHA. 
So what’s next for 4085 Productions? Manske, Nimrod, Rice and Jenkins have the next seasons booked and in pre-production. Ideally, they’d like to take 4085 to the bigger stage and mirror successful production companies such as A24 while also developing their own niche or lack thereof. 
“I think what’s really cool about being a new production company is that we are not tied to any image … our first film was an action film, our second one explored sexual identity and then our third one did human connection,” Rice said. “Those things don’t have this underlying ‘We’re doing this type of film’ and that is what we love — that we’re telling these meaningful stories in whatever way we’re doing it, but the thing that does connect them together is that they’re meaningful stories that we just feel like need to be told.”
The company aims to highlight the stories of people who don’t feel they are capable of working in the film industry, according to Manske. For these people without much experience, 4085 productions attempts to make a process as “huge” and “daunting” as filmmaking inviting and meaningful.
Considering that this company has its foundation in friendship and innate passion for filmmaking, it’s clear that 4085 Productions has more than 4,085 days of diverse and creative storytelling in store for the future. 
“This is a pivotal moment for 4085, and if this is the first time you’ve heard about us, that’s wonderful. We want you,” Nimrod said.

Another week, another win for No. 1 men’s water polo: After claiming sole possession of the nation’s top rank, USC topped No. 6 Pacific 16-9 in a non-conference win at Uytengsu Aquatic Center. 
In their 11th straight win, the Trojans had a variety of scoring outputs. Redshirt junior driver Hannes Daube finished with a hat trick; fellow redshirt junior driver Ashworth Molthen and sophomore driver Carson Kranz each banged in two scores. 
At center stage, graduate student 2-meter Wyatt Barker, who played three seasons with the Tigers, ended with two steals and a hat trick on four shots.
“Playing against the old team and as competitive as we are … [I’m] always trying to do [my] best against the old boys,” Barker said. “[There was that] little extra edge for me this weekend.”
Redshirt senior driver Jacob Mercep, who only appeared on the scoreboard once, chipped in a pair of assists and one takeaway. Throughout the game, the lefty’s gravity soaked up most of the Tiger defense’s attention, and Mercep created constant opportunities for his teammates.
“That’s where the versatility of the game comes in,” Mercep said. “That’s what’s really important: If you don’t have a lot of space and other people are more open, then you need to give them that pass … to make it as easy as possible for them to score or put them in a successful position. And I’m happy anytime I can do that for my team.”
The Pacific offensive game plan was simple: Feed the center forward. USC countered with their signature high press from the opening sprint. The Trojans played with a controlled aggression,  forcing retreats and poor passes without picking up many exclusions. Pacific was forced to throw the ball around the perimeter for most of the first period, unable to break down the USC defense.
“They did well. They stayed in the press long enough,” Head Coach Marko Pintaric said. “We did [well] from that press into the zone to stop [Bogdan Djerkovic]. So, I’m actually happy the way they executed that.”
As the game continued, Pacific settled down into its offensive sets. In the second quarter, a few exclusions forced USC to drop deeper to cover the middle of the pool, allowing Pacific to move forward and initiate their offense closer to the goal. But senior goalie Nic Porter stayed calm and saved 9 shots.
“Nic Porter is the best goalie in the country hands down,” Barker said. “So regardless, he cleans up a lot of mistakes for us.”
Each time the Tigers threatened to turn it into a competitive game, the Trojans scored a pair and extended their lead. It was like a game of cat and mouse, with USC relenting and giving Pacific a glimmer of hope, only to stifle it with a few clinching goals. 
“It was the commitment to the tasks that we said we were going to execute,” Pintaric said. “We executed more than we didn’t … The score speaks for itself.”
USC will play its first MPSF conference game against UC Berkeley Saturday at 12 p.m.

Our right to a speedy trial is one of the most important rights protected by the Sixth Amendment of the United States Constitution. The amendment prevents indefinitely holding criminal defendants for unproven accusations, guarantees they receive a fair trial, ensures the effective utilization of resources and preserves the interest of the public, which includes the crime’s victims and witnesses. However, despite the 233 years since our Constitution’s ratification, we still don’t truly have the right to a speedy trial.
In Barker v. Wingo (1972), the Supreme Court unanimously upheld the right to a speedy trial — it cannot be established by rigid rules but rather on an ad hoc, or impromptu, basis between the prosecution and defendant’s conduct. 
I’d like to specifically highlight Justice Byron R. White’s concurring opinion in this case. While describing a speedy trial’s necessity in preventing unconstitutional infringement on the defendant’s liberty, he argued that case delays interfere with one’s life even if they are on bail – considering factors such as employment disruption, mental health deterioration and familial disruptions. Most importantly, he stated, “Unreasonable delay in run-of-the-mill criminal cases cannot be justified by simply asserting that the public resources provided by the State’s criminal-justice system are limited and that each case must await its turn.”
The state cannot compromise our right to a speedy trial because of “limited resources” and backlogs. We must pressure the state to resolve these cases and get people the trial dates they deserve. 
When it comes to backlogs in cases, Black and Indigenous communities and communities of color are disproportionately affected. Not only do these people account for more cases and receive longer sentences for the same misdemeanors, they are also more likely to spend time in pretrial confinement with higher bail amounts. With the staggering backlog of cases, the racial disparity within our justice system exponentially grows and these individuals remain guilty until proven innocent. 
More than three years after Torrance police officers killed her son in January 2018, Charmane Henderson, a Black mother from Hawthorne, Calif., is still waiting for her trial date. Diagnosed with stage two ovarian cancer, she is concerned that she may not even be able to testify as her health declines and the trial delay extends.
Officers killed Henderson’s son in 2018, two years before the start of the pandemic in the U.S. While the pandemic dramatically worsened the backlog of cases, it typically takes some California courts over 500 days to set a trial date. According to Lex Machina’s state court data collected between 2016 and 2021, “the median time to trial in Los Angeles County Superior Court was 467 days.” 
It’s impossible to ignore the pandemic’s impact on our justice system. But, as we recover and fully reopen our malls, schools and amusement parks, why are courtrooms still in limbo? According to CalMatters, 44,241 people are incarcerated without being convicted of a crime with most hearings still virtual or delayed. This excludes all the crime victims waiting for a trial date. Additionally, no one truly knows how many of these backlog cases resulted from the pandemic or carried over from before coronavirus. 
One would expect a greater push to solve the backlog as we recover from the pandemic and resources become more available. Staff shortages and unforeseen — otherwise unnecessary — budget reductions, however, have made this practically impossible. Even when a case makes it to trial, people still wait several months to receive money rewards from civil litigations, as reported by San Bernardino County Court officials.
“Without a substantial change, we are facing the very real possibility that it could take more than three years before some violent crimes make their way to trial and even longer for homicide cases,” said Mecklenburg County District Attorney Spencer Merriweather in a 2020 news release.
Over three years. Ridiculous. 
Instead of a greater push to send cases to trials, more and more courts are dropping cases. Meg Garvin, executive director of the National Crime Victim Law Institute at Lewis and Clark Law School, warns that dropping cases sends the message that these cases and the people involved do not matter — and she’s right. For old cases of misdemeanors without any victims, by all means, drop them and reallocate the resources for lawsuits such as Henderson’s. However, a lack of resources does not excuse unresolved cases. 
Denial and ignorance will not solve the problem. Any further case delays mean people are struggling against unproven criminal charges, stuck fighting for child support or are victims simply wanting closure and rectification. Waiting in this void of injustice, these people aren’t asking for much — they just want the justice they deserve.

Earlier this month, the Los Angeles Times reported fentanyl-laced cocaine circulating around the Los Angeles area. Fentanyl is a synthetic opioid that is 80 to 100 times stronger than morphine. According to the Drug Enforcement Agency, this powerful drug can be lethal in doses of as little as two milligrams compared to 200 milligrams for heroin. Drug dealers intentionally contaminate fentanyl with other drugs because of its low cost and potency, which results in fentanyl traces in other substances such as MDMA, or ecstasy and cocaine. 
Consequently, unassuming drug users — who are typically not addicts themselves — risk accidentally ingesting a lethal dose of fentanyl. In order to reduce that risk, student-run nonprofits, such as Trojan Awareness Combating Overdose, urge students to test drugs for fentanyl before consumption. 
TACO provides free fentanyl test strips and Narcan to reduce the risk of fentanyl overdose. Additionally, they partnered with Duffl Inc., a student-run convenience store delivery service, to deliver tests to students in under 10 minutes at $0.01 a strip, plus a delivery fee. 
The tests are simple to use. Users dip a test strip into a strawberry-seed-size product and water mix. Results come between 90 seconds and five minutes later. With such a simple way of preventing death, there is no reason the University cannot do more to ensure that no student overdoses on fentanyl. 
While these grassroots efforts are a good thing, not all students are aware of them. Fraternity members run Duffl, and TACO focuses its efforts on Frat Row. Specifically, members set up their stand on the Row every Friday afternoon where they hand out testing strips and TACO has been invited to give every house on the Row a presentation on harm reduction. However, substance abuse is a problem that extends beyond Greek life.
Alexis Areias, president of the Undergraduate Student Government, reached out to TACO to potentially include fentanyl testing strips in USC’s “wellness to-go vending machine” at King Hall. The vending machine provides contraceptives, but cheap fentanyl testing strips are only available via TACO and Duffl, and one can cost $1.96 with the delivery fee. This is a problem. 
While incredible for its academics, USC is a notorious party school where substance abuse occurs. By ignoring that fact, the University harms its students. Abstinence is not a viable solution to the problem of overdose, just as abstinence-only sex education is not an effective solution for teenage pregnancy. It is not reasonable for a university to just tell students to stop doing drugs because students will still do drugs regardless, as seen with the failure of the D.A.R.E. campaign. 
Currently, USC runs the Naloxone SC program, which provides an opioid overdose reversal training video with free fentanyl testing strips and Narcan-brand nasal spray to students who complete the training. While this program is a valid effort by the University, it is simply not enough. Students should not have to complete a training to receive free strips because it merely aids its inaccessibility. There must be a widespread effort to distribute them to everyone. 
Not to mention the fact that the University has shown concern for other public health crises. With mandatory coronavirus testing procedures, free condoms in student housing and full panel sexually transmitted infections testing at Engemann Student Health, there is no reason why USC should not do the same with the opioid epidemic. Drug overdoses among students have always been a problem — why has the University taken so long to address them? 
Providing free fentanyl testing strips is one way the University could promote harm reduction. USC does not require students to undergo sexual education training before using condoms. They could normalize fentanyl testing in the same way they normalized condoms with “Trojans Wear Condoms” buckets. 
There are still many barriers to safe drug use in the United States, as the stigma surrounding drugs continues to prevent education on harm reduction. Overdose is one of the leading causes of death in the country, with opioids responsible for over 70% of all drug-related deaths. USC must go beyond solely making fentanyl test strips more widespread in order to prevent more deaths.
