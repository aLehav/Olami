The Trojan Advocates for Political Progress held a rally and sit-in in front of Bovard Auditorium Thursday to protest the University’s opposition to AB 1510, a bill that would allow victims of former campus doctors George Tyndall and Dennis Kelly’s alleged sexual abuse to file lawsuits if their statute of limitations has run out. 
Nearly forty students sat outside Bovard with duct tape taped over their mouths to symbolize the University’s intent to silence students. They held signs that read “University of Sexual Criminals” and “USC Wants to SILENCE me”. 
“What this sit-in is designed to do is to draw attention to the fact that USC is actively silencing survivors,” TAPP President-elect Alex Kriksciun said. “USC often tries to bury these things under the rug [and] hide whatever nefarious things they’re doing.”
Victims of Tyndall and Kelly shared their testimonies in Hahn Plaza near Tommy Trojan. 
“I wanted [students] to have a face and a specific story … [and] for them to understand what this really meant and how it has devastated the lives of survivors,” said Mai Mizuno, a student and alleged victim of Tyndall who spoke at the rally. “This event serves as a reminder that this issue has not gone away, just like the trauma of our abuse has not gone away. Therefore, we will continue to stand together and knock loudly on the door of Bovard.”
Mizuno, a senior majoring in international relations and philosophy, politics and law, flew to Sacramento last weekend with other survivors to lobby California Assembly members to support the bill. 
The University hired lobbying firm Nielsen Merksamer Parrinello Gross and Leoni LLP to oppose AB 1510, which grants a one-year window so that sexual assault victims can seek claims, despite having passed the current statute of limitations of two to 10 years after the assault.
“In the eyes of the administrators, [victims] are no more than a potential legal settlement,” said Katherine Thanos, a junior majoring in law, history and culture who helped organize the rally and spoke at it. “[Victims] are no longer a member of the Trojan family, but a skeleton to be hidden in the closet.”
At the rally, protestors demanded the University to terminate its relationship with the lobbying firm and to match the amount of money spent on lobbying against AB 1510 to fund Relationship and Sexual Violence Prevention Services.  They also called for the University to release an apology to survivors and publicly acknowledge allegations against Kelly. 
The University has acknowledged the lawsuits against Kelly, but has not released a statement regarding an internal investigation into the allegations.
“We are aware of the lawsuit and are concerned by its allegations,” the University said in a statement. “We’re working to understand the facts of this matter. We care deeply about our entire Trojan family, including our LGBTQ+ community, and take this matter very seriously.”
“We are not going away just because it’s the last day of classes,” said Shany Ebadi, an organizer of the event and former Undergraduate Student Government co-chief diversity officer. “This is something that is a life or death struggle for a lot of people.”
Members of TAPP handed out flyers to students passing by, alerting them about AB 1510 and requesting them to call California senators to lobby for the bill. 
“USC is trying to protect themselves from consequences,” said Cameron Roper, a freshman majoring in narrative studies and cognitive sciences who attended the sit-in. “USC should be taking responsibility, they should be supporting [the bill].”

I’ve been a student journalist for over a third of my life. 
I’m almost 22 and I became a student journalist the year I turned 15, as a high school freshman who was very dumb and very shy and who did not know a damn thing about AP Style. Now I’m eight years older, maybe a little less dumb and shy, and I am completely and irrevocably the person I am today because of the newsrooms that have raised me.
Most of the time, I joke that I hate emotions. But senior year has this strange ability to turn anyone soft. Almost every day this week, I’ve bumped into an old friend on campus and almost began to cry over a random interaction. Every time I walk by Bovard, I feel a little twinge in my chest. Goodbyes are never easy, especially when they’re protracted, and the entirety of this year has felt like a long summation of goodbyes and lasts that are all culminating in the next two weeks.
My favorite piece of writing of all time (that’s a bold statement but I’m standing by it) is written, of course, by Rick Reilly, the immutable GOAT of sportswriting. It was supposed to be the last thing he ever wrote, a column called “Some truths I’ve discovered” that he published in 2014 when he thought he was hanging up his writing boots for good.
I’m no Rick Reilly, and I’m nowhere near the end of my writing career, but as I come the end of my years as a student journalist, I feel like I’ve learned a thing or two about this gig that I’d like to share. So, if you don’t mind, I’m gonna ask for a few more column inches and a few more seconds of your life to share some of my own truths.
If you want a cookie in the press box, grab it early. Journalists are monsters and will eat every scrap of free food in half the time of any other human.
Never get attached to the lede of your gamer. Just don’t do it. There will be an overtime or a last-minute equalizer, and then you’ll have to trash your darling intro to hurriedly type out something that will just never quite live up to the original.
There’s no writer’s block in the world that can’t be conquered by a late night walk across campus (or a dance break by Tomás Mier).
When you’re a senior and you meet a wide-eyed freshman, look closely. They probably look a lot like you did four years ago. Do yourself a favor and buy that kid a coffee, because they’ll be kicking ass in the real world right alongside you in a couple of years.
Talk to everyone. The sports information director, the backup kicker, the water polo captain. Talk to them all. Everyone has a story, and anyone might have the story, the one that makes you the best writer you can be.
You don’t need that third cup of coffee. Really. You don’t.
Good editors are hard to come by, and good friends even harder. If you find anyone who is able to be both, make sure you tell them they’re the best, even if it embarrasses them (yes, this one’s for you, Eric). 
There are lots of rules to writing. Break all of them. People will tell you that you shouldn’t start a feature with a quote, or that you can’t start a sentence with “and” or “but.” Sometimes they’re right, and sometimes they’re wrong, but the best way to figure out is to give it a try.
Under any facade of toughness, most hulking, ripped athletes are normally huge softies. Find a way to tap into that in any interview, and you’ll be golden.
Every story has the same focus, and we all write about the same thing. Sure, some people write about football and soccer, some about politics and arts. But at the end of the day, we’re all writing about people. That’s the only thing that matters. Everything else is just scores and stat sheets.
So there it is. My last column, and my last article published in a student newspaper. It’s bittersweet, the kind of goodbye I’ve been dreading and looking forward to for years now. I’m not sure what to say anymore, except one thing — thank you.
Thank you, to anyone who read what I had to say, to anyone who hated it or loved it. Thank you to every member of the Daily Trojan staff, and to every USC athlete who let me learn how to interview by asking them clunky or awkward questions. Thank you to that one dude who commented on a story that I needed to stop writing about sports and go back to watching Ellen DeGeneres and eating corn. Thank you to my mom for reading every, single thing I’ve ever written.
Goodbyes aren’t easy, but I’m thankful for this one. These eight years have been unforgettable, and because of them I know what my future will look like — full of sports and stories and, most importantly, the people who I have met here, who made every early morning road trip and late night deadline the best of my life.
