After a rough week at home for the USC women’s tennis team, it cashed in on a much needed road trip, beating Oregon (8-9, 1-2) and Washington State (10-9, 0-6).
“I am super proud of the girls,” USC coach Richard Gallien said. “They were very strong and confident. [Oregon and Washington State] are vastly improved and throw in the toughest travel you could have, it was a great trip.”
USC (13-5, 3-2) started the weekend with an easy 7-0 victory against the Ducks (8-9, 1-2) on Friday. Freshman Kaitlyn Christian and junior Alison Ramos highlighted the day with back-to-back wins to start singles play. Ramos took down Pascale Nuebert 6-0, 6-0 in the No. 4 spot, as Christian would then dispatch Julia Metzger 6-0, 6-1 in the next match out of the No. 2 spot.
Senior Maria Sanchez took down No. 116 Pavlina Smatova 7-5, 6-3 in what became one of the closer matches on the day. Right before Sanchez’ bout, senior Cristala Andrews fought off a tiebreaker in the first set to hand Trudie du Toit 7-6 (1), 6-3 defeat on court five.
Sophomore Danielle Lao, ranked No. 26 in the nation, rebounded from last week’s losses with wins against Oregon’s Patricia Skowronski (6-3, 6-3) and Elisabeth Fournire (6-0, 6-0) of Washington State on Saturday.
Senior Lyndsey Kinstler and freshman Hayley Miller each made rare appearances on the singles circuit this weekend to mixed results. Although Miller would fall 6-4, 6-1 to the Washington State’s Jessica Gomez, Kinstler made the most of her singles start by defeating Oregon’s Lana Buttner 2-6, 6-4, 7-5.
Against the Cougars, Sanchez had another tight contest on court one beating Luda Vasilieva 7-5, 3-6, 1-0 (13-11). Vasilieva took the nations’ top-ranked singles player into an uncommon three-set tiebreaker before finally falling after a back-and-forth final set.
Christian and Ramos continued their success against the Cougars, dispatching of Ksenia Googe (6-1, 6-3) and Andjela Kankaras (6-2, 6-1) on court three and four.
In No. 5 singles, Cristala Andrews fought off Olga Musilovich, 6-0, 3-6, 1-0 (10-6), recording her second win on the road trip.
Staying outside of California, USC will head to Tempe, then Tucson to continue Pac-10 play against Arizona State and Arizona, before returning home to face No. 6 UCLA at Marks Stadium.

Junior first baseman Ricky Oropesa can’t do it all himself, but that won’t stop him from trying.
The preseason All-American had seven RBIs over the weekend and took USC’s home run lead, adding his third long ball of the weekend Sunday at California’s Evans Diamond. But the Golden Bears took the series finale 9-6, giving them the series win.
Slugging · First baseman Ricky Oropesa, pictured here against UCLA, went 2-for-3 with a home run and two RBIs at the plate Sunday. The preseason All-American also hit two home runs against California on Friday. - Mannat Saini | Daily Trojan 
The Trojans (10-18, 2-4) took a 4-2 lead in the fifth inning on a two-run single by junior Matt Foat after Oropesa was intentionally walked with a pair of runners on base. The lead did not last long, however.
Cal (19-6, 5-1) responded with four runs. After a two-RBI double by Chadd Krist tied the game, Trojans’ senior starter Logan Odom had a chance to get out of the inning without any more damage. Odom induced what should have been an inning-ending ground ball, but freshman shortstop James Roberts committed an error, extending the inning.
Darrel Mathews took advantage, hitting a double down the line that scored another pair of runs and chased Odom from the game.
Oropesa’s home run trimmed the lead to 6-5 in the seventh inning, but Cal again responded, tacking on three runs in the bottom half of the inning.
The Trojans had one final chance in the ninth inning when they got the tying run to the plate, following a RBI double by senior Joe De Pinto. With a pair of runners on, junior Brandon Garcia couldn’t add his third hit of the day, grounding out to shortstop to end the game.
The Trojans racked up 14 hits on the day with every batter in the lineup knocking at least one hit, but USC left nine runners on base. Odom was charged with the loss after allowing six hits and six runs, only three earned, in four and two-thirds innings.
USC took the series opener Friday night using a consistent offensive attack. The Trojans scored in seven of their nine at-bats as they put 10 runs on the scoreboard for the first time this season.
Oropesa led the way with a pair of two-run home runs to right field. His second long ball gave the Trojans a 5-0 lead, but the Golden Bears struck back with five runs in their half of the fifth inning.
The next inning, Oropesa put USC ahead for good with a RBI single to tie a career high of five RBIs. Sophomore infielder Adam Landecker also tied a career high with three RBIs.
Freshman Bobby Wheatley picked up the win in relief.
Cal bounced back Saturday with a 9-2 win, getting to USC junior starter Austin Wood for six runs in the first inning. The Golden Bears batted through the lineup, chasing Wood before he even pitched a complete inning. In his worst outing of the season, Wood allowed six runs, four earned, on four hits, with two hit batsmen.
The Trojans never threatened as Cal starter Justin Jones, a freshman All-American last season, threw a complete-game seven-hitter. Three of those hits came from junior outfielder Garret Houts, who boosted his batting average to .345 after the performance.
USC returns to action Tuesday when it hosts Loyola Marymount at 3 p.m. at Dedeaux Field.

In a rematch of last year’s NCAA championship game, No. 1 Stanford defeated the No. 3 USC women’s water polo team at McDonald’s Swim Stadium in double overtime Saturday.
With a final score of 9-8, the Cardinal (19-0, 4-0) broke the Women of Troy’s 23-game win streak at home after six intense periods of play.
“Obviously I’m really disappointed and upset that we didn’t come out on top,” said senior driver Joelle Bekhazi. “We worked hard all the way to the end. It was kind of like a roller coaster ride and that’s what we need to fix in the future.”
The Women of Troy (15-4, 3-2) started off the game strong, scoring four goals to Stanford’s one in the first period. Stanford came powering back, however, and the game was tied at six heading into the final quarter of regulation.
Stanford scored two goals quickly to start off the fourth period, but the Women of Troy found a way to tie it up in the last two minutes, as junior driver Nadia Dan scored her third goal of the day and senior two-meter Kristen Dronberger added a last-minute goal to even the score at 7-7.
“The biggest concern we had from them [Stanford] was their counterattack,” said USC coach Jovan Vavic. “They go fast, they anticipate, they get the ball in the hands of dangerous players. If you’re not prepared for that, that’s how they win games. In the first quarter, we did a good job of that, and in the fourth too. But not in the second or third.”
The two teams continued to battle in overtime, until Stanford scored with 1:25 left. But then, with 57 seconds left, the Women of Troy tied the game up once more and forced a second overtime period.
Stanford scored on its first possession of the second overtime, and though the Women of Troy had possession in the last few seconds of the game, their final shot missed and the Cardinal emerged victorious.
“I’m disappointed that we did not win the game,” Vavic said. “There were lots of things that we did well, especially in the first quarter, but then we changed … We had an opportunity to win the game at the end and we missed it.”
The Women of Troy were happy with their defensive play, despite the loss.
“One thing that we have been working on is our 5 on 6 defense and we only let them score 2 out of 11 and that was a great positive that came out,” Bekhazi said. “[In the future] I think our fast break defense will not have any more mental breakdowns and we will not allow any more natural goals.”
Regardless of the outcome, Vavic said he was pleased with the team’s attitude.
“Overall I was very pleased with the energy,” he said. “Even when we did not play well, we were still playing with energy.”

Stanford vowed to focus its defensive attention on containing USC senior opposite Murphy Troy on Friday night. To its credit, the No. 3 Cardinal (16-7, 12-6) was wildly successful in executing that game plan, as Troy managed a mere eight kills at a dismal .059 clip.
Cardinal killer · Once again, junior outside hitter Tony Ciarelli gave Stanford problems all night, posting 21 kills in addition to four aces. - Carlo Acenas | Daily Trojan 
Troy’s rare off-night was only a minor footnote, however, as the Trojans recorded a 25-22, 21-25, 25-22, 25-22 victory over visiting Stanford in a testament to USC’s depth. With several players capable of shouldering scoring duties, Troy’s poor performance simply became an opportunity for others to lead.
Junior outside hitter Tony Ciarelli, who has frustrated the Cardinal in multiple outings, followed up his 12-kill, five-ace performance against Stanford last month with an even more impressive encore performance of 21 kills and four aces.
“I don’t think there’s one star [on our team],” said USC coach Bill Ferguson. “Murphy gets the most press, but everybody in our lineup’s good. Teams are going to try to stop one player, and every big match we’ve had, teams may have shut down one of our players, but there are always two who step up.”
Another one of those players who stepped up Friday was sophomore outside hitter Madison McKibbin, who began the season as a starter, but was supplanted early on by senior outside hitter Tri Bourne. Ferguson inserted McKibbin into the lineup at the end of the second set.
“He brought the score much closer,” Ferguson said. “He turned the momentum around, leading us into the third set. In the fourth set, he came in as a blocking substitute for [senior setter] Riley [McKibbin], and not only did he get a big stuff block that put us ahead, but he also had real key sets.”
The victory was satisfying for the Trojans as it came against a program that recruits from the same areas, has also advanced to the NCAA championship game within the last five years and whose coach, John Kosty, was hired the same year as Ferguson. Moreover, with the victory, the Trojans assured themselves the opportunity to clinch the Mountain Pacific Sports Federation title outright the next night against conference doormat No. 16 Pacific (10-17, 4-15).
As expected, the Trojans breezed to a 25-18, 25-15, 25-17 sweep of struggling Pacific, which has dropped eight of its last 12 games. As a result, USC secured the No. 1 seed in the MPSF playoffs and home-field advantage throughout the tournament.
During the match, the Trojans received contributions from Troy and Bourne, as both registered double-digit kills.
What was most impressive, however, was the team’s professionalism.
“I told the team that I was almost more proud of the way they played against Pacific than the way they played against Stanford,” Ferguson said. “The night before, it was a big, emotional match, and we were able to turn around and avoid a letdown. The team has been very mature and competitive all season, and it was impressive the way they were able to take care of business.”
USC returns to action Friday in Honolulu to take on Hawaii at 8 p.m.

Last June, after a four-year NCAA investigation, then-USC Athletic Director Mike Garrett echoed a commonly held sentiment: The NCAA had it in for USC.
At a hotel ballroom in San Francisco, filled with 180 university boosters, Garrett responded to the Committee on Infractions’ 67-page report by accusing college athletics’ governing body of jealousy.
“As I read the decision by the NCAA,” he said. “I read between the lines and there was nothing but a lot of envy. They wish they all were Trojans.”
Garrett, unsurprisingly, was less than contrite. He was frustrated and bitter, perplexed that USC could be so severely punished even with all the program’s accolades.
Garrett’s comments, no doubt, exuded arrogance — representative of an old culture at USC, where accountability was at times lacking, particularly in regards to meeting the NCAA’s standards.
Yet, that all seemed to change when Pat Haden replaced Garrett in August. In just eight months on the job, the Rhodes Scholar has been quick to acknowledge the problems the old administration created.
“We’re trying to build a better relationship with the NCAA,” Haden told CBS Sports’ Dennis Dodd last week. “We have not been very good at that at USC. It’s our fault.”
Things have changed under Haden — that’s been more than clear — and it starts and stops with compliance.
Haden’s USC has been vastly different from Garrett’s USC in that it has become a paradigm for self-reporting. It’s everything the NCAA envisions college athletic departments to be: vigilant in monitoring its players and coaches.
When tailback Dillon Baxter accepted a golf cart ride from a student agent in November, an act deemed to be an extra benefit, he was immediately suspended and forced to pay $5 to a local charity by USC’s newly beefed-up compliance office.
When basketball coach Kevin O’Neill was involved in a verbal altercation with an Arizona booster, he was swiftly suspended for the remainder of the Pac-10 tournament.
And when Reggie Bush was retroactively deemed ineligible by the NCAA in June, Haden returned Bush’s Heisman Trophy before receiving an official ruling from the Heisman Trust.
Some have called it appeasement; Haden calls it winning the right way. Whatever the preferred terminology is, this is USC in 2011.
“We want to win the correct way, which we will,” Haden said when he took over as athletic director. “We’re going to play within the rules.”
But the new mantra begs the question: Can USC still win? Can a program that has won 11 national championships on the gridiron still compete with various Big Ten and SEC powerhouses that, at least according to a recent HBO report, continue to act as if they are above NCAA bylaws?
As detailed by HBO’s Real Sports with Bryant Gumbel on Wednesday, four former Auburn players, Stanley McClover, Troy Reddick, Chaz Ramsey and Raven Gray, received thousands of dollars in cash while being recruited by, or playing for, the Tigers. It came in book bags, 4-inch by 9-inch envelopes and handshakes with boosters. And it came often.
On other recruiting trips to LSU, Michigan State and Ohio State, they received similar payments from respective boosters and others with ties to the programs. Again, the payments came often.
Such methods allowed schools to guarantee the biggest and best players signed letters of intent to come play football for them.
But if that’s the culture of college football in 2011, where cash payments equate to success, can USC still be afforded the opportunity to win “the right way?”
Are winning on Saturdays, boasting quality academic programs and remaining in good standing with the NCAA mutually exclusive? It seems that way sometimes.
Stanford, Duke, Northwestern, Vanderbilt and Notre Dame, which are all ranked in the top 20 of the US News & World Report’s National Universities category, have averaged just five wins per season over the past five years. They have compiled a combined mark of 131-178, winning just two bowl games en route to cementing their places as middle-tier college football programs. This raises the question as to whether USC is headed down a similar path under Haden, as the university’s academic standing continues to rise.
No doubt, pay-for-play provides a recruiting advantage to certain programs, raising at least some doubt as to whether schools can juggle all the balls. It’s unquestionably a disappointing trend, and a sad mark on the sport, but it has nonetheless become more than fair to ask if, under Haden, USC will be granted the luxury of winning without cheating.
“The 19th Hole” runs Mondays. To comment on this article email Joey at jrkaufma@usc.edu or visit dailytrojan.com.
Nice article Joey.  Of course, USC has never been a pay for play school.  However, the tradition of the football program and location of the college has allowed USC to recruit honestly.  Haden didn’t have much choice given the NCAA probation, however it appears that there could be an over compliance issue.  It is necessary to follow the rules, but common sense needs to be applied and situations need to be handled in a reasonable manner similar to what other schools would do.  There is no question that the NCAA mishandled the USC case and gave excessive sanctions compared to other colleges with lesser offenses.  Some of the sanctions like not allowing fans to attend practices for four years are just plain stupid, and Paul Dee’s explanation for the scholarship losses shows how arbitrary his committee rendered their decisions.  I also don’t understand Haden’s comments that USC would not take legal action if the appeal is denied.  While this may be the case for reasons that many fans don’t agree, the NCAA didn’t need to know this.

It doesn’t appear a sophomore slump is on the horizon for wide receiver Robert Woods.
The second-year wideout dominated practice Saturday, when USC held its first scrimmage of the spring.
Scoring threat · In addition to his wide receiver duties, Robert Woods returned a punt for a touchdown in USC’s first spring scrimmage. - Tim Tran | Daily Trojan 
He broke out of a dogpile of tacklers and ran 70 yards for a touchdown in Saturday’s scrimmage, after returning a punt for a touchdown in a special teams drill. The first play of the scrimmage was a quick out to Woods, and he was quarterback Matt Barkley’s first look on nearly every play.
“You can feel the difference when you have a dominant receiver,” said USC coach Lane Kiffin. “We have that when [Woods] is out here. And you can really feel the difference when he’s not.”
The offense won the scrimmage on the very last play, converting a fourth and five from the 10-yard line for a touchdown. Sophomore wide receiver Markeith Ambles caught Barkley’s pass at the three, spun around and dove into the endzone as the offensive sideline stormed the field.
Apart from that play and Woods’ run, however, much of the scrimmage was controlled by the defense.
Freshman linebacker Hayes Pullard intercepted a Barkley pass and was on his way to returning it “to the promised land,” according to the redshirt freshman. “But then I got tired and fumbled.”
The scrimmage proved to be very intense. 6-foot, 185 pound redshirt freshman cornerback Anthony Brown laid out redshirt freshman tight end Randall Telfer, who is listed at 6-foot-4, 230 pounds.
Later, on a fourth and one, redshirt freshman tailback D.J. Morgan got two yards and a first down on a swing route before he literally got his helmet knocked off. Naturally, the defensive sideline erupted, but Morgan got up and quickly pointed out he had in fact gotten the first down before an official intervened and sent him back towards his own side.
“It was a live practice,” Kiffin said. “We had the live team scrimmage at the end and some live drills early in practice. It’s good to get a lot of tackling in; a lot of realistic, game situations to watch our guys perform in.”
Morgan appear pleased as well.
“We’re just getting in to full contact drills, so everybody wants to show they can hit,” he said. “They come in trying to tee off. So I’m trying to deliver the blow to them and hit them harder than they hit me.”

Senior defensive end Armond Armstead returned to practice after being hospitalized for an undisclosed medical condition in early March. Armstead met with university doctors Friday and got the OK to participate in non-football activities.
He will be reduced to weightlifting and conditioning for the rest of the spring as he awaits the results of tests taken following his release from the hospital.
Nonetheless, the 6-foot-5, 295-pounder who started 11 games for the Trojans last year is happy with the step in the right direction.
“I feel really good being able to be out here and work out and run,” Armstead said.
Armstead again refused to reveal the reason for his initial hospitalization, saying only that he had been feeling sick.

Among the spring storylines rest a few interesting position battles on the horizon. Redshirt freshman quarterback Jesse Scroggins took most of the reps with the second team and seems to be the favorite to back up junior quarterback Matt Barkley.
Freshman Cody Kessler was the only other quarterback to get reps in any full-team drills.
At placekicker, freshmen Craig McMahon and Andre Heidari went toe-to-toe with field goals in the scrimmage.
Both were nearly perfect. McMahon had a pair of misses from 35-yards, and Heidari had his only miss from the same distance.
FIGHT ON APPEAL!!!

A trip to the Women’s National Invitation Tournament might not have been what the USC women’s basketball team wanted when the season began nearly six months ago.
Not enough · Junior guard Briana Gilbreath, pictured here against UCLA, along with junior guard Ashley Corral and freshman forward Cassie Harberts, finished with 14 points each, but USC was still outdone by host Toledo. - Kelvin Kuo | Daily Trojan 
But Saturday afternoon, the Women of Troy (24-13) found themselves playing for their first postseason title since the 1983-84 season.
The only team standing in their way was the Toledo Rockets.
In a closely contested battle, Toledo finally pulled away midway through the second half, boosted by a raucous home crowd and the play of guard Naama Shafir, as USC fell short of the title, 76-68.
“It was a great experience and we had a good run,” said senior center Kari LaPlante. “Unfortunately, we couldn’t finish it.”
Shafir scored a career-high 40 points, including 28 in the second half, to lead Toledo to its first postseason title in program history.
“She was hitting on all cylinders,” said junior guard Briana Gilbreath. “[Shafir] was just on … and she’s a very good player.”
USC led by as many as seven points in the early going in large part because of Gilbreath’s hot shooting from the field.
Gilbreath had 10 points during a three-and-a-half minute stretch early in the first half, including back-to-back three-pointers that gave the Women of Troy their largest lead at 16-9.
The Rockets, however, would come roaring back, going on a 9-0 run of their own to take the lead, at 18-16.
The lead changed six times in the first half, and Toledo eventually closed the first half on an 8-2 run to take a 35-32 lead into halftime.
Shafir had 12 points at halftime to lead the Rockets, but she was just getting started.
“When [Shafir] penetrated, it was hard to get out on their shooters,” LaPlante said. “We had to pick and choose what to do. We’d rather have her get twos than threes, and we picked our poison.”
Coming out of halftime, USC slowly inched back into the lead, going up 44-42 on a three-pointer by junior guard Ashley Corral with less than 13 minutes to play.
Shafir would go on to score Toledo’s next 12 points, however, to put the Rockets up 54-47 and ahead for good.
“Each team was going to make its run and we just had some difficulty making a run of our own,” LaPlante said. “It eventually came, but it came a little too late.”
USC faced its largest deficit at 67-53 with a little more than three minutes to play, but battled back to cut it to four points at 72-68 with about 20 seconds remaining.
“There were parts in the game where we didn’t play our game, and it hurt us,” Gilbreath said. “We made some mental lapses on offense and defense, and [Toledo] capitalized on them.”
But Shafir converted four free throws at the end to give her 40 for the game.
Gilbreath, senior guard Jacki Gemelos and freshman forward Cassie Harberts tallied 14 points apiece to lead five USC players in double figures.
LaPlante finished with 10 points and eight rebounds, while Corral chipped in with 12 points off the bench.
Gilbreath and Corral were named to the WNIT All-Tournament Team for their strong performances in the tournament.
Aside from Shafir, forward Melissa Goodall was the only Toledo player to reach double figures with 12 points.
Despite the loss, LaPlante believes the team improved as a cohesive unit during this tournament run.
“We’ve grown a lot,” LaPlante said. “This tournament was really fun, we were a completely different team, and were playing a lot better and together.”
And with LaPlante and senior forward Michelle Franco as the only players graduating, the team has high hopes for next season.
“I’m proud of us getting this far, proud of the hard work we put in and I’m proud of the team whether we lost or not,” Gilbreath said. “But if we play like we did at the end of this season at the beginning of next season, we’ll be unstoppable.”

The Charlie Sheen craze has officially begun to wear off.
There was a period during the catastrophic events of Japan that one didn’t often hear about the daily doings and sayings of Charlie Sheen but recently another turn of events has caused him to return to the spotlight. His opening night of “My Violent Torpedo of Truth: Defeat is Not an Option” tour has proven that he is no longer “winning” and his only option is defeat.
Although it may seem insane that sane people would pay to listen to Sheen’s mind blowingly idiotic rants, an audience of reportedly around 5,000 people sat down to listen to him Saturday, April 2 in Detroit. According to The Hollywood Reporter, and practically every other media news outlet, the beginning of his 20-city tour completely and utterly bombed.
The show was deemed, “egomania gone wrong” with “the overwritten, faux-Biblical preaching of self-anointed Messiah, who views himself as the most truthful person in the universe.”
Instead of the promised night of “pure magic, a night of winning” the audience got mostly a presentation through videos, such as Sheen’s 20/20 interview, a video of Snoop Dogg and fellow rapper Simon Rex performing, and a tribute to Sheen’s father Martin Sheen. 
Sheen has proven himself to be not a stand-up comedian but someone who is obsessed with his arrogant and erratic ways and believes everyone else should be too.
Eventually Sheen was booed off the stage by a chant of “Refund! Refund!” after he had both insulted their city as a place of crack cocaine addicts and only answering questions from the audience if he thought them interesting enough.
Is this the end of the craze of Sheen-ism? Let’s hope.

For the first time in three decades, the total number of female legislators is dropping — the solution, some say, is to increase the number of women involved in student government.
Working · Logan Lachman, vice-president elect, and Sam Freitag, 2010-2011 USG residential senator, are some of the females involved in USG. A recent study found less than a third of student presidents nationwide are women. - Robin Laird | Daily Trojan 
But although men have traditionally dominated the student government ranks, USC’s Undergraduate Student Government, maintains a strong female presence.
“Our staff is just about a 50-50 split between males and females,” said Maya Babla, former USG chief of staff.
Among the top 50 colleges ranked by U.S. News & World Report, less than one-third of the student body presidents are women, according to a finding released by the American Student Government Association.
Although the overall balance of men and women in USG is fairly equal, since spring 2006 none of the 18 candidates for USG president and only one-third of the candidates for USG vice president have been female. The last female candidate to run for president was Jessica Lall, who was elected in 2005.
Logan Lachman, who won the vice president spot this year and will be sworn into office Tuesday, said she believes there are stereotypes about females in elected offices.
“Unfortunately, I do believe there are stereotypes associated with women in power. There is always a common misconception that women are weaker than men and therefore don’t make strong leaders,” Lachman said. “These stereotypes can affect voters as well as potential future candidates.”
American University’s Women & Politics Institute found that in 2006, 72 percent of students involved in the university’s student government were male.
Ava Lubell, the political director of the institute, told the Daily Trojan last year that women of all ages are less likely to see themselves as good candidates.
“Women need to be asked to run,” Lubell told the Daily Trojan. “They’re less likely to perceive themselves as being recruited, so you need to say explicitly, ‘We think you should run.’”
In Congress, women make up only 17 percent of members. Women make up 28 percent of the California Legislature and 23 percent of state legislators nationwide. Six of the nation’s governors, or 12 percent, are women, according to the National Foundation of Women Legislators.
“Quite honestly, I don’t think you’d be able to find these gender differences [at USC], and perhaps that’s an indication of the gender barrier being broken down a little further for our generation,” Babla said.
Though times have changed since women fought for the right to vote, traditional roles might continue to influence the role of gender in politics.
“I think a lot of things, other than their stance on issues, play a part in how a female candidate is perceived,” Babla said. “Voters still stereotype women candidates in some ways, and seek to better understand these ladies in terms of their family roles.”
Lachman said she has not found women to be shy about getting involved in student government at USC.
”We’ve never really had a problem getting female participation,” she said.
This is ludicrous, out of the past 50 Student body presidents USC has had, only 7 have been women.
That’s right, only 7. Don’t believe me? Email USG and ask them for the stats.
Pathetic
“Told the Daily Trojan” — twice? Does that mean all the other interviews in this article were for ATVN?
Women are holding there own! It’s nice to here…! Great article.
excellent article! Well written and very interesting!!!!
Actually, the information you’ve quoted is not accurate. ASGA’s research on every student government in America shows that nearly 52 percent of “student government” officers and members nationwide are women. About 40 percent of student government presidents are women. This is according to the American Student Government Association’s annual research on student governments through the United States.
While the American Student Government Association is a reliable organization that supports collegiate student governments nationwide their data takes into consideration community colleges, technical and trade city colleges, as well as graduate and professional schools. The statistic Butch Oxendine refers to was released by the U.S. News and World Report and is based off the top 50 colleges in America, not every college in America. Since USC is among the top 50, I found it more appropriate to compare USG with student government’s belonging to Universities of a similar stature and composition.

The Black Student Assembly has announced plans to scale back its annual music and fashion show, Gearfest, because of a shift in programming interests.
Last year, Gearfest featured Bruno Mars and cost approximately $30,000, according to BSA President Eric Burse. BSA had only budgeted $15,000 for the event and had to rely on USG spring allocations and Program Board cosponsors to make up the difference.
Music · Bruno Mars performed at USC’s Gearfest 2010, Sex in Public, Eva Marcille Pigford of America’s Next Top Model hosted the event. -  Daily Trojan file photo 
Burse said Gearfest has been one of the organization’s larger events in previous years, but BSA has been working to increase year-long programming, instead of focusing on single events.
“We’ve been getting more people involved, expanding our leadership and creating new committees to get people involved,” Burse said. “There are more opportunities, more people coming out and more people becoming active.”
This year Burse said BSA will host Gearfest, which will be held April 15, within the budget USG offered so BSA could provide more funding for other events. Burse said the details for the event have not been finalized.
BSA requested $25,000 for Gearfest this spring, but only received $13,952.15 from the USG spring allocations budget.
BSA applied for an additional $2,000 dollars from USG, but did not receive the funds, by a vote of eight to four.
“BSA has previously asked us for large sums for this particular event and an additional $2,000 might not be able to achieve that level of making this event significantly better,” said Howard Fu, a commuter senator who voted against the funds.
Burse said BSA has already initiated a large alumni mailing, hoping to bring in donations, and raised between $3,000 and $4,000 in additional funding for the event.
“It’s the last big event of the year,” Burse said. “We’d like to make it as good as we can.”
The money BSA saved by not going all-out for Gearfest this year has been used to sponsor monthly performances at Ground Zero, increase BSA’s  programming during Parents’ Weekend and host a monthly Distinguished Speaker Series featuring both celebrities and professors.
Ryan Cole, a black freshman majoring in political science, said these events have made him more comfortable at USC.
“It makes me feel more welcomed, like people have an interest in you,” Cole said. “I feel more comfortable at USC and it’s really helped my transition into college. The events also aren’t limited to black students, and help people of other races experience what black culture is and what it means.”
BSA has also been doing more off-campus activities such as monthly meetings with other black student groups from Los Angeles universities, including Loyola Marymount University and UCLA, where they coordinate programming and discuss solutions to problems such as low retention rates of black students at universities and racism on campuses.
Kenyatta McLean, president of the UCLA Afrikan Student Union, said she’s glad USC enabled multiple collegiate groups to address larger issues for black students in higher education because the UCLA Afrikan Student Union does not have the budget to host the events on its own.
“I really commend USC for bringing [these meetings] together, because sometimes we can get caught up in the rivalry of our different campuses,” McLean said. “For us, it’s not really something we could have afforded to do. Because there are such low access numbers for black people coming to college, we really need to support each other.”

Several recent events have shone a spotlight on the Internet’s ability to enable sexism, racism and general negativity. The UCLA “Asians in the Library” video, the Kappa Sigma email, the campaign to make CollegeACB anonymous — chances are, this list is familiar.
Many young adults know how to slap content on a webpage. Our ability to foresee the consequences of what we post, however, hasn’t quite caught up with our ability to use the Internet.
Part of the problem is the Internet promotes intolerance.
At USC, being bluntly racist isn’t socially acceptable. Still, with a little eavesdropping, one can hear plenty of borderline racist comments. They’re usually just racist enough to be offensive, but just mild enough to allow speakers to call them “jokes.”
It’s easy to avoid admitting that our campus has a problem. Where’s the proof?
Nowadays, it’s online. It takes one look at CollegeACB to figure out not all Trojans embrace diversity. Uploading is so easy it can be impulsive, especially if no one knows who you are.
But words on a forum, however trivial, are more permanent than words mumbled in a hallway. More importantly, they’re harder to ignore.
Although the aptly titled “It’s time to take the ‘anonymous’ out of CollegeACB” campaign has good intentions, it doesn’t solve any problems. The problem isn’t that we can’t attach names to the sexists and racists. The problem is the fact they exist in the first place.
Since people clearly think offensive thoughts, it’s better to know exactly what those thoughts are. The challenge is figuring out what to do with it. Unless the United States wants to follow Iran’s lead and start censoring the internet, no one can stop hateful comments from spreading like wildfire.
The best option is to take advantage of the very quality that makes the Internet so effective for haters: its egalitarian nature.
In the past, society’s privileged groups had wildly disproportionate control over which messages got sent and which did not.
Now, with the Internet, traditionally disadvantaged groups have the  opportunity to point out intolerance whenever they want. The key is to make the protests as loud as the hate — and with style.
No one likes to be preached at, but most people can appreciate a fiery debate, and everyone loves a good joke. That’s why articles mocking the Kappa Sigma email are easier to find than the email itself; that’s why videos satirizing the UCLA “Asians in the Library” rant keep getting so many hits.
Thus, the Internet is a fantastic place to let the world know that yes, you’re aware of racism in your community, and no, you’re not going to let it go unnoticed.
The amount of hate on the Internet is scary, but censorship of any kind is not the answer.
Beyond First Amendment implications, censorship allows problems like latent bigotry to be covered up and ignored. The process of unveiling it might be uncomfortable, but no group in the United States is condemned to just sitting and listening. Find a computer and respond.
 
Maya Itah is a junior majoring in communication.
The author seems to imply only disadvantaged people can ne victims of intolerance – I have met plenty of students that come from poor families who are very racist *gasp*! let’s not play into the cliche only rich WASPs can be the intolerant ones who have the power to squash their intolerance from the public psyche. How many times have we seen the evil, rich white intolerant middle aged man versus the poor but honest person of color?

Now that Trojan Grounds has returned to its usual 24-hour operations, it seems USC Hospitality’s attempts to make amends have temporarily mollified the student body.

Of course, some students will still complain about the limited options in Everybody’s Kitchen, blanch at the prohibitive prices at the Ronald Tutor Campus Center.
But overall, USC Hospitality has proven quite responsive to student input.
Not only will TroGro remain open 24/7 at least until this summer, but after Always Living In View of the Environment, an environmental student group, circulated a petition that solicited more than 4,300 student signatures, USC Hospitality will now serve eggs from cage-free farms beginning this fall. Additionally, the Tutor Center might soon offer an online food ordering system to alleviate the long lines around lunch time.
USC Hospitality can continue to improve by acting on student input.
Students flooded Hospitality with emails to protest the reduced hours at TroGro, and Hospitality responded favorably within a week.
Kris Klinger, director of USC Hospitality, promised to hold discussions with students and administrators to determine whether or not TroGro will continue its 24/7 operations next year.
Besides bringing California Pizza Kitchen and Lemonade to campus after gathering student input on what restaurants to include in the Tutor Center. Hospitality also noticeably improved the residence hall dining experience. EVK added a much-appreciated Panini machine and Parkside now sports a space-age-looking coffee maker.
Although as a freshman I’ve never gone hungry on a Friday because I had used up all my dining swipes, I still appreciate the convenience of unlimited swipes into either EVK or Parkside as part of the new meal plans, again courtesy of USC Hospitality and based on student input.
Still, there are a few relatively simple changes, as well as some more ambitious goals, that can further improve the student dining experience.
USC is a health-conscious campus. On-campus restaurants at the Tutor Center and Café 84 could be encouraged to display nutritional labeling, as is already done in the dining halls.
Currently, EVK and Parkside display labels above some of the food choices, containing caloric count and other nutritional information. Not everything is labeled, however. At EVK, for example, the bread table, the salad bar and some other dishes only have a label with a name and no further nutritional description.
Hospitality could provide nutritional information for menu items next to food, or post nutritional information online at Hospitality’s website for easy access.
Hospitality has already shown a willingness to embrace environmentally friendly measures such as purchasing eggs from cage-free farms. Despite the financial burden of local, organically grown produce and humanely raised livestock, there are numerous health benefits to making the switch, and Hospitality could continue its efforts to buy environmentally friendly food.
Hospitality has shown this past year it is dedicated to improving students’ dining experience at USC and to taking student input seriously. As students, it is our responsibility to make our voices heard so Hospitality can continue its improvements.

My dining experience would be improved with more organic food, and less effort being put into getting panini machines at EVK, when Popovich makes paninis and is about 5 minutes away. I appreciate the cage-free eggs, but to cause so much commotion about TroGro or the prices at Tudor (are we surprised it’s expensive?) seems like a waste of effort that could go towards *fair trade coffee in the dining halls, organic or fairly-cultivated ingredients, and things that actually have impact to the community. I mean, if you can’t find cheap food on campus, take a walk down Fig, there are a lot of food places.

Going to a horror flick these days is not dissimilar to attending mass; There are certain age-old customs to be endured. A gleeful moan as the lights dim, the brittle tapping of anxious toes on the floor, the first true scream as a shape darts across the screen.
Wide eyed · Insidious falls flat despite the acting talent of Rose Byrne and Patrick Wilson. Parts of the film are even unintentionally humorous. - Photo courtesy of Heather Salazar 
Watching Insidious, the new film from James Wan, I expected these rituals. What instead caught me off-guard was a sage observation from one viewer behind me, during a theoretically scary moment: “Is that an elf?”
It takes a kind of genius to engineer a genuinely awful film, and Wan and his writer, Leigh Whannell, both of whom brought us the first Saw installment, have outdone themselves here.
Whereas more recent studio sludge in this genre has at least replicated elements of Halloween or The Exorcist with stale success, Insidious hits nearly every wrong note, as though deliberately.
Renai (Rose Byrne), Josh (Patrick Wilson) and their three kids have just moved to a new house, after experiencing vague “problems” in the last one. Their oldest son, Dalton (Ty Simpkins) is exploring the attic one day and then, inexplicably, winds up in a coma shortly after.
Months go by, and strange things slowly begin to happen. Doors open on their own, disturbing sounds crackle through the baby monitor and, one night, a ghost that looks terrifyingly like Thomas Ian Griffith in The Karate Kid 3 hurtles through a bedroom window.
Enter a matronly mystic (Lin Shaye) and a team of paranormal activity technicians (Angus Sampson and Leigh Whannell), both looking as though they failed their auditions for the Broadway musical The Book of Mormon.
As the film’s ad campaign has  already suggested, the house is not what’s haunted.
It seems Dalton, through his dreams, has become trapped in a netherworld of lost, malevolent spirits called “The Further,” without any means of finding his way home. Don’t you hate when that happens?
That Insidious fails in almost every respect is at first surprising, given the grisly talent evidenced in Wan and Whannell’s earlier collaboration.
But where Saw was an operatic bloodbath of wits and broken bones, spiritually sinister material like Insidious calls for a more delicate, tempered hand.
In Insidious, the most obvious tools in a cineaste’s handbook are employed to baffling effect. Cameras glide to and from in front of the family’s house. Loud gongs shake the viewers’ eardrums during brief appearances by ghosts and demons, most of which elicit more belly laughs than blubbering whimpers.
When a character describes a bad dream, we can be sure Wan will proceed to show us that dream, as though our own nightmarish projections were less worthy of inducing shivers and sweaty palms.
The worst offense is the lack of coalescence between the horror and the humdrum. Many times, Insidious feels like two different movies macromated together.
The more benign, domestic scenes are free of any atmosphere or unease. Once the bad guys turn up, the percussion intensifies, the lighting darkens and even the food in the refrigerator seems to ooze evil.
How Byrne and Wilson, both credible actors, wound up here is more unnerving than anything Wan can conjure.
Wilson, in particular, frets and frowns his way through the film, as though remembering the days when he was billed with Kate Winslet in Little Children. Even Barbara Hershey, who makes a late appearance as Josh’s mother, is not enough to lend an air of sophistication to the project.
The best that can be said about Insidious is it might cause viewers to consider watching The Shining again. If you want a successful example of the craft and convergence missing from Insidious, look no further than Stanley Kubrick’s phantasmal blood-chiller.
Throughout Wan’s picture, I couldn’t help but recall the labyrinthine halls of the Overlook Hotel and the sound of Danny Lloyd’s plastic tricycle wheels filling the empty hallways without the presence of digital effects, theatrical lighting or a Hollywood score to wipe away the dread.
 
 
 
you may be the dumbest person on earth.  i honestly hate you after reading this article.  everything you say is dead wrong and completely stupid, you moron.  this is why no one reads your website, because you honestly dont know how to review a simple movie.
hah oops wrong website sorry
Bob, try to contain the inner rage and lighten up. Surely, there is some sense of humor lurking in a dark corner of your house….the review is outstanding and funny as well….and even makes a recommendation if this kind of movie is your genre of choice….The Shining…a great movie

Director Joe Wright charts new territory in his latest film, Hanna.
Here, the director spins the story of a deadly assassin girl, Hanna (Saoirse Ronan) and her expatriate father (Eric Bana), living together in the wilderness.  The young heroine, only 16, ventures into the real world to seek refuge and a “normal” life.  
Needless to say, it is a far cry from Wright’s past projects, which include Pride and Prejudice and Atonement.
From the beginning, viewers are presented with a violent, voyeuristic look at an everyday hunting scene in the day and life of Hanna and her father.  The scene opens up the narrative, but also establishes a Kill Bill-esque vibe that persists throughout.
It is hard to avoid the expectation Hanna will mimic other action movies with predictable narratives, like the Mission Impossibles and the newer James Bonds. Furthermore, the idea of a super human, created to be an ultimate warrior is hardly fresh for the silver screen.
But where Wright is most successful is in his ability to shock the audience. In many scenes, Wright either does exactly the opposite of what is expected, or generously gives Hanna a deus ex machina, like random tourists in the Moroccan Desert, that dramatically flips the direction of the story.
The unexpected tourists Hanna finds in the desert are a family that appears to be a travelling pack of-Jack Kerouac-wannabes.
The family is a ridiculous group that initially feels like it should not be in the film. But Wright surpasses expectation and is able to use the family for comic relief.
Wright avoids the clichéd humor that is an epidemic with action movies and uses the vacationing family to give the audience something to genuinely laugh at. The daughter in particular offers a hilariously satirical look at materialistic youth.
Aside from random spurts of comedy, Wright also presents hefty symbolism and recurring images, creating a surging effect that drives the film forward from its jump-start beginning to its grating ending.
Nature and folklore seem to be the biggest motifs as a majority of the film is a journey through the external world. The very idea of experiencing the outside world is often coupled with references to the famous Grimm Brothers’ dark fairytales such as Little Red Riding Hood and Hansel & Gretel.
The only real shortcomings of the film are in Wright’s over-embellishment of cheesy action scenes and the lack of background information.
Some of the combat scenes, especially the hand-to-hand ones, are slowed down for dramatic effect. This effect fits appropriately in some scenes, but in others, the slow motion is bound to elicit more laughter than awe.
The cinematography, however, redeems the action scenes with fantastic effects when experimenting with different points of view, twisting camera angles and rotating shots.
Yet many of the characters, like Hanna’s grandmother and the main antagonist, Marissa (Cate Blanchett), are not given much back-story. This lack of background pervades the film, making some aspects of Hanna distracting and hard to follow.
But the acting in Hanna is top-notch, as Ronan portrays a protagonist who is simultaneously mysterious and creepy, yet somehow charismatic and badass. Blanchett successfully plays the role of the intense, malevolent and ruthless antagonist.
In addition to the premium acting, the music score composed by Ed Simons and Tom Rowlands, aka The Chemical Brothers is a stunning and fresh accomplishment.
The Chems’ electronic, bass-thumping music serves as a successful lynchpin for the film, as it magnifies the intensity of the action scenes, ultimately adding to Hanna’s abrasive edge.
Luckily for Wright (and the audience), the accomplishments of the film heavily outweigh the mishaps.
The film itself is an audacious action thriller that sometimes feels like it’s not only hell-bent on the destruction of Hanna, but on the viewer as well.
The ending is eerily similar to the beginning, leaving the viewer feeling shot in the face, but it is a morbid feeling viewers are sure to oddly enjoy.

The Trojans’ lucky number was seven this weekend at Marks Stadium as they walked away with two consecutive 7-0 wins against Oregon and Washington.
No. 2 USC (18-4, 4-0) exerted its dominance against the No. 65 Ducks and No. 20 Huskies, remaining undefeated in Pac-10 play this season. It was a consistent effort from top to bottom.
Continuing with the new doubles lineup, senior Jaak Poldma and sophomore J.T. Sundling paired together at No. 1 while freshman Emilio Gomez and junior Steve Johnson and freshman Ray Sarmiento and junior Daniel Nguyen played at the No. 2 and No. 3 spots.
“It’s been really cohesive with Jaak [Poldma] and J.T. [Sundling] at one,” Nguyen said. “Stevie [Johnson] is an unbelievable doubles player, and with Ray [Sarmiento] and me, we just sort of stepped up and dominated.”
Poldma and Sundling defeated Oregon’s Robin Cambier and Alex Rovello, and Washington’s Kyle McMorrow and Jeevan Nedunchezhiyan, 8-6.  Johnson and Gomez took 8-2 and 8-7 wins against the Ducks and Huskies, respectively. Nguyen and Sarmiento grabbed 8-1 and 8-3 wins, and Nguyen was not shy in praising his doubles counterpart.
“I think we work well together and complement each other,” Nguyen said.
Neither the Ducks nor the Huskies caused any serious panic for the Trojans, who came out as the dominant team both days. Though glimpses of frustration could be seen at times, each player bounced back to pocket the wins.
“It was a little rough in the beginning,” Nguyen said of his match against the Ducks’ Cambier. “He was really feisty and in my face. It felt good to pull out a tough win.”
Johnson and Poldma won both of their singles matches to stay undefeated on the season.
Sarmiento, Gomez and freshman Michael Grant filled out the singles roster at the No. 4, No. 5 and No. 6 spots. On both days, Sarmiento and Gomez won in straight sets, while Grant took it to three sets and a tie-breaker against Oregon and Washington, respectively, to eventually snag two victories.
As has been the case this season, singles play was much easier for the Trojans, who only have three regular season matches before the Pac-10 tournament. As the post-season approaches, USC knows that there is still work to be done, and it is willing to do it.
“We need to keep working on doubles,” Nguyen said. “We’ve proven that our singles is strong, so what will differentiate us from the others is gaining confidence in doubles.”

We all know the meaning of momentum, but what about “womentum?”
Described as “an inspirational force gained over a distance of five kilometers applied to the eradication of cancers in women,” the clever pun is the Entertainment Industry Foundation’s trademark marketing tool in promoting its annual Revlon Run/Walk for Women, scheduled for Saturday, May 7.
The 5K course begins at the California Science Center on Figueroa Street, twists around Hoover Street and Vermont Avenue and ends at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum.
Participants are split into runners and walkers.
The runners start the race at 8:45 a.m., and the walkers start at 9 a.m.
The Revlon Run/Walk is one of Los Angeles’ biggest 5K races every year. Last year’s event drew a crowd of about 29,000 participants.
Not surprisingly, more than 22,000 of those were female.
The aim of the race, as the name suggests, is to eradicate women’s diseases by supporting cancer research.
Many of the participants are cancer survivors who are encouraged to wear special “Survivor Caps,” designed specifically for those who have won their battles against cancer.
But you don’t need to have any personal affiliation with women’s cancers to participate.
Although the race strongly encourages survivors to be involved and to share their stories, anybody can register and participate.
The most important aspect of the event is to spread awareness and to raise money.
The race costs $35 to register as an individual, or you can register with a team.
By registering, you not only get to participate in the race, but also will automatically receive a free T-shirt and goodie bag on race day.
Not sure you have the money just yet, or don’t want to commit to anything too soon? On-site registration is possible for $40.
The race, like most 5Ks, places  a heavy emphasis on charity and fundraising.
You don’t have to raise extra money other than what you pay to register, but it’s highly encouraged.
All of the proceeds go to cancer research and support the financial needs of female cancer patients.
There are quite a few incentives for those willing to fundraise, too.
If you raise at least $250, you get a EIF Revlon Run/Walk canvas tote bag. For the high-achievers, raising more than $5,000 will get you a $500 Macy’s gift card.
One of the most exciting parts of the event is the opening ceremony.
Last year, the celebrity hosts included Modern Family’s Julie Bowen, CSI’s Marg Helgenberger, dancer Carrie Ann Inaba and Desperate Housewives’ James Denton.
The celebrities were enthusiastic, supportive and deeply passionate about the cause, allowing them to truly connect to the crowd on an emotional level.
This year, celebrity hosts include Academy Award-winner Halle Berry and How I Met Your Mother star Alyson Hannigan. American Idol finalist Kimberly Locke is also scheduled to sing the National Anthem.
With celebrities, goodie bags and an exciting racetrack, everybody should join in the fun, right?
Not exactly.
The problem with the event is it isn’t designed for those wishing to compete.
Besides the issue of overcrowding, there are no distinctions between age groups or official timing methods.
But the race isn’t supposed to be competitive.
Instead, it’s meant to bring people together to fight women’s cancers.
For non-runners, the run/walk is a great opportunity to support a charitable cause and bond with friends and family. Students can grab a friend or two and register as a team.
The event can also  provide a brief break from exams. The weekend of the Revlon Run/Walk comes between finals weeks.
By taking just a few hours to move your body, you’re bound to feel better about yourself and gain some energy you might have lost because of nonstop studying or sleeping in too late.
So don’t put it off: Go online and register for the race.
If you’re a runner, take the time to train and stay fit.
If you’re a walker, see it as an opportunity to socialize, grab some free food and be a part of an inspirational group of people who are capable of changing lives.

Bob Cantu’s days at USC might be coming to an end.
The assistant coach and top recruiter for the USC men’s basketball team appears to be a candidate for the head coaching positions at UC Davis and Fresno State.
A source close to the situation at UC Davis told the Los Angeles Daily News the school interviewed Cantu Saturday morning in Houston, where this year’s Final Four is being held. UC Davis officials have not confirmed this information.
Gary Stewart recently stepped down as head coach of UC Davis after eight seasons.
Fresno State announced Cantu is a candidate for its head coaching position, after announcing Thursday that coach Steve Cleveland had been fired after six seasons.
The news of Cantu’s potential departure does not come as a complete surprise. He recently said in an interview he had aspirations to be a head coach and didn’t know how much more time he would spend at USC.
“You want to have goals in this profession and that’s definitely my goal,” Cantu said. “When the right time comes and the right opportunity comes, I’d definitely like to look into it.”
Cantu coached the Trojans in this season’s Pac-10 semifinal game against Arizona, while USC coach Kevin O’Neill served a one-game suspension for an off-court altercation.
FoxSports.com named Cantu one of the top 20 college basketball assistant coaches in 2008. Nine players he has recruited have gone on to play in the NBA.
Before coming to USC, Cantu coached at Sacramento State and Cuesta College in San Luis Obispo.
