When the Undergraduate Student Government Senate passed a proposal for a dining hall take-out container program on Tuesday, it held a magnifying glass to the waste and insufficiency of the dining hall program at USC. Allowing students to take some food home with them recognizes the existence of a number of systemic issues, ranging from campus food insecurity to students’ varying schedules. It marks a crucial step in the right direction, and yet, it does not fully address the root of the problem: that students often don’t have access to the dining halls for food. In addition to a take-out container program, the University should institute a pilot program to have the dining halls — or at least one dining hall — open all hours of the day, which would increase accessibility to healthy food for students.
Today’s college students are extraordinarily busy, and USC students, whose days consist of circling in and out of classes, internships, organizations, work and studying, are no exception. For many students, sit-down meals during normal business hours are the stuff of fantasy. Moreover, all on-campus dining halls close at 10 p.m. A plurality of students often don’t have time to grab dinner until late at night.
Even during the day, students often don’t have time to dedicate upwards of half an hour to visit a dining hall during regular hours. If they aren’t able to sit down and eat in between classes during the day, they should at least have access to food at night. 
On top of this, students who have evening classes that end at 10 p.m., can’t even eat late dinners after a full day of classes or other commitments. For students with limited budgets or without access to larger refrigerators and spaces to store supermarket purchases, some of the only options for late-night food are the fast food restaurants around campus.
The poor nutrition stemming from limited food access can yield a severely adverse health impact. Students that go without dinner until 10 p.m. might substitute that meal with a bag of chips at Trojan Grounds or a candy bar from a vending machine, beginning unhealthy meal consumption practices. Left without nutritious options, students begin to regularly replace meals with sugary alternatives. And studies like a 2014 report by Wilder Research consistently shows that poor nutrition in college students significantly decreases focus, energy and quality of life.
And further, while the University does provide what counts as 24-hour service in the form of Trojan Grounds, and other late-night food options are available via off-campus eateries or use of food delivery services such as Postmates or Tapingo, spending on food in excess of students’ dining plans, which on average cost $2,950, is not an option for students with less economic privilege. At USC, the option of leading a healthy lifestyle should not be reserved for students who have more free time and financial resources.
In the same vein of affordability and economic efficiency, allowing dining halls to operate overnight would permit students to eat under the full generosity of their meal plans, which can cost anywhere from $350 to $3,270. Ultimately, increasing access to dining halls is not just a nutrition issue — it is also an equity issue. Financially disadvantaged students face far fewer options to get food when dining halls are closed, and are disproportionately hurt by limited access. 
Currently, the USG resolution that would allow students to take home food from dining halls awaits approval from the administration. Previous efforts to implement a similar policy have failed due to liability concerns. In other words, USC may be concerned that students could fail to properly preserve or eat the food they take from dining halls in a timely matter, and blame the University for health detriments as a result of this. To that end, the University should consider creating a waiver form required by all students with meal plans in order to take food out of the dining halls. 
Another option available to students struggling with food insecurity and the dining hall’s current, limiting hours and carry-out policies is Dornsife’s Virtual Food Pantry program, which connects students with financial struggles with gift cards to local grocery stores. 
In passing this take-out resolution on Tuesday evening, student government took an important step to addressing the USC dining hall system’s flaws and promoting student health. But this must be the first step to make nutritious meals and dining options as accessible to students as possible. The collegiate experience is already fraught with a wide range of challenges, stressors and barriers to student mental and physical health. Food insecurity for students who have already paid thousands of dollars for meal plans should not be one of these.

Last time I looked, this was a University and not a Carnival cruise and eating throughout the night at the midnight buffet is not a right that anyone owes you.   First it was takeout containers from the dining halls and now it’s all night eating.   When will this give me, give me and give me more for free attitude going to end?
What about the poor people that will be required to work through the night making French fries and greasy burgers to keep you over-fed at 3am?   Maybe these workers would rather be home with their families and not working the overnight shift with you and your loud and obnoxious friends smelling of cheap beer and marijuana after a night of partying?
Please ladies, eating late at night is sure fire way to gain those extra pounds that might keep you from finding Mr. Right.  I have seen all too many pretty girls at the fraternity tailgates already looking chubby and a fourth meal is not going to help any of you look fit and trim as you should.   We ladies have responsibility to look the best we can and overeating is not the way to achieve this.   Not to mention the health problems from you being over-weight will undoubtedly occur later in life becoming a burden to everyone else who didn’t require a fourth daily meal.    I don’t want my family to have to pay for your laundry list of health problems such as diabetes, heart disease and many other preventable health issues because you want to eat day and night.
I’m sorry to say I have noticed some distinct differences in the college girls today and when I was in college.  First, we never left the dorm room or sorority house without taking a few moments to look presentable in public.   Hair, make-up, proper clothing and appropriate footwear.    Hair tied up in bun, flip flops and a baggy sweat suit is not going to help you find a suitable man.
  You ladies can all do better and more food isn’t the answer!
My son and I are going to pray for you all.
God Bless
According to a study published by the University of Wisconsin in association with the CDC, an 8-year study of university students showed that students who regularly consumed meals between the hours of 9pm and 4am were over 17% more likely to become obese while in college and were 34% more likely to have a significant deficiency in key vitamins and minerals including iron and thiamine.

I grew up on then-President George W. Bush jokes. “Is our children learning?” “Do we struggle to put food on our family?” At that time, it appeared we had perhaps weathered our worst president — a well-meaning Good Ol’ Boy cornered and manipulated by factions, family and then-Vice President Dick Cheney, who would have sadly made such a terrific baseball commissioner but instead became such a dangerously misguided leader. Still, I do truly believe that W. meant well; I do believe he held his country — and his role as the president — in high regard; I do believe he was interested in making the right decisions, even if he was so often incapable of doing so. Thus, it appears we may have dearly “misunderestimated” what the worst American president could and would really look like.
So it comes almost ironically to see Bush, in his most recent speech, characterize the country as one in which “bigotry seems emboldened,” referring of course to the recent vitality of populist outrage from President Donald Trump and his base. But more importantly, Bush’s Thursday speech was an interesting choice for broader reasons. It reflected what seems to be the national ethos among many conservatives who find themselves dismayed at the growing extremism of the ideology.
To observe Bush as he returns to the front pages is to remember a time when a president who himself was distressing to the nation still stood for a conservatism far different than the brand we observe today. To sympathize with our own conservative classmates, family members and co-workers who believe in the core of that ideology but still do not buy into the circus that is the Trump administration is to recognize that polarization has less to do with the ideology itself, and much more to do with the movement of its leadership into the extreme.
Of course, a return to centrism, as I have said before, is necessary to create even the most incremental change and continue to advocate on behalf of important reform. Nonetheless, I do not consider both major American political ideologies to command equal weight either of effectuality or principle. 
But the crisis of the one party attempting to rule alone is evidence of its choice to embrace extremism, and with it, its extreme president. It is alarming to remember the multitude of crises the congressional GOP has allowed to go by the wayside: Sexual assault admitted on tape; multiple conflicts of interest, most of them remaining to this day; inept handling of national disasters and crises; goading of a dangerous military dictator; praising of other dangerous military dictators; daily gaffes and national embarrassments; disappointment of our overseas allies; ties to enemy foreign operatives; international interference in sovereign elections; and the list goes on. 
And Bush, a true conservative, especially compared with the president and our ultra-pragmatic, vengeful, short-sighted congressional leadership, recognizes it.
The best thing about Bush — and about his comments — is that he arose out of a time when conservatism did not bend so strongly to its Tea Party ends, when it was more concerned with its Burkean roots than its desire to make dimwitted attempts at exacting a vicious revenge against social progress. He has witnessed and recognizes that shift.
“We have seen our discourse degraded by casual cruelty,” Bush said. “At times, it can seem like the forces pulling us apart are stronger than the forces binding us together.”
Bush’s comments are important in the conversation around returns to centrism, especially in the wake of 2016 — mostly serving to point out that American conservatism has not always been characterized by the lunacy we see today, and to conflate true conservative values with Trumpian populism is deeply unfortunate in the long-standing political traditions of this country. At the same time, however, when the party leadership seems to be ordering full speed ahead toward a strange quasi-religious, anti-intellectual extremism, it’s hard to see how conservatism is not just being bastardized in the moment, but evolving toward its eventual future. 
It also goes to show that the reaction against Trump and his movement, and Trump and his party’s congressional politics, is not simply the reaction of a progressive America bucking against the leadership of someone with whom they only artificially disagree — in a way, Bush has always maintained very quietly his place as a dissenting true conservative observing the populist wave.
It is always refreshing to see a seasoned American politician, especially a former president, use their voice to shift the public narrative toward a recognition of extremism rather than its embrace. Until we observe a time when the pendulum swings back, and our politics do not always appear so shocking and somber, we can all remember and hold dear W.’s words after Trump’s inauguration, a line more eloquent than any of his presidency: “That was some weird sh-t.” 
Lily Vaughan is a junior majoring in history and political science. Her column,“Playing Politics,” runs Fridays.
As unemployment falls and the GDP rises amidst a soaring DJIA, Trump is MAGA despite the GOP Bush swampmeisters and other idiot globalist centrists whose hysteria should be ignored.
What’s next?  Will Obama emerge from the swamp, too?  We are in this position today thanks to those two “leaders.”
Here we go again…
Show some class and depth.

“People want to know — how do we resist hate in America?” 
That’s what USC history professor Steven Ross said the appeal of his latest book was. Although the nonfiction historical work explores a spy group’s efforts to combat fascist groups in America in the mid-1900s, Ross said the ideas apply more generally to how hate becomes popular and how governments can be complicit in it. 
Titled Hitler in Los Angeles: How Jews Foiled Nazi Plots Against Hollywood and America, the book is set for release Tuesday. The work follows the journey of attorney Leon Lewis and the spy group he created to infiltrate and prevent fascist groups in Los Angeles from carrying out plots to kill Hollywood professionals and Jews living in the area.

Ross first began exploring Lewis and his operation while conducting research for his last book Hollywood Left and Right: How Movie Stars Shaped American Politics, which was nominated for a Pulitzer Prize, according to his Dornsife faculty profile.
“I wanted to learn more about Hollywood’s response to Nazism, so I found an online exhibit from Cal State Northridge, called ‘In Our Own Backyard’ that documented fascist and Nazi activity in L.A.,” Ross said. “I went out to the library there and discovered there were over 200 boxes, filled with these reports, and it was just too much for what was going to be a page in a book. So I said when I was finished with Hollywood Left and Right, I would go back to Northridge and try to figure out what the story was. So that’s what I did.”
Ross started working on Hitler in Los Angeles in 2011, following the completion of his last book. According to Ross, he researched and wrote the book over the course of five years, finishing the manuscript in December 2016. 
At first, Ross had trouble piecing together Lewis’ story with the documents he found at Cal State Northridge because most information about the spy operation was kept secret. He finally made a breakthrough by returning to USC, where he found detailed papers kept by Joe Roos, who worked closely with Lewis in his spying operation, Ross said. 
“After reading 30 pages of [Roos’ papers], I knew exactly what the story was, because he explained exactly what was going on, and at that point I knew I had a thriller,” Ross said. “Not just a history book, but a thriller.”
Beyond the fascinating nature of the content, Ross said he wrote the book because he has a personal history with the Nazis’ actions. 
“My parents are both Holocaust survivors,” Ross said. “My mother had been in Auschwitz, and my father in Dachau, and from childhood on, I wondered how all this could happen, and my childhood self asked, ‘Why didn’t Jews do more to fight [Adolf] Hitler?’”
Throughout his research, however, Ross found that his question was a commonly held misconception about Jewish action against Nazism. Many historians, including Ross initially, believed American Jews didn’t do enough to fight Hitler’s actions. But the real problem, he realized, wasn’t Jewish complacency, but rather a lack of action on the part of the American government partly because of its preoccupation with combating communism at home.
“I realized that I had been asking the wrong questions, as had many decades of historians,” Ross said. “What I found was that Jews were very active in combating Hitler … the real villain of this era isn’t Jewish complacency, but the American government and their obsession with finding ‘reds’ in America, and their virtual, total ignoring of Nazis and fascists in America.”

Conversely, Ross said the people who spied for Lewis saw Jews not as a separate group, but as Americans. 
“[Of] the spies, the men and women who went to help Leon Lewis, only one was a Jew,” Ross said. “Everyone else was a Christian. And they believed they were fighting not on behalf of Jews, they were fighting on behalf of Americans. As far as they were concerned, the notion of the hyphenated American — the Jewish-American, the Catholic-American, the Black-American — the first part of the hyphen was an adjective, and what mattered was the noun, American, and they did not want to see one group attacking another group of Americans.”
Even before publication, the book is gaining widespread attention. Ross’ work has been featured in The New Yorker and the Los Angeles Times. He attributes this attention to the presence of fascist groups in Los Angeles during WWII, which holds a stark similarity to the rise of modern-day hate groups. 
“It’s a story of what happens when hate groups move from the margins to the mainstream of American society, and when government authorities are either complacent or complicit in it,” Ross said. “I think my book is a warning. It’s both a story of the past and a warning of the present, because [what we see now is] not real Nazis but neo-Nazis, not Klan members but white supremacists.”
Could also write about Final Solution was developed when ships full of Jews were denied entry by other countries including USA
I eagerly anticipate the release of this book but my concern is that the political polarity may be confused. 
Hitler, leader of the National Socialist Party was initially aligned with Stalin, head of the largest Communist party where everyone is beholden to the “state”. These bedfellows resided together on the extreme left side of societal-political spectrum.
The “ Far Right” is led by anarchists who are beholden to nobody. It is a shame that our media and intelligencia commingle the right and fascist national socialists. The sooner we all figure this out, the sooner we fix the problems facing our wonderful country.
And how many wealthy families of Europe and the US backed or supported Hitler when it was fashionable? He was Time magazine’s Man of the Year. Joe Kennedy made millions by selling Hitler medical supplies. JP Morgan, the Rockefellers and the Rothchilds made millions by financing the Nazi buildup. It was surprising that by the time the Pulitzer Peace Prize committee was ready to award it Hitler, he was outed as being a killer and they withdrew his name from consideration. Go figure. How can a person be awarded the PPP  without doing a darn thing?  Oh wait. Obama!
Well put!
Perhaps your next book could be about the Communist Party USA and it’s infiltration into American politics and Hollywood. It would make for a great read, too.

Two USC alumni developed the app Heal with the intent of making health care more convenient.
Launched in 2014, Heal was founded by Renee Dua and Greg Drobnick. Their goal was to utilize locational technology to deliver medical specialists to customers.

Dua, the chief medical officer at Heal, participated in a fellowship at USC in 2003, with a focus on nephrology, the study of kidneys and hypertension. She also co-founded the application with her husband, and Drobnick, a USC graduate, later joined Heal as its external vice president of strategic initiatives.
As former students, the two recognized the lack of access to medical resources for students, and Dua aimed to set Heal apart from other medical options through availability and convenience in its services.
“Student health services [aren’t] necessarily open on nights or weekends [at suitable hours],” Dua said. “[Heal is] open seven days a week from 8 a.m. to 8 p.m.”
Currently available in populated areas of California, including Los Angeles County, Long Beach, Orange County, San Diego and the San Francisco Bay Area, Heal was envisioned to be a new system for health care, Dua said, with doctors available 365 days a year.
“It is the house call,” Dua said. “A patient can use an app to schedule a visit with a doctor as his or her personal location. It’s an essential change in the delivery of health care. Usually, you need to go to the doctor. What we’re doing is making that different. The doctor comes to you.”
The original idea behind Heal came from Dua, after she experienced a scare with her son’s pediatrician, who told her to rush her toddler to the emergency room after he developed a rash. Dua was told her son would be fine,  but only after an eight-hour wait.
The increasing wait times to see doctors, Drobnick said, creates a need for services like Heal. 
Doctor wait times in 15 metropolitan markets are an average of 24 days in length, a 30 percent increase from 2014, according to a study by Merritt Hawkins.
“At the push of a button, you can have an excellent doctor at your dorm, your sorority or fraternity house, your apartment — wherever it is you are,” Drobnick said. “Our promise to students is that we will arrive in under two hours.” 
As goods and services are increasingly delivered, Drobnick recognized Heal as an innovative use of technology in a field that desperately needs it. 
“We set out to create a service that would help streamline a lot and use great technologies … to make that process of seeing a doctor easier,” Drobnick said. 
Drobnick also highlighted the utility of Heal for out-of-state or international students.
“The most important thing is that [students] need access to health care just like everybody else does, and you can use [Heal] to see a doctor for almost any reason, [except emergencies],” Dua said.

“It’s an out-of-body experience,” Justin Epstein, a junior majoring in dance, said. “I feel like my body is a form that is moving through space, but my soul is interacting with audience members and people on stage. It’s more than just the confines of my skin.” 
Epstein vividly recalled the feelings he experienced while performing in “Making Movements: Dance and Social Change,” a collaboration performance made possible by the Glorya Kaufman School of Dance and USC Visions and Voices. Epstein was one of 32 other Kaufman students in the filled-to-capacity show, which ran at 6:30 p.m. and again at 8:30 p.m. on Wednesday night.
The production’s primary objective was to showcase the power of dance in interpreting and dealing with pressing social issues. The students performed the show in three parts, with each telling its own story about the human condition. 
The first section — which included all participating Kaufman students — focused on a variety of societal concerns and highlighted racism in particular. Accompanied by the narration of a spoken-word poem, the piece underlined the ability of dance to reach different people through its universality. 
The poem continued to run in the background as the number of dancers decreased from 32 to four. Each performer expressed his or her own interpretation of the work through movement, heavily emphasizing how dance can heal the discord between conflicting identities. Quite fittingly, the piece ended with the simple statement, “No more bricks that form walls / Only bridges that connect us all.” 
The third segment continued this uplifting sentiment, as performers rejoined the stage to form a semicircle and took turns dancing in the middle. Whether it be a solo or a dance-off, Bollywood or ballet, every student was met with the same encouraging cheers from his or her fellow dancers. 
While each dancer has his or her own specific area of practice, the first and second sections were hip-hop performances, specifically showcasing West Coast popping and waving. 
In Epstein’s opinion, hip-hop — honest and emotional in its raw form — is particularly effective in bridging social divides. “Hip-hop is the dance of the people, the dance of the masses,” Epstein said. “It is that transverse span that can bring people together and unify them to move forward and tackle the oppressing issues that we have right now.” 
The Kaufman students’ routine was created by professional dancer and choreographer Jon Boogz, who came to USC after working with Visions and Voices last year. Boogz, a well-known force in the dance community, has had his choreographies featured on So You Think You Can Dance and has worked with artists such as Mikhail Baryshnikov and Gloria Estefan. 
Boogz was featured as the night’s main attraction. In fact, audiences were introduced to the show with Boogz’s opening piece “Am I a Man,” a short film that focuses on the racial imbalances embedded in the nation’s mass incarceration. Bryan Stevenson, a leading attorney and civil rights activist, narrated Boogz and his partner Charles “Lil Buck” Riley’s dance with relevant facts and statistics on the topic.
“You need collaborations,” Boogz said. “Bryan is a real lawyer for mass incarceration, and I’m blessed to know him and be connected to him. I’m always trying to figure out who else we can involve, who can amplify this project and take it to another level. I’m always looking for that extra ‘it’ factor that can take it over the top to give [the topic] that much more validation and that much more authenticity.”
The video seamlessly transitioned into Boogz’s solo “Love Heals All Wounds,” which depicted a man hardened by the social injustices currently plaguing his society. 
As the piece progressed, Boogz’s character eventually became more open to positivity, ultimately realizing that love is the answer to the world’s problems.
To Boogz, the discomforting topics he introduces are made more palatable by dance. Building on Epstein’s previous comment, the choreographer said he believes that dance can not only unify different groups on difficult issues, but also encourage them to start discussing these topics in the first place.
“I think dance has the power to speak to people in the way that words can’t,” Boogz said. “Movement is the most primal form of communication. Sometimes if I have an opinion on something, people may not want to hear it. But when you tell it through music, movement and expression, I just think it creates an entry point aesthetically that allows people to digest the topic that normally wouldn’t be too easy to talk about.”
In its entirety, “Making Movements: Dance and Social Change” taught audiences that the roles of the artist and the activist are not mutually exclusive. Both the students’ and Boogz’s performances underscored the power of dance to expand audience members’ viewpoints, encouraging a sense of open-mindedness and a desire for social action. 
“We can use dance to create change,” Boogz said. “Whether it’s a big change or a small change, it really doesn’t matter. Dance is more than entertainment — dance has the ability to inspire, educate, heal, liberate, and create social impact.”

“It’s an out-of-body experience,” Justin Epstein, a junior majoring in dance, said. “I feel like my body is a form that is moving through space, but my soul is interacting with audience members and people on stage. It’s more than just the confines of my skin.” 
Epstein vividly recalled the feelings he experienced while performing in “Making Movements: Dance and Social Change,” a collaboration performance made possible by the Glorya Kaufman School of Dance and USC Visions and Voices. Epstein was one of 32 other Kaufman students in the filled-to-capacity show, which ran at 6:30 p.m. and again at 8:30 p.m. on Wednesday night.
The production’s primary objective was to showcase the power of dance in interpreting and dealing with pressing social issues. The students performed the show in three parts, with each telling its own story about the human condition. 
The first section — which included all participating Kaufman students — focused on a variety of societal concerns and highlighted racism in particular. Accompanied by the narration of a spoken-word poem, the piece underlined the ability of dance to reach different people through its universality. 
The poem continued to run in the background as the number of dancers decreased from 32 to four. Each performer expressed his or her own interpretation of the work through movement, heavily emphasizing how dance can heal the discord between conflicting identities. Quite fittingly, the piece ended with the simple statement, “No more bricks that form walls / Only bridges that connect us all.” 
The third segment continued this uplifting sentiment, as performers rejoined the stage to form a semicircle and took turns dancing in the middle. Whether it be a solo or a dance-off, Bollywood or ballet, every student was met with the same encouraging cheers from his or her fellow dancers. 
While each dancer has his or her own specific area of practice, the first and second sections were hip-hop performances, specifically showcasing West Coast popping and waving. 
In Epstein’s opinion, hip-hop — honest and emotional in its raw form — is particularly effective in bridging social divides. “Hip-hop is the dance of the people, the dance of the masses,” Epstein said. “It is that transverse span that can bring people together and unify them to move forward and tackle the oppressing issues that we have right now.” 
The Kaufman students’ routine was created by professional dancer and choreographer Jon Boogz, who came to USC after working with Visions and Voices last year. Boogz, a well-known force in the dance community, has had his choreographies featured on So You Think You Can Dance and has worked with artists such as Mikhail Baryshnikov and Gloria Estefan. 
Boogz was featured as the night’s main attraction. In fact, audiences were introduced to the show with Boogz’s opening piece “Am I a Man,” a short film that focuses on the racial imbalances embedded in the nation’s mass incarceration. Bryan Stevenson, a leading attorney and civil rights activist, narrated Boogz and his partner Charles “Lil Buck” Riley’s dance with relevant facts and statistics on the topic.
“You need collaborations,” Boogz said. “Bryan is a real lawyer for mass incarceration, and I’m blessed to know him and be connected to him. I’m always trying to figure out who else we can involve, who can amplify this project and take it to another level. I’m always looking for that extra ‘it’ factor that can take it over the top to give [the topic] that much more validation and that much more authenticity.”
The video seamlessly transitioned into Boogz’s solo “Love Heals All Wounds,” which depicted a man hardened by the social injustices currently plaguing his society. 
As the piece progressed, Boogz’s character eventually became more open to positivity, ultimately realizing that love is the answer to the world’s problems.
To Boogz, the discomforting topics he introduces are made more palatable by dance. Building on Epstein’s previous comment, the choreographer said he believes that dance can not only unify different groups on difficult issues, but also encourage them to start discussing these topics in the first place.
“I think dance has the power to speak to people in the way that words can’t,” Boogz said. “Movement is the most primal form of communication. Sometimes if I have an opinion on something, people may not want to hear it. But when you tell it through music, movement and expression, I just think it creates an entry point aesthetically that allows people to digest the topic that normally wouldn’t be too easy to talk about.”
In its entirety, “Making Movements: Dance and Social Change” taught audiences that the roles of the artist and the activist are not mutually exclusive. Both the students’ and Boogz’s performances underscored the power of dance to expand audience members’ viewpoints, encouraging a sense of open-mindedness and a desire for social action. 
“We can use dance to create change,” Boogz said. “Whether it’s a big change or a small change, it really doesn’t matter. Dance is more than entertainment — dance has the ability to inspire, educate, heal, liberate, and create social impact.”

College is a constant push and pull between expanding my identity and clinging onto old memories that shaped my childhood. A blossoming appreciation for the opportunities I have in college, but occasionally regretting the missed experiences that are inevitable when moving away. One of the most memorable and quintessential parts of my childhood was celebrating Diwali, the Indian Festival of Lights. During the month of October, my parents and I would go to a Diwali party, if not multiple, every weekend. The schedule would be decided months in advance, with squabbles over who got to host on which date resolved back in April.
Every year, almost without fail, my family hosts our own Diwali party, with a preparation process that is an experience in and of itself. My mother spends weeks working out the menu, taking requests from family and friends to make her legendary dishes. My grandma and mother share the kitchen, divvying up the responsibilities between desserts and appetizers, and my dad and I would pop in to lick the bowl of condensed milk or steal a kachori, a spicy Indian snack.
When I was younger, my mom would draw out the Rangoli, the art with colored rice and powder that you put in front of your door. My little hands would mess up her intricately drawn designs. Over the years, I learned from her. My hands became more stable, and it was finally my responsibility to draw all the designs. I put out the diyas, little tea-light candles, all around the house. I would walk around in my Indian clothes, seeing the entire house lit up, soaking in the silence before our house was filled with laughs and hugs and full stomachs.
Diwali may be the festival of lights, but for me, it was always, and continues to be a celebration of community. While it sounds cliche, they say it takes a village to raise a child, and this night was always a gathering of my village. Everyone who came to this night played a role in defining my identity, whether I saw them every weekend or once a year.
Every vivid detail has been etched into my mind, an amalgam of my experiences over the years. The laughs of excitement, as we wrote our names with the sparklers, across the background of the dark sky. The little beads and sparkles that would be left on our floor from our Indian clothes. The sounds of our bangles clinking against each other, as we ran from one room to another, playing hide and seek. The taste of my Mom’s paneer and Biryani, and my uncles and aunts going back to get more food, while chorusing, “I’m stuffed.” And finally, getting permission from my parents to change out of my itchy Indian clothes, just to watch the parents play cards into the early hours of the morning.
I haven’t been able to go home for Diwali in the past few years. Since I go to school relatively close to home, my parents expected that this would be one of the experiences I wouldn’t miss. Unfortunately, both years, my Model United Nations team has had our conference on the same weekend as my parents’ party. If not for the incessant calls I got from my family, urging me to come home and the isolation I feel from seeing the pictures at my house, I would say that this coincidence is serendipitous. The night that was an assemblage of my community back home has now become a celebration of one of my most important communities here at USC.
This weekend, as I run from room to room, imagining scenarios for a post-Cold-War National Security Council, I will undoubtedly get hit with bursts of nostalgia, as my family friends dress up in their lenghas and my mom reminds me of the food I’m missing. But I’ll also be thankful that I have those experiences painted so vividly in my mind, and that I can hold them close to me as I make new memories. I will carry those relationships and memories with me throughout my college career. My parents will always welcome me with open arms, reminding me that I will always have a place to call home, and a night to celebrate the people who made me who I am — even if I won’t always be there to physically experience it.

Maintaining the ever-so-subtle balancing act between lush pop balladry and intricate indie singalongs, the London-based alt-pop duo Oh Wonder demonstrated true versatility during their concert at the Shrine Auditorium on Wednesday night. 
Performing a selection of tracks from their 2015 self-titled debut album, as well as their 2017 album Ultralife, Oh Wonder gave attendees an all-encompassing taste of their complete discography. With fan favorites including “Drive” and “Lose It” receiving screams of adoration echoing throughout a crowd of 4,000 people, Oh Wonder left little to be desired.
Backed by a live drummer and bassist, as well as an elaborate array of lighting displays, the duo — comprising vocalists Josephine Vander Gucht and Anthony West — exhibited genuine showmanship, withholding the audience’s unwavering attention throughout the 75-minute set. Countering the synth-heavy and down-tempo duo-arrangement of “Waste,” with the upbeat, full band performance of “Body Gold,” Oh Wonder’s carefully executed shift in dynamics consistently kept the audience on its toes.
 Since playing their first ever gig outside of the U.K. at West Hollywood’s 500-person club, the Troubadour, only two years ago, the momentousness of Wednesday evening’s show was evident throughout Oh Wonder’s set. Performing in front of a nearly sold-out Shrine crowd, the band’s growth in popularity, as well as in musicianship, was on clear display. 
“After two years of touring, somehow, you’ve multiplied in size to fill the Shrine,” Vander Gucht enthusiastically announced to the audience. 
Expressing gratitude for this remarkable and unlikely feat, Vander Gucht reminisced on the group’s humble beginnings. 
“We never thought it would get any better than that, and somehow this evening, it just has,” he said. 
Before launching into a sparse arrangement of the piano-driven ballad, “All We Do,” — one of the evening’s many poignant moments — Vander Gucht recollected upon Oh Wonder’s past once more and offered words of wisdom to those in attendance.
“Anything that you guys think is entirely impossible, that is out of your reach, all of that stuff is entirely irrelevant,” Vander Gucht said. “If we can somehow end up at the other side of the world singing in front of 4,000 people, you can do anything.” 
Before exiting the stage for a final time, Oh Wonder left fans with parting words that alluded to their future plans: they announced that they will be returning to Los Angeles for six weeks in January to record their third studio album. 
“We can’t wait to come hang out in this amazing city and be inspired by all of you,” Vander Gucht said, beaming with excitement.
Showing profound appreciation for the city that helped propel them on their path to stardom, Oh Wonder thanked the crowd one last time before closing the show with their 2017 album title-track “Ultralife” and 2015 seminal hit “Drive.” While Oh Wonder may have reached what many would deem the pinnacle of a band’s career — a packed house at the historic Shrine Auditorium — Wednesday evening’s set proved that they are just now getting started. 
Satisfying their true headlining potential, Oh Wonder’s performance furthered their status as an alt-pop force to be reckoned with — a force that is here to stay.

There is no doubting the historical appeal of the Notre Dame-USC rivalry, which dates back to 1926. But this weekend’s game carries a little extra juice than normal. No. 11 USC and No. 13 Notre Dame both enter highly ranked and with one loss, with Saturday’s game acting not only as a rivalry matchup but also as a College Football Playoff eliminator. 
“It’s really neat to have the two teams where we are right now,” head coach Clay Helton said. “Nationally ranked, a big game with a lot on the line. It reminds me a lot of how our game versus Penn State was in the Rose Bowl. It’s two teams when they’re playing well, it’s great for the game.” 
For USC, the question will be if it can turn in its first complete game against a ranked opponent since its Week 2 romping of Stanford. Against Utah last week, the Trojans fumbled three times in the first quarter and trailed by 14 at the half, while Utes running back Zach Moss gashed USC’s defense for 113 first half rushing yards. But in the second half, the team as a whole turned a switch. Redshirt sophomore quarterback Sam Darnold did not turn the ball over for the rest of the game, captaining three long scoring drives, while the defense gave up just one score. 
“I look forward to putting a full game together, like we did in that second half,” Helton said. “Showing that type of football, that clean, hard-nosed attitude that those kids had … It’s going to be needed in this game.” 
Perhaps the biggest challenge for the Trojans as they play on the road in South Bend, Ind., will be containing an elite Fighting Irish rushing attack with a depleted defensive line. While Helton expects junior defensive lineman Rasheem Green to play through an ankle injury suffered against Utah, it was a rough week for the nose tackle position. Having already lost highly touted freshman Marlon Tuipulotu to season ending back surgery, junior Josh Fatu suffered a concussion after being involved in a car accident and redshirt senior Kenny Bigelow officially transitioned to a non-football role after two previous knee surgeries. 
Now starting at nose tackle is Alaskan freshman Brandon Pili. In his first career start, Pili will be tasked with penetrating an experienced Irish offensive line and curtailing a ground attack led by junior running back Josh Adams and junior quarterback Brandon Wimbush. Adams has rushed for 776 yards on nine yards per carry, while Wimbush has run for 402 yards and eight touchdowns in a dual threat role. 
“[Notre Dame head coach Brian Kelly] had DeShone Kizer the last couple of years and leaned on the passing game,” Helton said. “This year, you can tell he’s got two runners — one is the quarterback and one’s the big back. They’re spreading you out in three wide sets and running for 308 yards per game.” 
Compounding Notre Dame’s revamped ground and pound offense, is a stout run defense that has given up just one rushing touchdown all year. In their 20-19 loss to Georgia, the Irish held both Nick Chubb and Sony Michel to under 100 yards. Junior tackles Chuma Edoga and Toa Lobendahn are expected to play through various injuries, but freshman running back Stephen Carr remains out with a foot injury. With the Irish secondary ranking No. 78 in passing yards allowed per game, Saturday’s clash may come down to Darnold’s arm. 
In addition to the emergence of freshman wide receiver Tyler Vaughns as a threat over the past three games, USC’s deep tight end corps has done an excellent job of alleviating pressure on go-to slot man Deontay Burnett. Helton has confidence in four players, who will all play a significant number of snaps against Notre Dame. 
“[Sophomore tight end Daniel Imatorbhebhe] helped us for about 12 plays last week,” Helton said. “We look forward to that number increasing as he gets healthy and more confident …That position right now is really stockpiled when you look at it with a lot of great talent. Not only do you have Daniel but you have Tyler [Petite], who’s having his best year by far, you’ve got the emergence of Josh Falo, who’s made two touchdown catches in the last two games and then you’ve got Erik Krommenhoek, who’s done the dirty work.” 
When USC heads to South Bend, Ind., for the 86th edition of a storied rivalry, more than the Jeweled Shillelagh hangs in the balance, as both schools fight to remain alive in the national title conversation. 
“It’s the best intersectional rivalry in all of college sports today,” Helton said. “Everybody wants to win this so they can leave their mark in history.”

One storyline has dominated the pregame hype as No. 11 USC prepares for a road trip to No. 13 Notre Dame: the College Football Playoff elimination game. Saturday’s primetime tilt matches up two one-loss teams in the top 15, so this makes sense. Whether it’s the Trojans or the Fighting Irish, one team will see its playoff dreams shattered this weekend.
Funnily enough, from the two programs’ perspectives, most games this season have been elimination games. A two-loss team has never made the playoff, so USC has been playing for its postseason life ever since its loss to Washington State last month. Notre Dame has been punching its way off the ropes since Week 2, when it suffered a narrow loss to now-No. 3 Georgia. A victory for either side on Saturday would simply be another step in a marathon campaign with no margin for error.
It’s this reality that seems to have held the Trojans back at times this fall. Last season’s swashbuckling squad played with no fear after a disastrous start to the season eliminated all expectations, but this year’s team has occasionally appeared paralyzed by its high hopes. Even while flashing the same explosiveness that catapulted it to Rose Bowl glory in 2016, USC has also unraveled at points — like last week, when a backward pass that hit junior running back Ronald Jones II in the facemask fell to the grass and resulted in a turnover.
We’ve been waiting all year for the Trojans to right the ship and eliminate the inexplicable missteps. Perhaps this so-called elimination game on Saturday will be the cure. For USC, every other game this season has brought much to lose and little to gain, as heavy-underdog teams arrived amped up and hungry for an upset. For maybe the first time this fall, the Trojans have an opportunity to play for something other than simple survival: destroying the Irish.
But giving Notre Dame a season-ending loss won’t be easy. Not only do the Irish rank above USC in multiple key categories like total defense and turnover margin, but they are also playing at home following a bye week. The Trojans, meanwhile, will be playing their eighth consecutive week of football after jumping three time zones en route to South Bend. Taking on a fresh opponent in a hostile environment, head coach Clay Helton and his squad face a tall challenge. Can they rise to it?
The first candidate could be Jones, whose front flip into the end zone gave USC the fourth-quarter lead last Saturday. The junior has found pay dirt in every game he has played in this season (he sat out the team’s trip to Cal in late September), and he broke the 100-yard benchmark for the fourth time in 2017 against Utah. Unfortunately for Jones, Notre Dame has allowed just a single rushing touchdown all year. That’s even fewer than Alabama — or any other program in the nation, for that matter.
So if Jones can expect tough sledding in South Bend, the weight falls on redshirt sophomore quarterback Sam Darnold to lead the Trojans to victory. It hasn’t been a dream season for the preseason Heisman Trophy favorite and potential top overall NFL Draft pick: Darnold lost three fumbles last week — though one came on Jones’ bone-headed drop — and he now has 14 giveaways on the year (nine interceptions and five lost fumbles). But Darnold also avoided a pick against the Utes, which marked the first time this season he managed to go a full game without being intercepted, and his 358 passing yards were Darnold’s highest total this fall excluding the Week 3 double-overtime victory against Texas.
These may seem like baby steps — perhaps unimpressive steps at that in view of Darnold’s incredible 2016 campaign. Nevertheless, it’s encouraging to see USC’s superstar signal-caller round into form, even slightly, as the team’s receiving corps finally comes together. Darnold will have six legitimate weapons at his disposal on Saturday: three wideouts in junior Deontay Burnett, redshirt freshman Tyler Vaughns and redshirt senior Steven Mitchell Jr. ,and three tight ends in junior Tyler Petite, true freshman Josh Falo and redshirt sophomore Daniel Imatorbhebhe, who appears to have finally shaken off a series of lower-body injuries that have dogged him all season. With a full stable of options, Darnold has no excuse not to produce against Notre Dame.
And USC will desperately need its Heisman-level star back on Saturday. The Fighting Irish boast the fifth-ranked rushing offense in the FBS, led by junior running back Josh Adams, who has the 10th-most rushing yards in the nation (776). Defensive coordinator Clancy Pendergast’s unit has been a major strength this year, but it is depleted going into its matchup with Notre Dame, especially after senior nose tackle Josh Fatu was ruled out with a concussion. Without getting proper rest (i.e. without lengthy offensive drives), the Trojan defense will struggle to contain the Irish attack.
In other words, USC must play a complete game to retain the Jeweled Shillelagh — I guess that comes as no surprise. Again, victory in South Bend wouldn’t even be a game-changer with four weeks still to go in the regular season.
But a loss would be catastrophic for either side, and the winning program will remember it for years to come. It’s time to play for spite as well as survival.

 With only one loss on the season, the top-ranked men’s water polo team looks to add yet another win to its current five-game winning streak on Saturday, when it faces UC Irvine. While the Trojans came out with the win in the two teams’ last meeting in September, they don’t necessarily want a repeat of that one-goal victory.
“I think we started a little bit flat in the last game, and we’re looking to change that,” senior utility James Walters said. “UCI is a good team, and I am not going to say we are expecting anything less from them. They just beat UCLA, who is a tough competitor for us as well, and they’re always going to give us a good game.”
Against UC Irvine in the Mountain Pacific Invitational last month, the Trojans had to battle from behind until the final two and a half minutes of the game, when a goal from sophomore 2-meter Matt Maier put USC ahead 10-9. After that, the defense held off the Anteaters until the final whistle, allowing the Trojans to move forward in the winners bracket of the tournament. Due to the tournament schedule, USC only found out it was playing UC Irvine the day before the match — the squad said it appreciates the extra preparation this time around.
“Last time, we didn’t really know we were playing them because it was between them and Santa Barbara,” senior driver Matteo Morelli said. “We’re prepared for them this week, and we know who their best players are. We know that their goalie is probably their best player, so we just have to move the ball around and score on him.” 
Matej Matijevic, UC Irvine’s senior goalie, was named to the All-Golden Coast Conference first team, and has saved 206 shots in 16 games so far this season.
The Trojans have had time to hone in on Matijevic’s weaknesses this week. The team had no official games over the weekend, instead holding its annual alumni game. While still a match, the team had a weekend off from competition and refine its game plan. 
“It helps us a lot because we had some extra time to train,” Walters said. “We had a full week where we could really go hard and get a lot of conditioning in, so this week we will be nice and rested and ready to go give it our all.” 
One of the ways the Trojans plan on improving from their last meeting with UC Irvine is by sharpening their defense. This has been the team’s goal for the season, as it looks to complement a strong offense and Cutino Award-winning goalie.
“[UCI] had a couple of good shooters, and we were leaving them open,” Morelli said. “They had some pretty good shots that our goalie couldn’t block. Play better defense, and the offense is going to come.” 
Walters echoed his teammate’s philosophy: letting the attack build out from the back.
“We are just looking to be solid on defense and play our game on offense,” he said. “[Then], the game will play out the way we want it to.” 
But even as the Trojans make adjustments and perfect their approach, they are looking to keep things simple — and keep the streak going. 
“There are lots of little things we’re going to work on,” Walters said. “We’re still playing water polo, we’re still doing our best and we’re still trying to win the game. That’s all it is.” 
USC will look for its sixth win in a row at 1 p.m. on Saturday.
