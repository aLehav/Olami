Because tens of thousands of fans cross Exposition Boulevard on game days, the Metro has developed a plan to keep those people safe once the station begins operations.
Safety first · The Los Angeles Metro will install barriers and place crossing guards at the Metro crossing on Exposition Boulevard to ensure fans’ safety on game days. - Engie Salama | Daily Trojan
The station is currently slated for completion in 2012.
Metro’s Deputy Executive Officer for Operations Bruce Shelburne said the organization completed several studies to observe pedestrian movement from Trousdale Parkway to the Rose Garden.
“We’re [going to have] crowd breaks while the crowd comes through,” Shelburne said. “We will control the crossing to prevent anybody from going in front of the train. We [will] put personnel in front of the people who are crossing and then move the train.”
Shelburne said Metro plans to erect barricades for the group of thousands that follows the Trojan Marching Band, which itself usually takes about two-and-a-half minutes to cross the street.
“We’ll allow a couple of minutes for folks to pass through and Exposition is still closed,” Shelburne said. “We’ll put up a barricade on each side to make sure nobody gets in the way of the train, which only takes a minute or so [to erect], then open it up again.”
Exposition Boulevard currently allows Trojan Transportation buses to pass through on game days, but restricts traffic somewhat to allow pedestrians to cross.
Some students said the plan doesn’t seem significant.
“The measures will [not] be that big of a deal,” said Shehzad Husnani, a freshman majoring in aerospace engineering. “I believe it’s worth it because safety is important and waiting two extra minutes to make sure everyone is safe is really nothing.”
There will be two other stations near campus, one at Vermont Avenue and Exposition Boulevard and the other at Jefferson Boulevard and Figueroa Street. The station at Figueroa is planned to have a bridge over the street for pedestrians to cross.
“There are also additional safety features, such as markings and LED train signs,” Metro spokesman Rick Jager said. “Our most important goal is to make sure everybody is safe.”
Some students said these safety features assured them that the dollars going toward construction were being well-spent.
“It’s worth the money,” said Tommy Waas, a freshman majoring in screenwriting. “Better to do that than risk someone getting hurt.”
Phase one of the $2.4-billion Expo line project, connecting Culver City to Downtown Los Angeles, was completed this year. Currently, Metro is testing out the trains and plans to officially open phase one to the public in early 2012.
“We’re having a pre-construction phase [for the second phase], doing activities such as, potholing and surveying,” said Gabriela Collins, community relations manager for Exposition Construction Authority. “Construction will start early next year and be completed in 2015.”

Honestly, this was the only thing that worried me about putting an at-grade crossing at Trousdale. I was totally down to toss in the $300 mil to extend the tunnel to pass under Trousdale (not to mention get the fancier architecture at the USC stops…) but as long as the Metro yields to the TMB, I can deal. One does not simply break the ranks of the TMB. Drunken tailgaters (and other pedestrians) on the other hand better watch out. I don’t want to read about anyone getting hit by a train at USC. I’m glad to know the crossing will be staffed to control the traffic. 
Though I’d still rather have the train underground. We’ll see how the above plan goes, then maybe I’ll pick up the bill for the tunnel (and putting the Expo Line on hold for a couple months) in a few years or so. 
Fight on, and remember: left-right-left.
Isn’t the third station station near campus on Flower (not Figueroa) street?
So… why is Engie Salama still writing for the Daily Trojan? Was her trainwreck of an article on Tuesday not offensive and embarrassing enough? That aside, she seems unable to construct a cogent sentence. Please stop letting her publish articles, DT.
Engie – the Trousdale/USC station is expected to open in early 2012, NOT 2015. 1st phase is from 7th street to Culver City to open in 2012, 2nd phase is from Culver City to Santa Monica, which will open in 2015.
The station is currently set to open with the Expo Line Phase I in 2012, not 2015—the rest of the Expo Line, Phase II, is set to open in 2015.

Student veterans shared their experiences Tuesday during a symposium, providing a public voice for the usually quiet population of about 530 student veterans at USC.
Valor · Valvincent Reyes, professor of military social work, spoke about his service in the military and resources available to veteran students. The university has approximately 530 undergraduate and graduate student veterans. - Ani Kolangian | Daily Trojan
 
Veterans from all five branches of the U.S. Armed Forces discussed what they had learned from their time in the military and in their experience as veterans at USC.
Aviana Brown, an army veteran and graduate student studying social work, said serving in the military truly changed her as a person.
“I joined young and I think I grew from the whole process,” Brown said. “I had to spread my wings really fast.”
All five veterans on the panel said they gained something positive from their military experience, including leadership skills, responsibility, respect and thirst for knowledge.
Jeff Ting, a marine veteran and junior majoring in accounting, said the military gave him a sense of direction and determination.
“You don’t let people tell you what you can and can’t do,” Ting said. “No one cares about you more than you do and you have to go for what you want. I got direction. I realized what I wanted to do in life and what I didn’t want to do, which is why I came to USC.”
Despite the  benefits of the military there was a lot of anxiety in coping with leaving their homes and being deployed to foreign countries.
“My buddies and I would talk about when we were going home, which was problematic, so the plan was to forget about home,” said Lerri Deguzman, a marine veteran and junior majoring in business administration. “Forget about your family or when you’re going to go back. I had to isolate myself and forget there was a world outside of Iraq because it was too depressing.”
Deguzman said, however, he wishes the university would do more to accommodate to the needs of veteran students.
“Veterans are lost,” Deguzman said. “We’re trying to find a way to pay for school, find a place to live. At first there weren’t a lot of resources, but the people at USC were willing to do whatever they could to help you out.”
Deguzman said there have been positive changes in the university since he arrived in 2009.
“The resources of this school are meant for the normal student body, so the playing field isn’t completely level,” Deguzman said. “But I’ve started to see an improvement, at least this semester. They just opened up the Office for Transfers and Veterans Students which has been great.”
Jay Kellogg, a navy veteran and a senior majoring in sociology,  said despite some of the obstacles he has encountered at USC, the overall experience has been worthwhile.
“Even though there are some students that aren’t interested, I think people do care and are very appreciative,” Kellogg said. “I’ve had a great experience at USC. I think the faculty is awesome.”

The postseason hardware looks like it might find its way into the hands of USC sophomore wide receiver Robert Woods, who has put up some impressive numbers in just his second season with the Trojans’ program.
The second-year wideout has been named a semifinalist for the Biletnikoff Award, given annually to the college football’s best receiver.
Woods ranks seventh in total receiving yards (1,126), fourth in total catches (92) and ties for fourth in touchdowns (11). All of those marks put him first in the Pac-12.
Woods is on pace to pass former USC receiver Keyshawn Johnson’s mark for the Pac-12 and USC record for most receptions in a season at 102.
Woods was named one of 10 semifinalists Monday, joining fellow Pac-12 sophomore, California’s Kennan Allen along with Baylor’s Kendall Wright, Oklahoma State’s Justin Blackmon, Western Michigan’s Jordan White, Oklahoma’s Ryan Broyles, Clemson’s Sammy Watkins, Houston’s Patrick Edwards, Notre Dame’s Michael Floyd and Illinois’ A.J. Jenkins.
Before last Saturday’s game against Washington, in which Woods caught a mere two passes for five yards, Woods seldom had a poor week, his worst outing being the five-catch, 36-yard performance against California at AT&T Park in San Francisco on Oct. 13.
This season Woods has already broken USC records for receptions in a game — 17 against Minnesota during the team’s season opener on Sept. 3 — and yards in a game — 255 during an Oct. 1 game against Arizona.
Since the award’s inception in 1994, no USC wide receiver has ever won the award.
The finalists of the Biletnikoff Award will be announced Nov. 21, and the winner will be announced on The Home Depot College Football Awards live on Dec. 8, at 6 p.m. on ESPN.
 
Correction: A previous version of this article stated Robert Woods recorded seven receptions against Minnesota. He actually had 17.
Errata note please, Wood’s record was 17 catches, right?

When USC and Oregon meet on the football field Saturday night in Eugene, Ore., there will be more on the line than the Ducks’ recently reinvigorated BCS title hopes.
The future of the Pac-12 conference is at stake.
The Trojans and Ducks have combined to win the last nine conference titles and Oregon is in prime position to extend that run this year. The Ducks have lost only one Pac-12 game under offensive mastermind coach Chip Kelly. The Trojans have looked as good in their last five games as they had in 2008 and seem ready to reemerge on the national stage.
Saturday’s game affords USC the opportunity to prove that while it can’t compete in the 2011 conference championship game as part of a postseason ban, the Trojans are prepared to challenge Oregon’s hegemony at the top of the Pac-12. If there’s a team that can do it, it’s USC.
As well as Stanford has played the last two seasons, the departure of previous coach Jim Harbaugh to the NFL last season was a crushing blow to the program.
Harbaugh has shown he can flat out coach with the San Francisco 49ers and it was his recruiting more than quarterback Andrew Luck’s passing that turned the Cardinal around from a perennial bottom feeder into a top-10 team.
The Trojans used to rule West Coast football under then-coach Pete Carroll, so much so that the old Pac-10 was often referred to as “USC and the nine dwarves.”
A few down seasons, a coaching change and NCAA sanctions later for USC, it’s now Oregon that is the preeminent football program in the Pacific Time Zone.
For all their recent shared success, the programs couldn’t be more dissimilar.
It’s one of college football’s most tradition-steeped programs against new Nike money. It’s the pro-style, made for the NFL offense against the innovative, flavor-of-the-month spread attack. It’s classic cardinal and gold against an ever-changing, neon array of green and yellow.
In their most recent two meetings, the Trojans — like all of the Ducks’ non-SEC opponents over the last two years — have struggled to keep up with Oregon’s speed and trickery on offense. The Ducks have piled up a combined 1,212 yards of total offense — including 702 yards rushing — in the teams’ last two contests.
This season, USC’s defense is much improved. The Trojans have given up 17 points or less in four of their last five games and are ranked eighth in the nation in rushing defense.
The battle for Pac-12 supremacy has picked up off the field too, as the Ducks have used their recent success to recruit some of California’s most talented high school players. Oregon’s biggest recruiting coup came early last February, when Los Angeles native De’Anthony Thomas — the No. 5 recruit in the class of 2011 according to Rivals.com — chose to play for the Ducks, reversing an earlier commitment to USC.
The fact that Thomas played prep ball at Crenshaw High School — less than 10 minutes from USC’s campus —  and that he received his “Black Mamba” nickname from family friend and ardent USC supporter Snoop Dogg made the spurning even more difficult for Trojan fans.
Thomas has flourished as freshman tailback in Kelly’s spread offense, leading the Ducks in receiving and kick returns while piling up 13 total touchdowns and averaging eight yards per carry.
The fact that Thomas’ decision came down to USC or Oregon is a testament to how bright the future looks for both teams.
Oregon’s ability to plug in players at quarterback (freshman Bryan Bennett has filled in admirably for starter Darron Thomas at times this season) and running back (De’Anthony Thomas splits time with Heisman Trophy hopeful LaMichael James and speedy Kenjon Barner) without missing a beat makes the Ducks less reliant on winning every recruiting battle.
In recent weeks, it’s become clear that USC’s biggest asset is its youth.
In the Trojans’ 40-17 win over Washington, only two of USC’s 22 starters (fullback Rhett Ellison and defensive tackle Christian Tupou) are redshirt seniors. Some of its biggest stars — leading receivers Robert Woods and Marqise Lee, top tacklers Dion Bailey and Hayes Pullard and shut-down cornerback Nickell Robey — are freshmen and sophomores.
If the Trojans’ junior signal caller Matt Barkley does in fact decide to return for his senior season next year, the Trojans and Ducks will likely both start 2012 ranked in the nation’s top 10. Next year’s game in Los Angeles could potentially mean a lot more for both teams, especially for the Trojans.
Consider this Saturday’s game, then, a national platform for USC and Oregon to stake their claim as kings of the Pac-12 going forward.
With another blowout victory, Oregon would remove any doubt regarding their title of best in the west.
If USC can pull of what would be a shocking upset, they will serve the whole country a notice: Trojan football has returned.
As far as statement games go, they don’t get much bigger than this.

Do not even compare this team to the 2008 team; the mere though of that comparison is absolutely absurd.  The 2008 team deserved to be in the national championship game and, from what I saw in the awful championship game that actually took place between Tim Tebow and Bob Stoops, USC would have beat either team.
The current team, while better than the past couple of years, is nowhere near that level of competitiveness or skill.  I love the Trojans and I’m going to be rooting for them with all of my heart on Saturday, but to say that “the Trojans have looked as good in their last five games as they had in 2008” just detracts from your credibility as a writer.
Slow down there Jonathan. 
USC in 2011 so far has really struggled at home against a woeful Minnesota team (that went on to lose to North Dakota State) at home in the Colesium, lost to an average Arizona State team in Tempe and lost at home when all hands were on deck against Stanford. 
USC is much improved over last year, yes, at 8-2 the Trojans are a real threat to come up into Eugene and beat Oregon. However, I’m not so sure this is a “statement game” like you’re calling it. Sure, it would be a nice win but USC is going to really be feeling it’s scholarship losses these next few years and that has to be recognized.
Oregon isn’t exactly as new to the national stage as you lead on. Nobody up north is comparing USC and Oregon’s tradition. Not at all. However, Oregon’s not exactly been a doormat for the past 30 years. There have been other BCS games, Rose Bowl, Cotton Bowl, some lofty rankings and some great NFL products coming out of Eugene. Albeit zero Heisman trophy winners, zero national titles… ya, Duck fans get it. Just be careful with insinuating Oregon recently showed up to the party. 
Hopefully Oregon and USC play a great game Saturday night, and both teams come out injury free. GO DUCKS!

The USC defense, an oft-maligned group, was searching for answers coming into this season, and even midway through the year, more questions kept arising.
Tough front · Junior defensive end Wes Horton and USC have allowed less than 20 and fewer than 270 total yards in three of their last four games. - Brandon Hui | Daily Trojan
 
On Oct. 1, the Trojans surrendered a total of 425 yards and 41 points, while allowing Arizona to convert 37 first downs — a program first. It also marked the first time in school history the Trojans had allowed opposing teams to score more than 40 points in consecutive games.
Rewind back to Arizona State on Sept. 24, they similarly surrendered 43 points.
But in recent weeks, many of the questions have been answered and the consistency the players have been searching for under defensive guru assistant head coach Monte Kiffin and defensive coordinator Ed Orgeron is finally starting to show. In three of USC’s last four matchups, it has allowed fewer than 20 points and fewer than 270 yards of total offense.
“They feel good about themselves and a lot of it is confidence,” Kiffin said following Tuesday’s practice. “I think we’ve played pretty well. We’re getting more confident in what we’re doing.”
Part of that can be attributed to USC’s rush defense, which ranks eighth in the nation, allowing 100 yards per contest — a big improvement from a year ago when it gave up 140.5 rushing yards per game. Throughout the last five games, however, opposing teams have averaged just 88 rushing yards.
And in three of its last five games against California, Notre Dame and Washington, USC has held its opponents to less than 50 rushing yards.
The Trojans’ linebackers have played a big role in that. For much of the season, USC has started redshirt freshmen Dion Bailey and Hayes Pullard and senior linebacker Chris Galippo.
They rank No. 1 and No. 2 in tackles on the team, respectively. In the last two games, however, the Trojans have used a pair of true freshmen in Tre Madden and Lamar Dawson. And the coaching staff has taken notice of their progress throughout the season.
“They’ve really developed,” Kiffin said. “We have a lot of really good young linebackers. The more experience they get, they’ll get better. They’re good athletes and they can make plays.”
Though USC’s youth and inexperience might have showed in the beginning of the season, now that the team is in week 11, Kiffin believes his young core of linebackers will only improve in the remainder of this season and into the future.
“We’re still a fairly young defense, but now we’re better,” Kiffin said. “They’re playing faster now and if they know what they’re doing, they’ll continue to [get better].”
Sophomore cornerback Nickell Robey echoed similar sentiments.
“We have a lot of young [talent],” he said. “They just have to continue to do the things that they’re doing and we’ll be fine. They work hard every day in practice and get better throughout games and that’s what we want to see.”
The secondary has also benefitted from the play of the its front seven. Against Washington, USC recorded a season-high seven sacks, constantly putting pressure on quarterbacks Keith Price and Nick Montana. The Trojans’ pass defense has allowed opposing quarterbacks to pass for 250 yards or less in three of its last four contests.
“It makes our job easier,” Robey said after the Washington game. “It allows [us] to see better and cover better because we’re getting so much pressure. It’s a great thing to have that pass rush.”
The players feel strongly that the defense is clicking at the right time and that the unit has made significant strides from the beginning of the season.
“We’re in a rhythm right now,” Robey said. “It feels so good. It’s so good when you see things come together and I feel things have really come together for us as a defense. It’s like we’re a whole different team.”

No. 18 USC, having won five of its last six contests, began preparations Tuesday for arguably its most anticipated game of the season: a matchup against No. 4 Oregon at Autzen Stadium in Eugene, Ore., on Saturday night.
Speed kills · Then-No. 1 Oregon, led by quarterback Darron Thomas and running back LaMichael James, totaled 53 points in a three-touchdown victory over USC last season at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum. - Daily Trojan file photo
The challenge will be steep — if recent results serve as any indication.
Though the Trojans hold the upper hand in the all-time series between the two programs, 37-18-2, the Ducks have won the last two matchups, compiling a total of 100 points, including 53 points last season at the Coliseum. And over the last four seasons, they have upended the Trojans three times.
To make matters even more difficult for USC, Oregon’s most recent victory this season came against then-No. 4 Stanford by 23 points in Palo Alto, Calif.
“As I said the other day, [they’re] probably the hottest team in the country especially if you play them at their place,” USC coach Lane Kiffin said of the Ducks, who have won nine straight games since a 40-27 loss to No. 1 LSU on Sept. 3. “For the most part since the opener, really nobody has slowed them down, for an entire game. They do it at times.”
In turn, heading into the game, the Trojans are currently 16.5-point underdogs against Oregon, which ranks third nationally in points per game with 46.7 and has suddenly vaulted itself into the race for a spot in the BCS national championship game.
And unlike the Trojans’ last nationally televised, primetime showdown, the contest will take place outside the friendly confines of South Los Angeles.
“I don’t know if anyone can tell you that there is a better team when they play at home than Oregon,” Kiffin said. “It’s an awesome challenge for us and we’re excited to go up there.”
USC hasn’t won at Autzen Stadium since 2005, losing in 2007 by a score of 24-17 and in 2009, 47-20.

Last week’s 40-17 victory against Washington at home marked the second career start for freshman linebacker Lamar Dawson. He started over senior linebacker Chris Galippo, who had started the first eight games of this season.
“I’m getting more comfortable with the defense and knowing my responsibilities,” Dawson said. “I did all right but there is always room for improvements.”
Kiffin was pleased with Dawson’s performance, as the Kentucky native finished with three tackles and one sack against the Huskies last Saturday.
“Lamar looked good and played a really good game for us,” Kiffin said. “He’s going to be a great player and he’s starting to show it now.”
Though sporting a number of freshman in its starting lineup, the defense, which surrendered just two touchdowns against Washington, has made noticeable strides since last season.
“I think we have improved throughout the year,” junior safety T.J. McDonald said. “We’re a much better tackling team than we were last year and we’re a lot more physical.”
McDonald said the defense needs to focus on not giving the opposing team second chances.

The Trojans are excited about the possibility of going into a hostile environment Saturday.
“They’re going to be loud, it’s going to be exciting and a good atmosphere,” McDonald said.  “We’re going to go in there, give a good fight and hopefully get the win.”
Most importantly, the Trojans plan to remain calm, cool and collected against the Ducks.
“We can’t get out of whack because it is a big time game like this,” junior quarterback Matt Barkley said. “We can’t let the elements get to us.”
Barkley said the team has matured from the beginning of the season, and he is not worried about nerves getting the best of them.
Sophomore wide receiver Robert Woods plans to bounce back after only having five receptions against the Huskies.
“Receptions were low, but we got the win,” Woods said.  “Sometimes you’re not getting the ball as much but you have to contribute in other places.”
Woods, along with other receivers, was influential in blocking the Washington defense.
USC plans to go back to basics and focus on technique against Oregon.
“I need to step things up again,” said Woods, who already boasts 11 touchdown receptions this season. “Each week I get better and I need to continue so we can go out and beat Oregon. Oregon is a great team offensively and defensively. We just need to play well. If they score a lot of points then we need to match that to stay with them.”
Senior defensive tackles Da’John Harris and Christian Tupou and sophomore safety Demetrius Wright did not participate during Tuesday’s workouts.
Junior safety Jawanza Starling, Woods and redshirt junior offensive tackle Matt Kalil were limited. Kiffin expects to have everyone healthy by Saturday as Oregon awaits.
“Hopefully we get them all back,” Kiffin said. “We’ll need them all for a very challenging week.”
Woods believes that a signature performance against the Ducks will prove that the Trojans are a lethal program.
“This is our biggest game so far,” Woods said. “It is our opportunity once again to prove what ’SC is and who we are on the national level.”

With Thanksgiving just around the corner, it’s time we start moving beyond the familiar images of gravy-slathered turkey and rich pumpkin pies — Black Friday is where the excitement’s really at.
Recent advertisements showcase next week’s Black Friday sales as especially impressive, particularly in the realm of video games and game consoles.
But it’s not always easy trying to decide which stores to shop at.
For college students, money and time can be tight. But Black Friday offers a nice alternative to wasting hard-earned savings.
It’s been a long semester after all, so why not reward yourself with some cheap, fun video games? Why not save $30 on that one game you’ve always wanted to get your sibling for Christmas?
Here is a Black Friday shopper’s guide to score the best deals on video games and game-related products:
If you are looking to browse a large selection of cheap games, go to Best Buy:
Best Buy’s unusually low prices and diverse selection of video games make it a definite go-to center for gamers hoping to expand their game collections without spending too much extra money. The popular retailer offers an impressive variety of $7.99, $14.99 and $24.99 games, the lowest deals so far in comparison to those advertised by competing chain stores. Best Buy’s $7.99 sale beats Target’s $15 sale and Wal-Mart’s $10 sale.
With such a cheap price, one might expect low quality games. For less than $16, however, you can purchase the popular first- and third-person shooter games, Call of Duty: World at War and Gears of War: Triple Pack. Both are steals if you’re trying to expand your Xbox 360 collection.
If you’re more of a casual gamer or not into first-person shooters, Best Buy also offers Jeopardy for the Wii at a similar price. The head-scratching trivia game is a replica of its game show counterpart and makes for a fun family-oriented Christmas present.
If you are looking to save big on high-quality titles, go to Wal-Mart:
Though Best Buy has a wide assortment of cheap games, Wal-Mart wins in terms of offering the most popular, high-quality titles at the lowest prices. These include newer hits like Batman: Arkham City, the October-released sequel to 2009’s critically acclaimed Batman: Arkham Asylum, as well as the November-released Uncharted 3: Drake’s Deception, the third installment in the action-adventure, third-person shooter series. All these games have a retail value of $60, but Wal-Mart is tagging them at just $28 a piece, $2 lower than Best Buy’s $30 sale and $7 lower than Target’s $37 sale.
Wal-Mart is also one of the only retailers to advertise a $59.96 price tag for the highly anticipated Legend of Zelda: Skyward Sword gold Wii remote bundle package. The special edition game has already sold out in preorders online at its $10-more retail price of $70. Saving $10 might not seem like much, but it’s a good opportunity to save a few bucks on this super popular Wii game, especially since preorders have already begun selling out.
If you are looking for solid console deals, go to Target:
Target is not quite on par with Best Buy and Wal-Mart this year with some higher-end prices and a less-impressive game selection, but the retailer still plans to offer some decent deals on game consoles and packages that shouldn’t be passed up.
If you didn’t get around to buying an Xbox 360, Target is selling the same console for just $139.99 each, the cheapest deal so far for the bare-bones version of the 4GB game console. It’s a whole 10 bucks cheaper than those to be sold at GameStop.
Target will also be selling a Nintendo 3DS bundle with the recently released Super Mario 3-D Land for a total of just $179.99. Best Buy has also announced plans to sell this package along with another bundle that replaces Super Mario 3-D Land with the Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time 3-D. Though the 3DS has sold relatively poorly this year and even dropped its price from $250 to $170 in August to increase sales, these next few months Nintendo is promising a ton of high-quality, original games for the 3DS, making now the best time to join the pack and purchase one.

The latest volume of hip-hop poetry from poet Quincy Smith seeks to depict love, truth, knowledge and inspiration, or what Smith calls “the elements.” Though Smith’s poems consistently deal with, controversial, political and social issues, his creative methods capriciously fluctuate between the inaccurate and the realistic. At certain times, his disjointed style doesn’t seem to be able to handle such profound content; at others, he nails it perfectly.
Released online Aug. 24, The Elements: Love, Truth, Knowledge, and Inspiration features poems Smith has written over the course of 10 years, ranging from when he was a college student studying creative writing to when he first began work on his upcoming documentary film The Element: The Gift, which showcases spoken word. Perhaps because the poems were written over such an extended period of time, some poems excel and others fail, demonstrating Smith’s growth as a poet. Nevertheless, when style is ignored, Smith’s work radiates raw truth.
“I got the concept for The Elements from current events,” Smith said. “These are core ingredients that come from societal issues. In these hard times, a lot of people need hope and faith. I’m always telling people to strive for your goals and reach high.”
That’s what Smith did when he graduated in 1999 with a bachelor’s degree in English; Smith was the only African-American in the English Department at Cal State Long Beach.
“That was a challenge,” Smith said. “It was hard coming from a background where I spoke Ebonics. My professors saw talent but told me to polish it up, so I had to work on that, and learn to speak properly.”
During his time at Cal State Long Beach, Smith turned every effort in to his craft. He learned from the work of poetic legends, studied with USC professor Steven Cooper, took trips to overcome writer’s block, turned to nature and God for inspiration, performed at open mic nights and experimented by putting music in his poetry.
“When I was at Cal State [Long Beach], I started to develop my craft,” Smith said. “Once I wrote my first poem, I was doing blues and jazz. When I got ideas and concepts, I had that passion to develop the skill.”
Twelve years later, the result of all of this work is a collection of 44 poems that are moving at times and confusing at others. In his love poems, this gap is the most notable.
In “To Love, Cherish, and Honor,” Smith seeks pure love among earth’s carnal temptations: I dwell in place away from temptations. Beyond the clouds, in a zone where love and paradise embrace and exceed expectations on earth.
In “Every Day Is a Valentine,” Smith describes A couples’ burning itch / to get filthy rich, retire early in mid-thirties, / Own real estate like Monopoly, suggesting child-like dreams of getting rich don’t compare to the realistic, mature nature of true love.
Then Smith flips the switch and loses poignant and clever lyrics for grittier, more explicit ones. In “Remember Me,” Smith writes, Girl, what size are your hips? Twenty, twenty-five, a proper size nine; / Because I see it’s banging clearly, like the waves in the ocean.
The problem lies not in the content — after all, Smith seeks to write truth — but in the broken metaphors. Do ocean waves really bang like a woman’s hips?
“[Coming] from someone who had an experience in a relationship,” Smith said. “It’s just picking the right words that reflect how you feel in a particular time. That’s where being creative comes in. It brings [the poetry] to life, explaining how someone felt or how someone could feel in those circumstances.”
In some instances Smith executes this perfectly — in his emotionally charged poems, such as “Twenty-five to Life” and “Watch Me Fly in Due Time” — but at other times, his lines produce an unwanted effect.
I’m twisted, kicking my feet, trying not to lose my composure, writes Smith later in the same poem. I wanna be lethal like a grizzly bear plotting just to hold you.
Do grizzly bears hold people or maul them to death? Sometimes it’s difficult to see the connection between Smith’s words and the image he’s trying to describe.
Nonetheless, Smith’s collection of poems contains a wide range of emotions and images.
“President Obama” responds to god-like portrayals of Obama and warns audiences that No man is above God.
“Haiku Poem,” a piece made up of three haikus strung together, is so well crafted it doesn’t seem like Smith struggles with syllabic structure at all.
In “Black Queen,” Smith describes the beauty of black women and apologizes for the ignorance that has disabled many within society. He writes of felons within prison walls, the modern slavery of the black community, the colorful barbecues of California summers.
“Poetry is something that is profound and uplifting,” Smith said. “It’s just a way of life. Everything we do is poetry.”
Smith hopes the film rendition of The Elements will be released in spring 2012.

Playwright and producer Ralph Tropf’s latest play The Animal Within is a farce to be reckoned with. The romp features sexy plotlines, quirky characters and a beach house in which several sexual misadventures occur. The production certainly has its flaws regarding writing and certain plot twists; nonetheless, it maintains an entertaining air of energy and spark.

The play takes place in a beachside California mansion, in which married couple Robert (Nathan Bouldin) and Sylvia Argus (Carrie Madsen) reside. Of course, their vanilla lifestyle is shaken up when Sylvia decides to hire young, sexually curious live-in housekeeper Melody (Howland Wilson) against Robert’s wishes. Melody’s carefree presence reawakens Sylvia’s suppressed attraction to women and begins the 90-minute farce, complete with slamming doors, misunderstandings and sexual deviance among all three parties.
These comical misadventures come to life under the guidance of director Lynn Stevenson, who consistently excites audiences with wise directorial choices. Stevenson cleverly stages the play in such a way that there is always a character coming or going, creating suspense and dramatic tension. Moreover, Stevenson makes expert use of her minimalist, three-person cast, keeping the audience entertained with the cast’s dynamics.
Stevenson also takes advantage of the set. Having three doors for entrances and exits lends itself perfectly to the satirical nature of this play — slamming doors being the trademark of any good farce.
On that humorous note, Stevenson makes many other classical comedic stops.  For instance, Robert nearly catches Sylvia and Melody in a compromising situation three times in a row and is still oblivious. Each time Robert enters, Sylvia and Melody are engaged in displays of affection and must quickly separate and act aloof as he enters the room. This is only one of many examples of sharp comedy in the play.
As evidenced from the strength of the dynamics and the clever use of comedy, the script is clearly in deft hands with Tropf.
The play starts off strong, immediately introducing the conflict and operating on a solid premise created by Tropf; a woman begins having an affair with her sexy live-in housekeeper; and her husband soon follows suit.
The first half of the play is consistent in its sexy, fun and outright hilarious tone, delivering a steady stream of jokes balanced with a captivating conflict. Airy naïve Melody is the perfect foil to the uptight Sylvia who is trapped in a stale marriage.
This initial strength in the play’s tone, however, does not extend throughout the show, as there are some major missteps in the latter half of the piece.
The second half makes the characters seem one-dimensional as Robert and Sylvia argue. As a result, the ending of the play also takes a turn for the worst when the characters succumb to complete chaos.
Yet these blunders can be forgiven because of the play’s initial strength and the charismatic, likeable cast.
Wilson, for example, skillfully portrays the impulsive, dim-witted yet likable Melody, whose lack of real world knowledge could have easily come off as irksome and unlikable in the hands of a less skilled actress. In fact, the most interesting scenes involved or revolved around Wilson and her sexuality.
Madsen also creates a vivid character, struggling with outward appearances and inner secrets. Madsen strikes a balance between the strong, domineering aspect of her character and the character’s inner wild side.
Bouldin is the weaker link in an all-around strong cast, as his character comes off as either too wimpy or too crazy to be likable. Most problems with Bouldin’s character Robert, however, likely come from the erratic script.  Robert starts off a spineless man and ends up a crazed one.
Despite this minor flaw, the cast enhances the humor and strength of the script.
The Animal Within, nevertheless, provides steady laughs throughout. Its main fault is the chaos that ensues toward the end, which is preferable, however, to a play that bores. The nimble direction, combined with funny writing and a standout cast, make this farce worth seeing.
The Animal Within runs through Dec. 18 at the Elephant Theatre.

“No Church in the Wild” coldly set the bombastic tone for Jay-Z and Kanye West’s Watch the Throne. The “Intro” to Lil Wayne’s Tha Carter IV reminded everyone just how unhinged the Louisiana native still was despite his cleaner post-jail image. Even J. Cole’s “Intro” on Cole World: A Sideline Story gave the sense that we were about to hear the deepest recesses in the mind of one of hip-hop’s brightest young stars.
Opening tracks, especially those on hip-hop albums, should give a sense of where the artist is stylistically and offer the ultimate sneak peak at the rest of the album. The biggest and brightest in hip-hop have certainly not forgotten.
So when the Noah “40” Shebib-produced piano keys start tingling on “Over My Dead Body,” the opening track to Drake’s newest effort Take Care, and insecurity and arrogance starts pouring out all at the same time, it’s reassuring to know Aubrey “Drake” Graham hasn’t left his comfort zone — one he has mastered all by himself and has now surely turned into another hit album.
The Toronto-born, Young Money, Cash Money-bred Drake has never been afraid to spill his feelings, positive or negative, on a track, and Take Care is full of the 25-year-old’s recollections and crooning — never more apparent than on the promotional single that turned into an album mainstay, “Marvin’s Room.”
Taking the time out of his champagne lifestyle to call a former girlfriend, Drake admits The woman that I would try is happy with a good guy / But I’ve been drinking so much that I’mma call her anyway. What other rapper has the gall to, first, admit that he’s not the best for someone, and, then, drunk dial the one that got away? Rick Ross is certainly not on the other end of that line.
“Take Care,” downbeat dance floor music that has hit single written all over it, serves as an effective follow-up collaboration to “What’s My Name?” between the alleged dating duo of Rihanna and Drake. It’s about meeting someone at just the wrong time in life; while Rihanna belts out If you let me, here’s what I’ll do / I’ll take care of you, Drake hits deep with lines such as, My only wish is I die real / Cause that truth hurts and those lies heal.
Lex Luger takes a break from giving church bells the trap music treatment for Waka Flocka Flame and Rick Ross to provide Take Care with “Cameras (Good Ones Go),” an unusual track about the facade photographs create of Drake’s public persona.
All of the emotion and deeply rooted passion is not to intimate Drake didn’t hit some of those essential pompous keynotes every rap album needs. Though many of the classically crooning Drake cuts on Take Care run 40’s name as the top-billed producer, other producers provided the beats for some of the album’s more up-tempo and enjoyable flows.
Long-time Drake collaborator Boi-1da’s first appearance on Take Care and the album’s first official single, “Headlines,” is pervasive, radio-friendly pop rap that has already proven its surprising staying power.
Producer Just Blaze (all three Jay-Z Blueprint albums) offers the chance for Ross to provide a few classic grunts and his Teflon-don flow on “Lord Knows,” but it’s here that Drake shines brightest as a pure rapper, delivery on fire, well out-strutting the hottest name in hip-hop. But it’s incongruity.
Drake is not interested in being Ross, Lil Wayne or Busta Rhymes. Whereas teaming with Wayne and Nicki Minaj has made Drake a household name, his collaborations with Wayne (“Hell Yeah F–kin’ Right”) and Minaj (“Make Me Proud”) this time are relatively low points on the album, as the Young Money Cash Money team just doesn’t seem on the same level as  Drake.
The collaboration that does stand out here, then, is an unspoken one. Stevie Wonder provides a harmonica solo at the end of what must be the crowning achievement in the pathos of the 80-minute Take Care in “Doing it Wrong.”
We live in a generation of not being in love, and not being together / But we sure make it feel like we’re together, Drake croons.

Article offensive to transgenders
My name is Dylan and I am a transgender sophomore at USC. I have only recently started my transition, and I have attended USC throughout my entire coming out process thus far. Though I have seen trans rights discussed in the Daily Trojan before (re: the counterpoint piece on the necessity of gender-neutral bathrooms), I have never been as offended, hurt and shocked by the content of the Daily Trojan as I was by the article written by Engie Salama. Salama comments on the perceived necessity of the laws in place in California that help protect transgender people, and she urges people to be more compassionate and understanding toward those who might not be comfortable around trans people.
Salama is privileged that she has not been exposed to the horrific amount of bullying, violence and harassment faced by transgender individuals. She is lucky to not be affected by the disturbingly high rates of suicide and homelessness in the transgender community.
According to Mara Keisling, executive director of the National Center for Transgender Equality, “[the center’s] study participants reported attempting suicide at a rate more than 25 times the national average.” Forty-one percent of all respondents reported they had attempted suicide, compared with a national estimated average of 1.6 percent.
That means transgender individuals are over 25 times more likely to attempt suicide than their cisgender counterparts. But “surely there are larger problems to worry about,” Salama said. The article goes on to critique the California laws that allow transgender individuals to change the gender markers on their legal identification. Salama argues that the ease with which transgender people can change their gender markers on their passports is problematic and unnecessary. Having an ID that accurately reflects a trans person’s gender is not a petty matter of semantics — it is a matter of safety.
When someone’s ID does not match their presentation, it puts them in very real danger, especially when dealing with police, bouncers at clubs and other such security personnel. Even the simple act of providing ID with a credit card purchase can be a scary and unsafe situation for a transgender individual whose identification does not align with their identity or presentation.
The rights of individuals to hold jobs and interact in the public and private spheres without being discriminated against based on their gender identity or expression are not small and trivial problems. They are very real rights that allow very real people to lead (hopefully) happy, safe lives. Gender identity is not a choice, nor are the horrific injustices faced by trans people “narrow, personal issues.”
Hopefully, Salama will reach out to me and other trans members of the Trojan Family to learn about our experiences and learn some compassion instead of writing articles about how our lives don’t matter.

Respect for others must never be compromised
While I understand the article is an opinion piece, it was written with an incredible amount of disrespect toward the transgender community.
As someone who fully supports LGBT rights and has friends who are transgender, I was extremely dissappointed in the fact that this article was published. It is stated that “We should instead be more accepting of the people who aren’t as comfortable with working with people who identify as transgender.” If we should do that, then should we also be accepting of the people who aren’t comfortable working with blacks? Or gays? Or Muslims?
I understand the importance of free-thinking and self-expression. Compromising the respect of others should, however, never be a part of that free-thinking and self-expression, particularly in a college newspaper.
Please don’t encourage ignorance. Fight it.

Acceptance necessary in social realm
I found it difficult to gather my thoughts after reading the shockingly backwards opinion piece published Nov. 14 in the Daily Trojan by Engie Salama.
It would appear that this freshman still has a lot to learn. My stomach churned as I read, “The truth is, many people might not be comfortable accepting others for their personal decisions.”
Do some research next time and you’ll find out that science is not backing you on this. You are running against a truckload of biological evidence in the areas of genetics, neuroscience and developmental biology. Gender identity is not a decision. Sexual orientation is not a decision.
She asks, “Is it really necessary to create a law to expedite that transition?” Was it necessary to end discrimination against women? What about African-Americans? Where do you draw the line? Who deserves explicit protection by law because I would love to know.
But that’s not where the madness stopped. She continues, “We should instead be more accepting of the people who aren’t as comfortable with working with people who identify as transgender.”
Should we also be accepting of people who aren’t comfortable working with gay people? With African-Americans? With Asians? It’s the same thing — it’s an inborn trait that can’t be changed. Her assertion that gender is a choice is scientifically false. If you believe otherwise, you’re up against the American Medical Association, American Psychiatric Association and American Psychological Association.

Government should protect citizens’ rights
I was distressed by the author’s implication that a state government must pay more attention to the people uncomfortable with any identities when making decisions about which class of people to protect. The author believes “We should instead be more accepting of the people who aren’t as comfortable with working with people who identify as transgender.”  This type of argument, however, leads to a lack of protection for any vulnerable and disempowered people.
If we were to extend this type of thinking to other groups that could willfully discriminate, then women, the elderly, people with disabilities, legal residents and religious minorities would be at risk for losing their jobs simply because of who they are or what they believe because people are uncomfortable  with their identities.  If the author was denied housing, job or education  because of the author’s expressed identities, would she accept the government telling her “We’re sorry but people are uncomfortable around you, and you need to live with those consequences of your own identity since some of these are your choice to express.”
If the author believes gender expression is a choice, I would challenge her to identify when she made her choice to express her identity in public ways and why she would continue to express it as a woman knowing that women are also the target for gender discrimination.
The author believes it is not transgender status that makes people the target of discrimination, but socioeconomic status or education.  Though these factors do impact their target status, we cannot discount the fear transgender people feel when trying to go to school, nor are they immune to the attitudes from their teachers and administrators who blame them for being transgender and calling attention to themselves.  So while the author believes there are more pressing issues for the government such as fixing broken lights, I believe the government’s actions are upholding their highest responsibility — protecting its citizens from each other regardless of their identities.

I believe that Ms. Salama’s comments were misconstrued. I do not think her intent was to offend anyone but perhaps her choice of words may have created a negative perspective on her argument. First of all, let’s face the fact that none of us are truly experiencing any protection by the laws of our beloved homeland(USA). Neither Ms. Salama nor this author is marginalizing the rights of transgenders or anyone else for that matter. I believe that she wanted to present all sides of the prism of understanding and tolerance. Black folks and Jews were treated in the same manner right here in our beloved homeland and in some instances are still being looked upon with intolerance and disdain by the ignorant. Every group has its day to be ridiculed, scorned and ostracized. The key is to remain true to yourself. Despite the many challenges that anyone may encounter(Blacks, Transgenders, Jews, Muslims et al), dignity, integrity and confidence(gained through various networks of like minded individuals) will enable anyone of us to conquer the threat of ignorance. Tolerance is a two way bridge. When we encounter this type of attitude it is our responsibility to educate, educate, educate! When we are met with ignorance we don’t have to run headlong into it but we can make the decision to circumvent or rise above it. Life’s challenges helps us to stretch our potential. If transgenders are having problems renting from the ignorant, then this should push for more collaboration to pool resources and purchase property that can be rented without bias to those in need. Remember where there is a will there is a way and it takes two to tango. We have to all realize that our toes will be stepped upon when circulating within the domain of the ignorant. Imagine how Muslims feel when their beliefs and their Deity are attacked by the ignorant? Imagine what it’s like when you are denied a promotion on a job because of your beliefs as a Muslim? Imagine what is like when you go to the bank to deposit a check and you are taken into a room to be interrogated then locked up in jail for a mistake that the bank made. I can go on and on with the myriad travesties surrounding our human condition but would it change anything externally? In closing, I would like you to ponder this thought: Nothing changes (on the outside) until one changes what’s inside one’s self. Peace.
Thank you Dylan and everyone for these wonderful letters. For those who are angry about the initial article, if you want to feel like doing something concrete to counteract that kind of ignorance, please donate to the Transgender Law Center. My trans partner and I, two Trojan alums, have a fundraising page: http://www.firstgiving.com/fundraiser/olgaandannika/remember-respond-renew-2011.
We do not need new laws for the transgendered.  We already have laws against violence (murder, assault, mayhem, rape, fighting words). Why are these laws insufficient to protect the transgenedered?
Ignorance and Intolerance go both ways. You cannot jail or sue the intolerant without showing yourself intolerant.  To think that you are enlightened is to deny your own ignorance.
No one here is asserting that the intolerant or ignorant should be jailed, or that violence should be used against those who are intolerant of trans people.  The letters here are simply making the point that Miss Salama’s article was transphobic and that she should be educated about trans people in order to not make similar comments in the future.
And you ask why the laws we have against “violence” are insufficient in protecting transgender individuals?  Just look at the statistics on these crimes against trans people.  The laws are ineffective, and trans people deserve protection.
Mao loved to talk about how people needed to be “educated” (or “re-educated”), too.
” transgender individuals are over 25 times more likely to attempt suicide”
I ask, why one would choose this? Is the benefit worth more than the risk? How many people would choose the expensive transformation without state assistance?
Someone needs to look up the word “transgender”
These letters are an affront to the high journalistic standards of the Daily Trojan, contain no coherent thoughts and should never have been published! I demand an immediate retraction and apology from the Daily Trojan and hope that they will never allow such offensive drivel to stain these hallowed pages. Er, pixels. 
Man. I feel so much better now that I fit in. Oh crap, wrong article? I can never get anything right!
Thank you very much for your letters. The Daily Trojan executive staff members do not seem to understand what is going on. I hope the paper did not publish that ridiculous opinion piece to increase readership of the paper. DT is not MTV and no need to create a show like “Jersey Shore.” I understand readership of DT has declined over the years because of its poor contents that are unrelated to students but creating controversy is not the way to increase readership. Why don’t you learn from Oprah Winfrey and continue the paper with “good intention” without worrying about readership? When your readers feel the connection with DT, then more people will read your paper.
Regardless, I highly recommend DT to issue a statement regarding the controversy.
You responded with much more class and dignity than I could’ve. Great comment. Hopefully the author realizes exactly what she’s saying.
I admire all of you for addressing the misunderstandings in Salama’s article, upsetting as they may be.
Many people, myself included, don’t know very much about the transgender community before going to college, and your efforts to spread awareness and acceptance are really important.
Thank you for bravely speaking out against bullying and discrimination.

I don’t think Ms. Salama is aware that being “accepting of the people who aren’t as comfortable with working with people who identify as transgender” is more or less the default of our society right now.  We don’t need to fight for those people, and to suggest that they need some sort of protection is ridiculous.  On the other hand, transgendered folk have had to fight uphill for a long time for the few legal protections they have.
I’d like to thank the letter writers for their courage in speaking out and their eloquence in rebutting the original op-ed.  Keep up the good work!
(Shad Small, Class of ’07)
A good start! Bravo Trojans! Meanwhile, I’ll assume that a formal apology is forthcoming from the DT. If not, I hope that everyone else who was offended by this will join me in demanding a refund of whatever tuition money was used to subsidize this discriminatory crap.
Also, I’d like to thank Ms. Salama for doing more to raise awareness of trans rights than any other Trojan in my memory. And just in time for the Day of Remembrance, too!
Dear Engie,
While I appreciate that each person is entitled to his or her own opinion, I find it difficult to support opinions that are not founded on any form of research other than the author’s own, limited frame of reference. It is interesting to me that this article was written without any interviews, citations or personal experience to substantiate your argument. To state that we are not considering those who feel “uncomfortable” within the Anti-Discrimination Act, is to place the “uncomfortable person’s” needs above those of transgender individuals. I ask, who gave you the right to do so?
There may be, as you said, “bigger fish to fry” in the scheme of the world, but if smaller cases of injustice and discrimination go unchecked, then larger problems are irrelevant. Personally, I don’t much care about the national budget imbalance if I’m getting bullied every time I leave my house. I sincerely hope that through the comments you’ve received on this article, you will try to see this from the perspective of those affected every day by gender discrimination. I am sure that, at times, you have felt judged in some way, on some aspect of your life, and I find it hard to believe you would be so complacent about giving up your rights to express yourself.  Why then, do you give away another’s freedoms in such a cavalier manner? 
Just something to think about.
Christine Crowley
Good on the responders. Now where is Salama’s apology?
I appreciate everyone’s courage to speak up regarding the issue. Bravo!
Interesting that the name Salama is an Arabic name meaning “Peace.”  What happened?
Good job!!
I commend everyone here for composing their responses to this unsettling opinion piece in such an articulate manner. You have my respect and support, as does the entire LGBTQ+ community.

Throngs of students rioted in the streets in the wee hours. Their numbers and rage increased while cries of delirium punctuated with the tipping of a news van. Police officers used tear gas to control the crowd. What enraged the student population past its boiling point? Their football coach had been fired that night.
Joe Paterno, former head coach of the Penn State Nittany Lions for more than 46 years, was dismissed amid disturbing allegations against the school’s football program. Longtime defensive coordinator Jerry Sandusky, since retired, had recently been charged with 40 counts of child abuse.
The grand jury’s statement released six days prior to Paterno’s termination hit like the nails on a coffin for his career and the reputation of the program he loved. Pedophilia. Rape. Cover-ups. Negligence. Arrogance. These things have no excuse, yet hundreds of angry students seem to declare the opposite.
The man achieved things with football that simply had not been done before, but those achievements are simply rendered unimportant to the conversation when Sandusky’s victims’ pain is taken into account.
How could Paterno, simply by coaching a football team, have gained such reverence in students’ minds to acquit him of his failure to stop the monstrosities happening directly under his leadership? It was only through the unusual position he had taken in the school’s dynamics as living legend and unofficial mascot.
Being in a position of leadership in for 46 years led to his deification.
Sports figures like Michael Jordan, Muhammad Ali and Babe Ruth can easily rise to attain a larger-than-life standing in the eyes of their followers. For the most part, their idolization leads to little. It is only when it is combined with an actual position of leadership, a position where decisions need to be made and situations need to be dealt with, that this kind of idolatry can lead to serious trouble.
Few jobs combine these factors like a successful college coach does. In the spectacle of the high-profile entertainment that is college sports, the fact is that college coaches are there to lead young men and women who are trying to figure out the course their lives will take and despite any success coaches might achieve in leading their teams, these men and women are university employees like professors you see every day.
In a perfectly fair world, coaches would not be treated differently than any of their university-employed counterparts.
With the amount of money college athletics generates, as well as the high-profile nature of the job, fair treatment would be impossible. Allowing someone like Paterno to balloon to the point where his loss is considered an adequate reason to take to the streets and create the level of mayhem witnessed at Penn State, however, is much more avoidable.
It is a matter of keeping things in perspective. College sports have significance, but the gap between their actual and perceived importance can be skewed when someone is elevated in the way Paterno is.
The rioters were misguided; they were only responding in accordance to the mythical stature Paterno attained.

Russian newspaper Izvestiya said Monday that Russian military units will use badminton equipment to improve their eye muscles, reaction speed and cardiovascular strength.
The United Press International reported that 10,000 rackets and tens of thousands of shuttlecocks are being purchased for the units. The sport has gained recent popularity after Russian President Dmirty Medvedev and Prime Minister Vladimir Putin shared a friendly game of badminton.
According to Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty, Colonel Alexander Shchepelev said, “You use the same muscles playing badminton that you use to throw grenades, knives and other objects.” He further added that the sport will be particularly useful for shooters and snipers.
However, Alexander Khramchikhin, deputy director of Russia’s Institute of Political and Military Analysis, said that providing military units with badminton equipment will most likely relieve stress for soldiers rather than improve skills.
News of the badminton tactic quickly elicited mocking laughter in a country that has lost its fearful reputation, according to The Guardian. The defense ministry even denied the use of badminton as a method of training this Monday, saying the sport is “not included in the physical training program for military personnel.”
Nonetheless, Izvestiya stands by its story, saying that the defense ministry is a closed organization that will typically deny strategical practices. The newspaper added that two other sources had confirmed the existence of the badminton plan. “We know it’s true. There are courts. There are rackets.”

The decades-old tradition of “protecting” Tommy Trojan and the Bruin Bear has started a bit early this year, with each school already mounting precautions against vandalism.
As of this past weekend, both Tommy Trojan and the Bruin Bear are already prepared for any possible defacing. Tommy is wrapped in duct tape and will soon be under around-the-clock surveillance by the Trojan Knights, while a box engineered like a jigsaw puzzle encases the Bear. This box reportedly cost more than $5,000, and was first used last season in a response to 2009’s $20,000 worth of damage to the Bear after it was covered in red-and-gold paint. The purchase also accompanied $15,000 worth of security cameras. Tommy Trojan is kept under surveillance through the online TommyCam.
USC and UCLA have been in a back-and-forth battle over who can do the most damage during Rivalry Week for decades. This has resulted in a number of pranks, as well as more serious damage: red paint in UCLA’s fountains; blue-and-gold flagpoles in the USC parking lot; red-and-gold spatters on the Bear; UCLA letters on the USC practice field; and of course, the time Tommy’s arm was sawed off and welded to look as though he was stabbing himself in the back. It is no wonder the Trojan Knights will be camping out to protect our mascot.
As an extra precaution, the new statue of Traveler has also been placed in duct tape. The safety wrappings will not be removed until after the game against UCLA on Nov. 26.

The Story: The Trojans kept the good times rolling against Washington by romping the Huskies to the tune of 40-17.
Junior quarterback Matt Barkley did not have his best game, throwing for a modest 174 yards and one touchdown. Robert Woods, limited by injuries, was quiet too; he only registered just two catches for 5 yards.
Instead of relying on the passing game, USC used budding star Curtis McNeal and a resurgent defense to beat Washington for the first time since 2008. McNeal tallied 148 yards on the ground to go with a touchdown, which came on a dazzling 79-yard scamper in the 3rd quarter.
The Men of Troy got things started early, marching down the field on their second drive of the game and scoring on a 1-yard Barkley touchdown run. Washington answered with a field goal, but the rest of the first half was dominated by USC, with the Trojans notching 16 unanswered points to take a 23-3 lead to the locker room.
The second half opened with a bang as Marqise Lee took the opening boot back 88 yards for a touchdown. When it was all said and done, USC celebrated a 33-point victory over the pesky Huskies, and the Trojans looked most impressive in doing so. USC out gained Washington 252 to 46 on the ground and accounted for almost 200 more total yards, 426-244.
Defensive Dominance: USC shut down a prolific Husky attack from start to finish. Washington came into the game ranked 31st nationally in scoring offense, averaging over 33 points a game. The Huskies were held to just 17 by USC. 1,000-yard rusher and former Trojan commit Chris Polk was stymied, managing just 36 yards on 9 carries. Perhaps most impressively, USC recorded seven sacks and a safety on the Husky tandem of Keith Price and Nick Montana.
Up Next: The Trojans head to Eugene for a revenge game against Oregon, but this one will be a much stiffer test than the Washington game. The No. 4 ranked Ducks are fresh off a massacre of then-No. 3 ranked Stanford Cardinal and are playing some of the best football in the country. USC will have its hands full with the Ducks top ranked rushing attack that spreads the field and challenges defenses to tackle well in space. Last year in the Coliseum, Oregon topped USC 53-32 behind 239 yards and 3 TD from star tailback LaMichael James.
