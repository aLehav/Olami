After a dominating 22-point victory against Long Beach State, the Women of Troy (2-1) now set their sights on playing a much stronger and more physical opponent in the No. 18 Georgia Bulldogs (3-0).  Tip-off is scheduled for 7 p.m. at the Galen Center.
Driving in · Senior guard Jacki Gemelos led the Women of Troy with 14 points against Long Beach State last weekend. USC is currently 2-0. - Tim Tran | Daily Trojan 
With the Bulldogs featuring a  high-powered offense similar to  Duke’s — who beat USC by 25 points last Monday in North Carolina — the Women of Troy expect the same type of game, but believe they’ll be ready to play.
“It’s going to be a similar game like Duke was,” said senior guard Jacki Gemelos. “They’re going to have big, physical girls, but we’re going to have to toughen up and [play].”
After a balanced scoring effort against the 49ers, the coaching staff was very pleased with the way the offense performed on Sunday.
“When players get more accustomed to what we’re trying to do, we look at sharing the basketball,” USC coach Michael Cooper said. “When you share the basketball, everyone’s having fun and working hard for one another.”
Though the Women of Troy employed a different starting lineup against the 49ers, the players still managed to make things work both offensively and defensively.
The Bulldogs are coached by Andy Landers, who is in his 32nd season at Georgia.  They are led by sophomore guard Jasmine James (13.7 points per game) and senior forward Porsha Phillips (11.7 ppg, 10.7 rebounds per game).
Besides those two players, there are other contributors in their frontcourt, including sophomore forwards Jasmine Hassell and Tamika Willis.
With such a big frontline, the Bulldogs have managed to outrebound their opponents by 16 rebounds per game this year.
“We match up well with them, but they’re a very good athletic team,” Cooper said.  “We have our work cut for us.”
One area the coaching staff still emphasizes to the Women of Troy is rebounding and tonight won’t be any different.
“No rebounds — no rings,” Cooper said.  “If you want to compete with the elite teams, you’re going to have to [rebound].”
With such a strong non-conference schedule to begin the season, the Women of Troy have already been tested this year.
But with each practice, the team believes it will continue to get better as long as its hard work and effort translates to the game.
“It starts in practice every day,” Gemelos said.  “If we practice like we have been, it should definitely carry into the game.”

Regina Spektor, renowned for her quirky vocal stylings, narrative songs and soothing-yet-virtuosic piano melodies, recently released an auditory delight suitable for fans and music lovers alike.
The live album is a chance for listeners to appreciate Spektor’s songs and lyrics, but also to admire and discover her raw talent as a live performer.
Spektor — who was touring — made a haphazard decision to turn one of her live shows into a leviathan of an album. She chose the Hammerstein Ballroom in London as the target venue for her album and its accompanying DVD.
The new album proves strong and entertaining with 22 songs, most of which epitomize Spektor’s style and portray the idiosyncrasies of one of the oddest and most interesting musicians on the music scene.
Live in London opens with “On the Radio,” a pulverizing starting piece that embodies Spektor’s repertory: soothing and sincere piano melodies, raw singing that tells a story while lamenting something pertinent and unique singing embellishments.
Spektor accents the “o” in “On the Radio,” which works as a tantalizing ploy to elicit applause from audience members.
Spektor could not have picked a more perfect audience to play for. The enthusiasm and energy is palpable throughout the CD, especially during segues between songs.
Next is “Eet,” another one of Spektor’s well-known hits.  As soon as the first piano notes are played, screams and hoorahs flood the track’s audio.
“Eet” is highlighted by the a mesh of string instruments, Spektor’s piano and background drums, creating a serene instrumental mood. The virtuosic, high-hitting range of Spektor’s voice flirts with the piano melody, and a peculiar beat-boxing conclusion adds to the unique nature of the track.
“Apres Moi” bridges the listener between two of Spektor’s other popular songs with an impenetrable piano introduction that blends appropriately with Spektor’s lyrics. The song is ominous with dark lyrics and a recurring theme of impending doom.
With spurts of French lyrics and an extensive, passionate Russian verse, coupled with natural echo effects created by Spektor repeating certain words louder and then softer, “Apres Moi” serves as the polestar of Spektor’s creative talent in the album.
It is evident that Spektor realizes the sheer exuberance of her audience as she embraces them and gives thanks before her monologue-esque “Silly Eye Color Generalizations.” Spektor’s lyrics are at points poetic and at other times humorously silly — hence the song title. “Silly Eye Color Generalizations” seems like it would be a passionate but witty poem, exemplifying Spektor’s talent as a writer.
Spektor’s choice for the set list is interesting, as she pairs antithetical songs with abrupt transitions. For example, “Ode to Divorce” is a song filled with almost-tangible emotion and remorse. Interestingly enough, it is followed by “That Time,” one of Spektor’s most humorous songs, which contains a simple, repetitive guitar riff, vocal spikes, dark humor about overdosing and a lingering lyrical feeling.
Regardless of Spektor’s song choice, the audience clearly loves the set as Spektor’s album marches on. During “Fidelity” the audience sings along, and applause layers the progressions between all of the album’s tracks.
As a whole, Live in London feels like an auditory epic because it is so long. The length, however, serves as a portfolio of Spektor’s talent.
Live in London is a successful blend of Spektor’s more experimental songs such as “Hotel Song” and “Folding Chair,” where she attempts to sing like a dolphin, and Spektor’s more traditional songs like “Us” and “Wallet.”
The singer demonstrates her lyrical talent in “Blue Lips,” “The Calculation,” “Machine” and “Man of a Thousand Faces,” songs that take the listener through interesting stories and scenarios.
The song that really stands out is “The Call” because of how it slows the momentum of the album and set. However, with “Love, You’re a Whore,” however, Spektor engages the audience in an awe-inspiring hoe-down-like finale.
“Love, You’re a Whore” is an exciting end to an album and performance that is entertaining and practically unblemished. The London crowd claps and sings along, giving Spektor generous background vocals to add to the splendor of the song.
Live in London will not fail to please Spektor fans, but will also reveal to other music lovers a talented performer who magnifies her music with creativity and idiosyncrasies that are hard to come by in today’s popular music world.

Self-taught guitarist and junior Will Sturgeon was rejected twice from USC’s music industry major before landing in the new pop music program in 2010.
Now record labels are pursuing the sophomore’s beachside pop rock group The Smiles. And after their latest show at the Roxy Theatre on the Sunset Strip, Sturgeon and his indie band of brothers are poised to ride their potentially hit songs into the musical stratosphere.
There’s nothing like rejection to kick-start a career.
Before he could conjugate verbs, let alone write lyrics, Sturgeon’s parents started him on the piano.
From kindergarten on, he played keyboard in various scholastic groups, such as his middle school jazz band. Then, during his sophomore year of high school, Sturgeon taught himself how to play guitar from one of those notorious “How to” books. He also learned to record tracks.
Although initially rejected from the music industry program, Sturgeon landed on his feet and joined the ranks of fellow musician  Peter Lee Johnson in the pop music program.
His dream of professional musicianship truly began to take shape, however, when he met John McGrath, a senior majoring in creative writing.
“John and I started writing together in the spring of my freshman year,” Sturgeon said. “And by the fall of sophomore year, John convinced Brendan Kirlin, his friend from Baltimore, to come live out to L.A. and play in a band with us.”
To round out the group, Sturgeon and McGrath called on USC’s own Mark Edwards, a junior, to play drums, and The Smiles were quickly invited to play local shows and USC engagements.
The band then self-recorded its debut release, the EP Hermosa, in the basement of a friend’s house this summer.
These are the humble beginnings of a rock ‘n’ roll band.
More recently, The Smiles opened for Young the Giant at the Roxy on the Sunset Strip, which Sturgeon said he considers to be the highlight of the band’s career. He was ecstatic The Smiles could be on the same stage that had featured Bob Dylan, David Bowie, The Red Hot Chili Peppers, Prince and Bruce Springsteen.
Since the inception of their collaboration, The Smiles have also played KXSC Music Festival — as the event’s only student band — as well as the Muirstock festival at UCSD and the Neon Reverb Festival in Las Vegas.
“The beginning of this year has been really encouraging,” Sturgeon said. “We’ve gotten some great gigs and attention.”
But even with the bands success, The Smiles are still a band trying to break into the behemoth that is the music industry. So what is it about the music industry that scares people? What is it that deters them from pursuing an exclusive career in that field? And why is Sturgeon not worried?
In this era more than ever, a band needs to have a built-in audience or a proven style to warrant scouting by big players. Because the industry itself is insecure, it is becoming more difficult to find a stable career as an artist.
Successful musicians, too, are often derivative or even blatant mimickers of previous idols, giving the industry a numbing and cyclical reputation.
But something also needs to be said about the abundance of opportunities that still exist as small, budding labels spring up yearly and support new provocative, original and revolutionary artists.
Every week, the radio, television or the Internet introduces us to a bold new artist that we’ve never heard of, or a friend sends us a YouTube video of his buddy back in Baltimore who just played a remarkable live set at a club or coffeehouse.
What’s so encouraging is that the members of The Smiles are living their dream, despite the odds.
People always talk about doing what makes them happy, which has become a cliché, rather than a desired goal. The problem is that it fails to address happiness found outside of a career, such as the joy of family, which may demand a certain kind of career stability.
People can find happiness in any career, even if it’s sporadic, which disguises the underlying desire for change and self-betterment.
Financial stability leads to happiness in a way, but this is not the same as stability of the soul. Doing what you love rids your world of voids, which a life of compromise demands that you fill. When you pursue what you love, you exist in a world of abundance and not of emptiness.
For The Smiles, a band most people probably have never heard of, the music industry isn’t dying. If anything, they are tangible proof that it’s not even broken.
“The dream was always to be able to make a living off of what I love to do,” Sturgeon said.

The holiday season has officially arrived.
It’s almost Thanksgiving and in preparation, Americans across the country are flocking to grocery stores to stock up on turkeys, potatoes, cranberries and pumpkin purée ad nauseam.
What most people don’t know, however, is that virtually none of these modern “Thanksgiving staples” were on the table in 1621 at the original Thanksgiving feast.
The pilgrims of Plymouth Plantation actually enjoyed — according to the only written account of the historical meal — a hearty menu of venison, duck and seafood (instead of turkey), squash, cabbage and corn (in place of green bean casserole and mashed potatoes), as well as dried blueberries with honey (presumably a precursor to pumpkin pie).
So while racing down the aisles, frantically searching for the next item on your shopping list, consider breaking free from the traditional Thanksgiving dishes and putting a little spin on your Turkey Day meal this year.
The following recipes turn up the volume on the standard mashed potatoes, green bean casserole and pumpkin pie, but are equally delicious and will be sure to satisfy everyone’s Thanksgiving cravings.
The Original: Mashed Potatoes
The Twist: Roasted Herbed Potatoes
A crispy alternative to your traditional, creamy mashed potato dish, these oven-roasted, herbed potatoes are easy to make and even more delicious to eat.
Ingredients:
-3 tablespoons butter
-1 tablespoon olive oil
-4 onions, sliced
-2 pounds potatoes, thinly sliced
-Kosher salt
-Fresh ground black pepper
-Fresh thyme sprigs
-2 cups chicken stock
Directions:
-Preheat the oven to 300 degrees Fahrenheit
-Melt the butter and olive oil in a medium sauté pan, add sliced onions and sauté until they are tender and lightly golden in color (about 15 minutes).
-Spread half of the sautéed onions in the bottom of a large casserole dish.
-Place a layer of sliced potatoes on top, season with salt and pepper and sprinkle with thyme leaves.
-Repeat by adding the second half of the onions, a final layer of potatoes and finally cover with the chicken stock.
-Cover the pan with foil and bake until all of the liquid has been absorbed (two-three hours).
*Note: remove the foil for the last hour if you prefer a crisp top to the potatoes.
The Original: Green Bean Casserole
The Twist: Roasted Green Beans with Shallots and Walnuts
These roasted green beans are not only healthier than your standard green bean casserole, but the freshness from the lemon zest and parsley combination and the crunch from the walnuts make them simply irresistible.
Ingredients:
-1 pound green beans
-3 tablespoons olive oil
-4 shallots, thinly sliced
-Kosher salt
-Fresh-ground black pepper
-1/4 cup walnuts (lightly toasted and coarsely chopped)
-1 tablespoon finely chopped lemon zest
-2 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley leaves
Directions:
-Preheat oven to 425 degrees Fahrenheit.
-Toss the green beans in a large baking dish with the shallots and olive oil. Season with salt and pepper.
-Roast green beans in the oven until golden brown (about 15-18 minutes).
-In a separate bowl, combine chopped walnuts, lemon zest and parsley.
-Transfer roasted green beans to serving platter and top with walnut mixture.
The Original: Pumpkin Pie
The Twist: Pumpkin Cheesecake
No Thanksgiving dinner is complete without dessert, so this year, try baking this decadent pumpkin cheesecake instead of the old standard pumpkin pie. It will fulfill all of your pumpkin pie cravings, and with the added richness from the cream cheese, you’ll be sure to go back for seconds.

By now one thing should be clear: Kanye West is not a perfect man.
Heck, it’s debatable whether he’s even half-decent sometimes. From his notorious post-Hurricane Katrina outburst that “[George W.] Bush doesn’t care about black people” to his interrupting not one, but two awards presentations — first the MTV Europe Music Awards, then the infamous 2009 Video Music Awards incident with Taylor Swift — he has a knack for creating controversy.
Photos courtesy of Def Jam 
Even President Barack Obama chimed in, calling West a “jackass.” Ouch.
With the release of his new album, My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy, another thing has become clear: West is a consistently masterful musician, throwing down albums that are not just good but also brutally creative.
My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy is so great not just because of his talent but because of everything that has come before: his earlier albums, particularly the polarizing 808s & Heartbreak, but more importantly his prominent, checkered rise to fame.
What makes Fantasy come alive isn’t just that his flowing lyricism shreds anything in recent memory, or that the instrumentals are intensely emotive, inspired constructions of sound — they are, but that’s not the point.
It’s a special, critical X-factor that can make an album more than just a collection of well-made tunes. It’s what the Dow Chemical Company calls the “human element” — and boy, does Fantasy deliver on it.
How else can you explain West’s vulnerable personality on display here, which runs the gamut of schizophrenic, self-conscious, sneeringly boastful and simultaneously fragile?
It’s the first time he’s been this open, this honest, and it makes every song the better for it. Though other rap artists might show their softer sides, West does it on Fantasy without seeming contradictory.
When Nicki Minaj opens the album by declaring, Twisted fiction / Sick addiction / Gather ‘round children / Zip it, listen, the journey into West’s world begins, not relenting until the final note of “Who Will Survive in America” fades away.
It’s probably an understatement to point out that Fantasy does many, many things well. The first track on the album, “Dark Fantasy,” is a brilliant gateway to the rest of the songs, notable for both grand, subconsciously tragic chorus that asks, Can we get much higher?, to the lush, layered background of choral singing and orchestral strings.
In some ways the song is a very loose summary of the album itself: the theme of flawed power and humanity, the intricate instrumentals intertwined with minimalist, electronic influences, the inventive bridges and breaks that build and shatter tension.
This is not to say, however, that the rest of the album is predictable. Far from it, in fact.
How about the third track, “Power”? The vaguely tribal vocalizations are one thing, but the fuzzily distorted guitar melody? It’s perfect. The fractured, frenetic drum beat hints at the beats found on his previous album. And out of nowhere, a sample from “21st Century Schizoid Man” — a King Crimson song.
Kafka probably couldn’t have dreamed up a song with a more absurd blend of ingredients.
And yet West makes it work. And again following his motif, West first lets loose with a joyous declaration, I’m livin’ in the 21st century / Doin’ something mean to it / Do it better than anybody you seen do it, only to continue by telling the world he’s Trippin’ off the power, then to follow up by contemplating suicide. This would be a beautiful death / I’m jumpin’ out the window / I’m lettin’ everything go.
This isn’t just the egotistical, narcissistic West we’ve seen on TV, making a fool of himself. It’s the egotistical, narcissistic West, but one that’s full of doubt, lonely and defensive and faltering under the weight of his own swagger.
But it’s not just West doing West, either. The album features a plethora of guest appearances, all of them talented musicians contributing some of their best. Even better, the appearances aren’t just there for the sake of a glorified shout-out; instead, they play a significant role in Fantasy’s ultimate purpose.
Kid Cudi jumps in early on “Gorgeous,” playing both the part of Kanye’s inner thoughts as well as his ominous subconscious. “Monster” features an awe-inspiring extended verse by Minaj, who effortlessly spits fire from three or four different personas.
And the devastatingly haunting “Blame Game” highlights John Legend’s silky vocals and finishes with a comedic dialogue by Chris Rock, wholly unfunny not because of its delivery but because of the context the song establishes.
There’s not enough room in this review to compliment all the guests, or the lyrics, or the beats, or West’s execution. It’s perhaps a testament to the album that this is the case. There are maybe a few nits to be picked — “So Appalled” could be tighter, shorter — but it’s a reach.
There’s no filler to be had here, and no song should be treated as such; each piece stands tall on its own.
But the most special part of My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy is that West, by pointing so vividly to his own misfortunes, lessons, regrets and moments of clarity, asks us to not only see him for what he is — a flawed human being — but to see ourselves as what we are equally flawed human beings.
There’s nothing more soothing than knowing you can share not just success, but failure as well.
I’m so gifted at findin’ what I don’t like the most / So I think it’s time for us to have a toast, West says in “Runaway.”
Here’s to you.
Absolutely loving the reaction from people who are mad about Kanye’s universal great, nearly perfect reviews. It has really made my day.
The indy rock geeks crying on twitter about Rolling Stone and Pitchfork’s 10/10 were the best though.
I guess it wouldn’t be Kanye if someone wasn’t getting their panties up in a bunch.
Congrats to Kanye, it seems that being the most hated has only pushed him to create another classic.

For students that frequent the less-than-sparkling beaches punctuating California’s coastline, it’s easy to think of the ocean as the place where we jettison all things polluted or unwieldy.

And for every discarded Dos Equis bottle or plastic Target bag that we  see lining the piers, we can be sure of an exponentially greater number that we don’t. The Great Pacific Garbage Patch, that behemoth floating landfill that is one, two, three times the size of the continental United States — no one’s really sure — serves as a decidedly unattractive Exhibit A.
Thankfully, we’ve started putting the Pacific to better use.
California is now one of several states taking on pilot projects to explore the ability of tides to provide electricity. If further invested in, hydrokinetic endeavors could theoretically overtake hydropower dams in energy output, providing up to 10 percent of the nation’s electric power, according to the Los Angeles Times.
California’s coastline, specifically around Santa Barbara, Calif., is one of the few areas in the United States that easily facilitates hydrokinetic projects, and with the state’s reputation as an environmental trailblazer, we would seem to be the clear choice to spearhead a shift toward hydrokinetic energy.
Which is why it’s surprising that out of all the states in which hydrokinetic studies and projects are currently underway — including Washington, Alaska, Florida, Oregon, Hawaii and New York — California is among those struggling the most to find support.
Pacific Gas & Electric Co. was recently forced to postpone a promising hydrokinetic pilot project, WaveConnect, in Northern California’s Humboldt County, because of a “difficulty of obtaining permits and the high cost of development,” according to the Los Angeles Times.
The $50-million project would have been groundbreaking, the first substantial effort to test a variety of wave power generators in one area. There’s talk of the project being relocated to Santa Barbara, but nothing concrete has been decided. Other areas of California aren’t faring much better, though for some, such as Palo Alto, Calif., the physical obstacles are proving to be much more problematic than any budgetary constraints.
There have been strong indications in the last few months that hydrokinetic power is growing in popularity.
The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission has issued 140 hydrokinetic permits, where before it granted only a few, and the U.S. Department of Energy announced in September $37 million in grants to fund 27 different marine and hydrokinetic projects.
Meanwhile, businesses are making headway across the nation, as evidenced by  Ocean Renewable Power Co. in Maine, Ocean Power Technologies in Hawaii and Oregon, and Snohomish County Public Utility District in Washington.
California can’t afford to be left behind.
The concept of hydropower is not new. Former President Franklin D. Roosevelt wanted to construct tidal dikes to capture electric power as early as 1935 (the project was stymied by an unsympathetic Congress). What’s new is the interest the nation is now taking in it and the strides the technology is subsequently making.
Much as with other branches of alternative energy, there’s a lot of economic potential in hydrokinetic power. Between the growing national spotlight on the field and California’s need for new sources of revenue, now is the time to capitalize on that potential — not the time to pass the environmental baton to Maine.
Unfortunately, the inevitable flip side is that hydrokinetic turbines are costly, as is the technology for pretty much any form of alternative energy. As evidenced by the suspension of the WaveConnect project, sometimes that expense is too much to manage.
But we need to make the effort.
New York is struggling with debt, too, and yet it’s still finding ways to explore the hydrokinetic power of the East River. Percentage-wise, Alaska, Maine, Washington and Florida also boast a higher debt-to-GDP ratio than California, and they’re all still making headway with wave energy.
As hydrokinetic power finds its way into the news more and more, California too needs to explore ways to incorporate it into the state budget.  For both its economic and environmental benefits, we need to lead, not follow, the upcoming pilot projects in hydrokinetic energy.

Airport security has certainly been beefed up over the last month. The most notable additions to the security lines that students can expect to see on their homeward-bound Thanksgiving trips are full body scanners. Los Angeles International Airport is one of the approximately 60 airports outfitted with the new technology.
The scanners, which use advanced imaging technology, take what is essentially a black and white nude picture of the subject. If a passenger tapes, glues, attaches or wears something that is potentially dangerous, then it’s a pretty safe bet the scanner will pick it up.
Passengers have the right to refuse a full body scan, but there is a catch that many passengers have passionately complained about: an intimate and thorough pat-down that gives Transportation Security Agency staff the right to examine a person’s inner thighs, breasts and buttocks.
Understandably, passengers have complained about such pat-downs. They are intrusive, and they can be humiliating. At the same time, Kate Hanni, Executive Director of FlyersRights.org, stated in a recent New York Times article that “There seems to be a huge variation in how they’re patting people down.”
Still, the heightened thoroughness of airport security is necessary and should not be compromised for the sake of convenience.
Airport security lines can be long and tiresome, but ease of mind is well worth the added inconvenience.
It’s been less than a year since Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab successfully boarded a Northwest Airlines flight hiding an explosive device in his underwear. Either the full body scan or a pat-down would probably have detected Abdulmatallab’s home-made bomb.
John S. Pistole, a TSA administrator, recently said in a statement, “We all wish we lived in a world where security procedures at airports weren’t necessary, but that just isn’t the case.”
The very least we can do is make sure nothing dangerous is allowed on flights.
Opponents of the scanners and pat-downs include public interest groups, such as the American Civil Liberties Union, as well as medical and science professors who argue that the scanners pose a potential health risk because of the small doses of radiation used in about half of the machines.
Homeland Security, however, has stated that the Food and Drug Administration and Johns Hopkins University have tested the safety of such technology extensively.
President Barack Obama recently addressed the TSA heightened security measures as well. Speaking at a NATO press conference in Lisbon, Portugal, the president said that the increased security is needed to prevent another Christmas Day bombing.
No one is denying the extra hassle the body scans or pat-downs add to a passenger’s travel plans. But everyone should be willing to sacrifice to ensure our personal and national safety.
A USA Today/Gallup poll confirmed that the majority of travelers approve of the TSA’s increased security measures. In the poll, 78 percent of respondents support the full body scanners. The survey only reached a small sample size  — 542 adults — but those who were questioned had flown at least twice in the last year.
Those who supported the new security measures rightly understand what needs to be done to keep our country safe.
The increased security measures will make flights more secure. We should all accept the inconvenience with a grain of salt, and feel a little comforted when we fly home this Thanksgiving break.

We have had eight+ years without these nude scanners and enhanced pat downs. Including the 9/11 attacks, there have been only 21 people that succeeded on getting on a plane and trying to take it down. There are over 10,000 flights a day! We do not NEED these techniques to keep us safe. We are already safe. It is the law enforcement efforts away from the airports that is keeping us safe. The  nude scanners and enhanced pat downs are just to show the American Citizens that their government is out of control and their hired goons can violate the Fourth Amendment anytime they want without any EVIDENCE. 
Buying an airplane ticket is not probable cause!
Brilliant comparison, Colin. Yes, security screenings at airports are similar to the systematic slaughter of millions of innocent people. Yes, some minor discomfort is similar to the gestapo busting down doors and ripping children from their parents. I hope everyone in Australia isn’t as absurdly ignorant as to compare the greatest mass murderer of the last century, if not all time, to a full body scan and a pat down. If flying on an airplane is akin to being in a concentration camp, you should probably just stay in Sydney.
Anon: Flying on an airplane is a privilege. It’s a perk. There are plenty of other modes of transportation for those who can’t stand a little personal discomfort for the safety of millions of people. I’ll feel much safer on an airplane without you on it. Thanks.
This is an ignorant response. Ever heard of the slippery slope, Daniel? That is what happens when people allow a government to treat them like cattle, or perhaps more accurately, sheep.
However, we would at least have something to discuss if the TSA were making us one bit safer. They are not. They have caught NO terrorists. The underwear bomber and shoe bomber (who most likely would NOT have been caught by the scanner or a fast food reject TSA patdown expert) were foiled by PASSENGERS. That’s right – the people who are being treated like criminals. 
The government does not have the RIGHT to search your person without probable cause. If your passport shows you’ve been to Yemen lately, that MIGHT give them the right to pat your privates. But for the rest of us, the answer is NO.
I am not defending the gov’t, Diane. I fully agree with what you’re saying. I think you misunderstood my post. I am very critical of the decisions made by the DHS so far and I do not believe the people, myself included, should submit to invasive pat-downs that are often only reserved for hard criminals in prison known to cause problems.
In Iraq, we often avoided searching kids, and if possible, women. The reality for us was a balance of security vs public relations. Our mission would be a failure if we started subjecting kids to invasive pat downs and manipulating their rights as human beings. Instead, children were visually searched by having them lift their shirts and spin. Yes, this is easy to countermeasure; however, one’s body language never lies. We have caught kids with weapons, without needing to touch them. If a search was necessary, the parents would manipulate the child. We never dared think to touch someone’s kid, it fuels discontent.
Being a member of the military, I cannot get too political on this debate. Hence, why I originally did not form a solid opinion on DHS/TSA. If you want want, I think they are doing a bad job. They even harass us on our tours; even though we are carrying solid steel equipment, I was still forced to turn over my Sprite–on a 100% armed military flight. :)
Crap, I just noticed the other guy above me was also named “Daniel.” I should change my name next post (see below for my original). Sorry for any confusion this may cause.
PETN has been used by terrorists for over 30 years; yet, however, DHS buys ridiculous scanners, scanners that will not detect this rather simple explosive. So, even after all the invasive pat downs and scans, a motivated bomber will find a way to get past security–because there is none. There are no detection devices in place to interact this this compound. The ones that are there, they are typically tested against commercially developed explosives (i.e. Semtex).
Likewise, until we actually use our intelligence AS intelligence, we will always be a soft target. The underwear bomber was discovered weeks before his attempted attack. Yet, he was allowed to move freely, from Yemen no less. How many fun loving men get on flights from Yemen? al-Awlaki was from Yemen. :) How retarded and utterly unforgivable. Yet, TSA has us take our shoes off… yet probably have no clue what they are looking for in those shoes. Maybe misplaced nail clippers? I can easily doubt that every “agent” is trained and qualified to find what he thinks he is looking for.
The goal of terrorists is to strike a target by simple means but meaningful enough to discourage a civilization. TSA will tire themselves to death with reactive surgeries, ultimately alienating their meaning to the public and putting us in a worse state of affairs. I know people cite Israel is a prime example to emulate as a baseline. This has always been the case. Israel’s counter-insurgency is THE BEST, and has been a valuable ally to our military. Why the hell then is there such pride in the other departments? Is it really such a bitch to ask for help on this issue?
By sacrificing our liberties a day at a time; American have fallen victim to the # goal of terrorism. The maxim of terrorists is never essentially a simple maxim of death. Death creates the wave that spreads the pollution. The publics fear is the desire, the control is the end result. If we carry on like this we will implode into ourselves and fall. It’s too simple. This is why the true meaning of terrorists doesn’t technically exist in US. There are few groups which aim for this reality that are home bred. Hence, why profiling is so attractive. Yes, there have been school shootings. Yes, we all remember McVeigh. These men’s goals were, minor, in the ideology that is terrorism. Good luck locating an American extremist group filled with a Christian demographic which hopes to bring utter fear and disarray to the American public by causing mind numbing fear to a gigantic population through what is called a “war of a thousand cuts.” If this were our reality, our military would be well engaged in the homeland. :)
Those who would give up Essential Liberty to purchase a little Temporary Safety, deserve neither Liberty nor Safety.
-Benjamin Franklin
Sorry Mr. Fay but you need to dig a lot deeper , way deeper, and wake up from the sleep that you and so many Americans have been under for far too long. I am sure that after the TSA criminality  you have sat down and rationalized the need for your Constitution to be trashed once again because of the fear which has been manufactured by your government. They are the terrorists and once you do your homework properly , be honest and carry out journalism for the truth rather than the paycheck we will all be a lot safer. This terrorist threat is manufactured to gain your compliance. Come on – wake up. Your country is eerily akin to Nazi Germany under Hitler – this is exactly how it started there. Trust me – it is so clear to evreybody looking in. The internationalist banksters are trying to destroy your country because they fear the US constitution. You should protect it with all your life !!

This winter break, several USC students will travel to Africa with a team of 40 people to take part in “Steps over Swaziland.”
SOS is a campaign intended to bring relief and awareness to Swaziland, a small country in Africa that has the highest incidence of HIV/AIDS.
According to Abhirukt Sapru, a sophomore majoring in business administration who will be taking part in the trip, statistics predict that by the year 2020, the AIDS epidemic could be responsible for the death of Swaziland’s adult population.
“A lot of the funds and resources are going to much bigger countries with problems of less magnitude,” Sapru said. “What we hope that SOS will do is draw people’s attention to Swaziland and actually help people understand the real dire problems that are going on there.”
One World Futbol Project collaborated with FUNDaFIELD, a non-profit organization co-founded by USC students Garrett Weiss and his brother, Kyle, to organize SOS.
The organization fundraises to build soccer fields in impoverished communities. The One World Futbol Project joined FUNDaFIELD to provide highly durable — if not entirely indestructible — soccer balls to complement the fields, Garrett Weiss said.
“We’ll be going to about five [community centers] and holding soccer tournaments there, doing clothing exchanges — that kind of thing for the orphanages — as well as giving out AIDS awareness information the entire time and lots of AIDS prevention resources,” said Garrett Weiss, a sophomore majoring in business administration.
The USC students on the FUNDaFIELD team will be dribbling one of One World’s soccer balls across Swaziland — a journey that is approximately 130 miles.
They will run about 10 to 15 miles each day and deliver the One World soccer balls, jerseys and HIV/AIDS resources at community centers for orphans along the way, Weiss said.
FUNDaFIELD plans to construct a field at El Shaddai orphanage, the last stop on their trip.
To some, the idea of devoting funds to developing soccer fields and distributing balls might seem to detract resources from solving the severe problems at hand, such as HIV/AIDS, said Tim Jahnigen, inventor of the One World Futbol.
However, both FUNDaFIELD and the One World Futbol project acknowledge the significance soccer has on children in poverty, Jahnigen said.
“Play and sports reinforce community and conflict resolution and all kinds of things,” Jahnigen said.
Jahnigen said he was inspired to create a lasting soccer ball for the One World Futbol Project after watching a documentary about the children in Darfur refugee camps who resorted to playing soccer with balls made of trash. Although many relief efforts have been put in place to help these children, the soccer balls provided don’t last long before they are punctured or otherwise destroyed, he said.
“Our vision is to support the work of organizations like FUNDaFIELD,” Jahnigen said. “If you can provide a ball that doesn’t go flat into an environment that is incredibly poor but full of children, it allows the children to play to their hearts’ content instead of until the ball is destroyed.”
One World hopes to distribute one million balls to poor communities across the globe within three years, Jahnigen said. So far, around 15,000 balls have been provided through donations and their “buy one, give one” commercial program.
“When I had the idea for the ball, it was only meant for children in harsh environments and the idea of making money off of it or making a business out of it was the last thing on my mind. It was just really thinking about children, their needs,” Jahnigen said. “That part of the story has always been the major driving force behind the project.”
For SOS, Jahnigen said he hopes to be able to provide between 500 to 1,000 balls for the FUNDaFIELD team to deliver to Swaziland.
“We’re all ecstatic, we’re all really looking forward to it,” Sapru said. “We all just can’t wait.”
Weiss said he is also enthusiastic for the upcoming SOS trip.
“Once you go to Africa, you are able to realize the effects of your work and you’re able to see what else needs to be done,” Weiss said. “When you go, you just get so excited to do more and I’m hoping that’s what comes out of this for everyone else on the trip.”
guess that’s it for swaziland’s local small business football manufacturers, then…

Though a recent report indicated that the number of U.S. students traveling abroad declined during the 2008-2009 school year, this trend was not seen at USC.
The “Open Doors Report on International Educational Exchange,” an annual report that measures the number of students traveling outside the United States, was released last week by the Institute of International Education. Approximately 1,000 higher education institutions in the United States contributed to the report, including USC.
This was the first time in 25 years that the numbers had decreased. The study found that from the 2007-2008 to the 2008-2009 school year, there was a decline of 0.8 percent in the number of students choosing to study abroad.
Peggy Blumenthal, executive vice president and chief operating officer of the institute, said the economy played a large role in causing this decrease.
“The serious economic challenges that American families and U.S. campuses were facing in 2008 certainly affected participation rates in study abroad that year,” Blumenthal said in an e-mail.
At USC, however, the numbers have been increasing moderately since 2007.
In the 2007-2008 academic year, the Open Doors survey reported that 1,931 USC students traveled abroad. In 2008 to 2009, the number rose to 2,348, making USC number five in the top institutions that sent students abroad.
Stephen Bucher, chair of the Off-Campus Studies Panel committee and director of the Engineering Writing Program at the Viterbi School of Engineering, said there are three main reasons why the study abroad numbers have been increasing at USC.
“One is that the university leadership has made globalization one of the priorities of the university,” he said. “That has an effect on encouraging students and faculty to participate in these types of efforts.”
The other two reasons, he said, are the innovative new study abroad programs that faculty are creating and the enthusiasm of the students.
“For whatever reason, the students who come to USC tend to want to go abroad,” he said.
Daniella Acuna, a junior majoring in international relations, will be studying abroad in Spain next spring.
Acuna said she had always planned on studying abroad.
“USC wants you to have a really full college experience and I think studying abroad is one of the best things you can do in college,” she said.
Despite the slight national decrease in the number of students traveling abroad, Blumenthal said a fall 2010 survey conducted in cooperation with the Forum on Education Abroad indicated that the study abroad numbers are already beginning to rebound.
“More than half of the campuses responding (55 percent) said they had seen an increase in the number of their students studying abroad in 2009-10 compared to the previous year,” she wrote.
In addition, the Open Doors report also found that students are now choosing less traditional destinations for their time abroad.
Four of the top five destinations  — the United Kingdom, Italy, Spain and France — have witnessed declines in the number of exchange students over the past couple of years.
However, the number of students traveling to China, the last of the top five countries, has increased steadily in the last two years.
Bucher said this trend is also seen at USC.
“The new programs that are being proposed tend to be in more non-traditional locations,” he said.
Blumenthal said, however, that many students are still interested in studying in the more popular locations.
“The U.S. continues to have strong educational ties to countries in Western Europe,” she wrote.
Colleen Brosnan, a junior majoring in neuroscience and international relations, said she is planning on traveling abroad in Prague next fall.
Brosnan said she traveled to China for the summer two years ago and thought about spending the semester there.
“I considered going there for the whole semester, but I decided I wanted to go somewhere different,” she said. “I’ve heard really good things about it.”

A group of six graduate students from the School of Cinematic Arts will embark on a seven-month walk across the country in hopes of cultivating an open dialogue about same-sex marriage while documenting their journey on film.
A.J. Goodrich, a third-year graduate student studying cinema-television production who developed the idea, will direct the film. He and the other students will begin walking on Feb. 1.
The goal of the project is to engage a variety of people along the way in a conversation about gay marriage and other gay civil rights issues, Goodrich said.
“Probably a lot of people who are out there in the [United States] in rural communities, for example, haven’t met a lot of gay people,” he said. “Just coming face to face I think would give them an opportunity to level with someone on a human, basic level.”
Goodrich said he was inspired to create the movie because of his experiences growing up.
“I just don’t want other kids who are growing up gay to have to go through what I had to go through,” he said. “I want to be a positive role model for them and give them some hope.”
Goodrich said traveling across the country would enable the conversation to be more inclusive, as he intends to invite people from both sides of the issue to join in as the crew walks.
Jed Dannenbaum, a senior lecturer in School of Cinematic Arts and Goodrich’s faculty supervisor, said the students’ decision to walk carries social and historic significance.
“It’s an interesting, compelling combination of personal journey and exploration of America and at the same time reminiscent of the great civil rights marches of the past,” he said.
Dannenbaum said he hopes the walk will generate publicity for gay rights.
“It’s a dramatic effort that might well attract both local media and attention from individuals who are supportive of this [and] maybe some larger feature coverage of it particularly as they get well along into the process,” Dannenbaum said.
Goodrich said that although the legalization of gay marriage is an important first step, it is merely one step in the long process of obtaining full equality.
“The greater acceptance and more awareness we have of the real damaging effects that [things like] bullying can have or not having equal rights can have — if people were aware of that, I think we could make strides towards achieving equality,” Goodrich said.
Satinder Kaur, a graduate student studying cinema-television production, is one of the film’s producers. She said the group is working on completing fundraising — most of which is coming from family and friends.
“We’re using online platforms like IndieGoGo, which is a great tool. It’s very new,” she said. “You can put up your project and get your family and friends to donate. It [also] allows you to give other people your e-mail and share updates, and if they like your project, they will give you money.”
Kaur said the group hopes to get media sponsorship and other organizations involved. The group also created a Facebook page called “The Road Less Travelled By.”
In light of the recent string of suicides committed by gay teenagers and young adults, Goodrich said it is important for universities to continue providing the right resources to support and protect students.
USC has resources for students who are seeking support for bullying issues, Goodrich said, but he isn’t convinced people always know where to find them.
“I’m not sure they’re very visible unless you go out looking for them,” he said. “But, to my knowledge, most people at USC have been incredibly accepting and kind and supportive.”
The film crew will start in San Francisco in February and move south, continue up through the East Coast and finally end in Boston around Labor Day. They will walk 20 to 25 miles a day and travel a total of 4,000 miles.
“The reason [Goodrich is] choosing this is because there’s been a tradition of walking for religious, civil rights [and] all kinds of freedom,” Kaur said. “By physically stretching for something you believe in, you can reach out.”
I don’t want to sound disrespectful in any way and am all for peoples freedoms to do what they want but I wonder how people would react in the urban settings if we did a walk in regards to family or religious rights? Would those people be understanding and tolerant? Just a thought
Gay marriage is already available in multiple states and countries. However lifestyle changes must be made to achieve it. How much does a gay person want marriage? Enough to leave their home? Many heteros leave their state or country to get married. Why should gays get a special right to not have to leave their state or country?
Gay people and fictional gay characters over populate pop culture. The problem is not lack of awareness in the USA.
What? You make no sense and don’t understand the idea behind gay marriage. Gay marriage is not recognized by the Federal Government which means that gay spouses do not have the same rights and protection as hetero-sexual couples. “Gays” are not asking for special rights, just equal rights. It is apparent that your awareness on this issue is exactly why AJ and his team are making the film.

The football team lost three key members to injury during Saturday’s 36-7 loss against Oregon State. Sophomore quarterback Matt Barkley, redshirt junior tailback Marc Tyler and redshirt junior linebacker Chris Galippo all sat out the second half, and their statuses for this Saturday’s home game against Notre Dame are unknown.
Barkley suffered a high-ankle sprain right before halftime as he was sacked on an attempted fourth-down conversion. He returned to the sideline late in the third quarter sporting crutches and a walking boot on his left leg.
“My ankle just got twisted out,” Barkley said. “I tried to roll out of the sack and it just rolled me up. If I hadn’t worn my knee brace then my knee would have been blown out so this is better than that.”
X-rays on Sunday showed that there are no broken bones in the sophomore’s ankle, but if he is unable to play, senior Mitch Mustain will make his first career start for USC. Mustain completed eight of 17 passes for 60 yards after taking over for Barkley in the second half of the loss to the Beavers.
Tyler was also hobbled by a sprained left ankle, re-aggravating an injury that has bothered the redshirt junior for most of the season. He ran for 34 yards on 11 carries before giving way to senior tailback C.J. Gable, who gave the Trojans’ running game a spark by carrying the ball 10 times for 57 yards and USC’s only touchdown of the game.
Galippo was also injured in the first half; the redshirt junior suffered a concussion in the first quarter and didn’t return to the game.
“I couldn’t see for a good five or 10 minutes,” said Gallipo, who had been starting his third consecutive game at middle linebacker since losing his starting job in the offseason to sophomore Devon Kennard. “I started feeling a little nauseous and threw up a little bit and couldn’t come back.”
Kennard, a former defensive end, replaced Gallipo and recorded eight tackles in the losing effort.

Disney’s 70-year love affair with fairy tales is about to come to a screeching halt.
The company’s latest film, Tangled — a modern twist on the classic story of Rapunzel — is set to open in theaters on Wednesday. But according to Pixar Animation Studios chief Ed Catmull, it will be Disney’s last fairy tale-themed film for the projected future.
“Films and genres do run a course,”  Catmull, who oversees Disney Animation along with director John Lasseter, told the Los Angeles Times. “They may come back later because someone has a fresh take on it … but we don’t have any other musicals or fairy tales lined up.”
Disney is known for making fairy tales popular, beginning with Snow White in 1937. Though princesses have usually packed a profitable punch for the company, the last fairy tale-themed film, 2009’s The Princess and the Frog, was “the most poorly performing of Disney’s recent fairy tales,” according to the Times.
In hopes of appealing to a broader audience, the studio is now looking to expand its horizons and come up with movies that can compete with the action films that seem to mesmerize younger moviegoers these days.
However, Disney movies sans princesses and happily ever afters sounds more like a sick joke and a complete paradox than anything else. Only time will tell how long the company can last without retreating to its traditional fairy tale-style films — but for now, it seems we are living on the brink of a redefinition of old school Disney.

A recent study conducted by UCLA professors found that many students struggle with their religious beliefs and identity throughout their college years.
Beginning in 2003, the study surveyed 112,000 college freshmen across the country, and then did a follow up study with 14,000 of those students after they had completed their junior year.
The study also found that the students chose not to focus on practicing the traditions of organized religion, but instead became more “spiritual.” The researchers defined this as asking existential questions, helping to improve the surrounding community and showing empathy toward others.
Researchers discovered that students who were more spiritual had stronger academic performance and leadership abilities, and were generally more satisfied with college life.
Reverend Jim Burklo, associate dean of the Office of Religious Life at USC, said that his experience working on a college campus is similar to the findings of this study.
“The job of higher education is to activate the imagination,” Burklo told the Los Angeles Times. “The moral imagination is a part of that.”
