Who would’ve thought that the United States, let alone the entire world, would be where it is now? What was only a blip on many Americans’ radars a month ago is now the largest pandemic in recent history, halting school, work and the topic of my column, the Olympics. 
I, like many of you, felt considerably dejected when I heard the news that the 2020 Summer Olympics would be officially postponed. Though it was the right decision, I can’t help but feel a sense of longing for one of my favorite sporting events in the world.
So, in the interest of providing some much needed nostalgic relief, here are my personal top three Olympic moments from my lifetime. 
Usain Bolt dominates at Beijing 2008 
In what would be the beginning of one of the most successful eras for any Olympic athlete, Jamaican sprinter Usain Bolt came into the Beijing 2008 Olympics with hopes of establishing himself as the fastest man in the world.
And in fact, he did just that, winning three gold medals in the process and breaking the world record in the 100-meter, 200-meter and 4×100-meter relay. Take that all in for a second.  
What sticks out to me even more about Bolt’s 100-meter run is that it was one of the first sporting events I ever watched. Before the 2008 Olympics, I didn’t care much about sports, but my dad insisted that I watch the race. I distinctly remember Bolt crossing the finish line and feeling a rush of excitement I had never felt before.
Bolt ended his career with eight gold medals and swept through the competition again at the 2012 and 2016 Olympics. His performance in 2008 introduced him to the world and brought track and field a level of attention it hadn’t seen in a long time. 
Michael Phelps finishes his star-studded career at Rio 2016 
There is never a dull moment when watching Michael Phelps. Phelps entered the 2016 Summer Olympics after having competed in every iteration of the games since 2000 — when he was only 15 — winning 22 Olympic medals and shattering dozens of world records in the process. 
Phelps qualified for six events and ended up with five gold medals as a 31-year-old in 2016. This surprised absolutely no one, but the near-superhuman performance Phelps put forth, showing zero sign of physical regression after nearly two decades of competition, was a feat that won’t likely be seen again for a long time. 
North and South Korea march together — several times
This is the only event on the list that isn’t a jaw-dropping athletic feat, but it’s here for good reason. 
Since North and South Korea split in 1948, the animosity between the two nations and horrific ramification of the split have been well documented. For 70 years, the North and South traded threats and assassination attempts while simultaneously trying to emerge from extreme poverty. 
However, for one fleeting moment, this changed when the North and South Korean teams marched together waving a Korean unification flag at the 2000 Summer Olympics. The two teams still competed separately, but the move represented a gesture for unity and peace that Koreans had not seen for over half a century. 
I was too young to witness this moment, but I have seen its follow-up acts. At the 2018 Winter Olympics, the North and South marched together again, bringing tensions over North Korea’s nuclear program to a temporary simmer. 
As someone of Korean descent, I found this moment especially moving. I finally could begin to relate to my great-grandmother, who used to tell me stories about escaping North Korea during the Korean War. I could finally see how powerful and meaningful the prospect of unification was. 
Rewatching both countries march into Pyeongchang Olympic Stadium together gave me a sense of hope this past week, and given the times we live in now, it was greatly needed.

I do not like pre-health students. No worries though, I can say that: I am a pre-health student. 
At this point in time, the hypercompetitive, cutthroat culture among pre-health students is an intercollegiate trope. I remember the time a classmate’s sample was stolen from the oven during an organic chemistry laboratory practical. I know students who refuse to participate in study groups because they avow that helping other students may lower the curve and affect their chances at earning a good grade. I breathed a sigh of relief when other students in my neurobiology class had another exam on the same day as our midterm. 
“This will lower the average, and that will be good for me,” I thought, succumbing to the merciless culture. Yet, believe it or not, USC’s pre-health environment is rumored to be on the less extreme end compared to other undergraduate institutions, such as Harvard and Johns Hopkins universities. 
In a sense, this hypercompetitiveness is warranted, with the increasingly demanding and ruthless admissions standards for medical schools. For perspective, USC’s Keck School of Medicine received about 8,261 applications in its 2017 admissions cycle. Out of these applicants, 186 were accepted — a 2.3% acceptance rate. Other top M.D. programs follow the same pattern, with universities such as Harvard, Johns Hopkins, Stanford and Columbia all having acceptance rates under 5%. 
Looking further at statistics, the average GPA for admits to Keck’s Class of 2023 was a 3.7, while the median MCAT score among admits was a 517 out of 528. Nationally, the mean and median MCAT score among test takers is a 500.  
It is understandable why these statistics make students stress and obsess over their cellular biology grade and organic chemistry lecture curve. However, this hypercompetitive nature is ultimately detrimental to the process of cultivating compassionate physicians. 
When nearly all emphasis in gaining admissions to medical school is placed on a letter grade and test score, toxicity flows rampantly. In a 2017 Kaplan Test Prep Survey among MCAT students, 86% of prospective M.D. students believe pre-health academic culture is “too competitive,” with 19% of respondents claiming they or other students they know have been bullied in a pre-health academic setting. Students also recall other pre-health students who have offered incorrect study guides in efforts to sabotage other students to raise the academic grading curve in their classes. 
Naturally, this lack of empathy seeps from undergraduate programs into M.D. programs. I have seen Twitter advertisements from medical school students offering consulting services to prospective undergraduate students for hundreds of dollars instead of just offering advice for free. Researchers at Yale University published a study in “JAMA Internal Medicine” that postulated higher rates of discrimination among minority medical school students compared to their peers.
While other factors may certainly contribute to this mistreatment, these patterns of apathy in the medical school setting follow a paradox; these environments are expected to educate physicians capable of building trust with their patients. If this is the kind of paradigm conspiring from the current medical school system, what does this say about the values of aspiring physicians? Do students truly want to help people and improve the field of medicine, or do some students’ motives stop short at the occupation’s prestige and high median salary? 
To counter the counterintuitive setting of pre-health academic culture, students must start by expanding their perspectives beyond their letter grades. Trust me — I want to do well in my classes and earn a GPA that will make me a competitive applicant for medical schools, too. Yet, dishonorable approaches to success and poor character ultimately negate the integrity in earning a high GPA, supposedly a predictor of success. Tangentially, cutthroat culture is a form of academic dishonesty. 
Moreover, perhaps students should take more pride in other classes that can prove conducive to becoming a physician, such as “Sociology, Demography and Health,” a sociology lecture centered around discussing the role of social inequities in healthcare. More students should adapt a sportsmanlike approach to classes and build each other up instead of sabotaging each other. At the end of the day, an attitude based on compassion will be more advantageous — not just to an aspiring physician but to their peers and the entire field of medicine.  
After all, we are all in this together, right?

Social distancing. Self-quarantines. Lockdowns. There has never been a more uprooting period of isolation and nothingness. This lifestyle, of course, is a sharp contrast to the average busy college student. For USC students used to tight schedules with classes, club meetings, endless library hours and socially packed weekends, this is foreign territory. With the arrival of the current pandemic, many have been thrust into a situation where their schedule may be clear, but they are still expected to maintain a level of productivity for classes and extracurriculars while also finding ways to fill those now-free gaps.
For many, though, these are stressful and anxiety-inducing times that aren’t optimal for productivity. Students have had to return to homes where they may not have an environment, let alone the resources, for success. They may need to lend a hand around the house if parents are still required to work, or they may even work themselves to help out. Regardless of the reason, USC students should take advantage of the pass/no pass or no record policy to alleviate anxieties if they need to — without feeling guilty. 
With social media use heightening as students quarantine, there are constant updates on what everyone else is doing. Push-up challenges, creative projects, workout videos and more — there is endless insight into exactly how others are passing time. For those who don’t or can’t thrive during upsetting circumstances such as a global pandemic, this exposure may create or reinforce unnecessary guilt.
The coronavirus crisis should put things into perspective. It has made health a top priority, and rightfully so. Instead of sustaining their usual busy schedules, students should take this time to take care of themselves in whatever form helps them and prioritize what’s important for them. Whether this is through using USC’s helpful new grading policies, spending time with family, making TikTok videos or doing absolutely nothing, it doesn’t matter and it doesn’t have to be productive. 
This goes for those who are continuing to find new ways to be constructive with their newly acquired free time. This is not a waste — if homemade workout routines and passion projects help students, then they should continue to do them. If students can use focusing on academics as a way to create needed order in their home lives, then, by all means, they should do this. The point is simply that there should be no guilt or judgment associated with how people choose to spend their time, especially during a pandemic. 
Students are constantly expected to work toward a goal. School is often prioritized above health, both mental and physical. This constant self-improvement mentality has been drilled into us. As this virus entirely uproots this outlook and puts the world on pause, students who can should see this as a break. 
It might even help provide some much-needed change in the way productivity and success are viewed on college campuses. But for now, everyone should stay healthy, do whatever it is they need to take care of themselves and, above all else, not feel guilty if that entails doing absolutely nothing.

Quarantining and social distancing in response to the coronavirus have forced jobs revolving around live events to come to a standstill. In turn, artists and those working in the live music industry are struggling financially. 
A piece published in Pitchfork, an online music magazine, offers suggestions on where people can donate money to help out musicians and independent record shops, as well as where musicians can apply for relief funding. If you have the ability, check out the Pitchfork piece and donate to any of the different funds for those working in the music industry.
With this in mind, local and less mainstream musicians often have even less access to capital than artists who are known far and wide; now is the time to show your dedication to them. Here’s how to support local artists during the pandemic.
For all you stereotypically indie kids out there, Bandcamp is familiar territory. For those just joining the party, the website is dedicated to ensuring independent artists and record labels maximize how much money they make from publishing to online streaming platforms. Browsing Bandcamp can also introduce you to many niche, underground artists. 
If you want to support those near you — either around USC or in your hometown — Bandcamp makes it incredibly easy to find artists with a geographically-based search through their Discover feature. 
When you find an artist you like, buy music from them on Bandcamp! Artists on the website receive 80 to 85% of your money when you purchase any of their music or merchandise — far more than what they would earn if you simply streamed their music. Fun fact: At the beginning of the coronavirus pandemic, Bandcamp completely waived the company’s revenue share of any sales made during a 24-hour period. Users purchased $4.3 million worth of music and merch that day!
Related to my point above, one can simply buy music from artists! Musicians earn fractions of pennies when fans stream their music. Don’t stop streaming, but if you want to make sure that your favorite artists’ careers can last beyond the pandemic, purchase EPs, albums and singles you love. Beyond Bandcamp, you could be old-fashioned and buy music on iTunes, Amazon Music and Google Play.
If you listen to vinyl, CDs or cassettes, keep ordering those online too. Some independent record stores are still selling and shipping products, so buy from your local record shops to support the underdogs twofold. To buy from your fellow Angelenos, check out Jacknife Records & Tapes (@jackniferecordsandtapes) and Stellar Remnant (@stellarremnant) on Instagram.
Missing concerts while stuck inside? Me too. To solve this issue, I have been watching festivals and individual artists live stream performances. To really set the mood, I turn on my string lights or colorful LEDs while watching NPR’s Tiny Desk (Home) Concerts and electronic festivals like Digital Mirage and JAM.
Although I mostly watch these streams to keep myself entertained, artists garner support from them, too. Lunar Hand, glass beach and POLARTROPICA are a few of my favorite SoCal artists who have been hosting music streams. Check them out when you’re tired of scrolling through Twitter … again.
In addition, NPR curated “A List Of Live Virtual Concerts To Watch During The Coronavirus Shutdown” and the site Stay At Home Festival includes a calendar of online music events happening during the pandemic. Take a look and see if they include artists you love.
Word of mouth is one of the easiest, cheapest ways to support smaller artists. Share their songs on your Instagram stories, text your family group chat with music recommendations or make your friends playlists featuring your favorite local artists. Who knows, they might start financially supporting them during this difficult time, too.
Here’s a playlist I made that includes local Los Angeles and USC artists that might chill you out amid the stresses of quarantining.

Remi Wolf’s new single is a successful addition to a movement seeking to reinvent pop music; “Woo!” makes a bold musical statement without sacrificing any of the artist’s authenticity.
The song kicks off with an understated keyboard sequence and a steady percussion base, complementing one another perfectly on the track. 
The engineering feels simple, but as the melody builds, it becomes clear that there is a vision behind “Woo!” –– one more chaotic and vibrant than originally anticipated, one that screams “Neo-Pop.”
The 24-year-old Bay Area native’s new single premiered Wednesday morning on Zane Lowe’s Beats 1 show and is her first of 2020. The release of the track follows her 2019 debut EP,  “You’re A Dog!” and sold-out tours with Cautious Clay and Still Woozy. 
Wolf, a Thornton School of Music alumna, had a brief stint on American Idol in 2014 before gaining recognition in the Los Angeles music scene, where she has garnered praise from notable publications including NPR, Billboard, Lyrical Lemonade and Paper Magazine. 
Her musical style evokes the grooviness of the Jackson 5 and the whimsicality of the Tom Tom Club, but even then, Remi’s brand of modern pop remains unique and innovative. 
The words that come to mind upon a first listen of “Woo!,” a playful, flighty track about love, were “chill,” “techno-inspired,” “funky” and “bright.” It seems that Wolf is painting a picture of what it is like to be young and in love —  in love with both a significant other and with all the life there is left to live. Her disjointed yet emotionally charged lyrics are emblematic of the passion and chaos that characterize being in your twenties: “And I don’t know what I really wanted / And fuck, I think I lost my wallet.”
That is not to say that the single is void of overarching themes or a cohesive narrative. “Woo!” tells a story about the fickleness and brazen fun of young love in all its forms: “Love: It’s not the answer, it’s the mindset / The question is not about who, it’s how you find it.” Lines like these are bound to resonate with young adults trying to figure out how to navigate the world and relationships, trying to understand what to feel and when to feel it. Without ever explicitly saying it, “Woo!” is about growing up and learning about yourself and others as you go.
A balance between premeditated, profound lyricism and the curation of a specific vibe is delicately struck. What really brings the track home are the sudden yet somehow smooth transitions between the relaxed, percussion-backed verses and the Lana Del Rey-esque chorus that gives Wolf a chance to show off her range.
The music video of “Woo!” takes place in a kaleidoscopic, psychedelic candyland and features a handful of Remi Wolf clones. The colors and visuals feel oddly reminiscent of Katy Perry’s “California Gurls” music video but messier and more relatable, as if the director said, “think early 2000s pop, but more girl-next-door-who-drops-acid-on-the-weekends.” In fact, it seems that Wolf’s specific brand delves into influences and inspirations from all things pop culture but as viewed through the lens of a generation brought up on internet subcultures.
“Woo!” lends itself to a number of interpretations, but above all, it is Remi Wolf’s claim to changing the pop game. The pop landscape is redefining itself as we speak, and the emerging pop artists of 2020 have a stake in that rebrand. Lady Gaga did it in her day and artists such as Dua Lipa are having a go at it now. With “Woo!,” Remi Wolf is marking her territory as a pop music innovator, and she has set the bar high for future tracks.

USC will extend paid administrative leave through May 13 for University staff facing cut hours or who are unable to work from home, according to a communitywide email sent by Senior Vice President of Human Resources Felicia Washington Wednesday. This is a one-month extension from USC’s previous announcement in late March that said paid leave would last through April 12.
“We continue to be grateful to our staff, faculty, healthcare workers, and students for all you’re doing to keep USC and our community strong during this unprecedented time,” the email read. “We are thinking of all of you and hope you and your families are safe and healthy.”
USC noted that there are specific stipulations in place for Keck Medicine employees’ use of paid administrative leave but has not yet made these requirements clear.
Nonmedical essential workers will receive face coverings in accordance with new guidelines from Los Angeles County and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which recommend wearing a clean face covering when in the presence of people outside one’s household. The announcement follows an executive order from L.A. Mayor Eric Garcetti Tuesday mandating that employees and patrons at essential businesses wear face coverings beginning Friday.
Other accommodations for employees include extending the deadline to request reimbursements from flexible spending accounts to pay for health care costs not covered by insurance from March 30 to May 1. Staff members can also take out loans and access funds from their retirement plans with no penalty.
Child care services at both the University Park and Health Sciences campuses will remain open, and families no longer requiring child care will not be charged tuition, the email stated. The child care centers have implemented social distancing and enhanced cleaning protocols.
The University has also suspended staff pay deductions for parking permits for the months of April and May, and both employees and students will receive parking permit refunds prorated from March 16. Neither employees nor students need to take action to receive reimbursements. Employees working at UPC will not be charged to use any of the campus parking structures. Staff no longer using their subsidized transit passes can contact USC Transportation to cancel payments beginning in May.
“We value each one of you, and we miss seeing you in person,” the email read. “It is our hope that we will soon be back on campus together, a stronger and more cohesive team that has overcome the unimaginable.”
Staff are encouraged to browse the frequently asked questions page for employees on the USC’s coronavirus website or to reach out to Washington or human resources partners directly with any concerns.

Even during the coronavirus pandemic, the 2020 Census is moving forward.
For most college students, this marks the first census they will have to fill out under their own “household,” an exciting step in their adulthood. 
Luckily for our tech-savvy generation which hasn’t posted mail since writing to pen pals in elementary school, the United States is now offering an online questionnaire for the first time in its history in addition to its usual telephone and mail-in options. Yes, even the Census Bureau has joined the virtual hysteria (though the new online option has long been in planning). 
All individuals living in the United States, regardless of their citizenship status, are required to answer the census. While many are unaware, this applies to international students, too — anyone who lives in the United States, even temporarily, is counted as a part of the U.S. population. 
The only exceptions are students from other countries who’ve returned home before the April 1 marker, who otherwise would have had to complete the census without the coronavirus’ interruption to the semester. 
Getting a precise count of college students proves nearly impossible. Because many students don’t know they’re required to fill out the census or are double-counted under their parents’ responses, the accuracy in counting university students severely drops. 
The official date for the census is April 1 — no, this isn’t the deadline to complete the census, so you’re not off the hook. Due to the volume of people entering and leaving the country on a daily basis, the Census Bureau determined April 1 would act as the placeholder for census responses. So ask yourself, “Where was I on April 1?” and answer the census accordingly. 
But why do I need to fill out the census? It’s required by Article 1, Section 2 of the Constitution. Still don’t care? The United States uses its census, conducted every decade, to allocate the number of seats each state receives in the House of Representatives until the next census. It’s a very, very big deal, if you care about your state’s representation. 
Census data is also used to direct federal funding for each state, affecting states’ spending on education, infrastructure, salaries for policemen and firefighters and other government-funded programs. With fewer people completing the census, states may receive less funding than they normally would as the entire state’s population isn’t accounted for.
“A lot of people think [they] don’t use any services the government provides,” said Eimmy Solis, a USC social sciences data librarian. “But if you drive your car around USC, you’re using roads that are paid by funding from the government.”
USC’s emergency services are in part funded by the U.S. Census, according to Solis.
The census asks questions related to age, race and housing — most of which your last Postmates driver already knows. The census takes approximately 10 minutes to complete and is entirely confidential (as mandated by Title 13 of the U.S. Code), making it the easiest test you will take in college.
For undocumented students who are afraid of completing the census, there’s no reason to worry. The census will no longer ask any questions related to citizenship status after the Supreme Court blocked President Donald Trump’s attempt to append the question.
“People who are undocumented shouldn’t fear that their information will be used against them,” Solis said. “The consequences of not filling out the census is a lot higher.” 
While households that fail to respond by mid-April will be mailed a printed questionnaire, the notorious census enumerators who come knocking on doors may not arrive until later due to the coronavirus. 
USC Housing is working with the Census Bureau to coordinate responses for students who lived in campus residences this semester. Since there are hundreds of on-campus students living at the same addresses, USC Housing will directly provide census data to the bureau and save students living in dormitories from answering the census themselves. Students who live off campus are still expected to complete the census the same as nonstudents. 
The Von KleinSmid Center Library had planned to host a census kiosk open to the general public until Los Angeles County shut down all census kiosks in March because of social distancing measures.
Los Angeles County has historically faced issues with undercounting its population, partially due to its population size, language barriers and escalating homelessness crisis.
“L.A. County is the hardest to count county in the whole United States,” Solis said. “[There’s] a big fear that, again … California will also be undercounted.”
The Census Bureau classified eight out of 15 Los Angeles Council Districts as having “high” or “very high” rates of low responses, according to a Los Angeles City census report. 
University Park — the neighborhood surrounding USC — was one of many L.A. County neighborhoods with high rates of undercounting along with West Adams, Koreatown and Pico-Union. As a part of Council District 9, University Park has a lower median household income and lower percentage of highschool graduates than the city’s average, key indicators of what the Census Bureau classified as “hard-to-count populations.”
As census data is used to determine Congressional seats for the next 10 years, undercounting poses an even greater problem for states with large populations. 
“California missed having an additional representative in Congress because it’s estimated about 13,000 people in 2010 didn’t fill out the [last] census,” Solis said. “That’s a big deal.” 
To put the number into context, Delaware, Montana, Alaska, Wyoming, Vermont, North Dakota and South Dakota each have one seat in the House. 
California currently has 53 seats, more than any other state. However, California also suffers the most from undercounting, making the number of seats it has an inaccurate representation leading to the state receiving less funding per capita than other states.
Solis reminded students the Census Bureau only contacts individuals by mail, phone or in-person, so any emails that appear to be from the bureau are likely a scam. The Federal Trade Commission also warned people to avoid any inquiry about social security numbers, banking information or political affiliations.

Once swarming with students lounging on sun-soaked couches, stumbling out of Trader Joe’s laden with groceries and lining up for midday caffeine fixes, USC Village now stands empty, with the exception of a few mask-donning patrons scurrying to buy essential goods. With classes moved online and campus now deserted, many businesses have been forced to close temporarily or cut their operations drastically. 
Of the 33 retailers in USC Village, only 14 remain open. Those that remain open have reduced hours, enacted safety precautions and cut down on employees to accomodate for reduced foot traffic, some manning their businesses with one- or two-person crews. All restaurants have suspended dine-in options, limiting orders to takeout or delivery. 
“USC Village is here to serve our neighbors during this unprecedented crisis and will remain a resource to the public,” the USC Village website states. “For your safety and the safety of others, tenants at USC Village enforce social distancing measures, including separation of individuals by at least six feet and staggered entrance to limit the numbers indoors.”
To maintain social distancing, Dulce Cafe set up a table in front of its shop to limit customer-employee interactions and possible contamination within the restaurant.
“It kind of feels like a lemonade stand in a way,” manager Allen Mariano said. “It’s difficult trying to create a sense of welcoming.”
While Dulce has not had to lay off employees, uncertainty over the length and severity of the coronavirus crisis presents an ever-looming stressor for management.
“I’m not even the owner, but I definitely take ownership because this place definitely grows on you and it definitely feels like family,” Mariano said. “Of course, I worry about everyone who has to pay rent and has to put food on the table, and I think that’s the biggest element of stress I have: making sure everyone’s taken care of.”
Some businesses, however, have reduced the number of employees working in their stores. Without the need for waiters to serve dine-in customers, some restaurants, like Kobunga Korean Grill, only have two employees working at a time, with one person taking orders and the other preparing food in the back.
Many others, like Wahlburgers and Greenleaf Gourmet Chopshop, have had to close their doors until students return to campus. Citing loss of revenue, the USC Village Wahlburgers closed indefinitely Tuesday with employees expected to be rehired once ot reopens, according to Wahlburgers general manager Brandon Sharpe. Twenty-five hourly employees from the USC Village branch of Greenleaf have been temporarily laid off, and 11 managers from both the USC and Hollywood branches have relocated to the three stores that remain open.
“Unfortunately, we don’t have as much — almost zero — in-house sales, so all of our sales have to come through takeout or delivery or catering,” said Will Hotchstatter, a manager at USC Village Greenleaf. “Recently we’ve been doing catering for the Children’s Hospital in Hollywood. So, that has been taking up a lot of our sales as well as just making sure that we’re able to give back to the nurses and doctors and everyone who has been working so hard toward helping the community.”
With Gov. Gavin Newsom’s implementation of the statewide stay-at-home order March 19, other businesses have seen a shift in their primary source of income as consumers search for new ways to occupy their time.
“We’ve been selling a lot more bikes and doing a lot less repairs,” said Johnny Oball, head of service and retail for Solé Bicycles. “We do a lot of direct-to-consumer sales online, and we’ve seen a tremendous increase of online sales. We’ve been doing really, really, really well online and kind of just breaking even in store, so it’s a little different with us because we are still essential being a bike shop, and cycling [is] still an essential activity.”
As service-based retailers see a drastic reduction of patronage, many small businesses worry about their long-term survival. Emily Garber, the owner of Apple Doc, the Mac repair clinic in USC Village, said that traffic has been reduced to less than a quarter of their normal level.
“It is a struggle to make payroll and pay for parts,” Garber said. “We’re in this time where there’s not much support for business owners. There’s just a level of uncertainty and [we’re] just doing our best to stay strong and make it through this time and support our customers.”
Brian Wilson, the executive director of real estate development and leasing at USC, said he was encouraged that select businesses have been able to continue serving the community and providing a source of income for their employees in an email statement to the Daily Trojan.
“Like other landlords in Los Angeles and around the country, USC is evaluating each tenant based on its circumstances and will make a determination about how to respond on that basis,” Wilson wrote. “We have been communicating with our tenants and have identified resources available for them to support their businesses.”
Garber said she has not received clear directions from the University on how it will support her business and hopes USC will communicate a plan soon. She worries that with no end to the coronavirus pandemic in sight, many small businesses will have to permanently shut their doors. 
“All of us in the Village invested a lot, a lot of time and money creating our business, because we were given an empty spot, basically, when we moved in, and we built what we have,” Garber said. “So all of us … want to make it work, and work with University to help us all stay viable … A lot of us here really want to be a part of USC for the long term.”

Undergraduate Student Government President Truman Fritz, Vice President Rose Ritch and the 140th Student Senate were inaugurated for the 2020-21 school year at the Senate meeting Tuesday. 
The inauguration ceremony was held over Zoom and was attended by around 70 people, including President Carol Folt. According to Fritz, Folt was the first University president to attend a USG inauguration ceremony. The ceremony was also broadcasted live on the USG Facebook page. 
Fritz gave an inaugural speech in which he reflected on the efforts of USG throughout the past year, especially in continuing operations and working on projecting through the unforeseen challenges caused by the coronavirus. 
“As we meet tonight, our university is experiencing an event unlike any other,” Fritz said. “I know many members of our community … face great uncertainty about the months ahead. To the members of our student body, we must offer ourselves and our resources as a source of unwavering support, wherever we can provide it … We can and we will work together through spirited teamwork and steadfast action to accomplish not only the improbable, but the impossible.” 
Fritz said his mission is to prioritize students’ mental and physical health and their basic needs, create spaces for discussions of diversity and inclusion, hold administrators accountable to the promises they make to students and work to slow down the University’s environmental impact through divestment initiatives. He also hopes to lead USG in establishing working partnerships with other student organizations in order to expand their impact beyond just the organizations incorporated under USG. 
“USG must recognize that we need to expand our scope beyond our own organization,” Fritz said. “We will do this by building new partnerships, strengthening old ones and unifying student groups across USC through direct engagement. This year, we will lean into our devotion to making a difference and bring new and exciting ideas to the table by working with all stakeholders in our decision-making wherever we can.” 
Following the inauguration ceremony, the 140th USG Senate held its first meeting. Fritz announced his appointment of new officers for the cabinet, as well as for the legislative, programming and communications branches.
“Essentially, we had over a couple hundred applicants for our various different positions,” Fritz said. “I believe there were around 80 positions open this semester … We made our final decisions based on the calculated stipend amount that we were looking for in terms of hiring.” 
A resolution in support of incorporating the Native American Student Assembly was presented to the new Senate. 
“We have been working for a very long time towards becoming an assembly, so I’m very happy and very pleased to be presenting … not just for that consideration, but to also bring into light the challenges Native American students face at USC in general,” Native American Student Union President Maracea Chase said. 
A resolution supporting the implementation of a permanent resource center for undocumented students was also presented. Representatives from Improving Dreams, Education, Access and Success, a student organization that focuses on increasing awareness of undocumented student issues that affect USC and its surrounding community, spoke on the necessity of establishing the resource center. 
“There is an urgent need to establish a resource center that provides [immigration-related services], in addition to an appointed full-time [staff member],” IDEAS vice president Kimberly Alvarado said. “This pandemic has increased instability in the lives of the undocumented community … We are calling on USC to provide support for this underrepresented demographic.” 
The Senate will vote on the resolutions at the meeting next week.

When USC sent a communitywide email last month after outsiders hijacked two Zoom classes in the Dornsife College of Letters, Arts and Sciences and the Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism, faculty and students did not expect their virtual classes to continue being interrupted. 
But days later, a Zoom hacker impersonated Emad Askar, a junior majoring in public policy, during his “Public Policy and Law” class. Three hackers also entered Juliette Wimpfheimer’s “Principles of Microeconomics” class.
These are just two of several Zoombombings that have taken place after the University asked professors to enact security measures, such as logging in through a USC account and adding waiting rooms and passwords. Other universities, such as Arizona State University, have faced similar issues with Zoombombers gaining access to classes and causing disruption. In addition to its security issues, the company is also facing a lawsuit in California for sending data to Facebook without being transparent about it in its privacy policy. 
Fifteen minutes into the class, Askar heard a student briefly disrupt the class by murmuring a question. When the professor asked for the student to repeat the question, Askar was confused to hear that the professor was talking to him. Noticing that the hacker was using his name, Askar urged his professor to remove the individual from the classroom.  
After a back and forth with the hacker and attempting to convince the professor that he was the real student, Askar said the interloper eventually left but not before insulting him. 
Following the first Zoombombing disturbances, USC condemned the interruptions and assured new Zoom safeguards in a Universitywide email from President Carol Folt and Provost Charles Zukoski sent March 24.
“Students will be contacted by their instructors with new protocols to prevent this type of disruption and disturbance while attending classes online,” the email read. “We will be vigilant in determining who was responsible for these actions, and we are doing everything in our power to stop it right away.”
In response to the interruptions, the University enacted additional security measures for Zoom calls, such as having professors provide a password with the class meeting link or use the waiting room feature and approve each student to join the class.
“The measures that we have taken to require authenticating in with your USC credentials eliminate the vast majority of the opportunities for Zoombombing,” Chief Information Officer Douglas Shook wrote in an email to the Daily Trojan. “We are encouraging instructors to be very judicious regarding admitting anyone from the waiting room unless they have invited guests to class.”
Wimpfheimer, another student who witnessed a Zoombombing incident, said her Latinx classmate was targeted by three Zoom perpetrators, who directed slurs at them. The hackers also used slurs aimed at the LGBTQ community, played pornographic audio and seemed to be playing video games in the background. 
After continued interruptions, the teaching assistant for Wimpfheimer’s class eventually removed the hackers from the class, although it took a while to do so, Wimpfheimer said. 
Robert Dekle, Wimpfheimer’s “Principles of Microeconomics” professor, said he believes this experience made the University, faculty and students aware that the platform can be easily hacked and has thus led to stricter security measures. However, he advised everyone — including students, faculty and the University — to be vigilant to prevent future Zoombombings.
“Professors should do his or her best to make sure that the class is secure, and also the University and also the company,” Dekle said. “If it is password protected, [students] shouldn’t give away passwords to friends or they shouldn’t email the link to friends or their acquaintances. They need to take ownership, too, of maintaining security — it’s not just their issue, but it’s the issue for the common good of everyone taking the class.” 
Dekle said that while the new measures would shorten class time, the enhanced security was worth the tradeoff. 
“Many students don’t come in through the USC [email system] — they’re in the waiting room, so it’s going to take time for the TA to go over one by one,” Dekle said. “It might slow the opening of the class a little bit, but security is important.”
Though Askar was initially unbothered by the Zoom interrupter using his name, he later became concerned about whether the hacker had access to his private information, especially with recent concerns regarding Zoom’s privacy policy among the public. 
“I started thinking ‘How did they know? Are they going to follow me into other classes? … Do they have private information about me?’” Askar said. “That’s my primary worry, as well as Zoom itself having an incredible amount of access to our private information … I just think we kind of rushed to using this service without really knowing the capabilities and the faults of it.”
The New York City Department of Education banned the use of Zoom for its classes Friday due to concerns about the platform’s security, citing instances of Zoombombing at K-12 schools. The decision followed an FBI warning last week regarding the influx of interlopers on the video-teleconferencing platform. Privacy concerns with the program also include Zoom sharing data to Facebook even of those who are not users of the social media platform, NPR reported. Additionally, flaws in Zoom’s software enable hackers to access a user’s webcam or microphone. According to the company, these issues have since been resolved. 
USC plans to continue to use Zoom for remote classes, Shook confirmed in a statement to the Daily Trojan, and is confident in the platform’s use for virtual instruction but expects Zoom to enhance security measures. 
Askar said that while Zoom might work in the short term, he thinks USC should find a more secure and reliable platform to use should classes remain remote through the fall.
“It’s going to get way worse before it gets better,” Askar said. “It would be very irresponsible for the school to just assume we’re going to have [in-person] fall classes and that ‘Oh, we can just go another month with Zoom, we’ll survive, we’ll kind of straggle along, limp to the finish line.’”
After the class interruptions, USC added a page about Zoombombing to its course continuity website, recommending students who have encountered attacks targeting protected groups report the incident to the Title IX Office. Staff and faculty who experience an attack against a protected class can notify the Office of Equity and Diversity.

When John Tanner first got to USC, he was against all forms of dancing. Training in Taekwondo since he was five, Tanner saw dancing as more of a workout rather than a community he could belong in. 
It wasn’t until his friend took him to a salsa night his freshman year that Tanner, now a senior majoring in computer science and business administration, fell in love with Latin dance — all thanks to Break On 2, USC’s premier Latin Fusion dance team. 
Break On 2 has two divisions: a performance team and a club annex. Although students are required to audition in order to join the team, anyone is welcomed to join the club annex.
Neha Patel, a senior majoring in business administration, joined the club without any formal training in dance. After one semester of being a part of the club annex, she successfully tried out for the performance team.
“[The club annex] is a relaxed, casual environment where there’s no pressure about being good at salsa or knowing the technicalities behind it,” Patel said. “You kind of just show up and it’s just there for fun.” 
Break On 2 teaches students basic dance steps at its monthly salsa nights in Mudd Hall. The team clears out the chairs in the room, leaving its marble floor ready to use. Dancers enter and soon enough the space is converted from a dull classroom to a buzzing dance studio. 
A typical salsa night starts around 8:30 or 9 p.m., when two team members lead everyone through fundamental steps, such as partner dancing. From there, a team member puts on a playlist and everyone in the room goes through various forms of Latin dancing — from salsa to bachata to samba — ensuring that there’s a style of dance that appeals to anyone who might be interested. 
“[The variety] attracts members who come from different backgrounds or who are curious about Latin dance or just dance in general,” said Natalie Balladarsch, a December 2019 graduate who majored in public relations. “It’s also cool to just fuse different cultures and different origins of dance and kind of understand the history and compare fundamentals.”
Apart from learning the steps to the dance, the club also focuses on teaching cultural context. During its bachata unit, Break On 2 teaches its members about the history of the Dominican Republic and Afro-Latinx people. For Alexandra Da Silva, a junior majoring in biomedical engineering, teaching the background is important so that members understand how these dances came to be and why they are mainstream today. 
Balladarsch joined Break On 2 to connect with her Colombian heritage. As a child, she danced ballet and competed in figure skating, but now wanted an opportunity to get back into dance. 
“I always kind of grew up with salsa loosely being a part of my family and my culture, but I never really formally learned the dance and the formal technique,” Balladarsch said. “I was always interested in learning more of the technical side of salsa. So I thought it would be like the perfect way to do that.”
Salsa nights have become a staple of Break On 2; it’s during these events that members create some of their favorite college memories. For Tanner, some of his most memorable experiences came from late-night runs to Spudnuts Donuts with team members after salsa night. 
“The only thing open is like every restaurant on Figueroa and pretty much half to the entire team, we all cram into Spudnuts and just snack after dancing for four to six hours and working the event,” Tanner said. “We’re all tired, we’re all sweaty, and nobody cares. It’s like a family event kind of thing.”
Da Silva recalls her interaction with a Department of Public Safety officer at a salsa night as one of her best experiences. After calling DPS to come unlock the room for set-up, an officer asked Da Silva what the event was. She told him she was a part of Break On 2, and to her surprise, the officer told her about the fun times he had at salsa night when he attended USC. 
Salsa nights and weekly practices lead up to Break On 2’s big performance showcase in the spring, when the team spends the entire day at Bovard Auditorium. Before the show begins and audience members fill up the auditorium, performers do lighting and technical rehearsals, ensuring every detail of the show is perfect. The showcase is about an hour and a half long with opening and closing numbers featuring everybody on the team. 
It’s the moments behind the stage, however, that they remember the most.
“You have like 70 or 80 people crammed into the back of Bovard and all of us are cheering each other on,” Da Silva said. “It’s all the work from the spring semester all culminated into this one event. So everybody is just in general really supportive of each other [and] all the work that everybody put in.”
The supportive nature of Break On 2 does not stop at its showcase. The entire organization is laid back and encouraging, allowing members to let go and be themselves, according to Da Silva.
“There’s a ton of different Latinx culture clubs, and there’s a ton of different dance clubs, but I think that our club specifically kind of bridges those two together in a judgment-free environment,” Da Silva said. 
The club has allowed students like Patel to grow more comfortable in their skin. Patel, who said she hadn’t been in touch with her creative side, found a new way to express herself outside of her Marshall bubble. 
“It’s really helped me be more confident in other aspects of my life,” Patel said. “I think being confident with dance and how you move in your body … definitely indirectly leads to having more confidence in public speaking or just going up to someone and talking to them or not being afraid to just let loose at times.”
Apart from dancing experience and newfound confidence, Break On 2 has provided its members with a tight-knit family. Every member cares for each other and dancing enables a special bond that cannot be easily replicated anywhere else. 
During their annual retreat at the beginning of fall semester, members of Break On 2 are able to bond with each other outside of dance practice. The retreat is a weekend-long, off-campus excursion where members play icebreakers to get to know each other better. These icebreakers typically involve physical touch, such as holding hands or carrying each other, so members become more comfortable with partner dancing. 
“It’s interesting getting over that hurdle so early and getting to know people because it allows you to become that much closer to everybody,” Da Silva said. 
The retreat also allows students to share more about their lives as they get to know both new and old members. 
“We do this thing where we go around in a circle, and we kind of share what dance means to us and why we joined and what our favorite thing about being on the team is,” Balladarsch said. “It’s just a really heartfelt moment where you get to see everyone’s passion for dancing really come through and [to] connect on that level.”
The friendships that team members have with each other go beyond dancing; Tanner said Break On 2 is a family of over 60 siblings who are willing to help each other at the drop of a dime. Tanner has had experiences with lending space in his home for members who needed a place to stay, and they have offered the same help in return. 
“It’d be like if my family called me up on the phone and said, ‘Hey, John, I need you right now,’” Tanner said. “I would drop everything I was doing for those people.”

It’s raining where I live. It’ll rain for the next several days according to the weather forecast. 
It’s like the sun has tired from shining so effortlessly, constantly sharing her warmth with us. I guess she, too, needs a break from the noisy world we live in. She probably knows just how much the trees and animals need water to thrive and grow. 
Looking out of my window, I hear the loud weeping of the rain and see the streets fill with her tears. They say your skin glows after you cry. So after the rain stops, maybe the outside world will radiate as the grass becomes greener and the animals come out to play. It just goes to show that even the weather has feelings. She, too, is going through this trying time with us. 
During this isolation period, everyone seems to be on their own journey of personal regrowth. While this is important, collective growth should not be forgotten. Though it’s easy to sink away from the busy world and desire to be alone, maintaining healthy social relationships remain just as important. Succumbing to loneliness and miscommunication creates a fragmented social world. The story of the Tyrone family in “Long Day’s Journey Into Night” is an exemplar of the ways we become victims to desolation. 
Written by American playwright Eugene O’Neill and published by his widow in 1956 — three years after his death — the play follows a day in the life of the Tyrone family, a once-close family of four whose bond has broken over the years for various reasons. From the mother Mary’s morphine addiction and the father James’ alcoholism to their two sons’ (Edmund and Jamie) growing alcoholism and lax attitude toward life, this story highlights the fall of something that was once great — a family who loved and cared for each other. What remains the greatest conflict in this play is the characters’ lack of meaningful communication despite their constant arguing. 
Unlike previous installments of this column where I applied life lessons from stories, I write this one in particular to do the opposite. Instead of mimicking the characters’ behavior of detachment, I warn you of the dangers of miscommunication and its powerful ability to cultivate toxic relationships. Given our current circumstance — whether you feel trapped in your childhood room with the chaos of your family or feel isolated in your own studio apartment — we can learn from the flaws of the Tyrone family. 
Longing to escape the all-consuming ties of his family, the younger son, Edmund, wanders the outdoors on a path near his house. In Act 4, Scene 1, he narrates his little excursion with a newfound epiphany regarding solitude. 
“The fog was where I wanted to be,” Edmund said. “I didn’t meet a soul. Everything looked and sounded unreal. Nothing was what it is. That’s what I wanted — to be alone with myself in another world where truth is untrue and life can hide from itself. Out beyond the harbor … I even lost the feeling of being on land … As if I had drowned long ago. As if I was the ghost belonging to the fog, and the fog was the ghost of the sea. It felt damned peaceful to be nothing more than a ghost within a ghost.”
Edmund’s walk through the fog serves as a healthier means of escapism than drinking away his feelings. And still, he does not communicate his deepest desires, wavering thoughts and contradictory feelings to his family. He longs to be a ghost and to live in a world where people can hide from their own reflections. 
His longing for extreme isolation is ironically something that today’s society involuntarily faces. Forced to shelter in place, the world is in a state of seclusion. Yet, what Edmund desperately wishes for is a reality most of us dread. His broken family drove him to the point of confinement. 
In contrast, I hope that during our own period of confinement we find solace and comfort with the people that surround us. Relying on our families and friends to help us through this dark time where change appears daunting, it’s this continuous communication that quenches our innate thirst for social interaction. 
By breaking the confinement of quarantine and taking a second to enjoy the company of others, we grant ourselves with the opportunity to deeply connect with people. Communicating and exchanging thoughts and feelings permits a needed emotional release from whatever stress bothers you.     
So, like the rain, remember it’s OK to cry sometimes. But at the same time, never forget to share your feelings with those around you. 
Trust me. Though your face may glow after the tears fall down from your cheeks, your heart will not. The real beauty comes when your soul shines from the love you receive by the ones you cherish the most.
