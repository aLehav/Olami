The Information Technology Program at the Viterbi School of Engineering launched a new minor in artificial intelligence application to reflect a rapidly changing AI industry. The minor opened to all students at the start of the Fall 2022 semester.
Noticing the great industry potential of artificial intelligence, professor of information technology practice and industrial and systems engineering practice Nitin Vasant Kale founded the minor program, which aims to educate students about AI, enhance their major studies and explore career opportunities.
“We think our students can use AI and apply AI in many industries, which we don’t even know today because this field is changing so fast,” Kale said. “[For instance, AI] could be used in the medical field, in predicting risk factors for certain diseases or the spread of viruses.”
The minor’s course plan was designed to educate students from various academic disciplines and backgrounds, Kale said. 
“We make [courses] very approachable to non-engineers and non-[computer science] students,” he said. “Those who don’t have several semesters of computer science can still pick up enough AI knowledge to go out in the real world, work for companies and solve real-world problems using AI.”
The program’s core requirements include intro-level classes like “Programming in Python,” “Introduction to Data Analytics” and “Basics of Artificial Intelligence,” which provide students with basic skills in creating artificial intelligence. A gateway course, “Applied Artificial Intelligence,” is offered to prospective students to interest them in the AI application minor.
“I highly recommend anybody who’s interested in the AI aspect to sign up for these courses. Something I really like about it is that it focuses on real-world experiences and application, so you are able to actually learn the things and apply them to real world situations like a working environment, and it prepares you really well,” said Kelly Gee, a junior majoring in intelligence and cyber operations who is planning to declare  a minor in AI applications.
One of the key reasons why she hopes to declare a minor in AI application, Gee said, was the potential to develop a career in AI.
“Right now, in the cyber field, I’m specifically interested in digital forensics,” Gee said. “There’s a lot of possibility with AI and cybersecurity because we could create different machine learning algorithms and things to actually speed up the process and possibly even automate the threat detection to make it faster for us to help prevent cybersecurity [issues].”
The program has elicited a great deal of attention since it was launched, with some students even lamenting the missed opportunity to declare the minor.
“I currently have the applied analytics minor. But, if I were a sophomore, [and] if I had the option to choose this minor, I would probably take this because it also covers ethics and is more focused on a specific field, which is AI. So I feel like its application prospect is much better than my current [minor],” said Greg Xu, a senior majoring in philosophy, politics and economics. 
There are currently seven students enrolled in the minor. Kale said he’s optimistic about the program’s prospects and ambitious about its development.
“My hope is that in this first academic year, we will get about 20 students, and then build up from there,” Kale said.

The Department of Public Safety found that aside from a few fluctuations, crime rates have generally remained at similar levels between 2019 and 2021, as written in its 2022 Annual Security and Fire Safety Report published Wednesday. The most common types of crime included were sexual assault crimes and motor vehicle theft, with most cases taking place on the University Park Campus.
The report, which aims to provide resources and reporting to enhance campus safety, is mandated by the Jeanne Clery Disclosure of Campus Security Policy and Campus Crime Statistics Act, which requires that colleges and universities disclose reports of crime on campus and the surrounding areas.
The report now includes incidents provided to DPS by the Los Angeles Police Department with the rest of the crime statistics, instead of displaying them as a separate category. 
The number of sexual assault cases in and around the University Park Campus — 78 in 2021, 45 in 2020 and 97 in 2019 — reported include instances related to the wrongdoings of George Tyndall, a former USC gynecologist who sexually abused thousands of patients at the Engemann Student Health Center.
Seven cases of rape and two of fondling related to Tyndall were reported in 2019. In 2020, 12 cases of rape and one of fondling were reported, and there was one report of fondling related to Tyndall in 2021. 
Though these cases occurred prior to Tyndall’s removal from practice in 2016, before the time frame of the report, they went unreported and were only uncovered with the 2018 investigation into Tyndall’s wrongdoings. The cases reported during the time frame of the 2022 report data were included to “represent the University’s good faith to classify and include all Clery-reportable incidents relating to Tyndall,” according to the report.
The report also noted that the decrease in liquor law violation instances from 2019 to 2020 does not reflect an actual decrease in underage alcohol consumption in University residence halls, which remains consistent with prior years. Rather, a clarification to the reporting guidelines means that the University no longer reports underage alcohol possession and consumption in private settings, such as residence halls, because it is not a violation of California state law. The University is working to correct previously misreported data.
In a University-wide email, the administration wrote that USC remains committed to the unifying values of integrity, excellence, well-being, open communication, accountability, diversity, equity and inclusion. The ASR, the administration wrote, aligns with USC’s commitment to provide “an environment where we each can thrive and explore all USC has to offer.”
The report opens with messages from President Carol Folt and DPS Interim Chief David Carlisle. It details safety resources on campus, procedures to raise awareness and addresses crime and fire reports from the last three years and University policies and educational programming on reports of prohibited conduct.
In her message, Folt praised the “resilience and nimbleness” of DPS, and highlighted how the department spearheaded a partnership with USC Street Medicine to provide first-responder care for people experiencing homelessness..
The report can be read online here. Paper copies of the report can be requested by contacting Associate Vice President for Clery Act Compliance and Youth Protection Gabe Gates.

After starting their Pac-12 play with a win over Stanford last week, No. 20 USC women’s soccer team is gearing up for a road trip this weekend to take on Oregon State Thursday evening and the University of Oregon on Sunday afternoon.
Almost halfway through the season, the Trojans boast a 5-1-1 record, including 4-1-1 in non-conference play. And, the Trojans believe that they are only going to get stronger as they enter the second half of the season, and double down on conference matches.
“We didn’t necessarily start off as strong as we wanted to leading up to Pac-12 play,” said senior goalkeeper Anna Smith.  “It’s a long season… You have to take it one game at a time. You have to take it one practice at a time in order to really be successful and really be able to last the full season.”
Going into Oregon State, the Trojans are looking to build on their 2-1 victory over Stanford, which included a season-high nine saves from Smith and a brace (2 goals) from senior defender Nicole Payne, who was named this week’s Pac-12 Women’s Soccer Offensive Player of the Week.
“In the first half, we obviously got scored on, and we knew we were going to have to come back and compete even harder in the second half,” Smith said about the win over Stanford. “Resetting during the second half and just coming out and not allowing any shots was our mentality. No shots, no goals.”
Now, the Trojans will look to capitalize on their strong defense to generate more offense against Oregon State on Thursday.
“It’s really important in the weeks leading up to games to focus on ourselves, and feeling really confident,” Smith said. “Getting good shots off, making sure we’re making hard runs, making sure we’re clean out of the back and through the middle, just kind of fine-tuning everything from the back to the front.”
The Trojans will look to get creative on offense in order to break through a tough Oregon State defense.
“At times, they have shown a back three that sometimes turns into a back five with lots of numbers in the box defensively,” Head Coach Jane Alukonis said. “Trying to make sure we figure out ways to create good opportunities for ourselves… Hopefully we will have success in the counterattack, trying to get at them before they can turn into a back five.”
The Trojans are also looking to get more goal scorers involved, after relying on Payne exclusively against Stanford. 
“We’ve been working a lot on combination play and how our attackers all work together,” Alukonis said. “It’s an easier finish in the end if you have multiple people working together, rather than relying on one person to try and create an opportunity for themselves.”
Beyond this weekend, the Trojans are looking to continue improving as they take on the remainder of the Pac-12 conference.
“Getting the win over Stanford was huge, and going into this weekend it’s super important that we build off of that energy,” Smith said. “Every game we play, we are going to have a target on our back, so it’s important to go into these games and take care of business on the road.”
Despite the looming battles, the Trojans are looking forward to pushing themselves.
“We are very well aware that our conference is amazing, so [there’s] no easy games,” Alukonis said. “Every game will be competitive, but we are just trying to do the very best we can over the next nine games and try to finish at the top of the conference.”

University members are working to spruce up a small plot of land near Shrine Auditorium, gathering weekly to garden and host wellness events through the University Park Peace Garden. Camille Dieterle, associate professor of clinical occupational therapy, leads the Garden Project, which is funded by the USC Chan School of Occupational Therapy ReSPONs grant.“I have had an interest in the intersection between environmental sustainability and wellness for a long time,” Dieterle said. “Most of my teaching and work is in the area of health and wellness.”
The positive effects of participating in outdoor activities — such as cognitive restoration and physical wellness — and the lack of outdoor activities in Los Angeles inspired Dieterle to begin the University Peace Garden Project.
“The neighborhood that our University is in does not have many outdoor spaces,” Dieterle said. “I wanted to create even more outdoor spaces… for the surrounding community.” 
The Garden Project began in March, when Dieterle and volunteers cleaned the space of trash and weeds, installed raised gardening beds and planted vegetables. In September, the Peace Garden began to host weekly open gardening hours and events, which will continue into the spring semester. Fall semester events span a variety of topics including sustainability, wellness and education. 
Dieterle said she intends to use the project to promote green space in urban settings, community health and sustainability education. University partners of the project include the Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion Department and USC Office of Sustainability. 
The Office of Sustainability assigned interns to work on the University Park Peace Garden Project through its President’s Sustainability Internship Program, which connects students with University sustainability initiatives. The Garden Project has also collaborated with the Sola Community Peace Center, an organization intended to develop peaceful education within the community. 
Mel Ayala, a junior majoring in public policy, is a gardening and event programming intern working with the Peace Garden. Ayala began working with the project because of her interest in sustainability and prior experience working in a community garden.  
“I like watching everything grow,” Ayala said. “It is a nice experience seeing things progress over time.”
Ayala also enjoys working with the project’s garden cat, Sunshine.
“Sustainability is for everyone…we have a responsibility,” Ayala said. “If we want a future [on Earth], it is important to take the necessary steps.”
Olivia Heffernan, a senior majoring in environmental studies, is also a Peace Garden intern. Heffernan’s role involved assisting with redesigning the space for community use. 
“I hope everyone has their own personal experience when visiting [the University Park Peace Garden], whether that is to relax, learn or [attend] a workshop,” Heffernan said.
An area of focus for the project is promoting the use of California native greenery — which is dwindling in population. Dieterle said it is important to use greenery native to the area because it adds biodiversity and may assist in water conservation.
“Environmental sustainability and human wellness are connected,” Dieterle said. “I am excited to see where [the project] goes.”

Four weeks into the 2022-23 college football season, 21 teams remain undefeated. Traditional football powerhouses such as the University of Alabama, Ohio State, University of Georgia, University of  Kansas and USC have led the way with  dominant victories and a few close scrapes. But one of these is not like the others. You may be thinking to yourself, “Did I fall asleep in August and wake up at the start of basketball season? Surely the Kansas football team isn’t undefeated, right? Not that Kansas?” Unbelievably, the Kansas Jayhawks remain undefeated in college football, alongside a couple of other sleeping giants with the Syracuse Orange and the Washington Huskies.
Syracuse Orange
Four Power-Five teams have messed around and found out what Head Coach Dino Babers is cooking up in upstate New York. A 31-7 shellacking of perennial enemies Louisville should’ve been a warning to University of Connecticut, who had the privilege of suffering a 48-14 beatdown on their home turf. Squeaking by University of Virginia and Purdue University by five total points, the Orange have proven their mettle at home.
What’s powering Syracuse to this quick start out of the gate? Junior quarterback Garrett Shrader has been effective on the ground, sitting at No. 7 in the country in expected points added through the run. On the other side of the ball, defensive back Garrett Williams is tied for No. 9 in the country in interceptions with two to boot. This week, Williams was recognized as the Atlantic Coast Conference Defensive Back of the Week  after forcing and recovering a fumble to go along with an interception.
Washington Huskies
The Huskies rumbled their way to 8 sacks in a show of strength for the defense in a home win over Stanford last week. Fifteen total sacks put the defensive unit at No.4 in the nation and No. 1 in the Pac-12, just ahead of USC’s 14. Sophomore edge rusher Bralen Trice can claim 4.5 of those sacks for himself as he sits second in the conference on the year. Trice anchors an imposing edge rushing group that managed 20 pressures against Stanford and will look to repeat that performance at UCLA this week.
You can’t talk about the Huskies without talking about their quarterback, Michael Penix Jr., who paces the country in passing yards with 1,388. He’s averaging 9.7 yards per attempt for the swashbuckling No. 4 offense in the country.
Kansas Jayhawks
Does Kansas have a legitimate Heisman candidate? Is wheat yellow? Their quarterback Jalon Daniels is currently on course for the highest quarterback rating of any quarterback in the country in the last 18 years. In the last two games the Jayhawks have played, Daniels has accounted for 688 total yards of offense and 10(!) touchdowns. The 19-year-old true junior burned his redshirt after throwing 3 touchdowns in an overtime win against University of Texas at  Austin last season, and he hasn’t looked back since. 
Head Coach Lance Leipold is the hottest name on the coaching market on the back of the Hawks’ 4-0 start. Nebraska sees him as a worthy Scott Frost replacement, Georgia Tech is sniffing around and Arizona State needs a new coach to take them to the promised land. Offensive Coordinator Andy Kotelnicki has helped him run some of the most innovative plays in the country, earning himself head coaching shouts as well. Against Houston, Kansas ran a two-quarterback look at one point, with the ball ending up in the hands of former walk-on tight end Jared Casey.
Look past the mercurial quarterback play and the shrewd play-calling, and you’ll see an incredible program turnaround. Kansas’ sellout vs. Duke marked just their second sellout in the last 13 years, a sign the fans are getting on board with this team. It’s been a rough decade out in the wilderness for this team, with Kansas failing to reach the four-win plateau a single time since 2009. In fact, this year’s Jayhawks’ four straight wins marks only the third time in Big 12 history the team has kicked off the year 4-0. Not since the halcyon days of Mark Mangino has Lawrence, Kan. seen a football team that ranks anywhere above completely inept. Can Lance Leipold bring back those good old days and take the Jayhawks bowling by surviving a tough conference gauntlet? That remains to be seen, but he can rest assured that America is watching.

Thanks to the internet, discovering new music has never been easier.However, while it’s easy to hop on new trends and listen to the latest singles, it’s a little harder to rifle through the years and find the beauty of classic albums. So, sit back, relax and read on to discover what classic albums pair well with some recent modern favorites.
If you like “Sling” by Clairo, check out “Déjà Vu” by Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young
Clairo captured the acoustic fall vibe with last year’s “Sling,” and while the soft reflective tracks mixed with her pop background still hold up, there’s something to be said for the soft classic rock of “Déjà Vu” by Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young. 
Clairo’s yearning for domestic life on “Zinnias” is backed by soft plucked guitar as she sings, “Sure sounds nice to settle down for a while/ Let the real estate show itself to me / I could wake up with a baby in a sling.” Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young practically originated this kind of sweet domestic scene with “Our House” where they croon, “Our house is a very, very, very fine house / With two cats in the yard / Life used to be so hard / Now everything is easy cause of you.” It is a never-failing tearjerker and brings to mind simple pictures of true, shared love. 
The two albums match well if you’re looking for something that feels like a warm blanket on a chilly autumn day, with orange leaves falling in the background and a cup of steaming apple cider.
If you like “A Brief Inquiry Into Online Relationships” by The 1975, check out “LCD Soundsystem” by LCD Soundsystem
The 1975’s 2018 album “A Brief Inquiry Into Online Relationships” is chock full of societal references and lead singer Matty Healy’s critiques of modern culture. The album is witty and bitter, sarcastic and genuine and inane and intellectual. The same dichotomy can be found on the fantastic self-titled 2005 debut album from LCD Soundsystem.
Healy owes a lot to James Murphy, lead singer and driving force behind LCD Soundsystem. In an interview with Pitchfork, Healy revealed a lyric that was cut from their upcoming 
upcoming album: “You owe James Murphy 20 percent of this song, your career, and the whole idea/Of living in the city with a tingle of fear.” The biting social commentary of The 1975’s “Love It If We Made It” echoes Murphy’s own tongue-in-cheek takedown of contemporary music culture in “Losing My Edge.” 
The lazy, detached and doomed relationship Healy writes about on “TOOTIMETOOTIMETOOTIME,” singing, “But I only called her one time / Maybe it was two times? / I don’t think it was three times / I didn’t mean to two-time, two-time you,” feels like a spiritual successor to Murphy commenting, “When I was a little boy / I laid down in the grass / I’m sure you’d feel the same if I / Can fuck you here tonight” on “Never as Tired as When I’m Waking Up.” Both bands tackle the world with the same kind of careless grace that you can’t help but appreciate. 
If you like “The Slow Rush” by Tame Impala, check out “2112” by Rush
Kevin Parker of Tame Impala is one of the most interesting acts in music today. His precision and complete dedication to his music makes each and every album an entrancing listening experience from beginning to end. His latest effort, “The Slow Rush,” is no different. Songs such as “One More Hour” give listeners a fantastic seven-minute run full of drops and crescendos that feel like they belong in the final scene of the best movie you’ve ever seen rather than closing an album. 
The clarity and thoughtfulness of Parker’s work feels reminiscent of one of the most precise bands of all time, Rush. Their 1976 stunner “2112” begins with the 20-minute-long song of the same name that moves with such intense vision through a winding, undulating story that leaves the listener breathless by the end. 
The other tracks are filled with similar passion for precision and reflection, such as “Lessons” which recalls the contemplative tone of “On Track.” Both Rush and Tame Impala have captured the ups and downs of life and great music, and it’s so interesting to see how genre and time can interplay to have both bands achieve such massive success from their dedication to the craft.
As artists and bands continue to push the envelope of music, it is always satisfying to look back and see how albums from anywhere from 20 to 50 years ago are similar and different. By growing your music repertoire, you can achieve a better understanding of music in all its forms. There’s something to be said for experiencing an old album for the first time and thinking of all the people who have listened to it before — imagining them lining up outside the record store, eager to take it home and spin it, or grabbing the cassette and taking a hike with their Walkman, appreciating the tunes out among nature. It’s both a reset and an adventure for our modern tastes when it comes to queueing up an old classic right after a modern banger. Hopefully this list will inspire you to seek out something old, but new!

Many college students are all too familiar with the scenario: You’re enjoying yourself at a social gathering and talking to someone you’re meeting for the first time. After the grueling and methodical year, major and hometown small talk, they ask, “What’s your big three?” 
As the person who defaults to this question at nearly every party, I can say there tend to be one of three responses. One, they say astrology is a bunch of BS and jump at the first opportunity to leave the conversation. Two, trying to show that they’re not clueless, they awkwardly stumble over their words as they pull up their birth chart on Snapchat. Or three, least commonly, they clearly have experience discussing their chart, open an astrology app and ask to see my chart too. 
While I don’t think astrology can say everything about a person, with the vastness of the universe and cosmic energies all around us, it’s difficult for me to believe that everything happening in space doesn’t have an impact on each of us on Earth. Whether you’re a believer, skeptic or just plain confused, here’s a rundown of what you should know if you find yourself in this situation. 
When the average person thinks of their zodiac sign, they’ll think of their sun sign first. This is the easiest one to find because it only relies on your birth date. Anyone born between Sept. 23 and Oct. 23 is a Libra, no matter the exact location or time they were born. However, your sun sign isn’t the end-all-be-all of your chart. So, if you don’t feel mysterious enough to be a Scorpio or organized enough to be a Virgo, don’t count out astrology’s accuracy just yet. 
The twelve signs are divided into four elements: earth, fire, water and air. Earth signs — Taurus, Virgo and Capricorn — are characterized by their groundedness and stability, fire signs — Aries, Leo and Sagittarius — are bold and daring, water signs —Cancer, Scorpio and Pisces — are emotional and intuitive, and air signs — Gemini, Libra and Aquarius — are intellectual and communicative. 
When looking at elements, it’s important to look at your whole chart, rather than just your sun sign or even your big three. Your big three could have only earth and water signs, but combined with your other placements you could be air or fire-dominant — meaning the element most present in your chart. 
Another, less-known way to categorize signs is by their modality. Cardinal signs — Aries, Cancer, Libra and Capricorn — are the leaders of each season (i.e. the spring equinox falls in Aries season) and are the signs of change, trendsetting and leadership. Taurus, Leo, Scorpio and Aquarius are fixed signs. Falling in the middle of a season, they are typically more stubborn, grounded and focused. Finally, each season ends with a mutable sign: either Gemini, Virgo, Sagittarius and Pisces. They are typically referred to as the “philosophers” of the zodiac and can exhibit flexibility and open-mindedness. 
Because each modality has one sign from each element, every sign is unique in its combination of the two categories.  Capricorn’s combination of an earth sign’s stability with a cardinal sign’s trendsetting nature makes it a great sign for leadership, and Pisces gets the reputation of being an imaginative, daydreamy sign from its water and mutable blend. 
The sign that gives the most comprehensive insight into one’s life is the rising, or ascendant. To find this, you’ll need to know your city and time of birth and input them into a birth chart calculator. If you don’t know your birth time, you can still find nearly every other placement in your chart, but birth time is necessary to find your ascendant.
The sky is split into 12 sections, — or houses — much like the hours on a clock. Each house rules a different part of life, such as friendship, money and travel. The signs and planets that fall in a specific house in your chart can determine what you value in each of these areas and can even predict in what areas you’ll find future success. 
For example, the 10th house, or 10th segment of the sky, rules fame, honor and career. If a Pisces mercury is in this house, this person would probably be successful in some sort of emotional communication — such as songwriting or filmmaking.
Your rising sign is especially important because it always falls in your first house, and you can determine each subsequent house by moving through the zodiac calendar. If you have an Aries rising, Taurus would rule your second house, Gemini third and so on. 
Rounding out the big three is the moon sign. The moon rules emotions and is basically who you are, at your core, when no one else is around. Upon reading someone’s chart for the first time, their moon sign tells me the most about them because it’s the part of themselves that they don’t usually share with the rest of the world. For example, my Scorpio sun, Cancer rising and the plethora of air placements in the rest of my chart may characterize me as someone who goes with the flow and craves chaos, but my grounding Taurus moon represents my desire for comfort and uneasiness about change.
Mercury rules communication and learning, Venus rules love and Mars rules sex and aggression. These, combined with your big three, are usually referred to as your “big six.” If you really want to impress the next person who asks you about your big three, pull out your knowledge of these planets too. 
The further a planet is from the sun, the slower its orbit and longer it stays in one sign. For example, Pluto tends to stay in a sign for a whole generation. From November 1983 to January 1995, Pluto was in Scorpio. This roughly equates to the timing of the millennial generation. Generation Z is categorized by Pluto in Sagittarius, which is generally a rebellious, fiery, spontaneous sign and greatly reflects the traits of this passionate generation. 
It’s not as common to ask for someone’s placements outside of their big six because, especially in college where people are close in age to each other, most people have the same placements from Jupiter to Pluto. 
There’s certainly enough room to go deeper into birth charts. Masculine and feminine signs, nodes, aspects and specific degrees of planets and a plethora of other celestial affairs can provide even more insight into what the stars say about you — but let’s save that for another day.

Far too often in the United States, art museums have taken exclusionary attitudes towards typically underrepresented groups. Artists outside of the Western canon go unnoticed, leaving us with an incomplete understanding of the global arts community. Fortunately, this attitude is rapidly changing, with many organizations undergoing new efforts to display pieces originating from all parts of the world. Here in Los Angeles, we get a first-hand look at this shift.
The Los Angeles County Museum of Art officially opened “The Space Between: The Modern in Korean Art” on Sept. 11. A collection of over 130 pieces, the exhibition includes a variety of art mediums, including oils, photographs and sculptures. 
Curated by Virginia Moon, LACMA’s assistant curator of Korean art, the collection is carefully arranged to emphasize the stylistic changes resulting from foreign influences in 20th century Korea.
“This project is a rare opportunity to introduce people to the modern art of Korea by looking at the influences that drove its development,” Moon said in the exhibition advisory. 
Indeed, the various influences are complex and difficult to talk about. For Korea, the first half of the 20th century was characterized by extortion, colonization and conflict. Nevertheless, the adversity faced by the peninsula’s civilians led to the growth of a new national identity and pride in their homeland. The themes explored by the exhibition have striking relevance, both historically and also to the modern day. 
The exhibition is organized into five distinct categories, representing different periods of artistic development. Spanning from 1897 to 1965, the exhibition covers the periods of the Korean Empire, Japanese colonization, the Korean War, the growth of feminism and the decade leading to the contemporary period.
The exhibition’s first section, “Modern Encounter,” begins in 1897 with the establishment of the Korean Empire under the last two kings of the Joseon dynasty. The influx of photography resulting from the governmental change had an impact on the tendencies of Korean painters, becoming absorbed with the concept of intensely exact depictions of real life.
Kim Eunho’s “The Portrait of Emperor Sunjong” perfectly represents the budding enchantment with photography. In the draft portrait, the emperor’s facial features are exquisitely shaded, while his uniform (with clear influences from Western military garb) is outlined in exacting ink strokes. While the final portrait was destroyed in a fire, the draft still demonstrates the nuanced layers of artistic influence in the period of empire.
The next section, “Modern Response,” follows art in Korea during Japanese colonization between 1910 and 1945. Art training, only available through Japan, taught adaptations of Western art. At the same time, photography continued to grow, gaining recognition as a genuine art form.
This section is perhaps the most enthralling of all. Working in styles previously foreign to Korea, artists manipulated the Western techniques for their own purposes, portraying their own identity through the mediums of other people. This fascinating intersection of culture produces incredible artistic statements, such as Lee In-sung’s “Valley in Gyeongju,” a depiction of Korean agriculture with clear Western influence and bold use of color.
“Modern Momentum,” the third section, follows Korean art after World War II and into the Korean War. At this point, the influence of the United States and other Western countries was direct, transmitting cubism, abstraction and expressionism into the peninsula’s art environment. 
This section contains a myriad of stunning works, including Kim Whanki’s “Jars and Women,” Lee Soo-auck’s “6.25 War” and Lee Jung-seob’s “Tied People” and “Children.” The two pieces by Lee Jung-seob, scraped onto tinfoil linings from cigarette packs, display the hardships confronting Korean people during the period. 
The penultimate section, “The Pageantry of the New Woman (Sinyeoseong) Movement,” centers around the arisal of Korean feminism, particularly pertaining to the growth of educational opportunities. The surge in feminist attitudes was met with resistance from the Confucian-based society— a conflict emblematic of the many clashes in Korean society during this time.
Undoubtedly, the most recognizable and iconic piece of this section is Shin Nakkyun’s portrait of Choi Seunghui. Exemplifying the Sinyeoseong look, the portrait captures the famous entertainer with bobbed hair in a shorter, Western-style dress. Shin’s photograph, the most printed in Korean history, brilliantly captures the rapidly changing societal perceptions of women. 
Finally is “Evolving into the Contemporary,” a glimpse into the future of art in a fractured Korean peninsula. The art displayed in this section contains pieces that start to take art to its extreme, replete with all sorts of abstract and contemporary techniques. Korean artists begin to cast off all foreign influences, coming to artistic expressions that were decidedly unique to Korea. 
The art contained in this section is arguably the most challenging, yet engaging, of the entire exhibit. An example is Quac Insik’s “Artwork,” a piece created by reconstructing a glass pane that was fractured with a lump of metal. Quac’s experimentation with the boundaries of art mediums represents the liberation of artistic techniques, a stark contrast to the beginning pieces of the exhibition.
Moon’s curation of the pieces invites viewers to come to new conclusions about Korean art and history, while also perhaps encouraging reflection on our time. The 130-piece collection is an excellent demonstration of the “space between” the historical and contemporary Koreas – a powerful experience for all visitors.

Prior to deciding on USC as the place where I’d spend the next four years of my life, I struck a deal with my parents: one year on-campus, three years as a commuter, sort out transportation afterwards.
Truthfully, I never really anticipated driving to and from school. Rather, I expected to take the Metro Expo line enroute to Santa Monica and ride a slew of buses to get back home. 
But lo and behold, I was presented with the opportunity to ride along with Bess, who happens to be a Volkswagen Passat. While I may have started this column off as a car-privileged commuter, I grew up with 20 years of using public transportation to get to and from each of my schools, USC among them. 
I agree and have said that the Metros and Big Blues that this city funds may not necessarily be the best modes of transportation, but they’re there for us to take ample advantage of. It is true that this University oftentimes has left its long-distance commuters behind without strong support systems or even general resources on how to get the best out of the commuter lifestyle. However, it seems a bit narrow-minded to downplay the transportation systems that exist around the University and its satellite campuses. 
Some students can travel from an hour or two away, not just by car but by several means of public transportation — bus, shuttle, train, bike. We are often posited with that option; in fact, it can be said that technically all students are commuters in one way or another.
Saying that I was a commuter was a nice little icebreaker more often than not, followed by the question: “Where from?” 
The answer to that question sets the tone of the conversation to follow as well. I usually say, “Oh, from the UCLA area,” to which I’m greeted with a smug grimace at the mention of our crosstown rivals. But a quick follow-up comment is always about some amount of time: “What is that, 30 minutes out?” “Is that like an hour with traffic?” “Is that like 10 minutes if you break the speed limit on the freeway?” 
To that last question, yes. Anyways, let’s throw in a classic transition tool. 
“But Lois,” you, the commuting Trojan, ask. “What does it mean to commute in the first place?”
I could be a real hardass and pull a dictionary definition: “to travel back and forth regularly (as between a suburb and a city).” Others may refer to this commute as the journey between places of home and work. 
When I transitioned from on-campus to off-campus housing (i.e. with my parents), I saw the word change definitions when in different hands. Does the commute start once you get out the front door? Does it start once you start your engine, step foot onto the bus, tap your TAP card? Does it start once you wake up and make your way to the bathroom? What about during the pandemic? Was Zoom — oop — a means of commuting to school?
Commuting, when the letters are jumbled around and some real determination is put into it, means committing. The entire premise of a commute derives itself from our willingness and/or inner push to go somewhere for whatever purpose. We’ll take whatever means available to us to get from point A to point B — sometimes maybe a bit rushed, other times at our own pace. 
Regardless, the commute turns into a physical manifestation of commitment.
Whether it is the five-minute walk to class or the two-hour drive from beyond county lines, there’s a particular reason and a greater goal beyond that which leads us to make the trip. It sounds a bit meta, but give it some thought the next time you make your way to class by whatever means: Why do we do it?
Sometimes, we get tired — more often than not, life doesn’t go our way — so we make a smaller “commute” to a place of refuge and reclusiveness: bed, the bathroom, maybe a place in nature. It’s still a commitment to our personal health and some semblance of well-being.
As folks go beyond the University and into a period of emerging adulthood, we make the commute to new places, new friends, new opportunities. I make the commute to campus in the morning not only to make it on time for class, but also to spend time with my best friends (outside of Bess) who make being at this University worth all the money that went into it from my parents’ wallet. While I may not make that same commute post-December, I’ll make a new commute with new goals and responsibilities. 
It may seem a bit odd to close a column in the middle of the fall, but given that this column kicked off randomly in the spring out of writer’s block, I think that I was able to get everything off my chest in half a year’s time. But even as I say farewell to writing this column, always get home safe, Besties.
Lois Angelo is a senior who wrote about the perks, downsides and necessities of the commuter lifestyle in his column, “The Carpool Lane.”

After the record-breaking heatwave the second week of September, I’m left wondering what USC is thinking by leaving their students in their cramped, old dorms. Not all of us have the luxury of living in the USC Village’s air conditioned rooms, so how are students expected to complete their work in the blistering heat? Chief Student Health Officer, Dr. Sarah Van Orman, has even warned us of the dangers of the heat that has killed thousands across the United States and the mental toll the heat can have on students. Even so, those residing in New North, Birnkrant, Marks Tower and Pardee Tower continue to be forced to get innovative or suffer the consequences. 
Outside of an email from Van Orman stating that “During a heat wave, a warm building is a sign of good air exchange,” there aren’t many details depicting a better and more accessible solution to ensure students’ wellbeing. So here’s what I imagine they are thinking as students bake in the ovens that are their dorms:
Is air conditioning really that important? Students complain so much about the heat in the dorms, but the worst that’s ever happened is heat stroke. Besides, the students look happy enough with their thriving grades and flashing smiles. I wish they’d just stop whining.
Honestly, I’m just tired of it because I already do so much to acknowledge the AC situation.  The students simply don’t appreciate what I do!  Speaking of which, I think I’ll make sure the dorms send out emails to let students know just how much they take for granted. It shall read:
“We did everything we could to try to help cool the buildings. This included opening doors and windows and placing fans throughout your building.  We continued to check and replace fans as many went missing.”
Alright, I’m back, and the emails have been swiftly sent. Hopefully that improves our public relations, and maybe the students will be more grateful — wait, is that a student reply I see? I’ll check it later, but I’m glad they’re starting to apologize for feeling so entitled. Anyways, as you know, not only did we open doors when it was hot outside, but we even opened windows. What more can they ask of us? I even remember hearing about the health benefits of natural breezes over artificial ones, and here in Los Angeles, air can’t get more crisp than this! The smog just adds extra flavor. So who cares if it’s 100 degrees outside? Let the natural air in! If anything, I should be complaining about being cramped in my freezing office. I can already feel the effects of breeze deprivation on my lifespan.
They even have the audacity to blame us for not installing AC into all of the dorms. Not to mention, I did have AC installed at least in the lobbies and elevators of most dorms, so if the heat really was too much, students should’ve just studied in the elevators and taken the opportunity to make connections with their peers.  
I bet if you stayed long enough in the elevator, you could meet almost everyone in the dorm by the end of the day — now that is some serious networking! You see, here at USC, we pride ourselves in our strong Trojan Family, and having no AC in the dorms is just another example of our efforts to encourage social interactions. A strong Trojan network simply wouldn’t be possible if students stayed cooped up in their rooms.
In any case, It’s not like I’m made of money. My endowment is a mere 8.126 billion dollars, and they expect me to pay for new AC systems? That would leave no room to increase the football budget. Imagine USC without an overhyped football team!
A heat wave isn’t an excuse to break clearly outlined, reasonable rules. Here in California, I’m completely aware that heat waves happen every year, and summers can be brutal. To address this issue, I decided long ago to ban the use of portable ACs in the dorms. If one student suffers, we must suffer together because here at USC, we value the idea of community and inclusivity. Besides, if all students used portable AC units, there might be a power outage, and resolving that issue would be almost as much trouble as installing a controlled central AC system — why would we do that?  
It just seems so intuitive that to keep my rankings high, students need to follow simple rules and trust my judgment. I’m actually quite generous if I do say so myself. In the past, I’ve seen students with nine fans in their rooms, and I let them be — on second thought, maybe I should set a limit. Need I also mention that some students sneak fans that I set up in the hallways, and I just let them return them with no questions asked? They really are greedy.
My acceptance rate is at an all time low, the football team is thriving, the Marshall School of Business and Viterbi School of Engineering are growing in reputation — I’d say things are fine as they are. In the grand scheme of things, who cares if students lose a couple good nights’ sleep as long as they perform well? If they can’t stand it, students can always try their luck with housing reassignments. Anyways, I’ve got a lot on my plate, so enough ranting for today.  Please stop complaining so I can work peacefully in my air conditioned office. A little heat never hurt anyone.
