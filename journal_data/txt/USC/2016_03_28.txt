Anthony Bailey, vice president for strategic and global initiatives, and Elizabeth A. Graddy, vice provost of academic and faculty affairs, issued a memorandum Friday advocating for USC’s further involvement in the support of Syrian scholars and students.
The Provost accepted the Graduate Student Government Senate’s request for USC to become a member of the Institute of International Education’s Syria Consortium for Higher Education in Crisis.
Beside joining the consortium, USC will devote itself to “providing scholarships each academic year for at least three Syrian students who meet the standards for admission to the university,” according to the memorandum.
Among USC’s other efforts in providing educational opportunities to endangered scholars, as mentioned in the statement, are its membership in Scholars at Risk and the IIE Scholar Rescue Fund.
GSG released its resolution advocating for USC to join the Consortium in October 2015, stating that in light of the fact that “the Syrian Civil War is in its fifth year, and there is no indication that a peaceful resolution to the conflict is forthcoming,” and that since many other American universities have made the effort to join the Consortium, it is USC’s core values that “compel it to act in solidarity with Syrian students and scholars.”
The Institute of International Education was founded in 1919 and has dedicated itself to providing advanced education opportunities around the world through scholarships, policy discussion and “protecting scholarship around the world,” according to their website.
The IIE Syria Consortium has declared a state of academic emergency in the wake of the crisis in Syria, urging universities to provide scholarships to Syrian students.
In the memo, Dean of Religious Life Varun Soni was named as the liaison between the University and incoming Syrian students in order to “cultivate a safe haven for these displaced scholars and students,” while also striving to “afford them every opportunity to succeed in their academic endeavors here.”
“This is a worthy cause and one that is consistent with our values and our goal of becoming the leading private institution dedicated to the global public good,” Bailey and Graddy said in the memo. “We are dedicated to continuing our important work with Scholars at Risk and the IIE Scholar Rescue Fund to help secure placements for these academics, as appropriate.”

The USC Pakistani Student Association, Ansar Service Partnership, USC Muslim Student Union, DESI Project, Desis That Politic and the USC Interfaith Council held a candlelight vigil Monday night to remember the 65 people who were killed and support the 300 people who were injured in an explosion in Lahore, Pakistan over the weekend.
“Wishful thinking about the peaceful tolerance of Islam cannot interpret away this reality: hands are still cut off, women still stoned and enslaved, just as the Prophet Muhammad decided centuries ago.” 
― Ayaan Hirsi Ali, Infidel
“We ex-Muslims living with Islam’s formal and informal death penalty for apostasy know that Mohammedanism is a cruel and deadly fraud. 
The 164 jihad verses in the Qur’an make jihad warefare a central tenet of the Islamic creed. At least 75% of the Sira (biographies of Muhammad and quotes attributed to him) is about jihad. 
The largest part of the Islamic texts (the Qur’an, hadith and sira) relate to the treatment of unbelievers, kafirs. Approximately 67% of the Qur’an written in Mecca is about the unbelievers, or politics. Of the Qur’an of Medina, 51% is devoted to the unbelievers.”
Muslim terrorism has been very good for the candle business.  
All kidding aside…When will people start realizing that Islam and terrorism fit like hand-in-glove.  I mean, people, even the very first Muslim, Mohammed, led 60 battles against infidels, stole from caravans, wiped out entire villages (in the name of Allah), etc.
This IS the defining international event of your generation, folks, and you better read up on it, even if by candlelight, if you are serious about understanding the reasons behind Islam’s history of terrorism.

Paulette Chandler, a lecturer in French language and culture at USC, died unexpectedly on March 7 following a medical procedure.
“She’ll be really missed. It’s hard for us, as a department, to learn the news and realize that she’s no longer with us,” said Julia Chamberlin, a senior lecturer of French language and culture.
After earning her Ph.D. in French literature at USC in 1992, Chandler went on to teach in the Department of French and Italian for 24 years. Before joining USC’s faculty full-time, she also taught at many other local institutions, including the California Institute of Technology and University of California, Los Angeles.
“She was very dedicated to USC. She was always here, even on days when she wasn’t teaching — she would be on campus, meeting with students, and trying to do as much as she could to help out her students and do the best she could as a teacher,” Chamberlin said.
Chandler was an accomplished scholar who regularly presented her work on French literature at conferences and was active in USC’s chapter of the national French honor society Pi Delta Phi.
“I lost a friend and a piece of France anchored in L.A.,” Nathalie Burle, a senior lecturer of French language and culture, said in an email to the Daily Trojan. “Dr. Chandler was an accomplished linguist and scholar of French, and her students appreciated her for enriching their lives and providing them with an in-depth knowledge of the French language and cultures that very few can provide. It would be an honor if USC could pay tribute to her hard work by giving her posthumously the recognition she deserved.”
Her colleagues will remember her for the kindness, enthusiasm and generosity that she showed to her friends and students.
“She always had a smile on her face and cared so much for the people with whom she worked that she not only remembered their birthdays, but always greeted them with flowers, chocolates and kind words. She could be counted on to cultivate an esprit de corps, not just among her students, but as a collegial presence within the department,” Sherry Velasco, the chair of the Department of French and Italian, said in an email to the Daily Trojan.
Her constant optimism and sense of style served as a source of inspiration for those around her.
“One of the things that really struck me about her was that she really, really never had a bad day. You could never tell if she was having a hard day or if she was upset about anything, because she was always smiling and never complained about anything,” said Lorena Gallego, a senior lecturer in Spanish language and culture. “The way I will remember her is how stylish, fashionable she was, and how she never had a single bad day.”
Gallego cited Chandler’s kindness as the enduring legacy that she will leave behind at USC.
“She represented USC very well. She had all the positive qualities that Trojans stand for,” Gallego said. “She was really just a wonderful, wonderful person.”
Chandler is survived by her husband, Richmond Chandler.
The Department of French and Italian will be holding a memorial service for Chandler from 4 to 6 p.m. on Wednesday in Doheny Memorial Library, room 240.

The U.S.-Mexico Commission for Educational and Cultural Exchange, has partnered with the Price School of Public Policy to introduce a new Mexican scholar-in-residence program focusing on binational energy policy coordination in Mexico and California. This would allow a selected scholar to conduct research and policy forums in a four-month residency in conjunction with Price in Sacramento.
Dean of USC Price and H. C. Erwin and Ione L. Piper Chair Jack Knott said the collaboration will seek to explore renewable energy sources while strengthening the international partnership and leadership, according to a press release.
“Historic reforms in the area of energy policy by the government of Mexico and the state of California have created an extraordinary opportunity to explore cross-border collaboration, particularly in the area of renewable energy sources, and strengthen our partnership and global leadership in this area,” Knott told USC News earlier this month.
The program will allow for communication on energy policy on a national level and plans to instigate student response.
“One of the things we look forward to doing once this person is confirmed: We plan to reach out and do a joint panel, get students involved,” said Mario Enriquez, a representative from the USC Price Latino Student Association.
Enriquez praised the program for focusing on these types of policies and stresses how students in his organization can broaden their involvement in and knowledge of binational energy policies.
The program primarily seeks to bridge academic researchers in California and Mexico, increase student collaboration and connect these students to policymakers, according to Director of USC Mexico Angela McCracken.
“They are going to bring in a Mexican perspective … They are going to bring in someone that has a bilateral perspective on U.S.-Mexico studies, an expertise,” McCracken said.
McCracken lauded the strategic location of Price Sacramento while bringing attention to the historical relevance of the California-Mexico relationship.
“Sacramento is the perfect place. The Price Center in Sacramento has a long history … of hosting delegations for Mexico in Sacramento in binational policy forum,” McCracken said.
Both institutions have collaborated over the years, and McCracken said that the organization recognized what needed to be addressed and created an opportunity to fulfill that need. Improving the relationship between Los Angeles and Mexico has included involvement from people with USC ties in the past, such as Carlos M. Sada, the consul general of Mexico in Los Angeles who has had with extensive experience with Price over the years.
Sada was paramount to creating this program, along with Janet Denhardt, director of Price in Sacramento, and Hazel Blackmore, the executive director of COMEXUS.
Mexico’s policy shifted in 2013 from state-owned energy sector to allowing private-sector participation.
McCracken said that the energy reform being implemented in Mexico parallels the environmentally protective, sustainable energy policy being developed in California.
“The idea is both California and Mexico are dealing with the same problems related to energy in different contexts and in a transformative time. So they both can learn, one from the other,” McCracken said.

It was November 20, 2010, the last football game of the season at Harvard Stadium. The outside linebacker for Yale University, Jesse Reising, was about to leave college with his life planned out — following graduation, Reising was slated to enter the Marine Corps. In a matter of seconds, his plans would be derailed.
With just 10 minutes left in the final quarter, Reising saw the Harvard running back head toward him. He distinctly remembers that his shoulder pads were too low. Before he knew it, he was lying on the 27-yard line, barely conscious. The impact had detached two nerves in his neck, and paralyzed his right arm above the elbow, shattering his hopes of joining the Marines.
Reising soon found another way to serve his country, through helping veterans assimilate into college. He connected with veteran and fellow Yale graduate Christopher Howell to create the Warrior-Scholar Project, which came to USC last summer.
Partnering with 11 top-tier colleges such as Yale and Vassar College, the Warrior-Scholar Project was established as a skill bridge between enlisted service to college.
Even though the government provides monetary support for veterans in the G.I. Bill, it is not clear how many of them graduate from college. The Warrior-Scholar Project recognizes that receiving a degree requires not only the opportunity, but also  the ability to adjust to academia. For veterans that enlisted out of high school, the gap between institutions makes it difficult for them to transition back into school, especially college.
“Over 40 percent of post-GI dollars are finding their way to private, for-profit college industries,” said Sid Ellington, the executive director for the Warrior-Scholar Project. “Most of these people are really smart, very capable. They just aren’t prepared to take full advantage of the opportunities of higher education.”
The program works like an academic boot camp every summer, lasting from one to two weeks. It focuses on two types of skills: tactical and strategic.
Tactical skills include things like breaking apart a syllabus, time management and taking notes efficiently. Strategic skills, also known by the scholars as “engi-reading,” are taught by professors at the University.
The professors teach about liberty and democracy from the perspectives of their own disciplines, such as international relations, political science, law, philosophy or English, making analytical reading and writing easier for veterans to identity with. Veterans of all different demographics are selected.
“There were some people still going through medical treatment. There were veterans that were retired 15 or more years. The ones that were enrolled in college were from both four-year and community college,” said Tina Fleming, a tutor at the USC Warrior-Scholar partnership.
The program director of the Warrior-Scholar Project at USC is Jesse Ramirez, a junior majoring in political science. Originally from Chicago, Ramirez moved to Los Angeles to be closer to his brother, who was stationed in San Diego with the Marines. He attended Santa Monica College for two years before transferring to USC. At the University, he started working for the Veterans Resource Center and was invited by his supervisor to attend a veteran issues meeting, where the opportunity for the Warrior-Scholar presented itself
“A veteran myself, I’ve always worked with other veterans. so it’s a very close community,” Ramirez said. “I resonate with all of their struggles — I was in a position where I needed help and that help wasn’t available.”
The program at USC was carried out for the first time last summer with 14 students and lasted for about a week. In the morning they were taught by USC faculty, then spent the rest of the day in critical thinking and critical writing courses interspersed with talks about the college application process, visits to the library, and other aspects of university life. According to Fleming, with this rigor came some difficulties.
“The material that they read is really heavy, and the immersion process for students definitely isn’t easy,” Fleming said. “There are moments when people break down or feel like they just want to walk away because it’s really intense, and they might not get too much sleep. But in the end, the majority of people are satisfied, and the program really promoted USC by having the students come to campus and learn through USC professors.”
The idea for the program coming to campus was first proposed by the chairman of the Board of Trustees, John Mork, who heard about it from a veteran who works for him. Mork asked Provost Michael Quick to consider supporting it, and eventually USC became the first West Coast school to join the program. Mark Todd, vice provost and manager of the WSP branch at USC, said that he finds the most rewarding part of the program to be the reciprocation for the service veterans have provided us through education.
“What is most rewarding to me, [is]that we offer the best of what USC has, to help those who have sacrificed so much to serve us,” Todd said. “They come away believing that they can really succeed at a university like USC. It is powerful.”

After taking USC to its best season since 2009 and first tournament appearance since 2011, the Trojans are extending the contract of head coach Andy Enfield — originally under a six-year deal — for two more seasons.
The extension means Enfield will be under contract through the 2020-2021 season, adding on to a six-year deal Enfield signed in 2013 that was worth more than $1 million a year.
After the departures of forwards Malik Martin and Darion Clark, Enfield’s contract extension adds further consistency to a USC basketball program trending upwards.
After taking the Cinderella Florida Gulf Coast Eagles to the Sweet Sixteen in 2013, Enfield has made a new mark at USC and is looking forward to what next season has in store.
“The men’s basketball staff is very appreciative of the great leadership and support from our administration and we are very thankful to have talented players in our program who are terrific representatives of USC,” Enfield said in a press release. “We look forward to an offseason of continued development for our players that will set the foundation for an exciting 2016-17 season.”
Enfield led the Trojans to their first 20-win season since 2009. He won 21 games, a nine-game improvement from the 2014-2015 season.
In the 2016-2017 season, the Trojans will be bringing back all of their starters as well as three quality recruits in Jonah Mathews, De’Anthony Melton and Harrison Henderson.
Considering that USC has had six coaches since 2004 including Enfield, extending the former Johns Hopkins graduate was definitely a long-term move in the right direction.
Enfield had reportedly drawn interest from other schools with coaching vacancies, including Pittsburgh. Later on, though, the Panthers ended up hiring former Vanderbilt head coach Kevin Stallings, who took the Commodores to the NCAA play-in game after going 19-11 during the regular season.
With his recently signed eight-year deal, Enfield will be the longest-tenured coach since Henry Bibby in the late 1990s and early 2000s and will be at USC for half the time of the longest tenured coach in USC history, Forrest Twogood, whose career with the Trojans spanned from 1951 to 1966.
Another B.S. move by the athletic dept. Enfield was still a .500 man in the conference including the Pac-12 tourney. A first round loss in the ncaa so what’s the big deal. He had no idea what to do at the end of that game with Providence. Coaches galore out there that could have done the same thing. Forget about all those home wins against mediocre teams.  Let him prove his worth next season before adding any years to an over blown contract to start.

In an effort to reduce the time demands on NCAA student-athletes, Pac-12 Commissioner Larry Scott is traveling to all of the schools in the conference to meet with student-athletes from various sports about their concerns.
He visited USC — the fifth campus on his trip — last Friday, and yet, he hasn’t spoken to a single baseball player.
“I don’t think we’ve met any baseball players yet because on every campus — they’re out playing a game somewhere,” Scott said.
It turns out even arranging a time to talk about time demands is a challenge. Indeed, as he was talking, the baseball team was playing in the second game of a three-game series at UC Santa Barbara. While Scott was meeting with a group of USC student-athletes on Friday afternoon, six different athletic teams had competitions. Four of them — including baseball — were on road trips that ranged from Seattle, Washington, for men’s tennis to Atlanta, Georgia, for men’s swimming.
Student-athletes from eight teams did make it to the meeting at the John McKay Center, where Scott and Erik Price, the Pac-12 associate commissioner of compliance, had an open dialogue with the student-athletes regarding the rigorous schedules that they face. They discussed proposals that will be brought up during the NCAA convention in January 2017.
Kamali Houston, a senior on the rowing team and the president of the Trojan Athletic Senate, said it was a productive meeting.
“We had a very open and honest conversation about time demands and what’s going on in our daily lives,” Houston said.
NCAA rules limit student-athletes to 20 hours of practice a week; yet, a study conducted in April 2015 of Pac-12 athletes found that, on average, they are spending 50 hours a week on athletics during the season. A majority of those hours are spent traveling to competitions in addition to receiving treatment and other “voluntary” hours.
Scott said he just recently learned from student-athletes of the term “prehab,” which are exercises to prevent injury.
“I’ve got a much more full appreciation for the time commitments around actual practices,” Scott said. “What it takes to get ready before practice to make sure you don’t injure yourself, and in the limited practice time you have, you can get the most out of it — then the rehab, the strength and conditioning. There’s so much more that goes into being an elite athlete than just the practice time and the travel time.”
For student-athletes, it is difficult to balance the time spent on the sport with time in the classroom. But, with the NCAA insisting the “student” come before the “athlete” in the title, they have an obligation in making sure academics come first. Just 2 percent of NCAA student-athletes receive a scholarship out of high school for athletics, and only 2 percent of those student-athletes turn pro after college. A NCAA recruiting pamphlet from August 2014 explicitly states, “In reality, most student-athletes depend on academics to prepare them for life after college,” creating a dilemma between how time should be split between academics and athletics.
“How do you balance [the focus on athletics], respect that and give them everything that they might want there, but also recognize that most student-athletes here are not going to be professional athletes and not going to compete afterward?” Scott said. “They’ve got this amazing opportunity for a USC degree and access to amazing faculty. [We want] to make sure that they’ve got enough time and flexibility to fully take advantage of that.”
Yet, many student-athletes find themselves falling behind in classes because of the large time commitment to athletics. The same 2015 survey found that 54 percent of Pac-12 student-athletes do not have enough time to study for tests and 80 percent missed a class for competition during the 2014-2015 academic year.
Scott added that the lack of availability of training facilities on campuses forced students to miss class in order to train.
“That’s a direct result of the amount of resource that’s being applied to the facilities and the staff that’s available to help student-athletes,” Scott said.
Road trips take a toll as well. A majority of teams have road trips during the week, which takes away from class time and adds to the stress of the already high-pressure life of being a Division I athlete.
Scott pointed to basketball as an example, and USC’s men’s basketball team can certainly attest to that. The Trojans finished 3-7 on the road last season and the scheduling may have been an indirect cause. They took three separate road trips while school was in session to Oregon, Arizona and the Bay Area, played two games in each stop, and lost all six of them.
Following a blowout loss at Cal on Feb. 28, a Sunday night, head coach Andy Enfield talked about the hardships of being on the road.
“In this league, it is very difficult to win on the road, especially when you’re sitting around in the hotel for five days,” Enfield said. “These are challenging road trips where you go on the road for five days. Now we’ve got to fly back and [the players have] got to be in class on Monday morning at 8 a.m. The road is very challenging.”
While both sides acknowledge the issues at hand, there hasn’t been a clear-cut solution to fixing the problem. Scott noted that student-athletes don’t necessarily want to cut back on the “voluntary” hours they spend on the sport outside of practice because they want to avoid injuries and stay sharp. He was unwilling to commit to adjusting the actual competition schedules, although he admitted the scheduling made the “biggest impact” on time demands and left open those changes as a possibility.
Houston proposed an idea of mandating a 12-hour break after competitions for rest and recovery.
“Scheduling, making sure that coaches are open and transparent with the schedule and athletes are ready to expect what’s going to happen with their week and can plan ahead,” Houston said as another talking point in the meeting.
Still, there are only so many hours in a day. Seventy-one percent of Pac-12 student-athletes reported that athletic commitments kept them from sufficient sleep, and the ugly truth remains that being a student-athlete means signing up for a time-crunched collegiate career.
“Given the commitment of being an elite student athlete, if you’re going to do a great job academically and you’re going to compete at the highest level, there’s very little time for anything else,” Scott said.

The baseball team hosts Loyola Marymount on Tuesday night, hoping to kick its season into gear. The Trojans take on the Lions for the second time this season — a 2-run home run from senior Timmy Robinson led USC to a 4-3 victory on the road at Page Stadium the first time the two teams met in late February.
The Trojans’ record currently sits at 11-11, but they have won four out of their last six games and will try to push their record back over .500 with a win against LMU.
“Just let the momentum roll,” Robinson said. “Take it one game at a time, stay together as a team, and pick each other up.”
After an encouraging series win against Cal to open up this season’s Pac-12 play, USC beat CSU Fullerton and had a three-game winning streak heading into the team’s last series against UC Santa Barbara. The Trojans struggled, dropping the first two games in Santa Barbara, but they returned to Dedeaux Field to salvage a win in the series finale.
After giving up 15 runs in the first two games of the UCSB series, head coach Dan Hubbs challenged the Trojans’ pitching staff to perform to their potential.
“That’s what it comes down to: If we pitch better, we’re going to go on our run,” Hubbs said. “If we don’t pitch better, we’re going to be right around .500 and hope that we win enough.”
Hubbs focused on the need to keep pitches low in the zone and limiting walks.
“With the guys who are out there, there’s enough arm strength and talent,” Hubbs said. “They just have to stay within themselves and not overthrow.”
Hubbs also told his pitchers to trust in their ability and the hard work they have been putting in between games.
“I’m handing you the ball for a reason because I think you can get this done,” Hubbs said, “And it’s on them to go out and do it.”
Redshirt junior pitcher Joe Navilhon, who earned the win in Saturday’s game, agreed with his coach and said it was up to the pitching staff to pick the team up.
“I think if we pound the zone and really compete, we have a good shot at winning a lot more games,” Navilhon said. “If we play our game and give our team a chance to win on the mound, our hitters have shown that they can score runs for us.”
Indeed, the Trojan bats awoke from their slumber in the series finale. Robinson led with 2 home runs and five RBIs as USC tallied 14 hits en route to a 9-5 victory. Now tied with junior catcher Jeremy Martinez in home runs — overtaking sophomore Adalberto Carrillo — Robinson said the Trojans just needed to take the field with confidence.
“It doesn’t matter who we play. We have to play our game … and we have to keep fighting,” Robinson said.
USC faces off next against an LMU team just recovering from a six-game losing streak, all within the span of one week in March. The Lions rebounded to win four of their next six games, however, and will look to avenge their early season loss to the Trojans on Tuesday before traveling to San Diego for a three-game set.
First pitch between the Trojans and LMU is set for 6 p.m. at Dedeaux Field.

As March winds down to a conclusion, one of the NHL’s most talented teams is being forced to cope with some reasonably disappointing news.
The Montreal Canadiens have been eliminated from playoff contention.
The Habs’ demise started when goaltender Carey Price got hurt exactly a month before Christmas. Arguably the best netminder in the game had gone down with a lower-body injury — and he would not return. The 2015 Vezina Trophy winner played just 12 games this season, collecting 10 wins and posting a save percentage of .934.
Twelves games is obviously a minuscule sample size, but Price was clearly in great form when he was able to play this season. However, this team is currently a cellar dweller in the Eastern Conference’s Atlantic Division. For a team with this kind of quality to be mathematically out of the playoff picture before April is simply staggering.
The Canadiens entered the 2015-2016 season as one of the real contenders. The hype felt legit. Alex Galchenyuk’s move to center was looking like a smart tactical move as the team leapt out to a 9-0 start to the season.
Galchenyuk was combining with Lars Eller and Alexander Semin, and the team was playing well.
But the season wore on, and everything started crumbling.
Once a star in the league, Semin turned in limited production and was waived in early December. After a tumultuous conclusion to the calendar year, Habs fans could still feel optimistic.
The most precious resource of all was on their side: time.
But 2016 wasn’t kind to Michel Therrien’s team. The front office opted to trade Devante Smith-Pelly to New Jersey just prior to the trade deadline. The team’s releasing of such a talented-yet-underachieving player encapsulated the futility of the Habs’ season. Smith-Pelly has been lighting it up for the Devils since the trade, likely forcing fans in Montreal to wonder why he struggled to do the same for their team.
The Canadiens have been floundering for much of the season — and not just because of Price’s absence or even a surprisingly lackluster top line.
Tomas Plekanec just logged his first goal in 20 outings on Thursday night. P.K. Subban exited a game against Buffalo on a stretcher earlier this month. He is currently dealing with a neck injury.
There have been so many speed bumps for the Habs, but it still feels strange that they aren’t even in the playoff conversation.
The Habs were ousted by a pretty incredible Tampa Bay team in last year’s conference semifinals. This season has of course been a step in the wrong direction, but with Max Pacioretty, Price and Subban, this certainly does not feel like a franchise in long-term trouble.
After all, a Bruins team with a loaded roster didn’t make the postseason last year.

As the season moves toward the heat of conference play, the men’s tennis team is also getting ready to say goodbye to its only senior: Max de Vroome.
The 6-foot-5 native of Vught, Netherlands, came to USC in 2012, a season after the amazing ride that saw the Trojans win the NCAA crown four years in a row. After clinching the 2014 Championship in his sophomore season and playing in a brand-new tennis stadium early this year, de Vroome, a captain, is seeking another strong season with one of the best teams in the nation before finishing his degree in business administration.
De Vroome was already successful as a junior player, winning a couple of ITF titles and reaching the quarterfinals at the junior French Open in 2012.
“Honestly, I didn’t know much about college before I visited [USC],” de Vroome said. “I heard USC had a great team. So I was visiting multiple schools and as soon I stepped on the campus … it’s just so pretty here, so nice to walk around. It’s like paradise.”
De Vroome was drawn by the continuity of success and a strong coaching staff.
“The team is great; the coaches are really good,” de Vroome said. “We’ve had a great program over the years. That was a big thing for me, that they weren’t good one year but being consistently good. That says something about coaches.”
Before committing to the Trojans, de Vroome had to make a harsh decision. As NCAA rules treat student-athletes as amateurs, it would have been impossible for him to turn pro and play at the collegiate level at the same time.
“It was a tough choice for me to make,” de Vroome said. “Back home we don’t have the college system. But especially for a [men’s] tennis player, the average age in the top 100 is around 28, so making that choice when you’re 18 is rough. I think college here is the perfect solution. You get a degree, and you get to play tennis every day.”
Being the only freshman on the team and away from home, the first year as a Trojan had a lot more challenges to offer in addition to the ones he faced on the court.
“You come into the community and the whole team is like family,” de Vroome said. “I was the only freshman, but it really didn’t feel that way because you’re hanging out with rest of the team so much and they really support you and help whenever they can. I was used to traveling because I traveled as a junior player, but I had never been away from home that long.”
In addition to this new experience, the initial adjustment to a different country also served as a challenge: there was a new language, a new culture, a new way of life.
“My first semester was tough; everything was in English,” de Vroome said. “The cultures are very similar in a way, but there are also small differences everywhere. It takes a couple of months to get adjusted, but you’re kind of living in a dream.”
Tennis provided him with one of the best memories from his journey at USC: winning the 2014 NCAA championship.
“I don’t think I will ever, ever even come closer to that,” de Vroome said. “It was such a magical moment. The whole team is there, jumping around, it felt like living in a dream for a moment.”
De Vroome picked up a racket for the first time when he was five, and he never looked back. But he’s not the only one in the family to have a passion for tennis. Indy, his 19-year-old younger sister, has already turned pro and is ranked in the top-400 of the WTA rankings. At this young age, she has already won three singles and five doubles titles in the ITF circuit.
“My mom was always really into sports, really competitive, so we were sports-minded,” de Vroome said. “My brother started to play tennis, and I was two years younger and I was jealous and I wanted to play with him because I looked up to my big brother. That’s how I got into it and started to play more and more and got competitive against each other. Then my sister started to play, and nobody wants to lose against each other. I think the competitiveness into it got it rolling.”
As far as inspirations go, de Vroome’s idol on the court is 17-time major winner Roger Federer, known for his competetive yet composed behavior on the court.
“I just love his classiness, how he walks on the court every day and does his thing and walks away,” de Vroome said. “He makes it look easy.”
But de Vroome still turns back to his family for their support and inspiration.
“My mom, my brother and sisters are huge role models for me,” de Vroome said. “I really look up to them, how disciplined they are, how hard they work everyday. They make me stay disciplined too.”
While he’s focused on his final season, de Vroome is also keeping an eye on his future, which could lead to a career either on or off the courts — or both. De Vroome has an internship this summer at Guggenheim Partners in Santa Monica.
“I’m going to do that and see how it goes from there,” de Vroome said. “Maybe I’ll get a full-time offer from them. Maybe I’ll go pro.”

Canadian musician LIGHTS will release her new acoustic LP, Midnight Machines, on April 8. The album will feature six songs from her third studio-length album, Little Machines, in addition to two new songs, “Head Cold” and “Follow You Down.”
Midnight Machines is a success and sounded as if each track were meant to be acoustic in the first place, rather than her usual electronic, synth-pop sound. With string section accents, the album is put together well through a rustic yet uplifting approach.
Midnight Machines is more than just an acoustic record — it’s a complete reinvention of some of the songs from Little Machines,” LIGHTS said in an Alternative Press article. “I worked with a string section and my band to create this ultra-vibey, late night version.”
While Little Machines is an electronic-based LP, Midnight Machines takes on a new element, straying away from synths and dabbling in a completely acoustic sound. Right away, a notable shift is seen alone in the album name alone. Little Machines has a symbolic feel in that the album evokes of little machines working to tie each track together. Midnight Machines, while offering a similar perspective, also gives way to dark imagery and a more serious tone.
The album has an almost somber vibe, and while it is a lot slower and more raw-sounding than Little Machines, the album is uplifting and real. LIGHTS’s voice will leave listeners in a trance, feeling inspired and full of wonder. The album is soft and hopeful, yet vulnerable at the same time. Her soothing voice has a calming effect, and it feels as if one were in the room listening to her play one-on-one.
Each track is personable, and has authentic components. Her new track, “Head Cold,” hones in on the struggle of moving forward and not looking back, a common circumstance many people can relate to. With a verse that identifies with being human, “caught in a landslide, stuck on the inside, like everybody else,” she emphasizes a “keep moving” message. LIGHTS uses a head cold as a metaphor for life and the struggles that will come, but soon will pass.
For those who are fans of Birdy, Daughter or Ellie Goulding, LIGHTS is the perfect musician to listen to. In addition to its warm and inviting theme, Midnight Machines works cohesively and achieves a depth in sound through its classical-sounding instrumentals and acoustic base. Midnight Machines shows LIGHTS’s versatility as a strong musician.

“You want to be special? Be careful what you ask for.” If /r/lostgeneration, a Reddit forum for millennials who feel victimized by the baby boomer generation, had an art gallery, it would look like Herakut’s Masters of Wrong, currently on display at the Corey Helford Gallery in Boyle Heights. The latest set of paintings from the German artist duo pairs today’s nihilism with whimsy and innocence. This artwork challenges even the most jaded millennials to approach contemporary issues with the optimism of a child.
Herakut is composed of graffiti artists Jasmin Siddiqui and Falk Lehmann, whose work has spanned continents and mediums. The over 20 paintings currently on display celebrate the staples of millennial life — Pokémon, Kim Kardashian and even a nod to My Little Pony. through the graffiti medium, bridging today’s pop art with the ’90s angst that it grew out of.
Though Masters of Wrong clearly emphasizes the unique culture of today’s American youth and the unprecedented challenges that they face, Herakut’s artwork transcends generations and cultures. As part of the project, the artists visited Culver City High School and collaborated with art students to create a new mural at the school. Attendance at the gallery’s opening Saturday was high and all-ages.
Perhaps the most interesting part of the gallery is the interactive “playground” installed in the rear corner. Herakut seeded the area with a parade of cardboard kids holding up pessimistic messages: “Sh-t is f-cked up,” and “Trump makes America hate again.” On the wall, in menacing capital letters it says, “If Tetris has taught me anything, it’s that errors pile up and accomplishments disappear.”
Visitors were then invited to paint their own messages, and as the crowd-sourced additions began to sprawl across the wall, their content shifted mystifyingly toward optimism. From chaos emerged messages of empowerment and hope, in many languages: “No estás solo. Estamos unidos,” wrote one visitor. Another added, in Korean, “Art is not for your inspiration alone, but an inspiration to be shared with others.”
The Masters of Wrong playground reveals the defining quality of Herakut’s art: It works. Herakut’s intentions are unmistakable in pieces like “Satan,” which shows the Statue of Liberty walking a Donald Trump pig on a leash. The painting could stand alone as a political cartoon, but its accompanying text reads more like a reaction GIF: “When you ask Satan instead of Santa for a new president.” By combining the generic conventions of two different generations, Herakut asserts the universality and imminence of contemporary problems.
Pieces like “Sailor Mom,” which pictures a pregnant teen in a Sailor Moon outfit, might feel uncomfortably didactic for some viewers. However, overall Masters of Wrong does not come across as fabricated millennial cultural literacy or a petty attempt at “reaching the kids.” In today’s culture of moral relativism, Herakut takes a clear moral stance in all of their pieces, stomping on the eggshells with refreshing directness.
Therefore, it is fitting that one of the opening paintings of such a decisively opinionated gallery should ask the same question as Marvin Gaye in “Save the Children”: “Who is to blame?” Through their upfront portrayals of the today’s world, Herakut invites visitors to withdraw their pointed fingers and instead extend outstretched arms.

Last weekend, I went out with my friends for the first time in what seemed like ages. As the semester has inevitably escalated to its climax, the copious amount of schoolwork that requires me to stay home alone almost every night has put me into a rut. However, after realizing that all work and no play makes Arya a dull boy, I reasoned that a riotous night out with my friends might be enough to break my rigid demeanor.
Though my social life seems to revolve predominantly around bar-hopping and clubbing, I’ve never been that fond of going out; rather, it’s something I do out of necessity. Likewise, I’m not much of a fan of anonymous hookups. True, I’ve had my fair share of them, but I’ve always valued personal and intellectual chemistry over colloquial intimacy. This somehow makes me an oddity within L.A.’s gay dating scene, as most people I’ve encountered don’t value these types of relationships like I do. And in a society that prefers Tinder over tenderness, I blame my high standards of love on Puccini.
Powerful Puccini · Puccini’s La Bohème is one of the most performed operas in history. The show explores themes of love, loss and heartbreak.incil ute quisid. – Photo courtesy of Metropolitan Opera
I’ve mentioned several times before in my column that Puccini’s La Bohème is my favorite opera. I’ve seen it live more than any other opera. There’s even a tattoo on my forearm dedicated to the Act I finale. And though Puccini’s sumptuous orchestrations make me weak at the knees, it’s more the similarities I share with the characters that hold it so close to my heart.
In Act I, Rodolfo, a writer, opts out of spending an evening on the town with his friends to stay home and write. Moments later, he meets Mimì, a seamstress who lives in his building, and a deep connection is immediately established between them. Like Rodolfo, I place great importance on the first encounter; I’m able to feel in my gut early on something substantial is present. However, I’ve also mentioned that La Bohème has given me a skewed perception of love and dating. And I don’t necessarily mean monogamy, per se — it is more about allowing these connections to blossom without capping it after a two-week fling.
I was beginning to believe that this preference made me an anomaly; this type of intimacy seems to conflict with the philosophies of my friends, who prefer casual encounters and don’t always understand my outlook. However, I’m slowly realizing for as optimistic as I am regarding dating, I’m equally as cynical when it comes to other queer men because I just automatically assume no one is interested in pursuing a relationship. But preferring intellectual intimacy shouldn’t correlate with having impossible standards; chemistry isn’t something that one should sacrifice. However, perhaps the key to breaking my critical attitude toward other men is to stop trying to dictate the unpredictable. There is a fine line between cynicism and realism — and that’s a line I’m still learning to balance on.
However, that isn’t to say things have been exclusively abhorrent. I started dating someone about a month ago, a guy who seems to value personal connection as much as I do. It has been difficult to completely strip my mind of any negative assumptions regarding others’ intentions, but I’m learning to accept things as they are.
But just to throw it out there, Rodolfo and Mimì would have never fallen in love with each other if they didn’t keep their standards high.

Last week, the Undergraduate Student Government Senate voted against the removal of  Commuter Sen. Jacob Ellenhorn, opting instead to withhold the remaining $250 of his stipend after determining that he had failed to uphold his duties as a USG senator. The decision, which was announced 24 hours following a three-hour hearing, came as a result of Program Board Executive Director Diana Jiménez’s formal complaint, which charged Ellenhorn with violating USG bylaws. By voting against removal and in favor of suspending Ellenhorn’s stipend, USG rightly reinforced the fact that student leaders must be held to the standards to the office which they were elected.
In her formal complaint to USG, Jiménez alleged that Ellenhorn acted contrary to his responsibilities as a USG senator, citing his failure to adhere to proper procedures when scheduling meetings with students, violating USG’s Code of Ethics by bringing speakers that contributed to a hostile campus environment and disobeying filming regulations at Program Board events. Though only a small majority of the 11 voting senators believed that Ellenhorn’s actions called for removal, a greater number of them agreed that the violations warranted some form of punishment. The Senate ultimately voted 9-2 in favor of suspending the remainder of his senatorial stipend.
Though Ellenhorn’s infractions certainly warranted some form of accountability on the part of USG, the senators were right in their decision to suspend his stipend in lieu of removal. The fact of the matter is that impeaching Ellenhorn and removing him from his role within the Senate with only one week remaining in his term would have been symbolic at best. At worst, it would provide Ellenhorn with even further ammunition to perpetuate the false notion that the impeachment charges were launched against him as punishment for his conservative viewpoints.
But the fact of the matter is that these impeachment charges have nothing to do with Ellenhorn’s political views. In fact, several conservative members of the Senate have managed to fulfill their leadership positions and even express dissenting opinions without violating USG’s bylaws. Rather, it has everything to do with his failure to abide by the very rules he was elected to uphold — among them the responsibility to abide by USC’s Code of Ethics and maintain a respectful campus environment. By suspending the remaining portion of his stipend, USG effectively emphasized that such a failure does indeed have consequences.
In response to the Senate’s decision, Ellenhorn released a statement in which he announced that he had never intended to personally benefit from his stipend and instead planned to donate the entirety of the $2,000 to the Wounded Warriors Project. But this announcement of his own generosity doesn’t change the fact that USG leaders are awarded their stipends because of the time they dedicate to upholding their leadership responsibilities. Just as one wouldn’t expect to receive a paycheck after failing to show up to work, USG senators earn their stipends by fulfilling their student government duties — regardless of where that stipend ultimately goes. By invoking the Wounded Warriors Project — an organization that has recently come under fire for alleged corruption after it was exposed for misusing its donations — Ellenhorn fails to address the purpose of student stipends or why a majority of his peers in the Senate felt strongly enough to vote that he shouldn’t receive his.
When Sen. Ellenhorn ran to serve in the USG Senate last spring, he did so knowing that he would be expected to serve responsibly and be held accountable to both his constituents in the student body and to his peers in USG. It is contingent upon these expectations that our student leaders hold office and are compensated fairly. By acting contrary to his responsibility as senator and violating USG bylaws, Ellenhorn put both his position and his stipend at risk.

Jacob Ellenhorn, until the end of his term Tuesday, is a USG Senator. Ellenhorn is also the president of the USC College Republicans. The USG Senate’s decision to issue him a slap on the wrist by refusing to issue the last $250 of his $2,000 stipend reveals a damaging inability to differentiate between these two roles and a dangerous precedent for free speech moving forward.
Since Program Board Executive Director Diana Jiménez pressed charges against Ellenhorn calling for his impeachment, the burden of proof lies with the prosecution. However, seeing as the trial was closed to the media and no video or transcripts of the hearing have been released, by default, I remain convinced of Ellenhorn’s innocence.
The first charge, that Ellenhorn mishandled a case of female students who alleged that they faced anti-Semitic discrimination at the hands of the Women’s Student Assembly, is the hardest to judge without a full disclosure of evidence, but it is also the only charge which, if proven guilty, would prove Jiménez’s assertion that Ellenhorn failed to fulfill his duties as a senator.
The second charge, that the USC College Republicans’ hosting of Milo Yiannopoulos violated the USC Code of Ethics, is perhaps the largest overstepping of USG’s jurisdiction. Punishing Ellenhorn for voluntarily bringing controversial speakers to campus in a civil setting sets a dangerous precedent for free speech and is entirely antithetical to the challenging and diverse nature of academia. Though as a private university, USC does not have to enforce constitutional protections on free speech, I would certainly hope that we collectively decide to defend intellectual diversity, and I definitely cannot support USG speech-policing my fellow students.
Furthermore, this charge demonstrates a misunderstanding of Ellenhorn’s two entirely separate roles on campus. If Ellenhorn were not a senator and the school still found his actions in violation of the USC Code of Ethics, it seems much more likely that he would face disciplinary action from the administration, which is trained to handle these issues in an unemotional, objective manner. Instead, USG falsely conflated Ellenhorn’s role as a representative of the people with his more private role as the president of the USC College Republicans.
Finally, the Senate found Ellenhorn guilty of violating film codes from the USG Code of Ethics when he filmed USG- and Program Board-funded events and released footage to the press. While I morally support freedom of the press, and in giving footage to the press, Ellenhorn was acting as an agent of the media, I do understand that this was, perhaps, an actual violation. But again, this begs the question of how any other student would be treated in this case. If Ellenhorn were not so vocally political, would he have faced the same treatment?
Additionally, the role of a senator is to discern the allocation of student funds. Releasing footage of questionable events to the press is not an act of vilification; it enforces USG transparency.
While this case involves a number of facets that I have publicly defended, I would be defending Ellenhorn just the same if he were a Marxist extremist or a religious fanatic. Unlike certain members of USG, I believe that this is not a case of politics, but of free speech and precedent.
For all the talk about campus climate and safe spaces that our current student government likes to perpetuate, this case produced horribly personal and incendiary rhetoric. People became so wrapped up in the technicalities of Ellenhorn’s multiple roles that too many forgot that he is also a person. People writing to the Daily Trojan have accused him of being a “fraud,” “crude” and “want[ing] to be martyred.” The comments section is even worse, with commenters openly stating that they have never met him but asserting that he seems “obnoxious” and “stupid.”
Save for his feelings and $250, this trial holds little consequence for Ellenhorn. He graduates in a matter of weeks and will attend the USC Gould School of Law in the fall. But for the rest of us, the right to free speech on this campus and a student government devoid of personal vendetta are no longer precedents we can take for granted.

My relationship with one of my best friends has fizzled over the past couple years. She’s dealing with a lot of personal problems, and while I am more than happy to be there for her, she has a tendency to lash out at those closest to her — she needs to bring those around her down in order to boost her own self-esteem. It’s gotten exhausting over the years, and it’s at the point where I want to avoid hanging out with her because I am always emotionally drained afterwards. I feel like a terrible friend since she is going through a lot, but I feel like, for my own mental health, I need to reduce the time I spend with her. Is it time to cut her out of my life for good?
Depending on her preferred form of deprecation (blatant putdowns versus passive aggressive gibes, e.g.) you may consider calling her out on it. If you don’t think your friend will be receptive to hearing your concerns, I’d recommend temporarily excusing yourself from her life. This situation is different from just having a catty friend because you have indicated that your friend has a profoundly negative emotional, and perhaps even physiological effect, on you. I am sympathetic to her undisclosed personal problems, but also hard-pressed to think of reasons why you should be an emotional punching bag. Bringing others down is not a healthy way to build self-esteem. Hopefully your absence will encourage your friend to partake in some introspection that will lead to a healthier, reciprocal relationship.
