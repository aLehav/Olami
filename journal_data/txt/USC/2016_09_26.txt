Keith Feldman, an assistant professor of ethnic studies at UC Berkeley, spoke to students on the intersection between race, culture, knowledge and state power at Doheny Memorial Library on Monday. The event, titled “Patterns of Life: Race, Relationality, U.S. Imperial Culture,” was sponsored by the Departments of French & Italian, American Studies & Ethnicity and Comparative Literature and the Middle East Studies Program.
Julia Erickson | Daily TrojanPower play · UC Berkeley professor Keith Feldman argued that media and art forms are shaping the country’s relations with the Middle East.
Feldman began the event by showing images of Laurie Anderson’s modern art exhibition Habeas Corpus, a commentary on the conditions of Guantanamo Bay.
The theme of utilizing campaign-driven social media, works of installation art and photography to render the violence of the War on Terror continued to crop up throughout Feldman’s lecture, a phenomenon Feldman termed “critical awareness media.”
“They often utilize the performance of proximate embodiment as a way to elicit an ethic of intersubjective relationality that might other be foreclosed by processes of racialization,” Feldman said. “A rhetoric of sentiment often augers a sense of interiority for both perpetrators and victims alike, and this binary is often operationalized.”
Feldman also addressed the recent refugee crisis, citing The New York Times’ recent use of virtual reality to drop the reader within a Syrian refugee camp as a way of forging an empathetic connection between people lacking proximity.
“The form seeks to close a perspective gap between reader and subject … But rather than stage a form of substitution, the displaced promises recognition through immersion,” Feldman said. “It’s still completely mediated, but the encompassing aesthetic of present materializes in an approximation of shared place that calibrates the promise of empathy.”
Feldman’s first book, A Shadow Over Palestine: The Imperial Life of Race in America, explores U.S. racial and imperialist relations. He is currently in the process of writing his second book, Patterns of Life: Raciality, Visuality, Global War.
He recently edited a forum on blackness and relationality, and has had numerous articles published in New Centennial Review, Al Jazeera and Palestine Square.
As the floor opened up for discussion, Feldman argued that the concept of using media and art forms to bring awareness was not a novel one, but that such mediums were shaping U.S.-Middle East relations and changing the dynamic between the so-called victims and perpetrators.
“There’s a sympathetic Arab or Muslim subject that’s being constituted in this work … These are depictions of a liberal subjectivity that can be recognizable and hence empathized with,” Feldman said. “Being cognizant of how our critical conversations around Islamophobia and anti-Muslim racism were cohering in certain kinds of ways precluded us from seeing them in a non-vilified manner.”
Ariel Reyes, a graduate student majoring in comparative media and culture, was surprised to consider the men behind the machines — those who were manning the U.S. drone strikes.
“The whole notion of perceiving the drone operator and seeing it from his viewpoint was interesting,” Reyes said. “We usually hear in the media of the reaction from a drone, portrayed as violent images, but the people operating them, they’re working a 9-5 job.”
Cord-Heinrich Plinke, a Ph.D. student in comparative studies of literature and culture, appreciated how Feldman’s lecture opened up a variety of perspectives and drew people who seemingly did not have much in common.
“The audience was comprised of [people of] different backgrounds, various departments, which was interesting and unexpected,” Plinke said. “I thought the focus on visuality was interesting. It really changed the perspective for me because the rest was quite abstract.”

USC’s Casden Institute, which centers its research on the role of Jewish voters in America, held a panel, titled “Decision 2016: Jews and the Presidential Election,” to discuss the election as it relates to Jewish voters in Town and Gown on Sunday.
Julia Erickson | Daily TrojanMinority majority · Zev Yaroslavsky (left), Laurie Levenson (center) and Mel Levine (right) spoke on Jewish support for other minority groups Monday.
The event was the 2016 installment of the Lee Lecture Series, a lecture series that brings together scholars from varied fields to talk to the L.A. community.
The panel featured six members of the Jewish communities and experts in their respective fields: Steven Windmueller, professor emeritus at Hebrew-Union College; Larry Greenfield; investment banker and former executive director of the Republican Jewish Coalition; Mel Levine, former U.S. representative, 27th Congressional District; Laurie Levenson, professor of law and director for center of legal advocacy at Loyola Law School; Dan Schnur, director of the Jesse M. Unruh Institute of Politics at USC; and Zev Yaroslavsky, former member of the L.A. County Board of Supervisors from District 3.
The event consisted of a one-hour discussion by the panelists about topics related to the presidential candidates and Jewish-American voters, followed by a 30-minute question and answer session.
The panelists spoke about their views and thoughts on the presidential election in regards to the Jewish population. As Greenfield noted, there are many analogies between United States history and Jewish history.
“The ancient kingdom of Israel essentially modeled the balance between empire and anarchy,” Greenfield said. “Our Western Judeo-Christian political tradition is built on this moderate middle path: limited self-government of, by and for the people, respect for the equality of all human beings, and the eternal struggle for freedom within the boundaries of law.”
Several of the panelists — including Levenson and Schnur — noted that as a minority group that has often been treated more harshly in the past as a result, it is only natural to be sympathetic toward the other targeted minority groups in the 2016 election.
“We are the other, we always have been,” Schnur said. “We have an obligation to dispel that fear and face the hatred … and reach out to support more vulnerable ‘others.’”
That sentiment was echoed by Yaroslavsky, who believes that Jews see some of their own history as a minority in some of the rhetoric by today’s candidates.
“Once you unleash the forces of prejudice against one group, no group is safe,” Yaroslavsky said. “When you’re a minority, it’s a matter of not just civic duty, but survival — you have to be involved in democracy, in government, in electing people.”
This panel was not without its disagreements, both ideologically and on the subject of who should be the next president. The few things they could all agree on were Trump’s failings and that the Dodgers win was reason to celebrate. Although there was only one Republican on the panel, Greenfield, there was much more diversity of opinion among the audience, which was reflected in the questions that were asked, which ranged from doubts about Clinton’s honesty to reservations about Trump’s immigration policy.
As polarizing as the election and political discussion is, for Windmueller, the election as it pertains to the Jewish community is an important discussion to have due to the historically lower mobilization of Jewish voters in this election cycle.
“We’re seeing in the Jewish community for the first time, somewhere between 8 and 10 percent of American Jews are not prepared to vote in this election,” Windmueller said. “Jews tend to be highly motivated and politically involved, but this election we see something different, which is why I think it’s important that these conversations take place.”

The 1988 video “Why Chi Phi” was not popular when its creator, Scott Benton, first showed the footage to his fraternity brothers. In fact, some thought it was downright embarrassing. It was not until Benton returned to USC for his master’s that he collaborated with an Annenberg student to edit the film and shape it into what today has been viewed nearly 120,000 times on YouTube and featured in a Huffington Post article.

“We wanted to create a kind of memento for ourselves, something that years later we could go back to and laugh at,” Benton said. “We were poking fun of each other as fraternity members, but also capturing how much we loved our fraternity and how proud we were of being Chi Phi.”
During the 1990s, however, the fraternity fell on hard times as upperclassman, who constituted many of their members, began to graduate. Due to a loss of leadership and members, Chi Phi could no longer afford to keep their house and left the Row in 1999. Now, the fraternity is coming back to USC after a 17-year hiatus.
Michael Coates, a Chi Phi alum and the head of the fraternity’s Eta Delta Career Advantage Program, emphasizes that Chi Phi was not banned due to behavioral issues or misconduct.
“Our house never had a problem with hazing or discrimination,” Coates said. “We were actually one of the more diverse houses, with one of the highest GPAs on the Row.”
According to the Interfraternity Council’s bylaws, IFC can choose to expand by adding a new fraternity chapter or recolonizing an old one if given the approval of voting members and IFC fraternity chapter presidents. Once members vote to open the expansion process, applications are sent out to various fraternal organizations.
IFC received approximately 15 applications from various fraternity chapters, with and without ties to USC, and narrowed the pool down to four chapters. These fraternities then sent representatives to the University to advocate for their respective houses in front of the IFC Executive Board and fraternity presidents. Once the presentations concluded, the chapter presidents voted to offer Chi Phi a chance to recharter their USC chapter in the Fall of 2016. Another fraternity, Phi Kappa Tau, was also allowed to recolonize their chapter in fall 2018.
“While I cannot speak on behalf of all of the voting members of the Interfraternity Council, two aspects of Chi Phi’s application and presentation that really impressed the Board were the amazing show of alumni support, and Chi Phi’s governing body’s genuine commitment to achieving excellence for their USC chapter,” IFC Vice President of Recruitment and Expansion Alex Budde said in an email to the Daily Trojan. “Chi Phi has many distinguished and impressive alumni that attended USC, and all have a deep passion for reestablishing a strong chapter by committing a lot of effort to ensure that happens.”
The new Chi Phi, according to Coates, will center around career development and the EDCAP program, which is modeled after the Marshall Business School’s own Career Advantage Program. Chi Phi members will be paired with one alumnus and one active member for one-on-one support in their chosen field of study. This peer support and access to alumni and their resources aim to develop career-driven young men with large professional networks upon graduation.
“The alumni are bringing their networks and knowledge to help these guys get their foot in the door, get access to opportunities and create a lifetime of career advantage,” Coates said. “I believe that we are creating a new paradigm for social fraternities and I hope that, because of this, Chi Phi becomes a sought-after frat on the Row.”
The fraternity also wants to revive the heterogenous image they had in the ’90s. According to Coates, Chi Phi has always been diverse, and now, they want to expand their definition of diversity to include men of different sexual orientations as well as transgender men, since their identification documents — such as a driver’s license — reflect their sex change. Coates also emphasized that Chi Phi seeks to recruit upperclassmen that have historically been ignored in the recruiting process in favor of freshmen.
“We are an incredibly diverse fraternity and have always prided ourselves on ethnic diversity,” Coates said. “Fraternities should reflect the school population and that has always been Chi Phi’s goal and we have been one of the few that have pushed [diversity] throughout our history.”
Chi Phi is currently in the recruitment process and plans to extend bids to about 35 students on their bid night Oct. 9.

Katie Chin | Daily TrojanThe great debate · Viewers gathered at Wallis Annenberg Hall for the first presidential debate Monday evening. Candidates Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump discussed their positions on topics like the economy, immigration and gun control.
Hundreds of students crowded into all four floors of Wallis Annenberg Hall to watch the first presidential debate between Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton and Republican candidate Donald Trump on Tuesday evening.
The USC Annenberg Center on Communication Leadership & Policy and the USC Jesse M. Unruh Institute of Politics co-hosted the event, which began with a pre-debate panel entitled “Behind the Scenes: Preparing & Spinning Presidential Debates.”
The panel featured Judy Muller, an award-winning television journalist, NPR commentator and USC professor of journalism; Antonia Hernández, a Commission on Presidential Debates Board member and president and CEO of California Community Foundation; and Gordon Stables, Annenberg assistant dean of student affairs and USC director of debate and forensics.
The panelists began the discussion by explaining why this presidential debate in particular was so highly anticipated.
“This is a precious time when the American public has an opportunity to see how these two individuals respond to questions and interact, and for the public to get a sense of the person who will be in the most powerful office in the country,” Hernández said.
Muller explained that the debate was the most written-about event that’s taken place so far in the election, and that part of the reason was due to the candidates involved.
“[This debate features] the first female candidate against the first reality show candidate. Donald Trump is the draw here,” Muller said.
Muller and Hernández also both repeatedly emphasized how Clinton’s gender has impacted her media coverage throughout the campaign season.
“Hillary is being judged more harshly. It gets in the way, and I’ve seen it many times for a lot of women. If [a woman] is serious, [she’s] perceived to be angry. If a man looks serious, he’s perceived to be serious,” Hernández said. “For students viewing these debates, I’d challenge you to judge your own biases.”
Muller noted that while Trump is typically judged by whether or not he is “presidential enough,” the question surrounding Clinton is whether she is “likeable enough.”
At the beginning of the event, Stables mentioned that due to the demographics of the room, it was likely that most of the audience was rooting for Clinton. The screening of the debate itself started with cheers for Clinton and jeers for Trump.
Daniel Wahl, a sophomore majoring in business administration, was one of the few students showing support for Trump.
“I’ve never watched a presidential debate with an audience before, and clearly most people here support Clinton,” Wahl said. “I thought it was important to show support and clap for Trump. We’ll see how the popular vote goes, [because] it is hard to tell in a crowd that is about 90 percent liberal-leaning.”
The panel emphasized that the engagement of the candidates with young people is a key part of this election.
“Both candidates need to address the needs, challenges and aspirations of millennials,” Hernández said. “And it is very important for millennials to show up and vote.”
USC students had the opportunity to take this step at the event, where tables were set up for voter registration.
“I was pleasantly surprised by the event’s large turnout, and hope that it helps to engage millennial voters,” said Elisabeth Hopkins, a senior majoring in biomedical engineering.
The USC Annenberg Center on Communication Leadership & Policy and the USC Jesse M. Unruh Institute of Politics will co-host two more debate-viewing events this campaign season, for the vice presidential debate and the next presidential debate on Oct. 4 and Oct. 19, respectively.

There’s a lot of things that matter to us college students — parties, tailgates, football, grades(?), sleep, Netflix — and the most important of all: Food. Food is everything. But, what’s even more important to us? Cheap food. 
The sad side-effect of said ‘cheap food, however, is that often the cheaper the food is more unhealthy. Now, this isn’t always a bad thing, let’s be real. It’s in those rare occasions when you’re walking between classes, see someone eating some kind of salad or wrap, and vaguely remember the far-off land wherein your parents used to cook, feed and enforce vegetables into your diet. 
Perhaps they were right after all?
Luckily, USC has once again got us covered! And although we may be in an eternal wait for the new Village to open, revealing to us the long-awaited, highly-anticipated Trader Joe’s, we can still find a fresh vegetable or two here on campus.
So here it is — your much needed (whether you know it or not) guide to the healthiest food at USC:

Lemonade — if you’re brave enough to join the long line that forms every day around 11:30-2pm, you’ll find yourself some delicious seasonal variations of pasta salads, vegetables, protein and leafy greens, as well as some soups, sandwiches, drinks (and maybe some cake? what?)

Literatea – many people don’t know about Literatea, located in the back of Doheny Library, and even those that do don’t always know about their small but delicious food offerings. Not only do they have cheap tea and coffee (goodbye TroGro line), but they also have super cheap and tasty oatmeal every morning until 11am, as well as toasted sandwiches and a fridge selection with fruits and wraps!

Fertitta Cafe — the new Jill and Frank Fertitta Hall has a cafe located on the first floor and it’s been popular! The predominantly Asian cuisine cafe serves a range of healthy food, from Salads, to Rice Bowls, to Sushi and even a cheeky dumpling or three!
 
 
Even though USC has a great provision of healthy and diverse food, don’t be scared to venture off campus! The nearby vicinity of campus also has a lot to offer in terms of nourishment, taste and affordability, so be sure to check it out!

The No. 2 USC women’s golf team has begun its 2016 season this week by competing at the ANNIKA Intercollegiate in Orlando, Florida, which began on Sunday and will wrap up Tuesday. Through 36 holes played at Reunion Resort on Sunday and Monday, USC is currently tied with No. 22 South Carolina for fourth place in the team standings at 12-under.
The Women of Troy entered Monday’s second round tied for third place in the team standings, but ultimately fell to fourth after recording a team score of 3-under; they were passed by Georgia who finished with a round two team-score of 9-under on Monday.
As an individual, redshirt senior Victoria Morgan was a team-best 3-under in Monday’s round two. Overall, Morgan is tied for 12th at the tournament with a score of 5-under through the first 36 holes.
“I was just hitting the ball really well out there [Monday], I think I only missed like one green,” Morgan said. “My putting was kind of off, but I made things easier on myself because I was hitting the ball so straight.”
Play at the ANNIKA was temporarily delayed on Tuesday due to disruptive weather conditions. Several players’ rounds were interrupted mid-hole and halted until conditions improved — this was the case for Morgan.
“I had a six-foot birdie shot coming, and I marked my ball … but then the horns blew and I had to go inside before I could finish,” Morgan said regarding the delay. “I was stressing about that putt for like an hour-and-a-half, but I ended up making it; so it’s all good.”
Also tied with Morgan for 12th place (-5) in the tournament standings is senior Tiffany Chan. After scoring 5-under in the opening round on Sunday, Chan finished with a round two score of par. Senior Gabriella Then is tied for 20th (-3), while sophomore Robyn Ree is tied for 34th (+1). After scoring one-over in both rounds one and two, senior Karen Chung is tied for 36th (+2) in the player standings.
USC (-12), is 13 strokes behind tournament-leading UCLA (-25) in the team standings entering Tuesday’s final round of play.
“Our goal was to win out here, and it still is,” Morgan said. “Our team has an incredible amount of talent; the five players that we have here are capable of shooting some really low numbers on any given day, so if we all bring our game [Tuesday] there’s no reason we can’t come back.”
The team begins final round play Tuesday morning with South Carolina and Florida.

Senior men’s tennis player Rob Bellamy grinded his way to a title at the Battle in the Bay singles competition on Sunday in San Francisco.
Bellamy, who earned a bye in the Round of 64, defeated Pepperdine’s Gabriel Sidney in the Round of 32 on Friday and Portland’s Mathieu Garcia in the Round of 16 on Saturday. His quarterfinal opponent, top-ranked Florian Lakat of Cal, withdrew from the match, giving Bellamy a spot in the semifinals on Sunday, where he defeated San Diego State’s Marko Goles Babic 2-0 with a tiebreak win in the second set.
In the title match against Cal Poly’s Ben Donovan, Bellamy pulled out a three-set win, claiming the first set in a tiebreaker and the decisive third set, 6-4.
Bellamy entered the season with a 40-17 overall record in singles play. He also won the Aztec Invitational Championships in both singles and doubles during the 2013-2014 season.
He was one of four players that USC sent to San Francisco over the weekend, while four others participated in the John Breaux Tennis Classic.
Brandon Holt and Riley Smith, both freshmen, advanced to the doubles final in the Battle in the Bay, but fell 8-6 to Cal Poly’s Donovan and Corey Pang. Holt also advanced to the semifinals in singles play, where Donovan defeated him in three sets.
The Trojans’ deepest run in Louisiana was a trip to the doubles semifinal by sophomore Jack Jaede and junior Thibault Forget, but they were upended by the top-seeded duo Jordan Daigle and Justin Butsch of LSU.
It’s still early in USC’s fall slate of tournaments, as the team’s only other competition was the Napa Challenge last weekend. Next up for the Trojans is ITA All-American Championships; the prequalifying events begin on Saturday.

USC has opened the season by going 1-3, its worst start in 15 years, since 2001, ironically the same year that a relatively unknown and unproven Pete Carroll got his shot as a Trojan. Flash forward several years, and USC is in a place it hasn’t been for some time, and not in a good way.
Nick Entin | Daily TrojanGetting JuJu involved · Junior wide receiver JuJu Smith-Schuster’s turns upfield after a reception against Utah State. He had just four combined catches against Alabama and Stanford, but caught eight passes last Friday.
Just four games into the season, the season is already filled with an air of desperation and hopelessness in which the team must win five of their remaining eight games in order to be comfortably in bowl eligibility.
USC is 1-6 in its last seven games against Power-5 opponents, the losses from this season being Friday’s 31-27 meltdown against Utah, the previous week’s 27-10 loss at Stanford and the season opening 52-6 blowout at the hands of Alabama. Additionally, the Trojans lost in the Holiday Bowl last December to Wisconsin, 23-21; lost to Stanford again in the Pac-12 Championship game, 41-22 and lost at Oregon in November, 48-28. The lone victory in the last seven games against Power-5 opponents was a 40-21 victory over UCLA in the Coliseum last November.
Since November 14, the Trojans have only won two games: The win over UCLA last season and the single victory this year being a 45-7 trouncing of an inferior Utah State team.
Head coach Clay Helton is 1-5 as a full time head coach, and with USC’s recent penchant for short leashes with football coaches, media members and fans alike are beginning to speculate how long USC will ride the Helton wave.
The Trojans are currently last in the Pac-12 in scoring offense, averaging just 22.0 points per game. The leader, Arizona State, which USC will face next week, is averaging 48.8 points per game. USC is ninth in both rushing offense and passing offense.
USC has not scored a touchdown against a ranked opponent on a pass. The Trojans have only scored four touchdowns against ranked opponents, and all have been on the ground. On the season, USC has 10 total touchdowns, tied for second to last with Oregon State and ahead of only Stanford.
Through the offensive struggles, the Trojans have used two different quarterbacks. Redshirt junior Max Browne was named the starter to begin the season and after the offense sputtered through three games, Helton switched over to redshirt freshman Sam Darnold.
In his first start (Friday’s game against Utah), Darnold went 18-26 for 253 yards, running for 41 yards and one touchdown. Darnold targeted top wide receiver junior JuJu Smith-Schuster and connected for eight catches totaling 98 yards. Darnold was the spark the offense was looking for, but only to a certain extent.
The offense fumbled the ball three times — Darnold fumbled once — which was a contributing factor in time of possession. Utah had possession of the football for 15 more minutes than the Trojans. This directly influenced the ability of the defense to perform because they were constantly on the field.
After the loss to Stanford, graduate transfer defensive end Stevie Tu’ikolovatu spoke about the defensive unit’s frustration.
“It’s frustrating staying on the field when we know we should be off,” Tu’ikolovatu said.
Defensively, USC is still in the lower half with its defense ranking seventh overall. For rush and pass defense, the Trojans are 10th and sixth, respectively. The team is also tied for fewest interceptions this season, with only three.
In fact, of all the offensive and defensive team statistics, USC is only in the top half of the conference in pass defense, kickoff returns (3) and punt returns (1). Junior cornerback and return specialist Adoree’ Jackson is directly involved in all three.

It only took five minutes for defender Kayla Mills to find fellow senior Morgan Andrews in the box against the University of North Carolina. An arching corner kick and a flick of a header sent the ball into the back of the net, kicking off a 3-0 upset for one of the top teams in the country.
Both players have found their rhythm in their final seasons as Trojans, and with that rhythm has come serious attention from across the country. This summer, both Mills and Andrews were named to a watch list of 36 players for this year’s MAC Hermann trophy.
The distinction sets Mills and Andrews apart as some of the greatest college players in the country. But for the two seniors, this final season is about much more than personal achievements.
The MAC Hermann award is to college soccer what the Heisman is to football. Recent winners include World Cup champions like Morgan Brian, Crystal Dunn, Christen Press, Kelley O’Hara and Mia Hamm.
So, it came as a slight surprise to both Mills and Andrews this summer when their phones lit up with texts from friends congratulating them on the distinction.
“It’s the greatest honor any collegiate soccer player can earn,” Andrews said. “When you look at the people who have come before, who have won it in the past, it’s pretty incredible to even be considered on that level.”
But the news came as no surprise to head coach Keidane McAlpine that Mills and Andrews stood out on a national level. In their years at USC, both players have come through on and off the field as McAlpine shaped his young program.
“It’s a true testament to the level of respect that they’ve earned throughout their time here,” McAlpine said. “It’s a huge step forward for them and for our program. But I think, for those who see them practicing and working day in and day out, it’s something we get to see every day. These are world- class players.”
In a well-spread offense that finds scoring opportunities with a variety of players, Andrews has already netted three goals this year, including the opening point against the University of North Carolina. Moving up to midfielder after spending last year on the defense, Mills connected to assist two of those three goals.
It’s a chemistry that McAlpine has seen develop over the past two years of playing together. And it’s a relationship that has been growing for most of the years that Mills and Andrews have played soccer.
The two first met in the U.S. national team system when they were 14 years old. They played with and against each other off and on throughout their high school careers, until Mills became a Trojan and Andrews headed to Notre Dame. Two years later, Andrews transferred to USC and the two became everyday teammates, both for the Trojans and for the U.S. U-23 team.
Though they only played together on a daily basis for the past two years, spending eight years as teammates has formed a bond of trust and respect between the two seniors.
“I love playing next to her,” Andrews said. “We’ve worked off of each other well. Honestly, she’s just one of the best players I’ve ever seen play. She makes it fun to play alongside her.”
Earning a spot on the watch list had a mixed effect on Mills and Andrews. On one hand, it bolstered their confidence, confirming that they are among the top players in the country. Of course, it wasn’t the first confirmation of their status among the best of the best — Mills was named the top youth defender in the country by TopDrawer in August, and Andrews was ranked among the top five midfielders in the same report.
It also created a pressure to perform among the best.
“I think I always expect the best of myself, whether I’m on a list or whether I’m not,” Mills said. “That pressure comes from myself, from wanting to be my best for my team. And that’s on and off the field. If I need to be the best at cheering on the sidelines, that’s what I’m going to do, and I’m always going to put that pressure on myself.”
As Mills and Andrews head into their final regular season at USC, however, personal accolades are the last thing on their minds. Mills approaches each game with the mindset of contributing as much as she can to the team, in whatever way she is needed, whether that means sitting on the bench or playing every second.
This feeling is echoed by Andrews. Her goals for the season are simple yet difficult to execute: Win a Pac-12 championship, and follow it up with an NCAA championship. It won’t be easy. The last time they won the national championship was in 2007, and the Trojans have never taken a solo Pac-12 title.
Andrews never shies away from saying that the team is a contender for the national championship. If the MAC Hermann trophy comes along the way, so be it. But for both Mills and Andrews, the team is more important than anything else.
“There’s no such thing as an individual when you’re playing with 11 people on the field,” Andrews said. “If I win any accolade or if I’m on any list, it’s because of the girls around me. Everyone wants everyone next to them to succeed. It doesn’t matter who puts the ball in the back of the net as long as we win the game.”

Right now, being a USC fan is pretty hard. It was quite a task on Friday night as the team lost to Utah. To say it’s been difficult over the last couple seasons would be an understatement, but just because it’s been hard, doesn’t mean Trojan fans should stop supporting their team.
Tal Volk | Daily TrojanNo hot seat yet · On Saturday, head coach Clay Helton said he talked to and has the support of Athletic Director Lynn Swann (above).
It may not be as enjoyable as when the team only lost nine games in a span of seven seasons, but still, as a fan you should be with the team through thick and thin.
You’ll see it on Twitter and Facebook — a plethora of Trojan fans threaten to stop supporting the team or that they’re done being loyal. To even propose the idea doesn’t really make them true supporters.
By all means, fans can criticize the team and expect more from them. Notre Dame head coach Brian Kelly made a comment last week that if the fans aren’t upset with the team’s poor start, than they aren’t really fans at all. So yes, USC fans should be disappointed in the Trojans’ 1-3 start. This isn’t how a USC team is supposed to start their season. There was promise in young talent this season, but some of that promise is still there.
Redshirt freshman quarterback Sam Darnold looked impressive against Utah. He showed spurts of talent that, with a bit more experience, could make him a great quarterback. If anything, he was the team’s bright spot against the Utes. That and the fact that junior wide receiver JuJu Smith-Schuster tallied up 98 yards in the game, just one yard shy of his season total and in two less catches. Darnold was able to inject a life into USC’s disorganized, lackluster offense. But, just because Darnold was behind center, doesn’t mean that their offensive problems were fixed.
It’s crazy to think that a running back who was averaging 12.6 yards per carry didn’t touch the ball in the fourth quarter while the other two backs averaged less than six yards combined. That’s nothing against the other two backs, it’s just that senior Justin Davis was having quite a night. It’s on the coaching staff for not putting him in. Head coach Clay Helton claimed that there’s a rotation and they “trust their backs.” While that’s great, you would have to be blind not to see that Davis was tearing up the Utah defense and not putting him in was a disservice to the Trojans’ offense.
Fans should opine on these decisions by the coaches to literally stray from what was working and try something else that was continually not working. It’s mid-game adjustments like that that the staff can’t quite seem to get themselves around this season.
Fans can do more than criticize, though. They can be upset, and rightfully so. USC has the talent to be better than this; they should be better than this.
After LSU fired head coach Les Miles, almost immediately, tweets popped up on my Twitter feed calling for Athletic Director Lynn Swann to fire Helton and offer Miles a job. If anything, USC does not need another coaching change in the middle of the season. Three times in four seasons is just ridiculous.
I may be in the minority, but Helton should remain the head coach of USC for the entirety of the season. After the Trojans’ final game of 2016, whether that be against UCLA at the Rose Bowl or at a bowl game, Swann can sit down, assess the team’s standing and — if he deems it necessary — look for another head coach.
USC fans, whether they back Helton or not, should support the Trojans the rest of the season. Against Utah, the players, pretty much as a whole, looked fired up and played like a different team than the one that lost to Alabama and Stanford. True fans owe it to the players to support the team this season, no matter what.
Jodee Storm Sullivan is a junior majoring in broadcast and digital journalism. Her column, “The Storm Report,” runs Tuesdays.
If Mr. Swann waits until the end of the season to fire Helton, the pool of available coaches may be limited.  If Les Miles is interested in coaching at USC, take him immediately and fire Helton.    This would be in the best interest of the school and the football team.

For some people, certain artists can do no wrong, no matter what crazy things they do. Michael Jackson dangled his baby off of a balcony, but he’s still the king of pop. Taylor Swift’s personality is as fake as that Southern accent that she’s mysteriously seemed to lose over the years, but I’ll be damned if I don’t sing along to “Our Song” every time it comes on the radio. Britney Spears shaved her head and went off the deep end for a bit, but at this point, that’s just something we laugh fondly about. Kanye West — well, take your pick. But to put it bluntly, despite how you feel about him, he’s one of the greatest artists music has ever seen.
Photo courtesy of RCA RecordsBringing sexy back · After a seven-year hiatus, Justin Timberlake returned to the music scene with his album, The 20/20 Experience. The album was nominated for Best Pop Vocal Album at the Grammys in 2014.
However, there are some artists who have avoided scandals like the plague despite being in the limelight. One of these artists has had a career that would last anyone two lifetimes, but he’s not done. To watch him grow as an artist while I grew up is something truly special, something that my mom and dad probably had with Michael Jackson. For me, instead of the king, I got the prince of pop: Justin Timberlake.
In my eyes, this man can do no wrong. The closest he’s come to a scandal was when he and Britney Spears split, which spawned the greatest breakup anthem of all time, “Cry Me a River.” The different stages in his career have always coincided with different stages of mine. In NSYNC, he was there in my pre-school and kindergarten days with “Bye Bye Bye” and many other hits that made choosing between his group and the Backstreet Boys as hard as choosing one child over another. When I was in elementary school, he dropped Justified, and proved that he wasn’t just the most popular one out of a boy band; he was a genuine star with phenomenal talent and had the foresight to team up with the up-and-coming producers, The Neptunes. He helped me get through my awkward middle school years when he brought sexy back after dropping FutureSex/LoveSounds, also finding the perfect union with, arguably, the greatest pop producer of all time, Timbaland.
But when the world was ready to see what he could do next, his music career stepped out of the spotlight, taking a hiatus that gave me an empty feeling whenever I listened to the radio. Other artists like Lady Gaga were getting ready to show the world what they could do, but there was something missing for me. Without even a hint of an album after years of occasional guest appearances on songs and some really funny SNL bits, I assumed Justin Timberlake was done, and my favorite pop artist had decided to call it quits.
During one particularly bitter winter in my junior year of high school, my good friend Billy sent me a message on Facebook with a link to a Justin Timberlake song I had never heard before. I assumed at first that this was another song he made a guest appearance on, but I was wrong. The song started with a juxtaposition of Timberlake’s tenor voice mixed with a bass voice, a harp and a deep-sounding horn section. The beat then transitioned to a faster tempo and sounded as if Frank Sinatra’s orchestra played a modern-pop sound but still kept their jazzy and swinging spirit, and Justin’s voice jumped in and out of gorgeous multi-layered harmonies, showing that after all these years, age hadn’t slowed him down a bit.
“Suit and Tie,” I soon learned, was his first single off of his new album, The 20/20 Experience. I felt like I had another birthday that month. It wouldn’t be until March that the full album dropped, but I was ecstatic to see my old friend come back again, and I couldn’t wait to discover what new sound he had in store.
The 20/20 Experience is the product of a more mature, developed Justin Timberlake who is determined to completely shed the previous image of being just a pretty face you’re used to seeing on the Teen Choice Awards and Us Weekly. You only have to listen to the production of the first song on the album, “Pusher Love Girl,” to know that this isn’t the same Justin Timberlake that took a hiatus all those years ago; this is an older Justin Timberlake that puts meticulous thought into his craft to have such a redefined and vast sound. The gorgeous orchestration that accompanies Justin’s voice throughout the song gives it an air of sophistication that gives it a soulful feeling.
This sophisticated and soulful sound is the backbone of the album, giving many songs like “Strawberry Bubblegum,” “Spaceship Coupe,” “That Girl” and, of course, “Suit and Tie,” their charm. Other songs, like “Mirrors,” “Let the Groove Get In” and “Don’t Hold the Wall” have a more traditional Justin Timberlake pop sound to them, but with the added benefit of a having a more experienced approach to them. The pop veteran is able to place his harmonized vocals in all the right places to complement the hard-hitting percussion of Timbaland’s beats without oversaturating the songs with his voice.
The most important thing about this album is that Timberlake dared to be innovative, and it paid off in spades. One of my favorite tracks on the album, “Blue Ocean Floor,” is surreal in the way that its minimalist vocals and production are able to pack so much emotion and depth; a lot is said in this song without being explicitly stated, and I always find one more thing that I love about the song every time I listen to it. Whether I’m driving late at night or lying down in a dark room with all the lights turned off, this song never fails to put my mind in a calmer place. If a stranger told me years ago that the same guy who was on the top of the charts with “Rock Your Body” were to make a song, much less an album, like this, I would have thought that my mom was actually right when she said I shouldn’t talk to strangers.
This album was everything I hoped for and more in a new Justin Timberlake album. The prince of pop had regained his rightful throne, and winter was slowly giving way to spring, making everything right again. In a poetic sense, Justin Timberlake had been reborn in a season of new beginnings. His boyish charm that I became familiar with as a kid became more mature, which was something that I could appreciate since I had done a small amount of maturing myself at that point. This album also coincidentally hit its heyday around the time of my first prom, so the whole theme of class really hit home and solidified the fact that Justin Timberlake can do no wrong in my eyes. He’s had a perfect career, but I can’t wait to see what he does next. His next few albums might not be as strong, and he may have already hit the high point of his career, but as of now, hindsight is 20/20.

Couldn’t agree more. 20/20 is by far his strongest and most impressive album.
Side note: I may never understand the fascination for Justified. In my opinion, his absolute weakest solo album. Incredibly thankful he got away from Pharrell for the next three records.

Playwright, novelist, activist and part of TIME’s “100 Innovators for the Next New Wave,” Suzan-Lori Parks will spend an evening at USC next Thursday night. USC Visions and Voices and the USC School of Dramatic Arts bring Parks to campus as a part of a Visions and Voices Signature Event to discuss Parks’ acclaimed work with a book signing and reception to follow. The discussion will focus on how Parks uses her work to provide a modern lens on American history by covering issues of race and identity within her stories.
Photo courtesy of Suzan-Lori BanksThe right play · Suzan-Lori Parks became the first black woman to win a Pulitzer Prize for her 2001 play Topdog/Underdog. She is also known for co-writing the screen adaptation of Their Eyes Were Watching God.
Suzan-Lori Parks is best known for her work on the Broadway revival of Porgy and Bess, which won a Tony for Best Revival of a Musical in 2012. Porgy and Bess is a folk opera written by George Gershwin, DuBose Heyward and Ira Gershwin in 1934. The story is set in 1930s Charleston South Carolina, in an African-American neighborhood, focusing on a love story between a crippled man, Porgy, and a beautiful woman named Bess.
Parks, along with director Diane Paulus, made many changes to adapt the show for a modern audience, taking into account that the show has many racists remarks and songs and writing around them. While there was much controversy about the changes made, with Broadway legend Stephen Sondheim sending a letter to the editor of The New York Times heavily criticizing the revival, Parks stands strongly by her work, claiming that the idea wasn’t to copy the old opera, but create something new.
“What we did is — you know on your computer, you push duplicate? We’re making another show,” Parks told NPR in 2011. “We’re not saying, ‘This will replace the original, brilliant opera called Porgy and Bess.’ And again, the Gershwins asked us to.”
Parks is also well known her Pulitzer Prize-winning show, Topdog/Underdog, which made her the first African-American woman to be awarded a Pulitzer Prize for Drama. The thought-provoking play is about two African-American men named Lincoln and Booth who learn to be con men on the streets, and touches on themes of racism, family and healing. Other notable plays of hers include 365 Days/365 Plays, where Parks wrote a play every day for a year, In the Blood, Venus, Imperceptible Mutabilities in the Third Kingdom and, her newest play, Father Comes Home From the Wars (Parts 1, 2 & 3). Father Comes Home From the Wars is a Civil War piece from a modern perspective, combining music with drama as it tells a story of America, belonging and internal battles. It alludes greatly to Homer’s Odyssey, following the epic, three-part journey of a slave finding freedom in the South. The play opened at the Public Theater in New York City in 2014, and since then has gained much critical acclaim, with Parks winning the 2014 Horton Foote Prize and the 2015 Edward M. Kennedy Prize for Drama, in addition to being named a a Pulitzer Prize finalist.
The discussion will be moderated by Luis Alfaro, a playwright and professor at the USC School of Dramatic Arts. The event will take place Oct. 6 at 7 p.m. in Town and Gown and is free with an RSVP through the USC Visions and Voices website.

BANKS is expected to take listeners on an emotional journey in her upcoming album, set to be released on Sept. 30.
Photo courtesy of Harvest RecordsMaking BANKS · Jillian Banks, a USC alumna, has garnered praise for her debut album Goddess. The R&B and alternative singer’s new album will include the singles “F-ck With Myself” and “To the Hilt.”
After receiving overwhelmingly positive feedback for her debut album, alt-pop singer BANKS will release her second album, The Altar, through Harvest Records. This album will be her second following her debut album, Goddess, which was released in 2014. BANKS is known to blur the lines between various genres, including R&B, pop, synth, hip-hop and alternative.
Listeners can expect her trademark sound in the 13 tracks on the upcoming album, but with fresh, new meanings and concepts behind the songs. Speaking about the differences between her first and second album, BANKS said in an interview with i-D, “My music is different in the way that I am different; it’s like I have gone through a lot of new things — new relationships, new obstacles, new experiences, and I think I put that all into my music.”
The Altar features confessional, bold songs about the confrontation behind human interaction. Not only does the album explore themes about relationships, but it is also about self-understanding and discovery. Having struggled with depression, BANKS views her music as a diary and outlet. The story of her struggle between self-hate and self-love is a recurring theme throughout her album and is presented notably in the lead single, “F-ck with Myself.”
“I feel more comfortable being confrontational and authoritative,” BANKS said in an interview with NPR Music “It’s important for women in this business.”
As a proponent of female empowerment, BANKS sends her messages through the emotional honesty of her lyrics. BANKS strives to express her own experiences and connect with listeners in the vulnerability behind each track on The Altar.
The lead single of the album, “F-ck with Myself,” was released in July. BANKS appeared on Zane Lowe’s Beats 1 Radio Show to debut the new single and music video.
“There’s so many meanings to it,” she told Lowe of the track. “It could be like, ‘I f-ck with myself,’ like, ‘I mess with myself more than anybody else.’ It could be, ‘I f-ck with myself,’ kind of like, ‘I’m feeling myself.’ It means a lot of different things that I think a lot of people can relate to.”
The music video features dramatic scenes of masked dancers abstractly twisting their bodies around her and of BANKS putting lipstick on and toying with a look-alike mannequin. Its eerie mood matches with the soft but powerful rhythm of the song as well as its notions of empowerment.
The second and third singles on The Altar have likewise also been released; “Gemini Feed,” the second single on the album, premiered on Annie Mac’s BBC Radio 1 show on Aug. 2 and released digitally the following day. “Mind Games” was released a few weeks later. Both tracks stay consistent with the theme of collapsed relationships — a common thread throughout the album.
The Altar is expected to be more nuanced than Goddess, but BANKS’ signature style along with the relatability of the album promise that each song will move and assure listeners that both the darkness and positivity explored in the album are universally experienced.

This month, a University of Richmond fraternity was suspended after an email surfaced containing offensive, predatory language and veiled threats toward female students. The issue has unsurprisingly called into question the behavior of men in Greek life and the promotion of rape culture across college campuses. Though any organization may choose to pursue its own self interests, problems arise when these self interests are achieved by exploiting another group, in this case, women. However important it is to draw attention to such inappropriate behavior, the reaction of women in these situations must also be addressed.
Such behavior by fraternities is often publicly denounced as unacceptable — luckily, this email included. But still, weekend after weekend, fraternities host parties with similar suggestive themes and succeed in attracting crowds of young women. When invited to a situation so clearly created by men, for men, a clear reason remains to explain why female students would continue to attend. Women attend fraternity parties despite their misogynistic nature because, as our society has demanded, they have trained themselves to feel safe in these environments, while being unconsciously pressured to accept or ignore sexist behavior. Again, a simple solution to a large and complex problem exists — put greek parties on women’s terms. The Panhellenic Council needs to allow sororities to host at their own houses.
It seems that women are adept and experienced at enjoying themselves in these situations created for men to enjoy. However, it is often impossible for women to feel at ease. Female attendees continue to travel to parties in groups of trusted friends, watch their drinks being made, keep their cups in eyesight all night and give out  fake phone numbers when men won’t take no for an answer. It has become so ingrained in campus culture for women to act this way that they take these precautions without even recognizing that they are directly responding to the potential danger.
Women have also adapted to filter media written by men. When the details contain threats of sexual assault, claiming that the party is the type that “makes fathers afraid to send their daughters away to school,” it is troubling to think that women would still attend.
However, on a campus where greek life is dominant and loud, where parties like that at University of Richmond are a part of every weekend, language like that present in the University of Richmond fraternity email is not uncommon to hear in daily life. After some time, women often disregard these comments and behaviors with an eye roll or a scoff, no longer taking it seriously. It seems like the age-old saying “boys will be boys” carries an implicit message that girls should be girls — meaning they should play their part in such situations and ignore sexist messages or play along. It is seemingly suggested that women should not only accept the sexist behavior, but they should also be willing partakers in the gendered role assignment. Young women are not unaware of this sexism that persists on campuses across the nation. But they’re certainly pressured to ignore it in the context of a party scene.
The actions of fraternities are self-motivated and taken to benefit or please the men in the organization. With sororities unable to throw their own parties like fraternities can, there is no model for a similar party situation created by women, for women. Allowing sororities to have alcohol in their houses, though currently banned by individual National Panhellenic Council chapters, is a potential solution to this issue. This way, sororities could host their own parties instead of feeling pressured to attend the fraternity parties. By delegating specific rules for women in Greek life that don’t apply to men, the system is limiting women’s independence and forcing them to outsource for parties. This is not a call to end all fraternity parties, but rather a proposal for more the creation of more options for women, for equal treatment and rules for men and women in Greek life. The freedom to throw parties on their own terms and in their own home — choosing the guests, the drinks and the themes — could create a safer environment for women.
Many wonder why a fraternity would showcase a blatant sexist attitude toward women in a widely distributed email. Ultimately, this is because they know it won’t change the outcome of their events. Men objectify and sexualize women, and women still attend their parties. A preliminary step to addressing sexism in Greek life is understanding the willingness with which women choose to participate in these events and the many different factors that can influence this. The next step is taking action to create a more progressive environment in which women have no reason to fear for their safety — because, for the first time, they are in control of a once-predatory environment.

Forty-two days from today you will wake up to headlines announcing our next President of the United States of America. Beyond a countdown, 42 also represents the percentage of 18-24 year olds registered to vote in 2014 — the lowest figure in over forty years. Political apathy at its highest.
Elizabeth Gu | Daily Trojan
But Nov. 8 is about more than picking our next president. This election cycle, voters in California have the opportunity to take the future of our state into our own hands. This year’s ballot will give you the opportunity to pick our next Senator, vote on the legalization of marijuana and voice your opinion on prescription drug prices, among much more. There are 17 statewide ballot propositions, affordable housing and mass transit county initiatives, in addition to our local races.
The millennial generation has power in numbers. As of April, over 69 million millennials are eligible to vote. We choose to give up this power when we decide not to participate in the political process. It is not enough to post a Facebook status stating your displeasure with a candidate or a policy. Likes and comments don’t make a difference — votes do.
Our generation has the power to shape policy, ignite conversations and bring youth issues to the table for discussion. However, in 2014, only 19.9 of 18-29 year olds voted, a historically low number for our age group.
Our councilmember, Curren D. Price, Jr, won his 2013 election with 5,184 votes. The election was decided by less than 550 votes. As students, we are 43,000 strong. We have the power to decide who can represent us and what issues they need to be talking about.
This year, voter registration is a major focus area for our student government. USC Undergraduate Student Government is teaming up with the Unruh Insitute of Politics to roll out registration efforts from now until Oct. 24, the registration deadline. Our goal is to register at least 2,000 students and give them the power to make a difference.
Today we are kicking off voter registration with our National Voter Registration Drive at Tommy Trojan. Over the next four weeks, we will be registering students at events, in their dorms and online. As students we need to recognize the power of our collective action. That starts with registering to vote
Don’t tell me that you want change but then stay home on Election Day. If you don’t vote on Tuesday, you are waiving your right to complain on Wednesday.
It is time for our generation to step up and take action. Let’s not be the leaders of tomorrow, let’s register, vote and make a difference today.
We have four weeks to enact change. Join us by registering to vote today at bit.ly/TrojansVote, and help us spread the word.
Edwin Saucedo
USG President

The USC Thornton Symphony performed music inspired by the world of dance Friday evening in Bovard Auditorium, as part of their “Dance as Music” concert. Led by resident conductor Sharon Lavery, the orchestra performed Igor Stravinsky’s “Petrushka” and Maurice Ravel’s “Bolero.”
Stravinsky’s composed his ballet “Petrushhka” following his successful and well-recognized ballet “The Firebird.” Perhaps one of his slightly lesser-known works in the shadows of “The Rite of Spring” and “The Firebird.” If there is anything that would identify Stravinsky it was his drive to be untraditional and to break musical boundaries. Stravinsky’s “Petrushhka” follows the same signature tell tale signs that undoubtedly make it Stravinsky.
“Petrushhka” opened with a dissonant soundscape. Expressing the characteristics of Stravinsky’s modernist lack of harmony, the symphony was able to precisely pin down the style of Stravinsky in the piece. Often more demanding than Stravinsky’s typical melody-based pieces, “Petrushka” is highlighted by a winding path of musical motifs and untraditional lack of familiar recurring themes. Stravinsky’s work is easily handled by the orchestra’s technical proficiencies. The attention to detail in the highly detailed score shows the high level of musicianship and proficiency for the symphony musicians. They were able to make very principled efforts out of Stravinsky’s jumbled mess. Detailed solos throughout the piece were able to balance well with the fabric of the piece.
Ravels “Bolero,” based on a single theme repeated and manipulated throughout, like many fine crafts, cannot be quickly performed. What was considered a rather garish ballet piece by critics to the restrained world of classical music, “Bolero” can become a carefully performed spectacle or bloated mess. The Thornton Symphony musicians seemed to understand the underlying balance and musical phrasing required to make the performance a successful one.
The piece started with a subtle opening with careful execution of the main theme by the flute and clarinet sections. As the piece progressed, the various sections of the orchestra entered with perfect balance and phrasing. The piece especially highlighted the orchestra’s ability to balance and comprehend both the large themes and subtlety of the details. The piece gained more energy and emotion at exactly the right points in the piece.
Ravel looked upon “Bolero” as an experimentation and a piece with little effect on the greater world of serious music. However, it is probably safe to say that even seemingly simple pieces can have large meanings. The performance was the ultimate  “less is more” showcase, executed by an orchestra which understood, and not simply performed, Bolero’s musical concepts well.
The Thornton Symphony’s next performance will be Oct. 14 at 7:30 p.m. in Bovard Auditorium. The “New Music for Orchestra” concert will showcase new orchestral works by Thornton student composers.

There’s a strange phenomenon I recently learned about: when women take up 17% of a room, men firmly believe that there’s an equal presence of the sexes. And when 33% of the people in a room are women, men think that the women are the overwhelming majority.
What could be an explanation for these instances? I’ve recently learned about some lesser known, underlying statistics that keep cropping up when we look at gender ratios and representation in media and films. The ratio of men to women in family movies is 3:1, and of the characters with careers, an overwhelming 81% are male. And the most shocking number of all: in most crowd scenes, women only make up 17% of the cast. There is no clear-cut 50/50 representation of women and men when you observe virtually any statistic across the board for media portrayal. In our tech-infused world, there is no denying that from our beginning steps, we begin to gradually absorb the media around us — whether it be from the children’s TV shows we grow up watching, the G-rated kid-friendly movies of later childhood, or the Hollywood blockbusters that we eagerly await every summer — and that this reinforces subconscious biases over the years through the power of repeated imagery. 
But what’s truly troubling are the other areas in which the 17% statistic becomes apparent: in Congress, on Fortune 500 boards, law partner ratios, and tenured professors. At USC, aggregated data shows that from 1998-2012, though 92% of white males in Dornsife were awarded tenure, only 55% of women and minorities became tenured. Even though the two scopes — female presence in films we watch growing up, and women in professional leadership roles — seem unrelated, it’s no wonder there’s a vast divide, when from our youth, the 17% pattern is imprinted subconsciously onto us and standardized to be the norm. As a child grows up and such a norm becomes more and more ingrained into what he or she expects to be represented in society over the years, the biases that are developed may be indirect, but have profound consequences. Back to my earlier example — the gender imbalance, stuck at 17%, becomes so normalized, that men intuitively perceive that the 17% of women in the room somehow equals 50% of those present. 
Beyond calling for a greater presence of women in the film industry and urging prominent directors to take a stand for equal representation in media, I think there are steps we can take in our daily encounters that can counteract the gender biases that have affected all our perceptions of society. I want to encourage everyone, especially my male friends, to be conscious of the gender balances in a room and whether enough women are being incorporated in the current conversation. Right now, we’re lucky enough to be at an elite university in which classroom gender ratios are equal, more or less (not including STEM-related areas), but in the working world, when looking at positions of authority and leadership, women only hold a quarter of managerial positions. Let’s all try to be aware of the discrepancies, keep our unconscious biases in check, and challenge the status quo. 
Am I missing the links to sources and the works cited list?
Identity politics, progressive activism, and the like are what’s cool in collegiate culture. The UC schools spearheaded this movement since the 1960s. And many other universities across the country followed suit. I guess since USC was stereotyped as a WASPy, elitist school…with mediocre academics, for so long, that now they want to turn a new leaf and copy what the “cool and intellectual” schools do.
