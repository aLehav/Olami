The NBA Finals are behind us, with Steph Curry and the Golden State Warriors reaching yet another championship title. The Stanley Cup Finals are waning and could see the Tampa Bay Lightning down three games by the time these words hit the press. Some sports fans might lament the sudden shortage of playoff excitement that summer seems to always bring. However, in Los Angeles, such a shortage doesn’t exist. As the summer reaches its halfway point, here are three ways to keep up with the action. 
Go watch the Angels play before they skip town
The city of Anaheim has had its hands full this season after the FBI exposed corruption within an agreement to finance a new stadium for the L.A. Angels, forcing the resignation of mayor Harry Sidhu. With the recent legal developments, the Angels’ long-term plans in Anaheim could be up in the air. Fortunately, the Angels are still only a trek to Orange County away, and with tickets as low as $12 it might be worth it to check out the aptly named Angel Stadium of Anaheim. 
Despite the off-the-field (but about the field) controversies and a franchise-record 14-game losing streak, the Angels are still in the middle of an attention-worthy season. The Angels sit second in the AL West and sixth in the AL Wild Card standings. Their upcoming series against the Chicago White Sox, who have a half-game over the Angels in the Wild Card, could set a tone for the remainder of the season. With Shohei Ohtani, winner of the AL MVP last season, and Mike Trout, perhaps one of the greatest baseball players of all time, the Angels are certainly worth a watch IRL this summer. 
Cheer on the Sparks in Crypto.com Arena 
The NBA season didn’t pan out the way the Lakers and Clippers wanted it to. The Lakers were embarrassed, missing the playoffs due to a slew of injuries and incompetence. The Clippers followed suit, losing to the New Orleans Pelicans in the play-in tournament. 
I wish I could tell you that the Los Angeles Sparks were breaking the mold set in place by Crypto.com’s other inhabitants. Unfortunately, the Sparks have struggled this season, falling to a 5-9 record and firing Head Coach Derek Fisher earlier this month. However, as our resident WNBA columnist Ethan Inman has been documenting this summer, the star power on the Sparks makes them competitive in any game. Nneka Ogwumike has led the Sparks in points so far this season and is a surefire selection for the WNBA All-Star Game. Liz Cambage, the Sparks’ top free agent acquisition last season, has also been making her presence felt. 
So as the WNBA season reaches its halfway point, check out Crypto.com Arena for far less cash than any Lakers game would set you back. Tickets for Spark’s games are going as low as $4 on some ticketing apps. The Las Vegas Aces, Cambage’s former team, will play the Sparks on June 27. The Aces have the best record in the WNBA, but with a few more voices in the crowd, perhaps the Sparks can pull off the upset.
Watch MLS just minutes from campus
Los Angeles Football Club resides at the top of the MLS West standings and has two important upcoming matches against some of the league’s top teams. L.A. FC will face the NY Red Bulls on June 26 with a matchup against FC Dallas on June 29. The Red Bulls are second in the MLS East and Dallas sits at fourth in the Western Conference. 
Conveniently for USC students, L.A. FC plays in Banc of California Stadium located just south of campus in Exposition Park. The stadium is a gorgeous venue, seating over 23,000 fans. Skip the commute and save some money by supporting USC’s local MLS squad. Tickets for the FC Dallas game start at $23.

As the 2022 football season approaches, so does the beginning of the Lincoln Riley era at USC. The new Head Coach has attracted a swarm of commits hoping to dominate the Pac-12 after experiencing a 3-6 conference finish last season.
USC’s overall commits are the highest ranked in the Pac-12 for the 2022 season, with an average player score of 90.94 out of 100. The Trojans have 30 new commits, consisting of 20 transfers and 10 recruits. Although the program trails behind Colorado, Arizona and Washington State with the most commits in the conference (31), USC has secured some of the top players in the nation.
The program has two 5-star commits, the most of any Pac-12 squad. Cornerback recruit Domani Jackson was the fifth top recruit in the nation, and quarterback transfer Caleb Williams ranked seventh in the nation’s top recruits in 2021. Oregon, ranked second in the Pac-12 overall, is the only other team in the conference welcoming a 5-star commit this fall.
USC is expecting a talented group of freshman recruits — four of which, Jackson, Raleek Brown, Zion Branch and C.J. Williams, are ranked among the top 100 college football recruits for 2022. Each recruit who signed a letter of intent ranked within the top 100 recruits in their state. 
USC’s 20 transfer commits are the most of any other Pac-12 program this season. 247Sports ranks USC’s transfer lineup number one overall in college football, with an average player score of 90.29 out of 100. Trailing behind USC is Ole Miss with 89.50 and LSU with 88.27. 
Three transfers, Williams, Latrell McCutchin and Mario Williams, are transferring from Riley’s previous program at Oklahoma. Seven other transfers are from Pac-12 squads, including Arizona State, Colorado, Oregon, Stanford, Utah and Washington. 
Riley spoke with Trojans Live in April regarding his first season at USC, saying that “this will be the most unique roster in the history of USC football.”
“It’s been a great transition,” Riley said. “The vibe of the team is really good.”
Riley described the type of player the Trojans look for as someone who embraces the USC football culture. An ideal recruit must work towards achieving individual goals, but they must understand achieving team goals is of utmost importance.
“We’ve brought in guys who don’t only see the opportunity here for themselves, but wanted to be a part of the change and wanted to help lead the charge, and that’s been very positive,” Riley said. 
The 2022 Trojans’ first Pac-12 matchup is Sept. 10 at Stanford.

Coronavirus prevention measures for the upcoming Fall 2022 semester may include an indoor mask mandate if the current rate of infection persists in Los Angeles County, Chief Student Health Officer Dr. Sarah Van Orman said in a student media briefing Monday. L.A. County confirmed over 12,000 new coronavirus cases over a three day period between June 17 to June 20, signaling increasing transmission in the region. 
Between June 12 and June 18, 105 students tested positive, lowering the positivity rate slightly to 11.4% from the previous week — between June 5 and June 11 — when the positivity rate was 11.49%. The staff positivity rate decreased over the same period, falling from 5.35% to 4.7%, with 22 positive test results recorded compared to the previous week’s 27.
Van Orman said she expects to see an increase in coronavirus cases once students return to campus — with move-in dates for USC Housing starting August 17 and Fall 2022 classes commencing August 22 — because USC’s population is composed of people coming from different areas. 
“When people move … we see increases [in cases],” Van Orman said. “At the beginning of each fall semester, in each spring semester, after fall break and after Spring Break, we see a little bump in cases.”
As of right now, the University is not planning to require surveillance testing for returning students and faculty, Van Orman said. 
USC Student Health will continue to offer off-campus accommodations for coronavirus-positive students living in USC Housing. Testing sites will continue to operate on campus for the upcoming term, Van Orman said. The University will decide on community safety measures to be implemented in Fall 2022 in late July or early August, she said, and will make assessments contingent on L.A. County and the nation’s directive.
“COVID-19 is a very fluid situation,” Van Orman said. “We know that there’s some concern that Los Angeles as a community may move back into indoor masking at the end of June or early July and, of course, we would be following whatever the rest of the county is doing.”
The reinstatement of the daily Trojan Check requirement will occur only under a severe public health crisis, Van Orman said, and is not currently being seriously considered for the fall semester. 
“We want to be prepared if the conditions require that we be more stringent, but we think it’s unlikely,” Van Orman said. “If [the Trojan Check requirement was to be reinstated], it would be for probably a brief period of time, just to ensure that people had complied with their testing as they’re coming back.”
Through the Trojan Pandemic Research Initiative, more than 10,000 students, faculty and staff voluntarily reported their reviews about campus safety measures. Participants noted that required Trojan Check completion, masking and testing helped contain the spread of the coronavirus on campus. Other data showed participants felt the requirements were a “hassle,” Van Orman said. 
One of the lessons the University learned from navigating the coronavirus pandemic, Van Orman said, is deciding on the correct measures to implement and when to implement them. Individuals tend to stop complying with health mandates if they feel the requirements set are too excessive, Van Orman said. Mixed reviews of health measures, she said, must be balanced with making the right decision from a public health standpoint. 
“For example, when we stopped Trojan Check, it [was] a very mixed thing,” Van Orman said. “A lot of people are like, ‘Yes, finally,’ but we also hear from a lot of people who feel unsafe and who really want all those things to continue.”

After moving from Egypt to Los Angeles to earn his Ph.D. in electrical engineering, Khaled Hassan discovered that he would have barely enough money to pay for his groceries. With 44% of his full-time Viterbi Ph.D. student stipend going toward a monthly payment of $1,100 to cover his rent and utilities, Hassan quickly realized that small luxuries like going out for dinner or buying coffee from Starbucks were no longer realistic for his budget. 
Although he wasn’t allowed to apply for a traditional full-time or part-time job because of restraints on his visa, Hassan decided to pick up a paid summer internship to save up enough money to get through the rest of the following school year. The additional work, however, took away from the time he would have otherwise dedicated to his research, Hassan said. 
“It’s now not just pleasing your professor,” Hassan said. “You need to have connections that are amazed by your work so they can [hire] you over and over again in the summer and pay you around 10 grand per month, so you can survive during your Ph.D.”
Given the average amount of money that USC graduate students spent on housing during the 2021-22 school year, the typical Ph.D. student studying at the University can expect to spend between $40,000 and $90,000 on rent by the time they complete their four years of grad school. For Ph.D. students completing six-year programs, the total cost of rent could be at least $72,000 and $130,000 by the time they receive their degree. Both of these projections are likely underestimates as they don’t account for inflation — which reached its highest rate in the United States throughout the past four decades this May. 
In a report on their Spring 2022 Wellness Survey, the Graduate Student Government reported that more than 90% of USC graduate students living on the University’s minimum full-time doctoral stipend fit the federal definition of “rent burdened” — spending more than 30% of their take-home income on housing. In their report, GSG also found that 60% of the same students met the criteria for being “severely rent burdened” — with over half of their take-home income going toward housing alone. 
During the 2021-22 academic year, the University’s minimum full-time doctoral stipend was $30,500, which was comparable to UCLA’s minimum of $30,000 but below UC Berkeley’s minimum of $34,000 and significantly less than Stanford University’s minimum annual payment of $47,280. Although USC’s minimum is set to increase to $32,500 for the 2022-23 academic year, GSG expects that approximately 58% of the stipend recipients will remain in the “severely rent burdened” category. 
According to the authors of the GSG report, Kate Vavra-Musser, a doctoral student studying population, health and place, and Katelyn Queen, a doctoral student studying biostatistics, a student paying the average USC graduate student’s reported monthly rent would need a yearly payment of $43,784 to come out of the severely rent burdened category, and $72,974 annually to eliminate their rent burden altogether. 
In an interview with the Daily Trojan, Vavra-Musser said she falls under the severely rent-burdened category, with somewhere between 60 to 70% of her doctoral stipend going toward her rent. Although Vavra-Musser said she wasn’t “incredibly worried about being overburdened” since she had savings from before she started grad school, through her time working on the GSG emergency fund, she’s seen firsthand how difficult it can be for other graduate students to make ends meet. 
“There’s a lot of people who are international students who have a child and they have a spouse … and due to visa stuff, the spouse can’t work,” Vavra-Musser said. 
In addition to meeting students who are struggling to support their families, Vavra-Musser said she’s repeatedly seen unexpected medical emergencies impose unmanageable financial burdens on graduate students.
“[The emergency fund] primarily ends up being used for medical bill coverage,” Vavra-Musser said. “We see students that just can’t pay their rent because of a medical bill, or they’re in debt because they have a medical bill, and sometimes it’s like just a few hundred dollars.” 
Although none of the University’s graduate schools’ standard stipends currently meet GSG’s recommended annual amount of $43,784, some schools have set their minimum payments higher than the University-wide baseline of $34,000. Erik Johnson, the vice dean for academic programs at the Viterbi School of Engineering, announced in February that the standard stipend for Viterbi Ph.D. students on a 50% graduate assistantship appointment would increase from $32,000 to $38,000 a year.  
“The [Viterbi] graduate school had not raised their standard rate for the University in three or four years,” Johnson said. “We could see, first of all, that because there had been no change in the stipend rate, we were falling behind both on what our peer institutions are doing and also just knowing that costs continue going up, and we wanted to make sure that we are supporting our students.”
Johnson said he and his colleagues originally planned to increase the stipend by about 8% or 9%, but after seeing the Los Angeles area inflation rate rise to 8% in May, they made the decision to “bump [it] up a little bit further.” 
Viterbi’s Vice Dean of New Initiatives Dr. Andrea Martin Armani worked alongside Johnson in convincing the school’s dean to pull money from Viterbi’s endowment to increase students’ stipends. Armani said she heard from her current graduate students about their struggles to pay off their basic living expenses and said she understood from personal experience how difficult it could be to get by on a small student stipend. 
“My stipend, I think it ranged between $12,000 to $18,000. Just like students today, my housing, I think, was somewhere between $800 to $1,000 a month, which means it was pretty much my entire stipend … I ate a lot of pasta,” Armani said. “But just because I had a rough Ph.D. doesn’t mean everybody else should have a rough Ph.D. So that’s my attitude, right? Just because I suffer doesn’t mean everybody else should suffer too.”
According to Armani, as a result of a lack of increased funding for stipends from the federal government, it will be difficult for the University to raise the minimum student salary to GSG’s recommended $43,784, but she and the other department administrators will go into the next school year pushing to raise enough money to continue to increase the stipends.
In a similar vein, Johnson said that although he couldn’t be sure how much the School of Engineering will be able to add to the stipend budget, Viterbi will continue to raise its student wages. 
“We are going to continue increasing [the stipend],” Johnson said. “We’re not going to pause it like the University did for several years.”
In an interview with the Daily Trojan, GSG president Sam Garza said he was happy to see the minimum Ph.D. stipend increase but that he and his colleagues still plan to push for a bigger increase. 
“We hope that the minimum stipend can be continually evaluated,” Garza said. “We see that the $32,000 is still pretty low to be able to meet all the rent and cost of living.”
GSG Director of Diversity & Equity-Advocacy Quinn Anex-Ries also said he felt “enthusiastic about the increase” and that, moving forward, he hopes to continue working on GSG’s emergency assistance and basic need assistance programs to support both Ph.D. students and master’s students. 
“Essentially, at most schools, Ph.D. stipends are directly funded by the debt that master’s students go into,” Anex-Ries said. “So while I strongly believe that Ph.D. students should be paid more money and master’s students should have less debt … I think at the end of the day, it’s going to come to a much bigger kind of question that our lawmakers and leaders of higher education institutions are going to have to confront about the finances of higher education.”
This article has been updated to reflect that the minimum stipend for full-time Ph.D. students at the University for the 2022-23 academic year will be $34,000, not $32,500.

The last time mega rap star Drake released an album, it was accompanied with  months and months of buildup — “Certified Lover Boy” dropped last September after almost a year of teasers. 
This time, the wait lasted roughly six hours after Drake said “surprise!” and posted an album cover on Instagram Thursday. The only other time he’s dropped music out of the blue is the critically acclaimed “If You’re Reading This It’s Too Late” mixtape in 2015 — one of Drake’s best works.
“Honestly, Nevermind” might not reach that level, but it’s a solid example of Drake’s versatility as an artist. The 14-track album is the shortest since Drake’s debut in 2010. It offers more focused and pristine production heavy in dance music — a genre in which Drake lacks experience — with a blend of his signature heartbreak. The album has its highs and lows.  
In “Falling Back,” Drake awkwardly sings a portion of the song in a high-pitched voice. I, for one, could have lived happily without knowing how Drake sounds doing his best elmo impression.
However, the message of the song sets the tone of the album: Drake is sad. 
“Texts Go Green” grew on me tremendously with the spectacular production by South African DJ Black Coffee. The light organ keys throughout the song with Drake’s vocals over it is outstanding. If you listen closely, it seems like the organs hit every time Drake comes to a realization. 
Depending on your own love life, the chorus can hit like a knife in the heart. Drake’s “Texts go green, it hits a little different, don’t it?” lyric is a cheeky reference to Apple’s iMessage. Whenever a person is texting a number, the bubble usually appears blue, but the bubble can suddenly show up green if the number is changed or if the sender has been blocked. Drake must’ve messed up. 
As we progress through the tracks, the album becomes a little bleak. 
Outside of the hilarious bed squeak noises on “Currents,” the track is forgettable. “A Keeper” sees Drake proclaiming he’s moved on from his ex-partner over a charmin-soft beat.
The entirety of “Calling My Name” is poor, except for the beat switch in the middle. It shifts the tone to a more bouncy one, but still it didn’t stick. 
What did stick, however, is the track after, “Sticky.” This is arguably the best song on the album. Drake touches on a variety of topics, from his mom wanting him to be corporate to his calls to free Atlanta rapper Young Thug from his current RICO charges to his collaboration with the late Virgil Abloh. The heavy, yet subtle dance beat with a focused Drake rapping overtop is a recipe for success. An Abloh reference reappears at the conclusion of the song with an excerpt from Abloh’s 2017 Columbia lecture.
However, immediately after “Sticky,” my thoughts about the album shifted. 
“Massive” is a beautiful song with incredible Drake vocals and a perfectly placed beat. The low beeping plus piano beat builds up, then rises once Drake starts singing, “Oh, when you’re ready / We can put this behind us.” 
The vocals end just over three minutes into the song, leaving over two minutes for just the beat. It’s a memorable and unique listening experience. 
Drake’s singing on “Flight’s Booked” is certainly a highlight of the album. It touches a nerve from the first second with the English R&B sample singing “Getting late / Why you gotta be.” The song is peak sad Drake, capable of making you rethink the last five years of your life. 
When Drake lightly sings, “When last did we feel this close together? / Chasing sunsets in California,” the way his vocal control causes “California” to roll off his tongue is mesmerizing. 
I started feeling slightly bored as “Overdrive” came on. The beat is a prime example of Drake’s take on house music. The lyrics are heart-wrenching at times too, but it’s the tenth track, and by that time the slow-paced music became repetitive. 
For me, the track felt similar to many others on the album, until the chorus hit, which is generally the formula of this Drake album — a slow buildup to the chorus where the rapper hits you with bars that touch the heart. 
As the album comes to a close, the tracks become tiring. 
“Down Hill” is the most traditional R&B track on the album. “Tie That Binds” has a splendid guitar instrumental that transitions to the song’s strong second half. “Liability” includes a deeper-voiced Drake with an almost 808s & Heartbreak type vibe. 
The main event of the album, though, is at its very conclusion with “Jimmy Cooks.” It’s a huge contrast to the rest of the album because of its rap-heavy nature, with both Drake and 21 Savage murdering the beat. It’s almost like it shouldn’t be on this album. 
Drake is at his best rapping on a fast beat with a subtle violin in the back. He delivers memorable lines like “I might have to make her paint a 6 on her pinky toe,” and refrains fit for summer Instagram captions like “Everybody fake now, you could crack the code.” He also touches on the Young Stoner Life RICO charge with, “Hoes say I’m suave, but I can’t get RICO’d.”
The sudden beat switch between Drake and 21’s vocals creates a dark sound reminiscent of 21 Savage, Offset and Metro Boomin’s collaboration album, “Without Warning.”
21 Savage is in the midst of a features run that is rivaling some of the best in rap history. His verse on “Jimmy Cooks” only adds to that portfolio, shredding the beat with one of the best lines of the year: “If I was Will Smith, I would’ve slapped him with a stick.” It’s a rapid end to an album that’s as slow as the Interstate-5 Freeway during rush hour. 
“Honestly, Nevermind” won’t blow you away if you’re looking for some good old rapping Drake. But, if you fell in love with the Toronto artist because of his relatable heartbreak tracks, you’re in for a good one. Just make sure you don’t listen to this while sad in the club.

While mayoral races are important, they generally do not attract as much attention from voters in Los Angeles as compared to San Diego or San Francisco. Voter turnout for the Los Angeles mayoral race, both primaries and runoffs, has not exceeded 35% since 2001. 
Nonetheless, 2022 candidate Rick Caruso poured over $22 million of his own fortune and $41 million total into his mayoral campaign. Much of his campaign has been focused on media advertisements, essentially leaning into the idea that tormenting voters will gain him enough notoriety to win. 
Caruso has never held political office in his life, instead making his money as a real estate developer through well known shopping malls such as the Grove, the Americana at Brand and the Palisades Village. What is even more interesting and sets Caruso apart from many political candidates is that he was a lifelong Republican before conveniently switching to become a Democrat in 2022, just in time for the mayoral race in one of America’s most liberal cities. 
Caruso holds many parallels to former President Donald Trump. Both men hid the entirety of their tax returns from voters and made money as businessmen before entering politics later in their careers. In fact, Caruso can be seen in the background of the Republican Debate in 2015. It is not far off to say that his values and his recent past are in stark contrast to what L.A. has shown itself to represent. Yet, Caruso still has a chance at the mayoral seat, thanks to his personal fortune. 
While the results of the primary race show Caruso falling behind Karen Bass by about 7%, the mere fact that he has made it to the runoff shows the power of money in elections. House candidates who spend more money win over 90% of the time, according to FiveThirtyEight, and about the same is true for senatorial elections. Our democracy cannot be entirely democratic if money has such a large influence on election results.
Caruso is banking on the fragility of American democracy in order to win. As a candidate, he does not have much to offer Angelenos. Not only does he plan on expanding the L.A. police department by 1,500 officers, which does little to help Angelenos, but he has no stated plan on climate change. Instead, his website, carusocan.com, states only three issues: homelessness, public safety and corruption and ethics — ironic considering buying your way into becoming mayor doesn’t feel quite ethical.
Caruso is running on the ideal that he will create “the most transparent mayoral administration in history,” while ignoring his own role in corruption and scandal. Not only did he lead the Board of Trustees during numerous University scandals, including issues involving sexual violence on campus and Operation Varsity Blues, but Olivia Jade Giannulli was on his boat when the news broke about her family’s lies to get her into USC.  His hypocrisy as a “Democrat” has been called out by Planned Parenthood, since Caruso has donated to anti-abortion political candidates. How much of a Democrat can he really be if he only declared himself one in 2022, the same year as the mayoral election? It appears that Caruso is manipulating the political system to make himself appear more palatable to Angelenos. 
Caruso is using his money to try and paint an entirely different picture of who he is. Not only has he ignored his Republican past, but he has not made an effort to actually tap into what Los Angeles needs: an experienced, diligent leader.
Angelenos have the opportunity to send a strong message to Caruso and to other billionaires who will inevitably try to gain power. While Caruso signs may grace the yards of many homes in the Los Angeles area, the vote count means much more. Every Angeleno should exercise their right to vote this November.

I can recall at least one article I’ve written where I meekly defended Joe Manchin. Even then, I don’t think “defend” is the right word to use to describe what I was doing. I think of that article as my best attempt to argue that political communication — whether it be an ad or an op-ed penned by even the most well-meaning of politicians — would be much more effective if a state or region’s specific concerns are taken into account. I won’t be defending Manchin again here, nor his party for that matter. Whenever I see Manchin, I also see an equally complicit Democratic party looming not too far behind him. 
I’m well aware of the fear that a lot of liberals — and perhaps progressives — have in regards to Manchin. I’ve had that fear too –– the fear that Democrats might lose their already thin margins in the Senate if they cultivate a primary challenger against Manchin; the fear that Manchin is the best we can get or the best that West Virginia can offer. That couldn’t be further from the truth. Manchin is the best that a Democratic establishment has to offer. It’s high time to stop thinking Manchin is immovable because of the preconceived notion that his red state would never vote for an outright progressive. Better options are possible — Democrats just have to put in the effort to look for them.
Unfortunately, the task of looking for a challenger often falls into the hands of independent activist groups who are fed up with Sen. Manchin. When Manchin challenged West Virginian activists to raise a primary challenger against him, local activists created organizations to do just that, such as one called West Virginia Can’t Wait. Even the folks in these groups admit that they can’t rely on the establishment backing Manchin. Katey Lauer, co-chair of West Virginia Can’t Wait, admitted so much by saying that they couldn’t go through “traditional party channels” in order to vet, train and support a challenger, much less help raise up candidates for local and municipal elections.
Therein lies the biggest problem. Grassroots activists and organizations such as Lauer and West Virginia Can’t Wait are communicating a striking, but nevertheless, unsurprising message: They see no progress and frankly, no trust in the traditional party apparatus when it comes to setting up a localized road map to challenge and replace Manchin. The fact of the matter is that the campaign arm of the Democratic party is about as useful as a screen door on a submarine when it comes to investing in state and local elections. Non-white Democratic candidates in local state elections, even outside of West Virginia and the South, are notably left behind by the party establishment. As detailed in a comprehensive piece by SpotlightPA writer Kate Huangpu, candidates from both parties in the Pennsylvania house have been left to fend for themselves by their respective parties. 
And going back to my point earlier about ditching the ill-formed thought that West Virginia would never vote for a candidate left of Manchin, West Virginia Can’t Wait and groups similar to it were able to elect almost a dozen progressive and working-class candidates to local seats all over the Mountain State. Now wouldn’t it be a helluva lot easier to replicate that success if the Democratic party started investing in local candidates and initiatives such as that?
Another issue I have with the party lies within their messaging and how they sell their policies. With the way things have been heading into these midterms, their messaging attempt to defend their slim majority seems to be the same, something along the lines of, “Listen, we’re the best you’re gonna get”. 
That kind of branding won’t get Democrats any votes. If they can’t start fulfilling campaign and platform promises or entrust local organizers who are the most knowledgeable about the state with the resources to support better candidates, there won’t be any blue wave or even a blue ripple in the 2022 midterms. Might I suggest bringing up the fact that Manchin is a modern-day coal baron, making millions from an industry that’s repeatedly taken advantage of the state and its residents, or how he has lifted constituents from poverty thanks to the child tax credits he now helped axe?
So, when non-Southern Democrats get all riled up and start blaming West Virginia voters for Manchin when he inevitably makes a move that’ll infuriate others in his party, they ought to take a step back and ask if West Virginians really had that much of a choice to begin with.

“blue water road” by Kehlani 
With the warm summer ambiance of the track “little story,” which pays homage to the vibes of Lorde’s “Solar Power,” to the melodic calmness of “tangerine,” Kehlani’s summer album makes for a perfect soundtrack to support self-love and trips down the Pacific Coast Highway. 
Released on April 29, Kehlani’s intention for the album is to take you through “an emotional journey, a sexual journey and a spiritual journey.” 
With tracks like “up at night” featuring Justin Bieber, which spotlights the highs of a summer fling, the album successfully takes the audience through an infectious summer experience, one of the first albums released for this year’s summer music season.
“Un Verano Sin Ti” by Bad Bunny 
Just off the first few introductory sounds on this album — seagulls and ocean waves crashing — it’s clear that no outline of summer albums would be complete without mentioning the No. 1 phenomenon by Bad Bunny. 
On the album, whose title literally translates to “A Summer Without You,” Bad Bunny discusses the fleeting romance of summer love in “Agosto,” the struggle of summer in Puerto Rico with the power outage of 2017 in “El Apagón” and of course, the beauty of spending time with a special someone in songs like “Callaita” and “Aguacero.”
The album takes you on a roller coaster of emotions that all can be tied to the simple theme of what summer is meant to encompass: love, loss and growth. 
“Harry’s House” by Harry Styles 
In Harry’s words, “Should we just keep driving” into the list of amazing albums to come out this summer? Next on the list is “Harry’s House,” released May 20. The album debuted at No. 1 on the Billboard Hot 100, with all 13 of the album’s tracks making the top 30.
Taking audiences on a drive, the project leaves behind the long, drab school days and promises new love. The songs from “Harry’s House” vary from radio tracks like “As it Was” to ballads like “Matilda,” but all of them exemplify the idea of homecoming and warmness, which many associate with summer breaks away from the University. 
“i used to think i could fly” by Tate McRae 
Whoever said summer was only about love clearly did not account for the queen of pop, Olivia Rodrigo, who released “SOUR” last summer to mark a sad girl summer for the ages. This year is no exception, with Tate McRae coming in clutch for all those fellow sad girls who ended things with their significant others.
“i used to think i could fly,” released May 27, was duly underrated, with fast-paced bops like “don’t come back” and TikTok sensation “she’s all i wanna be.”
The album exemplifies sad girl summer and is the perfect evocation of the heartbreak-healing tracks on “SOUR” to remedy a broken heart. 
“Proof” by BTS
The anthology album walks through the band’s nine-year career, recounting their journey to current stardom, expressing various emotions and thoughts on the meaning of greatness, fulfillment and the future of BTS. 
Containing three CDs with 48 tracks total, “Proof” presents evidence of BTS’ success. CD 1 chronicles every BTS album title track, from “No More Dream” from their debut album “2 Cool 4 Skool,” to the 2021 record-breaking single, “Butter.”
Overall, “Proof” neatly immortalizes the iconic monuments of BTS’ career so far. Imparting notable memories, the anthology album instills the pillars of BTS’ expanding legacy for fans — and provides a “rough idea of who BTS is” to new listeners.

Parched on a cold day, I stumbled into a local New York City coffee shop. That’s when I spotted a gleaming drink, the soon-to-be bane of my existence. The words “Best Seller,” draped over the cup captured my gaze instantly. I kept reading — I wish I hadn’t. Agave, oat milk and (dun dun dun!) turmeric.
Oh, turmeric. A dear friend that has lived in my grandmother’s anjarai petti, or spice box, since childhood was now sitting on a throne next to good old pumpkin spice like, “You prayed on my downfall, but I made it to the top.”
I couldn’t help but be proud of the seasoning’s rise to hipster fame, but her new name stopped me in my tracks. 
“Golden milk latte?! You’ve gotta be kidding me.” Cue the longest eye roll imaginable.
My brown friends, you guessed it. The traditional home remedy we all grew up on, haldi doodh, or as my Tamil family refers to it, manjal paal, has hit the major milestone of TikTok trend, chic wellness commodity and prized coffee shop specialty. It’s now bedazzled with an assortment of nut milks and organic sugars at outrageous prices. 
However, more noteworthy than anything else, it has finally been deemed acceptable to the Western palate; all it took was a makeover, a new name and some white influencers to get it there. And quite frankly, it shouldn’t have. I’m ready to have that cultural conversation. 
Turmeric, a spice known for its yellow hue and ability to stain pretty much anything, dates back in use nearly 4,000 years to Vedic times in South Asia. According to Ayurvedic medicine, it is believed to have many benefits, from healing cuts to helping with digestion. In my household, it was a natural cure-all.
A spoonful of turmeric would make it into the conversation when I had a cold or a bruise or a breakout. The antiseptic and anti-inflammatory benefits were ones many Desi grandmothers swore by. It made the spice a golden staple in every situation. 
I grew up with a complicated relationship with turmeric, which stemmed from being made fun of. I can still picture the disgusted looks of people in my classes eyeing my yellow food and calling it gross and different. I remember my classmate observing the golden residue on my face from a turmeric mask I had put on the night before and plain out laughing at the “neon” color of my skin. I remember wanting so badly to have grilled cheese or fries instead of the nutritious meal that my mom had made me. Heck, I’d even settle for a PB&J — and I have a severe nut allergy. I became exhausted trying to defend my food choices and wanted all of the chaos to stop with the delight of a manjal-free processed Lunchable. 
Despite how much I loved the taste and qualities of the spice, turmeric was a tool that furthered my “otherness” and exiled me from Western acceptance as a South Asian American, so much so that I actively sought to hide that portion of my identity. It’s a bruise not even the spice itself could heal. 
Flash forward to present day —  the widely accepted “golden milk latte” has amassed nearly 43.3 million views on TikTok alone.
As I browsed through the plethora of videos, I noticed an array of influencers, none of which I could resonate with. My culture was not represented in the space as teachers. Some notable faces compared the flavors of this trendy drink to “Chai tea,” which, I hate to break it to you, is really just “tea tea” when translated. None referred to the origins of the drink, and to the naked eye, you would believe that the concept was birthed in quarantine, not thousands of years ago. 
I’m by no means stating that this manjal paal and golden milk latte exchange is all a bad thing. It should be inferred and encouraged that with immigration and food communication, more individual recipes and alterations will come into fruition. People move, interact and create all the time, and food is a bridge of connection, a language we all speak and feel strongly about. 
I do believe, however, in the power of respecting cultural context. If there is profit without acknowledgment of the source, it’s worth noting. If something that non-white individuals were ostracized for in their youth is suddenly deemed trendy and good when detached from their identity, it’s worth noting. 
We can use the power of the golden milk latte and all of those inducted into the Trend Hall of Fame as valuable learning opportunities — spaces used to educate and respect the cultural origins of the foods we evidently love, but to which we haven’t yet fully given the holistic spotlight. 
There’s a big lesson from that coffee shop encounter — and it’s not that I need to carry water with me at all times to save money on overpriced drinks. 
The message is that true healing lies in more cultural context conversations surrounding the global food we consume. And we need a latte of them, fast.
