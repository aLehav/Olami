Two former School of Cinematic Arts students have created a system to make gaming more of an inclusive, community environment.
Bryan Edelman and Benjamin Skaggs of the Interactive Media and Games Division, designed and developed Colossi LLC., a system that allows groups of all sizes to interact through simple games. Skaggs, who was pursuing a bachelor’s degree in the SCA, has taken an indefinite leave of absence to continue working on the company.
Earlier this month, the duo gathered nearly 100 students to square off in an interactive smartphone game that unfolded on the big screen in the SCA auditorium.
The duo hopes to someday have 10,000 people participate.
“We design and develop the largest crowd scale games that have ever happened,” said Edelman, who graduated with an M.F.A in game and interactive media design in Spring 2015. “We are able to support tens of thousands of people with our architecture.”
According to Edelman and Skaggs, Colossi’s long-term business model involves marketing to arenas, large events and their advertisers. Instead of watching a sponsored car race on the big screen, such as during a USC football game, the pair hopes Colossi will allow observers to play along.
“We have a fundamental belief that people want to interact with things,” Edelman said. “People want to have some type of agency in what they watch when they watch it. Ads haven’t gone there yet. When there’s down time at a basketball game, people aren’t looking at the big screen — they are on their phones. Our business model takes interactive things into the world.”
Smartphones made it easy for those at the USC Makers of Entertaining Games Association kickoff event on Sept. 4 to connect immediately to the Colossi interface just by opening a website. Brendan LoBulgio, a member of MEGA and the event coordinator, spoke about Colossi’s simplicity.
“All we really had to provide was an HDMI cord,” Lobuglio said. “And people really got engaged. They were standing up and banging on their desks.”
LoBuglio described two of the games played at the event. “Puck Race” involved swiping a character through a maze, and “Color Wars” involved filling as much area as possible on the screen with a trail of paint. The group played in large teams, and each game was short. Each round ran for about a minute.
“Colossi is a group of games that operate in a shared interface, and the content of each game is different,” LoBuglio said. “The team dynamics were also different for each game.”
According to Skaggs, Colossi games are big, exciting and fast, but they are also meant to bring people together. Edelman and Skaggs set out to create something that more than two people could enjoy at a time.
“We loved bringing people together to play games, but we were asking ourselves: Why make something only a handful of people can play?” Skaggs said. “Why can’t we get 100 people to play? That should be possible.”
This is not Edelman and Skaggs’ first collaboration. The pair actually met and began working together three years ago. Colossi began as Edelman’s M.F.A thesis project, and Skaggs is currently taking leave from his undergraduate career at USC to pursue the project.
“We’ve failed countless times, but through all that failure we’ve designed some simple games that are super engaging and easy to understand, that can make even 1 in 10,000 feel like they have agency in the outcome,” Edelman said.
Edelman and Skaggs attributed trial and error to the bulk of their success with Colossi and reccommended that any entrepreneur start creating.
“Just make stuff. Start making things,” Skaggs said. “We are both serial makers. You can always make it better, or move on to something else.”

The Gustavo Casasola Foundation and USC Libraries came together to kick off the “¡Viva La Cámara!” exhibit at Doheny Memorial Library Wednesday night and, coincidentally, Mexican Independence Day.
“¡Viva la Cámara!” is a photo exhibit documenting the height and conclusion of the Mexican Revolution.
The event was hosted by Professor Liana Stepanyan. Guest speakers were UCLA Professor Maarten Van Delden and accomplished photojournalist Gustavo Casasola.
Many of the photos were taken by the Casasola family during the Mexican Revolution. Now, Gustavo Casasola owns all of them.
Casasola has a large private collection and also allows his family’s archive to be shown around the world. He has decided to display some of his pictures on the Ground Floor Rotunda of Doheny Memorial Library through Dec. 16.
Emily Jetter, a senior majoring in psychology, believes that all students should come see these photos.
“Students should come see this because it is an important part of our culture here in Los Angeles, [where] there is a big Mexican influence,” she said. “Also, this exhibit shows the importance of courageous journalists to document these things.”
Preceding the exhibit, Van Delden and Casasola gave a history of the Mexican Revolution.
During the time of the revolution, photojournalists used the reflex camera to capture key photos of the events and its aftermath.
These photos captured the conflict between the leaders of rebel armies, as well as the social struggles of daily life. The Casasola family, who ultimately established the first news agency in Mexico City, took many photos during the time of the revolution.
Casasola spoke on the role of photojournalists, many of whom included his own family members, during this time. He spoke in Spanish, but his words were translated.
Casasola said that, “reporters were unprotected and vulnerable.” Many of them risked and sacrificed their lives for some of these pictures.
Adam Espinoza, a freshman majoring in computer science and business administration, said that the exhibit gave him an important historical perspective on journalism.
“It is very interesting to see the journalists out there on the front lines,” he said. “You see a lot of parallelism between the journalists in today’s age who go out on the battle lines and record events.”
Espinoza said he felt that the exhibit gives students an important cultural insight into Hispanic history.
“This is important so students of different backgrounds can understand cultural relativism. I truly believe that if you live in this area, then you should come see this exhibit to learn about this era in Mexico,” he said. “It is also Hispanic Heritage Month, so that is another reason for students to come out and involve themselves.”
The full Gustavo Casasola Foundation archive is open to researchers, students, educational institutions and others.

This semester the Department of Public Safety has switched its security hires, upsetting some students who believe the new employees lack knowledge and training.
In addition to DPS staff and the Los Angeles Police Department  officers, USC also hires private contractors from two companies — Staff Pro and Contemporary Services Corporation — to manage security on and off campus. In the past, Staff Pro managed security inside the perimeter of campus and CSC handled off-campus safety. This meant that Staff Pro workers swiped students in at residence halls and stood guard outside each of the libraries while CSC staffers worked stations at high-traffic checkpoints — such as the Row — to provide a visible point of reference for students in case of an emergency.
CSC staffers also handled the campus entrances at night. After 9 p.m., the campus is shut off to public access. In past years, CSC workers were stationed at these gates, only allowing students, faculty and approved guests to enter campus. The recent DPS staffing decision replaced these CSC staffers with Staff Pro workers in the hopes of providing more continuity to on-campus security.
“We’ve seen that the students really do build up a relationship with the security workers who are in their dorms every night,” DPS Deputy Chief David Carlisle said. “It just makes sense to extend that familiarity to the people who are checking students in and out of campus each night.”
Staff Pro also offered a highly competitive bid to the University, making the change more cost effective, Carlisle said. The adjustment meant that 15 CSC staffers were replaced with Staff Pro employees. These employees guard the locked gates at night and also interact with people entering the school as they manage traffic through the gates. Students, however, have not been entirely pleased with the new employees.
Junior Jason Brown said that he noticed the change from CSC to Staff Pro almost immediately upon arriving on campus this year. He reported that several Staff Pro employees struggled to give him directions to landmarks such as Tommy Trojan.
“I’m concerned with Staff Pro’s ability to maintain the security of our campus,” Brown said. “[CSC employees] were friendly and helpful. They were very knowledgeable and took pride working here at USC. Most were members of the community and were here since the program started.”
Freshman Cheryl Hagan noticed the difference in personnel between her visit in early January and her time on campus this year. She said she was surprised to see Staff Pro employees making calls, texting and listening to music during their shifts, as well as treating students rudely when they entered campus.
“How are they supposed to monitor their surroundings like that?” Hagan said. “We need guards or a company that provides great customer service and has responsible employees to look out for us. Our education and our security should be important.”
Despite these complaints, Carlisle maintains that the switch from Staff Pro to CSC shouldn’t affect the quality of campus security as both companies are equally equipped to provide protection to students and faculty.
“Both of these companies perform their jobs exceptionally well, so that was never the problem,” Carlisle said. “We just wanted to provide consistency in who was dealing with our students on a day-in, day-out basis. What’s important is keeping our kids safe, and this was a good decision in keeping with that.”

Students, faculty and other members of the community gathered Wednesday evening in the Wallis Annenberg Hall to watch the second Republican primary debate.
The event was hosted by the Jesse M. Unruh Institute of Politics, the Price Bedrosian Center on Governance and the Annenberg Center on Communication, Leadership and Policy.
Prior to the debate, the Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism’s Dean Emeritus Geoffrey Cowan moderated a panel featuring Cokie Roberts, a prominent journalist and author, James Barnes, U.S. Politics and Advocacy for Facebook; Matt Rodriguez, CEO of Rodriguez Strategies; and Robert Shrum, Louis Warschaw Chair in Practical Politics and Professor of the Practice of Political Science at USC.
The Republican debate, which was hosted by CNN, lasted several hours, and featured the following candidates: former Hewlett-Packard CEO Carly Fiorina, Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker, U.S. Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky, Ohio Gov. John Kasich, New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, former neurosurgeon Ben Carson, businessman Donald Trump, former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas, Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida and former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee.
CNN Washington correspondents Jake Tapper and Dana Bash moderated the debate, along with radio host Hugh Hewitt.
Razzan Nakhlawi, a sophomore majoring in print and digital journalism, said she attended the event to learn about current events.
“I like to keep up with politics in general,” she said. “I’m personally a Democrat, so I’m pretty left wing, but I like to keep up with what the other side is doing, what they’re saying.”
James Tyner, a freshman majoring in print and digital journalism, said he attended the debate because he does not have a set political stance.
“It’s important to see what all of the candidates are saying because the news cycle is all about Donald Trump or Hillary Clinton, and there isn’t much focus on the other candidates,” he said.  “It’s also important to see which candidate has a cohesive vision for what they want to accomplish.”
Many USC students attended the debate, completely filling the main lobby.
“It was a fabulous turnout of USC students,” Roberts said. “I think that it shows interest in politics, but I also think it shows a tremendous interest in the characters in this particular debate.”
Cowan said the turnout was so large because students are interested in current events.
“They know that the decision in this election will make a difference in terms of their lives,” he said.  “They want to be more informed, and they weren’t just watching the debate, they were also here for the discussion about the issues that were substantive on campus. I think that partly speaks to the fact that they want to be part of an academic as well as a political conversation.”
Despite being known as the conservative party, verbal zings were flying across the Ronald Reagan Memorial Library where the debate was held as the candidates argued for their own policies, disputed their opponents’ and attacked each other’s records.
“If you go online, if you were following Twitter, they say that this debate is out of control,” Cowan said. “Debates have become more about personality and language because in a way you want to know who you like, who you want [as president] for that period of time.”
Cowan said that the person voters like as a candidate might not always be the one with the best policies.
“Carly Fiorina is the person whose comments have been most effective in this debate,” Cowan said. “To me, I don’t feel like Donald Trump has good answers to things.”
Dan Schnur, director of the Unruh Institute of Politics, moderated brief discussions during the commercial breaks as well as an extended panel discussion of the debate after it ended. The panelists were former California assemblymembers Tony Strickland and Dario Frommer, as well as Paul Samaha, a junior majoring in public relations, and Anshu Siripurapu, news editor of the Daily Trojan.
“I think that the biggest thing is that the debate was about capturing what the Republican party stood for,” Frommer said during one of the breaks. “There was a lot of talk about immigration, and immigration is really out of the mainstream right now.”
Samaha noted how the candidates who are not career politicians were more reluctant to speak on issues of foreign policy.
“I think it’s really interesting how Trump, Fiorina and Carson have been silent in this last quarter as the debate turned to international affairs,” Samaha said. “I actually think that Jeb and Rubio did a really good job of spinning the Iraq and Afghanistan wars to make it seem like it was Obama’s fault rather than Bush’s.”

Katlyn Lee | Daily Trojan
Remember when Trivia Crack was all the rage last spring? Admittedly, it took over my life for a short period of time. Trivia Crack had replaced Facebook, Pinterest and Buzzfeed as my main distractors in classes. Though I slowly gravitated back toward social media and personality quizzes, I’m proud to admit that I earned a record-setting 96 percent accuracy in the Arts and Entertainment section. (Sports, on the other hand, we won’t talk about.)
So when I applied and was later accepted as lifestyle editor right around the height of my Trivia Crack career, I looked forward to the prospects of my new section. Entertainment, including travel, books, movies, television, music and art, has always been a passion of mine, and signing off as editorial director, I thought being lifestyle editor would be a more tailored focus of my interests.
My enthusiasm also has to do with the fact that Los Angeles contributed immensely  to my understanding of culture. A very loose definition I apply to culture is a binding factor that brings people together. All forms of entertainment, and in my case, movies and music, have that effect on people. Just talking about TV series like True Detective or the rock band Vampire Weekend always elicit the most exciting conversations.
Luckily for me and my writers, L.A. is one of the most prominent cultural and media capitals in the world. I encourage my team of approximately 50 writers to branch out and document as many L.A. events as possible. I think of our section as stenographers for Los Angeles, relaying to Daily Trojan readers the city’s rhythm and beat. One week, the city might be celebrating donuts at a donut festival. Another week, it’s a spotlight on the new Frank Gehry exhibition. Snapshots of individual events offer fellow Trojans a new perspective on the ever-expanding and bustling urban atmosphere.
Almost as important as introducing new surroundings is introducing new material. With new entertainment in various mediums produced daily, it’s essential to detail our reactions to these pieces of work. More often than not, we cast entertainment subjects aside as light-hearted material, but it’s essential to understand that with subjects such as what’s currently playing in the theaters and on music shelves in stores is the power to connect people together. Our opinions about these subjects also generate thought-provoking discourse. 
As essential as coverage of outside material is, it’s important to capture the inner workings of USC as well. Again, due to our setting in L.A., USC is a hub for creative students from all over the world. This semester, Lifestyle aims to profile students for their achievements and contributions to the community. So far, we’ve featured a Disney Channel actress, a budding virtual reality entrepreneur and an aspiring singer — there’s definitely more to come. 
Another change to Lifestyle this semester is the more intimate nature of our columns. Usually, columnists are selected through previous experience on staff, and exhibition of writing acumen. Giving columnists more free reign of their material will open the door to greater variety in perspectives. On Mondays, we have two alternating music columns while on Tuesdays, Our Women in Film runs. After that, our Wednesday columnists write about mental and physical well-being. Thursdays we have our Melbourne study abroad column and Friday is our book column.
At a glance, Lifestyle might seem like a compilation of articles just showcasing aspects of entertainment, but on a larger scale, it’s so much more — it’s a section that draws people together.

Some may regard it as an indication of a pending criminal invasion, while others regard it as an art form. Nevertheless, graffiti reflects the artistic essence of Melbourne.
Despite the State of Victoria’s zero-tolerance policy toward defacement of property, graffiti seamlessly melds into the urban district. The presence of graffiti is neither indicative of class nor violence. Murals appear less than 100 feet from both a homeless shelter on Smith Street and an Hermés store on Collins Street. Rather, the individual pieces, though lacking cohesion at first glance, meld together to give Melbourne its vibrancy. A casual stroll down the streets turn into masterful explosions of colors, imagery and sometimes, oddity.
The street life of Melbourne encompasses several parts of the city’s experience. The city is known worldwide for its livability. The place is a mass gathering of contrarians, expressing its art in a variety of mediums. The most common art form is graffiti, and images on corridors are usually large-scale, imaginative murals that captivate passersby immediately.
Though the main streets receive the highest scrutiny from law officials, leaving them free from wall art, the graffitied alleyways keep the vitality alive. The distinct role that graffiti plays in characterizing the city makes it an attraction, especially for visitors. One heavily impacted space, Hosier Lane, changes almost monthly as artists scramble to showcase their work to a new batch of onlookers.
The street art reflects the accepted eccentricities of the public; it follows the anything goes attitude of the city that celebrates its hidden gems and livability. The murals of Mike and Sully from Monster’s Inc. are located not far from a tapas eatery that similarly incorporates the street art in its interior as well as in its fusion food. Several cafes on pedestrian streets maintain the graffiti elements in the shop, incorporating tags and throw-ups — quick graffiti art — on tables and walls and music to reflect the chaotic, yet organized, nature of the urban art.
Nowadays, a common trend in the street art scene is yarn-bombing — the use of yarn to cover objects in public space. Trees, tram signs and poles blocking off the entrance to facilities are victim to the knitters who impressively create perfectly sized cozies for infrastructure.
The murals and freestyle pieces in corridors create new forms of public space. Cafes and brasseries respond to the artwork, setting up chairs and table service at the street center. The process occurs in almost every laneway, creating a socially constructed public space where people can experience the artwork while enjoying a coffee with friends. There is almost a Parisian-like culture of people-watching, but in Melbourne the culture revolves around experiencing the vitality of art that takes form in a variety of ways in the street.
Street art fuses seamlessly with those who walk the street itself. Melbourne is a city of experimentation in several realms, fashion being one of them. Platform shoes — even Converse —  layering of clothing and sometimes the occasional Hello Kitty ensemble can be seen in the city. Denim on denim and wild piercings are all acceptable, as the then-fringe brings in the new fad in the city. Individualism and originality are what are truly in style.
Street performers breathe life into the art walks. The predominant form of expression is music, ranging from a man singing “Jolene” at a major intersection —  Swanston and Bourke Street —  or a revived multi-colored punk couple sitting at the corner of a laneway, with seven inches of graffiti on the walls, asking for money claiming they are “too ugly to prostitute.” In front of the state library, a drifter with a kazoo the size of a python holds a music battle with a young student who decided that strumming chords on the guitar was too conventional; he flips the guitar on its back and settles in creating a dual-instrument harmony.
The streets are truly a place where the city comes to life. The multiplicity of languages buzzing through the air, the electrical wiring lining the sky in CBD gives a small jolt when trams hit an intersection and the occasional vagabond trumps down the street demanding attention. The city is highly walkable, but the free tram zone helps alleviate what would be almost uncountable foot traffic as over 4 million dwell in the city.
Architecture across the city expresses cutting-edge identities; buildings with common facades oozing green slime, skyscrapers with windows alternating between primary colors and carbon conscious office buildings covered in rainbow pixels, are all commonplace elements. Through designing buildings, architects join the street artists in painting the landscape of the streets. Though high-rises are primarily concentrated in and around the CBD, the eccentric characteristics of design travel throughout the districts.
The street is where a life in Melbourne is truly lived.

Petty Cash, an acclaimed taqueria, has recently established its second location in the heart of downtown Los Angeles’s Arts District. Nestled in an unassuming brick building, it is an expansive space complete with bright colors, wooden furniture and dangling string lights.
Upon walking in, patrons have a full view into head chef David Chavez’s kitchen, a privilege for foodies everywhere. After training at Le Cordon Bleu in Austin, Texas, Chavez ran Bouchon Bakery in New York and, in 2013, was promoted to executive sous chef of Bouchon Beverly Hills. While working as head chef of The Kitchen in Sacramento, he was approached by Petty Cash owner and chef Walter Manzke to partner as chef de cuisine at the new location. The duo is committed to maintaining Manzke’s seasonable and sustainable approach to eating with vibrant local produce, fish and ingredients.
Growing up in San Diego, Manzke often crossed the California border to Tijuana for cheap tacos and a fun music scene. Such was the inspiration for Petty Cash. His vision became reality upon collaboration with renowned restaurateur Bill Chait of Sprout LA. The restaurant combines classic Mexican street food with high-end ingredients in a graffiti-painted space named after rockers Tom Petty and Johnny Cash. This eclectic mixture of elements allows for a unique dining experience before the food has even touched the communal tables.
When food does come, though, customers immediately recognize the differences from traditional taqueria fare. This begins with the “bomb.com,” a delicious housemade sea urchin guacamole accompanied by a cone of chicharrones. The puffy, crackling fried pig skins complement the fresh flavor of Polito Farms avocados, which are delivered to the restaurant daily. Additionally, ensalada de frutas con chile is offered as a seasonal appetizer. The crisp fruits are truly refreshing and have a spicy kick from toasted and ground chiles.
Chavez, again, shows off his affinity for balancing flavors with an impeccable assortment of ceviche dishes. Sushi-style tuna paired with avocado, cucumber and lime juice creates a light yet flavorful sensation. The lean fish is used intentionally with a healthy fat for contrast. However, in another dish, a heartier hamachi is used with in-season grapes, pepitas and poblano peppers for eye-watering spice. Petty Cash’s quesadillas are also a popular family style item. For example, the “Gringa Style” quesadilla is a decadent twist on the simple combination of cheese and tortilla. It incorporates tender adobe chile-rubbed pork shoulder, and melty jack cheese and is topped with avocado crema.
And finally, there are the tacos. Ordered a la carte, they can come all together on a platter or separate like a tasting menu. Do not underestimate their small size as each packs a substantial punch of flavor on a handmade tortilla that is pressed to order. Specifically, the charcoal-grilled octopus taco combines chewy, smoky octopus with peanuts, chile de arbol salsa and slices of avocado for a new take on the classic seafood taco. For the less adventurous, the Cook’s Ranch Pork Belly Carnitas does not disappoint. The meat is the star of the show, juicy and tender, complemented by salsa verde, guacamole and jalapeños.
Though the delicious food often steals the show, Petty Cash’s new Downtown location also has a revamped selection of signature cocktails. At Petty Cash, the bartenders are more than just bartenders, they are mixologists. The same level of passion is true of the servers who are knowledgeable and enthusiastic about every aspect of the menu. This appears to be a trend among the restaurants in Sprout LA’s collective. It makes a simple dinner feel like a true culinary experience, and it is now one that USC students have right in their backyard. The menu is admittedly pricey, but that should not discourage students from splurging for a date night or birthday dinner with friends. Be among the first to check out Downtown’s newest hidden gem because once word gets out, the wait for a table might be a while.

As predicted, the second Republican National Debate for the 2016 presidency was ultimately a clash of personalities between 11 divisive dispositions rather than a battle of ideologies and policy positions.
The general ambiance of the race, which currently consists of 15 widely recognized Republican candidates, was overwhelmingly summarized by candidate Carly Fiorina’s early assertion: “I think Mr. Trump is a wonderful entertainer.”
The Republican race has been dominated by the (in)famous business mogul Donald Trump’s lead. After the 2012 election, the Republican National Committee seemed slated to support a candidate who could cross the partisan line drawn by over a decade of stringent division. Perhaps a candidate with millennial experience and understanding of the modern conflict between dreams and the failing economy. Flash forward from the 2012 presidential election, and the Republican party is stuck with a reality TV star.
The first 20 minutes of the debate was not impacted with talks of governmental control over the internet through later generations of the Patriot Act, imploding student debt or the impending explosion of the Social Security bubble. Instead, the debate consisted of personal threats.
Acknowledging Trump’s previous insults, in which he questioned Carly Fiorina’s abilities, exclaiming, “look at that face,” Fiorina responded: “I think that women all over this country heard very clearly what Mr. Trump said.” Her cool, calm response to the front runner’s sexist insult exemplified a winning combination of Republican grace and liberal feminism, but it still could not curb the overwhelming power of “The Donald.”
Ultimately, this debate was nothing more than an act of entertainment. CNN’s approach to the second debate, riding on the enthusiastic wave of first debate on Fox News, was to take random campaign statements from the contenders and ask for other candidates responses to their contemporaries.
Clocking in at almost three hours and impacted with personalities vying to be as loud and demanding as Donald Trump’s, the second debate came across as a weak and substance-poor version of the first.
Ben Carson, who has catapulted to second place, superseding previously second and third place candidates Jeb Bush and Scott Walker, maintained a calm, inoffensive demeanor, exactly what could be expected of a man who would make an exemplary surgeon general and a completely unqualified commander-in-chief. Carson had some nice sound bytes, some of which will be lauded as points of American exceptionalism, and others which will be condemned by liberals as privileged and idealistic. Regardless, the words heard by the American public were the tabloid-esque insults pointed to and from Donald Trump.
Laced with mudslinging toward Trump, last night’s GOP debate consisted of character assassinations and non-sequiturs. Despite being hosted in the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library, few debaters maintained the dignity and respect of the site’s namesake. Although all the candidates tried to invoke his legacy (his name was mentioned 20 times Wednesday night), they refused to acknowledge that Reagan would have failed as president if he did not maintain his vision for his future instead of dwelling on the errors of the past, as well as focusing on issues that enraged liberal voters as well as conservative ones.
In the aftermath of the 2012 election, centrists and moderate liberals seemed receptive to republican and libertarian notions of smaller government, more room for individual autonomy, business opportunities and a decrease in police militants. In 2015, that has been replaced by fever for defunding Planned Parenthood — an organization which only uses federal funds to finance non-abortive services — and building a wall to keep out illegal immigrants.
Contemporary young people who believe in the market economy and American sovereignty wanted a substantive and comprehensive debate to map out a curious and variable future. And considering that Republicans already are underrepresented among millennials, further debates should greater appeal to this demographic.
“People at home want to know how we’re going to fix this place,” said Ohio Gov. John Kasich. Yes, everyone wants to know. Young Americans wants to know which GOP candidate will provide a solution to the higher education crisis in this country, which GOP candidate will acknowledge climate change and police brutality as threats to American sovereignty as strong as those of the Social Security bubble and Chinese ownership of American debt and which candidate on that stage will finally see that this is a nation made not of liberals and conservatives but of all Americans who wish to achieve the American Dream. Unfortunately, this debate did not reveal much of importance, but the tabloids will have more than their fair share of headlines.

“Money, money, money / must be funny / in a rich man’s world,” the popular Swedish pop group ABBA declared in their hit single, “Money, Money, Money.” ABBA may remind you of embarrassing nights of impromptu karaoke with your parents, but their song still resonates today, when the income gap is ever-widening and the cost of education is becoming even more exorbitant.
Led by President Rini Sampath, Undergraduate Student Government recently shed light on the increases in school tuition over the years. This year alone, tuition has risen over $2,000 from the 2014-15 school year. Over the past four years, tuition has increased 11.6 percent, while cumulative inflation has only been 3.9 percent. What’s the result? The Class of 2016 is paying roughly $6,000 more per year than they paid when they first stepped foot on campus as freshmen. Tuition has increased dramatically — and with no real explanation. While costs have reached double digit increases, USC has been undergoing an ambitious — and successful — $6 billion fundraising campaign, spearheaded by President C. L. Max Nikias. The University’s campaign has been a smashing hit, but it raises the question: Where are all those dollars going?
It’s time we have an honest, substantive conversation about what students are paying for in a college education. Yearly tuition increases aren’t even the whole picture. Add on room and board, books and supplies, personal items, transportation and other mandatory fees associated with college, and the cost of attendance for a school like USC can probably be the down payment on a home. While some students can pay the full price or others have scholarship opportunities and financial aid, it largely affects those stuck in the middle. Financial aid doesn’t cover costs, and scholarships can only offer so much. With tuition increases year after year, the effect is magnified. Students struggle to come up with payments for school and are left saddled with debt or resort to leaving school and continuing their education elsewhere. Worse, some just drop out of school entirely.
Across the country, public and private school tuitions are increasing, but here at USC, the aggregate cost looks more and more like a life insurance policy rather than tuition. The cost to learn shouldn’t be so steep that students are forced to drop out and work underpaid jobs. Tuition hikes have taken a toll, and it’s time we address it head on.
As USC aims to become more of an elite university, it may look to the Ivy League approach of education, in which some universities allow families who make less than $65,000 per year to make no contribution to the cost of education. If education is the key to a successful career and life, then a fiscal barrier should not exist. The onus should rest on the shoulders of universities to make college affordable and help students succeed — and that all starts with paying to attend college.
USG has done its part. It has expressed its concerns about tuition hikes and costs of attendance for students and how financial hardships affect them in the classroom or cause them to leave the classroom altogether. Fundamentally, students are suffering when concerning what comes out of their pockets and those of their families to pay for school. With this $6 billion fundraising campaign, USC is on par with the upper echelon of universities, such as Harvard, and its fundraising efforts. But, if USC truly wants to reach the status of a bastion of intellectual thought, it should consider something as bold as free tuition for students whose familes make less than $65,000 per year or at the very least, consider a tuition freeze for the next five years. Admission rates have declined year after year. With top-talent students receiving offers from across the country to attend prestigious and elite universities, decisions often come down to one thing — money.
ABBA was right. Money is tough to come by, but in a rich man’s world, it must be funny.

The Trojans (2-0) had another strong practice in preparation for the game against the Cardinal (1-1) on Saturday.
“I loved the energy of the defense,” said head coach Steve Sarkisian. “It was very encouraging.”
Sarkisian refers to Wednesday practices as “lunch pail and hard hat days.” He says his players are working hard and have put in a lot intense work so far this week.
In the two teams’ five previous meetings, a combined 23 points have decided the games. Their last two matchups both came down to a field goal. Even though USC is a 10-point favorite heading into the game, the Trojans are treating it as if it is going to be just as competitive as year’s past.
“Every year is unique to its own,” defensive coordinator Justin Wilcox said. “So we’re going to have to play our best game.”
Freshman tailback Ronald Jones II had successful games to start the season, receiving high praise for his play. Some are even comparing him to Reggie Bush.
“I think it’s way too soon. [Bush is] the best, the greatest in my opinion,” Jones said. “But it’s an honor to even be in the same category as him.”
The five tailbacks have been rotating throughout the past two games.
“I think we just all complement each other,” Jones said. “And just bring out the best in each other.”
The overall intensity of practices has been stronger when compared to fall camp. For Sarkisian, Tuesdays and Wednesdays are the “meat and potatoes” days of practice.
“[The players are] really giving us a lot of intensity and energy,” Sarkisian said.
One of USC’s key players is sophomore wide receiver JuJu Smith-Schuster. Against Idaho, Smith-Schuster had 10 catches for 192 yards. Sarkisian emphasized Smith-Schuster’s “unbelievably competitive” personality and great leadership qualities.
On Smith-Schuster’s main receiver role on the offense, Sarkisian spoke about how much work Smith-Schuster has put in so far this season.
“He’s a guy that is really cherishing the opportunity to be the go-to guy,” Sarkisian said. “He’s earned it.”
Looking at Stanford, Sarkisian focused on the fact that the team will need to find a way to stop redshirt senior quarterback Kevin Hogan from finding his rhythm. The key will be to keep him “uncomfortable” throughout the game.
“When he gets hot, it’s very, very scary,” Sarkisian said.
For freshman linebacker Cameron Smith, playing Stanford this weekend will feel different compared to the games against Arkansas State and Idaho.
“I feel more passionate,” Smith said. “It’s going to be more of a college game than these last two.”
Something that is new to the Trojans this year in relation to previous seasons is the depth USC now has. Sarkisian made it a point to play everyone in the first two games because the team’s depth is a strength for them.
“The idea behind it all is that these [games] are going to become four quarter games,” Sarkisian said. “We want to be at our best in the fourth quarter.”
Sarkisian is not looking at this game having a similar outcome to the previous matchups with Stanford. He is making sure his players are practicing hard and playing quality football as Saturday draws near.
“Every game takes on its own personality,” Sarkisian said.
The players are looking forward to their first look at Pac-12 play.
“I’m just ready to go out there and compete,” said sophomore wide receiver cornerback Adoree’ Jackson.
The Trojans take on the Cardinal this Saturday at the Coliseum at 5 p.m.

If we judged teams off the performance on just two weeks, USC would be leading the pack by far. The Trojans put up back-to-back 50-point games while holding both of their opponents under double digits.
In other words, the Trojans dominated from start to finish. Albeit, both of those games were against subpar competition, two Sun Belt teams — Arkansas State and Idaho.
One shouldn’t be so quick to judge the Trojans on those two games, however. The SEC consistently schedules FCS opponents and plays one less conference game than the Trojans, something that could come back to haunt the Pac-12 in December.
The Trojans did exactly what was expected of them this week and cruised to a blowout win. The same can’t be said for some of those SEC teams.
Auburn needed a last minute touchdown and overtime to overcome lowly Jacksonville State, and that same Arkansas State team that lost by 49 to USC led No. 21 Missouri for much of the fourth quarter before succumbing to late mistakes. No. 18 Arkansas lost to a Toledo team that had not beaten a ranked team since 2012.
If you take a glance at the schedule, you’ll notice some other top teams struggled against far inferior opponents.
Oregon, Arizona State and Arizona all endured stiff competition from the likes of Eastern Washington, Cal Poly and UT San Antonio, respectively.
In all honesty, those two games against Idaho and Arkansas State were vital for the Trojan’s postseason hopes, as the rest of the schedule seems daunting.
The Stanford Cardinal will roll into Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum this Saturday as a true underdog for the first time since maybe 2010.
Even though the Trojans are considered favorites on paper, games between the two Pac-12 giants are almost impossible to predict.
Over the past five games, neither team has won by more than seven points. The last two were won off the foot of USC kicker Andre Heidari.
Don’t expect anything less this year.
Though the Cardinal suffered a shocking defeat to Northwestern in their season opener, the team is still coached extremely well and led by an experienced winner in quarterback Kevin Hogan.
A win for the Trojans on Saturday will justify their position as the No. 6 team in the country. A blowout win would be even better.
Senior Cody Kessler also has the opportunity to validate the preseason Heisman hype surrounding him. Kessler has been phenomenal in the first two games, passing for 650 yards and seven touchdowns on a 78.9 percent completion rate.
Kessler is the only quarterback in the FBS to throw for seven touchdowns and zero interceptions.
However, in his two previous games against Stanford, Kessler has managed just 423 yards and one touchdown. To put that into perspective, Kessler threw for 410 yards and three touchdowns just against Idaho this past weekend.
The Trojans will need a big game out of Kessler if they want to get past the Cardinal comfortably.
Looking ahead, the Trojans have quite the schedule in front of them. As it stands right now, the Trojans have five Top 25 opponents on the schedule — No. 8 Notre Dame, No. 21 Utah, No. 20 Arizona, No. 12 Oregon and No. 10 UCLA.
If the Trojans can get by Stanford this week and Arizona State the following week, that could set up a Top Five showdown against the Fighting Irish, assuming they can overcome ACC challengers Georgia Tech and Clemson.
The schedule lightens up a little with games against Utah and Cal following the trip to South Bend.
The way Arizona’s schedule lines up — their only ranked opponent before USC being UCLA on Sept. 26 — the Wildcats could enter the Coliseum as a one-loss or even undefeated team.
Things don’t get any easier for the Trojans as they finish the season against Oregon (away) and UCLA (home). Oregon has a better chance to run the table in Pac-12 — their only ranked opponent right now is No. 21 Utah who makes the trek to Eugene.
By the end of the season, the Trojans could have faced seven ranked opponents, assuming Arizona State and Stanford jump back into the Top 25 come season’s end.
That would be a historic schedule for the Trojans.
To put it into perspective, last season’s champion, Ohio State, played three Top 25 opponents all season long. The year before that, Florida State played only four Top 25 opponents.
The first two blowout victories were great, but get ready and buckle up because it’s going to be a long season for the Trojans.

The last USC freshman to open the football season as middle linebacker was New Zealander Riki Gray, who helped the 1978 Trojans win a national championship. At 6-foot-2 and 245-pounds, Cameron Smith looks the part to continue USC’s strong tradition at the position essential in stopping Stanford’s rush attack.
“It’s always going to be a good game because Stanford is going to be tough,” Smith said after Wednesday’s practice. “[Christian] McAfree is a quick guy. He’s not so big but he’s going to be shifty in the role and has done a lot of good things. We have got to shut him down outside of the backfield.”
His attention to detail, preparation and improvement have caused many to rave about the true freshman. Though he is wearing the No. 35, as opposed to the legendary No. 55, Smith will certainly draw comparisons to Trojan legends Junior Seau, Willie McGinest and Chris Claiborne, who also wore it. But Smith is trying to emulate a more recent USC hero, Brian Cushing.
“I’m growing out the hair right now, actually,” Smith said. “He is my favorite player. I think that it is everyone’s goal to end up in the NFL, but I just want to be remembered as a guy with great work ethic and a guy who does all of the right things.”
Smith, who enrolled at USC in the spring of 2015 after graduating a semester early from high school, has already contributed to a defense that lost talent at linebacker with the NFL departure of All American Hayes Pullard. This year, Smith has had 13 tackles for a unit that dominated its first two opponents. Head coach Steve Sarkisian expressed his excitement about Smith’s play, comparing the freshman’s ability to that of the former team captain and All-Pac-12 first teamer, Pullard.
“It takes smarts to play that position,” Sarkisian said. “You saw it with Hayes for how many years Hayes did it. And Cam definitely has that, a really good sense and a good feel in there.”
A rib injury to Lamar Dawson, the fifth-year senior who had been projected to start the season at inside backer, gave Smith the chance he needed to impress coaches and perform against Arkansas State — but it’s Smith’s thick frame and nose for the ball that cause him to make such remarkable tackles.
“He got here in spring, and the game hasn’t at all been too big for him. He still has a lot to learn, but I am really encouraged by him. I love his attitude. He is a tough guy, and he tackles,” defensive coordinator Justin Wilcox said.  “I know that you probably think that is a given, but it’s not. He is an instinctual guy who plays inside and who can finish. When he gets his hands on people, he usually gets them on the ground.”
Smith made the 2014 Prep Star All-American Dream Team at Granite Bay High School in Northern California. He was elected to the Cal-Hi Sports All-State first team, MaxPreps All-State Division I first team, USA Today All-California, Orange County Register Fab 15 second team, Tacoma News Tribune Western 100, MaxPreps All-Northern California first team, Max Preps All-Sac-Joaquin first team and Sacramento Bee All-Metro first team as a senior linebacker. Smith recorded 148 tackles, three forced fumbles, two fumble recoveries and four interceptions in 2014.
“He is a very mature young man and a well-rounded, very physical player, who does a good job of embracing that part of the game,” said linebacker coach Peter Sirmon.
But the former All-Pac-10 Conference selection and six year NFL player hesitated when asked to compare Smith to anyone else.
“There are a few things that we have to clean up like every player does,” Sirmon said. “But he has played very productively, and he has not made the same mistakes. So it has been great to see that improvement.”
Smith intercepted 11 passes during his career at Granite Bay, and he continues to pick off passes in practices at USC, which will surely be effective against the array of hurry-up offenses the Trojans will face in the Pac-12 this season.
When asked about Saturday night’s game, Smith seemed to be eager about being on the field in his first Pac-12 game.
“I think it is going to be different,” Smith said. “I feel more passionate because I think it will be more of a college game, and I’m really excited.”

The men’s and women’s tennis teams begin their fall seasons with multiple players from each team nationally ranked.
Having won five of the past seven national championships, the men’s tennis team certainly knows what needs to be done to compete for a national title.
Junior Nick Crystal, who was a freshman when the Trojans last brought home the trophy in 2014, is the highest ranked singles player heading into the opening tournament this year. Crystal is ranked No. 42 in the country.
Crystal has improved his highest ranking from last season, when he was No. 45 in the country for a time. Crystal also earned Pac-12 Honorable Mention honors last year. Though Crystal has experience with what it takes to win, there is one Trojan with slightly more experience than him.
The lone senior of this year’s squad is Max de Vroome.
He begins the season ranked No. 61 in the nation in the singles circuit and No. 47 in doubles,  with freshman Jack Jaede playing alongside him as his partner.
Jaede is not the Trojans’ only freshman, but he is one of four newcomers in addition to sophomore Tanner Smith, who is also in his first year at USC.
For the Women of Troy, four players boast career-high singles rankings heading into preseason play.
All-American senior Giuliana Olmos has broken into the top 10 for the first time in her career and owns the No. 10 ranking in the land to start the year. In addition to her All-American honors, Olmos was also awarded All-Pac-12 First Team honors.
The sophomore triumvirate of Madison Westby, Gabby Smith and Meredith Xepoleas have all upgraded their rankings from the highest point of their freshman campaigns. Westby sits at No. 36, Smith at No. 59 and Xepoleas just behind her at No. 61.
Four freshmen are on a very young roster this season, including Rianna Valdes, who has been ranked as the No. 2 freshman in the nation.
Valdes is paired with Olmos for a high-ranking freshman-senior doubles duo at No. 31 in the country. Just above them are Westby and junior Zoë Katz.
The majority of the men and women will open their 2015 campaigns at the Battle in the Bay in San Francisco from Sept. 17-20. Olmos and Smith, however, will play at the Oracle/ITA Masters in Malibu this weekend.
The Women of Troy are looking to reboot their championship hopes after losing to Vanderbilt in the semifinals of the NCAA championships last year. The men lost to Baylor in the quarterfinals of the NCAA championship.

It’s a common phrase: difficult dilemma. But it’s also wrong — at least in the grammatical sense since a dilemma is, by definition, difficult. It’s what we call a redundant phrase, and they’re rampant in our speech and writing. We crank our phrases like “actual facts,” “added bonuses” and “basic necessities” without realizing that we’re actually repeating ourselves. 
It’s a plague that affects even the most qualified writers like authors, politicians and journalists. No one is immune.
So from a grammatical standpoint, it must spell the end of days for English grammar. It’s a sign that will foretell the demise of written and spoken expression!
Right?
Not really. The English language isn’t going to fail because we add an extra word to another word. 
But it’s still a problem. It has to be! We’re saying it’s OK to say difficult difficult problem or added added benefit. We’re saying it’s OK to be grammatically wrong.
But it isn’t incorrectness that we’re afflicted with, it’s just indifference. We simply don’t mind it enough to change it. We just decided that it’s fine to be redundant. And that’s OK. 
I’m not saying that we should start writing “difficult difficult problem.” But there’s a certain stylistic elegance to redundant phrases that allow for emphasis, the kind of emphasis that is gained from repetition. Redundancy can take a particular part of a word’s definition and make that part more clear and apparent if that is what the writer desires. 
Yes, it’s technically breaking a grammar rule, but we make grammar rules that fit with our needs of language. And our needs change all the time. Remember when it was almost cardinal sin to split an infinitive or to place prepositions at the end of a sentence? These used to be firmly enforced grammar rules that have loosened in recent times to more closely match our desires for language. And the same process can happen to redundant phrases. 
The world isn’t going to end because we like to use redundant phrases. It’s just a sign of changing trends in the English language, changes that we can sympathize with when once we discover the underlying benefits of redundancy. So go ahead, be redundant if necessary. But do it in style.

Companies like Pressed Juicery and Suja Fresh sell the promise of “better living” in a bottle. With trendy packaging and ingredients like kale and coconut water, the appeal of juice cleanses or juice-only diets is obvious. But, juice cleanses are easy to buy into but hard to go through.
Juice cleanses take you on a journey through extreme craving, borderline starvation and irritation. Yet, many of us Trojans see juice cleanses as a way to detox from the weekend or the infamous Freshman 15. While juicing might be better than eating whole fruits and vegetables ­­— it does make plant nutrients more accessible to your body — there are a few precautions to keep in mind to ensure that your juice cleanse healthy and beneficial.
Greens are susceptible to bacterial growth, so if you squeeze your own juice, do not save your juice for later or keep it outside unrefrigerated — getting sick is the opposite of what you want. There is a risk even with store-bought juices. According to the FDA, freshly squeezed drinks are often not pasteurized.
While juices have valuable nutrients, by not eating the whole fruit or vegetable you are losing a significant source of fiber. Keeping the pulp in your juice or buying thicker drinks can add fiber to your cleanse. Fiber also has the added benefit of making you feel more full (and less grumpy).
Many “juicers” tend to avoid heavy foods like carbohydrates and proteins as juice cleanses are a type of weight-loss diet. It is incredibly important, however, to add some protein to your diet. The Greens 1.5, my personal favorite from Pressed Juicery, only has 1 gram of protein. According to the Physicians Committee for Responsible Medicine, the average adult needs 0.36 grams of protein per pound of body weight. Supplement your juice cleanse with white meat, seafood or fat-free yogurt to avoid loss of muscle mass.
Remember that your liver and kidneys naturally remove toxins from your body. According to dietician Manual Villacorta, they are much better detoxing than a juice cleansing would be. Juice cleanses are often temporary, but your liver and kidneys will take you a long way, so treat them kindly. Vegetable juices do help! 
These tips are not meant to stop the juicers from doing juice cleanses, but to make sure that you get the most out of your experience if you do choose to juice-cleanse!
