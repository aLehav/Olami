What exactly is Coachella? At its most basic level, the Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival is a two-weekend music festival held at Empire Polo Club in Indio, Calif. As one of the largest music festivals in the world, it features both top-tier and young, up-and-coming performers, and has launched many small acts to stardom since its inception in 1999. But it is also far more than a music festival; it’s a cultural force that empties Los Angeles and floods Instagram feeds. With tickets starting at a staggering $429, the festival has become a strange signifier of power, privilege and disposable income — a playground in the desert for rich kids and celebrities to play hippie and take MDMA before heading back to their homes Monday morning.

The problematic aspects of Coachella are myriad — the culturally appropriative fashion choices, the lack of pay for lower-rung acts, the Tupac hologram incident — but the most glaring of these is the political leanings of Coachella owner Philip Anschutz. While many go to the Indio desert in the name of music and wealth-enabled youthful freedom, it’s disheartening that many of these Los Angeles liberals fail to realize — or choose to overlook — where their admissions fees are going. Anschutz has an established pattern of using his wealth to support conservative candidates, organizations and super PACs. Many of these donations support anti-LGBTQ, anti-abortion and pro-gun causes, which seem to be at odds with the average Coachella patron’s views.
Coachella was originally started in 1999 by the Los Angeles concert promotion company Goldenvoice. It was then acquired in 2001 by Anschutz Entertainment Group, more commonly known as AEG. AEG is run by Anschutz, a 78-year-old oil tycoon who donates millions to conservative causes every year. While Anschutz makes money off Beyoncé’s headlining performance (and what a performance it was), he also follows the example of the infamous Koch brothers in tipping the political scales by funding ultra-conservative super PACs and candidates.
A brief tour of Anschutz’s donations in 2017: $33,000 given to the Republican Congressional Committee; $70,000 to the Republican Senate Committee; $5,000 to current National Security Advisor John Bolton’s super PAC; and donations to the campaigns of Republican lawmakers Paul Ryan, Scott Tipton and Cory Gardner. Between 2010 and 2013, he also donated a total of $190,000 to anti-LGBTQ groups like Alliance for Freedom, the National Christian Foundation and the Family Research Council. After Rolling Stone reported on these donations, Anschutz said that he “supports the rights of all people without regards to orientation,” and his foundation stopped donating to these groups. But he has continued to donate to Republican and Libertarian candidates who oppose same-sex marriage.
In today’s political landscape, donations like the ones that Anschutz makes can be incredibly impactful on policy. The Supreme Court ruled in 2010 that donations toward political advertising could not be federally regulated; since then, political discourse has been dominated by political action committees and so-called “dark money” organizations. These groups spend enormous amounts of money to sway voters in key markets, and they are much better funded on the right than the left. Phillip Anschutz is a member of the upper echelons of conservative political donors — the 42nd most prolific single donor in the 2016 election — and by giving large sums of money to Goldenvoice and AEG every year, Coachella participants seem to be shooting themselves in the foot politically.
Surely, there are arguments to be made about the value of Coachella. It can be a sustaining paycheck for small artists, it’s a godsend for fans of live music and, in all honesty, it looks like fun. But the hypocrisy of thousands of young liberals (many of whom proudly attended the Women’s March only a few months ago) funneling their money to a man who seems to be their political opposite is striking. The fact that the people who have so much spending power and social capital choose to avoid the political implications of their choices by effectively choosing a fun, luxurious weekend in the desert over the causes that they seem to align themselves with is incredibly frustrating.
Although “voting with your dollar” can only get one so far, it is disappointing to see the sheer number of liberal-minded celebrities, influencers and peers go to Coachella without a second thought. The case of Coachella, along with other events (including country festival Stagecoach) should serve as a sobering reminder that the things we buy can affect the world at large, sometimes in ways that we would never expect. In a capitalist society, it is impossible, or at least exhausting, to only give money to ethical companies and causes, but hopefully the larger picture behind Coachella can give us pause about our spending habits and the inherent politics behind them.

Every once in a while, a viral video unleashes a tirade of discussion, social critiques and news. And I’m not talking about the Walmart yodeling kid or the condom snorting challenge that left parents concerned about their teens. Viral, socially important content online could be the redeeming factor of social media. It fosters social responsibility and citizen consciousness in situations where one feels powerless or experiences bystander apathy. 
Since Thursday, a viral Twitter video depicting the arrest of two black men in a Starbucks has caught the attention of the internet and has been a primary focus of the latest news cycle. The reason behind the arrest was unclear; footage showed a witness approaching the police as they handcuffed the two men and questioning the justifications for their actions. 
Several other individuals in the video’s background also acknowledged that they had not witnessed the two men commit any wrongdoing during their time in the store. It was later revealed that the store’s managers reported the men for trespassing, since they were sitting in the store without purchasing anything. 
If not for the Twitter video’s virality, it’s possible that the arrest would have been overlooked as just another incident — by police, Starbucks employees and witnesses. In these moments, social media opened up the possibility not only for citizen journalism, but also for social responsibility. 
Melissa DePino, the woman who posted the original video on Twitter, saw the arrest as blatantly racist and explained the situation in her tweet. Individuals who saw the post in their newsfeeds recognized the implications of the actions committed in the Starbucks and felt it was their responsibility to share it with their followers. 
On a smaller scale, social media also fosters corporate responsibility. Most corporations have active social media accounts, tracking direct communication between them and consumers’ attitudes toward their brands. It’s become relatively easy to start online campaigns, and many users have taken advantage of Twitter hashtags to boycott companies for their policy views, sponsors — or in Starbucks’ case — its employees’ actions that demonstrate implicit racism.
As the video gained attention online, Starbucks tweeted that it was “reviewing the incident.” On Monday, Starbucks CEO Kevin Johnson called the arrest “reprehensible” and stated he would be meeting with the two men who were arrested. According to Johnson, the manager who called the police has also been put on leave.
It’s easy to decry social media, especially when companies as large as Facebook are plagued with scandals and users start to realize the dangerous side of these platforms. 
Posts go viral all the time, but it’s rare for a video to clearly capture social wrongdoings that elicit strong responses from the online community. The Starbucks video demonstrates the existing implicit biases and consequences of racial profiling in our society. 
Starbucks is now considering a change to its training program, with Johnson pledging to start unconscious bias training for new employees. It’s also working to introduce guidelines for store managers when it comes to handling situations that warrant calling the police. 
To people of color, and specifically black people in the U.S., implicit racism — even blatant racism — isn’t a new phenomenon. Following the incident, many have decried Starbucks or described other social situations in which they have been mistreated for their skin color. 
But, it took only one viral video for a billion-dollar corporation to consider improving its employee training program. I’m not saying these programs will fix the structure of implicit racism in society, but it’s a step forward to holding companies accountable and dismantling the systems of power that have gone on unchecked. All it took was a cell phone and a few customers outcrying the “reprehensible” course of actions toward the two men, and the internet responded with outrage.

The USC football team wrapped up spring practices Saturday with a “Spring Showcase” at Oliver Cromwell Field. 
Offense
Redshirt sophomore wide receiver Velus Jones, Jr. appears to be the most worthy receiver to fill by Deontay Burnett’s vacancy after he left USC to declare for the 2018 NFL Draft. Emily Smith | Daily Trojan
One of the hottest topics of spring football was the ongoing search to replace NFL-bound quarterback Sam Darnold. Currently on the roster, the Trojans featured last year’s backup redshirt sophomore Matt Fink, redshirt freshman Jack Sears and redshirt sophomore Holden Thomas. From the start, head coach Clay Helton insisted that a starter wouldn’t be named during the spring but noted that all three quarterbacks improved most on “decision-making and accuracy” throughout the spring season. The quarterback competition will only intensify as the Trojans welcome consensus five-star recruit J.T. Daniels into the mix. Helton also mentioned that Daniels, who reclassified from the class of 2019 to 2018, will participate in practices starting this summer.
On the offensive line and skill positions, a few players set themselves apart. In particular, redshirt sophomore Velus Jones, Jr. stood out as a top contender to replace Deontay Burnett in the slot receiver position. 
“I have a huge opportunity to step up,” Jones said. “This is what I have been preparing and praying for and why I redshirted. It’s my time.” He will also look to be a contributor on special teams as kickoff and punt returner.
The offensive line also improved dramatically throughout spring. Despite receiving criticism  last season, this spring’s unit played together and saw young players stepping up all over. With former left tackle Toa Lobendahn presumably moving back to center, offensive tackles freshman Austin Jackson and redshirt sophomore Clayton Johnston competed extensively to cover the quarterback’s blind side. Though Lobendahn was limited throughout spring, young centers in true freshman Justin Dedich and redshirt freshman Brett Neilon were praised by offensive line coach Neil Callaway for their early success.
Defense
With returning senior stalwarts such as outside linebacker Porter Gustin, inside linebacker Cameron Smith and safety Marvel Tell, it was clear that the Trojans’ defense already has all the tools to be an elite unit next season.
One group that continually drew praise was the defensive backs, led by Iman “Biggie” Marshall. Marshall, who likely would have been drafted had he declared, has returned with a vengeance and new sense of focus and dedication to the game for his senior season. 
“I’ve just started looking at more film and slowing the game down,” Marshall said. “I feel like when I lose, I’m beating myself no one else is beating me.”
His positional coach, Ronnie Bradford, has also taken note of Marshall’s renewed sense of focus this spring. 
“Iman has begun to understand the little things,” Bradford said in late March. “He’s now displaying his leadership capabilities and taking more of that role within his defensive backs group.” 
With myriad impending changes on the offensive side of the ball, USC may have to rely extensively on its defense to lead the way next season.
Future
While USC looked to replace  eight NFL departures with the roster from last year’s Cotton Bowl and early enrollees, more reinforcements are on the way for next season in the form of the No. 4 recruiting class in the nation, according to 24/7 Sports.
Some of the headliners of the group include five-star cornerbacks Olaijah Griffin and Isaac Taylor-Stuart who will look to break into the defensive back rotation come fall. Another monster addition on defense will be inside linebacker Palaie Gaoteote. Gaoteote was rated as the No. 1 inside linebacker in the country, according to 24/7 Sports, and the 15th overall player in the class of 2018.
On offense, USC will not only welcome one Mater Dei legend in Daniels, but also his favorite target in five-star Amon-Ra St. Brown. St. Brown, the brother of former Notre Dame standout Equanimeous and current Stanford receiver Osiris, will look to contribute to the receiving core immediately upon arriving in Los Angeles. St. Brown was the No. 1 rated receiver in the state of California and caught a whopping 18 touchdowns in his final high school season, according to 24/7 Sports.
As expected, some questions remain as USC looks to retool and compete for another Pac-12 title. With the remaining player-run summer workouts as well along with the 25 fall practices, Helton and his staff will look to find answers ahead of their season opener against UNLV Sept. 1.

The USC baseball team continued its inconsistent season, losing its series with the Arizona Wildcats 1-2 at home.
The team lost the first game of the series by a stunning score of 14-2. Arizona’s dangerous lineup jumped all over freshman pitcher Kyle Hurt, scoring at least 2 runs in three of the first four innings. 
Hurt couldn’t locate his pitches. He walked the first two batters in the second inning. The first walked batter scored on a groundout while the second came in on a high pitch that sophomore catcher Blake Sabol couldn’t handle, giving the Wildcats a 4-0 lead.
Both teams scored a run in the third, with Arizona’s coming on a missile from sophomore second baseman Cameron Cannon over the left field wall for a solo home run. In the bottom of the inning, USC was able to muster an RBI on a hit to the right-center gap.
However, after that, the Wildcats blew the game open in the fourth, scoring 5 runs. By this point, Hurt had allowed 8 earned runs and walked five batters in 3.1 innings of work.
With freshman lefty John Beller in relief, the Wildcats didn’t relent. Arizona then scored 10 runs on six hits.
After that, the Wildcats racked up 4 more runs throughout the rest of the game. The Trojans did manage a run in the bottom of the ninth, on an RBI from redshirt sophomore catcher Kaleb Murphy, resulting in a final score of 2-14.
The Trojans returned to face the Wildcats with a bang Saturday, winning 12-2 in their fourth 14-hit effort in the last six games. The Trojans came out on top early, 4-0.
“They went with a 2-0 changeup, so I was just trying to think the other way with the fastball and they doubled up with the changeup,” Sabol said of his home run pitch in a post-game interview with Pac-12 Network. “Luckily, I was able to keep my barrel through the zone long enough to catch it well.”
Much like Arizona did the previous day, USC stepped on their opponent’s neck while they had an advantage, posting 6 runs in the bottom of the third. 
Sabol continued to make an impact on the game, as his sacrifice fly to left field scored Jamal O’Guinn. Finally, Chase Bushor came in to score on junior outfielder Lars Nootbaar’s single, giving the Trojans a 10-0 lead.
Arizona’s only 2 runs of the game came from first baseman Alfonso Rivas III’s single in the sixth. 
It was a team effort at the plate for the Trojans: Eight players scored and five had multiple hits. Both Bushor and Sabol had three RBIs that day, and Sabol’s home run was his second of the season.
“We were relentless,” head coach Dan Hubbs said in a video released on the team’s official Twitter account. 
Junior starting pitcher Solomon Bates continued his strong play, giving up 2 runs on four hits in seven innings pitched. 
“Solomon was really, really good,” Hubbs said. “He just kept putting up zeroes and allowing us to come back in and score some runs.”
Sunday’s game did not feature such substantial scores, and ended in a 4-2 victory for the Wildcats. Arizona scored the first 2 runs off a bloop single with the bases loaded. The Trojans would counter with 2 runs of their own in the sixth. The first came on a Nootbaar single, which scored Sabol and advanced Brandon Perez to third. Perez then scored on a sacrifice fly to center by Dillon Paulson.
But the Wildcats came back with two more runs in the seventh. After USC sophomore pitcher Chris Clarke came into the game with runners on first and second, a wild pitch and a sacrifice fly led to the final score of 4-2 in favor of the Wildcats. 
Once again, the Trojans showed flashes of greatness but couldn’t put it all together for a whole series. With next weekend’s series at No. 13 UCLA, the Trojans need to find consistency. USC will have two weekday games against UC Santa Barbara and Loyola Marymount to prepare for their game against the Bruins.
 
Correction: A previous version of this article stated that the USC Baseball team played in Arizona. The game was at home. The Daily Trojan regrets the error.

Every brand hopes to keep itself profitable by keeping itself new, distinctive and fresh.
Just take a look at any part of the sports world. Nike and Adidas battle for new looks, new technology, new ways to outfit athletes and force their brands onto players, coaches and fans. ESPN and Fox Sports attempt to use new shows, new apps and new in-game features to adapt and cling onto their fluctuating viewer bases. And sports teams are most guilty of this — they use new technology and new athletes to bolster the lineup and new coaches to shake up losing seasons.
But the introduction of “new” to sports leagues isn’t all that typical. The rules of the game stay stable from year to year. Same with the colors and locations of teams (unless you’re a fan of Los Angeles football). Trying to shake up a sports league is typically pretty difficult, as the institutions that govern and control individual teams stay steady and stable even as the way they are consumed adapts and develops.
In the MLS and the NHL, however, the opposite has proven true. And the introduction of new expansion franchises has led to a developed success that should not only be heralded, but also imitated, by any other sports leagues attempting to build, retain and increase success throughout fans both in America and around the world.
In the hierarchy of American sports, both the MLS and the NHL are fighting for a fourth place position. The American love for football, basketball and baseball has left these two sports often feeling like the odd ones out in cities that show undying loyalty and passion for other athletic endeavors. Here and there, that has proven to be untrue, but in the overall scheme of things, the MLS and the NHL have miles to go before they gain a dominant foothold in the terrain of American sports.
Yet somehow, these two leagues have latched onto fanbases through expansion teams in the past two years that have shaken up the leagues themselves, and the host cities’ interests in certain sports as a whole. 
In the MLS, the addition of Los Angeles FC and Atlanta United resulted in massive explosions of fan support, with Atlanta setting MLS records for attendance and LAFC threatening to dethrone the Galaxy — historically the league’s most dominant team — as the top dog in Los Angeles. In the NHL, meanwhile, the introduction of hockey to Las Vegas led the city on a year-long journey from not having a roster to support a team to dominating the Kings in the first three games of the NHL playoffs.
In both cities, the keys to success have been simple: Know your audience and latch onto them tightly. Each of these cities is different. Atlanta was a city strongly rooted in its traditional American sports, yet with a booming youth soccer scene just waiting to be tapped into a supporter base for a professional team. Los Angeles was a city with an already established MLS team that had somehow missed a major demographic of majority Latinx soccer fans who live Downtown and felt disconnected from the polished club. Las Vegas was a city stocked with sports fans who were starved for a team to cheer for.
Since their inaugural seasons — Atlanta United last year, LAFC and the Knights this year — each of these expansion teams has showcased the ways in which hockey and soccer continue to grow on the outskirts of the American sports teams. They also demonstrate the values that teams in the MLB, NFL and NBA must continue to accept and rotate around fans in order to garner off-the-field (or off-the-court) success.
Ultimately, these teams will have a lot to prove before becoming mainstays at the top of their respective leagues. But if there’s anything to learn from these expansion programs, it’s that the power of the fans can’t be underestimated. And once fans are locked in, it’s hard to break that momentum.

I was at work Monday when I found out Kendrick Lamar won the Pulitzer Prize for Music. I watched the live stream from my phone and my jaw just about hit the floor when Pulitzer administrator Dana Canedy impishly smiled as she announced the “HUMBLE” musician as this year’s recipient. As an avid classical music fan, I was expecting a far more conservative choice from the classical music realm to prevail — someone like Ted Hearne or even Thomas Adès. The formula for these types of prizes tends to favor those who contribute to classical music, not to mention white, cisgender men. I, along with many others, found Lamar’s win to be an absolute surprise, though not an unwelcome one.
Like many prize organizations, there are no sub-genres in music categories, meaning there aren’t separate prizes for, say, classical and non-classical genres; everything is grouped together. And this isn’t exactly common knowledge either, seeing as the honors are notoriously granted to classical composers, with jazz musicians recognized sporadically. When the Pulitzer committee added Music to its list of categories in 1943, it was exclusive to classical music. It wasn’t until 1998 that music of all genres would be considered. Wynton Marsalis was the first non-classical musician to take the Music prize with his 1997 album Blood on the Fields. Following Marsalis’ victory, the tide began to change for this category as jazz became the only other contender. However, Lamar’s win for DAMN. was the tsunami that broke the norm for classical music.
The Pulitzer committee awarded Lamar the prize based on “its vernacular authenticity and rhythmic dynamism that offers affecting vignettes capturing the complexity of modern African-American life.” Working for a classical music nonprofit organization, my office was abuzz with opinions about the controversial win. The general consensus was positive from colleagues around my age who, ironically, don’t actually listen to classical music. In fact, there was only minimal distaste for Lamar’s win within my circle of peers. And though I was elated by Lamar’s victory, I honestly can’t name a Kendrick Lamar song to save my life. I actually had to Google a list of his singles in order to make this piece more cohesive. But my excitement for this gargantuan triumph has nothing to do with Lamar himself — it is more about how this victory will change the music industry.
Shideh Ghandeharizadeh | Daily Trojan
I appreciate all types of music, even genres I unknowingly ignore. As a classical music professional, I thought I had a clear grasp of what is considered “good” music. But this turn of events has shifted everything I have thought to be true about the music business, and Lamar’s win has changed the standard for what makes “good” music, at least from a critics’ standpoint. I’ve spent most of my budding professional career trying to establish myself as a music critic, shying away from the more mainstream beats of pop and hip-hop. I realize now how much of a disservice this has been for myself and my musical knowledge. I was so concerned with being perceived as “high brow” that now my forehead has wrinkles. I forgot why people turned to music in the first place. 
Music is supposed to serve as an escape from the ugly, a giant middle finger to an oppressive society that targets the underdog. In an attempt to foster my own career, I abandoned this mantra because music should have little to do with accolades. And to briefly play devil’s advocate, Lamar’s win shouldn’t even matter — who is the Pulitzer committee to decide what is considered the “best”? All music is created equal, but these judgements should be personal, not universal. The Pulitzer committee’s decision to award Lamar has everything and nothing to do with this philosophy.
I cannot emphasize enough how important Lamar’s win is for the music industry. On a more personal note, it was an intense wake-up call for me to acknowledge and celebrate all types of music, not just those written by cis, white men from the 18th and 19th centuries. Classical music isn’t dying because people aren’t interested. It’s dying because its composers and critics are unwilling to explore the unknown. That was the case until today.

The Butcher, the Baker, and the Cappuccino Maker, or BBCM for short, opened its doors in USC Village last week, welcoming coffee enthusiasts, casual brunchers, aesthetic atmosphere appreciators and students seeking a social studying environment. From its flagship location on Sunset Boulevard in West Hollywood, BBCM has brought the concept of the all-day cafe to the heart of USC.
BBCM is an all-day cafe offers a variety of menu options that are suitable for breakfast, lunch or dinner, such as coffee, pastries, croissants, eggs, sandwiches and avocado toast. Emily Smith | Daily Trojan
Café culture is on the rise in urban areas like New York and Los Angeles. It’s not unusual to start your day sipping a latte and typing away at a laptop, then meeting a friend for a chat in the same café over lunch, and around dinner time finally tucking away your work as the cafe transitions into a dining and bar destination. BBCM is USC’s taste of an all-day café affair. It boasts a varied menu of everything from breakfast pastries to heavier fare like pizzas, pastas and seafood entrees. 
USC’s BBCM is bright and open, but also has a cozier atmosphere, as it is classily cluttered. The space is an irregular shape with a few too many corners since it is on the edge of the Village, but the interior works well with the shape: The walls are cleverly lined with bookshelves, which offer a variety of (real) books on a vast assortment of topics from former President Harry Truman to detective thriller novels. Among the books are several other curios, including a vintage typewriter, globe and USC memorabilia. 
There is a coffee roaster slowly churning beans in the corner of the room, and the scent of the dark roast mixes with the heady scent of baking dough. Their coffee menu replete with mochas, lattes, cappuccinos, espressos leaves nothing to be desired, and there is even one cold brew for each roast the cafe offers. Their coffee is generally not as sweet as Dulce’s, which is just across the Village, but their beans are also third wave and just as smooth as the Ritual beans Dulce brews. BBCM’s iconic drink is the colorburst latte, the perfect complement to any Instagram feed, though at the steep cost of $7. BBCM also serves mimosas all day — a glass is $10, or a sampler of three different mimosas (orange, hibiscus and strawberry) is $14.
Along the inner wall is a pastry and dessert display case, which customers line up against as they wait to place their orders. To the left of the cashier, the wall shifts into a bar, paneled with mirrors and lined with wine glasses and pitchers. The bar seats are empty in the early morning hours, save for a few students utilizing the outlets, but they fill up as the cafe gets busier. Along the opposite wall are smaller tables, some paired with bright yellow couches that are a pop of color against the white walls and dark wood accents. Along the middle of the restaurant runs a long, marbled communal table, which perfectly complements the marbled plates and baby blue and white speckled coffee cups. 
The breakfast menu consists of a variety of eggs, sandwiches and brunch dishes. A popular item is the Butcher’s eggs benedict ($15), two buttermilk biscuits topped with your choice of smoked salmon, pork belly or avocado, and of course, two beautifully cooked eggs. There is also the option of ordering sides: salad or breakfast potatoes.The flavor pairings of egg, salmon and hollandaise sauce satisfy both the tastebuds and the appetite. The salmon is fresh, though it can be cooked slightly longer until the texture is crunchy, a complement to the eggs. The avocado, however, does not contrast the eggs as well, leaving one with a thick, unexciting flavor. 
At a pricey $9, BBCM’s avocado toast — now a staple millennial dish — is a single thick slice of whole wheat toast, slathered in ripe avocado and topped with thinly sliced radish, sunflower seeds, peppers and cilantro. It comes with a complimentary egg, thick and runny, but served to your preference. While the portion appears small, it is very filling. Beyond breakfast, there are plenty of sandwiches, salads, pastas, seafood dishes and pizzas to choose from. The croissant sandwich ($13) and the eggs benedict pizza ($15) cleverly blur the lines between breakfast and lunch, boosting BBCM’s reputation as a brunch destination.
Like many of the restaurants in USC Village, BBCM is on the more expensive side — a meal and coffee can range from $15-$30, and a light breakfast of just coffee and pastries or a muffin still adds up to about $10. USC’s BBCM operates on a seasonal menu; as the weather warms up, items will change, though their coffee and baked goods will always be menu staples. BBCM is located on the intersection of Hoover Street and Jefferson Boulevard, and is open daily from 7 a.m. to 10 p.m.

Samuel Cohen, a senior majoring in health promotion and disease prevention, wanted to go beyond learning in classrooms by gaining work experience in Los Angeles. With aspirations of becoming a pediatric orthopaedic surgeon, he joined the Mobile Clinic at USC student organization as a sophomore to supplement his college education by giving back to the community.

“At USC, we’re in a location where we have such an opportunity to really make a difference within the community and so that’s why this was a way for me to get clinical experience,” Cohen said. “As much as learning in a textbook, to me, one of the best parts about USC was being able to go out and do meaningful work in the community.”
USC Mobile Clinic is a student organization where undergraduates work alongside USC medical students, physicians, pharmacists, occupational therapists and other health professionals to deliver medical care and provide for the needs of Los Angeles’ homeless population. 
Since the organization’s launch in Spring 2016, mobile clinics have been set up at different homeless shelters where patients can go to receive primary care check-ups. According to USC Mobile Clinic Vice President Courtney Cho, many patients within the homeless population in particular  do not have access to primary care doctors.
“Being at the shelters, especially exposed to various illnesses and because a lot of them spend their days at the shelter or wander around looking for jobs, the population itself is more prone to contracting diseases,” said Cho, a junior majoring in human biology. “Having a primary care doctor is important to ensure they have good health.”
According to Cohen, patients are seen by an occupational therapist during their primary check-up. During this appointment, they are evaluated for possible approaches and treatments. The medical students help the attending physicians with determining the situation and if the patient should be referred to a specialized medic for a follow-up appointment. 
Cohen said that because patients have access to these appointments from the shelters, the follow-up attendance rate was about 15 percent. In order to help increase attendance by making transportation for patients more convenient, Cohen created the Advocate Care Program within the USC Mobile Clinic in Spring 2017. According to Cohen, since the program was started, the patient attendance rate has increased to 95 percent.
“So I started this program where we, as undergraduates, help get these patients to their doctor’s appointment,” Cohen said. “We would take public transportation, go to the shelter, pick up the patient, bring them to their doctor’s appointment, check them in, and then set them up with transportation to go back home.” 
Although the organization used this model for a while, the system became inefficient due to the unreliability of public transportation and student volunteers’ conflicting class schedules.
Last week, Uber made a deal with the organization to provide free transportation for patients and volunteers to and from the clinics. 
In addition to the Advocate Care Program, USC Mobile Clinic also runs the Shelter Days program, where students bring in board games and hygiene kits — including toiletries such as shampoo, deodorant and feminine products — to shelters.
“We go in and we play games with our patients and get to build relationships and a sense of camaraderie with them,” said Joshrick Sablan, a sophomore majoring in human biology who is a member of the organization. “That way, they’re a lot more comfortable with us when we provide our health care clinics.”
Sablan said he hopes that USC Mobile Clinic will grow in the future and expand its outreach to the homeless community in the Greater Los Angeles area. 
“As undergraduates, we don’t yet have the medical expertise to provide medical care, but we can do the next best thing by ensuring that patients can actually go to the doctors who have the training to treat them and thereby ensure the continuity of care that they deserve,” Cohen said.

In March, 21-year-old Kris Boesen was driving on a wet road in Maricopa, Calif., when his car suddenly fishtailed out of control into a tree and a telephone pole. As a result of the accident, Boesen broke his neck, was no longer able to walk and could only move his left arm up and down. Both of his hands were stuck in a clenched position.
Charles Liu, director of the USC Neurorestoration Center, operated on Kris Boesen (above), who has a spinal cord injury, by using stem cells to repair and replace damaged tissue. Photo from USC News.
“I was barely existing,” Boesen told the USC Keck School of Medicine News. “I wasn’t really living my life.”
In early April, Charles Liu, director of the USC Neurorestoration Center, performed a procedure on Boesen, who has been affected by severe spinal cord injuries, to help him gain independence. 
Liu’s procedure is part of a clinical trial aimed at improving the lives of patients with similar conditions as Boesen’s. The trial, which is taking place at five other clinical sites, is sponsored by the California Institute for Regenerative Medicine through Asterias Biotherapeutics.
The operation Liu outlined for Boesen used stem cells, or “blank slate” cells that can help repair or replace damaged tissue. Keck said these cells have the potential to become multiple types of cells. 
According to the news release, nearly 100 scientists, doctors and engineers are part of the USC Stem Cell Initiative, which investigates different therapies and applications involving stem cells. USC researchers have received millions of dollars in grants from the California Institute for Regenerative Medicine.
“This is to bring people together who are working in the area of stem cells,” Andy McMahon, who leads one of the labs within the initiative, told the Keck School of Medicine.
However, despite the amount of effort put into researching the effects of stem cells, Liu said there are dangers in stem cell therapy. He told Boesen’s family that Boesen could lose the remaining arm movement he had before the treatment. Stem cell therapy can also result in the formation of a tumor. 
After weeks on a ventilator, Boesen consented to the treatment.
A month after his accident, Liu and a team of surgeons operated on the back of Boesen’s neck at the Keck Medical Center of USC. They stopped his breathing in order to prevent his lungs from moving his spinal cord during respiration, and injected 10 million stem cells into the tough membrane surrounding his spinal cord.
Soon, Boesen regained some motor skills. He could lift weights, write his name, operate a motorized wheelchair and independently feed himself. Currently, Boesen is back at home and hopes to return to a more independent life.
According to the news release, Boesen is a special case among thousands of patients who suffer from paralytic conditions. His recovery is significantly different from those of other patients who receive similar treatments, according to Liu. Although the treatment is unlikely to allow Boesen to walk again, his arm movement can be improved significantly. 
“All of this wouldn’t have been possible without the stem cells,” Boesen told the Keck School of Medicine’s news site.
According to the release, USC researchers are looking to expand research and double the dosage of stem cells involved in the treatment for patients with spinal cord injuries. USC has already considered clinical trials exploring stem cell-based treatments for HIV/AIDS, Alzheimer’s disease, the dry form of age-related macular degeneration, osteoarthritis in the knee and immune system damage due to chemotherapy.
“Because the therapies would replace damaged tissue with new, healthy tissue, treatments would provide true cures,” McMahon said.

Stress is a part of every college student’s life, but between midterms, finals and papers it’s easy to neglect your mental health in favor of that elusive A. The Engemann Student Health Center offers students with various mental health resources, but there are also alternative support systems available here at USC. Here’s a list of helpful resources outside of Engemann:
USC Office of Religious Life (USC ORL)
For those who take solace in prayer, USC’s Office of Religious Life houses more than 90 religious organizations and offers opportunities for students to connect with each other as well as with faculty through monthly talks like “What Matters to Me and Why.” However, their services don’t stop at prayer and spirituality — the Office of Religious Life is also partnered up with 12-step programs like Alcoholics Anonymous that help tackle addiction. Their unique partnership with the LGBT Resource Center also allows students to challenge stereotypes and explore the intersections of spirituality and sexuality, which are often thought of as being in contention with each other.
Contact them at orl@usc.edu or at (213) 740-6110.
If meditation in silence is more your thing, consider visiting the Little Chapel of Silence, located on the northwest corner of Town & Gown and just behind the SAS building. It’s open from 6:30 a.m. to 10 p.m. every day and has served as a place for the USC community to think, pray and reflect since 1935. If you’re feeling particularly inspired, write down a prayer or reflection on a slip of paper to put in a prayer box or jot your thoughts down on the notebook at the front altar.
Corepower Yoga (USC Village)
Research has shown time and time again that exercise helps with both physical and mental health. But for those of us who don’t really feel like breaking a sweat on the treadmill, low-impact exercises like yoga and Pilates center the mind as well as ground the body. Yoga in particular focuses mostly on breathing and body awareness, which can help alleviate symptoms of anxiety by quieting the mind and banishing persistent intrusive thoughts. It’s also incredibly beginner-friendly, so grab your mat and head over to Corepower for your daily dose of feel-good hormones.
Contact them at (866) 441-YOGA to set up a class.
With organizations like Queer and Ally Student Assembly, Transgender Advocacy Group and a complete and comprehensive list of all the gender-neutral restrooms at USC, the LGBT Resource Center serves as a platform for all students to feel accepted, regardless of orientation or identification. They have the lowdown on graduate and undergraduate organizations and interest groups, information to help with coming out and referrals to neighboring LGBTQ+ support resources. Check it out here: http://lgbtrc.usc.edu/
Contact them at (213) 740-7619 or at lgbt@usc.edu.
Office of International Services (OIS)
Seventeen percent of USC’s student body comprises citizens of over 130 countries. Leaving home is always hard, however, time differences and Thanksgiving breaks spent on campus mean that international students often have to face a set of problems that are unique to being far away from home. USC’s Office of International Services seeks to mitigate just those problems. They offer on-campus coffee breaks, international student career fairs, English-language instruction and free opportunities to explore L.A. to make international students feel as much at home as possible.
Professor Beau, the Wellness Dog
No article about wellness at USC is complete without a mention of Professor Beau, USC’s first (and hopefully not last) full-time canine staff member. You can visit this professionally trained Golden Doodle at his office hours on Tuesday and Thursday at 12-1 pm and 11:20 am to 12:30 p.m. respectively at the Student Wellness Lounge (ESH 203). You can even request a visit from him by filling out a form here (https://uscstudentaffairs.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_cIb3ahQuB5adN8p). Plus, he’s hypoallergenic!)
All these resources are here to remind you that you are valuable, and your presence is valuable, even if you may be feeling stressed about your looming finals schedule. The people (and dogs) working tirelessly to better your experience at USC are here to listen to you, and help you through finals week.

As college students, we’re all struggling to juggle the demands of our academics, extracurriculars and social life. Add bad eating habits into the equation and the consequent fatigue, moodiness and lack of focus, and this delicate balance collapses like a poorly played game of Jenga. Here are some tips to help you stay on track with healthy eating to improve your college experience:
Not only will you feel cranky and irritable, but also you’ll just end up overeating when you finally get the chance to eat. If you don’t have the time to sit down for a full meal, eat energy-boosting snacks throughout the day so you’re not running on empty.
By nixing all-nighters and creating a set time to wake up and go to sleep, your body will get on a regular rhythm so that your body will signal hunger at the same times each day, which can help prevent excessive snacking. Getting regular sleep also helps reduce cravings.
Avoid unhealthy and pseudo-healthy foods. Seemingly innocent fare like yogurt, granola and bread can be packed with added sugars, and even a nutritious salad can be sabotaged by dressings laden with preservatives and artificial ingredients.
It’s no secret that an unadorned bowl of vegetables, while packed with important vitamins and minerals, can be a little boring. Bolstering a healthy but bland meal with spices can make it more palatable and even help you resist cravings. Buy a seasoning mix (preferably one with no sodium) and bring it with you to the dining halls to give your meals some added pizzazz. Pro tip: certain spices, like turmeric and cinnamon, have metabolism-boosting powers.
Try to avoid doing other tasks while eating meals, even if you’re in a time crunch. You will be more aware of when you are full, which will help keep you from overindulging, and by savoring the food you are putting in your body, you will feel more satisfied. 
Just because you live in a dorm with no kitchen and a strict no-cooking-appliance policy doesn’t mean that you’re totally at the mercy of the dining halls to provide you with meals. There are a plethora of healthy microwave recipes, from oatmeal and scrambled eggs to burrito bowls and kale chips!

This might seem like a no-brainer, but when you’re always on the go it can be easy to lapse into a vending machine diet of peanut M&Ms and spicy Cheetos. Trader Joe’s has tons of cheap produce; grab a bag of carrots or a carton of blueberries to stow in your backpack for the next time you have the munchies.
If you have a small hoard of unhealthy snacks in your room, try to make healthy swaps that give you a similar feeling of satisfaction. Instead of chips and cookies, try some Boom Chicka Pop popcorn and dark chocolate.
If you are lucky enough to have a kitchen in your dorm, making a huge batch of rice, chicken and vegetables on the weekend and storing them in the freezer is the easiest way to ensure you’ll have a week of healthy meals. Plus, cooking is a great excuse to relax in your dorm and watch Netflix. 
Even if you’re on a meal plan, this is an easy way to ensure that you’re not tempted to eat the unhealthy foods offered by the dining halls. Some of my favorite staples to pack are hard-boiled eggs, rice cakes with cheese, apples with peanut butter, yogurt with granola and veggies with hummus.

Last week, Facebook founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg faced an angry and unrelenting Congress that grilled him on everything from whether Facebook is the same as Twitter to how Facebook makes money.
Shideh Ghandeharizadeh | Daily Trojan
But more baffling than the questions our legislators lobbed at Zukerberg remains our own outrage over breaches of digital privacy that have always existed, but have only recently drawn lasting attention.
In an age when instant gratification trumps scrutiny, it isn’t surprising that no one reads user agreements. Granted, it’s not as if user agreements as lengthy or complicated as Facebook’s could be digestible to anyone but seasoned lawyers. And yet, it should still be surprising that in 2018, for us millennials, indignation and absolving ourselves of responsibility still go hand-in-hand.
From the soaring costs of college to skyrocketing housing markets, we millennials know that nothing in life is truly free. Therefore, there should have been little doubt that every time we updated our statuses, posted pictures and liked and shared content, there would be some consequence — in this case, the selling of our information.
Russian meddling and disinformation aside, Facebook and other companies did not necessarily betray us when what we considered private went public. Rather, we betrayed ourselves throughout the last decade in failing to scrutinize our use of social media and its potential impact.
Social media has been damaging in skewing our understandings of not only content sharing but also news dissemination, and our perceptions of ourselves as making positive differences.
 According to a 2016 study by Stanford University, a plurality of high school students couldn’t tell real and fake news sources apart on Facebook. Additionally, the study noted: “Most college students didn’t suspect potential bias in a tweet from an activist group,” and “most Stanford students couldn’t identify the difference between a mainstream and fringe source.”
This study reflects a greater and more concerning trend. From 2012 to 2017, only a fifth of millennials reported trust in Congress, but despite improving from previous years, our generation’s voter turnout still lags behind other generations’ by double-digit points.
And though we rank environmental sustainability as a top concern, our generation is on track to eat just as much meat as Generation X. Despite nearly half of millennials identifying climate change as the most serious and pressing global issue, 15 percent of millennials said they had made no effort to help the environment. And even worse, 78 percent of young baby boomers and 71 percent of young Generation X members reported that they cut back on heating fuel, as opposed to 56 percent of millennials.
Closer to home, as members of a university like USC, it remains to be seen if student outrage over gentrification has translated into more activism, service hours or community outreach.
These examples paint a bleak picture in which our indignation stops at social media posts and soundbites, but too often even spirals into behavior that betrays our very same convictions.
In the case of social media, the “March for Our Lives” movement has reconceptualized the tools of the internet, refocusing on sharing instead of selling information. It has rallied thousands behind the notion that brief spouts of angry tweets after tragedy aren’t enough. This particular social movement has revealed to young people how they must follow through with action and activism.
Our country was founded upon the notion of  “no taxation without representation.” But only five millennials occupy seats in Congress. Millennials hold a mere 5 percent of seats in state legislatures across the nation. However, young people have been answering the call all across the country, from Stockton Mayor Michael Tubbs, elected to office at the age of 26, to the almost 11,000 millennials who have asked about running for state and local office through the organization Run for Something. Action is being taken.
Now, projected to become the largest generation in the country, we bear the largest responsibility. What makes us enraged must compel us to become engaged. If not, the selling of our information will seem a small price to pay.

Earlier this month, a student at the University of Chicago was shot in the shoulder by a campus police officer. Predictably, students, activists and community members held a demonstration following the incident calling for the disarmament of the University of Chicago Police Department. 
They delivered a letter of demands to the president of the university and threatened to stop student and alumni donations until the university complied. This question is being raised not only on the University of Chicago’s campus, but also on USC’s: Should private campus police forces like the University’s Department of Public Safety be disarmed because some feel this would make students safer?
The answer: absolutely not.
The safety benefits of an armed campus force far outweigh the risk of injuring a student — a fact demonstrated by the University of Chicago itself. Furthermore, there is a demonstrable need for DPS to be armed on USC’s campus.
First of all, the shooting appears to be justified. Video footage depicts the student charging at the retreating officer with a metal pipe after being told to drop his weapon. The student has been charged with felony aggravated assault of a peace officer and two counts of felony criminal damage to property, according to Chicago police. 
The shooting on the Chicago campus was also extremely rare. According to the Chicago Tribune, this shooting was the first by a university department officer in over 30 years, during which roughly half a million students attended the school. According to The Atlantic, the percentage of campuses using armed officers — both public and private — has increased from 68 percent to 75 percent since the 2004-05 school year. The number of students shot by university police in the last three decades is about two millionths of one percent (.000002). To make a statistical anomaly the rallying point for policy change is absurd.
There is no evidence that students would be safer if University of Chicago officers were disarmed. Likewise, with a campus three times the size of the University of Chicago and therefore prone to more cases of violent crime, USC would benefit from a trained police force that is well-prepared to respond to any threats of violence. Right now, most of USC DPS is equipped with tasers instead of guns. 
When one considers USC’s geographical location, the need for an armed police force on campus is even more apparent. Over the last six months, there have been 289.5 crimes per 10,000 people in the University Park area — a crime rate higher than nearby Downtown, Pico-Union, Exposition Park, Historic South-Central and Adams-Normandie, per data from the Los Angeles Times. The higher crime rate in South L.A. when compared to the rest of Los Angeles necessitates an armed police force with a quick response time to adequately protect the mass of unarmed students.
According to the Bureau of Justice Statistics, nearly 70 percent of colleges and universities operated full law enforcement agencies in 2012, and 94 percent of those officers were authorized to use a firearm. Our university is among them. The overwhelming majority of higher education institutions agree that an armed campus police force is an effective way to keep their students safe. 
Though the chance that a campus police officer will injure a student is unlikely, it is still a legitimate concern for some. To address this apprehension, the University’s DPS requires all armed officers to pass an extensive screening process and background check, as well as graduate from the police academy. They must then complete a field training program before they can work alone. And DPS Chief John Thomas has recently added annual trainings to enhance the department’s professional skills and knowledge. These measures reduce the probability of accidents and instill trust in the department.
A well-trained, well-led campus police force is an effective means of protecting students, and the notion that they pose a danger to university students is unfounded. Arming the University’s police officers is not just beneficial — it’s necessary. Failing to do so would endanger more students, increase law enforcement response time and decrease protection in a neighborhood that needs it.

Science advocates and enthusiasts gathered in Pershing Square in downtown Los Angeles Saturday to bring awareness to the importance of science in different aspects of society, calling for evidence-based policy-making and encouraging young people to engage with science.
Design by Karan Nevatia | Daily Trojan
This year’s March for Science Los Angeles did not include an actual march. Rather, it was a rally in Pershing Square with various speakers. Ralliers held signs with slogans like “You can’t comb over climate change,” “The oceans are rising and so are we” and “Science is not fake news.”
The rally also featured an exposition with booths on display for attendees. The booths featured different science experts, booths with physics games for children and voter registration drives for the upcoming midterm elections. 
Speakers focused on different aspects of science in the community, including the role of science in policy-making, science as a tool to reduce gun violence and the idea that “we are all scientists.” Carlos Gutierrez, a professor of chemistry and biochemistry at Cal State Los Angeles, said science brings people to ask questions, and allows them to regain their voices.
“I march for science because science belongs to all of us, not only to professional scientists,” Gutierrez said. “If you can ask a question, imagine possible answers and let evidence guide you to the most likely solution, you are a scientist.” 
USC Keck School of Medicine professor Mona Patel, who practices as a physician at Children’s Hospital Los Angeles, spoke about the importance of science to inform policy. 
In December, President Donald Trump’s administration banned the Center for Disease Control and Prevention from using seven words in their reports, including “diversity,” “transgender,” “evidence-based” and “fetus.” Patel spoke of the need to use these words in official reports.
“These are core words that we use in science every single day […] that can affect grant-making and research and further initiatives to really promote and continue science,” Patel said. “We shouldn’t be making policy without evidence and data.”
One of the speakers, Yadira Valadez, serves as the ambassador for TechnoloCHICAS, a company that empowers Latinas to work in the technology field. At the event, Valadez spoke about the need for intersectionality and inclusivity of young people in science.
“This is a call to action to leaders across all fields to recognize the power of our youth,” Valadez said. “Technology should be compassionate and our youth have the ability to be catalysts of the change we all here presently are demanding.”
A large portion of the event was focused on engaging the younger generation of attendees. Booths demonstrating what “fake science” looks like as well as games demonstrating the basic laws of physics are just a few examples of how the rally catered to children and young people. 
A group of students from Diamond Bar High School worked a booth with games to encourage children to learn about physics through fun activities. Rajvir Dua, a high school senior who plans to attend USC in the fall, believes it is important for children to interact with science. 
“When most people think of science, especially physics, there’s a lot of stigma that it’s for universities or professors or some really complicated rocket scientist,” Dua said. “The simple principles are applicable in everyday life and it’s very simple for little kids to understand.”
Many children were present with signs of their own. Anahita Sanati, an art teacher and yoga instructor, brought her 7-year-old daughter Olivia to experience the rally.
“It brings my child here and she can tell other children,” Sanati said. “It opens awareness and more minds and maybe through our experiences, we can inspire others to think before they vote.”
Sanati said it is important for people to vote with consideration of science-based evidence. She brought her daughter to show her that there are like-minded people who will stand up for what they believe is right. Olivia Sanati said she likes science and is inspired by her grandfather, who worked as a chemical engineer.
“It’s fun mixing stuff up and making a mess,” she said. “I might actually be a chemical engineer when I grow up.”

As the oldest student organization at USC, the Trojan Debate Squad has more than 70 members — and some of these students are making their mark on the national stage.
Seniors Aron Berger and Hex Larsen were both given Cross Examination Debate Association National Debate Scholar summa cum laude awards for academic excellence. Photo courtesy of Kiran Dhillon.
This year, two USC seniors received the highest honors in national debate tournaments for their academic excellence, debate success and contributions to the community.
Hex Larsen, a senior majoring in gender studies, and Aron Berger, a senior majoring in philosophy, politics and law, received several recognitions at this year’s Cross Examination Debate Association National Tournament and the National Debate Tournament.
After the duo competed together in the CEDA National Tournament, Larsen was the first USC debater to be ranked the top speaker in the tournament’s 47-year history.
“I was awarded top speaker out of 150 debaters at the tournament — it’s the largest national championship,” Larsen said. “To be the first USC top speaker of the CEDA tournament is really an honor.”
Larsen was also awarded the CEDA Brian “Baby Jo” Johnston Debater of the Year Award, which recognizes an outstanding debater who demonstrates a commitment to the highest values of the debate community.
“The Debater of the Year award is not just about debate success, but it is also about camaraderie and what it means to be a community member in debate,” Larsen said. “Being awarded was really special to me. It really illuminated the impact I’ve had on others.”
Larsen and Berger, who also compete as a team, were each awarded CEDA National Debate Scholar summa cum laude awards for academic excellence, as well as All American Debate Squad awards for competitive and academic success, good conduct and contributions to the squad.
At the 72nd annual NDT, the duo received an overall yearly ranking of ninth best debate team in the country.
Kiran Dhillon is the Trojan Debate Squad’s first female director, and under her leadership, the team has been ranked in the top 50 teams in the nation for two years in a row.
“I’m really proud of [Larsen and Berger],” Dhillon said. “In the time I’ve been at USC I’ve seen them help to transform the squad.”
When they are not competing, Larsen and Berger participate in community service programs for the Los Angeles Metropolitan Debate League, mentor youth across Los Angeles and coach younger members of the Debate Squad. Larsen and Berger said they plan to continue applying the skills they have learned for the past few years in debate to their work within the community and in their daily lives.
“Because the [debate] topic was about health care this year, throughout the year Aron and I had to have some really serious conversations about what it meant to care for one another and in what ways we were not being caring to one another and to people outside of us,” Larsen said.
Other argument topics of this year included the interconnection between health care and the military and the effect of cleanliness on personal views of health.
“I hope [our work] has a lasting impression on how people in debate care for each other,” Berger said. “ I just think if there’s a topic, there’s an academic obligation to really get at it and interrogate it.”
Dhillon says the two seniors have made their mark on the debate community. 
“There are so many things I’ll remember about [Larsen and Berger],” Dhillon said. “They’ve both been active participants in a larger debate community that sometimes gets stuck in the minutia of competition and forgets about the day-to-day care about one another.”

The department of physiology and biology at the USC Keck School of Medicine was recently ranked third in national researching funding, according to the Blue Ridge Institute. The National Institute of Health contributed $16 million last year.
Photo courtesy of Alex Familian from USC News.
Berislav Zlokovic, the director of the USC Zilkha Neurogenetic Institute, has worked to improve fundraising in his department. 
Before coming to USC, he spent several years working as a professor in both the neurosurgery and neurology departments at the University of Rochester. In 2009, he received the Potamkin Prize for Research in Pick’s, Alzheimer’s and related diseases, and was given a $100,000 award for his breakthrough research in Alzheimer’s disease.
“Zlokovic is recognized worldwide for his pioneering research on the blood vessels in the brain and the crucial role they play in our health,” the University of Rochester reported shortly after he was awarded. “He has made a series of surprising findings that are forming the basis for new avenues of treatment that would complement the stable of medications that doctors now have to treat patients with the disease.”
In 2011, Zlokovic returned to USC with a determination to raise research funding. He worked with researchers to think differently and take risks with new technologies.
“The Zilkha Neurogenetic Institute is home to a particularly talented group of scientists, all of whom contribute to the overall success of the department,” Zlokovic said to USC News. “Without the collective actions of our strong research group, we would not have risen in the ranks as fast as we did.”
He accredits his fellow researchers for their outstanding work that contributed to increases in funding. Ralf Langen, director of the Protein Structure Center, and neuroscientist Terrence Town received a combined $4.3 million over several years.
Additionally, at the Zilkha Neurogenetic Institute, there are multiple investigators with two or three NIH R01 investigator-initiated grants. The R01 provides funding for health-related research based on the NIH mission.
“The Keck School of Medicine’s physiology research efforts have helped the department gel, and the growth of USC’s Zilkha Neurogenetic Institute plays a key part in that,” USC News reported. “Faculty members who worked at the institute once belonged to departments scattered across the Keck School, [Zlokovic] said, but their funding and complete financial support was funneled through the Zilkha Institute instead of their individual departments.”
Organizing researchers together to make collaboration easier, as well as encouraging researchers to test out new territory, has significantly contributed to USC’s rising ranks in funding, USC News said.
“With the support of the faculty, the Keck School of Medicine and the USC community at large, the dean, provost and president, and a remarkable dedication and sponsorship by Selim Zilkha and Mary Hayley, we are now realizing this dream in the Zilkha Neurogenetic Institute all together,” Zlokovic said to USC News.

Kenan Draughorne | Daily Trojan
Of the many artists I’ve been a fan of and supported throughout the years, no one has brought me more stress than Wale. To be a fan of the D.C. rapper is to witness his many thoughtful yet rambling Instagram ventilations, in-house tensions with other members of the MMG roster and the lists and conversations that he’s often either undervalued in or left out of entirely. Now, 13 years removed from the release of his debut mixtape, Wale’s skills as an MC are anything but diminished, yet the rapper has been plagued with a seemingly endless stream of setbacks and frustrations ever since he first began his ascent.
After the birth of his daughter, Wale seemed to find peace. When he released his latest album Shine in 2017, he supposedly left these frustrations in the rearview mirror, and instead opted to reevaluate his list of accomplishments. Sluggish album sales failed to correspond with the impressive quality of the music, however, and today he is once again an independent artist, having split from Atlantic Records after six years and three albums with the label.
It would appear Wale is now back in a precarious position, but he’s responded in the only way he knows how: with a steady stream of solid music. His first release after leaving the label was the melancholic, yet humorous “All Star Break Up,” and since then he’s unveiled the EP “It’s Complicated” along with two other singles, hungry to prove that his career is far from over. Considering other labels have been quick to reach out about a new deal, he certainly has options, a fact he’s quick to express on his recent song “Staying Power:” “Left Atlantic, bout a minute later/Every record label try and scout me.”
Like many of my favorite artists, Wale’s music has remained in my rotation because of a specific memory tied to the material; in this case, my first hip-hop CD purchase. Before attending a summer camp at USC in 2013, a few months after finishing my sophomore year of high school, I bought a copy of his album The Gifted on iTunes to soundtrack the trip, as I’d been mildly familiar with his catalogue up to that point. As I soon graduated to the university of illegal music sharing, The Gifted was also the last album I would ever buy for myself on iTunes, and still is the only full album stored in my phone’s music library. It’s rare that I start my car and connect my phone to the speakers without first hearing the opening notes of the Tiara Thomas-assisted “Bad,” alphabetically the first song on the tracklist.

Both by choice and by compulsion, The Gifted is still close to my heart, and always makes for a pleasant listen-through when the time calls. Just like Wale has, I’ve often lamented how his status in the music industry isn’t quite as high as his talent suggests it should be, although I was happy to hear him content with his career on “Smile.” It’s a massive assumption to say that that joy has disappeared following his departure from his label, but much of his 2018 output has been somewhat of a return to form for Wale — scathing, determined bars from a man on a mission to prove the doubters wrong.
That exact mindset is what initially made it possible for Wale to make it as far as he has, however, so it’s good to see him able to snap back into the underdog mentality when the situation requires it. There’s still no word on where he’ll choose to sign next — assuming he doesn’t remain independent instead — but I have little doubt that he’ll make the right decision, and continue to put out high-fidelity sounds that I will always appreciate.
A Coachella veteran who previously performed in 2012 and 2015, The Weeknd’s third billed appearance at the festival was nothing short of phenomenal. Accompanied by a massive, fractured head that protruded from the stage, Abel Tesfaye ran through nearly all of the hits from his extensive discography, juxtaposing old and new songs to please all fans in attendance. Holding off on songs from the recently released EP “My Dear Melancholy” until near the end of his set, it was clear he saved his most passionate performance for the end, tearing up while singing “Call Out My Name” in front of a transfixed audience.
Why I’m shaking my head: Rae Sremmurd’s perplexing SR3MM rollout
Rae Sremmurd ft. Slim Jxmmi and Swae Lee; Swae Lee ft. Rae Sremmurd; Slim Jxmmi ft. Swae Lee and Rae Sremmurd … first of all, is it even possible to “feature” yourself on your own song? Thus far, each of the six singles released ahead of SR3MM has included a different order and arrangement of the credited artists, yet one fact remains the same: It’s the same two people on the mic. Attempting to clear up the confusion (or just continue the trolling, it’s hard to tell at this point), Swae Lee tweeted a video of himself using a whiteboard demonstration to explain the rationale behind the duo’s various listings, yet failed to accomplish much of anything (or successfully continued the trolling; again, it’s hard to tell). It’s simply the latest sign that we let artists get away with doing too much in the name of their own art; at least the songs have lived up to towering expectations so far.
Why I’m hopeful for the future: Inaugural WakandaCon comes to Chicago this summer
Wakanda forever, truly. In the style of the popular Comic-Con, a Black Panther-inspired WakandaCon will take place this summer in Chicago, honoring “Afro-futurism, Tech, and Black superheroes” over the course of three days, according to the convention’s website. In my 18 years of living in San Diego, I never made it to the Comic-Con that took over our downtown each summer, but there’s a much better chance I’d fly out to Chicago to continue the Black Panther experience in the best way possible.

Camila Cabello embarked on her first solo headlining tour, “Never Be the Same Tour,” on April 9. Tomás Mier | Daily Trojan

Nearly a year and a half ago, girl group Fifth Harmony announced in a tweet that Camila Cabello would be leaving to pursue a solo career. Harmonizers, as the group’s fanbase is dubbed, were left teary-eyed and unsure of what was in store for Cabello and 5H’s remaining members.
Now, Fifth Harmony is on hiatus after an unsuccessful album, while Cabello has shaken the charts with her hit song “Havana” and has embarked on her first headlining tour as a solo artist. 
Cabello hit the stage Saturday for the first of two nights in Los Angeles at the Hollywood Palladium, a venue too small to comfortably accommodate the thousands of Camilizers who packed the room like sardines. 
Expectations for her tour were high after she spent weeks promoting it on late night talk shows and performing her best-known solo songs, “Never Be The Same” and “Havana” at international music festivals.
Despite this, Cabello’s performance fell flat in L.A. 
Her stage presence was notably hindered by the size of the venue as a horde of dancers rushed onto a stage already too small for Cabello and her four-person band. At times, Cabello was lost among the sea of dancers, many of whom appeared too old to be touring with a young pop singer. 
After spending four years performing to upbeat songs flanked by four well-coordinated women, Cabello seemed out of place on stage next to dancers who performed somewhat too aggressively for her musical style.
After each song during the first half of her set, pre-recorded videos of Cabello looking at herself in the mirror, eating on a bed and throwing pillows at the camera played in the background. Her voice in the videos, muffled by the shrieking teens in the audience, told her audience that “everyone has a story.” 
Instead of enhancing her performance, the videos interrupted the concert’s flow. Her dark, lingerie-esque attire also did not fit the occasion as she performed songs like “Inside Out” and invited her young audience and the smattering of parents in attendance to sing along.
Cabello performed a stripped cover of Elvis Presley’s “Can’t Help Falling in Love.” The song felt out of place and abrupt, especially performed in front of a sea of teenagers whose music tastes are far more contemporary.
Cabello reframed her song “Something’s Gotta Give,” which many fans thought was about her departure from Fifth Harmony, to refer to gun violence in the country. As she sang lyrics like “If it doesn’t hurt me, why do I still cry?/If it didn’t kill me, then I’m half alive,” images from the March for Our Lives movement materialized on screen. The increased bass levels and Cabello’s emotional singing evoked a sense of urgency as her fans belted out the lyrics and some wiped away tears.
The first half of Cabello’s lackluster performance was redeemed by the second half, which featured two of the best songs on her self-titled debut record: “In The Dark” and “Into It.” With fewer dancers involved in the performance, Cabello focused on singing and engaging with the audience, setting these two songs apart from previous tracks which were plagued by excessive choreography. 
Cabello left the stage and returned for an encore after Camilizers chanted “CAMILA! CAMILA!” to bring her back. She performed an unreleased song titled “Sangria Wine,” which stood out as one of her best of the night. The pop beats and Spanish lyrics paired with Latino-inspired dance moves made for a worthy second-to-last song before she concluded the show with a bang with global hit “Havana.” 
While Cabello’s album proved to be a surprisingly successful comeback after leaving Fifth Harmony, her solo performing still needs improvement. Cabello still has not solidified her style or identity — her album cover saw her in a flowery dress, but her tour took on a darker portrayal. Only when  Cabello finds a middle-ground between being a chart-topping performer and a moody lyricist can she fully prove herself as a force to be reckoned with.

The USC men’s volleyball team pulled off a stunning upset over No. 5 Pepperdine in Malibu Saturday night in its Mountain Pacific Sports Federation quarterfinal playoff game.

Coming into the game, No. 6 seeded USC had dropped two straight games against Concordia and Grand Canyon University, while No. 3 seeded Pepperdine had won five of their last six, including wins over Concordia and GCU. 
With a 15-8 overall record (8-4 conference) compared to the Trojan’s 8-19 (3-7 conference), Pepperdine was a heavy favorite, and for good reason. Pepperdine proved its ability to consistently defeat top-ranked teams with a balance of smart coaching, strong attacking and fundamental defense throughout the year, leading to their top-five national ranking by the season’s end. 
Conversely, USC’s inexperienced yet talented roster had many ups and downs throughout the year, often hanging tight with top schools before narrowly falling by a few points each set.
“They’ve got some guys that absolutely bomb,” head coach Jeff Nygaard said before the Pepperdine matchup. “They’re in their gym so it’s a little bit of a home court advantage. When it gets to this level, I don’t ever anticipate that we’re going to stop people or shut people down, but our job is to mitigate them, to the level to where it gives us opportunities to win by one or two points.”
USC knew it had the ability to beat any team in the country, after their huge upset over No. 2 ranked UCLA on Senior Night. 
“Going to the playoffs, there’s all this other energy that’s out there, there’s all these other expectations,” said Nygaard. “When you saw what we did during UCLA, it was all of a sudden like, that was what the team should be playing to, so that’s what we’re trying to reproduce on a daily basis. That type of poise, composure, yet execution and high level of commitment to doing everything.” 
Pepperdine came out sluggish, perhaps underestimating their opponent, and USC capitalized by taking the first set 25-22. Pepperdine appeared to turn the tide in the second set with a strong 25-19 win, yet USC regrouped and pulled out the crucial third set, 26-24. With all the momentum on their side, the Trojans finished the match off convincingly with a 25-18 victory. 
Junior outside hitter Jack Wyett led USC with 20 kills, one ace and two blocks. His fellow junior outside hitter Gianluca Grasso was right behind with 19 kills, two aces and three blocks. Freshman middle blocker Sam Lewis showed great poise in his first playoff match, finishing with six kills and seven blocks, while junior outside hitter Ryan Moss contributed with nine kills and 10 digs. 
Most impressively, USC outhit Pepperdine .387 to .267, had 50 digs to 35 from Pepperdine and had eight blocks compared to the Waves’ six. 
USC now prepares to take on No. 4 BYU, the top overall seed in the playoffs. With the team seemingly peaking at the right time, it will be fun to see if the Trojans can continue their Cinderella run come April 19.

On its quest to snap a three-match losing streak, the beach volleyball team traveled to Seattle over the weekend to compete in the Pac-12 North Invitational. There, the Trojans finished 3-1, only losing to Cal on Sunday.

The weekend started smoothly for the Women of Troy as they faced the unranked Washington Huskies (10-11). Although Washington played hard to keep up with USC — forcing three-set decisions on two of the courts — USC was able to pull away for a 4-1 dual win. 
Despite how the outcome was already decided with wins on three courts, the Huskies fought valiantly on the first and second courts. Going up against the Trojans’ most consistent duo of junior Abril Bustamante and freshman Tina Graudina, Washington’s Jordan Anderson and Kimmy Gardner came out as the aggressors, winning the first set 20-22. Despite falling behind early, Graudina and Bustamante were able to fight back, win the second set 21-14 and put Anderson and Gardner away in the third set 15-9. Washington’s only point of the dual came on the second court in a three set showdown where sophomores Joy Dennis and Cammie Dorn were eventually bested by Destiny Julye and Courtney Schwan. 
Not long after their victory, USC ran into adversity when facing No. 14 Stanford (16-10). Initially, it looked as if the match would be a repeat of the blowout that occurred on March 25 where the Trojans swept the Cardinal 5-0, but the Trojans were able to pull together a win against the NorCal team. 
USC took the first points of the match behind the continued excellence of their most consistent pairs. Bustamante and Graudina defeated Morgan Hentz and Amelia Smith while Cannon and Slater took down Kate Formico and Catherine Raquel. 
Stanford would then punch back behind Courtney Bowen and Sunny Villapando, defeating Dennis and Dorn. Stanford’s Shannon Richardson and Blake Sharp also took down USC seniors Jenna Belton and Jo Kremer. 
In the end, it was a showdown between the fourth court pairings of USC’s Poletto and Hallgren taking on Stanford’s Payton Chang and Caitlin Keefe to decide the dual. Poletto and Hallgren would have to fight back from losing the first set 19-21 before winning the second set 21-14 and eventually taking the third 15-11 to sneak the win for the Trojans.
Despite avoiding an upset the day before, USC was stunned by the No. 13 California Bears (19-6) Sunday morning. Just as they did against Stanford, the Trojans came out firing on courts one and three with Bustamante and Graudina winning their individual match-up easily and Cannon and Slater also taking care of business. However, that would be the last of the good news for USC. 
The typically reliable senior pairing of Kremer and Belton was unable to hold off Grace Campbell and Maddie Micheletti. On court two, the struggling duo of Dennis and Dorn lost to the Cardinal’s Jessica Gaffney and Iya Lindahl. With the dual knotted up at 2-2, it was once again up to Poletto and Hallgren to decide the Trojans’ fate. In an even, three-set thriller where both sides played exceptionally well, it would be Cal’s Mia Merino and Caroline Schafer coming out on top in the third set 15-13 to complete the upset. California became just the seventh team ever to beat USC in a dual. 
Despite the disappointing outcome against Cal, USC had to quickly turn around to take on the Oregon Ducks. The Ducks (2-10), who had only played nine duals all season before going against the Trojans, showed they have a ways to go before they can compete with beach volleyball elite. 
USC swept Oregon across the board starting court five with Belton and Kaiser jumping all over Marine Hall-Poirier and Kyra Hanawahine 21-7 and 21-9. Soon thereafter, Graudina and Bustamante shut down Lindsey Vander Weide and August Raskie. Meanwhile, Cannon and Slater, along with Poletto and Hallgren,  won on the third and fourth courts. The most encouraging sign from this matchup was on court two where Dennis and Dorn picked up their first and only win of the weekend with a win over Taylor Agost and Josie Cole.
Up next for USC (20-10) is a double-header at home Tuesday against Grand Canyon and Long Beach State.

Sam Arslanian | Daily Trojan
The Los Angeles Angels are off to their best start since 1979. Touting a 13-3 record in their first 16 games, the team has made a complete 180 compared to their previous two seasons, where the Angels finished 21 games behind the league leader in both 2017 and 2016. I’ve thought a lot about what the special sauce has been for the team in their recipe for success this year. In evaluating their success, there is no way to avoid talking about Halo’s two stars. 
First and foremost, there is Mike Trout. He has simply been a beast so far, not that he wasn’t a beast before. Trout is the most well-rounded baseball player in the MLB. There is no question about that; he is the definition of the term “five tool.” His batting average (.266) may not completely reflect that right now, but he leads the Angels in homers, RBIs and on-base percentage. 
But no one man makes a team, and for the first time in a couple years the Angels look like they have that figured out. The Angels hold the best team batting average in the MLB, and are in first place in runs — with the next team nearly 20 runs behind — and they have the third-best fielding percentage. The only team that could hold a candle to the Halos is the Boston Red Sox; hopefully, we will see that matchup in October.
In addition to Trout, the Angels have another exciting, yet unconventional star in Shohei Ohtani. It is unprecedented to see a player like him. Madison Bumgarner is the only pitcher that I can think of who drew headlines for hitting performances. The difference is that MadBum hit well for a pitcher, while Ohtani stacks up with the league’s best bats on any given day. Oh, and of course, he’s a solid pitcher.
Robert Whiting, the author of several books on Japanese baseball, noted that Ohtani will find success in the MLB because of his unique traits.
“It’s hard to top a guy who wins two games and hits three home runs in a week,” Whiting told ESPN. “He is very affable and could well have a long career in American baseball — but most likely as a pitcher.”
I do, however, think some of the “Sho-hype” is a bit premature — he’s been in the league for 15 games. There is no reason his signed rookie card should be selling for nearly seven grand at this point. 
Perhaps, there is another way to look at how Ohtani has benefited the Angels. At 23 years old and coming from the Japanese league, Sho undoubtedly breaks the norm of the Angels — a relatively older team. The level of excitement and freshness Ohtani brings must give the team some sort of spark that has lifted the Angels to such a fantastic start. 
In recent years, streaky seasons have haunted the Angels. At this point we are only about 10 percent of the way through the 162-game season, so the Angels need to beware of losing skids and injuries. Those unfortunate events are bound to happen — it’s a long season — but the Angels’ success will be defined by how they evade and recover from these downfalls.
It’s entirely possible for the Angels to make a run deep into October. It’s a peculiar trend in baseball, because star teams don’t necessarily guarantee rings in Major League Baseball. But the 2018 Angels aren’t the Golden State Warriors nor the 2015 Detroit Tigers. The wealth of talent is different; it’s new, fresh and diverse. Any team that can mix the success of young and old, hitting and pitching and fast and slow will find success in the MLB.
