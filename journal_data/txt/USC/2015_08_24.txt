Thousands of Angelenos and USC students spent this weekend at FYF Festival in nearby Exposition Park. What was expected to be an enjoyable yet understated indie rock affair proved to be a well-run festival that appears to be on the brink of exploding in popularity over the next couple of years.
This is FYF’s second year in Exposition Park. Though last year there were complaints over a crowded venue and plagued with the long lines that are standard for many music festivals, this year’s festival was much more organized. The five stages were well-marked and divided by genre. For example, the Trees Stage had the more relaxing acts — perfect for Mac Demarco or Tobias Jesso Jr. — and the Woods Stage showcased the more punchy acts like Savages and Death Grips, the Arena had most of the DJ and electronic sets such as Flying Lotus and BADBADNOTGOOD, and the Main Stage was well equipped with crowd pleasers including Flume and Kanye West. Once it was established which genre of music was at which stage, navigating between them felt very natural. One thing that was problematic was that the Lawn Stage, which was located right at the entrance of the festival, was a good distance from the other stages at the festival. But at the same time, it was nice to hear live music immediately after entering the gates.
The quality of the lineup was the main attraction of FYF, and it did not disappoint. Sampling all of the stages turned out to be an interesting activity, especially considering talented musicians were located everywhere. The distance between some of the stages, however, usually led to either leaving most sets 10 minutes early or arriving at other sets 10 minutes late if there was an act at another stage. To navigate around that, the most effective way to get the most out of the festival was to stay at a particular venue to get closer to the most coveted acts. For example, just staying at the Main Stage for about an hour helped with getting to the front row for Kanye West. Though there were other acts in between different stages, being really close to the front for two to three acts made for a better experience than being near the back or middle for four to five acts.
The weekend had the feel of a watershed year for FYF Fest. The lineup that was brought in this year far exceeded the lineups the festival had brought in the past, and acts like Kanye West, Flume and others have increased the word-of-mouth of the festival more than ever before. From here, it will be interesting to see how the festival grows in the future. Whether or not Exposition Park will be the venue of the future for FYF is questionable as the festival hasn’t been known to stay in the same place for too long. For now, USC students are encouraged to take advantage of the event while its close to home.

Wearing a cardinal and gold jersey carries a rich tradition of football greatness in a program unparalleled by any other. With the prestige of a USC education, the unique qualities that Los Angeles adds to a college experience and the powerhouse football program, it’s no wonder that football recruits put USC at the top of their list.
Year after year, USC appears in the top 10 in rankings of recruiting classes, and this year is no different. In his second year, recruiting coordinator and linebacker coach Peter Sirmon has rounded up a successful recruiting class to carry the torch for the upcoming season. Many media outlets have USC’s incoming class among the top three in the nation: No. 1 by rivals.com, No. 2 by 247sports.com and No. 3 by ESPN.com. Coming into a historic program of champions, the new recruits know they have big shoes to fill.
“We didn’t come here to be mediocre, we didn’t come here [to] be OK. We came here to win championships,” head coach Steve Sarkisian told recruits at PAC-12 media day. “If the expectations were going to be too big, this wasn’t the place for you.”
The spring enrollees got a head start on navigating college and are flourishing. WR Isaac Whitney (Southmoore HS/Oklahoma City, Oklahoma/Riverside CC) provides depth as he joins in the rotation at the wideout position.  LB Cameron Smith (Granite Bay HS/Roseville, California), OL Roy Hemsley (Windward School/Los Angeles, California), and OL Chuma Edoga (McEachern HS/Powder Springs, Georgia).
As the Trojans enter the fall season, they add another 19 members from California, Nevada, Utah and Texas.
New QB Sam Darnold (San Clemente HS/Capistrano Beach, California) is an exceptional athlete and joins a growing roster of potential replacements for Kessler once he leaves USC.
“Behind [Kessler], we have quality depth,” Sarkisian said leading into spring practice.  “There will be a tremendous battle for the backup role and the future starting job,”
Joining the team in hopes of supplementing Sarkisian’s approach of playing an up-tempo, no-huddle offense are new faces OL Cole Smith (Mission Viejo HS/ Mission Viejo, California), WR De’Quan Hampton (Dominguez HS/Carson, California/Long Beach CC), TE Tyler Petite (Campolindo HS/Lafayette, California), WR Deontay Burnett (Junipero Serra/ Gardena, California), WR Deontay Burnett (Serra HS/ Gardena, California), and preferred walk-on TE Caleb Wilson (Serra HS/ Gardena, California). The Trojans are not short in the speed department with the addition of the rookies: TB-WR Dominic Davis (Bishop Alemany HS/Los Angeles, California), TB Ronald Jones II (McKinney North HS/McKinney, Texas), and TB Aca’Cedric Ware (Cedar Hill HS/DeSoto, Texas).
Playing on both sides of the ball has worked for veteran Trojans, including Adoree’ Jackson. Three freshmen looking to make a similar impact for the 2015 season are DB-WR Isaiah Langley (Foothill HS/Hayward, California), DB-WR Ykili Ross (Riverside Poly HS/Riverside, California) and LB-TE Osa Masina (Brighton HS/Salt Lake City, Utah).
A big loss came early with the Trojans following the 2014 season with losing standout two-time-All-American defensive end and sixth overall NFL draft pick Leonard Williams. Incoming freshmen DL Jacob Daniel (North HS/Fresno, California), DL Rasheem Green (Serra HS/Los Angeles, California), DL Noah Jefferson (Liberty HS/Las Vegas, Nevada), DL Christian Rector (Loyola HS/South Pasadena, California) and DL Kevin Scott  (Salesian HS/Duarte, California) hope to fill the slot that Williams left behind.
Sarkisian knows that the loss of Williams will be detrimental, but he said he is not worried about the upcoming depth of this position.
“There is lots of senior leadership, while at the same time the new players will be hungry to push for playing time,” he said.
After losing Senior captain Hayes Pullard to the NFL draft and graduation, USC comes up big with the addition of two tough linebackers, LB John Houston Jr. (Serra HS/ Carson, California) and LB Porter Gustin (Salem Hills HS/Elk Ridge, Utah). Junior SOLB Su’a Cravens stated during PAC-12 media day that he’s following in the footsteps of some of his former teammates and mentors and is “taking on a leadership role that’s not focusing on just [his] game, but also on those around [him], especially the young guys.” In the 2015 season, the Sam, Mike and Will positions are stacked more than ever under the leadership of Sirmon and veterans Anthony Sarao, Lamar Dawson and Scott Felix.
Defensively, USC is rebuilding from losing key players, but Sarkisian knows that his guys have what it takes.
“We have signed tremendous recruiting classes here that have added depth to our roster,” Sarkisian said. “We expect to be a better team in the fourth quarter this year and finish games stronger.”

Not only does USC’s women’s soccer franchise have a solid selection of talent -— old and new — to fill out this season’s roster, but the team is also growing stronger as a unit on the field each day.
“This team couldn’t be more different than the teams of the past,” junior defender Dominique Randle said.
Randle said the team’s biggest improvement since her Trojan start three years ago is confidence.
“I see our team improving on our movement off the ball and reading each other better,” Randle said. “I think over the past year, we all really connected and understand how everyone plays.”
The addition of transfer players Sydney Myers, from Santa Clara, and Amanda Rooney, from North Carolina, are also proving to be a big asset to this collective mindset in the current preseason.
“Now, we added a few players and developed a style of play that complements the type of players we are,” Randle said. “We are trusting ourselves and our abilities more than we have in the past.”
As far as this season goes, though, everyone has something to contribute to the journey.
“We have built such a strong team dynamic that every player has an influential role on the team,” Randle said. “Compared to other teams in the conference, I think we pride ourselves in making sure every last player can play any position. Being interchangeable is what makes our team so unpredictable and dangerous.”
Randle, the No. 5 defender, is among the pack of influential Trojans on the field this season. After being redshirted freshman year from an injury, she came around in 2014 to make big contributions for the Women of Troy. Randle finished the season with four shots and 20 starts out of 21 games played.
“She’s got a unique story having to fight through the injury for the first part of her career and last year finally making it through a season and not just making it through, becoming one of our best defenders,” head coach Keidane McAlpine said. “Randle’s season turnaround from redshirt to defensive asset highlights her mental fortitude and her determination to succeed.
Randle’s defensive contributions this seasons are among the advantages that could push USC through challenging conference play, but also importantly, give the women a chance at redemption in this year’s NCAA Women’s Championship. The Women of Troy left in the first round last championship after losing to Pepperdine 4-2 in shootouts.
As a collective season, USC finished fourth in the Pac-12 with a 6-5 record, just behind Colorado (6-4).  UCLA finished at the top of the conference with 10-0 and Stanford (9-1) took second.
Nonetheless, last year’s shortcomings seem to have created a goal-oriented outlook for the coming season, where Randle can expect to lead.
“She’s going to be huge for us,” McAlpine said. “Our team last year I think cut 10 goals off the record season total from the year before, and that was one of our goals going into the year. I think the mindset now is to shave more goals off the season, to put us in a better position longterm.”
Thinking more about the team as a unit, Randle also sees goal-fulfilling potential.
“This preseason, we haven’t forgot what we learned so now it is taking what we did last year and integrating the new players,” Randle said. “So far, they are doing better than expected. At the rate we are going, we should be ready for any competition and we should exceed the goals we have set for ourselves.”
According to Randle, the Trojan’s motto this season is, “One Moment, One Now”.
Living up to the motto, Randle says that she and her teammates plan on taking each of their battles on the field one game at a time, regardless of whether they carry conference championship implications.
“Conference games are always a battle, we always want to finish in at least the top three. However, we must prepare for each game individually,” Randle said.
The Women of Troy split their opening weekend, beating Texas Tech but falling to Florida State on a late goal. Their next game is at UC Riverside on Aug. 28.

The dawn of the 2015 college football season is fast approaching. And with it, multitudes of media outlets have begun to release various polls predicting different outcomes for the season. But despite the variety, USC seems to be a trending pick this preseason. ESPN’s preseason All-American team selections were recently released, and the Trojans are well-represented.
Senior center Max Tuerk seems to be the most undisputed choice for best center in the nation. He is a captain this season and one of the most versatile offensive linemen in college football, able to play both tackle and guard. This year, he’ll lead an experienced offense alongside fellow senior and veteran quarterback Cody Kessler.
Junior linebacker Su’a Cravens also represents USC on the preseason team. Cravens is easily one of the most dynamic and versatile players on the field. As a sophomore, Cravens had a team-high 17 tackles for losses — the most of any defensive back in the nation — with five recorded as sacks. Cravens also had a team-high of three picks in 2014. His speed also allows him to return those interceptions for touchdowns.
Adoree’ Jackson represents the Trojans as ESPN’s choice on special teams. USC lists him as a cornerback, wide receiver and kick returner because it appears there isn’t anything he can’t do. Jackson punctuated his remarkable 2014 season with a front flip into the end zone for a touchdown in the Holiday Bowl. He is not only an All-American contender but has a legitimate chance at being the first defensive back to win the Heisman in years.
Tuerk, Cravens and Jackson were also named to ESPN’s preseason All-Pac-12 team, as was Kessler.
Kessler opted to return for his senior season at USC and finds himself in a conference that seems to be wide open. His biggest Pac-12 threats in 2014 were Oregon and UCLA, both of which lost their quarterbacks to the NFL. Possibly Kessler’s biggest competition at quarterback is Cal’s Jared Goff. But, Kessler’s experience as a redshirt senior gives him an edge over Goff, who is just a junior.
Missing from both lists is sophomore wide receiver JuJu Smith-Schuster. He managed to have a breakout freshman campaign while still being only the No. 2 receiver behind Nelson Agholor. Smith-Schuster still has a long way to go to make the All-American team, but I think he at least deserves honorable mention on the All-Pac-12 team.
As Matt Barkley and the Trojans learned in 2012, preseason hype means nothing if you can’t come through during the season. Though it is nice to see USC garnering recognition as a top competitor this year, the Trojans still have a lot to prove on the field.
Unfortunately, the Trojans are beginning the season in the wake of scandal yet again as tight end Bryce Dixon was dismissed from the team last week, and more recently, Coach Sarkisian’s “inappropriate behavior” at Salute to Troy landed him in hot water. It is important that neither the hype nor the controversy have any place in the locker room.
Under the arm and wing of a veteran quarterback, the Trojans have all the necessary talent and skill to compete for a national title. The only thing left to do is put the pieces together.

The USC football team opened up at No. 8 in the first edition of the Associated Press Top 25 poll that was released on Sunday.
This is the highest the Trojans have been ranked since 2012, when they were ranked No. 1 and went on to finish the season unranked. That was the first time a No. 1 ranked team finished unranked since Ole Miss in 1964.
UCLA is ranked at No. 13 in the preseason polls, placing the Bruins close behind the Trojans. Both Pac-12 schools were ranked higher in the AP poll than in the preseason coaches’ poll.
USC was tabbed to win the Pac-12 Championship over the Ducks in a preseason media poll last month.
With veteran quarterback Cody Kessler returning to the Trojans for his third season, expectations are high for the team. Now that the NCAA scholarship sanction is a thing of the past, the Trojans are recruiting as well as any other school in the country, finishing with one of the nation’s top-ranked recruiting classes. The play on the field this year should surely reflect that.
In spite of the tremendous talent on the team, the Trojans now have a lot to prove. New players, offseason hype and high preseason rankings increase the pressure for the team.
The team or certain players must step up and replace star wide receiver Nelson Agholor, lineman Leonard Williams and tailback Javorius Allen.
Six total Pac-12 teams made the rankings, making the Pac-12 the second highest conference after the SEC with eight teams. The Pac-12 is arguably one of the deepest conferences in the nation, making the Trojan’s climb to the top that much more difficult.

College feels like a New York minute. Yes, even when you go to school in Los Angeles.
This week I’m embarking on the beginning of my senior year. I’ve attended three rounds of football seasons, rocked out at a plethora of free on-campus concerts, heard our fight song way too many times (just kidding, you can’t hear it too many times) and frequented every fast food place along Figueroa Street. I still have nine more months until I move my tassel to the left and go from a “student” to “alum.” Yet I feel like I need way more time.
These feelings started popping up this summer after I finished my junior year classes. Around the same time, another milestone happened. Millennials — defined as people born between 1982 to 2000 — finally outnumbered the baby boomers in this country, according to the U.S. Census Bureau. We now make up a quarter of the U.S. population.
Millennials sometimes get a bad rep. We’ve been called the “selfie” generation and been told we’re tied to technology. Meanwhile, we push back and constantly say that our tendencies and connection to social media is more necessary than ever. So with this newly minted title of “largest group in the country,” one question that arises is, “Where do we go from here?”
These two anxieties of being a graduating senior and member of the millennial generation really amplified when I saw the progress on the Village at USC. It’s absolutely beautiful and man, do I wish I had a chance to live and shop there as an undergraduate. But I’ll be in the real world by then.
And now I wish I had more time to work at Daily Trojan.
And I wish I had more time to try out a club I was too afraid to join.
And I wish I had more time to meet more people.
I simply wish I had more time.
In the course of four years at USC, it seems like one can almost radiate cardinal and gold. Not in the school spirit way where you must attend every single Trojan football game ever, but in the way that your goals become married to your syllabus. All USC students are good students. We know what we have to accomplish to get that “A” or which leadership positions we have to take on to get to the next level.
Yet the start of senior year does something weird to the millennial psyche. Despite being hyper-involved in clubs and organizations, piling up internship credentials and spending one too many all-nighters in (Club) Leavey Library, when we’re forced to accept the world outside of the University Park Campus, it can feel like we’re starting from zero.
Have I done enough? Or worse, have I done anything at all? The stated mission of USC is to develop students “through the cultivation and enrichment of the human mind and spirit.” But have we taken full advantage of that while on our race to the top?
Though USC can sometimes be an isolated place, I’m not alone in these feelings. More than 3,000 other students in the University of Southern California’s Class of 2016 are at the same point of their lives. On an even grander scale, there’s millions of 20-somethings heading into their last years in college, trying to firmly situate themselves on a path that leads to 1) a decent paying job and 2) happiness.
That’s not too much to ask for, right? We have goals. We are working hard to execute them. But rounding the edge of the safety net of college is jarring. It can sometimes make you feel like you “just can’t even.”
So like any true millennial I have set out goals for this column. Throughout the semester it will be used as a springboard for conversations among us millennials. With each column I hope it moves us closer to understanding what it means to be a millennial, having politicians pander to us and how we can successfully move out of the USC world we have grown to master. It’s for all the millennials out there feeling anxious and simultaneously hopeful.
After we leave the USC bubble that hovers over Jefferson, Exposition and Vermont, we’ll be in a whole new playing field. We’ll have new assessments, new challenges and no syllabi. But we’ll still have goals.
The start of senior year — heck, the start of any school year — is a time for new goals. We’re going to somehow navigate this “real world” that people keep talking about. But hopefully this column begins to address some of those fears. And in some crazy way, helps tackle them.
After reading “Wait an L.A. Minute” on Tuesdays, join Jordyn Holman in her millennial conversations on Twitter @JordynJournals. She’s a senior studying print and digital journalism.

In an effort to revamp sex education, Los Angeles Unified School District announced last month that “sexting” will be added to school curriculum. LAUSD will roll out a thoughtfully designed initiative that includes videos, lesson plans and handouts for students. By informing students about the risks and consequences of sexting, the program will effectively illuminate the possible repercussions of sexting, bringing a much-needed update to sex education curriculum.
As technology has increased access to every aspect of people’s lives — even the most private elements — the constant sharing of personal information, combined with the permanent nature of materials sent into cyberspace, can spell out detrimental consequences for sexters. According to the Department of Psychology at the University of Utah, of those who received a sext, 25 percent sent it to someone else. Stemming from the trophy syndrome, which makes the receiver of a sext highly likely to share it with friends, such resharing can lead to revenge porn — the sharing of sexually explicit photos without the consent of the owner. If shared across social networks, sending sexually explicit photos could result in loss of control of the original interaction, the destruction of the sender’s reputation and future humiliation and retaliation. Educating youth about the potential consequences of sexting can greatly decrease the chances of extortion and bullying.
Some LAUSD parents might echo the same concern with sext education as they harbor with comprehensive sex education: Teaching sexting could encourage the practice. However, ignoring the reality of sexting leaves teenagers unprepared for modern sexual interactions. It is far preferable for teenagers to learn about how to avoid extortion and sext safely than to sext without fully understanding the consequences.
As LAUSD brings sex education to the 21st century, many other sex education curricula are stuck far, far in the past. According to the Guttmacher Institute, only 22 states mandate that sex education be taught at all, and 37 states mandate that abstinence be incorporated in sex education when taught. As the second largest school district in the United States, LAUSD plays a pivotal role in the behavior of other school districts. If implemented correctly, the district could influence the curriculums of other schools, working to update sex education nationwide.
Whether educators recognize it or not, sexting is a large part of modern sexual interactions. In an age in which most sex education is far too archaic to be a realistic source of information, LAUSD is stepping it up, and other school districts need to as well.

The release of a trailer for the horror film Del Playa early this month has outraged thousands who consider it outrightly disrespectful of the May 2014 killings that took place in Isla Vista, California. The film mirrors the shooting at the University of California, Santa Barbara, inadvertently fictionalizing the incident. A petition on Change.org calls for solidarity among the film’s opponents to stop its release in theaters worldwide. The petition has gained about 28,000 supporters, all of whom seek “to educate the filmmakers about the seriousness behind gun violence tragedies and “to halt the release of the insensitive and untimely Del Playa film.” By successfully sensationalizing tragedy into cheap entertainment, Del Playa outrightly disrespects and diminishes the Isla Vista killings, justifying the petition’s purpose.
The movie depicts a distraught college student-turned-killer who has faced rejection from women and isolation from male peers. In Isla Vista, the street where Del Playa takes place, Santa Barbara City College student Elliot Rodger killed six people and injured 14 others before taking his own life. According to his many YouTube videos, in which he pledges “to take to the streets of Isla Vista” and “slay every single person” he sees, Rodger was resentful of his inability to interact with the opposite sex. The similarities between the two narratives of a love-scorned psychopath are more than an act of cinematic allusion.
Film producer Josh Berger maintains that though “there is the connection of Santa Barbara, this film is not about Elliot Rodger. The fictional character in the film is not meant to portray anyone in particular.” But even the title Del Playa, a reference to a street in Isla Vista, associates too strongly with the beaches of Santa Barbara. To suggest that audiences will not associate this film with the Isla Vista incident is reductive. Regardless of the film’s accuracy in portraying Elliot Rodger and his victims, the film appropriates the Isla Vista shooting at the expense of survivors.
The film’s content is arguably its greatest detriment. By trivializing the Isla Vista shooting, Del Playa turns shooter and student Elliot Rodger into an archetype of a pariah and college student who is rejected by sorority girls. In doing so, the film glorifies the actions of the killer while delegitimizing the trauma felt by survivors.
Audiences might perceive the antagonist to be Rodger, as the studio intends. This characterization rewrites the story, glorifying the killer as a man of power and as a star of huge Hollywood blockbuster. As opposed to leaving his name to die in the past, the film will immortalize him in cinema history at the expense of the UCSB community.
When a film has emotionally disturbing content and chooses to dramaticize violence instead of condemn it, it intentionally desensitizes the viewer in the process. Such desensitization can make viewers less empathetic towards real suffering.
Less than a year and a half after the Isla Vista shooting, the release of this film is, above all else, untimely and in poor taste, making a commodity out of lives lost and a mockery out of the lives stuck in mourning.
Correction: An earlier version of this article stated Elliot Rodger attended UCSB. Rodger attended Santa Barbara City College. The Daily Trojan regrets the error.
Being from Isla Vista and, having been there the night of, I agree about as completely as I can with this article. Dislike the petition against this film and the Berger Bros all you want, if you didn’t see the blood on the streets outside your friends’ houses then I don’t really give a fuck about your opinion, the fact is you’re wrong, and anyone from UCSB will agree to that.
The politically correct ninnies are at it again.

For American households, the college experience means an investment, a mark of wealth and a time for growth. Its importance is rarely understated; degrees go hand in hand with higher incomes for graduates and open up unparalleled professional opportunities.
The White House announced plans earlier this month to open funding for college-level education for prison inmates, a group often overlooked in discussions about educational equity. The investment, rare in a system struggling to accommodate surging inmate populations, may provide critical resources toward educational and job opportunities. Four California state prisons plan to launch community programs this fall for inmate education. The Obama administration has already begun to open up inmate access to Pell Grants. Recent plans paint an optimistic view of education reform, yet they do not resolve root causes for California’s intrinsic educational inequality.
Considering that government action has traditionally neglected education for prisoners, the move provides a refreshing shift in policy. Prison inmates have been historically banned from qualifying for student aid, and affording classes when released is often difficult, especially because felons have increasingly limited educational and professional options. Compound the lack of resources with impoverished backgrounds that prisoners may come from, and they have little means with which to further their education.
While education is an integral piece of economic access and job opportunity, federal plans for student aid fail to provide the comprehensive institutional reform that California’s prison system needs. Education Secretary Tim Duncan sells the plan as a solution to prison overcrowding that pushes inmates “back on track” and thus reduces recidivism, but the plan does not address overcrowding — the root of educational inequality for prisoners who face obstacles to education while in prison and after being released. To impact overcrowding, lawmakers cannot simply introduce educational access within prisons; they must address greater issues with incarceration.
California’s notoriously stressed prison system has never been a surprise; with a 137.5 percent occupational capacity (a reduction from its previous 144 percent in 2014), it faces problems ranging from lack of medical equipment to the absence of psychiatrists. California may have released thousands of prisoners in a move to deal with overcrowding, but conditions remain dire. National incarceration rates remain the highest in the world, beating out countries such as China, Russia and Saudi Arabia.
Federal solutions to better educational access are a Band-Aid solution to deeper problems in prison. Tough laws such as the “three strikes” provision, originally mandating three-time serious felony offenders a minimum sentence of 25 years to life, stuff an already bloated system and provide little real help.
The upholding of  tough-on-drugs policies from the 1980s continues to contribute to massive rates of imprisonment in California. Aggressive criminalization rates in the state have hurt men of color, a group faced with disproportionately higher sentences for drug offenses despite comparable drug use by racial groups across the board. Considering this community already faces discrimination when pursuing professional and educational opportunities, the increasing incarceration of men of color further inhibits their ability to pursue higher education. Opening up grants for students in prison and conducting undergraduate courses will improve conditions within prisons, but it will not resolve structural policy situations that create stressed prison systems in the first place.
Understandably, lawmakers face difficulty cutting prison populations and focusing on community empowerment. At an hourly rate of $1 – 3 a day, prisoners are a massive source of cheap labor. On the surface, “job training” develops on-site skills and saves millions but comes at an intrinsic conflict of interest with advocates in sentencing reduction and more rehabilitation service programs. Even now, lawyers for the state’s attorney general office use labor as an excuse to block sentence reduction programs for nonviolent inmates. Sold as economic empowerment, the convenience of free labor provides an obstacle to furthering the personal development of prisoners and incentivizes lawmakers to ignore the overcrowding that keeps citizens in jail instead of pursuing an education.
The Obama administration may be trying to improve conditions within prisons, but it must also question the “why” behind prison overcrowding  to effect larger, structural change. Improving educational programming can be incredibly powerful, both in its economic access and moral and political development. However, fixing prison conditions is no answer to resolving the policies that trap entire communities in the prison system and hinder opportunities to attend college. Recent progressions towards prison education only highlight the scope of what must be done to really improve prison conditions.

Though many would argue that the music festival season is coming to a close, Los Angeles’ FYF festival proved to be a strong contender in keeping the spirit of music mayhem alive. On Aug. 22 and 23, artists from every genre performed at the illustrious and close-to-home Memorial Sports Arena and Exposition Park. Entertaining hipsters and jazz-cats included billion-dollar headliners such as Kanye West.
D’Angelo and the Vanguard were a definite shining star of the festival. With his contemporary R&B soul-sound, D’Angelo brought to life his newest album released in 2014, Black Messiah. Despite his struggles in the past with developing and releasing music, D’Angelo has enhanced and beautifully constructed the soulful sound of his vision for a bright future in the music world.
Changing gears to the electronic scene, FYF offered a plethora of interesting and diverse electronic artists. Canadian-based group Purity Ring performed songs from their newest album Another Eternity, released in 2015. With their classic otherworldly sound, these artists brought energy and vibrance to the FYF stage.
Andrew Jackson Jihad brought an air of social change and controversy to their set at FYF this season. This Phoenix-based folk-punk band has often been criticized in the past for their subversive and socially critical lyrics about poverty and the human condition. Despite the “haters,” Andrew Jackson Jihad brought a kind of vitality to the festival that challenged the minds and hearts of many of the attendees.
One act that I think everyone needs to look into is Horse Meat Disco. Despite the provocative and ironic name, this British DJ collective is my new addiction. They specialize in disco-funky beats and 80’s themed hits. Not only is it perfect dance music, but it also speaks to the trend of revival. Horse Meat Disco is the kind of visionary work that defines the music industry, far beyond the stage of FYF.
On another note, Solange Knowles also performed at FYF. The self-indulgent, Motown-inspired singer and songwriter crooned tunes from her first two albums, Solo Star (2003) and Sol Angel and the Hadley St. Dreams (2008) in preparation for her much-discussed upcoming album. Though she has accumulated a significant following and is widely acclaimed by her fans, her attitude and self-indulgence could inhibit her from reaching and inspiring more fans. Her FYF performance was a hopeful exhibit of the potential of her future music career.
FYF’s medley of soul, electronic, folk and punk artists brought an electric energy to downtown Los Angeles this past weekend. If the vision seen at FYF is any indication of what this upcoming season will bring, I am positive there will be some amazing new music coming this way.

Studying abroad has been something I’ve eagerly awaited for an entire year now, and in the time leading up to it, I wanted to prepare as much as I could. In the end, no matter how many Lonely Planet books I read or Pinterest boards I perused, there was no way to quite fully grasp the concept of moving to a different country until it actually happened.
I realized this as I sat in San Francisco International Airport, both ecstatic and uncomfortably terrified.
Though I went through a hard time in deciding whether to study abroad in an English-speaking country, these past few days of living in London have still been an adjustment. Forget the simple mistakes of naively getting into the front seat of an Uber vehicle only to realize you’re sitting in the driver’s seat, or referring to the toilet as the “restroom” and getting weird glances. Moving into our new flat was a shock in itself.
With a room size comparable to a closet, my roommate and I pushed our two tiny single beds together to make a “mega-bed,” cramped yet cozy. The other thing to get used to was the noise. Though USC can sometimes be loud, the only things that kept me at night were the occasional sirens or drunken students stumbling home. Here, we live in an extremely busy area, and no matter what time of the day, the wall between the outside world and us can sometimes feel non-existent.

Even though we’re slowly starting to make our way around this city, everything is still very unfamiliar, and with classes already starting Monday, I think many of us don’t know how to feel. Speaking for myself, I have no problem admitting that one thing I do feel for certain is overwhelmed.
I spent this past summer working as an orientation advisor on campus. Every week, I witnessed hundreds of freshmen that nervously entered our campus, unsure of what was ahead. As an OA, I served as a sort of guide and mentor for these new students. I was a role of support and symbol of stability, someone who had USC all figured out.
After having been the “know-it-all” these past three months, it’s extremely odd being on the other side of things again. I forgot how terrifying it could be as the nervous incoming student, being the one who is lost and needs guidance. Only after arriving at my destination can I truly sympathize with all those hesitant freshean I welcomed with open and confident arms.
As I embark on this study abroad adventure, I can’t help but think of them as I browse through Facebook photos of convocation and big orange bins on move-in day. With classes starting this week, all I can say is I hope that freshmen realize that even the know-it-all’s go through the same transition process as they do, and that they’re truly not alone. In the end, no matter how nerve-wracking it might be, I am excited for the journeys ahead for both them and myself.

Ask my sister, parents, three-time roommate or anyone else who had the misfortune of going to a cafe with my picky palate, and they will confirm that I spent the first 18-and-a-half years of my life vehemently hating hot beverages. On Dec. 1, 2014, I made a life-changing decision that went against everything I had ever believed in. That decision was to start drinking coffee.
I’m not saying that the only reason I decided to dive into the world of overpriced dirt water was so I could pretend to be a pseudo-cool kid sippin’ on a cup of black coffee on the windowsill of a hyper-minimalist, monochromatic roastery while I nonchalantly pretend to ignore the Instagrammers include me in their next post… but… yeah, that’s the only reason I decided to dive into the world of overpriced dirt water. Whatevs. I have an aesthetic to maintain and I’m not even sorry.
But, now that that background has been covered, here’s the real deal:
I’m Jackie. I’m a gun-slingin’, yoga practicin’, rock climbin’, math studyin’ junior and I live and breathe espresso.
During the winter of 2014, I was somehow convinced to uproot my life and try a “real latte” (read: not a Java Chip Frappuccino) from a “real coffee shop” (read: not Starbucks) by a friend, and per her recommendation (read: by sheer force), I accompanied her (read: was dragged) to Intelligentsia Coffee and Tea in Silverlake. I kinda, sorta, really fell in love with the entire coffee culture and thus, Coffee Tour was born!
Since then, I’ve made it my mission to make up for the last 18.5 coffee-deprived years of my life by going to a new coffee shop whenever and wherever possible. I will review them all. Every. Single. One. As of today, I’ve hit 39 different locations with the intention to turn that into 50 by the time the semester starts on Aug. 24. Regardless of whether or not that goal is met, if you’re looking for a place to snag a great cup o’ joe with that Tinder boy you just matched, you can count on this coffee tour series to hook you up with a super solid drink that will make up for how bad that date will probably be.
If you know of any good places that you think I haven’t been to yet, let me know. I’m always looking for suggestions.
And with that, I formally invite and welcome you to #JackieLikesJava!
 
 
Great article, well – balanced wit and humor! Not a bit boring to read.
 I’m looking forward to the next one.
