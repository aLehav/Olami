“I am here today to endorse Gavin Newsom to be the next governor of the State of California,” Harris said in her speech. “Gavin and I have been friends for a long time, long before either of us were elected to political office … He has the courage to be a leader on universal health coverage. He has the courage to be a leader on smart gun safety policy. And he will bring that leadership as governor.”
Harris, who received an honorary degree from USC in 2015 when she was the California Attorney General, also came to USC in 2016 during her successful senatorial campaign.
Newsom spoke after Harris gave her endorsement.
“I couldn’t be more honored that [Harris] is with us,” Newsom said in his speech. “I have four kids … I want them to grow up to see powerful leaders of all stripes … At our best, we don’t tolerate diversity, we celebrate it.”
After the event, Newsom spoke to the press about the importance of Harris’ endorsement to his campaign.
“This was a very significant endorsement at a critical time, weeks before the [California Democratic State] Convention,” Newsom said. “Kamala Harris is literally universally acknowledged as one of the top rising star Democrats in the United States of America. She is a profoundly significant political figure, and for me at this important critical juncture in this campaign, to have her endorse me is a very important milestone.”
Accompanying Harris and Newsom was Denea Joseph, a Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals recipient who emigrated from Belize at the age of 7 and was raised in South Los Angeles. Joseph was Harris’ guest at the 2018 State of the Union address.
“I’ve been extremely privileged to call California home,” Joseph said. “California is at the forefront of advocating for all … because no one should be considered illegal.”
College Democrats at USC President Nick Fiorillo said the organization was honored to host Harris and Newsom.
“This is a critical endorsement at this point in the campaign and Lieutenant Governor Newsom is one of our most important leaders,” Fiorillo said. “This is part of what makes USC special — leaders in our state, country and world know that USC is the kind of place where important decisions and announcements are made. We are so thrilled that our members and the USC student body were able to hear from and meet them.”

This week, and for the first time all semester, a resolution failed when brought to a vote on the Undergraduate Student Government Senate floor. The rejection of the resolution, which if passed would have added an external advocacy director position to USG, sent a clear and resounding message: Partisanship has no place in USG.
Elizabeth Gu | Daily Trojan
But, if this week’s senate vote is to act as more than just a symbolic gesture against partisanship, then it is time that USG works to amend its bylaws and Elections Code to truly take a stand against partisan interference in its elections.
Earlier this week, a Daily Trojan investigation revealed ties between USG President Austin Dunn and Turning Point USA, a conservative nonprofit that has been accused of meddling in student elections across the country. In documents reviewed by the Daily Trojan, both USC and Dunn’s name were listed in a donor-aimed brochure released by Turning Point.
Dunn was among the names of more than 50 other campus leaders nationwide whom the organization claimed to help win their elections. Dunn spoke to the Daily Trojan, saying that the group made contact with him during his successful 2016 bid for USG vice president. As the Daily Trojan report mentioned, nowhere in the Elections Code does it strictly outlaw outside, partisan influences, and it is this ambiguity that allows outside influences to gain a foothold in student governmental proceedings.
But this isn’t the purpose of USG. They should be about tackling the issues that exist on the USC campus and that are important to USC students. Of course, all students will possess their own political ideologies — and that’s something to be encouraged — but college is also the time for young people to explore and test their convictions. For student candidates to be beholden to partisan interests, driven by the money and influence in the outside political spheres, not only would be counterproductive to students’ testing of their own political views, but also would run contrary to the non-partisan commitment of USG.
Regardless of the extent to which a relationship between Dunn and Turning Point existed, the fact the conservative group initiated contact with Dunn and used USC and Dunn specifically in marketing materials, seems to run contrary to the staunchly non-partisan stance the governing body assumed this week.
Furthermore, the fact that USG should remain non-partisan is a common sentiment within the organization. During the course of the Daily Trojan’s investigation, nearly a dozen former or current USG officials stated that partisanship does not and should not have a place in student government. And yet, due to an ambiguous Elections Code, it can — and, at least to an extent in the case of Dunn — it has. 
It is naive to believe that political groups will not take advantage of student governments or that outside endorsements have no bearing on the outcomes of elections or agendas set by those elected. This is essentially the stance USG has taken by leaving it unacknowledged in the Elections Code. Student leaders are the future leaders of the world. Gaining access to them through the societal microcosms that are university campuses is in political groups’ best interests. But it’s not in students’, the universities’ or student governments’.
Therefore, the USG Elections Code and bylaws should be amended to safeguard against election interference and partisan influences. It is not enough just to ban external donations, as the current Elections Code does. Accepting campaign help from partisan groups outside of the USC campus community should be outlawed as well. Or at the very least, the Elections Code should more clearly delineate how candidates should respond to and communicate with outside political organizations when — and it’s when, not if — they attempt to make contact with student candidates or elected officials again.
In the Daily Trojan report, Emily Lee, the former USG elections director and the author of the 2017-18 elections code, stated that the Elections team and third parties can bring forth allegations of illegal associations between a candidate and an outside political group, but once an official is elected, the investigation process is not as clear cut.
“Well that’s something that we have the press for, right?” Lee said.
To an extent this is true. But now, the onus is shifted back onto USG to implement meaningful reform to assure that a similar situation — or one more serious — does not happen again.
And that is something that only USG can do.

Lily Vaughan | Daily Trojan
Two years ago, the USC College Democrats hosted then-Attorney General Kamala Harris at a rally at Ronald Tutor Campus Center; in January, the 49th Empowerment Congress hosted a gubernatorial debate between six of the major contenders for the California gubernatorial election here at USC. This Friday, the USC College Democrats and the Unruh Associates are hosting Lt. Gov. of California Gavin Newsom for a campaign event as part of his run for the governor’s seat. What we can then conclude, of course, is something USC and its students so often fail to acknowledge: This campus is politically important and politically relevant — even if the general campus reputation is one of a student body remarkably less engaged than those events would suggest.
Nonetheless, part of being the preeminent college campus in Southern California is getting to enjoy the interest of major campaigns as they walk through our brick-laden corridors and address jubilant crowds in our auditoriums. But none of this means much if the students on campus fail to acknowledge and become active in the face of the state’s most major ongoing campaigns: the open gubernatorial seat and Sen. Dianne Feinstein’s reelection.
Although I’ve said it before, I’ll say it again — in my book, part of what was wrong with the Bernie Revolution movement of 2016 is that summative overhaul of the preexisting political system — the interaction of the parties, interest groups, lobbying efforts, state-level governments, non-governmental organizations and all — cannot really come from the top unless someone has taken the time to lay the groundwork at the bottom. You can’t pay no mind to any of your local, district or statewide races, wake up to the presidential election and suddenly demand radical change. 
Newsom — if he is elected to the governor’s office — will have a dramatically stronger impact on your day-to-day life either as a student here or a California resident, if you are one, than ongoing political trends at the national level. The federal system exists because of this; local and statewide powers have a much easier time tangibly affecting you. 
Yet, much of the attendance of the Empowerment Congress, and the gubernatorial debate that accompanied it, can be attributed to established adults in the local community who commuted to our campus for that purpose. But why weren’t more of our 19,000 undergraduate students packing and clamoring to get in? 
Similarly, turnout for USG elections continues to dwindle — last year it stood below 30 percent. Despite the fanfare that often involves major elections, it would seem to the casual observer that most of the interest in larger campaigns must not be issue-based as we so claim — otherwise, wouldn’t the much more relevant statewide or local election receive at least a majority of that popularity? As politics slowly becomes another realm of reality entertainment, it’s hard to see whether the trend will shift in the opposite — and in my opinion, correct — direction.
We have the very fortunate advantage of attending a university campus that is large and influential enough to matter. We have the added benefit of existing in one of California’s most major cities, one with the population numbers, seminal industries and economic drive to remain highly relevant on most if not all top-billed issues and agendas. 
We wouldn’t have access to a Gavin Newsom or Antonio Villaraigosa or a Kamala Harris at Sonoma State — not the way we do here. It would be a deeply unfortunate mistake of ours, for our time left here, if we didn’t take advantage of these opportunities. 
To decide politics and civic engagement are beneath your so keenly-cultivated interest, and down-ballot politics even more so, is to throw away your voice in the future of our democracy and any hope you may have had in its ability to represent you. The system exists in a plain nature: If you don’t vote to protect your interests, they will become unimportant, and your needs will cease to be relevant. As the gubernatorial and senatorial races move forward, take advantage of the natural opportunities arriving at your doorstep. Pay attention and, for the millionth time, vote.

The Dictionary of Obscure Sorrows defines “sonder” as “the realization that each random passerby is living a life as vivid and complex as your own.” The podcast Beautiful Stories From Anonymous People, aka Beautiful/Anonymous, captures this feeling well.
The premise of the show is that the host, comedian Chris Gethard, takes a call from a random fan — the first person who sees his tweet on Twitter asking for people to call — and talks to them for a full hour. The only conditions are that Gethard cannot hang up, the caller stays anonymous and the phone call ends after exactly one hour. 
It’s an extension of the common radio practice of taking listener calls, but while these calls often limit the listener to his or her opinion about a given subject, Beautiful/Anonymous shifts the conversation — the listener becomes the subject, the random passerby gets to tell you how their life is as vivid and complex as their own. 
Every story makes you feel personally connected to the caller, makes you empathize with their problems and makes you want nothing more than for them to achieve their goals. Creating this relationship between a listener and a random caller is no small feat, but the audio platform is conducive to such a relationship — the caller is merely in your ear, free of the biases that come with vision — from the way someone dresses to their race. 
What makes Beautiful/Anonymous work so well is that it brings out sonder in all of us. 
The first episode of the show, “Ron Paul’s Baby,”  follows the life of a customer service employee — someone who’s easy to get mad at, especially when they can’t solve your problem while talking to you on the phone.
The concept of sonder and, by extension, Beautiful/Anonymous reminds us how easy it is to forget that the customer service employee we’re talking to has had to deal with frustrating phone calls — and frustrated phone callers — for hours (if not days) on end, and probably are paid a wage that leaves them living paycheck to paycheck. 
You’d never have thought that the customer service employee might have dreams and aspirations to become an comedian, but his mental health prevented him from bringing himself to pursue them. You’d never guess that his mom was in jail, or that he’d never met his dad until he was 14 years old. You’d never guess that when he was born, the doctor who delivered him was none other than politician Ron Paul. 
Beautiful/Anonymous has taught me to approach life with a greater appreciation for what I can’t understand beyond my perception of the people around me, to experience sonder in my daily life by keeping in mind that everyone’s life is subject to complexity beyond my ability to perceive it. 
I won’t lie — there have been times when my perception of someone has made me expect more from them than I should have. In a restaurant, for example, if my server isn’t doing a great job or gets an order wrong, I might become frustrated with them. 
But Beautiful/Anonymous would take me deeper into that person’s story and make me consider why they might not be doing a great job. Maybe a personal issue is causing them stress, and they aren’t paying as much attention to their work. Maybe they work multiple jobs and also have kids to take care of and haven’t gotten enough sleep lately.
There are simple practices I want to bring to my daily life to appreciate the people around me more, in recognition of their complexity — smiling and saying “thank you” to the security guards who let me in to campus and my dorm building, and putting understanding before being judgmental in my impressions of the people I meet, but don’t fully know. 
It’s hard not to believe the first impression I have of someone, or to think about the numerous people in my life beyond their interaction with me, whether it’s a student in my class who I see every day or the person who takes my Starbucks order, but Beautiful/Anonymous has taught me to always keep sonder in mind, and be intentionally aware of the intricacies of the lives of everyone around me.

USC completed its season sweep over the Oregon Ducks in a Thursday night thriller, winning by a final score of 72-70. Trailing early, the Trojans fought back to a 1-point deficit at halftime. The contest featured 12 ties and 15 lead changes.
Sophomore guard Jonah Mathews led the Men of Troy with 20 points in their match against the Oregon Ducks, while he is only averaging 9 points per game. Alex Zhang | Daily Trojan
Up 70-68 with 31 seconds to play, the Trojans (18-9, 9-5) had an opportunity to ice the victory with junior forward Chimezie Metu, who had been intentionally fouled at the line for two shots. Metu, a 75 percent free throw shooter in conference play, uncharacteristically missed both. 
Seconds later, the Ducks tied the game. It felt eerily like another blown game for the Trojans. After all, USC has lost several one-possession games this season, including two in the last two weeks against UCLA and Arizona State.
 Tonight, however, senior captain guard Jordan McLaughlin saved the win on USC’s last possession. Coming out of a timeout, McLaughlin dribbled across the court; then, off a ball screen he ran laterally from USC’s bench to the opposite sideline. Double-teamed and out of real estate, McLaughlin hooked a pass over his shoulder to Metu who stood wide open under the basket. Metu opted out of an alley-oop dunk and instead made a safer layup off the backboard. 
“I wasn’t gonna mess around with [a dunk] this time,” Metu said. 
Although head coach Andy Enfield did not exactly draw up a cross-court hook-pass for the final play of the game, he was happy with the result.
“The play call was to put the ball in our best player’s hands,” Enfield said. “[McLaughlin] is unbelievable. When he threw it up, I said, ‘That looks good to me.’” 
For McLaughlin, the pass felt natural. “It felt good coming out of my hands,” he said.
The win felt relieving, too. After three consecutive losses, every game matters immensely for the Trojans in their postseason ambitions. With this win, they remain in second place in the conference. 
However, the Trojans did not escape unscathed. With 7:57 to play in the second half, junior forward Bennie Boatwright, who is still nursing a foot injury, fell to the floor attempting to draw a charge. His left knee was banged badly, and he lay on the court for the team doctor to examine him until his teammates had to help carry him to the locker room. 
The severity of the injury remains unclear. Boatwright will likely have to undergo an MRI to determine the status of his knee. 
“[Boatwright] went out and played so hard,” Enfield said. 
“He was playing the right way. He looked great. Hopefully, it’s just a sprain.”
Normally a leading scorer, Boatwright did not score tonight for 20 minutes. Nevertheless, he found other ways to contribute, including seven rebounds. 
Sophomore guard Jonah Mathews led the team in scoring with 20 points while Metu added 18 points and 10 rebounds. McLaughlin also finished with a double-double — 11 points and 11 assists. 
On Saturday night, the Trojans will host the Oregon State Beavers.
“We will need to play with the same energy,” Enfield said. “Good down the stretch on defense and offense.”
Oregon State is led by three double-digit scorers, including dynamic sophomore forward Tres Tinkles, who averages 18.5 points, 7.0 rebounds and 3.6 assists per game. Although the Beavers rank 10th in the conference, they flew to Los Angeles on a two-game win streak.

After defending its home court against both Arizona schools last weekend, the women’s basketball team looks to take that momentum and energy on the road this weekend. The team will first face No. 9 Oregon on Friday, who will be coming back from a road sweep in Washington, before taking on No. 15 Oregon State on Sunday. Last season, the Trojans surprised everyone, especially Oregon State, by breaking their seven-game losing streak with a 70-50 win against the Beavers. The team is looking to do the same and more this time around.

“They know better than me because they did it last year,” head coach Mark Trakh said. “So, I’m going to ask them, ‘How did you beat Oregon State in front of 6,000 people?’ and they’re going to tell me and I’m going to say, ‘You’re going to do the exact same thing, OK?’ So, they know. [They did] it last year, so that’s what we are going to rely on: their experience from last year.”
All the starters, except graduate student guard Jordan Adams, who was out with a knee injury her senior year, played against the Oregon schools’ last season. In addition to experience, the starters have been averaging close to the full 40 minutes per game. With that, not only are the players’ stamina improving, but they have also been using every minute to keep practicing for the tough games to come.
“I feel like I’m in great shape,” senior guard Sadie Edwards said. “I look at it as a blessing. When I’m not in the game, I am itching to go back in … Being out there as much as I am, it makes me prepared. We’ve been in close games, we’ve got a tough weekend coming up, but there isn’t much that we haven’t seen and [the coaches] do a really good job with calling timeouts and getting us rest when we can, so I feel good about it.”
The players will have to bring that spirit to Oregon with them as they are taking on two tough teams back to back. Oregon’s sophomore guard Sabrina Ionescu is averaging 19.4 points per game in comparison to USC senior forward Kristen Simon’s 17.5. However, the Trojans have recently shown a balanced effort from all their starters — each are contributing points, rebounds and assists. Along with that, bench players, like forwards sophomore Ja’Tavia Tapley and junior Marguerite Effa, have slowly seen an increase in playing time and are making plays for their teams when they come in. 
“We are getting a really balanced effort and we’re playing together,” Edwards said. “Sharing the basketball is fun. When you play together, you play as a team, you defend. I think it’s a lot easier to go out there and play.”
The chemistry of the team is tangible. The bench is cheering in response to every point made and the team’s constant communication on the court is audible. Their season hasn’t been perfect, but Trakh is excited for where the team is headed and is only hopeful for what the future brings; he has seen positive progress from the beginning of the season until now. 
“I think it took a while to evolve there, to think rebounding, defense, assists, the team chemistry, how you relate to your team,” Trakh said. “And it’s ongoing. We’re going to keep working every day. Everything is not perfect right now, but we can work with them and they can work with each other, but I think it’s good right now and I think we are in a good place headed into our last four games.”

Before I get started, I want to apologize for yet another Winter Olympics-related column this week. But as a Korean, I feel compelled to follow up on something I wrote earlier this semester.
Ollie Jung | Daily Trojan
When North Korea announced it would send 22 athletes to PyeongChang, South Korea, last month, I was cautiously optimistic. Even though tensions between the hermit nation and the rest of the world were at their highest in recent memory, I was hopeful — hopeful that a united Korea at the Opening Ceremony and the presence of a joint women’s hockey team would show the humanity of the North Korean citizens, many of whom suffer under the most brutal regime on the planet (though I’m sure some of the athletes are beneficiaries of North Korean dictator Kim Jong-un’s corruption).
And despite the United States’ current relationship with North Korea, I was hopeful that Americans would watch the Olympics and see the Koreans’ dream of eventual unification — the identity of a singular nation, even though it has been muddled by generations of conflict.
“It would be easy to root against the athletes, considering North Korea’s threat to the United States,” I wrote in January. “But the competitors under the unified flag don’t reflect their governments.”
After the opening week of the Games, however, I now have the complete opposite concern: Politics and the novelty of the situation seem to have temporarily blinded many of us from reality.
American audiences were captivated when Kim Jong-un’s sister, Kim Yo-jong, attended the Opening Ceremony alongside South Korean president Moon Jae-in, the country’s most dovish president in more than a decade when it comes to relations with the North.
“Kim Jong-un’s Sister Turns on the Charm, Taking Pence’s Spotlight,” a New York Times headline read. The article detailed people’s objections to Vice President Mike Pence’s cold attitude toward the North Korean envoy sent to PyeongChang, while also describing the understated charisma of Kim Yo-jong.
The top comments on the article mortified me (why I dove into the cesspool of an internet comments section, I don’t know).
“With all due respect to [the] charm displayed by Jong-Un’s sister for maintaining some modicum of civility at the international event, it doesn’t take much effort to outshine the bigot Pence,” one comment read.
“Ms. Kim was polite, courteous and a positive representative of North Korea. VP Pence and wife Karen, on the other hand, were rude and disrespectful to all Olympians,” said another.
No matter how low an opinion you may have of our current administration here in the States, don’t be naive enough to let that dislike push you to suddenly sympathize with Kim Yo-jong or any other member of the North Korean leadership. Don’t give them credit for being courteous when they literally imprison their own citizens within their country while diverting every single valuable resource to the dictatorship.
It’s as simple as this: If those commenters on the New York Times website were North Koreans speaking about their own government, they would be hunted down and killed. American student Otto Warmbier died because he stole a poster. North Koreans have been executed en masse for being caught with Bibles.
All this amazing fanfare we’ve been seeing — the Opening Ceremony, the joint hockey team and the hundreds-strong cheering sections chanting, “We are one!” — it’s the manifestation of a carefully planned so-called “charm offensive” from North Korea.
Not to say that these gestures can’t be used as a unifying force, but if they work, the North’s plan would have backfired. It would be downright silly to assume that this third-generation totalitarian dictatorship, which has consistently spit in the face of basic human rights in its decades-long pursuit of nuclear weapons, has extended a genuine olive branch so abruptly, only for the likes of Pence to rebuff it.
The best-case scenario for these Games is a wholehearted South Korean embrace of the Northern people — not its regime.
I still dream of living in a unified Korea someday — the land my grandfather once lived in, before he was forced to leave his parents as a teenager and escape south to avoid being forcibly conscripted into the Communist forces. I hope these three weeks in PyeongChang bring us a step closer to that reality.
But when things inevitably return to more or less the status quo at the end of the month, it won’t be because of Pence, President Donald Trump or anyone else other than the human skidmark named Kim Jong-un and those who ally with him.

Since Fall 2015, USC Price School of Public Policy assistant professor Alexandra Graddy-Reed has taught classes about nonprofits, philanthropy and social innovation. When she is not in the classroom, Graddy-Reed conducts research about the effectiveness of nonprofit organizations, and was recently awarded a $10,000 grant.
USC Price School of Public Policy assistant professor Alexandra Graddy-Reed won the award for her research into the overhead costs of nonprofits and their effects on donations. Photo courtesy of Alexandra Graddy-Reed.
Last November, Graddy-Reed was named as the inaugural recipient of the Dugan Research Award for Philanthropic Impact. Her research examines the ways in which nonprofits’ overhead ratios — which include the share of expenditures that go to administrative, operating and fundraising costs — affect the number of donations received.
According to Graddy-Reed, the public pressures nonprofit organizations into keeping their overhead rates to less than 20 percent. The lower the percentage, the more inclined people are to donate.
 With her research, Graddy-Reed addresses two questions: How are nonprofits reporting overhead ratios? Do the overhead ratios actually impact the donations these organizations receive?
“There’s a lot of focus in the public on these overhead ratios, and I think there’s too much focus with not enough data to say whether or not these things matter,” Graddy-Reed said. 
According to Graddy-Reed, it is important to investigate whether or not this pressure leads nonprofits to report their expenditures in alternative categories in order to minimize the overhead cost ratio.
Graddy-Reed started her research last fall and received seed funding from the USC Center on Philanthropy and Public Policy. According to USC Price Dean Jack H. Knott, Graddy-Reed’s being named the inaugural recipient of the Dugan Research Award is a “tremendous honor, and a very well-deserved one.”
“Professor Graddy-Reed is utilizing innovative data analysis approaches to examine important issues involving charity ratings, nonprofit revenues and donor behavior,” Knott said in an email to the Daily Trojan. “Her work will help further our understanding of philanthropic impact — and how to measure it more effectively.”
The award, presented by the Association for Research on Nonprofit Organizations and Voluntary Action and Charity Navigator, comes with the opportunity to present the study at the ARNOVA annual conference. Additionally, Graddy-Reed has been granted access to Charity Navigator’s information database, which offers exclusive information about various nonprofits.
Before receiving access, she used public data from the Internal Revenue Service for her research.
“[Charity Navigator’s data] is key,” Graddy-Reed said. “I have access to all of Charity Navigator’s reports and ratings of all nonprofits that they rate … It’s a big time saver.”
Graddy-Reed said she is encouraged by how people have expressed interest in addressing this issue and that nonprofits are open to her conducting this research.
“It’s very exciting,” Graddy-Reed said. “It’s an amazing opportunity … [This research] can lead to many other research projects in the future.”

Students and faculty members filled the Wallis Annenberg Hall on Thursday to see actress and writer Anna Deavere Smith speak in the third installment of USC Annenberg-HBO Diverse Voices Forum series. The event was moderated by Director of the School of Communication Sarah Banet-Weiser.
Anna Deavere Smith, an actress, writer and professor, spoke about her upcoming film Notes from the Field. Emily Smith | Daily Trojan
Smith, known widely for her play Twilight: Los Angeles, 1992, spoke about her upcoming film Notes from the Field, which will premiere Feb. 24 on HBO.
In Notes from the Field, which has been adapted from the stage to the screen, Smith said she depicted the personal accounts of students, parents, teachers and administrators caught in America’s school-to-prison pipeline, the disproportionate tendency of disadvantaged students end up going from school to prison.
In 2011, Smith was introduced to the concept of the school-to-prison pipeline and recounted the story of a Baltimore child who peed in a watercooler and was taken to jail.
“That really blew my mind!” Smith said. “I couldn’t believe something like that could happen in my hometown. That was when I realized that rich kids, even middle class kids, get the opportunity [to be] mischievous while poor kids are met with a path to prison.”
Smith said that this story served as the catalyst for both her play and Notes from the Field. Drawn from over 250 interviews of people living and working within a challenged system, she said she decided to elucidate a lost generation of American youth through her stimulating portrayal of 18 characters. In them, she hopes to inspire awareness and change. 
As an actress that Banet-Weiser said “brings souls to life,” Smith noted that history builds a context in which people won’t pursue a better future.
“The knowledge of history is the opposite of hopelessness,” Smith said. “I want the people that watch this to be inspired to act on it.”
Wyatt Vinchi, a senior majoring in theatre, said he was empowered by Smith’s work.
“She has no fears when she is conveying her truth, and especially during our political climate, we need strong voices,” Vinchi said. “She is one of my invisible mentors. This was incredible.”

USC reached an $89,142 settlement with the California Department of Toxic Substances Control for alleged violations of the California Health and Safety Code involving unauthorized transport and storage of hazardous waste, DTSC said in a press release Wednesday. 
According to settlement documents, between 2013 and 2015, USC allegedly shipped 7.5 tons of hazardous waste including the harmful chemicals toluene, hydrochloric acid and chloroform to its Soto Street Building Annex in Los Angeles, which houses USC Environmental Health and Safety and DPS offices. The settlement also alleges that USC failed to prepare a manifest to inform the DTSC of the waste transportation. 
USC reached the settlement with DTSC in mid-December last year. Of the $89,142, $47,142 was paid out to the DTSC, and $42,000 was given to ‘supplemental environmental projects,’ the settlement documents say, through a DTSC program that encourages using settlement cases to fund programs to improve California environmental health. 
The payments include a $35,000 payment to the Coalition for Clean Air, which will use the money to install community-based air quality monitoring devices in the Wilmington-San Pedro region of Los Angeles, according to the DTSC news release. 
“We expect to add 50 to 100 new monitors that will collect data about the levels of health destroying particulate matter emitted from trucks, refineries and rail yards, particularly along the Alameda Corridor,” Victor Polanco, a CCA project manager, said in an email to the Daily Trojan.
Furthermore, USC is making a $7,000 payment to Nurturing Students with Nature to aid its goal of providing environmental education to urban Los Angeles students, through experiences in nature spaces throughout the region. 
“DTSC continues to hold violators accountable and protect public health, and at the same time promote projects that benefit communities most burdened by pollution,” DTSC Director Barbara Lee said in statement emailed to the Daily Trojan. “The Department appreciates that USC agreed to fund two projects that will help improve the lives and health outcomes of some of California’s most vulnerable residents.”
Along with the payments, USC is subject to increased inspection by DTSC to ensure future compliance with hazardous waste regulations, the settlement documents say. 
University administration said that while they deny the allegations, they chose to settle putting funds into community health projects rather than toward a legal case with DTSC. 
“USC disputes the allegations by DTSC, but instead of expending resources on litigation with DTSC at this time, it makes better sense to put those resources to good use on projects that protect community health,” USC administration said in a statement emailed to the Daily Trojan. “USC fully complies with environmental laws and puts community health front and center as a priority.”
CORRECTION: A previous version of this article incorrectly stated, and contained a photo that incorrectly identified, the building in which USC allegedly stored hazardous waste. The photo has been removed. The Daily Trojan regrets this error.
