More than 30 supporters and students gathered in front of Tommy Trojan, where from labor union UNITE HERE Local 11 representative Hannah Petersen announced they would march to President Carol Folt’s office to demand a meeting to talk about workers’ rights.
Students sang “This Little Light of Mine” and “De Colores” as they waited in the hallway of Bovard Auditorium for this additional conference with Folt as part of a demonstration held in support of USC workers by UNITE HERE Local 11 following a meeting between USC workers and Folt Tuesday. 
Nina Rosser, a graduate student studying law, said the workers had four demands from the University, which included increasing wages so they would not have to take on additional jobs to make ends meet, guaranteeing a 40-hour work week; maintaining current health care benefits; and establishing a pension program for workers who have been with USC at least 30 years. 
The organizers shared with demonstrators stories of workers they had talked to, many of whom had two to three jobs to support their families and did not have time to wait a month for the administrators to listen to their demands. 
When the demonstrators reached Folt’s office at Bovard, they were stopped by the security guard on duty, and additional officers from the Department of Public Safety were called for backup. Only two representatives were allowed to go up to meet Chief of Staff Rene Pak, as Folt was out of town. 
While SCALE representatives Rosser and Ada Marys Lorenzana went up for a two-minute meeting with Pak, the rest of the supporters sang songs outside Bovard so administrators could hear their voices.
“It sent a message for sure,” said Lorenzana, a junior majoring in political science. “It was just two of us in there — we could hear everyone outside and [people in the building] could as well. So it’s nice to know that it’s not just two people showing up.”
Once the meeting with Pak ended, the demonstrators marched to Von KleinSmid Center to discuss the protest and make future plans to set up a meeting with Folt. 
“I think it’s easy for students to think that the struggles, of workers are somehow separate from their own struggles and that’s simply not the case,” Lorenzana said. “We all have to be responsible and willing to show up for one another.”
Ryan Boyd, an assistant professor in the Writing Department, was the only faculty member present at the demonstration. Boyd said it was necessary for students to know how to get involved in democracy and labor issues they have a stake in. 
“I think that’s really wonderful to know that students are engaged and activated and interested in things that affect the University and the whole community because the workers who are negotiating for a living wage are people without whom the University would not function,” Boyd said. 
Undergraduate Student Government Sen. Christopher McMorran, who attended the demonstration, said he had been involved with workers’ rights and helped pass a resolution last semester to make sure they were treated with respect during contract negotiations. 
“My big thing is making sure that when USG passes a resolution, we don’t just stop there — we follow up and actually act on it, so this is a big part of that,” McMorran said. “We can’t just write on a piece of paper that we’re supporting workers — we need to actually physically support them.”
McMorran said it was encouraging to see how many students showed up to support the workers and how going forward it would be important to respect both the workers and the University during negotiations. 
“I think that Dr. Folt has been incredibly responsive about a lot of other areas of policy that USC has been concerned about,” McMorran said. “There’s been a noticeable silence on this issue, so we’d like to just get some follow-up on that, even if it’s just a meeting … letting us know what’s going on.”
Lorenzana said she did not believe of the negotiations had led to concrete results. She added that even with student support on the issue, they had been unable to schedule an additional appointment with Folt. 
“There [have] been four negotiations with the University and they have yet to respond to any of the demands I mentioned,” Lorenzana said. “It’s kind of just a lot of back and forth … they just simply have ignored those demands. Right now, we can’t even get a meeting with President Folt. We have to fight to get two minutes of the time of the Chief of Staff.”
In a statement to the Daily Trojan, USC wrote that it is currently working with UNITE HERE Local 11 to achieve a fair agreement with workers. 
“We believe the University offers competitive compensation and exemplary benefits that make it a place people want to work,” the statement read. “We look forward to continued discussions with the union’s bargaining team and working together toward a new contract.”
Demonstrators said they would keep protesting until they got a chance to meet Folt for a conference about worker demands. 
“We’re just going to keep showing up until they hear us, and they have a duty to hear us,” Lorenzana said. “Like I said, we are students here. We pay to keep this University running and they have a duty to us and they have a duty to the workers.”

“Full House” actress Lori Loughlin and her husband, fashion designer Mossimo Giannulli, will stand trial in October for their role in the Operation Varsity Blues admissions scandal, a judge ruled in federal court Thursday.
Loughlin and Giannulli paid $500,000 between October 2016 and February 2018 for senior associate athletic director Donna Heinel to falsely designate their two daughters as crew recruits to secure admission to USC. They claim they believed the payments were legitimate donations, according to court documents. 
Jury selection for the trial will begin Sept. 28, and the court proceedings will commence Oct. 5, Judge Nathaniel Gorton said in court Thursday. The defendants will be composed of all parents named in the case who paid for their children’s admission to the University, and the trial will last up to four weeks, Gorton said. Seven other parents named in the case will stand trial beginning Jan. 11, 2021.
The hearing follows a motion Loughlin and Giannulli filed in court Wednesday requesting a postponement of the setting of their trial date after the federal government released additional evidence in the case to the couple’s defense. They also filed a document requesting specific groupings of parents named in the admissions case for trial based on the parents’ area of involvement in the scheme, with Loughlin, Giannulli, Gamal Abdelaziz, Diane and Todd Blake and John Wilson — all of whom paid Singer to arrange their children’s fraudulent admission to USC as athletic recruits — in the first grouping.
Among the evidence the government released Wednesday was a note from scheme organizer William “Rick” Singer’s iPhone that he wrote following a phone call with FBI investigators. In the note, Singer stated that he deliberately tricked parents, including Loughlin and Giannulli, into believing the money they paid would be donated to University programs and that investigators asked him to testify that the parents knew their payments would be used as bribes.
“They continue to ask me to tell a fib and not restate what I told my clients as to where there money was going — to the program not the coach and that it was a donation and they want it to be a payment,” the note read. 
The defense argued that the delay in the release of evidence cast doubt on the government’s motives in the case and stated that it violated the Brady law, which requires the prosecution to disclose evidence relevant to the defendant’s argument within 30 days of indictment. The Operation Varsity Blues charges were filed March 5, 2019.
“This belated discovery … is devastating to the Government’s case and demonstrates that the Government has been improperly withholding core exculpatory information, employing a ‘win at all costs’ effort rather than following their obligation to do justice,” the defense stated in a motion filed Wednesday. The prosecution released the iPhone note Wednesday with a statement that it would disclose the remaining notes shortly.
Loughlin and Giannulli have pleaded not guilty to conspiracy to commit mail and wire fraud and honest services mail and wire fraud, conspiracy to commit federal programs bribery and conspiracy to commit money laundering. They are among 19 parents in the admissions case with ties to USC, nine of whom have pleaded not guilty and will go to trial this fall.

Located in Exposition Park, the California African American Museum stands in majesty. 
The words “free admission” are printed in large font near the opening doors, letting everyone who passes by know one thing: The cultural content inside the museum is accessible to all. 
That is something the CAAM has taken pride in ever since its official opening in 1981, offering a balance between art and history to it’s visitors. The museum has five galleries that rotate twice a year: two art, two history and one permanent collection.
Each exhibit has a life of its own. From “Dust My Broom: Southern Vernacular from the Permanent Collection” to “Making Mammy: A Caricature of Black Womanhood, 1840-1940,” every exhibit contains lively elements that engage viewers.
CAAM Executive Director George Davis made telling history with a more compelling, multimedia approach one of his objectives since joining the museum in 2015. Davis, who has a background in entertainment and broadcasting and received his MBA from USC in 1996, wanted to make the content more alluring to younger audience members. 
“I just felt the need to shake it up quite a bit and that we needed to go much more Instagram, much more social media savvy and have programming that would really resonate and be relevant with [younger people],” Davis said. 
To do this, the museum worked on a rebranding process that would make the institution more welcoming and relevant to youth. 
“I just think that people [who are] younger just don’t want information that’s told the same way their parents receive information,” Davis said. “They still are concerned about the same kind of issues, but they just want to hear from people that they can relate to, and it could be older people, but they need to speak the right language.”
The museum is evolving its storytelling by displaying more contemporary art exhibits featuring younger artists, more visuals and videos in order to illuminate the rich history of the Black Californian community. 
Currently, the CAAM has a lively exhibit named “Cross Colours: Black Fashion in the 20th Century.” The exhibit, curated by Tyree Boyd-Pates and Taylor Bythewood-Porter, pulls together contemporary art that showcases Black culture and Afrocentrism. The exhibit is centered around the clothing brand Cross Colours, an apparel line that gained traction when Will Smith wore its products on “The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air.” 
As soon as a visitor steps through the doorway of the “Cross Colours” exhibit, they are greeted by throwback tunes and more color than an art palette. The apparel is placed all throughout the room, as well as visuals and interactive elements for visitors. 
For Kennedy Hill, a freshman majoring in acting and a student worker at CAAM, “Cross Colours” is one of her favorite exhibits. A piece that caught her eye was a wall with the question “How do you use fashion to make a statement?” Visitors are then able to grab a marker and write their responses on the wall. 
Hill hopes students will have learned something once they leave the museum. 
“There’s so much to just look at, and the artwork is beautiful, but the artwork does have a lot of meaning to it,” Hill said. “And just it being an African American museum, I think that that’s important to get that aspect of art that isn’t usually put on [as] the best or just doesn’t have that representation in the world.”
Although Hill has only recently started working at the museum, she recalls the CAAM being one of the main reasons she chose USC. 
“When I was deciding on if I wanted to go to USC, that was one of the places that I went to that kind of helped me with my decision,” Hill said. “I just thought [it] was so cool that it’s free for the community to just go to the museum, and it’s just right across from the school.”
Sofia Reyes, a sophomore majoring in health promotion and disease prevention, said the CAAM also influenced her college choice. 
“The only reason why I actually knew about USC and why I applied here is because of the CAAM and its neighboring museums,” Reyes said. “[The CAAM] has really great exposure and really great ability of interaction. It’s very easy to understand and have a message come across to anyone of any age and of any educational standing.”
One of Reyes’ most memorable experiences at the CAAM was the opportunity to organize an event with her writing class to bring formerly incarcerated men to a Visions and Voices event held at the museum. The event, titled “Jails and Justice: Rethinking Public Safety through the Arts,” discussed the rhetoric of incarceration and racism in the United States. 
“[The event] was just such a safe space,” Reyes said. “And just having the USC community, the activist community and the regular South Central community interact in that place — it was priceless, and I will remember that forever.”
The CAAM hosts other educational programs similar to “Jails and Justice” year-round. The programs are often tied to the current exhibits that the CAAM changes twice a year. 
“We try to find topics that are compelling, whether it’s about the elections this year, or census, or some hashtag movements or there’s a big issue with African American women about natural hair, also dealing with people’s health,” Davis said. “So we might do yoga or we might do dance. We do a lot of non-traditional type public programs that we feel really tie us and even further bond with our audience.”
Apart from the exhibits and programs, a visitor never knows who they might see at the museum. Hill saw Timothy Washington, the artist behind the mixed-media piece “Citizen/Ship,” during a work shift. 
“He had on these green checkered pants and those cross earrings just on one ear and this silly, crazy hat,” Hill said. “I was like ‘Aw, this man seems so cool,’” Hill said. “I didn’t really get to talk to him, but he was looking at all the art, and then later on throughout the day, I found out that it was actually Timothy Washington who made one of the art exhibits.”
And that is exactly what the CAAM does — it brings people from all walks of life together to experience unapologetic Black culture. 
Although Black History Month consists of just 29 days (this year, anyway), the CAAM is less than a mile away from USC’s campus, reminding visitors year-round of the legacy of African Americans in the western United States. 
“If Black History Month was to go away, we would still be working really hard to have great exhibits, great programs and really expose the broader community to the great art and unique history of African Americans in California,” Davis said. 
As the CAAM sets out to accomplish this mission, its passion and dedication leave visitors with three vital gifts: art, history and culture.
