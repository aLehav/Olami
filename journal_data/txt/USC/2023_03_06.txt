Finding great LGBTQIA+ representation can be hard to come by, even with the addition of multimedia streaming. From harmful stereotypes to queerbaiting, the queer media of today is far from perfect. Digging through the depths of Twitter or asking every single one of your LGBTQIA+ friends what they’ve been watching lately can be such a hassle. Look no further because what you’re about to read is a compiled list of some of the most authentic queer representations in film and television this year.
“The Last of Us” – HBO Max
TV show fanatics and video game fans alike, you won’t want to miss this one. A video game first, “The Last of Us” tells the story of post-apocalypse survivor Joel (Pedro Pascal), and his journey to protect the potential key to saving humanity, a 14-year-old girl. 
The game has a list of LGBTQIA+ characters that appear throughout its parts, some of which have already been introduced in the show as well. From a beautiful old gay couple’s love story to a young lesbian navigating her life, the representation is blossoming throughout the show. 
Queer representation tends to be heavily stereotyped or made only about the character’s queerness, but a show like “The Last of Us” follows such a complex post-apocalyptic story, which allows it to explore these different identities within the world, rather than ostracizing them purely for token representation — and that’s wonderful.
“9-1-1: Lone Star” – Hulu, FOX NOW
If you’re into procedural dramas or want a show you can watch on cable (if you even know what that is) AND on streaming, this one’s for you. “9-1-1: Lone Star” is the critically acclaimed spin off of Ryan Murphy’s “9-1-1”. It follows a father-son firefighting duo, Owen (Rob Lowe) and T.K. Strand (Ronen Rubinstein), as they relocate from the Big Apple to Austin, Texas, tasked with rebuilding the 126 fire station after a devastating accident left most of the original station members dead.
As for queer representation, this show does not disappoint. Entering season four with trans, gay and bisexual major characters, this show has beautifully complex LGBTQIA+ storylines. It does a good job of representing groups that don’t usually have the spotlight and is definitely worth tuning in. You can watch it Tuesdays at 8 p.m. on FOX NOW or Hulu the day after.
“Knock at the Cabin” – In Theaters
For all the movie theater fanatics out there, this one’s for you. Don’t worry streaming enthusiasts, you can rent/buy it on platforms like Amazon Prime Video, Apple TV+, etc., too. This psychological horror film follows Wen (Kristen Cui) and her two dads as their vacation to a cabin in Pennsylvania takes a dark turn. The family is taken hostage by four people who ask them to make an impossible decision to save the world. They are faced with the ultimate decision of choosing to sacrifice one of their own. Who will it be?
This movie masterfully juggled the hard to come by split between casual and “in your face” queer representation. The movie showcases the beauty of queer love and family, while also allowing a complex horror plot to take place outside of that as well. It’s a must watch.
“Erin’s Guide to Kissing Girls” – Rent/Buy on Amazon Prime Video
After winning awards at both the 2021 LA Femme International Film Festival and 2022 Mill Valley Film Festival, you can now watch “Erin’s Guide to Kissing Girls” on Amazon Prime Video, VUDU, iTunes and Google Play. This classic queer coming-of-age story focuses on soon-to-be middle school graduate, Erin (Elliot Stocking), as she navigates being out, keeping her friendships alive and completing her ultimate plan of asking her crush to the dance.
This movie is something a lot of us wish we had growing up. Having this genre of story follow a queer lead, is a huge win for the LGBTQIA+ community.
“Yellowjackets” – Showtime
Heading into its second season, “Yellowjackets” has accumulated a new generation of queer viewers. The first season followed a high school girls’ soccer team after their plane crashed in the middle of the forest, leaving them far from any signs of civilization. The show has a dual-plot structure following the initial crash in 1990 and that of the survivors in the present.
This show also does a decent job with balancing focusing on queer identities and characters’ overall stories. While sexuality is a relevant topic for some characters within the show, it’s often not the driving factor of any hardship for the beloved queer characters. It’s important to note that the 1990s weren’t the easiest time to be LGBTQIA+. While the show does well taking on that conflict, it’s also not the main focus. The audience gets to see fully fleshed out, majorly complex arcs for each character regardless of their identity.
Season 2 comes to Showtime on March 24, and airs on the network March 26, giving you plenty of time to catch up on Season 1.
Mass media has come so far in terms of LGBTQIA+ representation, but it also still has a long way to go. Hurtful stereotypes, queerbaiting and a lack of representation (especially trans/gender non-conforming representation) are battles the entertainment industry have yet to completely overcome. That being said, the TV shows and movies set to premiere this year look very promising in terms of queer narratives. As time passes, I hope you all are able to see yourselves represented on screen.

If you haven’t watched the Alex Murdaugh double murder trial at all this past month, I recommend you do — not only to listen to a grown man call his son “Paw-Paw” as a nickname, but also to see justice come crashing down on a powerful man from an equally powerful legal dynasty that thought they could escape it all. But, if you’re not into the legalese, I can sum this case, and the state of justice in the South, up for you in just one sentence, borrowing a few words from the esteemed Reba McEntire: “Don’t trust your soul to no backwoods Southern lawyer.”
Murdaugh’s case was speedy, wrapping up in just around 28 days — surprising considering the circumstances. The Murdaughs held political power in the South Carolina Lowcountry for generations, occupying the office of solicitor general until Alex Murdaugh fell off the nepotism wagon and ended nearly 87 years of single-family rule of the office. But this isn’t meant to be about the Murdaughs. The arm of the law crashed down on them and dealt a justified blow just about as quickly as you could expect the law to do in a trial with as much media frenzy behind it as the Murdaugh trial has. 
No, this is about justice, still long denied. This is about Ahmaud Arbery. Although his murderers have been locked up, and the key has been tossed away (hopefully for good), there’s one person involved in his case that has yet to see her day in court for what she’s done, or rather — what she’s failed to do. That person is former local District Attorney Jackie Johnson.
Small-town corruption is not a phenomenon exclusively found in the South, but in a region still home to the Black Belt and generations of Black Americans, this phenomenon has disastrous consequences. Corruption of state and local judges is horrible in itself — especially when it comes to the sentencing phase of a court case. A Reuters investigation found that in the past 12 years alone, out of the thousands of cases that they reviewed involving judges who were repeatedly engaged in misconduct, 9 out of 10 judges were able to keep their jobs. But, on the other side of the bench, there’s another with arguably just as much power, and just as much discretion — district attorneys.
Jackie Johnson has still yet to be arraigned. She’s being charged with meddling in the investigation police conducted on the case. Generally, district attorneys are considered the top law enforcement in their respective counties, and while they’re not the uniformed cops and sheriffs you’d think of when you hear the words “law enforcement,” DAs work very closely with the police when they’re deciding whether or not to prosecute a crime. In Johnson’s case, she openly waded into a cesspool of conflicts of interest with her blinders on. One of the murderers, who had previously served as an investigator at the district attorney’s office, called her asking for advice the day after Arbery was murdered. Between then and May 5, 2020, they made an additional 16 calls to each other. I’d say that’s 16 too many. Before she eventually recused herself from the case, she asked a neighboring district attorney — who himself had previously undisclosed conflicts of interest — to review the shooting.
It shouldn’t be lost on us that, in Jackie Johnson’s case, we had a clear picture of a white district attorney dragging her feet and mucking up a serious case, all to give her white allies a bit of free time. White comfort finds itself at home in the Southern halls of justice, and the “good old boys” club that it breeds has unforgiving and brutal repercussions for those that find themselves a victim of this kind of culture. It’s going to take a long time and large, coordinated efforts to elect ethical DAs to districts all across the South — and across the nation, but in the meantime, I think the first step is to include prosecutors and district attorneys in the conversation about law enforcement accountability. If we can’t have upstanding uniformed law enforcement, we at least need decent, ethical district attorneys that know when to prosecute and recuse themselves. But when we have neither, we are in for a world of false convictions, seedy corruption and destroyed lives. And until Jackie Johnson sees her day in court, justice for Ahmaud Arbery and his family is delayed and denied.

Most of the time, I watch soccer in Spanish. I feel it best encapsulates the drama of the sport, and the cadence of the language exquisitely suits the rhythm of the beautiful game. However, during the FIFA World Cup, endlessly confronted with FOX Sports’ attempt to cover the matches, I noticed something off when they were covering Argentina’s games: they didn’t know what to call the players.
In Spanish, the people of Argentina are called Argentinos. Seems simple enough. It follows a general standard for nationalities set within the language. But, for whatever reason, English speakers have decided to refer to los Argentinos as Argentinians. Or Argentines. Or, actually, they use both.
The fact that Argentina holds this unique position in the English language is one that has resulted from factors pertaining to history and the nature of language itself. Languages evolve much like organisms, in the sense that stronger words — ones that are used more often — tend to outcompete weaker ones and eventually replace them as people adopt the new word. 
Such evolution is most evidently seen in irregular verbs, as through the evolution of English, irregularly conjugated verbs were and are slowly replaced by their more regular counterparts. It’s the reason why we say “helped” instead of “holp,” although I kind of wish the latter stuck around. The verbs that retain irregularity today are the ones that are most commonly used: we say “had” instead of “haved” and “broke” instead of “breaked.” This kind of evolution can be witnessed today: You can be both newly wed or newly wedded.
The reason that the name for the people of Argentina became caught in this struggle is the product of nearly two centuries of history. After it declared independence in 1816, Argentina grew itself to become the nation with the world’s highest GDP by the end of the 19th century. Prior to and during this time as an economic powerhouse, the English name for los Argentinos was solidly “Argentines,” based on the Latin conjugation. Immigrants fleeing poverty and persecution in Europe often had to make the choice between the United States and Argentina — many choosing to become Argentine. All was well until the first military coup in 1930, which set the precedent for decades of individual and economic limitation by a ruthless dictatorship. Argentina’s economy tanked, and so did its presence on the world stage, save for a few phenomenal World Cups.
Thus began the rise of the word Argentinian: a regular word-form used to describe a nation unfortunately declining in Anglo-centric relevance. This shift from Latin to English suffix is a perceptible, linguistic indicator of Argentina’s recession from the forefront of Anglican culture. While the British have been left seething over the Falkland Wars and Maradona’s hand of God for the past four decades, Americans have been missing out on — in my personal, mildly biased opinion — one of the richest cultures and traditions out there.
Argentina is the birthplace of the modern ballpoint pen, bypass surgery and the use of fingerprints in forensic analysis. We (allegedly) invented dulce de leche, a caramel-like sauce with milk as its main ingredient, revolutionizing patisserie. We have produced some of the greatest writers since the dawn of the 19th century, including the legendary José Hernández, Jorge Luis Borges and Quino. We invented tango. And, of course, there is our fútbol.
The above list is but a fraction of the plethora of gifts that Argentina has bestowed upon the world, so it seems only right that the English-speaking world should know what to call its people. If not, at least, to give proper soccer commentary.
In the Argentine camp is Jorge Luis Borges, a writer famed for being snubbed of the Nobel Prize in Literature, who argues that the usage of Argentine makes sense, as it better reflects its Spanish counterpart, “Argentino.” To say “Argentinian” is like saying “Argentiniano,” which is incorrect. A very succinct and elegant solution.
But the solution, as most are, is not necessarily that simple. My family members living in the states actually describe themselves as “Argentinian,” since it is much easier for them to assume the word should follow regular grammatical rules rather than learning yet another irregular word-form. What further complicates the situation is that the imposition of an irregular suffix on English-speaking Argentinos is a means of restricting what they can actually call themselves. It’s a situation that becomes problematic given that outsiders would be altering the linguistic identity of the hundreds of thousands of emigrated Argentines speaking English. A similar issue occurred with the labeling of the Latino/a community as “Latinx,” a form of gender neutrality derived from English.
Ultimately, the decision lies on the individual. If they wish to honor the original Spanish and reference the golden era of Argentina, they can use Argentine. If they wish to adopt the new suffix for ease, they can use Argentinian.
Personally, I use both, but not interchangeably. I believe that the Argentine people have been blessed with a unique opportunity to refer to themselves in a more nuanced manner given they have two different words to call themselves, each with their own cadence and weight. Borges said that English is composed of duplets: words with Germanic and Latin roots that, while similar, are subtly different. This quirk of the language has great potential.
In most contexts, I call myself Argentine, as I feel it honors the good of the country and its incredible culture. And while we are a nation defined by passion — just look to the post FIFA World Cup celebrations last year — we also love to laugh, so I use “Argentinian” when making jokes. I feel that the rhythm and levity of the word suits a self-jab excellently.
Why do I care so much about a minor linguistic difference? Because I’m Argentinian.
But why do I think it’s important? Because I am Argentine.

Colombian American singer Kali Uchis’s third studio album, “Red Moon in Venus,” was released March 3. Staying true to her established R&B voice, Uchis explores what love means to her. 
Inspired by her own interest in astrology, Kali Uchis named the album after Venus, the planet of love, as well as the red moon, which is said to bring chaos and change into an individual’s life. The album is meant to represent “all the different sides of love,” including the chaos it can incite, Uchis said in an interview with Vogue.  
True to her word, Uchis succinctly and artfully captures all the different emotions love can bring to listeners. 
In the opening track “in My Garden,” Uchis asks wistfully, “Hello? Can you hear me? I just wanted to tell you, in case you forgot: I love you.” 
The twenty-five second clip of her question is preceded and followed by birds peacefully chirping in the background. It is the perfect introduction to the rest of her album — relaxed, peaceful and questioning what love feels like.
An array of different song styles guides listeners through an emotional roller-coaster as Uchis depicts different points of view on love. In one track, “Love Between…” Uchis croons softly of how beautiful love can be, singing, “Love between two human beings / Can be so wonderful.” 
In another track, “Moral Conscience,” she depicts jealousy and anger, singing “One thing about karma, that bitch will find you.” 
Kali Uchis’s music has long-possessed a sultry and relaxing quality, characteristic of the R&B style she takes inspiration from. In “Red Moon in Venus,” Uchis remains true to this voice while still showcasing her versatility through more upbeat tracks like “Happy Now.” 
Uchis pushes herself further by exploring different sounds through a few collaborations in her album. Uchis and Omar Apollo complement each other’s voices in the track “Worth the Wait.” In “Fantasy,” Uchis depicts a more playful and buoyant message with American rapper Don Toliver. In “Deserve Me,” Uchis and singer Summer Walker promote self-love and the importance of independence in a relationship by singing lyrics like “I like it better when you’re gone / I feel a little less alone” and “You don’t deserve the love I give you.” 
Standout tracks on the album include “I Wish you Roses” and “Moonlight.” “I Wish you Roses” is easily the most listened-to track on the album. In the song, Uchis sings “Just know, any love I gave you’s forever yours to keep,” while the chorus sings, “I wish you love, I wish you well / I wish you roses…” 
Evidently, the lyrics resonate with listeners. “I Wish you Roses” clocks in at over 29 million listens on Spotify. In an interview with Pitchfork, Uchis states, “This song is about being able to release people with love.” 
“Moonlight” leans into the sultry and relaxed tone that Uchis does so well. The track is just one of the many that Uchis weaves Spanish into with the chorus singing in a mix of English and Spanish, “I just want to get high with my lover / Veo una muñeca cuando miro en el espejo.” 
“Moonlight” is the song that most easily embodies the style that Uchis mastered in the past, which may be why listeners are so in love with it. As the second most-listened song on the album, “Moonlight” sits at over 8 million listens on Spotify. 
Uchis ends the 15-song album with her track “Happy Now.” After fluidly alternating between such a wide-ranging array of emotions throughout the album, “Happy Now” ultimately leaves listeners in an uplifting and positive mood. Upbeat and optimistic, the lyrics read “Let’s you and me start over today / be happy.”
What makes “Red Moon in Venus” distinctive is Uchis’s particular and unique take on an album on love. This is not a breakup album, nor is it an “I’m in love” kind of album. Instead, this album truly is a detailed genesis of Uchis’s observations on “all the different sides of love,” both negative and positive. Her album artfully delves into how love can be simultaneously painful and rewarding and how love can be complicatedly tied to both hate and anger.

As many college students know, finding romance in the modern dating world is hard. The alluring mystery of not knowing how someone dresses, what hobbies they’re interested in and even what their cat’s name might be is entirely dispelled with social media and dating apps. Where can the hopeless romantics of the modern age turn to in search of a purer, more heartfelt romance?
USC Musical Theatre Repertory’s latest production of 1963 rom-com musical “She Loves Me,” based on a book written by Joe Masteroff with music by Jerry Bock and lyrics by Sheldon Harnick, opened at the Massman Theatre Thursday. Set during the 1930s in a Hungarian parfumerie, the musical tells an endearing and tangled love story that flourishes through the mystery of identity in an exchange of letters.
“She Loves Me” follows the dedicated, yet lonely clerk Georg Nowak (Paolo Portillo, a senior majoring in theatre), as he writes poetic letters to a faceless lover after work at Mr. Maraczek’s (Sam Guillemette, a senior majoring in neuroscience and psychology) parfumerie. When a new clerk, the young and hard-working Amalia Balish (Arya Desai, a junior majoring in theatre and journalism), joins Maraczek’s shop, their stubborn ways collide. Meanwhile, Balish also writes to a lover she has never met. Audience members hold their breath with anticipation for both Nowack and Balish as they plan to meet their supposed partners unaware that they’re writing to one another.
The heart-warming musical features many iconic songs, such as “Vanilla Ice Cream,” performed by Desai and “Ilona,” performed by Jasper Warhus, a sophomore majoring in theatre, as a charming yet devious clerk, Steven Kodaly. There are many other unforgettable characters featured, including a romantically unsuccessful clerk, Ilona Ritter (Jenna Hamdan, a junior majoring in theatre), a wholesome delivery boy, Arpad Laszlo (Jonathan Liu, a junior majoring in computer science) and a hilarious headwaiter (Gregory Ward, a junior majoring in English) who leads a dance number in the middle of a restaurant.
Desai explained that the musical came to life from the dedication of the cast and crew of MTR, an independent student production, to the craft of theatre.
“Everything is produced by students, from directing, the costumes, to casting, to the actors,” Desai said. “We’re all just students working together, there’s no faculty involved. We have a few weeks to prepare this, but it really is just a labor of love … That’s what makes it so incredible, is that [the] people that get involved with this specifically, this organization, really, really care about it.”
Alongside assistant director, junior Grace Wilkerson, director Joy Jaensubhakij, a junior majoring in theatre, sought to bring “She Loves Me” to life at USC after seeing the 2016 Broadway revival proshot in an airplane a few years ago. This is Jaensubhakij’s directorial debut and, with this, her transformation of the musical.
“I made it a point to cast our two leads as [Black, Indigenous and people of color] actors because I feel, as a BIPOC woman myself, I haven’t had a lot of opportunity to see myself in romantic comedies, especially as the lead,” Jaensubhakij said. “I really wanted to show the love and joy that BIPOC stories can have.”
Not only was casting an important directorial choice for Jaensubhakij, but also the incorporation of cultural elements in the show itself, Portillo said.
“I’m of Filipino descent, and [Desai] is part Indian, and [Jaensubhakij] really tried to bring our culture into it,” Portillo said. “So, in our costuming, [Desai] wore traditional Indian wear and I wore traditional Filipino wear called the barong, which is what you would wear for fancy dinners, or special occasions or weddings.”
MTR’s performance of “She Loves Me” left audience members grinning from ear to ear and, most importantly, believing in the power of love.
“It’s a very old show, but I feel like it’s so applicable to today’s world,” Desai said. “Like the emotions Amalia feels, the emotions Georg feels … It’s something that everyone can enjoy because everyone understands what it’s like to be in love and be excited and nervous.”

In less than one week, the NCAA Tournament selection committee will release the men’s and women’s March Madness brackets. Upon the release of the brackets, college basketball fans will eagerly await the start of both tournaments the same week. USC’s men’s and women’s basketball teams have not both made the NCAA tournament in the same year since the 1996-97 season. However, both teams have played well enough to be considered “in the field,” so let’s take a look and see if both teams of Trojans will get invited to the Big Dance, or if their invites will be lost in the mail. 
Women’s Basketball (21-9)
Women’s basketball is currently having its best season since its last NCAA tournament run in the 2013-14 season. Currently projected to be a 10 seed by ESPN’s Charlie Creme, it seems as if the Trojans should be locked into March Madness. The NET Rankings, a system the NCAA Selection Committee uses to evaluate a team’s resume, currently have USC at No. 31.
The NET Rankings are important as they provide the framework for how the bracket gets made. The NET separates every game into quadrants based on their opponents’ ranking in an attempt to describe how “good” or “bad” a loss is. Losses against teams in the third and fourth quadrants are “bad” losses; USC has no such losses. USC’s best wins include a 9-point victory over Stanford (No. 4 in the NET), a 5-point win against Oregon (No. 20) at Galen Center and a 17-point road victory over Colorado (No. 23). 
Despite losing in the first round of the Pac-12 tournament, the Trojans benefit from playing in the best conference according to RPI. In Creme’s bracket, he projects seven other teams in the Pac-12 join USC in the Big Dance. Barring a large number of unforeseen “bid stealers”, it seems as if the Trojans will make it to the NCAA tournament in Head Coach Lindsay Gottlieb’s second season. 
Men’s Basketball (22-9)
The men’s team is in a similar position to the women’s team where they haven’t fully guaranteed their spot in the NCAA tournament. ESPN’s Joe Lunardi and Fox Sports’ Mike DeCourcy currently have the Trojans as 10 and 9 seeds, respectively. USC’s NET ranking is 44 and their KenPom rating, a predictive metric used by the NCAA tournament selection committee, is 35. 
USC’s best wins are at home against UCLA (No. 4 in the NET) and Auburn (No. 32) and on the road against Colorado (No. 72). For losses, USC has two quadrant three or four losses: at home versus Florida Gulf Coast (No. 178) and at Oregon State (No. 223). Following the team’s win against Arizona State (No. 65), they have all but secured a place in the NCAA tournament.
The Trojans just have the Pac-12 tournament left on their schedule, where they will go in as the 3-seed. This means they’ll play the winner of Arizona State and Oregon State. A loss to Oregon State will likely put USC out of the tournament and ruin their resume, while a loss against Arizona State would likely keep the Trojans in the tournament. A run to the final of the tournament, if they beat Arizona, will likely mean the Trojans will be a nine seed. Winning the Pac-12 tournament might mean the committee gives USC as high as an eight seed. The key here for USC is to not lose in the quarter final if they want a stress-free Selection Sunday. Another bad loss could mean USC does not control its own destiny. 
The Verdict: 
Both teams of Trojans should enter Selection Sunday feeling hopeful and optimistic about their chances of getting an at-large bid. To recap, the only real issue on the women’s team’s resume is not beating a lot of elite teams, as the women’s team doesn’t have any bad losses. The men’s team’s resume includes a lot of losses in games against good teams and losing to Florida Gulf Coast to open the season and Oregon State in Corvallis. The women’s team should feel a lot safer, but if everything goes to plan, both teams will make it back to the NCAA tournament in the same year for the first time this century.

Usually, I’d take on more hard-hitting topics than this one, but I’m saving them for later. This edition of my column came to mind from me misreading an article thinking that Jake Gyllenhaal was actually fighting in the UFC.
He’s not. He just posed at a weigh-in for a remake of the 1989 film, “Road House” and was not getting ready for UFC 285. I was reminded, though, of other celebrities, primarily social media influencers, who are taking on professional athletes in their domain. Yes, I’m talking about internet celebrities and now apparent boxers Jake Paul and KSI.
Paul has been fighting former UFC fighters in the boxing ring over the past two years, taking them apart and making the sports world wonder, “What the hell is going on?” 
For his first bout against a professional boxer, Paul took on heavyweight champion Tyson Fury’s half-brother, Tommy, for eight rounds. Paul ended up losing by split decision, but it didn’t seem to deter him from continuing to box against other pros. He’s also garnered attention from commentators like Stephen A. Smith, who discussed Paul on “First Take” multiple times, debating if he was an actual boxer given his inexperience in the boxing realm — although he enjoys watching Paul box.
Something to note is that his Fury fight totaled an alleged 775,000 pay-per-view sales at $50 each, generating a net payout of $38.75 million. Clearly, there’s plenty of interest from viewers if the numbers are true, as it sold 200,000 more PPV purchases than Canelo Alvarez’s fight against Dmitry Bivol — making this an interesting era in boxing where social media personalities can outsell some of the best pro boxers.
The fact that Paul versus Fury could contend with one of the upcoming fights of the year, Gervonta Davis versus Ryan Garcia — which I doubt it will — is insane. Since Davis versus Garcia is one of the most anticipated match-ups in a long time, though, I’m sure it’ll blow the Paul versus Fury fight out of the water. 
Considering that there’s been talk that boxing is a dying sport, seeing as it hasn’t been reaching the sales it used to reach, this could help the sport, even if it hurts the sport as of right now. It’s no knock on the sport itself: boxing is one of, if not the toughest sports on a person’s body and also one of the most dangerous. 
After 2020, many of the largest PPV sales for combat sports events have been for UFC; The only noticeable boxing fights this decade being Tyson Fury versus Deontay Wilder, Canelo’s matches, and whoever Manny Pacquiao decides to fight in his old age. There hasn’t been consistent talk of highly anticipated fights in the boxing world for a long time. The induction of celebrities into boxing could spark new life into the sport and tap into one of the most important markets that keep so many things alive — young people. 
Other sports that are teetering off in popularity, like NASCAR, are making attempts in attracting new fans. While there’s been plenty of resistance in taking Paul and KSI seriously as boxers, it might be what the sport needs in the long run by attracting a  young fanbase. 
Many major sports, including soccer, basketball and football, have polarizing characters with players who are huge on social media. Anthony Joshua and Canelo are currenrly duking it out to be the boxer with the most Instagram followers at around 14 million each, which puts the sport’s popularity into perspective. 
The NFL has a consistent number of players with millions of followers. The NBA has mega superstar LeBron James, who’s garnered 147 million followers, many being fans who want to know what his next move is. James, along with other stars like Stephen Curry and Giannis Antetokounmpo, keep many people around the world interested in basketball. Soccer is the world’s largest sport, so there’s no surprise when the two most followed people on Instagram are Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo. 
If the boxing world uses both Paul and KSI’s Instagram followings — 22 million and 12 million, respectively —  it could be the key to reviving the sport in the long run, even if they  make it a laughing stock for a bit with their celebrity fights.

It was a bittersweet moment for senior guard Boogie Ellis and fifth-year guard Drew Peterson Saturday night as the two captains played their last-ever game at the Galen Center in cardinal and gold.
“[We are] always led by Boogie and Drew,” said Head Coach Andy Enfield following the 68-65 win over Arizona State. 
The two guards have led the way for Trojans this year on a team primarily made up of sophomores and freshmen. 
Peterson didn’t even know if he was going to suit up for Senior Night, going so far as to tell teammates he was not going to play at shootaround earlier in the day. 
“I really just tried doing everything I could to get on the floor,” Peterson said.
And even though Peterson played, it was clear his back injury hindered his game. But despite the injury, Peterson logged 31 minutes, scoring 9 points and adding 3 assists. 
While Peterson was not his usual self, Ellis more than made up for that. 
The senior guard scored 28 points to go along with 3 assists and 2 steals. Ellis has been on a hot streak as of late, averaging 22.8 points over his last 11 games. 
“[I’ve just tried] being aggressive, getting in the paint, playing off two feet, creating the contact [and] not letting the contact come to me; just hitting them first,” Ellis said on his offensive mentality. 
Enfield emphaszed Ellis’ metamorphosis into the Trojans’ clear top option on offense. 
“Boogie Ellis is probably the most improved player in the Pac-12,” Enfield said
This game, more than any, was a representation of the Trojans’ season. It was a game that could have easily been lost due to bad shooting and careless turnovers. It was a game that did not start or end pretty, but USC found a way to win regardless.
Throughout the first 12 minutes of the game, USC coughed up the ball 8 times. They looked listless on offense and failed to create high-quality looks. 
That all changed following a corner 3-pointer from freshman guard Oziyah Sellers, which sparked a 15-2 USC run to close out the half. The Trojans took a 29-20 lead at halftime, holding the Sun Devils to 22.6% from the field and 3-14 from beyond the arc. 
Ellis and freshman guard Tre White would lead the way in the second half for the Trojans. White scored an efficient 13 points on 5-7 from the field, weaving through screens and Sun Devil defenders to create open midrange shots.
The Trojans’ defense also clamped down, forcing turnovers and blocking shots as the USC lead ballooned to 14 with 6:23 left to go. 
USC was missing freshman forward Vincent Iwuchukwu and, to make matters worse, redshirt junior center Joshua Morgan was in foul trouble throughout the game. This meant that the Trojans had to heavily rely upon freshman forward Kijani Wright and sophomore forward Harrison Hornery to play in the interior. 
Wright particularly stood out, finishing the night with 7 rebounds, 2 blocks and a steal. In a game-defining play, Wright turned the ball over but recovered, sprinting back on defense to successfully defend a 3-on-1 fastbreak. He then nabbed the rebound and outletted it out, ending with an Ellis 3-pointer. 
But just as it looked as if USC was going to close out the regular season finale with an easy win, it seemed they reverted back to their first-half issues, turning over the ball and letting the Sun Devils get in the paint.
“[We always] make it interesting at the end, every game we play with Arizona State is close,” Enfield said with a smile.  
USC allowed Arizona State to crawl back into the game, and a 3-pointer by sophomore guard Frankie Collins put the Sun Devils within 2 points with a minute left. 
It was a game of free throws after that, but after Morgan missed his second free throw that would have sealed the game with six seconds left, Arizona State was left with with one last opportunity to tie the game. 
Arizona State junior guard DJ Horne would step back for a game-tying 3-pointer that would bounce off the front iron and the Trojans hung on for the win.
USC will have some time off before the Pac-12 tournament, allowing Peterson to recuperate. They’ll need him as the Trojans look to make a run in both the Pac-12 Tournament and the NCAA tournament. But, for now, Peterson just wants to soak in his final days as a member of the basketball team. 
“I love USC. It’s been an awesome few years and being a part of building this program, just leaving my mark,” Peterson said. “It’s been a great culture the last three years, and hopefully, there’s a lot more to come to USC, but we left it in a good direction.”
With this win, USC now sits (somewhat) comfortably on the right side of the NCAA tournament line. The Trojans finished the year third in the Pac-12 and will play in the Pac-12 Tournament quarterfinals Thursday night against the winner of Oregon State’s matchup with Arizona State.

Nearly a year after its launch, Sidechat remains a hub for USC gossip and happenings around campus, but some students are beginning to question the platform’s morality, as it facilitates a warzone of Greek life banter.
Sidechat is a Reddit-like social media platform that allows students from participating universities to access a private community forum for their school. All users are anonymous and can post discussion threads, text and images without identifying themselves.
Under the guise of anonymity, students are free to post whatever they want with no threat of consequence. While the platform aims to promote lighthearted discussion and community bonding, discussions can border on harassment, according to Lindsey Walton, a freshman majoring in business administration.
“If you’re looking for a new and creative form of self-harm try dating a Lambda,” one post read, followed by “They will Fowell [sic] you (probably bc they could do better).” Then another user replied “(Probably bc y’all like boys)” before slewing additional homophobic remarks at the original poster.
Sidechat’s motto of anonymity extends to the company’s communication. The creators and origin of the app are unknown and they declined the Daily Trojan’s request for comment. The company offers limited information on its website except for a short list of community guidelines and legal information. The homepage reads a single phrase: “Your college’s private community.”
Among university news, memes and reported party fouls, the most popular topic of discussion on the USC page surrounds fraternities and sororities. Walton, a member of the Gamma Phi Beta sorority, said while it was initially funny, the Greek slander is repetitive and uninspired.
“I know everybody has their individual opinions about Greek life, but the teasing on Sidechat can sometimes be a bit offensive,” Walton said. “I know my sorority has specifically been teased — all sororities have been teased, same with the frats — but when it is constantly jokes about sororities and fraternities, it gets a little bit annoying.”
Sidechat’s community guidelines prohibit anything that can be interpreted as bullying or harassment towards individuals or groups. The app also forbids trolling and any content that instigates fighting. The posts allowed on the USC page are seemingly inconsistent with this policy.
The app also protects identities by removing posts that call out specific individuals. While targeting groups is prohibited according to its guidelines, fraternity and sorority posts usually stay up.
“[Sigma Nu] tonight,” one post read, pointing to a picture of Bill Cosby. Commenters defended the fraternity, accusing other Greek organizations of sexual assault.
Walton said she believes rumors spread through Sidechat affected sorority retention rates. Pledge classes have continued to shrink significantly, Walton said, due to the Greek ranking system and pressure to join a top sorority — an issue heightened by rumors spread on Sidechat.
“Everyone in the rush process made it very clear not to get your information from Sidechat,” Walton said. “The rush process is supposed to fit you with a sorority … and when you’re getting influenced by other people’s opinions of, ‘I don’t like this sorority,’ or, ‘I don’t like that sorority,’ you might become disheartened by personal opinions and drop them or rank them lower.”
Daniel Stone, a freshman majoring in business administration, thinks Sidechat is relatively harmless. He said students should maintain a sense of humor and remember not to take posts seriously.
“Sidechat has really strict guidelines surrounding name-dropping on their platform, which makes it really hard to [target someone]” Stone said. “It’s never explicitly attacking one person in particular … We’re all mature enough to know it’s just teasing and not making fun of each other.”
Sidechat, Stone said, could serve as a tool instead of a weapon. While many posts involve lighthearted teasing, others involve asking questions, offering advice and informing students about current events and campus-related issues.
Ally Kustera, a freshman majoring in game design, said Sidechat brings the community closer by drawing attention to issues at USC and creating a sense of self-awareness through humor.
“It makes light of some unfortunate situations like Shryft, scooters and money issues,” Kustera said. “It shows all the different types of people that go to USC and how we’re viewed as this ‘University of Spoiled Children’ … like [a picture of] a girl dripped out in full Louis Vouitton in class. People make fun of that. There is clearly a sense of self-awareness.”
Stone said Sidechat can continue to be a resource for students as a place to seek advice or offer a few quick laughs, so long as people take them with a grain of salt.
“It’s kind of like the little inside jokes about USC or puns about things that are happening on campus that students want to make fun of,” Stone said. “It’s a fun way to find avenues of humor.”
The USC Panhellenic Council, Lambda Chi Alpha and Sigma Nu did not answer the Daily Trojan’s request for comment in time for publication. University Park Interfraternity Council President Carter McCarroll said that while the organization recognized the value in a platform such as Sidechat, it makes it easy for users to talk negatively about others. 
“UPIFC believes in allowing all USC students to freely express their opinion,” said McCarrol in a statement to the Daily Trojan. “Unfortunately, we’ve recognized that the price of anonymity is that some will use it to post in an effort to belittle or denigrate others or organizations.”

The advent of recent breakthroughs in artificial intelligence has wrought unforeseen consequences for USC faculty. Students across the country have already begun using ChatGPT, a language artificial intelligence model, to complete their assignments, creating challenges for professors to adapt their classes.
In an update to the University’s academic guidelines Tuesday, the Academic Senate Committee on Information Services advised professors to either “embrace and enhance” their curriculum with the software, or “discourage and detect” students using it in lieu of submitting original work. 
“Many of the proven teaching and assessment techniques that worked in a pre-generative AI world still work in a world where any student … can create walls of academic text,” the CIS guidelines read, offering examples of assignments incorporating ChatGPT and discussing the strengths and flaws of generated-text detectors available online.
Mark Marino, a professor of writing at the Dornsife College of Letters, Arts and Sciences, is one of the professors leading the charge to incorporate ChatGPT into their curriculum. Marino uses ChatGPT to help students realize what the language model lacks, and builds writing prompts around what the limits of artificial intelligence are with the intent of developing his students’ critical thinking.
“It worked well, because [while] they were impressed at first with the surface-level abilities of ChatGPT, it helped them to realize what they bring to the table,” Marino said. “If I can help students to get ChatGPT to produce something that is interesting and really well written, at the end of the day, I’ve actually taught them quite a bit about writing.”
Marino said he was motivated to implement artificial intelligence in the classroom because he foresaw the ubiquity of the tool, and thought it would be an “interesting and effective” way to extend the learning that students were working on within the classroom rather than using the tool as a crutch. He said he felt trying to prohibit the tool completely would introduce unnecessary complications and would inhibit the learning process.
“As soon as any teacher gets sucked into that cat-and-mouse game … at a university level, I feel like they’re aiming in the wrong direction. It’s not winnable,” Marino said. “GPT-4 [a new OpenAI product set to release this year] comes out before the end of the year, and all the ways of catching students are going to be invalid.”
Fabrizio Marsano, a freshman majoring in computer science games, said he believes that artificial intelligence is, at the moment, clearly identifiable due to language models being in the early stages of development.
“Maybe later on, as it gets more advanced, I think they should certainly implement stricter anti-AI plagiarism rules, because it definitely will get more realistic and it definitely [will] be important to notice as time goes by,” Marsano said.
The use of artificial intelligence in academic spaces has risen dramatically since advanced language models like GPT-3 have been made more accessible. According to a study done in November 2022 by Intelligent, an organization that helps students develop study methods, 76% of college students in the United States said ChatGPT was “very” or “somewhat” popular. The same study found that three in four college students believe it is cheating, yet continue to use the tool regardless.
Yebon Lee, a freshman majoring in neuroscience, said she believes that the use of artificial intelligence in academic spaces will not help students adequately prepare for their careers and progress intellectually because of their dependence on such tools. 
“I know a lot of students who use AI for essays and math and later on they’re complaining about how they don’t know anything, and they blame their professors,” Lee said. “In reality, it’s just them not using their time and effort and instead relying on AI.”
If professors decide to discourage students from using artificial intelligence, then they must explicitly state the restriction in the syllabus for the course, according to the guidelines. The document also includes solution suggestions for professors, such as asking more nuanced questions in assignments and requiring students to complete assignments during class, among other things.
Michelle Lee, an exploratory freshman, said two of her professors are already cracking down on the use of AI in their classrooms. 
“Whenever it’s talked about in class, it’s never a good reason,” Lee said. “[They say] don’t use ChatGPT [and say] we will catch you somehow.”
Marsano’s professors, on the other hand, have not yet discussed the issue. 
“Most of my classes now are either not related to technology and if they are, AI is not the focus,” Marsano said.
OpenAI, the developers behind ChatGPT, recently released an AI classifier to determine whether a body of text was written by artificial intelligence or not. They advise the users of the classifier to take the judgment with a grain of salt, citing how it has classified human-written texts as artificial intelligence with full confidence and how it has a hard time with any body of text.
At the moment, the decision to embrace or reject artificial intelligence tools in classes ultimately rests in the hands of each professor. While some attempt to inhibit it, there are real strides in implementing them into the curriculum across the University without the fear of having to one day “[make] dinner for our robot overlords,” Marino said.
