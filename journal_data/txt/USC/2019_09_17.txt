When you hear the word “gamer,” what do you think? You probably envision a teenage boy, controller in hand, screaming at the TV for hours on end. You might think that playing video games is a waste of valuable time that would be better spent learning new skills, building friendships or participating in friendly competition. The irony is that video games teach all those skills and many more.
There’s a stigma surrounding gamers. During the rapid development and popularization of video games over the past two decades, the term has begun to carry a less than desirable — and frankly, inaccurate — connotation.
Lazy. Outcast. Loser. After all, gamers are just clicking buttons, staring at a screen alone for hours. They don’t do anything productive, don’t have any friends and will definitely never succeed. Wrong.
It is important to know that most video games are not just about driving cars, blowing things up and shooting people. Video games teach valuable lessons to people of all ages. 
For example, take Portal, a first-person problem-solving game with a thrilling storyline. Games like Portal exercise the mind against a problem, similar to a maze or jigsaw puzzle. 
Hearthstone, a turn-based card video game, has the “high-intelligence” elements of chess: thinking ahead, strategizing and minimizing damage. 
Competitive titles like Counter-Strike: Global Offensive and Overwatch encourage teamwork, strategy and mastery of technique. Those skills seem isolated in those games, but they are not in the slightest. 
Our society encourages youth to get active in sports. Aside from keeping them active, sports teach kids valuable life lessons, including social skills, teamwork, dedication to self-improvement and mastery of a skill.
It is time to break the stigma surrounding gamers and realize that the same lessons can be taught through video games. By no means should kids stop playing physical sports, but we shouldn’t look to traditional sports as the only way to learn these lessons.
Like traditional sports, online multiplayer games foster and maintain friendships. They teach players to work together for the common good, encourage each other and build social confidence.
In today’s age, video games provide a platform on which multiple people can play together at any time from anywhere. If friends move apart, video games provide a reliable way for them to keep in touch and continue doing what they love together. 
With games that allow you to play with people around the world, the opportunity to meet new people from diverse backgrounds is more accessible than ever. I have connected with people from all over, some of whom I remain in contact with even though I no longer play the same game.
Whether in sports, competition or life, losing sucks. Human nature compels us to better ourselves, to outperform ourselves and those around us. Competitive video games, like traditional sports, take dedication and years of practice to perfect. For growing youth, perfecting a curveball or learning to hit a trickshot in a video game is not about the actual skill — it’s about the process.
The vast majority of little leaguers will not become professional baseball players, and the majority of kids playing video games will not become professional e-athletes. It is imperative that kids learn to reach a goal through self-improvement, regardless of what form of game teaches them that lesson. Video games provide that opportunity.
Our society encourages participation in sports because it recognizes the multitude of benefits they provide people of all ages. Video games seem like they have been around for ages, but the reality is that they are still in their infancy. Because of that, the majority of people don’t fully understand the benefits of video games. Rather than prejudicially writing video games off as a waste of time, take time to understand the role these games can play in society.
We should not discourage kids or adults from playing video games. By reinforcing the stigma that people who frequently play video games are wasting their time, we are shaming people for exercising their minds while challenging and bettering themselves.

After winning the Trojan Invitational last weekend, the USC women’s volleyball team will head south to the University of San Diego Invitational No. 2 Thursday and Friday.
The team is hoping for another sweep this weekend against non-conference teams as it will play 4-4 University of San Diego and 3-6 Long Beach State. 
Some of USC’s veteran players could make their return this weekend. Senior outside hitter Khalia Lanier tried to come back after being cleared for her concussion this weekend but got sick during a match. Senior opposite hitter Emily Baptista is still not back from her knee injury. 
Although USC hasn’t been at full strength recently, other players have stepped in to fill key roles. Senior middle blocker Jasmine Gross had an exceptional performance over the weekend and received Pac-12 Defensive Player of the Week honors. Meanwhile, freshman outside hitter Kalen Owes was named Pac-12 Freshman of the Week. 
To win this week, it will be imperative for all the players to keep stepping up as they have been with the changing lineups. 
Head coach Brent Crouch said he has a good feeling about the team this year but acknowledged that this tournament will be difficult.
“Lanier’s missed a lot of time,” Crouch said. “We haven’t won all the matches where people were out, but we were competitive against really good teams, and that’s great.”
USD almost collected a sweep this weekend on the road, and it figures to bring plenty of confidence to the invitational against USC and CSULB. The Trojans have kept their errors under control, but USD has not been able to do the same, committing 149 errors this season. The Trojans will need to contain their own errors and take advantage of their opponents’ mistakes. 	
The Trojans will also need a stingy defense against a USD offense that already has 418 kills and 36 aces this season. 
CSULB is also a strong offensive team, with seven players who already have at least 20 kills this season. The Trojans won’t be able to take the Beach lightly, despite its unimpressive record.
Long Beach struggles with ball handling and block errors, which is a huge advantage for the Trojans offensively. It is important for the Trojans not to get too comfortable in non-conference contests, especially after the success of the past weekend. Both opposing teams have plenty of extremely versatile players that could pose as threats to USC.
“There’s not a team we’ve played this year that I don’t think could beat us,” Crouch said. “If they are on fire, and they are playing well, and we lose a little focus or just don’t execute as well as we can, there is nobody that can’t beat us — and kind of vice versa.” 
USC cannot make the same mistakes it has in previous road tournaments, such as making too many errors. It’s important for the Trojans to stay focused and engaged in the games and learn through the previous road mistakes to ensure two wins this weekend. 
“Our team, because there are so many perfectionists, [is] learning how to work through mistakes when they happen because they are going to happen every game, every match at every level,” Crouch said. “Learning how to be OK with those and connecting and coming together — that is something we’ve been working on the last week.”

The mantra “so what, now what?” for this year’s USC football team is continually proving its relevance. It started with high expectations of a very talented roster after a disappointing 2018 season. Then, sophomore starting quarterback JT Daniels went down for the season in the first game of what was supposed to be his breakout year. The Trojans stayed resilient, though and finished victorious.
Next came the Stanford game and an early 17-3 deficit. So what? Led by a brilliant performance from standout true freshman quarterback Kedon Slovis, USC scored on six of its final seven drives and won 45-20 — dominating as an underdog.
The loss to BYU this past Saturday stung. USC came into the weekend ranked in the Top 25 for the first time since Week 2 of last season only to fall right back out.
Through all the adversity, however, no obstacle looms larger than a Friday Pac-12 South showdown vs. Utah, a red-hot team ranked No. 10 in the country after breezing to a 3-0 start. 
This unit will be tested now more than ever coming off of a heartbreaker in Provo. Redshirt senior inside linebacker John Houston Jr. is ready to answer the call in a must-win game. 
“Everybody has got to trust in our players, just trust what we can do, and trust our athletic ability,” he said after practice Tuesday. “[It’s a] short week, so we’ve got to come out and make sure we play disciplined and do our job.”
Sophomore defensive lineman Brandon Pili is ready for the challenge amidst USC’s many doubters. 
“I love it when people talk trash,” he said. “That makes me want to go harder, it makes me want to be better … This is definitely — if not the biggest, one of the biggest games of our season and I think how we respond from that loss is going to determine what kind of team we’ll be this season.”
Short week, tall task
USC’s defense struggled to stop BYU sophomore quarterback Zach Wilson from making plays with his feet. Facing another mobile quarterback in Utah senior Tyler Huntley, it has to do a better job of getting pressure and finishing tackles — which is difficult to do against an offensive line that’s yet to give up a sack all season. 
“We’ve been working tackling drills in practice, so that’s how we’ll get him down,” freshman defensive lineman Drake Jackson said. “Shortened stride, widen your base, just like that.”
Huntley isn’t the only handful on the Utah offense. His partner in the backfield, senior running back Zack Moss, has been torching defenses this season, averaging 6.5 yards per carry. 
In spite of the pair’s success, Houston emphasized that the opponent doesn’t matter — what matters is how USC performs. 
“Preparation is the same every week,” he said. “Everybody has to come out and have a strong Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday because that’s how you win the game. We’re just trying to do our job and stay disciplined to our technique and our cause.”
Freshman cornerback Chris Steele has seen his reps continually increase, and that trend is likely to continue after two tackles and a pass deflection against BYU. Getting to play a significant role as a true freshman, Steele is still adjusting to the college game.
“I’ve never played in an environment that big,” he said, noting that in practice he’s been trying to “compete against [the scout team] like I’m going up against Utah’s top receiver.”
Steele said he is “not used to losing,” so the BYU game will serve as a chip on his shoulder going into this week’s test. 
“We came back in on Sunday and really got to work, so everybody was focused, and there wasn’t too much goofing around, you know — everybody just seems locked in,” Steele said.
Friday’s outcome will seriously affect the trajectory of the Trojans’ season, and losing would certainly add fuel to the fire surrounding head coach Clay Helton’s job security. A win and the squad will be riding high with momentum going into the thick of its very difficult schedule. However, a loss could provide a huge blow after a hot start to the season led many to believe the mighty Trojans were finally back.

There is no shame in admitting that some of us drink wine for the aesthetics. It wouldn’t be the first time someone daydreams of standing on the rooftop with a glass of red wine in hand overlooking the city’s skyline. Can’t you just imagine that Instagram-worthy shot? One of the great things about wine is that it can transform your Instagram game. Here are some of the most Instagrammable wines that not only look fabulous but also taste delicious:
Usual Wines
Enriched with a satisfying sip of bing cherries, dark chocolate and fresh violets, the red wine from Usual Wines is a total game-changer for photography enthusiasts. The red wine hails from California’s very own Sonoma County and comes bottled in a cone-shaped glass that resembles the equipment of a sophisticated scientist. It’s modern and chic, two things everyone wants in an Instagram photo. Not only is it pleasing to look at, but with just the first sip you can feel the mystery of a solitary walk in the hills without the discomfort of being lost. In that sense, it’s an approachable wine. It’s sold online in packs, but they sell by the glass exclusively at the Hi-Lo Liquor Market in Culver City for $7 — and if reds are not your cup of tea, they also offer rosé and brut. 
The Marigny’s 2018 Carbonic Pinot Gris
Often referred to as ‘‘the orange wine from Oregon,’’ this is perhaps the most hip wine in Los Angeles (for the record, orange wine is not an actual term — it just refers to the color of the wine). A skin-contact pinot grigio sourced from the Willamette Valley in Oregon, the wine enchants its drinker with an experience of sun-toasted herbs and sour green olives mixed with a refreshing hint of grapefruit (ideally served slightly chilled). Just in time for the arrival of autumn, the color and shape of the wine will fit into any Thanksgiving table or picnic in a bed of fallen yellow-orange leaves. This is a wine you don’t want to miss out on, so snag a bottle while you can. It costs $32 per bottle at Hi-Lo Liquor Market.
2018 Paper Planes “Flight School” — Rosé
Rosé in a can? Yes, that’s a thing, and it is a revolutionary experience for wine drinkers. Enclosed in a 250mL can, this Russian Valley’s rosé from Sonoma County is for the casual, laidback crowd. Aesthetically pleasing with millennial pink wrapping and confetti printed around the can, this rosé is meant to be shared and is ideal for group photos at any party. Grown in a cooler climate than most rosé in California, this wine tastes crisp with a mixture of strawberries and watermelons that brings the tropical vibes to L.A. Perhaps an even better connection to the city is that Paper Planes co-founders Laura and Kyle Gabriel left careers in film and music in L.A. to launch it. It costs $8 per can at Hi-Lo Liquor Market.
May these wines help you on the first few steps toward becoming a more sophisticated Instagram influencer. Pink, red, white, yellow, orange – whatever your theme might be, there is most likely a wine that will suit your Instagram aesthetic. Next time you drink wine, be sure to snap a photo and share the experience.

USC defended its admissions processes nearly one month after a parent involved in the Operation Varsity Blues scandal subpoenaed USC for records related to the University’s admissions practice of flagging applicants as “VIP” and “special interest.” According to Monday’s court filing, USC maintains that the documents requested are difficult to present and have little relevance to the case.
According to Boston Federal Court records filed Thursday, Robert Zangrillo paid $200,000 to William “Rick” Singer, a Newport Beach-based businessman who co-founded The Edge College & Career Network, a for-profit business accused of running the college admissions scam. Singer plead guilty to all charges in March.
Records indicate that Zangrillo paid $50,000 to an account controlled by former USC Athletics administrator Donna Heinel to secure his daughter’s acceptance to the University. Zangrillo argues that his payment to the University was not a bribe, but a legally permissible donation. 
In August, Zangrillo subpoenaed USC for all records related to “special interest” applicants, a database of applicants whose families donated over $50,000, the names of University personnel responsible for such designations, the amount of money donated by flagged applicants, and any emails, texts and messages that involve his daughter. USC asked the judge to quash the subpoena.
“We recognize the seriousness of the charges against Mr. Zangrillo and will continue to fully cooperate,” the University wrote in a statement to the Daily Trojan. “We expect the court will appreciate the importance of our obligation to protect students’ privacy rights, and will strike Mr. Zangrillo’s overly broad request.”
According to the motion, flagging “VIP” or “special” applicants is a common practice at universities nationwide, and USC has no official documentation or procedure regarding the practice. Dean of Admissions Timothy Brunold defended USC’s practices and maintains the office’s innocence against Zangrillo’s allegations and requests.
“USC does not possess any documents containing a complete list of students who received a special interest tag,” Brunold said.
The motion filed in court argues that this is not true, alleging USC maintained lists of students who received special interest tags and kept a “university-wide VIP spreadsheet” with lists of students whose families donated substantial amounts of money to the university.
However, Brunold said in the filed court documents that the documents referenced by Zangrillo were kept by Heinel, and that the Office of Admission does not keep any “comparable” document listing flagged students, their family’s donations and the reason for their being flagged.
Zangrillo and his legal team oppose these claims, arguing that Brunold’s acknowledgment of the spreadsheet in email correspondence from 2016 obtained by the court. In a March 10 email, Brunold wrote in reference to cross-checking applicants to a docket spreadsheet. He claims he was referring to a spreadsheet that could be created.
Zangrillo claims that these new defenses from the University are insufficient and that the court should deny USC’s motion to quash the subpoena. 
“In short, there is ‘reason to believe’ responsive documents exist and such indefinite and unsupported conclusions are no substitute for a university having its IT department search its servers – something done every day in corporate civil litigation or while responding to government subpoenas – to provide the Court with certitude that documents … either in fact exist or a certification that they do not,” Zangrillo wrote.

No. 3 USC women’s soccer narrowly defeated Seattle University 3-2 in overtime Friday night, extending the team’s record-breaking win streak to seven games. 	
The Trojans got off to their usual fast start, as junior forward Tara McKeown found sophomore forward Penelope Hocking in the 23rd minute for Hocking’s sixth goal of the season. McKeown and Hocking have been stellar as a duo throughout the non-conference play.
USC’s lead did not last long, as Seattle equalized in the 32nd minute with a header goal by redshirt senior defender Olivia Ovenell off a free kick from 40 yards out. This was the first goal conceded by the Trojan defense in the last 249 minutes of play.
Just seconds before halftime, redshirt senior utility Natalie Jacobs found the back of the net on a deflection, and the Trojans were back on top at the break. USC has scored multiple goals in every game this season, so this match was no different.
The Trojans outshot the Redhawks 11 to 4 in the second half, but Seattle was able to capitalize in the 84th minute as junior forward Leahi Manthei took advantage of a loose ball to tie the game at 2 goals each.
Seattle was able to force overtime, and USC head coach Keidane McAlpine said that was impressed by the Redhawks’ performance.
“Tonight was a tough one in many ways,” McAlpine said in an interview with USC Athletics. “I thought Seattle did a great job in the game tonight.” 
The Trojans entered overtime with experience under their belt from earlier this season when they played past 90 minutes against then-No. 1 Florida State and came out on top.
Extra time was short-lived as junior midfielder Arlie Jones finished a second-chance opportunity outside the 6-yard box in the 93rd minute. The game-winner was Jones’ second goal this season, adding her to the list of four USC players with 2 or more goals so far this season.
The Trojans maintained their perfect record, although the game was not a pretty one.
“[It was] not our best performance, but we found a way to win,” McAlpine said.
McAlpine also spoke of the importance of winning games on nights where not everything is clicking for the team.
“Our team grew up a little bit today because we were tested, and we were pushed in ways that we needed and we are going to need moving forward,” McAlpine said. “We found a way to win on a day where we didn’t play our best, and that’s what it’s all about. If you want to do great things later, you have to be able to find ways to do this.”
The Trojans improved to a 7-0 record on the season, while the Redhawks dropped to 3-3-1.
USC will have a full week of practice before hitting the road Friday to face Baylor. The game will be the Trojans’ last non-conference outing before Pac-12 play begins against No. 2 Stanford.

The USC men’s water polo team won three of four games at the Inland Empire Classic this weekend. The tournament was the Trojans’ first regular season matches of the 2019 campaign and took place in Claremont and La Verne, Calif. 
The tournament also marked the beginning of Marko Pintaric’s career as USC’s interim head coach. Pintaric is no stranger to USC, however. He begins his new role after 18 years on the coaching staff for both the men’s and women’s teams. 
“This was the first weekend of serious games that we had — alumni games were just a test,” Pintaric said. “So we’re incorporating [players from the national team] a little bit and training with them.”
The Trojans played their first game of the season in game one of a Saturday doubleheader against the Claremont-Mudd-Scripps Stags. USC rolled to a 21-9 victory, with senior driver Marin Dasic scoring a team high 4 goals. Last season’s NCAA Tournament MVP was not far beyond, as junior driver Jacob Mercep scored 3 goals in the season-opening win.
USC took on another unranked team Saturday in the Whittier Poets in what turned out to be a much closer contest than anticipated. In a 15-9 victory, junior goalie Vaios Vlahotasios helped prevent an upset by collecting 10 saves. Freshman Chris Sturtevant scored a game high 3 goals to lead USC’s offensive charge.
The Trojans then traveled to La Verne Sunday to take part in another doubleheader. The team faced its toughest opponent yet, taking on No. 4 UC Santa Barbara. In a back-and-forth affair, the Trojans could not overcome a 4-goal deficit in the fourth quarter, eventually losing to the Gauchos 13-9. 
This was USC’s first loss against the Gauchos since 1990. It had won 55 consecutive games against UCSB before Sunday’s defeat. 
“You’re not going to win that many games if you don’t play well on defense,” Pintaric said. “When you try to score on your opponent but give up that many [goals] it becomes tough.”
Gauchos junior goalie Tiago Bonchristiano was instrumental in helping UCSB emerge victorious. With a total of 10 saves, Bonchristiano prevented the Trojans from starting their season 3-0. 
This was the Trojans’ first loss since their 7-4 defeat against UCLA in November of last season. 
The Trojans proved their ability to put a loss in the rearview mirror by blowing out the Concordia Eagles 27-3. In USC’s final game of the Inland Empire Classic, the Trojans demonstrated why they were ranked No. 1 coming into the season. 
“I think the team responded well to the loss,” Pintaric said. “They’re taking one game at a time, and against Concordia, our defense was phenomenal.”
Fifteen Trojans scored at least 1 goal in their win against the Eagles, with nine players tallying multiple scores — including Mercep, who matched his career high with 5 goals in a single match. Vlahotasios saved five shots over three periods, while sophomore goalie Jere Ashby collected five saves in the fourth period alone.
Redshirt freshman driver Bennett Winther provided a memorable highlight by scoring his first career goal, contributing to the team’s third win of the early season.
“It’s a work in progress,” Pintaric said of the team’s performance. “This was our first field tournament where the guys all played well offensively and played good games. We scored our goals but defensively we did not play up to our potential … for that reason, we paid the price against [UC Santa Barbara].”
Though the Trojans didn’t go undefeated on the weekend, the team showed that its championship run last year was no fluke. With a total of 72 goals over four games in the Inland Empire Classic, USC is proving that it is still the team to beat this year. 
The Trojans will play their first home match of the season at Uytengsu Aquatics Center Thursday when they take on Long Beach State at 5 p.m.

Undergraduate Student Government has begun providing free HIV testing through a USC Student Health program that aims to combat financial barriers to safe testing and decrease stigmas surrounding sexual health.
The program, funded through a grant provided by USG, started at the beginning of the semester and covers any out-of-pocket costs for testing that are not often covered by many health insurance plans. 
Chief Student Health Officer Sarah Van Orman said most insurance plans cover one annual screening. But further testing, which might be required due to exposure to a disease or the discovery of symptoms of a contracted infection, are often charged to the patient. 
“What we hope to do is address that gap between what’s already covered for students under their clinical preventive service benefit and then what they might run into when they’re out of pocket,” Van Orman said.
Individuals who cannot afford frequent testing risk not diagnosing a sexually-transmitted infection, Van Orman said. According to USG, the grant could also combat this aspect of HIV testing costs.
“The program expansion has the potential to particularly improve the health of students in high-risk categories and those on pre-exposure prophylaxis, or PrEP,” the letter read. “Individuals in these populations are required to undergo more frequent HIV testing, which is not always covered by insurance.”
Discussions between members from USG and Student Health for this initiative began at the start of Spring 2019, USG President Trenton Stone said. According to the letter, only about 7% of students on campus have been screened for HIV compared to the national statistic of 16%. 
According to the letter, the CDC recommends that individuals are tested at least once in their lifetime. 
The two groups developed this program to combat certain factors that affect USC’s screening percentage, including limited access. According to the letter, some students travel to the LGBT Center in Hollywood to receive free testing, which might not always be a financially viable option. Transportation can be a financial disincentive that might further discourage individuals from getting the tests they need.
There are also stigmas surrounding sexual health and testing that might discourage students from receiving adequate testing or getting tested in the first place, Stone said.
Stone, a junior majoring in philosophy and international relations (global business), hopes the initiative can normalize STI testing on campus and increase the number of students who seek testing at the University.
According to Stone and USG Vice President Mahin Tahsin, the grant will only last for this school year since the program was developed as a pilot to see how the initiative will affect the on-campus testing rate. Student Health hopes to absorb the costs of the program to make free HIV testing a permanent service if the pilot is successful.
Tahsin, a senior majoring in business administration and economics, says a lot of students understand the importance of access to STD testing, especially at University health centers.
Van Orman said access to proper health care affects the rates at which different groups receive testing. Low-income neighborhoods or communities that uphold negative stigmas around testing tend to have higher rates of a condition, she said.
Students who would like to schedule HIV testing or other STI screening can schedule an appointment with USC Student Health on the MySHR portal or at (213) 740-WELL.
According to Van Orman, students can also fill out an online form on the MySHR portal that bypasses the need to go to a health center to schedule an appointment. A nurse will screen the form and place an order for the desired test. Then students can simply visit the testing lab and go through the screening process.

No player in the NFL has received more attention in 2019 than Antonio Brown and rightfully so.
Over the past six months, the star wide receiver’s actions have dominated much of the NFL’s news cycle. Some would dub them “antics” or “turbulent behavior,” and they wouldn’t be wrong. Brown has been no stranger to controversy during his time in the NFL, but this year feels different.
From his unorthodox haircuts to his on-field emotion to his jaw-dropping talent, Brown has remained a beloved, if polarizing, figure for most of his career. As a Pittsburgh Steeler, he picked up the torch from receiving royalty like Santonio Holmes and Mike Wallace and ran with it, reaching the Pro Bowl in seven out of his nine years with the team. 
Sure, he butted heads with a Super Bowl-winning coach and quarterback sometimes, but one of those people is Ben Roethlisberger, who is difficult to get along with himself! Brown’s an emotional guy, and Pittsburgh isn’t a place that deals well with that. Conflict makes sense — that’s why it didn’t feel like news earlier this year when we found out there was a real disconnect between Brown and the organization. It’s the situation, duh!
Oh, but it wasn’t. Brown’s recent domination of sports headlines began in December, when his tension with the Steelers boiled over. He refused to suit up for the pivotal regular season finale against the Cincinnati Bengals. It was a bad look. Pittsburgh didn’t make the playoffs, and Brown was traded in March to the Oakland Raiders. 
The Raiders offered Brown a three-year contract worth over $50 million with $30 million in guaranteed money, a payoff Brown had sought despite becoming the league’s highest paid receiver in 2017. Brown seemed content. After all, as he likes to say, business was boomin’. 
But then he showed up to training camp with frostbitten feet. Weird, but okay. Then he flat-out refused to play without his specific model of helmet, which had become outdated according to a rule that every other player seemed to accept in stride. That was weirder. He followed that up with some questionable social media posts, one referencing a fine the team gave him and one that included a recording of a phone call with Raiders head coach Jon Gruden in which Gruden questioned Brown’s commitment to the team. When that didn’t go over so well, he went to the Raiders facility and delivered a fiery rant that peaked with him calling general manager Mike Mayock a cracker. What?
Whew, did I recap all of that okay? Oh wait, he also asked the team to release him via social media, and it did. He recorded his reaction to the news of his release and posted it to YouTube. Classic. Oh, and the defending Super Bowl champions signed him just hours later on a one-year, $15 million contract. Business is boomin’ again.
You’d think this would be the logical end to the Antonio Brown saga, but you’d be wrong. In fact, Brown’s string of unpredictable behavior took a sinister turn Tuesday night when The New York Times reported that Brown’s former trainer, Britney Taylor, had filed a civil lawsuit against him for sexual assault and rape. WTF?
From what’s known so far, the details of the case are both disturbing and confusing. Leaked text messages from Brown to Taylor reflect his erratic persona in the most bizarre ways possible and seem to confirm a relationship between the two. 
Brown says the relationship was consensual, and his attorneys allegedly plan to follow up with a countersuit against Taylor. Reports also surfaced Sunday that Brown rejected a $2 million settlement and maintains his innocence as the lawsuit moves to court.
In the meantime, because it’s a civil case, Brown is free to play football while the investigation continues.
We’re all asking the same question: Who the hell can get away with all of this? It’s exhausting just to summarize it — I can’t imagine being his coach. But seriously, 99% of the league would be gone after even one of Brown’s many mistakes. Is it clichéd to remind you that all Colin Kaepernick did was take a knee?
Again, there’s no denying that Brown is talented. And in this world, talented people can make the kinds of mistakes many others can’t. But how many mistakes can he make before you set him straight? It’s a pattern of behavior the NFL can’t keep allowing from whatever team is willing to rent his talents until it eventually grows tired of him.
It’s far too early to take a confident stance on this case, but it’s a horrific cap on what’s been a crippling year for Brown’s reputation. That’s a shame for a player who’s so often praised by fellow players for his passion, positivity and work ethic on the field. Now, it’s up to him to prove it off the field as much as he does on it.

The new USC Center for Sustainability Solutions is hosting an artwork competition to involve students in creating its visual identity, which will appear on all Center materials. 
The Center, which officially opens next semester, is dedicated to educating students and working with local governments, industry, NGOs and regulatory agencies on solutions to environmental issues like climate change and air pollution.
The artwork competition is open to current undergraduate and graduate students. Students, who can work individually or as teams, must submit original artwork that represents the Center and its mission. Entries are due Oct. 25 and will then be judged by a committee of students, faculty and staff who work in the Center.
Bento revealed that finalists for the competition will have an opportunity to explain their entries at a later event followed by a live vote that will decide the three semi-finalists. The top three will then be able to make adjustments to their logo based on the Center’s comments. 
The winner of the competition will receive $1,500 and their design will be used on the Center’s digital, print and physical media. From letterheads to statues, the competition’s winner will have a lasting impact on the Center’s history, according to Antoni Bento, director of the Center for Sustainability.
“The person that will end up winning this art competition … will forever be linked with our center,” Bento said. “By creating the visual identity of the Center, you’re also helping and developing the brand and developing our own identity that can be used … around the world.”
Bento wants to create a strong sense of student involvement within the Center in an effort to make the campus aware of everyone’s role in working toward sustainability. He also hopes to encourage new and creative ways to tackle these issues.
“Historically, we may have not thought a lot about [Virtual Reality] as a mechanism for creating a solution, but it turns out that the arts are incredibly important because we need new ways for communicating the challenges that we’re facing,” Bento said.
Locally, the Center hopes to follow in the footsteps of Los Angeles’s own Green New Deal, launched by Mayor Eric Garcetti in April 2019. Similarly President Carol Folt has also made sustainability a key-player in her plans for the University. However, according to center director Antonio Bento, a professor at the Sol Price School of Public Policy, plans are being made to address more global concerns.
“While our work starts here, in L.A., we also understand that USC is a global institution,” Bento said. “We are launching sustainability solution hubs around the world so that we also help [countries like Beijing, Mexico City, Soa Paulo and Delhi] tackle their challenges.”

No. 11 USC men’s golf had a solid first outing of the season at the competitive 15-team Maui Jim Invitational in Scottsdale, Ariz., this past weekend. The team shot a total of 825, tying for fifth overall behind high-seeded teams such as No. 2 ASU and No. 17 Clemson.
The Trojans collectively kept under par throughout the low field tournament, finishing with a 15-under score after consistent daily postings of 272, 274 and 279. Arizona State won the event with a 38-under 802, while Arizona and Clemson followed with 31-under and 29-under performances. 
The team’s newcomers stepped up from the start. Freshman Yuxin Lin shot a 4-under 66 in the first round, while junior transfer Leon D’Souza shot a 3-under 67. The Trojans finished seventh after the first day, with an 8-under-par performance. Even with the low finish, the Trojans couldn’t keep up with the top of the leaderboard, as ASU and Arizona ran away with 18-under and 12-under team finishes. 
D’Souza struggled in the second round, with two double bogeys that led to a 3-over 73 finish. Sophomore Charlie Reiter rallied from an early double bogey to end the day carding 1-under 69, while senior Kyle Suppa closed out the round even par with three birdies against a double bogey.
The Trojans rallied in round three from their seventh place spot following the first two rounds. With a solid 1-under-par performance on the final day, USC beat out Kent State, which shot 7-over-par in the final round. Junior Issei Tanabe gave the team a final push with a 2-under third round as a result of key birdies on the back nine. 
Lin came out on top in his collegiate debut. Tying for 12th in individual performance for the tournament, Lin shot an impressive overall 7-under with 14 birdies and an eagle on his card. For the freshman from Beijing, China, the Maui Jim Invitational marks the beginning of a promising golf career at USC.
“It’s such an honor to represent USC,” Lin said. “Especially at my first event, I just [felt] all the support and help from the coaches.”
Tanabe tied for 21st at 4-under 206 while Suppa and Reiter tied for 37th at even par 210. D’Souza finished the tournament tied for 57th at 5-over 215. Lin said the team still has room to grow in terms of shot strategy.
“Our course strategy could’ve been better for certain shots,” he said. “It’s our first event. We still need more practice to get better and be ready for the next event.”
The Maui Jim Invitational wasn’t the only source of action for the men’s golf team this weekend. Sophomore Cameron Henry and freshman Tyler Guo were also in Arizona competing at the Mea Lanakila Individual at the Desert Forest Golf Club. Henry tied for 13th, carding 5-over 221, while Guo finished 35th with a rough 21-over 91 first round and a final score of 38-over 254.
USC will send five players to Portland, Ore., in two weeks to play in the Nike Collegiate while Lin, D’Souza and Guo will head to Shanghai, China, to compete in the Asia-Pacific Amateur Championship.
While the three players heading to China won’t be representing USC, the experience playing in the amateur tournament will allow them to bolster their playing ability for later tournaments. If the Trojans hope to make podiums this season, their consistency must meet shot strategy to match the performance of the upcoming densely competitive fields.

The School of International Relations and Department of Political Science, two programs housed in the Dornsife College of Letters, Arts and Science, merged to form the Department of Political Science and International Relations this semester. The new department is chaired by professors Saori Katada and Ann Crigler. 
Dornsife Dean Amber Miller wrote in an email to faculty announcing the change that the new department is important because it will expand its expertise in areas like immigration, health care, social justice, gender and race and economic development.
“The department maintains the School of International Relations as a pillar of strength in both teaching and research in international studies, while creating closer connections to our well-established Political Science strengths in areas such as American politics, comparative politics and research methods,” she wrote.
Katada stated the merger follows other universities like Columbia, Northeastern and Rutgers that place their international relations and political science programs under the same department. 
Katada, who co-chaired the committee overseeing the change, will direct the international relations portion of the program. She said the merger will help streamline administrative work for both majors because it will allow them to work together more effectively on hiring new faculty and leading collaborative and interdisciplinary projects. This increased visibility will also help the department recruit strong faculty and students.
Miller said the change will make the new department the largest social sciences program in Dornsife with 1,150 students and 47 full-time faculty. The merger would also increase the administration’s ability to coordinate PhD students’ classes more efficiently. 
For the last 15 years, the doctoral program has already combined political science and international relations classes for its students, but “the PhD program will be enhanced by closer working relationships among faculty who continue to provide strong training in core disciplinary areas,” Miller wrote.
Katada said that undergraduate students majoring in international relations and political science will see no major changes to their curriculum. 
However, classes that follow similar topics in the international relations major and political science major may be placed in a sequence so students can take relevant classes from both departments in order.
Anushka Sapra, a junior majoring in international relations, political economy and NGOs and social change, believes that the merger is beneficial to students, since the program could benefit from more resources. She believes there won’t be too much change because both departments have similar classes. 
USC will now function similarly to other universities in the U.S. in terms of having a combined department for international relations and political science.
“[The department] was created with strong support of the majority of the faculty following extensive faculty consultation, and the recommendation of an eminent group of external reviewers in political science and international relations,” Miller wrote.

Residential Education has implemented extensive changes to this Fall’s residential curriculum. It will now create the programs hosted by resident assistants to offload the RAs’ stress of creating their own weekly events. 
“Some of the [resident assistants] would be over-programming and running the risk of not taking time for themselves to slow down and to focus on their academics, just to breathe and be a student,” said Emily Sandoval, the senior director for Residential Education. 
According to Natalia Wurst, a second-year RA at Trojan Hall, the majority of her free time during her first year as a resident assistant was used for extensive planning, coordinating and hosting events. Now, Wurst, a junior majoring in public policy and psychology, says she has a much smaller input on the programs.
“You get to pick the theme of your event — I could have done pizza instead of an ice cream social [for my event], but for the most part, the core components of the program are the same for all the RAs,” Wurst said. “I think that’s just so [Residential Education] can standardize what is being presented to residents.” 
Bulletin boards are another large responsibility that was offloaded from the residential advisors. In the previous curriculum, advisors were expected to decorate bulletin boards in their residential college under certain guidelines. 
“I know [the bulletin boards] were something that took a lot of time and I don’t really think [they were] that important,” said Maya Hildebrand, a past residential advisor at Cowlings and Ilium and a senior majoring in mechanical engineering. “I know, for example, RAs would put up bulletin boards and then they would get torn down by the end of the day.”
A primary goal of offloading programming and activities like bulletin boards was to encourage the resident assistants to have genuine and intentional interactions with their residents. 
“RAs wanted to be involved with our program because they wanted to help their fellow Trojans, one of the number one priorities for RAs becoming RAs,” said Erin Hunter, the Residential Education Associate Director for the University Park Campus.  “We were hoping that reducing the programmatic effort would allow them to have Trojan Talks with intentional interactions, relationship-building opportunities and tough conversations more frequently.”
Hunter created a committee of staff to pilot the new residential curriculum model in March 2019. Dr. Keith Edwards, a national keynote speaker on topics like sexual violence prevention, student affairs leadership and the residential experience, attended a two-day intensive training with Hunter’s staff, allowing the committee to organize its pivot to the new curriculum. 
“Dr. Keith Edwards worked really closely with us … He said to launch the curriculum at 40%,” Sandoval said. “We’re not 100 percent% done planning it out … Part of the beauty of this is that we adjust and evolve to what the residents need.”
The curriculum focuses on four goals: equity and inclusion, self-awareness, well-being and community engagement. Each goal has intended outcomes that Residential Education hopes will meaningfully contribute to global communities as a result of their residence on campus at USC, the educational priority of the new programming. 
Hildebrand said she hopes Residential Education continues making changes based on the well-being of the resident assistants, citing that tough conversations often magnified their levels of stress. 
“The biggest stress doesn’t come from the programming itself, but it comes from feeling like you are this resource for your floor, you’re this therapist for your floor, you’re also a police for your floor and all of the above,” Hildebrand said. “Another good step would be having more resources for an RA, such as a counselor at Engemann specifically for RAs to go see.”
As for Residential Education, they will continue altering the new curriculum as they receive feedback from resident assistants, residents and residential college coordinators.
“I think that no matter what a first-year student chooses to do — what academic college they are in, what student organizations they decide to join, if they’re a student-athlete or a part of student government — where their head hits the pillow has to be home,” Sandoval said. 
Residential Education encourages residents and resident assistants to submit their feedback on the residential experience in a survey that will be sent to students in October.

Leavey Library is one of the most crowded areas on campus, yet the fourth floor remains a mystery to the majority of its visitors, even within the USC community. 
USC Shoah Foundation relocated to the top floor of Leavey in late 2018.  However, its founding has a deeper history. In 1994, filmmaker Steven Spielberg founded the institute to preserve testimonies from Holocaust survivors. Now, in 2019, it is one of the largest digital collections of its kind, with over 55,000 testimonies that amount to over 115,000 hours. The Foundation has since expanded to document other genocides such as the Nanjing Massacre and the Rwandan, Armenian and Guatemalan genocides. 
The scale of its work is as impressive as it is expansive. Its core mission statement reads, “To overcome prejudice, intolerance and hatred — and the suffering they cause — through the educational use of the Institute’s Visual History Archive.” The educational component is both its vision and a promise. Among its numerous programs are IWitness, Teacher Innovation Network, Echoes & Reflections and others that reach an international audience. 
The Foundation’s global impact and outreach are at complete odds with the USC community’s indifference and ignorance of the organization. The Shoah Foundation offers student research fellowships and the Visual History Archive is free to register and use.
But all these reasons still beg the question: Why? 
Why should students and faculty, already knee-deep in work, make the time and effort to explore the Shoah Foundation? Why should the USC community watch testimonies from the Visual History Archive when current events already offer a slew of horrifying news about one mass shooting or another? Why should Trojans who don’t have familial or historical ties to these genocides hear stories of immense pain and grief from strangers?
Though it is easy to complain about the homework, jobs or other trivialities of everyday life, students should not forget that being a student at USC — or any other university — is a privilege that many cannot claim. In acknowledging this privilege, students and faculty should take it upon themselves, be that for an adjunct educational opportunity or a necessary humanity lesson, to listen to and learn from the stories of humans’ capacity for evil and their restoration of goodness through will and love.  
National and local newspapers are rife with stories of mass shootings, deaths in migration detention centers, locker-room talk in the highest levels of leadership. Watching testimonies of genocide survivors does seem like overkill — another way to burden the depressed morale of the youth and of the country at large. But while watching survivors recount stories of their trauma is difficult, these testimonies are traced with human strength and love in the face of the worst. Survivors onscreen are brave enough to share their painful pasts. Such an act is a form of activism that demands genocides are never repeated. These testimonies serve as reminders that, even in the midst of contemporary disasters and failures, truth and hope can and will persevere. 
These testimonies are difficult to empathize with, for many have not experienced the tragedy and trauma survivors have undergone. Regardless, listening without appropriation and interruption is a skill the world needs, perhaps now more than ever. The University community and the world at large need to listen to these stories — not to empathize, but to cultivate empathy. Empathy is compassion that can, from a respectful distance, grieve and celebrate the survivor’s loss and strength. That, in turn, becomes a formative perspective in which everyday trivial matters can be seen in a new light with more hope, courage and love.

Hello from your undergraduate and graduate student body presidents! We — Trenton Stone and Skye Parral — are so excited to start a new biweekly opinion column in the Daily Trojan titled “President’s Corner.” The aim of this column is simple: to inform students about resources their governments offer, describe initiatives we’re working on to improve the USC experience and highlight important topics on campus. For this first edition, we are writing a joint introductory piece to kick off this new effort. And for the following editions, the two of us will alternate in order to focus on different undergraduate and graduate subjects. 
First, we want to welcome every student to USC. Whether you’re returning for another year or it’s your first semester, we’re excited to work with you over the next year. It’s a uniquely exciting year — with a new University president, a new provost, many new vice presidents and changes in every corner of campus, we all come to USC with new hopes and ambitions for our community. As your elected representatives, we strive to make institutional improvements to the place where thousands of us work, live and study. Through understanding and collaborating, we want to strengthen the Trojan family and address issues of common concern for all students, both undergraduate and graduate. It is our hope that you feel you can reach out to us with any questions, comments or concerns you have about USC.
We recognize the difficulties faced by many students as they first come to campus, especially with everything that has happened in the past few years. To best adjust to the campus environment, we encourage you to work to find your place in the Trojan Family. Luckily, there are over 1000 student-run organizations and myriad other opportunities across campus. Research shows that the first six weeks of the semester are important for finding your social circles. Positive friendships help lessen stress and depressive symptoms, and establishing a supportive network of friends is helpful on a college campus.
As we look toward this new school year, we’d also like to introduce you to our student governments — USG and GSG — to highlight a few key goals for our administrations.
USG is composed of almost 120 student officer positions that support its daily mission through our advocacy, communications, funding, judicial, legislative and programming branches. Together, we employ a budget of nearly $2.5 million, derived from the $64 student programming fee, to enhance the USC undergraduate experience. USG’s work is wide-ranging and ever-evolving. This year, some of our priorities include increasing availability of and access to mental health resources, improving USC’s environmental sustainability, cross-campus shared governance and increasing student-focused services like free Lyft, the number of study spaces, student organization funding and resource support for first-generation and international students. 
GSG is composed of 26 students operating on a $1.6 million budget. And this year, GSG is focusing on several items. The first is increasing equitable programs and resources for the students of the Health Sciences Campus. Second, we are working with multiple campus partners on a permanent DREAM center for students. GSG is always juggling multiple projects and initiatives such as travel grants, childcare subsidies and identifying the needs of first-generation students, just to name a few.   
Together, as two student governments, we are prioritizing a few initiatives. USG and GSG are actively working to address housing and food insecurity among our students. We believe that students should be able to focus on their coursework, lab work and growing as a scholar while they are at USC.  Moreover, we aim to improve communication and shared governance between students, staff, faculty and senior administration. Separately, USG and GSG have a variety of funding options available for students to hold events and perform research. We also offer all students access to free professional legal counseling, a free annual subscription to The New York Times and free HIV testing through USC Student Health, among much more. You can check out our websites for more information at usg.usc.edu and gsg.usc.edu.
Both of us are thrilled to start this biweekly opinion column, and we look forward to sharing more information with you through this year. 
We wish you the best this semester and hope to see you around campus. Fight On!
