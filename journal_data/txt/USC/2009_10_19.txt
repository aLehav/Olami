Sophomore nose tackle Jurrell Casey was named Pac-10 defensive player of the week before practice Monday, after playing an integral role in Saturday’s win against Notre Dame and helping the nation’s top team in sacks continue its dominance on the line.
USC leads the nation with 4.33 sacks per game, and the defensive line is well ahead of coach Pete Carroll’s expectations.

“This has been the most active we have been [at defensive line] this early in the year,” Carroll said. “There are a lot of guys that have sacks, a lot of guys making plays.”
The Trojans’ production has come despite a knee injury to junior tackle Christian Tupou. He has been replaced on the line by sophomore Armond Armstead, whose natural position is at end.
“We’re missing a warrior in Tupou. Without him in there, this is the situation that’s best for the team now,” defensive line coach Jethro Franklin said. “I was glad to see Armond play so much, but he can improve on it.”
In addition to Armstead and Casey, the emergence of redshirt freshman defensive ends Nick Perry, who has eight sacks, and Wes Horton allow the Trojans to focus on other aspects on defense, despite rushing only four against the Fighting Irish Saturday.
“It’s a great benefit when you can just rush with four guys. We were able to turn our focus to other things, like [Irish wide receiver] Golden Tate,” Carroll said. “It gives you more choices”
But despite the success, there are other areas in which Franklin insists upon improvement for the unit, which also ranks second in the nation with 9.33 tackles for loss per game. Against the Irish, three separate members of Franklin’s line were flagged for personal fouls.
“We realize that we can’t play that way, to have an offsides is bad enough, but to have three guys on your unit have personal fouls, you can’t do that,” Franklin said. “You just have to keep a cool head. We learn from it, talk about it, pay the price and move on.”

Redshirt junior fullback Stanley Havili sat out of practice Monday, after he suffered a dislocated shoulder during the third quarter of the Trojan’s victory over Notre Dame Saturday.
Carroll described Havili on Monday as “sore” and said the fullback would have an MRI done Tuesday to see the extent of the damage. To Havili, however, the injury is nothing new, and nothing to be worried about.
“[The shoulder] used to come out all the time in high school, then I had surgery on it, but I’m not worried about it,” Havili said. “[In high school] I played the next game, every time.”

A picture portraying sophomore tight end Blake Ayles making obscene gestures behind fans during pregame warm ups at Notre Dame made the rounds on the Internet after being posted early Monday morning on the popular sports blog Deadspin.com.
Ayles, who has six receptions this season, was apologetic after practice Monday.
“I’m sorry to the Notre Dame team, sorry to the program. I was just caught up in the moment,” Ayles said.

The Trojans are once again preparing for Oregon State, after the Beavers handed the Trojans their only loss of last season. Preparing for running back Jaquizz Rodgers is among the priorities.
“Rodgers is the most productive runner in the history of Texas high school football,” Carroll said. “That’s kind of hard to simulate.”
“Rogers is a heck of a back; he’s Barry Sanders-ish,” Franklin added.

With the release of the first Bowl Championship Series standings, every contender in college football is plotting the complex path it would take to get to the championship game.
And the world keeps spinning.
The October release is like clockwork; a whole bunch of numbers that mean nothing to the average college football fan is thrown out to justify a new hierarchy that leaves everyone bewildered. Now, the fiercest team loyalists have to have a nationwide consciousness of the game in order to understand their team’s place in the bigger picture.
There are too many games left to be played for any fans to start worrying about their chances at this point in the season. But USC fans had to be a little bit mystified when the Trojans debuted at No. 7 in the standings, despite being ranked No. 4 in both the AP and Coaches polls.
And while there’s the expected question of what it would take to get the Trojans to the Jan. 8 game in the Rose Bowl instead of the boring Jan. 1 version that they’re accustomed to, there’s another, more interesting scenario at hand. USC’s best chance to make it to the title game would also provoke more rumblings of an uprising from schools that felt jilted by the system.
As it stands, most prognosticators are calling for Texas to play the winner of the Southeastern Conference in the title game, a clean outcome that those affiliated with the BCS would love. After so many years of bad publicity, a year without controversy would help take some of the heat off the embattled system.
Of course, you don’t really need a system to pair together two undefeated teams at the end of the year, but the powers that be would probably like to remain behind the curtain on this one.
But considering that there hasn’t been a title clash between undefeated teams since USC met Texas in the 2006 Rose Bowl, there’s always room for a little doubt. With the way the first half of the season has played out, the uncertainty would mean ugliness for college football.
Each of the three teams ahead of USC have been surprises in the early part of the season; few would have predicted Boise State, Cincinnati and Iowa to be this high in the polls at this point in the year. But all have potential pitfalls that could hurt them in the rankings.
The talk surrounding Boise State is if “the little team that could” might actually make a case for the national championship game. But with an uninspiring schedule remaining, the Broncos could get jumped repeatedly in the standings by teams who have more to offer on a weekly basis. In fact, there’s talk of TCU taking Boise State’s bid if the Horned Frogs win out, because they play against more impressive teams and in a more highly regarded conference.
Despite having the label of a major conference team, Cincinnati has been treated like a cute sideshow by most of the college football world. The Bearcats face similar challenges in perception as Boise State, though they get more respect for playing in the Big East Conference.
But even with an undefeated season Cincinnati would be impervious to being leapfrogged by one-loss teams like USC.
Iowa provides the most interesting obstacle, because the Big Ten Conference still has enough prestige behind it, despite being battered in the national spotlight repeatedly over the last three years. An unbeaten Hawkeyes team would be an attractive option if the Texas-SEC arrangement falls through. Scoreboard watchers will likely have their eyes on a Nov. 14 date with Ohio State, and USC fans will likely be asking for a favor from the team whose heart they’ve broken the last two years.
If the Texas-SEC marriage doesn’t pan out, the BCS will be forced to make an unpopular decision and pick among a horde of flawed teams. And though the system is here to stay, plenty of schools would at least temporarily make their voices heard in the campaign against the BCS.
Of course, none of this matters if USC doesn’t win out. With only Pac-10 games remaining, any slip up would cost the Trojans not only a shot at the national title game but also the conference crown.
Given that uncertainty, it’s probably best for USC fans to tune out the numbers talk for a few weeks and check back in if the Trojans are still undefeated after a Halloween game against Oregon. The final month will be more telling than any predictions available now.
And, if the system is still unintelligible to you, don’t feel bad. Number-crunchers such as Brad Edwards and Jerry Palm make careers out of interpreting the system.
Maybe USC should start offering “BCS analysis” as a major — it’s going to be needed almost every year.

After a first round elimination in their first tournament of the season, No. 3 senior Robert Farah and sophomore Steve Johnson came roaring back at the Wilson/ITA Southwest Regional Championships to take first place.
The tournament was held Oct. 15-19 in Malibu, Calif., at Pepperdine University. The USC men’s tennis team had six competitors in the singles tournament, including senior Jason McNaughton, No. 49 junior Jaak Poldma, sophomore Daniel Nguyen, sophomore Ben Lankenau, junior Daniel Gliner and freshman JT Sundling.

The Trojans also brought three doubles teams to the courts, including eventual champions Farah and Johnson, Poldma and Nguyen, and McNaughton and Sundling.
Farah and Johnson enjoyed the most success of all Trojans at the tournament with their second straight title at the tournament. As the No. 1 seed, the duo swept through competition to make it to the semifinal round on Sunday. They faced off with Pepperdine’s sophomore Hugh Clarke and freshman Finn Tearney. An 8-4 Trojan victory sent the pair to the final round, which began immediately after the conclusion of the semifinal match.
Like last year, Farah and Johnson matched up with another Pepperdine pair, sophomore Daniel Moss and freshman Sebastien Fanselow. The final match was yet another smooth victory for Farah and Johnson. An 8-3 decision gave the pair its second championship in two years at the tournament.
Pepperdine coach Adam Steinberg said Farah and Johnson were “what I consider the best doubles team in the country.”
Farah said Steinberg’s compliment was a testament to the USC pair’s stellar play.
“That’s a great compliment. That means we’re playing well, and we can play at a higher level,” Farah said. “I’m excited that he said that.”
No. 4-seeded Nguyen and Poldma reached the quarterfinal round before being eliminated. The No. 3 seed from San Diego State University ended McNaughton and Sundling’s run in the round of 32.
Farah and Johnson did not play singles after already qualifying for the ITA Indoor National Intercollegiate Tournament at the All-American Tournament a little over a week ago. Farah, who is ranked No. 3 in the nation in singles, felt playing singles at ITA Regionals would be a lose-lose situation for him.
“You’re kind of risking your ranking a little bit because you’re not playing against top players in the nation,” Farah said. “It’s a tournament where you would be completely the favorite so you don’t have anything to win and everything to lose.”
Singles competition started off promisingly with five of the six Trojans moving on after the first round of 128. The next round, however, saw an elimination for No. 9-seeded Nguyen and unranked McNaughton. The remaining three Trojans powered on, reaching the round of 32. It was there, however, that Sundling and Gliner were eliminated in two close matches.
The only remaining Trojan in the tournament was No. 5-seeded Poldma, who was defeated in the round of 16 by UCLA’s No. 9-seeded Amit Inbar in straight sets.
USC coach Peter Smith said that while the defeat was disappointing, it provides the team with valuable lessons.
“We got knocked off the pedestal a little bit there, and it just shows we need to keep working hard and just because we’re the national champions people aren’t just going to roll over for us —  they’re going to do the opposite actually,” Smith said.
A bit of misfortune in the first round allowed two Trojans to continue on in the consolation tournament. Lankenau made it to the quarterfinals before being eliminated. Nguyen had a bye in the first round of the main tournament, but lost in the second round, thus earning himself a spot in the consolation tournament as well. There, Nguyen swept through the competition, defeating every opponent in straight sets to take home the consolation championship.
“Character is built in the back draw,” Nguyen said.

Jennifer Song proved again why she is the No. 1-ranked collegiate golfer with a second straight victory at the Stanford Intercollegiate Championship over the weekend. Song’s second career individual title came thanks to her 8-under-par 205 (67-71-67) at the Stanford Golf Course in Palo Alto, Calif., giving her four rounds in the 60s in five tries this year.
“I think I played awesome,” Song said. “Even though I had a couple of double bogeys and bogeys in my second and third round, I kept thinking about the amount of birdies I could still make.”
That positive thinking led Song to the third-lowest tournament score in team history.
“I stayed patient and thought positive out there,” Song said.
Song led the No. 1 USC women’s golf team to a fifth place finish at 21-over 873 (289-295-289), 23 strokes behind No. 3 Arizona State. In a tournament where the Women of Troy were missing junior All-American Lizette Salas, the team relied on senior All-American Belen Mozo to pick up the slack.
Mozo made her season debut at the Stanford Intercollegiate after undergoing shoulder surgery over the summer, and tied for 33rd at 7-over 220 (75-70-75), good for second place on the team.
A few strokes behind Mozo were sophomore Inah Park and freshman Cyna Rodriguez, who tied for 47th at 13-over 226. Park overcame a second round 80 to shoot a 73 on the final day, despite deteriorating conditions. The first two days were sunny with good golfing conditions, but the final day had play delayed by an hour due to fog in the morning.
“It got really chilly and windy, and I think a lot of players struggled in the afternoon,” Song said.
Rodriguez was consistent over the course of the tournament, with scores of 74, 77 and 75 in the second tournament of her USC career.
Senior Caroline Kim wrapped up the Women of Troy’s roster with a tie for 60th at 17-over 230 (79-77-74), improving upon her previous score in every round.
The Women of Troy will travel to the University of North Carolina’s women’s Fall Preview this weekend in Wilmington, N.C., but will again be doing so without one All-American. Song will not be traveling with the team this week, as she is leaving this Saturday to play in the Hana Bank KOLON Championship in Incheon, South Korea.
“This is an excellent opportunity for us to get depth and get everybody into the lineup to get competitive experience,” USC coach Andrea Gaston said.
The Women of Troy will play in North Carolina from Oct. 23 to Oct. 25, then travel to Hawaii for a tournament Nov. 2 to Nov. 4, which concludes their fall season. Despite the hectic schedule, Gaston isn’t worried about fatigue or the team falling behind in school.
“They all know what’s expected, and they all enjoy the competitions,” Gaston said. “They obviously have to do the best they can to keep up.”

Whispers of excitement, sharp intakes of breath and utterances of sheer disbelief all emanate from a mesmerized crowd, collectively transported — if only for a moment — to a land not quite human, where anything is possible.
That’s the circus for you.
Trickster · Kooza, the latest show from Cirque du Soleil, features an array of performers, including tightrope walkers and contortionists. - Photos courtesy of Cirque du Soleil
Specifically, that’s Kooza, a new touring Cirque du Soleil masterpiece now running at the Santa Monica Pier in the iconic big-top tent until Nov. 28.
You can’t help but sit there, spellbound to the point of paralysis, as Kooza’s incredibly talented company of players perform unbelievable stunt after stunt, each more death-defying than the one before. The acts are at once familiar and totally unfamiliar. Most of us have seen contortionists, trapeze artists, unicyclists, tightrope walkers, jugglers, clowns and all other such manner of circus folk before — but probably not like this, with such gorgeous artistry and graceful athleticism that to witness it is but to realize the sheer awesomeness and transcendent beauty of the human form
Kooza returns us to Cirque du Soleil’s origins, doing away with the flashiness and novelty of its more recent productions in favor of time-honored circus traditions. They’ve got old-fashioned slapstick clownery and impossible feats of physicality, live music and crazy contraptions, all fighting to steal away greater portions of your imagination for two blissful hours (separated by a 30-minute intermission) of in-the-moment circus splendor.
The show opens with the Innocent (played here by a likeable Stéphan Landry, but cast members rotate), trying to fly his kite in a bare field — a sublime bit of characterization, and one of those rare moments of the ordinary made extraordinary. His graceful frolicking about the stage is interrupted by the arrival of a large package, out of which springs the Trickster, a wizard who transfigures the Innocent’s world into his own — an otherworldly realm called Kooza.
In Kooza, the Trickster is king, conjuring up misty landscapes of light and dark and playing with the Innocent’s mind. What is this place, and why is the Innocent here? Of course, this being Cirque du Soleil, we’re never given clear answers, but in the Innocent we see a child encouraged by friendship and emboldened by the marvelous to act out his own imagination. It is an adventure story, and the Holy Grail is self-discovery.
Each of the acts, it seems, are manifestations of the Innocent’s imagination, as revealed by the Trickster. One of the first acts is also one of the show’s best: a trio of female contortionists atop a rotating circular platform, bending their boneless bodies into superhuman shapes. The crowd went wild with disbelief.
Other memorable acts include a pas de deux — which is already a difficult dance — performed by an unicyclist and his female partner, and a high-wire act featuring four performers. In perhaps the night’s most heart-stopping moment, one of the tightrope walkers botched his landing trying to leap over his friend and nearly fell off the tightrope. There was a collective intake of breath before he grabbed onto the rope and swung himself back up, and performed the leap again successfully to rousing applause. Such moments of imperfection — as rare as they are frightening — get you thinking: How do I take that? Should I feel let down?
Certainly not. Those moments remind us of the incredible difficulty of these acts. A perfect show, while admirable, is far less exciting. A slight mistake or two, so long as nobody gets hurt (there are apparatuses set up to reduce that risk), rarely detract from the overall experience. Quite the contrary; they make it seem more real, and we remember that these are people doing these stunts, not — as we might sensibly think — aliens from some far-off planet unfettered by the laws of physics. Strangely, a mistake or two goes a long way in making the overall show that much more believable and impressive.
The second half of the night is probably the better of the two. The acts and everything else — costumes, lighting, sound — are grander, scarier, higher and bigger, almost (almost!) to the point where everything stops being remarkable as you become more  drunk off seeing the impossible. A contraption called the Wheel of Death, essentially two wheels on either side of a huge steel beauty suspended several feet in the air, might be the most thrilling act of the night. Two men run on both the inside and outside of the wheels, leaping like alien frogs and making a fool out of gravity.
The fun is nonstop. Members of the audience are toyed with, hilariously pickpocketed and made to disappear by two vulgar clowns and their king. The flashy juggling act couldn’t be better — more than just fast hands, it involves the performer’s head and feet and elbows and neck, in an expert display of charisma and precision — and the same goes for the Chinese Chair act and the show’s finale, which makes nail-biting use of that circus staple, the teeterboard. How they can stick their landings on stilts baffles the mind.
The show’s many creators — there are 13 — all deserve a standing ovation for bringing to life this wondrous circus spectacular. The audience leaves breathless, exhausted, inspired, smiling and heightened.
But ultimately — to paraphrase a song lyric from a musical whose visuals rival Cirque du Soleil’s for brilliance — there are no words in the vernacular to describe this “spectacular, spectacular.”

Both lovers and loathers of the Twilight saga can agree on one thing: The films’ music supervisor is doing something right.
Last year’s Twilight soundtrack, with its finely pruned selection of indie bands like Muse, Mute Math and Iron & Wine, gave the mainstream, otherwise kitschy teen vampire flick art-house credentials.
Moody blues · The indie-studded New Moon soundtrack, which was released Friday, features a mix of hauntingly dark and sunnily lighthearted tracks from Death Cab for Cutie, Grizzly Bear, Lykke Li and Bon Iver. - Photo courtesy of Atlantic Records
The album debuted at No. 1 on the Billboard 200 list and swiftly became the best-selling soundtrack in the United States since Chicago, with more than 3.5 million copies sold worldwide.
In response to overwhelming demand, Chop Shop/Atlantic Records released the soundtrack to the series’ second installment, New Moon (which hits theaters Nov. 20) last Friday — four days ahead of schedule.
It’s easy to see why studio executives were so eager to share the record with the public. The tracklist boasts the names of today’s most venerated indie artists, from established acts like The Killers and Radiohead’s Thom Yorke to obscure folk bands like Grizzly Bear and Sea Wolf, as well as lesser-known songstresses like Lykke Li and Anya Marina.
All the musicians contributed original, previously unreleased songs to the compilation — reason to entice even the staunchest Twilight hater.
The soundtrack is every bit as grungy and brooding as you’d expect, with an eclectic but consistent range of sounds that matches the film’s rainy, brownish-gray color palette.
An ominous cloud settles on the album from the very beginning, with Death Cab for Cutie’s “Meet Me On The Equinox” opening the record on a moody minor-key note (in its refrain, front man Ben Gibbard repeatedly assures you that everything, everything ends).
Much like the film’s dreary setting of Forks, Wash., the clouds on the album never fully lift.
Thom Yorke’s chilling “Hearing Damage” and Black Rebel Motorcycle Club’s acoustic “Done All Wrong” play like aggrieved graveyard laments, while the vocals on Grizzly Bear’s “Slow Life” featuring Victoria Legrand and Editors’ somber piano ballad “No Sound But The Wind” echo despondently.
The clouds do, however, change shape, and the soundtrack’s shadows come in a gradient that ranges from raw angst to quiet melancholy and even cheeky playfulness.
The two female-driven numbers, Lykke Li’s “Possibility” and Anya Marina’s “Satellite Heart,” are slow, brooding and as quietly commanding as Robert Pattinson’s steely stares. On “Roslyn,” Bon Iver’s resonant falsetto melds with St. Vincent’s fragile feminine vocals to create an ethereal, sensuous moment.
Amid all this minor-key melancholy — though it has its place — the rare appearances of cheer on the album are as lovely and welcome as butterflies in a coal mine.
The soundtrack occasionally ventures into the sun with a few lighthearted numbers, notably Sea Wolf’s “The Violet Hour” and OK Go’s “Shooting the Moon.” Despite its pretense of aggressive electric guitar, Band of Skulls’ “Friends” unfolds into an upbeat song about love and friendship (I need love ‘cause only love is true/I need every waking hour with you /And my friends, ‘cause they’re so beautiful/ Yeah my friends they are so beautiful).
As a whole, the New Moon compilation is compellingly gritty and foreboding, fleshed out in aural brown and grays as a soundtrack to a vampire movie set in Forks should be.
Still, you can’t help but crave a bit more sunshine on the record: No one — well, unless you’re a vampire — wants to be where it’s always dark and rainy.

One of the highest aspirations of a filmmaker is to hear that his or her film is “refreshing.”
There is something about the novelty of exploring old archetypes, familiar places and tired stories from previously unprivileged perspectives that leaves us intoxicated by what we are seeing. We can almost feel the synapses from disparate regions of consciousness springing into being, bridging the gaps in our understanding of the world and forcing onto the momentary realization that there is something in the world to be probed beyond the scope of our own experience.
Stop and stare · Paris, Je T’aime producer Emmanuel Benbihy followed up his 2007 compilation of romantic vignettes with New York, I Love You, a series of short segments about those searching for love in New York City. Natalie Portman, Shia LaBeouf and Orlando Bloom are among the film’s cast. - Photo courtest of 42 West
Emmanuel Benbihy, producer of New York, I Love You, knows this. Rather than enlist the aid of the Hollywood heavyweights to fabricate some no-doubt-wonderful-but-all-too-predictable vignettes for the second in his series of films about the spectrum of love in the “mythic cities” of the world, he stayed true to his Paris, Je T’aime mentality, synthesizing the narratives of relative newcomers to the cinematic conversation. Along with fellow producer Marina Grasic (of Crash fame), Benhiby hired 11 young directors — including actress Natalie Portman — to canvas the neighborhoods of the Big Apple and paint the portraits of love in its varied states.
At the film’s outset, the information we receive as viewers is the same worn-out set of clichés we have always heard applied to New York City: New York is overcast, New York is full of pigeons, New York has many cabs, and it is difficult to get one of these cabs to stop for you.
But by the time two of the film’s central characters (if any characters can be called central in a piece that intertwines 11 stories in a way that emphasizes their equal importance) incidentally hop into the same taxi and deliberate over the best route to take to their destination so animatedly that the driver shoos them from the Plexiglas-encased backseat with jaggedly inflected shouts, we are already waving goodbye to the territory of anecdotal moviemaking.
The subsequent short films pair box office staples in addition to Portman, like Hayden Christensen, Rachel Bilson, Orlando Bloom, Christina Ricci, Shia LaBeouf and Chris Cooper with the unestablished filmmakers.
With audiences being led through the lives of an orthodox Jew on the day of her wedding and an older, Middle Eastern diamond salesman who simultaneously fantasize about marrying one another, a high school guy’s unique “first time” involving a tree on prom night in Central Park, a cardiovascularly unsound artist whose prime model eludes him in her Chinatown shop, and an elderly couple on the day of their anniversary — there is definitely something that will strike a chord.
Though the stories are truly powered by raw emotions, that is not to say that they’re not up for interpretation; while one audience member laughs outright at a middle-aged stranger’s unabashedly graphic description of what he would do to ensure that a woman achieve a full-blown orgasm, another will slouch down and cringe in discomfort.
In a later narrative, the same couple is seen through the window of a passing cab, and viewers won’t be able to keep from smirking with the knowledge that their ordinary-appearing interaction is actually an elaborate sexual advance.
Such brief glimpses into the lives of other characters whose love stories come to fruition in other parts of the film are the exact reason that Benhiby wanted Grasic on board. He, like so many others in the cinematic community, was riveted by the interwoven narratives of Crash, which communicated to audience members a coherent thesis about race and identity in Los Angeles. Benhiby’s tapestry of stories creates a similarly rich viewing experience, but it also fails in similar ways.
Unlike the organic tone set by his first opus for the many ways we love in a mystic city, New York, I Love You feels forced. Instances of transcendent amusement, sadness and revulsion are somewhat occluded by the ever-present hand of the production team as it pounds us over the head chanting, “We are all connected! We all love, and we all live in the same world!”
And yet, for all that they emphasize the singleness of experience and of setting in the stories, New York, I Love You also loses something very central to the idea of Paris, Je T’aime and Benhiby’s series in general: the notion of the city itself as a character. For as often as we see the New York skyline, hear the distinct accents of the five boroughs and sample an ethnically diverse cast, these stories still feel like they could have taken place in any city and it would hardly have made a difference. A pity for a city that has been reduced to stereotypes for so long and could stand to feel “refreshed.”

This past weekend, thousands of people stepped away from their computers and traveled to Las Vegas.
Sin City was this year’s home to the Blog World Expo, and geeks everywhere gathered not to gamble, but to talk about their social networking habits.
Every day, the Internet is gaining more recognition as not only a communication tool, but also as a legitimate industry. Conferences are being held to discuss Twitter and Facebook as outlets for both business and pleasure. Exploring how to exploit the web has taken the world by storm, with the first Twitter conference taking place last September in our own City of Angels.
Awards are continually given to honor the outstanding web participants that help us save time, as well as those that help us waste it. For example, Mashable, a popular Internet news blog, has become a Twitter trending topic with the hype surrounding its current Open Web Awards.
In the spirit of these events and ceremonies, I have decided to grace you with my personal recommendations from the almighty Internet. From ways to procrastinate to more ways to procrastinate, I give you the Jen Awards: Eleven sites none of us should live without.
Food Porn Daily: My homepage. This site is exactly what it sounds like, featuring daily close-up photos of food items, such as “Mini Pumpkin Cheesecakes with Graham Cracker Crust” and “Bacon Roasted Vegetable & Sprouted Lentil Salad with Dill Vinaigrette.” The site boasts that it is SFW (Safe For Work) and will make you drool more than anything sex-related will. www.foodporndaily.com
Hipster Runoff: The quintessential postmodern pop culture blog. Written by “Carles,” an anonymous blogger I secretly worship, Hipster Runoff is the perfect blend of news, ironic commentary and cult-level inside jokes. Common themes include American Apparel, indie bands and general cultural fallacies. www.hipsterrunoff.com
Tumblr: The social networking-blog hybrid from the creators of Twitter that takes up most of my spare time. Tumblr prides itself on being a quick and easy alternative to blogging, allowing simple posts of photos, videos, mp3s and more. Additionally, it offers a clean interface and cool community that brings more instant gratification (read: embeds instead of just links) than the Tweets of friends. www.tumblr.com
Stumble Upon: My personal favorite since freshman year, this site manages to make the infinite abyss that is the Internet seem smaller and smaller with every click. You create an account, choose some topics you’re interested in and the website does the rest, helping you discover diamonds in the rough. www.stumbleupon.com
Bing: Google, forgive me. Bing is underrated — a victim of the haters who think Microsoft can’t do anything right. In fact, the search engine is everything and then some. It features stunning photographs updated daily and factoids to go with them, a bit like Google Doodles everyday. Also, most people don’t know that the suite has a cashback program that gives you a large (sometimes 30 percent) refund for products you began searching for on Bing. Don’t be too afraid to make the switch, or at least give it a shot. www.bing.com
The Daily What: If you were unaware of all the things Venn diagrams could be used for, this site might shock you. If you were not aware of the number of meme Balloon Boy parodies that have recently surfaced, this site might shock you. If your favorite aspect of the Internet is simply the fact that someone spent precious moments of his time parodying YouTube videos just so you could have a laugh, The Daily What will definitely be up your alley. thedw.us
Sporcle: A collection of quizzes, from pop culture to ancient history. No offense to our fine institution, but this may be more educational than school — assuming our career goal is to be on Jeopardy. Recommended quiz: “Can you name the things Meatloaf won’t do for love?” www.sporcle.com
Lookbook.nu: Pictures of fashionistas from around the world, posted together to form a compilation of artsy, well-photographed clothing. Beware: Everyone on this website looks unbelievably chic, cool and sexy. It may even inspire you to dress up for class. www.lookbook.nu
Yelp:  My Los Angeles Bible. If you need to know anything about any restaurant, organization or place of business, Yelp offers the Yellow Pages Internet style — users can post reviews, and, from my experience, the collective thoughts of Yelpers is always right. www.yelp.com
Hype Machine: A music blog aggregator that miraculously knows exactly what song you’ll be obsessed with next week. Free music, completely legal and utterly awesome. www.hypem.com
Human Calendar: This is completely unessential, but in so many ways explains precisely why it is impossible to grow sick of the Internet. The site is a fun twist on the classic, and somehow turns a month with numbered days into entertainment. Smiling is the cardinal rule of Jen Awards, and, albeit pointless, the Human Calendar is sure to make you grin. www.humancalendar.com

With the defiant, loud and talkative interaction that our generation practices today — Facebook, iPhones and Blackberrys included — the social media site Twitter fits in just perfectly.
Whether we use Twitter as a cheat sheet to filter through the day’s messy list of top stories (recurring topics like #ObamaNobelPeacePrize or #BalloonBoy will help you out on occasion), or as a means to bring attention to the blasé occurrences in our ordinary lives, digitally connected college students aren’t the only ones getting hooked.
Like the craze of a new Dolce handbag or the buzz around the latest flash diet, Hollywood celebrity Twitters are now a trend. With thousands to millions of Twitter followers at their disposal, famous names have already seen the lucrative marketing opportunities — as well as the image-enhancing benefits — of jumping onto the micro-blogging bandwagon.
But have they realized the repercussions?
With celebrities freely and carelessly Tweeting up a storm — not always with the daily handling and prying eyes of their publicists — they are willfully breaking down a dimension of privacy many an entourage has worked so hard to build up. It has always been this barrier between elusive celebrities and their fan bases that has defined the chasm between Hollywood and the general public.
Through celebrity Tweeting, the fall of this privacy wall, brick by brick, opens up engaged observers to a host of private matters instantly made public. Celebrity fights, friendships and budding relationships between the stars can easily be found on Twitter. It’s all there — captured in a concise 140 characters or less.
Rare, personal glances into the life of reality star Kim Kardashian via Twitter, for instance, force our fixation on popular culture and keep us more tightly fastened to our personal devices. Let’s face it, any of us who are following Kardashian on Twitter don’t actually read her posts but rather wait patiently for one of her infamously revealing TwitPics (one of the site’s many Twabbreviations, this one for a picture update).
As slaves to the emerging media, how do these constantly updating e-relationships reflect our own personalities?
If you follow reality TV villain and USC alumnus Spencer Pratt as he meticulously Tweets about his infallible journey atop the ranks of Hollywood, you are probably a narcissist yourself, or perhaps equally fascinated with the unique self-absorption dynamic which Twitter promotes.
Amid the frequent typos and unexpected use of archaic online jargon (his  favorite is “lol”), Twitter followers of The Real Shaq look to the basketball star for a unique blend of life mantras instilling “Shaqness” complemented with entertaining jokes with a few references to his sport (if you count his mention about attending a LeBron James party). Pretend basketball fans would enjoy themselves.
Like a true artist, singer John Mayer shares a pithy yet slightly delusional patter with his Twitter followers, providing socially conscious words of wisdom sometimes too far-fetched for normal people to understand.
Not surprisingly, lovers of intricate food descriptions and fans of smiling with their eyes follow talk show host Tyra Banks. Proud Twitter followers of President Barack Obama believe they are doing their part in civic participation. And those who claim to be diehard Trojan fans without following USC football coach Pete Carroll’s Twitter should be ashamed.
The publicity potential for celebrity Tweets is obvious. It’s virtually cost-free and has the ability to reach huge audiences with a single click. Though this is all true, is it safe for celebrities to be deviling into a networking tool so closely linked with their fans?
With decades of Hollywood history perpetuating an “us and them” degree of separation, Twitter opens the possibility to real interaction between you and your favorite star. Spooky.
This spoils the mystery and the intrigue left surrounding a celebrity’s appeal. Without any gatekeeper to censor or block information from spreading, there are likely to be some serious problems.
With Twitter, celebrities can trash their employers, naïvely spill sensitive industry information to the public or say something stupid and destroy their reputations in seconds.
Last summer, fights between TV reality show judge Paula Abdul and producers of the show American Idol became the backstory loudly projected across the micro-blogosphere. To display her disappointment and win public support, Abdul used Twitter to announce that she would not be returning to American Idol, before notifying lawyers and handlers of her contract.
Following Abdul’s lead, tons of other celebrities have used the tool to quit jobs, vent their anger and publicly call out their enemies. Essentially, Twitter allows traditionally tight-lipped celebrities to rebelliously speak the truth.
But as stars no longer hold back — forever changing the paradigm of celebrity — maybe the public won’t be able to handle it.

As Pakistan deals with multiple domestic terrorist attacks and gears up for the third day of its all-out offensive against the Taliban — and militant-infested South Waziristan — the United States is keeping an eye on Pakistan’s nuclear arsenal.
Over the past week, Pakistan has witnessed some of its most deadly attacks in recent years, which have killed 160 people. The attacks ranged from terrorist strikes against civilian targets to an attack on one of Pakistan’s most secure institution — its army headquarters.
The rash of attacks demonstrated a need for Pakistan to go on the offensive — a move that has been partially financed by the United States.
Although both the United States and Britain expressed their confidence in Pakistan’s control of its nuclear weapons, the attack on the army headquarters has caused concern at the State Department because it raises the possibility of Taliban spies and double agents within the Pakistani military.
The Pakistani military denies the possibility, but many believe that the attack would have been impossible to carry out without a close inside source providing key information to the militants.
The United States has reason to worry that such inside information about Pakistan’s nuclear weapons could possibly be leaked to terrorists. After all, as Bruce Riedel — a senior fellow at the Saban Center for Middle East Policy — wrote in a article for the Brookings Institute blog, “If the Taliban can get into army headquarters, where else might it strike next?”
The country has much to do before it can secure the area. Pakistan’s offensive against South Waziristan consists of 30,000 soldiers. They will be facing as many as 10,000 militants made up of Pakistani and foreign-born fighters from the Taliban, al-Qaida and other terrorist groups.
The Pakistani army has failed three times in securing the region and has instead resorted to a shaky peace deal. But the recent wave of attacks has proven that deal meaningless, so the army has begun to move in order to dismantle the terrorist sanctuary.
Pakistani leader Asif Ali Zardari is hoping the recent wave of attacks  against Pakistani civilians will create popular support for the offensive.
US officials support the offensive, for if the Pakistani army doesn’t take control of the situation, American positions in Afghanistan could be threatened.
“If it’s a blow to al-Qaida, if it takes away one of their sanctuaries, if it makes Pakistan a safer place, then it will be a positive,” a US military official told the Associated Press.
Taliban spokesman Azam Tariq responded in an interview with the AP, saying “we know how to fight this war and defeat the enemy with the minimum loss of our men. This is a war bound to end in the defeat of the Pakistan army.”
This offensive is necessary for the safety of the entire region and cannot be avoided. The United States has already provided billions of dollars in aid to Pakistan in hopes that the nation would use it to crush its militant Islamic insurgency.
Instead, Pakistan has used the majority of the money to either buy heavy military equipment, such as tanks and missiles to combat its rival India, or to satisfy the greed of corrupt politicians. The nation has tried to avoid such an open war with its insurgents, but now there is no other choice.
The United States must keep the Waziristan-Afghanistan border secure to make sure no terrorists try to flee the area. Furthermore, an increased American offensive on the border may help in surrounding the terrorists and forcing them into a concentrated area, making other parts of the nation safer.
Shots were fired Sunday, and by Monday the Pakistani military had attacked the area on three fronts, surrounding the terrorists. At the same time, refugees must be granted access to camps outside of the warzone. The United Nations says that already 150,000 civilians have left the area, and many more are expected to leave once the fighting intensifies.
Material aid must be made available to refugees by the Pakistani government in order to win their support in the war against the Taliban. By showing they are fighting for the people and their safety, Pakistan is increasing its chances of securing its nation in the long run.
The next several weeks have the potential to greatly reduce or increase Islamic militancy in the region. The world’s eyes will be on the Pakistani military and American financiers as they makes their strike on the terrorist stronghold in Waziristan.

Parliamentary pressure
In Rosaleen O’Sullivan’s article titled “British court values human rights over diplomancy,” she writes that “this case is an exception to the [intelligence sharing secrecy] rule in that Britain’s reasons for releasing the information are domestic; it is not setting any true precedent for future intelligence policy.”
Her argument is that since it is the British court, not the parliament, who is asking for the release of the information, then it is different because American intelligence agencies know that they have very little control over the High Courts, and therefore they should expect this sort of action occasionally.
In other words, since the American intelligence services know very well how the British judicial system works, as long as the parliament does what it can to prevent the release, no offense should be taken by the United States.
All intelligence agencies can do is put pressure on parliament. But if indeed British intelligence really faces a potential loss, her article, in my opinion, misses the point. Hillary Clinton was likely told to put that pressure on Britain by the British intelligence itself (perhaps indirectly, by way of the CIA followed by the president or another US official).
This is opposed to the claim that she is taking a “hard-line approach to the issue because it fundamentally challenges her perceptions of how intelligence-sharing operations should be conducted.”

After No. 4 Virginia Tech was upset last weekend, many expected the Trojans to gain ground in the upcoming BCS polls. Instead, it appears USC will have another tough path to climb.
The Trojans are ranked No. 7 in the season’s first BCS rankings. They are the highest rated one-loss team, but are behind Boise State (No. 4), Cincinnati (No. 5) and Iowa (No. 6), all teams that were ranked lower than USC in the Coaches and AP polls.
Florida is ranked No. 1, followed by Alabama and Texas.
Since only the two top-rated teams in the BCS play for the National Championship, the Trojans need many teams in front of them to lose if they are to have a chance to play in that game. Two factors that may help USC’s cause? Oregon is ranked No. 12 in the BCS rankings, while Arizona is rated No. 22.
USC faces the Ducks on Oct. 31 and takes on the Wildcats on Dec. 5.

A number of popular restaurants at The Lot — including Baja Fresh and Wolfgang Puck — remain closed as of 6 p.m. Monday after a fire alarm prompted officials to shut down services.
Employees said the affected restaurants — all those on the south side of the tent — would be closed at least through 7 p.m. if not for the remainder of the night. All restaurants are expected to be operational tomorrow, employees said.
USC Hospitality could not be reached for comment.

Student Union Building was evacuated yesterday so that USC workers could finally harvest the honey from the bee hives hidden in the elevator shaft.
Well, since no one knew about the nest  until the building was attacked by bees on Sunday afternoon, there was never actually any plan to profit from the misfortune of Daily Trojan staff and other administration who narrowly escaped the insect insurgency.
UNLESS…the bees were part of a larger faculty conspiracy that also involves the alleged petting zoo on the fourth floor of the book store?
Unlikely. Just be happy the DT were able to get out a paper today. And in the meantime, consider why anyone would ever want to be a beekeeper.
