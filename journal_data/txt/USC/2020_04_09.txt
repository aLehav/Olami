Last month, a letter from Provost Charles Zukoski informed undergraduate students that they would have the option to take all their courses pass/no pass or no record for the Spring 2020 semester. The email told students that these courses would count toward all University requirements and that students would have until May 27 to make their decision, after final exams have been graded. 
This announcement was just one of many that followed USC’s decision to move all courses online for the remainder of the semester in light of the increased severity of the coronavirus pandemic. While this solution is imperfect, it shows the University’s commitment to allow students to take charge of their own academics and equips students for different possibilities in these uncertain times. 
Schools across the country have implemented different grading schemes for this term and many have advocated for a mandatory pass/no pass policy. Such a policy would enforce a sense of equality across USC, forcing all students to adopt the same grading scale for the year and reducing competition. However, this completely removes the opportunity for students to improve their GPA’s this semester, something that might make all the difference between future job opportunities and graduate school. 
Giving the choice to switch courses allows for more freedom on the part of the students. For those who have gone home to sick family members or out-of-work parents, having the option to move all of one’s grades to pass/no pass could relieve a large burden. While students still have to attend classes and do the work, they can allocate their energy to dealing with immediate problems their family might be facing in this unprecedented time. 
This change also allows those students who plan to pursue education beyond a four-year university to keep their academic rigor at a similarly high level. Many of these students, including those attending graduate school, medical school or any PhD program may not be able to take a whole semester pass/no pass and still attend the program of their choice. 
This switch to pass/no pass or some variation is not uncommon for universities across the United States. Alongside USC, UCLA and Yale have both adopted this student-choice option for pass/no pass, in addition to extending deadlines for dropping classes. Other California schools like Stanford have taken a more drastic stance, adopting a mandatory pass/no pass system for all undergraduate students. 
While USC made it clear in their March 30 memo that this semester’s grades would have no impact on their graduate school admissions, it’s impossible to know if other graduate schools will forgive a semester of pass/no pass courses. Forcing students into a pass/no pass system gambles students’ grades on a possibility, rather than giving them control over their academic futures.
Student groups have pushed the issue even farther, calling for measures such as “universal pass” for college students. The Los Angeles Times reports that UC Berkeley students proposed a measure to guarantee “A’s for All” for the spring semester, while student groups at Yale and UCLA have hotly debated the merits of a universal pass system. While such a change could help those who are struggling amid the coronavirus pandemic, it faces similar issues as the universal pass/no pass system. 
By denying students access to their grades, they could lose out on possible opportunities later in life. In addition, the change completely removes any motivation for students to put any work into their studies. This devalues the work that students have put into their classes and all the work that professors have done in order to make engaging and rigorous course plans for their students. USC’s choice to move the pass/no pass deadline until after finals alleviates some of this pressure, as students can make the decision based on their final grades in each class. 
While none of these solutions are perfect, USC’s pass/no pass option gives the most freedom to students, allowing them to treat their academic lives how they see fit. While this is an extremely strange and tough time for all students, dedicating some time to coursework and studies can help provide some structure and normalcy. It can also allow students to interact with their classmates and find some sense of community even though they are unable to leave their homes. The University’s policy shows that in these trying times, it cares about both the personal and academic needs of its students.

There’s a certain wilderness to innate thought that we will never be able to capture. This is because our own thought has been tamed and civilized by language. Our thought has become structured, formed by the sounds and shapes of words. 
Language seems so intimate to us and visceral to our life experiences. Indeed, it is hard to differentiate language from thought. They seem so interchangeable, but they are not. There’s a difference between what is innate to us and what is not, between what is universal and what is learned.
Language is learned. It gives voice to our thoughts. It is a liberator, allowing our thoughts and feelings to escape the vicinities where they were concocted, felt and communicated to the world. We take language to be our own but we forget that it never was, and even as it releases our minds from inner silence, it constricts our thoughts to the molds of a particular language’s grammar logic and sentence structure. Learned rules that are not your own.
Language is a building block. It might seem the most infantile building block, but it is one nonetheless. The untrained brain, that is, the mind without language, is but the map of a virgin rainforest, untouched by humans and living by its own rhythm. A language of its own, we might like to say, except it has none. It is the absence of language; nothing about it is learned.
What do these blocks build up to? Culture. Language is the collective brain of an entire people, and as a young infant learns a language, she becomes one more link in that particular network of human ingenuity. 
French is subtle. Its tones and accentuations are soft and smooth, like the creamy pastries and soups its cuisine is celebrated for. Its flow is legato, like simmering melodies or the brushstrokes of a lily pad pond on an impressionist canvas. 
French is subtile, like a Parisian woman lighting a cigarette while she sips Bourgogne, with rouge on her lips and the faintest glimmer of a smile in her eyes. Is it inviting? Uncertain. But what can be expected given the language? 
French flirts with equivocality. Aimer can mean everything from obsessive love to the faintest inclination of acknowledgement. French is rational, with a signature dab of eccentricism. It is the language of the enlightenment, of the metric system, of hot air balloons and baguettes.
Spanish is passionate. Amor is just one of a million different words and adjectives to describe in liveliest detail the rapture of an enamored heart. Spanish is saturated. Beyond the beating heart, red runs deep with the fervor and intensity of a bullfighter’s dancing cloak; an explosion of moving color is not only seen but experienced on dancing ladies in full-garbed traditional Mexican folklórico dresses. 
Spanish is honorable. A language of chivalry and gentlemen, of tradition and loyalty, of family values and proud obstinance, although we’d rather call it endurance. Spanish is loud. Staccato punctuates the air as a warm family gathering bustles around a table feast.
English is practical. Conjugations are simple. Articles don’t have gender. Everything is contracted. This is that and that is this. Any other language you stick a word of into English sounds incredibly fancy. But that is because English isn’t made for lumières to ponder; it’s made to put man on the moon. Or maybe fix a tire.
English is future-oriented. Unlike in other languages, here adjectives precede nouns. It is always looking forward. Big house, fast car, bright future. English is accomodating. It makes spelling rules it doesn’t care about in the slightest. Vowels are supposed to sound one way but if you really want to, you can spell out fish as “ghoti”. 
Yes, language is the first building block of culture, and in everything from its syntax to its accentuations to its structure, it reflects a particular way of looking at the world. Particular attention is given to certain ideas, such as emotions in Spanish, and a particular ambiguity in others, such as love in French. 
Each culture is unique and different, but all are learned. And in the learning of that first language in our infancy — which of course we don’t remember — we lose our wilderness of thought, drawing demarcations on the map in our brain around the kingdom of Czech or Arabic or whatever that first language might be, and leaving the rest of our brain unexplored. One day we might decide to venture out into the unexplored, to make new roads and draw new demarcations along the way. In learning a new language, we rediscover parts of ourselves we had lost contact with when we became fluent in our first.
While learning a new language you find yourself enraptured in an inexpressible kind of ecstasy at rediscovering those lost parts of yourself. Any time you experience a new culture, it feels foreign but also, strangely, so familiar. In some aspects it is much less foreign than that first one you’ve been used to for so long. 
The biggest joys perhaps are those first signs of fluency in a second or third language after months of hard work. You surprise yourself waking up from a dream dreamt in a different language and you triumphantly realize that that night, you ventured deep into that foreign unexplored and you never ventured out.

Baseball fans, rejoice: The finish line — or, more appropriately, the starting line — is in sight.
On Monday, ESPN Major League Baseball insider Jeff Passan reported that MLB is considering a plan to locate all 30 teams at Arizona hotels and use various Spring Training facilities and the Arizona Diamondbacks’ Chase Field in Phoenix to hold games possibly as early as May.
To say it would be a stray from the norm would be quite the understatement. The league could use electronic strike zones and seven-inning doubleheaders, ban fans from attending and mandate that players sit in the stands six feet apart rather than in the dugout during games. 
Nevermind how indisputably bizarre the plan is — should it go into action, which is still far from a certainty as it currently stands, the league’s status as the sole operating sports league in the United States would put it in a prime position to largely alleviate one of its most pressing concerns of the past decade.
MLB has made concerted efforts in recent years to grow the game to a broader demographic, and frankly, those efforts haven’t gone far enough — a baseball aficionado like myself can acknowledge that much. Knocking a few seconds off the average game by automatically issuing intentional walks instead of requiring four half-assed lobs wide of home plate can only go so far in attracting a younger audience that seems increasingly drawn to the flash and flair of the NBA and NFL. 
The problem for MLB isn’t that the games are too long, it’s that the league thinks that’s the problem. Meanwhile, it has failed to take the essential step that its American major-sport counterparts have long since figured out by now: marketing its own players. It’s why, according to YouGov, 91% of Americans have heard of LeBron James, 88% have heard of Tom Brady and only 43% have heard of Mike Trout. The league seems more preoccupied with the Sharpie colors on players’ cleats than the fact that maybe, just maybe, fans are drawn to personality more than tradition. 
Despite all the league’s shortcomings when it comes to spreading the game, it might get bailed out by the unlikeliest of catalysts: the coronavirus pandemic. 
If baseball returns in May — far earlier than anyone originally expected — those who have been turned off from baseball because of its perception as slow and boring will come crawling back to their television sets for America’s national pastime even if simply because it’s the only option. 
It’s exactly what MLB needs. If the league can find a way to grasp the moment and run with it, the impact will last well beyond the scope of the current crisis.
Based on Passan’s report, the early signs indicate that MLB is realizing this opportunity. The league is considering regularly equipping players with microphones during games to provide an enhanced broadcast experience for viewers similar to the in-game interviews broadcast crews often held with players during Spring Training. Exposing an expected high number of fans to the concept that baseball players are actually living, breathing human beings with personalities rather than robots who stand around trying not to fall asleep all game should do wonders for the game’s appeal.
The concept that MLB can actually capitalize on the fact that U.S. society has shut down due to a virus that has taken thousands of lives in the last few weeks is incredibly bittersweet — and far more bitter than sweet. Though the road has been depressingly unfortunate and tragic, the destination is one that MLB can use as an opportunity to provide desperate fans with the entertainment we’ve so sorely been lacking ever since college sports were called off March 12.
I realize this is an ideal situation for absolutely no one. I just want baseball back, and in my eyes, everything else is gravy — but I realize I’m far outnumbered by my equivalents in the basketball sphere.
For every MLB fan who can’t wait to see Houston Astros take 95 to the ribs once baseball returns, there are 10 NBA fans dying for a chance to see LeBron take on Giannis Antetokounmpo in the NBA Finals or Zion Williamson cap off his rookie season with a New Orleans Pelicans playoff chase. In general, it’s becoming increasingly evident that fans would push everything else aside just for a chance to see the 2019-20 NBA season played out until one team reigns supreme.
Bad news: It’s probably not happening. As of last week or so, the NBA has been preparing scenarios to fully shut down the remainder of the 2019-20 season. 
For the basketball diehards, especially those in Los Angeles, it’ll be a tough pill to swallow. But come May, if there’s anything, anything happening in the sports world, even those who (incorrectly) claim baseball is boring will come to their collective senses and compromise. MLB will likely do everything it can to make baseball happen this year not just because it wants Bryce Harper’s 2020 MVP campaign to materialize, but also because it wants the pastime to become the present-time and future-time as well. 
It’s a golden opportunity, and Major League Baseball should be chomping at the bit.

With Los Angeles shutting down beaches and trails and gloomy April weather settling in, you might be getting a bit stir-crazy. Not to fear — you can still get a taste of the outdoors from the comfort of your couch. So while your hiking boots wait patiently in the closet for their next adventure, indulge in some guilt-free streaming with these recommended nature documentaries. 
HULU
“March of the Penguins 2: The Next Step”
This 2017 documentary might not be a new release, but it’s surely a classic. In a follow-up to the wildly popular “March of the Penguins” released in 2005, director Luc Jacquet revisits the Antarctic to follow the story of two emperor penguins struggling to overcome the hostile conditions of the continent. If you enjoyed the original, you won’t be let down by the sequel. 
“Great Shark Chow Down”
If you want something a little more adrenaline-inducing, “Great Shark Chow Down” will do the job. The series follows filmmakers and scientists as they go to the biggest feeding grounds for sharks and track how the species’ hunting style has evolved over time. Be forewarned that it has got some brutal imagery; this is for those with a strong stomach and a serious love of Shark Week. Yes, it’s a bit “Jaws”–esque, but hey, it’s educational! 
“Free Solo”
This feature documentary follows Alex Honnold, a free-solo climber, as he attempts to scale the Freerider route on Yosemite National Park’s El Capitan. Yes, that’s right: Honnold’s lifelong dream is to climb the 3,300-foot sheer cliffside with nothing but his hands. The stakes are very, very high; it’s a death-defying pursuit, one that’s never been pulled off before. Honnold’s dizzying escapades will make even the most stoic viewer’s heart pound, but despite its vertigo-inducing visuals, the film garnered unanimously positive reviews from critics and rustled up a few award nominations as well. This pick will definitely keep you glued to your seat for the full 100-minute runtime.
NETFLIX 
“The Dawn Wall”
If you’ve already seen “Free Solo,” consider “The Dawn Wall,” its unofficial prequel. In 2015, rock climbing partners Tommy Caldwell and Kevin Jorgeson captured the media’s attention with their attempt to scale the steepest face of the El Capitan rock formation in Yosemite, known as the Dawn Wall. Directors Josh Lowell and Peter Mortimer, long-time documentarians of extreme athletes, follow the duo’s bid over 19 days to become the first to scale the Dawn Wall. It’s a nerve-wracking watch, but the adrenaline rush is well worth it. Not to mention, there’s a rather harrowing account of Caldwell’s experience as a hostage in Kyrgyzstan during a climbing trip back in 2000. The film cleaned up in the 2018 award season, even winning the audience award at the SXSW Film Festival. 
“Our Planet”
If you haven’t gotten around to watching this popular 2019 release, now’s the time — there are talks of the second season being released this summer. This nature docuseries, Netflix’s most ambitious to date, took four years of filming to create. But it’s clear the time was worth it, as the series has struck a chord among audience members and critics alike. 
Broadcaster and natural historian David Attenborough narrates the eight-episode season, examining the impact of climate change on ecosystems spanning approximately 50 countries. Viewers are transported from the plains of the Serengeti to the icy Arctic Circle to the Congo rainforests and more. Filled with images of Earth’s remaining natural spaces, the series is as aesthetically pleasing as it is educational. Plus, is there anything as soothing as Attenborough’s voice? 
“Night on Earth” 
This documentary uses high-tech cameras to portray the nocturnal lives of wild animals in settings ranging from the cityscape to the sea across seven mind-bending episodes. It’s Earth as you’ve never seen it before: Cheetahs glow in the dark and stars spiral overhead while elephants lumber through the darkness. The imagery borders on magical, and it’s a welcomed change of pace from brightly-lit, often oversaturated nature documentaries. The stunning visuals are overlaid by the soothing voice of “Orange Is The New Black” actress Samira Wiley. If you’re looking to be captivated by spectacular optics, this is the documentary for you. 
“Magical Andes” 
This six-episode series is perfect for those seeking a little sociocultural exploration. Each episode follows a character from one of the South American countries (including Chile, Argentina, Peru, Ecuador, Colombia and Bolivia) that the Andes crosses. Between breathtaking shots of the mountainside, each subject explains their connection to the land and the reason they’re rooted to it. The Andes mountain range inspires those who live near them, and they’ll inspire you, too, if you watch this series. 
DISNEY+ 
“African Cats”
With Disney+ offering many of its Disneynature documentary films and series, there’s plenty to choose from. Sick of watching “The Lion King” on loop? “African Cats,” narrated by actor Samuel L. Jackson, follows two families of big cats struggling to survive in a Kenyan reserve. One is a family of cheetahs facing conflict with a band of roving hyenas; the other a lion pride threatened by an exiled lion. (Yes, those plot points do sound awfully familiar.) It’s a great change of pace from the films Disney has to offer, and there’s no doubt you’ll be entertained. 
“Chimpanzee” 
This film follows the life of Oscar, an orphaned chimpanzee. He’s adopted into a group that’s threatened by a set of rival chimps that’s headed by a chimpanzee aptly named Scar. This is an excellent pick for those new to nature documentaries. Narrated by actor Tim Allen, the events of Oscar’s life are remarkably Disney-ish. And it’s not too long, either — the entire 75-minute runtime is compelling.

Peter Weber set out on “The Bachelor” with hopes of finally finding love and a future wife. Instead, he got an extremely disappointing result that left him back at square one. While there were a number of self-inflicted factors that influenced the outcome of this season, there was still an overarching presence behind the scenes that orchestrated the overall plot. 
I’m referring to the ABC producers and their unceasing dedication to concoct as much drama as possible for audiences. The problem is that they did so at the expense of the contestants and especially Weber, who was constantly confused and overwhelmed by the tensions around him.
This season, the producers showed that they never miss an opportunity to stir the pot. Their first bold act was to bring back Hannah Brown, who was fresh off a breakup with Weber from her season on “The Bachelorette,” on not one, but two instances. 
Social media exploded when she stepped out of the limo on night one and then again when she returned to ruin Weber’s first group date. For him, it was a nightmare. The woman who rejected him and broke his heart spoiled the group date by breaking down and tearfully talking about what could have been. The producers’ first curveball was almost too much for Weber to handle as his demeanor hinted that he still wasn’t over Brown, but this drama is exactly what they were aiming for since it drew attention on social media. 
While that was the last time we heard from Brown on the show, there was a third possible awkward scenario she was involved in. A former classmate of Brown’s revealed on Twitter that contestant Sydney Hightower went to high school with Brown. 
Although there might not be any solid evidence showing that the producers were trying to haunt Weber with Brown, it’s also hard to argue in support of the idea that this connection was a mere coincidence. In light of the producers’ ability to mix things up in unexpected ways and Weber’s soft spot for Brown, it’s possible that the producers were trying to develop an intriguing storyline between Brown and Hightower. However, Hightower was sent home before Weber ever learned of her link to Brown. 
While Hightower’s past didn’t come into play, Victoria Fuller’s history played a huge role in her relationship with Peter and further demonstrates the producers’ uncanny ability to make things awkward for everyone. Victoria had seemingly developed a good rapport with Peter, but their relationship was clearly not meant to last even though she was among the final three. 
Of all the contestants, I felt that Victoria was manipulated the most by the producers. They first wronged her by setting up a one-on-one date between her and Peter at a special concert with country singer Chase Rice, who, by no coincidence, happened to be her ex-boyfriend. 
When she realized she would have to be seen front and center with her new boyfriend in front of Rice, she must have felt extremely uncomfortable. I’m sure Rice felt the same, as he was also blindsided by the encounter. 
But that’s not all that the producers did to Victoria. They pulled an even bigger wild card later in the season by using one of Peter’s ex-girlfriends, Merissa Pence, who happened to know Victoria (what a surprise). Pence told Weber that Victoria was responsible for ending multiple relationships among their friend group, which came as a major shock to Peter. 
This further proves that the producers’ schemes overwhelmed Weber and left him confused and prone to making irrational decisions. With their extensive knowledge and research of each contestant, there was no way the producers were going to let such a major red flag slip through their fingers. The producers handpick the contestants for a reason, and in my opinion, they chose Victoria to be on the show because her controversy would create the notorious drama the show embodies.
Unlike Sydney, Victoria’s past was put on full display through the strange, interwoven history between her, Weber and Pence — and it proved too good an opportunity for the producers to pass up. The situation makes “The Bachelor” producers seem like cruel, evil masterminds, and it’s easy to see why.
However, at the end of the day, you could also argue that the producers are merely doing their jobs. They’re simply increasing ratings, and the easiest way to do that is by making things as dramatic as possible. So maybe the producers aren’t fully to blame, as they are just one part of a bigger problem: The show itself is rotten through and through.
It’s possible that the producers were responsible for Peter’s unfortunate ending, as they added plenty of twists to this season, but a deeper look at the bigger picture once again exposes the dark reality of “The Bachelor” and its manipulation of people in the name of “good TV.”

The federal government filed a response in the college admissions case Wednesday refuting allegations that it deliberately delayed releasing relevant evidence to the defense.
In the response, the prosecution accused the parents of misrepresenting the case as solely about bribery. The government argued that the parents’ intent to defraud universities and testing companies by falsifying athletic recruitment profiles, paying for their children’s admission under the guise of philanthropy and cheating on college entrance exams made them guilty with or without the bribery charges.
“The defendants’ brief, despite its comprehensive catalogue of alleged government misconduct, tries to sanitize their actions by ignoring any mention of the larger fraud scheme within which the alleged bribery occurred,” the document read. “But their claims, and the evidence in this case, must be viewed in the context of the actual indictment, not the imaginary one they would prefer to fight.”
The response comes after the parents filed a motion last week requesting that their charges be dropped on the grounds that the case was not tied to Massachusetts despite being tried in Boston federal court. It also follows the submission of a memorandum last month alleging that the government had coerced scheme organizer William “Rick” Singer into falsely stating he had not misled parents to believe their bribes to university officials would be donated to legitimate school programs and accusing prosecutors of scripting testimonies for Singer to paint the parents’ actions in a more negative light.
“The disclosures also reveal the lengths to which the Government went to micromanage the
substance of Singer’s recorded consensual calls to generate incriminating evidence — and to hide those efforts from Defendants,” the memorandum read. “The Government was
coaching Singer to avoid mention of accurate but exculpatory material that would muddy the
black-and-white picture of wrongdoing it sought to create through Singer’s calls.”
In the response, the government quoted emails between Singer and each of the defendants sent during the scheme that it said proved the parents intentionally fabricated application materials and disguised payments thereto as charitable donations. It also argued that the parents could be proven guilty even without Singer’s witness statements. The response cited findings from a four-month investigation into the admissions scheme, including wiretaps of the defendants’ phone calls and emails, that the FBI launched in June 2018 — three months before Singer began cooperating with federal prosecutors.
Trials for the 14 parents, including 11 with USC ties, who opted to plead not guilty in the Operation Varsity Blues case are set to begin in October and continue through early 2021. Coaches and officials fighting charges will likely stand trial next year after the court issues the parents’ verdicts.

Foreseeing personal protective equipment shortages for health care workers treating coronavirus patients, Keck Medicine of USC sent a plea to other USC schools for personal protective equipment donations on March 18. Within days, faculty and staff initiated a virtual collaboration using their makerspaces, laboratories and materials to not only donate existing supplies but also to produce their own. 
Initially, teams from different schools focused on prototyping separate pseudo N95 respiratory masks and face shields, the face gear most commonly used among health care workers as preferred by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Groups such as the Iovine and Young Academy Makerspace and the School of Architecture’s Operation PPE Network focused on creating face masks while the Armani Research Lab and other USC groups experimented with developing additional equipment essential to PPE maintenance, including an ultraviolet cleaning system that would allow for PPE to be reused.
As projects among the schools developed, engineering professor Satyandra Gupta, the director of the Center for Advanced Manufacturing, decided it was time to unify efforts between schools and teams by organizing a virtual symposium to clarify design standards and the donation drop-off process.
“We have to bring the entire community together to make sure we understand overall what the needs are and then figure out what role each of us can play … so that all of us can learn from Keck people as to what really is needed, how many quantities, which design they like, have tested and believe are going to work,” Gupta said.  
Sixty-seven Keck Medicine and USC faculty, staff and doctoral students attended the symposium, held Friday over Zoom. In the symposium, Kymberly Lengyel, an associate administrator of infection control at Keck, informed attendees that Keck will require twice the amount of disposable PPE they currently use for the six- to eight-week-long surge it is expecting in the near future. In other words, Keck will need 2,000 N95 masks and 2,000 face shields per day to be ready during this surge period. 
As of April 2, Keck is treating nine confirmed coronavirus patients and evaluating 11 suspected cases of the virus, Lengyel told attendees. 
Team leaders presented the designs they were using for the machines they had available but agreed not to enforce a standard design given each team’s differences in production tools and capabilities. The donation procedure to contribute to supplies is public on Keck’s website. After delivering parts to drop-off locations, Darryl Hwa Hwang, an assistant professor of research radiology, picks them up and delivers them to Keck where the parts are evaluated for quality by Lengyel and then assembled under hygienic standards.    
Hwang is the point person for collecting donations and communicating with the multiple groups working to produce PPE. In his current position, Hwang provides input on equipment models and interacts with infection prevention specialists on the quality and utility of the products. 
“I realized that I was in a unique position where I can get prototypes tested to see their efficacy and also interact with infection prevention to make sure that they’re happy with whatever we’re making,” Hwang said. “Because of that link, I got drawn into multiple existing projects.”
As each of the schools hunkered down on their part in supporting local health care workers, Andrea Armani, the Ray Irani Chair in chemical engineering and materials science, and her team spent three days prototyping, testing, building and deploying an ultraviolet light system to disinfect face shields for reuse. Her team worked from home, as most on-campus laboratories are closed. They’ve sent 45 of the systems to hospitals in Southern California.  
“We’re talking at-home 3D printers, putting shields together in their bedrooms or living rooms or dens, and it’s a matter of how many members of my lab are doing this in their spare time,” Armani said. “Right now, it’s about five members of my research group as well as my husband and I and members of the community.” 
Armani’s lab has partnered with the School of Architecture and the IYA’s Makerspace to use 3D printing and laser-cutting technologies to produce 6,000 reusable face shields. In collaboration with Keck and local manufacturing companies, the lab made the face shields easier to create by shifting the positioning of the headband pegs slightly upward to make them more compatible with a broader range of 3D printers.
Seth Wieman, the foreman of the Viterbi/Dornsife Machine Shop, has also produced face shields alongside two other staff members. The shop’s initial production phase is about 200 face shields, with higher-scale production ramping up in the coming weeks. 
Others within the School of Architecture have also put their skills to use to combat the virus. Alvin Huang, an associate professor of architecture, has mobilized more than 200 volunteers to use 3D printers to print face shields and two sizes of pseudo N95 masks. In less than a week, his volunteer network of School of Architecture faculty, students, alumni and private firms has printed more than 2,000 combined pseudo N95 masks and face shields to distribute to Keck, L.A. County + USC Medical Center, Children’s Hospital Los Angeles and Martin Luther King, Jr. Hospital in South Los Angeles. 
In a similar fashion, IYA is also creating face shields to supply to hospitals. Tucker Rae-Grant, the digital fabrication lab specialist of IYA’s Makerspace, took into consideration the fact that their team will most likely not be able to provide enough supplies to hospitals using 3D printing as they figured out what role they could play in producing PPE. With this problem in mind, Rae-Grant found an open source laser-cutting design for face shields from the University of Wisconsin-Madison, which he’s using to produce 400 face shields a week with the Makerspace’s three laser cutters, a rate that would have been faster than creating masks using a 3D printer.
Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti visited the IYA Makerspace Sunday to show gratitude to the workers creating the face masks, while also creating three face shields himself. 
“In a great partnership feedback between Keck, the school of medicine, and the hospitals that USC runs, they are able to look in real time and ask for changes in equipment … to help folks be able to make sure that they can stay safe while they are saving our lives,” Garcetti said in a Facebook Live video. 
The face shield parts from all collaborating schools are dropped off at either the University Park or Health Sciences campus. There, the parts are then assembled under the inspection of Lengyel and the Keck infection prevention team.
“We have to …  get that education out there to ensure that we are delivering the safest practices for the healthcare workers and making sure that they have the personal protective equipment to keep them safe and make sure they know how to use it correctly — donning and adopting it correctly each and every time they use personal protective equipment,” Lengyel said.  
Other forms of PPE donations have come from other USC schools and institutes as well. The staff of the Wrigley Institute for Environmental Studies on Catalina Island rallied to find N95 masks in earthquake emergency kits and sent them along with N100 masks, safety goggles and safety glasses to the mainland over several shipments. School of Dramatic Arts Head of Production Elsbeth Collins and her production staff are sewing face mask covers to donate to Keck. Since dramatic productions have been canceled, Collins assembled sewing kits for her staff so that they could produce 160 to 200 mask covers per week. 
Whether sewing, 3D printing or laser-cutting, the cumulative efforts of each team are to try and best prepare Los Angeles for increasing surges in hospitals, Lengyel said. 
“It’s not just everybody at USC coming together but it’s really everybody in Los Angeles coming together — it’s bigger than USC,” Armani said. “Getting industry participation, family member participation, that’s really what’s so remarkable. Having faculty members collaborate with each other, that happens all the time. But getting industry to volunteer their time, to donate materials, that’s what’s really unique about what’s happening right now.”

Every weekday, volunteers gather in the YMCA building on Whittier Boulevard to fill black tote bags with bread, grains, fruits and vegetables. As part of the USC Food Drive, they provide groceries, sanitary items and wellness checks to South and Southeast Los Angeles community members most affected by the coronavirus pandemic. 
Created through a collaboration between USC Civic Engagement, Adventist Health White Memorial Hospital, located in Boyle Heights, and Weingart East Los Angeles YMCA, the food drive secures funding and donations from several partners to deliver bags of essentials to those in need.
Dulce Acosta, executive director of community partnerships for the USC Health Sciences Campus, said the food drive began after she noticed elderly people in her Boyle Heights neighborhood having to go out for groceries. 
“Our focus is to try to keep at least our most vulnerable families and elders specifically at home, because they’re the ones that are probably not going to survive this if they get the virus,” Acosta said. “For us, it was more like a calling to really just help our brothers and sisters.”
Acosta wanted to create a solution to the rise in panic-buying and limit trips outdoors for necessities. As the coronavirus spread worsened, Acosta collaborated with Weingart East L.A. YMCA executive director Mario Valenzuela to find ways their organizations could help the Boyle Heights community. They presented their ideas to their superiors and began to gather the resources to set up their food drive project.
As Acosta and Valenzuela created a plan to obtain funding and volunteers for the food drive, White Memorial provided $25,000 in funding for the drive and a space to initiate the food distribution process. Since its inception, volunteers have gone from delivering 150 bags of fresh fruits and vegetables a day to delivering more than 2,500 bags of groceries to single mothers and seniors. 
The number of communities served has also expanded. Starting in Boyle Heights, the drive has now spread into other regions including Maywood, Huntington Park, Vernon, El Sereno, Lincoln Heights, Montebello and East L.A. 
Deysi Serrano, who owns Milpa Grille in Boyle Heights, has been helping with the drive since having to close down her restaurant since employees were worried about continuing to work as the coronavirus pandemic developed. Serrano, who previously worked with USC, White Memorial and the YMCA to plan community and charity events, directs the packing of fruits and vegetables at the food drive and ensures volunteers follow social distancing and proper sanitation protocols. 
Volunteering with the drive, Serrano views the pandemic as an opportunity to aid those in dire situations. 
“It’s bigger than us,” Serrano said. “I have support from [my] family when it comes to [finances], but there’s other people that don’t have that privilege.”
Organizations such as Fresh Start and the L.A. Clippers Foundation are providing the food drive with vans. Margarita “Mago” Amador, a food drive volunteer, said the vehicles help the team safely deliver bags to those without forms of transportation, including the senior population.
“It’s our obligation to take care of our elders — they’re the most vulnerable,” Amador said. “They don’t drive, so they don’t have any access to get to the local store, and a lot of them are terrified to even step out of their house. The whole purpose of us doing this is really to make sure that they have the basic food needs.”
According to Acosta, politicians such as California State Assemblymember Miguel Santiago and L.A. City Councilmember Jose Huizar have also offered support and provided tote bags, funds and a construction bin to dispose of the cardboard waste from the packaged food. Grocery stores, including the Chiquita Fresh North America L.L.C. and Porto’s Bakery, have donated food to the drive, and other organizations such as the American Heart Association are also providing supplies. 
In an email to the Daily Trojan, USC Hospitality Assistant Vice President Kris Klinger said USC Hospitality has provided more than 1,800 pounds of food and will continue to donate for as long as the pandemic lasts. 
Acosta said she hopes to expand the food drive to include the homeless population, rendered especially vulnerable to the crisis because they lack shelter to maintain social distancing and avoid close contact. 
“We haven’t been able to really continue to serve our unsheltered and our homeless population because a lot of these initiatives are for families and elders,” Acosta said. “We’re going to add a soup kitchen because if I give a homeless person a bag of groceries, they don’t have a refrigerator, they don’t have a stove, so that’s not really going to work for them.”
For volunteers like Serrano, who has owned a business in Boyle Heights for two years, participating in the food drive has proved to be a positive experience. Even though her business is closed for now, working at the drive allows her to provide aid to her community in a time of crisis while bonding with fellow volunteers.
“You just have this group of people that tend to just now become your family,” Serrano said. “I think it’s the most rewarding: seeing people’s faces with a little bit of hope.”
