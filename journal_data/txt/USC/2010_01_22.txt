The top-ranked USC men’s tennis team begins its season in earnest on Saturday with a doubleheader at Marks Tennis Stadium.
Anticipated · Sophomore Daniel Nguyen and the Trojans finally get the chance to defend their national title this weekend at home. - Brandon Hui | Daily Trojan 
The Trojans begin their day at 10 a.m. facing a Loyola Marymount team that USC beat 7-0 in a dual match last season. The day continues with a 3 p.m. match against UC Santa Barbara, a squad the Trojans swept 4-0 in the NCAA Regionals last spring.
The match opens LMU’s season with its game against the Trojans. The Lions finished last year with a record of 6-19, but they boast the No. 87 ranked singles player, junior Ivan Lopez, and the No. 60 ranked doubles duo of Lopez and sophomore Otto Sauer.
UCSB (1-1) beat St. Mary’s 6-1 to open its season but followed it up with a loss to No. 41 ranked Hawaii 2-5.
The Gauchos have demonstrated strong doubles play so far this season, as the teams of junior Alex Konigsfeldt and senior Josh Finkelstein, junior Evan Jurgensen and senior Scott Hohenstein and freshmen Benjamin Recknagel and Lucas Sudow all are undefeated in 2010.
The weather will prove to be a significant obstacle at the onset of the season. Not only does the threat of rain leave open the possibility of a cancellation of Saturday’s matches, but the torrential downpours of the past few days have severely limited the players’ preparation.
Even though the squad has not practiced on a normal schedule this week, the team is looking  forward to beginning the season with a doubleheader.
Playing two matches back-to-back allows members who are not in the regular rotation to gain valuable playing experience.
“The doubleheader is good for the confidence of everyone on the team. It helps more players get into match rhythm,” senior Robert Farah said.
The doubleheader, along with allowing more members of the team an opportunity to play, also gives the Trojans a chance to maximize their schedule beyond what is normally allotted.
“We have a limit of 25 dates of competition, and this is a chance to play two teams in one while only using one date of competition,“ coach Peter Smith said.
These matches will also provide an opportunity to fix mistakes or rebound from a potentially poor performance.
“If something doesn’t go well in the first match, you can improve on it in the second match,” senior Jason McNaughton said.
For USC, the ultimate goal is to successfully defend its national title, but the team is not getting ahead of itself, as their main goal is to start the season strong.
“These matches are a good opportunity to get the season going with a full head of steam,” McNaughton said.

The Women of Troy stepped it up on the defensive end of the floor in the second half of Thursday night’s game, clawing their way back from an early double-digit deficit to beat the Washington Huskies 69-65.
All-around · Sophomore guard Ashley Corral added six assists to her 19 points in the Women of Troy’s four-point victory over Washington. - Tim Tran | Daily Trojan 
“This game was huge. It was a good win going into Washington State,” junior center Kari LaPlante said.
The first half was closely contested, with several lead changes and ties, until the Huskies started pulling away from the Women of Troy to lead 33-22.
But the Women of Troy battled back and went on an 8-0 run to end the first half and cut the deficit to three points.
At the start of the second half, the Huskies extended their lead to nine points, but again the Women of Troy would not quit.
Sophomore guard Briana Gilbreath was active on the defensive end of the floor for the Women of Troy, finishing with five steals and creating all sorts of problems for the Huskies on offense.
LaPlante stepped up on the offensive end, scoring inside and outside of the paint, and converting a three-play midway through the second half that allowed the Women of Troy to cut the lead to two points.
“I just did what my team needed me to do,” LaPlante said.
For the next couple of minutes, both teams were engaged in a defensive battle until sophomore guard Ashley Corral tied the score at 51 with seven and a half minutes left to play.
But Corral wasn’t done.
She drained two more 3-pointers to extend the lead to nine points, with 4:30 to play.
However, the game wasn’t over.
Turnovers and missed free throws down the stretch almost allowed the Huskies to come back but the Women of Troy managed to secure their victory.
“We knew we were going to win the game,” LaPlante said. “We just needed to step it up on defense.”
Corral, who finished with a game-high 19 points, led a balanced offensive attack for the Women of Troy. Gilbreath and LaPlante chipped in 13 points apiece and senior guard/forward Aarika Hughes  finished with 10 points.
The next game for the Women of Troy is this Saturday, Jan. 23 at Washington State, the Women of Troy’s second game of their northern road trip.
Tip-off is at 2 p.m.

The USC men’s basketball team came out running Thursday night but couldn’t keep it going as Washington State rallied from behind to hand the Trojans a 67-60 loss at the Galen Center.
Tough loss · Senior forward Marcus Johnson fouled out late in the game during the Trojans’ loss. Johnson finished with 16 points. - Tim Tran | Daily Trojan 
USC (11-7, 3-3) led by as many as 15, but the Cougars charged back midway through the second half. Redshirt senior forward Marcus Johnson turned in a productive night, leading the Trojans with 16 points but came up short, with the rest of the team in the final minutes of the game.
Guard Reggie Moore had 21 points and six assists to pace Washington State (14-5, 4-3), and guard Klay Thompson — the nation’s fifth-leading scorer — added 20 points of his own.
“We were very aggressive in the first half defensively,” USC coach Kevin O’Neill said after the game. “I thought we made it tough in the second half. We gave in for the first time in quite a while.”
Just minutes into the second half, it looked like the Trojans were on their way to a blowout. Redshirt junior forward Alex Stepheson scored five straight points before Johnson’s emphatic dunk put USC ahead 41-26.
But the visitors weren’t ready to call it a night. The Cougars proceeded to go on a 12-1 run, with forward Nikola Koprivica’s three-pointer cutting the lead to four with 15:25 to go. Meanwhile, the Trojans’ offense stalled.
“You can’t have both,” said senior forward Dwight Lewis, who finished with 13 points on 5-of -14 shooting. You can’t slack up on defense and not be scoring at the same time. If you do that, it will wind up in a loss like it did tonight.”
A 3-pointer by redshirt senior guard Mike Gerrity halted the Cougars’ surge temporarily. But USC’s vaunted defense, which had entered the game tied for first in the nation in points allowed per game, began to crack.
Even after the Trojans stretched the lead back to eight, Washington State kept coming back. With just under six minutes remaining, the Cougars scored on five straight possessions. Moore’s jumper with 3:17 left gave the road team a 58-55 lead.
“Moore’s a heck of a player,” O’Neill said. “No matter who we put on him, we couldn’t keep in front.”
After Moore made two free throws, another three by Gerrity cut the lead to two and energized a crowd hoping the Trojans would make a comeback of their own.
But that hope was short-lived, as USC just couldn’t convert in the final two minutes and the Cougars closed out the game at the line.
“We just didn’t have a good half defensively,” O’Neill said. “We just collapsed.”
The Trojans won’t have much time to reflect on their second-half meltdown. Washington (12-6, 3-4) comes to town Saturday night for some more Pac-10 action at the Galen Center. Tip-off is scheduled for 7:30 p.m.
“You can dwell on it tonight,” Lewis said of the loss. “But you’ve got to get ready for a good Washington team coming in.”

Well, that’s one way to put it.
After the USC women’s basketball team beat UCLA 70-63 on Sunday, coach Michael Cooper opened the postgame news conference by saying, “My opening statement is, f— UCLA.”
Interesting start · In just his first season as coach of the Women of Troy basketball team, coach Michael Cooper has riled up controversy.  - Tim Tran | Daily Trojan 
Cooper went on to say many more words after that, but — not surprisingly — none seemed to have the same effect as the first sentence.
Many people were taken aback by Cooper’s words, and he promptly apologized for his actions in a letter sent Tuesday to UCLA coach Nikki Caldwell. The Pac-10 issued a reprimand in response to the statement, and it remains to be seen if Cooper will be punished further.
But I, for one, enjoyed the statement.
While the blunt word choice might not have been appropriate, the fiery passion and rivalry that the phrase embodies seems to be one of the only ways to describe the relationship between USC and UCLA. Cooper was visibly excited about the win, as he should be; a win in this matchup seems to rank above most everything else in a coach’s résumé, and to do it in front of a charged-up home crowd is an experience second to none.
So I saw Cooper saying those six words with the intention of displaying how much he, as well as everyone else at USC, cared about the rivalry; not in a malicious spirit but simply a competitive one.
And, to be honest, I didn’t think it was anything new.
Although he is the first one to articulate it so eloquently, Cooper is the last in a long line of USC coaches to make this statement in one form or another during the course of this school year.
Take, for instance, former football coach Pete Carroll, who made his “expletive statement” in the form of some good old football bravado. As you might remember, immediately following a questionable UCLA timeout with the game all-but-over, Carroll decided to take one last shot at the end zone with 44 seconds left in USC’s game against the Bruins on Nov. 28. The result was a 48-yard pass-and-catch from quarterback Matt Barkley to wideout Damian Williams, which put the Trojans up 21 points and caused quite a stir on the sidelines.
“It is just the heart of a competitor — just battling,” Carroll said after the game.
Or how about men’s basketball coach Kevin O’Neill, who led his team into Pauley Pavilion last Saturday and handed the Bruins a 21-point loss — their worst to the Trojans since the 1944-45 season? He made his   “expletive statement” almost silently, not even knowing the record he had broken.
“I wasn’t aware of all the statistics or any of that stuff, but I’m glad I was a part of it,” O’Neill said in the locker room.
Even Jovan Vavic, the coach of USC men’s water polo, gave his  “expletive statement” this season perhaps in the most fitting form of all: pure, hard-nosed competition. His team won its fifth National Championship since 1998 by edging out the Bruins 7-6 in the NCAA title game — a win that put USC up 3-2 in the season series against UCLA and avenged their semifinal loss to the Bruins in the Mountain Pacific Sports Federation championships.
“It is really fitting for these boys to end up on top, to win their last collegiate game and to beat UCLA,” Vavic said.
So while Cooper’s words were not in the right place, one could argue that his heart was. Of course, to properly put that idea into words seems near impossible without drawing scrutiny (and in this case punishment), but Cooper obviously saw it fit to show his enthusiasm — as he should.
A rivalry as intense as USC and UCLA’s feeds on the sold-out crowds, the epic matchups, the incredible finishes and, yes, even the occasional inflammatory statement. It’s a tradition that has been around for the majority of the schools’ existences, and it embodies everything that collegiate athletics stand for.
And there is no doubt in my mind that the feeling is reciprocated fully by our neighbors in blue and gold.

Just like the Southeastern Conference in football and the Big East Conference in men’s basketball, the Mountain Pacific Sports Federation stands alone in men’s volleyball as the premiere division across the country. No other conference has as many national championships, ranked teams or the caliber of competition as the MPSF annually showcases.
Rising star · Junior opposite hitter and team co-captain Murphy Troy, pictured here from last season, helped the Trojans sweep Long Beach State Wednesday night, contributing 20 kills. The Trojans host UC San Diege Friday night. - Daily Trojan file photo. 
So in a year in which the USC men’s volleyball team has held its status as the top team in the land despite a brutal schedule away from home and three tough early conference matchups, the road ahead will continue to challenge the strength and resolve of the Trojans (5-1, 3-0).
That challenge continues tonight as the Trojans welcome No. 12 UC San Diego to the Galen Center, in an inter-conference showdown that marks the seventh straight match USC will face a top 25 opponent.
The Trojans are coming off what was arguably their most impressive and efficient match of the year, after they defeated the No. 8 Long Beach State 49ers with relative ease in three sets (30-28, 31-29, 30-23). Led by junior opposite hitter Murphy Troy’s 20 kills, senior middle blocker Hunter Current’s five blocks and sophomore middle blocker Andrew Pizula’s match-high 12 digs, USC looked the part of a No. 1 team in its home opener.
No. 12 UCSD (2-4, 1-2) is also coming off its most impressive win of the early season, as the team defeated No. 7 Pepperdine in four sets on Wednesday night for its first win against the Waves in school history.
While the Tritons enter this season as one of the youngest teams in the conference, they are led by savvy veterans Frank Fritsch and Calvin Ross. Fritsch, the team’s outside hitter and senior leader, led the team with 366 kills in 2009 while Ross, the team’s top middle blocker, led the Tritons in blocks last season.
So though on paper the advantage of experience tends to lean toward the Trojans in this match, the players know that in every match in the MPSF conference they will be facing the opposing team’s best shot. And tonight’s match against the Tritons is likely to be no different.
“USC always has a target on its back. By having the reputation as a top contending program, every team wants to claim a win against the Trojans,” Current said.
First serve will be at 7 p.m. and will mark just the second time this season the road-weary Trojans will have an opportunity to play in front of their home crowd. The match also marks the last time the team will be in town for the rest of January and the beginning of February, as their upcoming matches are at Pepperdine, Cal State Northridge and Santa Barbara.
