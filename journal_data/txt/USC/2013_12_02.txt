Speaking before a small but intimate crowd at Doheny Memorial Library, USC University Professor and Leo S. Bing Professor of English and American Literature Leo Braudy read excerpts from and discussed his new autobiographical work Trying to be Cool: Growing Up in the 1950s.
Reflection · Professor of English and American Literature Leo Braudy speaks about his book Trying to be Cool: Growing up in the 1950s. – Austin Vogel | Daily Trojan
The event was sponsored by the Friends of USC Libraries. Though few students attended, it was an opportunity for many to reminisce on the past.
“Having grown up in the ’50s there’s a bit of nostalgia,” Paul Kovich, director of undergraduate student services for the USC Department of Political Science, said, “Leo Braudy has a great reputation as an author and a scholar.”
After an introduction from Dean of the USC Libraries Catherine Quinlan, Braudy spoke about the genesis of the book and his attempt to reconcile his own memories with scholarly research.
“[The challenge] was to combine my personal experience with my intellectual experience and have them resonate with each other,” Braudy said.
Braudy said he wanted to maintain the sense of naivete that comes with growing up, while also looking back on the past. He said he first attempted to alternate historical and anecdotal chapters but abandoned that after writing the first few. Instead, he said the book has a “musical structure” with song lyrics serving as titles for all the chapters.
Much of Braudy’s talk dealt with music and the changing dynamics of the music in the 1950s. He spoke about the advent of rock ‘n’ roll and how the radio replaced group singing.
“My mom and dad and their friends, when they were on the bus coming back from [a trip], would sing for hours,” Braudy said. “[That was replaced] by the radio and now the radio with the iPod and headphones.”
He commented on how music in the 1950s was very “regional and ethnic,” noting how songs were often released in certain cities and when he would travel and hear a song, his friends from home wouldn’t have heard it.
Braudy also spoke about the huge social role that dancing played during the ’50s, especially the popular dance “The Bug,” which he said was the culturally accepted way to let loose. He fondly recalled memories of dancing with his friends at various venues around his hometown of Philadelphia.
“Of all the things, the music, the horror movies, the most memorable thing is dancing, the desire to dance and the feeling that dancing gave you,” he said.
Braudy mentioned how the desire to “be cool” drove teens to try and distinguish themselves in whatever way possible, noting that certain groups even had their own kind of shoes. Toward the end of his remarks, Braudy commented on the teenagers of today and noted the contrast between the “rebel without a cause” teenagers of his time and the overscheduled teens of today.
“The open-ended phrase, ‘Go out and play,’ is no longer heard,” he said.
For students, it was a chance to gain a new perspective on history.
“It was exciting and engaging because we all think of the ’50s as old, conservative, sort of the ‘Golden Age,’” said Erica Christianson, a senior majoring in political science. “To hear it told by someone who experienced it made it seem as new and exciting as what we’re going through today.”

Three USC students are developing a weekly web series dubbed “Glass in the Class,” which aims to study the effect of Google Glass on education and show how new technology can improve or detract from learning.
Google Glass are wearable computer-like eyeglasses with a heads-up display. The smart headpiece will be released to consumers in 2014, and the students hope to show universities everywhere what its effects might be.
Michael Cherin, a senior majoring in communication and a spokesperson for the project, said the idea for the web series came out of an assignment in one of Cherin’s communication classes, where he had to speak about a new technology that would change the way people live.
“I decided to do [my presentation] on Google Glass,” Cherin said. “It’s something new, something different that no one really knows much about.”
His focus for the assignment was on Google Glass’ effect in an educational setting. In his research, he said he noticed no one had really tested this innovation in a classroom environment.
“What’s it going to be like in the classroom, are teachers going to accept it? Is it going to benefit, or will teachers see it as a negative effect on learning?” Cherin said. “All these questions I know people are going to want answered, and I wanted to find a way to do it and kind of be the first ones to pioneer in this field.”
The web series will center on the students’ experiences of testing Google Glass in the classroom.
“If I went through one of my communication classes, for example, and I realized [Google Glass] is kind of deterring me from learning and it’s not helping me in that particular situation, whether it’s taking notes or giving a speech in class, the episode would be based around that,” Cherin said.
Cherin noted that, rather than reading a study from a journal, the web series will reach out to people on a personal level.
“You get to see our faces, you get to see the work we’re going through. As a viewer you can connect with us, which is really a good thing,” he said.
So far, three professors from the communication department have agreed to allow the students to test out Google Glass in their classrooms.
Cherin and his team are financing the project through the use of the popular crowd-funding website Kickstarter. On its page, the project is touted as “the first research study about Google Glass and it’s benefits in an educational setting.”
They hope to raise $1,100 by Dec. 27, which Cherin states will go toward the first year of production and the cost of conducting studies.
Students on campus had mixed reactions toward the implementation of Google Glass in the classroom.
Alziz Abdulaziz, a sophomore majoring in business administration, said he saw it as being a potential distraction in a learning environment.
“From what I know, I think it would hurt the classroom as it’s more of a distraction than an actual asset,” Abdulaziz said.
Kevin Matre, a senior majoring in film and television production, believes that it could be useful, but also could infringe on privacy. “I think that it could be really beneficial to help students take notes and keep up with what’s happening in their class, but I think a downside of that is students’ privacy,” Matre said.
Not all students, however, saw the new technology as harmful. Patrick Fritz, a sophomore majoring in film and television production, is excited for the integration.
“I think it would have both [positive and negative effects,] but generally positive,” Fritz said. “I like it when technology is integrated into the classroom and I think it could do a lot of good.”
Cherin said his team’s ultimate goal with “Glass in the Class” is to clear up any confusion toward the possible effects of Google Glass in an educational setting.
“Before it even happens, we don’t want anyone to have to deal with getting kicked out of class for using Google Glass or anything,” Cherin said. “We want a university-wide position of, ‘We’re going to accept it, or we’re not.’”

On Nov. 27, USC Concerts Committee posted a photo on Facebook, supposedly releasing the lineup for Springfest 2014. But the lineup, which included Justin Bieber, Nickelback, Avril Lavigne and Soulja Boy, was a fake.
Stephanie Aristakesian, executive director of Concerts Committee, said she thought students would realize the lineup wasn’t real.
“The Black Eyed Peas [without will.i.am] and Rebecca Black were mentioned so we hoped people wouldn’t take that seriously and realize we were just joking around,” Aristakesian said.
She said the motive behind this humorous post was the fact that some people were upset that the Concerts Committee brought Jason Derulo, an artist with multiple chart-topping hits, to perform at Conquest.
“Our post is a satire festival lineup and a reference to the fact that it is impossible to make everyone happy when booking artists,” Aristakesian said.
The lineup was in part spurred by a social media post that referred to Jason Derulo as “a joke,” The writer listed some artists who students deem worse than the Conquest performer. Some of these were included in the fake Springfest 2014 post, such as Justin Bieber and Rebecca Black.
“Students don’t realize how much work and time the Concerts Committee [executive] board puts into these shows, so reading negative comments really hurts,” Aristakesian said. “The motive behind the post is simple — we felt attacked by the article and wanted to put out a humorous response. When people are waiting for major festival announcements, fake lineups will surface online.”
The fake lineup post reached more than 4,000 likes and 40 shares on Facebook in the first five days it was posted. Aristakesian said students voiced mixed reactions.
“Some people messaged us hoping Justin Bieber was actually coming to play while others dished out their distaste for the lineup, not realizing the post was a joke,” she said.
Springfest 2014 will be held on Saturday, April 5, the date mentioned on the fake lineup post. No artists, however, have been confirmed as performers. Funding for concerts and other Program Board events comes from the student programming fee attached to each student’s tuition.
“We made the post primarily because we want to know every student’s dream Springfest lineup,” Aristakesian said. “We have artists in mind, but it all depends on budget, artist availability, university approval and the appeal to the student body.”
Concerts Committee meetings for the spring semester will take place on Mondays at 8 p.m. in TCC 227.
“All are welcome, so please come and share your ideas with us about who you want to bring to campus,” Aristakesian said.
Many people said they knew that the post was false and a joke, based on the comments on the picture. Mary Stepanyan, a senior majoring in human development and aging, said that she knew it was fake from the beginning.
“It didn’t seem real at all. I didn’t believe it because of certain artists on there, like Rebecca Black,” Stepanyan said.
Eun Ah Cho, a sophomore majoring in biological sciences, also said she knew it was fake once she saw the post.
“The artists did not make the post seem like it is real,” Cho said. “I also thought it is too early for the Concerts Committee to announce what artists will be featured for Springfest.”

Dornsife College of Letters, Arts and Sciences alumni Linda and Harlan Martens donated $1 million to establish the Endowed Director’s Chair for the USC-Huntington Early Modern Studies Institute. The Andrew W. Mellon Foundation donated an additional $1.5 million to the institute.
Peter Mancall, Andrew W. Mellon Professor of the Humanities, vice dean for the humanities and professor of history and anthropology, holds the newly endowed director’s chair.
“Harlan and Linda are great supporters of USC and really stepped up to the challenge,” Mancall told USC News. “Their support relieves us of the day-to-day need to raise funding for institute programming. We conduct a wide range of programs, and this endowment provides the security to enable us to fulfill the promise that the Mellon Foundation saw in us 10 years ago.”
EMSI advances interdisciplinary research on human societies around the world between 1450 and 1850 in history, art history, literature and music. The institute was founded in 2003 and maintains a partnership with the Huntington Library.
“Longtime champions of USC, Linda and Harlan Martens have made an incredible investment that will allow the USC-Huntington Early Modern Studies Institute to pursue the ongoing research and programming for which it has become so widely esteemed,” Dornsife Dean Steve Kay told USC News.
The Martens met at USC and have supported USC financially through contributions including a donation to Martens Plaza, which is in front of Leavey Library. They often take friends to visit Huntington Library.
“Given our tie-in with Huntington Library, this funding opportunity resonated with us,” Harlan Martens told USC News.
As chief attorney of producing operations for Exxon Mobil, Harlan has traveled to 65 countries. His wife commented that USC has had a global effect as a university.
“USC has been near and dear to our hearts our whole lives,” said Linda Martens, a former national president of the National Charity League told USC News. “USC is making a mark not just in Southern California, but across the country and the world. It’s a great pleasure to be a part of it.”

Heading into the 83rd meeting between crosstown rivals USC and UCLA, the focus of the game was mainly on the Trojans and interim head coach Ed Orgeron, with many viewing the game as Orgeron’s opportunity to firmly announce himself as the frontrunner to take over as USC’s permanent head coach after the season’s end.
Nowhere to run · USC redshirt sophomore running back Javorius “Buck” Allen rushed for 123 yards on 20 carries and scored a touchdown, but his fourth quarter fumble sealed the victory for the Bruins. – William Ehart | Daily Trojan
By the end of what would ultimately be Orgeron’s final game, however, the spotlight had undoubtedly shifted to UCLA quarterback Brett Hundley, who turned in a star performance in the Bruins’ 35-14 victory, their second straight win over the Trojans and first win at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum since 1997.
Orgeron resigned on Monday after former Washington head coach Steve Sarkisian was announced as USC’s next head coach.
Hundley finished the game with 18 completions on 27 attempts for 208 yards passing, but the redshirt sophomore did most of his damage with his legs, rushing for 80 yards on 13 carries with two touchdowns.
“He’s a great playmaker,” redshirt senior outside linebacker Devon Kennard said. “We had a great gameplan, but I think it comes down to us missing tackles, and we didn’t execute as well as we can. The coaches put us in a great position. Part of it is him being as good of an athlete as he is, and part of it is us not making the plays we could have made.”
UCLA first struck midway through the first quarter on a 3-yard touchdown run by linebacker/running back Myles Jack, and extended its lead to 14-0 early in the second quarter on a 1-yard run by defensive lineman Eddie Vanderdoes. The early deficit proved to be too much for the Trojans to overcome.
“We started fast on defense, but we weren’t able to convert that to offense,” Orgeron said. “We didn’t move the chains. We felt we got behind a little bit. We played well in spurts, but the sacks really hurt us.”
The UCLA pass rush, led by outside linebacker Anthony Barr and defensive end Cassius Marsh, took advantage of a depleted USC offensive line after junior center Marcus Martin and redshirt junior offensive guard Aundrey Walker left the game in the first half with injuries. Martin suffered what was described as a serious knee injury, and Orgeron reported after the game that Walker had a broken ankle.
Barr and Marsh each finished the game with two sacks, and the Bruins had six overall.
“They did a good job rushing. When you have guys like that who are that big and strong, you’re gonna take some hits,” redshirt sophomore quarterback Cody Kessler said. “Obviously it’s never good when you lose two offensive linemen in the same game. It didn’t change [the playcalling] much. We just didn’t execute.”
Kessler completed 17 out of his 28 pass attempts and threw for 174 yards and one touchdown, but also lost a fumble late in the fourth quarter that ended what little hope remained for the Trojans to come back.
After UCLA scored on its first drive of the second half and extended the lead to 21-7, USC responded with a seven-play, 80-yard drive that ended with a 22-yard touchdown pass from Kessler to redshirt junior tight end Xavier Grimble, and the momentum appeared to be swinging the Trojans’ way.
Immediately following the touchdown, however, USC gave up a 46-yard kickoff return by UCLA return man Ishmael Adams that gave the Bruins good starting field position and led to a 5-yard touchdown run by Hundley.
The USC special teams unit struggled throughout the night, particularly in the punting game. Redshirt sophomore punter Kris Albarado struggled to punt the ball deep into UCLA territory and allowed the Bruins to have good field position for most of the game.
“We knew Ishmael was really good, and we’ve faced some really good kick returners [this year] and we’ve stopped them. Tonight we didn’t,” Orgeron said. “We had a couple of bad punts. We need to correct it and open up the competition. In the past eight weeks, special teams have been lights out. Tonight was not their best game, but overall their body of work was pretty good.”
USC had a chance to cut into UCLA’s lead early in the fourth quarter, but the Trojans’ drive was squandered when redshirt sophomore running back Javorius “Buck” Allen fumbled at the Bruins’ 20-yard line with 13:36 remaining. Allen finished the game with 123 rushing yards on 20 carries and one touchdown, his 11th score in his last five games.
USC’s next two drives ended in a punt and another fumble, this one by Kessler, and UCLA was able to clinch the victory on running back Paul Perkins’ 8-yard touchdown run with under four minutes remaining, making the final score 35-14.
“I’m disappointed, but when I think about the overall view and the expectations, I can’t really be that upset,” junior wide receiver Marqise Lee said. “Obviously I’m upset. We wanted to get this win against UCLA. Overall, I’m just grateful that we actually made it this far and got the opportunity to make it to a bowl game.”
Amid questions about his NFL Draft decision, Lee insisted that he would wait until after the team’s bowl game to make up his mind and would not speculate on what his decision might end up being.
The loss served as the final chapter in Orgeron’s tenure as USC’s head coach, and during his time as head coach the Trojans were able to make an impressive turnaround following a 3-2 start to the season that included an upset victory over Stanford. But losses to Notre Dame and UCLA ultimately proved costly to Orgeron’s candidacy.
“Obviously we are disappointed, especially when you don’t beat UCLA and Notre Dame — that is what a head coach of USC is supposed to do,” Orgeron said. “What the future holds, we don’t know, but I do know this — this group of young men and coaches will always be in my heart. They have grown as a team, and I’m proud of them. Regardless of the situation, we’re Trojans, and we’re going to fight.”

Sophomore defensive end Leonard Williams and junior center Marcus Martin headlined 18 different USC players selected to All-Pac-12 teams that were announced by the conference Monday morning.
Williams and Martin were the only Trojans to earn All-Pac-12 First Team honors on defense and offense, respectively, and redshirt sophomore fullback Soma Vainuku made All-Pac-12 First Team as a special teams player after blocking three punts for USC this season.
Williams was second on the team in sacks (6) and tackles (73), an impressive feat for a defensive lineman. Martin, a three-year starter, was the linchpin of the Trojans’ offensive line before suffering a major knee injury in the team’s regular season finale against UCLA on Saturday.
Redshirt senior outside linebacker Devon Kennard, redshirt junior linebacker Hayes Pullard and redshirt junior safety Dion Bailey represented USC on the conference’s second team defense. Kennard led USC in sacks (9), Pullard was the team’s leading tackler (89) and Bailey led the squad in interceptions (5).
Sophomore wide receiver Nelson Agholor made the second team as a return specialist after returning two punts for touchdowns against California on Nov. 9 and averaging 21.6 yards per return.
Agholor also earned All-Pac-12 Honorable Mention as a wide receiver, along with junior Marqise Lee, who had an injury-plagued 2013 campaign after winning the Biletnikoff Award as the best receiver in the nation in 2012.
Agholor led the team in all receiving categories with 51 receptions, 824 receiving yards and four touchdowns, while Lee had 50 receptions, 673 yards and two touchdowns.
The other offensive players to earn All-Pac-12 Honorable Mention were redshirt sophomore tailback Javorius “Buck” Allen, redshirt sophomore quarterback Cody Kessler, redshirt junior tight end Xavier Grimble, redshirt senior tackle Kevin Graf and sophomore guard Max Tuerk.
Defensive players to earn honorable mention include freshman safety Su’a Cravens, redshirt junior defensive back Josh Shaw, redshirt junior defensive end George Uko and junior defensive end J.R. Tavai. Redshirt sophomore punter Kris Albarado rounded out the honorable mention selections.
The Trojans finished the regular season 9-4 (6-3), good for third place in the Pac-12 South behind Arizona State and UCLA.

As the USC women’s volleyball team finished off its regular season last weekend, freshman outside hitter Ebony Nwanebu capped off one of the most impressive first seasons of all time. With 23 kills last week against conference rivals UCLA and Colorado, Nwanebu led the Women of Troy to two sweeps and also picked up a record sixth Pac-12 Freshman of the Week award.
Upward trend · USC freshman outside hitter Ebony Nwanebu (7) has been named Pac-12 Freshman of the Week six times this year. – Ralf Cheung | Daily Trojan
With her sixth selection, Nwanebu has become the all-time record holder for the award as she surpasses her sophomore outsider hitter teammate Samantha Bricio, who was honored five times last season. Nwanebu has been the model of consistency all year for the Women of Troy — her first selection came exactly three months prior, and she has been honored at least once each month of the season.
Nwanebu’s play this past week was exemplary of her stellar season as she posted double-digit kills in both matches and also contributed to the defensive effort with a total of six digs and three blocks.
Perhaps the most impressive component of Nwanebu’s play is her efficiency. She only committed three errors over the course of two matches and finished with a stellar .426 hitting percentage.
As a testament to Nwanebu’s consistent yearlong play, her season statistics have made her the only outside hitter and the only freshman to rank in the top-10 hitting percentages in the conference with a .354 clip, making her fifth in the Pac-12. Her offensive play will be key for USC as it heads into the NCAA tournament this week and looks to advance out of the first and second rounds at the Galen Center.
Since the award’s inception in 2011, USC players have claimed Freshman of the Week honors on 12 separate occasions. Along with Nwanebu’s six and Bricio’s five honors, current freshman outside hitter Elise Ruddins picked up the award during the week of Sept. 16 after her outstanding performance in the University of San Diego preseason tournament.
Nwanebu and Ruddins will each compete in their first NCAA tournament starting this Thursday at 7:30 p.m. against New Hampshire. The winner of that match will go on to play either Colorado State or Cal State Northridge for the right to move on to the regional round.

Following a heartbreaking 10-9 overtime loss against their crosstown rivals from UCLA to conclude the regular season, the USC men’s water polo team entered the Mountain Pacific Sports Federation conference tournament in the unfamiliar role of reeling underdog.

“Reeling” might seem like a dramatic exaggeration for a team that has just four losses on the year and is ranked in the top five. But the five-time national champions are not accustomed to losing big games, which they have done multiple times this season in defeats to Pacific, Stanford and UCLA.
Nevertheless, the squad made up for all of that and regained its familiar favorite status with a powerful run through the MPSF tournament, clinching the conference title on Sunday with a vigorous 10-8 win over rival Stanford.
USC (26-4) entered the game ranked fourth nationally while Stanford (21-5) possessed the No. 2 position. The Trojans had upended top-ranked Pacific in the semifinals with a dominant 18-13 win, but still needed one more win to assure themselves of a spot in the six-team NCAA tournament.
USC did just that, avenging its 17-16 overtime loss suffered at the hands of the Cardinal a few weeks ago at home.
Senior driver Nikola Vavic led the charge in his final MPSF tournament game with two goals, enabling USC’s offense to spread the scoring wealth among eight different players. Freshman two-meter Jon Walters was the only other player to net multiple goals for the Trojans.
“You can’t just focus on one player and hope to stop us,” head coach Jovan Vavic said of his squad.
After falling behind quickly 1-0, the Trojans struck back with a goal of their own from senior two-meter Jeremy Davie before adding on two more to take a 3-1 lead at the end of the first period.
The Trojans utilized some excellent cage play from senior goalie James Clark, who notched 16 saves, before Vavic’s second goal of the match let USC take a 6-3 lead into halftime.
Stanford came out of the half strong and cut the deficit to two goals, but USC refused to wilt. The Trojans responded with a three-goal surge to go up 9-4 before the third period ended, letting Clark finish the job en route to yet another MPSF championship.
The conference title turned out to greatly benefit the Trojans in terms of seeding for the NCAA Tournament — USC was announced on Monday as the No. 1 overall seed, putting them in prime position for a run at an unprecedented sixth straight national championship.
The Trojans will face either No. 4 seed UC San Diego (14-13) or No. 5 seed St. Francis College Brooklyn (22-10) in the semifinals.
No. 2 Pacific is the other squad to receive a bye into the semifinals, and will face the winner of the matchup pitting No. 3 Stanford against No. 6-seeded Whittier College.
The pressure will surely mount for USC next week at the NCAAs, but the high-pressure environment is something every player and coach signed up for.
“Being a Trojan means from the start that the other team is out of its game already,” Davie said.
That confident attitude will be extremely important if the Trojans are to capture that elusive sixth ring, as teams will be licking their fingers at the chance to end mighty USC’s historic run and send them home empty-handed.
The play-in game to determine USC’s first opponent will take place on Thursday, and the semifinals and championship match will be played on Saturday and Sunday, respectively, in Palo Alto, Calif.

In January 2010, then-Athletic Director Mike Garrett offered the job of head football coach to a former USC assistant after the departure of Pete Carroll. Steve Sarkisian, who a little over one year earlier had been named the head coach at Washington, declined the offer, insisting that he felt uneasy about leaving Seattle after just one season.
On Monday, the timing was apparently just right, as Sarkisian was announced as the Trojans’ next leading man.
Sarkisian’s history with USC dates back to his college days when he briefly was a member of the USC baseball team in the fall of 1992 before transferring to El Camino Junior College. He coached quarterbacks at USC from 2001 to 2003 and 2005 to 2006 before being promoted to assistant head coach and offensive coordinator from 2007 to 2008.
For most of his tenure at USC, former head coach Lane Kiffin worked alongside Sarkisian on the offensive coaching staff. From 2005 to 2006, Kiffin served as the team’s passing game and offensive coordinator, while Sarkisian coached quarterbacks, and the two have remained close friends since their time together at USC. Kiffin made his first media appearance following his firing from USC on ESPN’s College GameDay pregame show in Seattle, and reportedly stayed at Sarkisian’s house to watch the Washington-Oregon game.
Sarkisian’s friendship with Kiffin should not be held against him when evaluating his hiring. Kiffin’s name might be considered toxic around the USC program, but Sarkisian is very different from Kiffin, both in terms of personality and coaching philosophy.
Kiffin’s main shortcoming was his inability to connect with the Trojan fanbase and local media. His aloof and sometimes off-putting demeanor didn’t win him many supporters once the losses started to pile up. In contrast, Sarkisian is outgoing and fiery. He has the communication skills to deal with the Los Angeles media in a much more effective way than Kiffin did during his three-plus seasons at USC.
As far as offensive styles, Kiffin and Sarkisian are vastly different, despite their shared career beginnings. Under Kiffin, USC used a pro-style system, operating mostly under center and using at least one tight end or fullback on the field at all times (though seldom utilizing either as a pass catcher).
Kiffin was reluctant to use an up-tempo attack, both as a matter of personal preference and as a result of his roster’s low numbers, rationalizing that running more plays on offense would lead to more injuries. In his three full seasons, USC had only one running back finish the year with 1,000 rushing yards.
Sarkisian’s Washington teams have looked more like contemporary college offenses. The Huskies use a spread offense with multiple-receiver looks and mostly operate out of the shotgun. This season, Sarkisian opted to use a no-huddle approach that has been very effective, with Washington ranking second and third in the Pac-12 in total and scoring offense, respectively. The Huskies have produced a 1,000-yard rusher in all five seasons of Sarkisian’s tenure.
Other critics of Sarkisian’s hire will point to a plethora of other reasons why he is not fit to be the face of the USC football program — prior to this season, his Washington teams never eclipsed the seven-win mark, he has no other head coaching experience and his hire will not be viewed as a “big splash” move that many feel USC needed to make in light of the past two seasons’ struggles. Just five years after being the dominant team in the Pac-12 and one of the most successful programs in the country, USC isn’t even the best team in its own city, with UCLA now holding that title after winning two in a row in the Battle for Los Angeles.
But making a big-name hire is not Haden’s job — his job is to hire the person he thinks will best lead the Trojans into the post-NCAA sanctioned future, and he clearly believes Sarkisian is that person. The sanctions left the USC football program in disarray, and through the efforts of Kiffin and former interim head coach Ed Orgeron, who resigned on Monday after Sarkisian was hired, the Trojans appear ready to move on from a difficult four-year period.
Sarkisian inherited a Washington program in 2009 that was in an even worse position than USC was in following the NCAA sanctions. In 2008, the Huskies went 0-12, and after improving to 5-7 in his first year, Sarkisian has qualified for a bowl game each year since. This year’s eight wins are tied for the most for Washington since 2000, when the Huskies went 11-1 and won the Rose Bowl.
These results are not earth shattering, but it says something about Sarkisian’s ability to get good results quickly. Perhaps with USC’s resources, brand recognition and location in talent-rich Southern California, Sarkisian will be able to eventually have the Trojans competing for conference and national championships again.
It’s difficult, though, for anyone to call Haden’s decision to hire Sarkisian a bust this early. Every other reported candidate for the USC job — Orgeron, Jon Gruden, Chris Petersen and James Franklin, to name a few — had their fair share of flaws. Orgeron could be dismissed as a flash in the pan after a successful eight-game stretch to end the season. Gruden hasn’t coached since 2008 and has virtually no college coaching experience. Petersen has never been a coach at a big-time program, and while Franklin’s Vanderbilt teams have won 17 games over the past two seasons, the Commodores have yet to knock off any of the SEC’s top programs.
Immediately following any coaching hire, the easiest thing to do is to pick apart the flaws in the decision, and this one is no different. Fans like to believe that USC should compete for national championships each year, but those expectations were simply unrealistic in the past four seasons. Though the program is still in somewhat of a transitional phase, Sarkisian has dealt with worse in his brief coaching career, and with a roster full of players who have now had to endure two midseason coaching changes, his familiarity with the USC program will serve him well in minimizing what could be an awkward acclimation period in the wake of Orgeron’s departure.
Given the relatively healthy state of the USC program compared to when Kiffin took over, Sarkisian might have all the tools he needs to complete the Trojans’ resurgence as a national power.

The USC football head coach search is over — and once again, the Trojans will be led by a disciple of former head coach Pete Carroll. Former Washington head coach Steve Sarkisian, who oversaw the development of two Heisman Trophy-winning quarterbacks under Carroll alongside former USC head coach Lane Kiffin, has accepted the position and will replace interim head coach Ed Orgeron.

Despite widespread fan support for Orgeron that was slightly tempered after a season-ending 35-14 loss to UCLA, Athletic Director Pat Haden decided to hire Sarkisian, 39, after the former USC offensive coordinator compiled a 34-29 record (24-21 in the Pac-12) in five years at Washington.
Sarkisian interviewed with Haden over the weekend, and Haden confirmed that Sarkisian was offered the job Monday morning and promptly accepted.
“We are delighted to welcome Steve Sarkisian back to the Trojan Family,” said Haden, who will hold a press conference at 2 p.m. on Tuesday in the John McKay Center to formally introduce Sarkisian. “We conducted a very exhaustive and thorough search, pinpointing about 20 candidates and interviewing five of them. We kept coming back to Sark.”
It was reported earlier by multiple media outlets that Texas A&M head coach Kevin Sumlin and Denver Broncos defensive coordinator Jack Del Rio had been interviewed by USC earlier this fall, in addition to Orgeron and Sarkisian. Sources tell the Daily Trojan that former Tampa Bay Buccaneers coach Jon Gruden was the fifth candidate to be interviewed.
Sarkisian was an assistant coach for the Trojans for seven years, including two years as the offensive coordinator for Carroll. During his time at USC, Sarkisian tutored two Heisman Trophy quarterbacks in Matt Leinart and Carson Palmer, and the Trojans held a 22-3 record when he called the plays.
“I am extremely excited to be coming home to USC and for the opportunity that USC presents to win championships,” Sarkisian said. “I can’t wait to get started.”
Meanwhile, Orgeron, who guided the Trojans to a 6-2 record following the dismissal of Kiffin, said he is leaving USC to pursue head coaching opportunities.
“I am grateful to the University of Southern California for the great time I had here,” Orgeron said. “I am especially proud of this year’s team and coaching staff, who had to start a new season and then bonded, played together as a family and competed like Trojans.”
Haden reportedly offered Orgeron a pay raise and a position on the staff as assistant head coach, but the former defensive line coach and recruiting coordinator was reportedly “outraged” at being passed over for the head coaching gig, according to ESPN’s Brett McMurphy. Orgeron will leave Troy after overseeing a second-half run that featured a massive upset of then-No. 5 Stanford that reinvigorated USC’s fan base.
“[Orgeron] understandably was disappointed when I told him we were going in a different direction,” Haden said. “We talked about the possibility of him remaining at USC, but Ed wants to be a head coach and I am supportive of that.”
After staunchly supporting Orgeron throughout his tenure, USC’s players will have to rebound and play under new leadership. It has yet to be announced if Sarkisian or another current USC coach will lead the Trojans into their pending bowl game.
During his tenure in Seattle, Sarkisian was noted for his excellent recruiting skills across the West Coast, a skill that made him a very attractive option for USC. In 2008, the Huskies finished 0-12, and Sarkisian impressed the nation one year later by leading Washington to a respectable 5-7 in his first year on the job. The Huskies’ eight victories this year were tied for the most at UW since 2000.
Sarkisian’s contract with USC spans five years, according to Los Angeles Daily News’ Scott Wolf. He will be immediately tasked with reconstructing the Trojans’ offense, potentially with freshman quarterback Max Browne, whom he recruited heavily to play for the Huskies.
The Trojans have struggled to regain their status as an offensive juggernaut that they held while under the tutelage of Carroll, Sarkisian and Kiffin in the mid-2000s. Washington was ranked No. 8 in the nation offensively this year, averaging more than 500 yards per game, while USC was ranked No. 80 with 392.3 yards per game.
Vanderbilt head coach James Franklin and Boise State head coach Chris Petersen were also reportedly top candidates, with both having shown the prowess to guide programs to unprecedented success.
But in choosing Sarkisian, Haden decided to invest in the future of USC football by maintaining a link to the past.
Sarkisian was expected to have his first meeting with USC players at 7 p.m. on Monday night, according to Bruce Feldman of CBS Sports.

My first reaction was kind of numb, thinking that Coach O was not staying after saving our 2013 season. I will still miss him as will thousands of Trojan fans, students and players. To me Coach O was like this generations MARV GOUX. If you are not old enough to know who Marv Goux was, he was an assistant coach at USC for decades starting with John McKay in the early 1960’s. He was a defensive line coach an inspirational leader of this coaching staff. Goux was an All American football player at USC in the early 1950’s. He never wanted to be the head coach, he seemed to enjoy his position at this university and was one of the most respected coaches of his time. I look at Coach O as this generations Coach Goux, his leadership and passion and inspiration resurrected this program in the middle of the season, This is something an old Trojan will never forget, We will miss Coach O but this university will continue to prosper and the football program will return to a great level again. I know this because I have seen this since the mid 1950’s myself. We will get past this lack of scholarships in one more year. Sark will recruit the local talent and have success. Just sit back and watch as this all progresses. I have seen this too many times for decades, so just see as things unfold.  And it is possible that UCLA may lose Coach Mora to his Alma Mater, the University of Washington. That was and may still be HIS DREAM JOB!
The Husky nation would also like the trojans to extend Haden’s contract.  Hours before Sark’s announcement, he emphatically lied to a Seattle radio station and said that he was not going to change jobs.  And, to leave the kids he recruited just 3 weeks before their bowl game?  Couldn’t wait???  
Congratulations mr haden…. You’ve managed to bring Lane Kiffin back.  Different name, same standards, same class…
SC remains to be a joke in sports with the obvious continuing of their racist hiring practices in the athletic department!!! Coach O wasn’t white (right)/ Jewish enough for The racist Orange County/South Bay alumni lead by Sir Pat Haden/Princess J.K. Mackay. This was the full Monty White Boy Shuffle (a real book) taking place, and with Coach O having Louisiana  (Swamp) roots he was’nt the right kind to lead the Mothership!!!
It’s  damn there 2014, SC/Pat Haden/ Steve Lopes and company need to stop the overt racist conduct that remains to ooze from their athletic program, and their hiring practices! It time to reach out to the NCAA regarding violations that folks in the community have knowledge of…Victory to the Bruins, again!!!
The Bruin nation would like to thank Pat Haden for not hiring Coach O! What a leader ED is! What a recruiter!
Please extend Pat Haden’s contract, as we look forward to a decade of domination!
Keep dreaming Steve. It took USC losing 30 scholarships for UCLA to win at USC’s house for the first time in 16 years. I doubt when USC is full strength again they will be so easily beat. UCLA like all California public universities is broke. USC has $$$ out the ass. USC will be back on top in LA in a couple years and UCLA will resume their usually pouting.

With Hanukkah already underway and Christmas just around the corner, it’s officially the season of giving. But even if this is the case, some folks in the tech industry aren’t as willing to relinquish some of their cash.
Silicon Valley is an affluent community: The average Silicon Valley tech professional makes roughly $101,278, and homes in the area cost an average of more than $1 million. Of the top 10 corporations that gave the most money to charities in 2012, however, not one of them was a tech company.
Not all tech companies, of course, can afford to give that much money to charity. Wells Fargo & Company, which topped this list, gave more than $300 million in cash last year. Most tech-based startups dream of being acquired for that sum — but it doesn’t help that there are prominent tech industry executives out there who have very high-profile, profligate spending habits.
One such executive is Sean Parker. Aside from co-founding file-sharing service Napster and serving as the first president of Facebook, Parker also made the headlines a couple of months ago with his $10 million wedding. But it wasn’t just the amount of money that he spent that made this wedding infamous — Parker paid an extra $2.5 million to the California Coastal Commission so he could change existing roads and campsites and modify the existing habitat and trees to his liking. Ironically enough, Parker is also the founder of Causes.com, a service that uses social media to connect charities with their supporters and potential donors.
Let’s not forget the lavish birthday party that Yammer CEO David Sacks threw for himself in 2012. Quoted by Business Insider to have cost roughly $1.4 million, the party was held in a $125 million mansion and included entertainment from Snoopzilla (then Snoop Lion). As if all this weren’t enough, the French-themed party’s invitations asked guests to “Let [Sacks] Eat Cake,” a cold-hearted nod to Marie Antoinette’s “empathetic” words to 18th-century French peasantry.
Despite these stories of ludicrous displays of wealth in Silicon Valley, these parties usually go on behind closed doors because these tech executives still have professional reputations to uphold.
But in an environment that’s constantly wired and bombarded with numbers and data, patience runs short. The more visible the progress and the more frequent the updates, the better. This explains why there are many tech millionaires out there who give their money not to charities, but to startup founders that need funding.
Entrepreneurs that have accrued many years’ worth of experience can usually identify which startups have potential on pitch and demo days. These entrepreneurs sometimes invest their money into these projects. No, these entrepreneurs are not donating their time and money to help people get off the streets nor are they donating canned goods to those in need. By investing in a business, product or service, entrepreneurs instead buy in to a cause and hope to play a part in success -— something visible. With donations, on the other hand, there’s no real end and progress is slow, at best. Given the choice between lending a hand to a cause where attaining a goal is much more tangible as opposed to helping out a charity where there is always constant need for something — be it money, clothes or food — there’s more personal motivation and satisfaction with the former choice.
But the call to action for actual philanthropy in Silicon Valley is getting louder.
Omakase Charity is an up-and-coming San Francisco-based organization that makes charity more tech-exec friendly. Omakase, the Japanese phrase for “leave it to you,” lets people decide how much to donate, and the service does the rest of the work by deciding which organizations would benefit most from the donation.
And remember when there weren’t any tech companies in the list of top 10 most charitable companies in 2012? This year, Google snagged the 10th spot by donating more than $100 million in cash and $1 billion in products.
For philanthropy to fit in with Silicon Valley culture, charity organizations should have their own Kickstarter-type projects, where goals are made clear and distribution of charitable funds is spelled out. Updates from these organizations would make backers feel closer and keep them well-informed.
Companies and startups can start their own fundraisers for causes they’re more passionate about. Google, for example, sponsors scholarships for minorities and those with disabilities who are pursuing computer science-related degrees.
There’s no doubt that Internet-based startups are becoming one of the biggest industries in the world — but the time has come for top executives of the industry to stop giving in to lavish luxuries and start giving back in a way that can impact the world as much as their products do.

It’s 2 o’clock in the morning on a Saturday. The lights of restaurants and stores illuminate Fairfax Avenue as people meander through the streets looking for a quick bite to eat in order to complete their night out with friends. The familiar sights, sounds and smells of bars and pubs such as Rosewood Tavern and The Dime fill the air, but a new joint with a brightly lit sign catches the eye of a young couple, prompting them to check out the new ’50s meets indie blast from the past, Twins Sliders, Milkshakes and Fries.
Fry fail · Much of Twins Sliders’ food draws comparisons to In-N-Out, but the Hollywood burger eatery fails to match the chain’s freshness. – Alegra Hueso | Daily Trojan
Twins Sliders likes to keep things simple. The front entrance of the restaurant conjures life from a time filled with doo-wops and soda shops, but the interior says elementary school playground with fiberglass tables and benches. The argument might be that the restaurant meets present day “hipster” and “indie” standards, especially with bumper and urban designer stickers lining the walls of the joint, but what ever happened to bringing back the classics?
Twins Sliders offers one of the simplest menus in Los Angeles, serving up two kinds of sliders — classic cheeseburger with onions or fried spicy Cajun chicken. They offer house cut fries also known as “shoestrings” in either their original form, cheesed up or “dirty,” and milkshakes — classic vanilla, strawberry, chocolate and the original date shake. To top off the menu, Twins Sliders has a 40-ounce loaded shake, called The Big One.
Everything on the Twins Sliders menu is made fresh daily and the ingredients don’t have any preservatives or additives, so customers can feel good about ordering calorie-laden comfort food.
Their sliders are supposed to bring back a nostalgia of a time long past, but if anything, the cheeseburger with onions slider is something very similar to another SoCal favorite: the In-N-Out “Animal Style” Cheeseburger. Granted, it is hard to mess up a cheeseburger with caramelized onions and Thousand Island dressing, and it is a delicious combination enjoyed by all, but why pay for a mini In-N-Out burger when you can go to In-N-Out and get a normal-sized burger for the same price?
The chicken slider is a good burger but doesn’t live up to its name. The spicy fried Cajun chicken slider has more originality than its beefy counterpart, but for claiming to be spicy, it’s not.
Every great burger joint needs a good fry, but unfortunately Twins Sliders has soggy shoestrings. The Cheesy Shoestrings came highly recommended by a server, and fooled a familiar Daily Trojan beat writer into thinking that the cheese itself would be something tasty and similar to our local Freebird’s queso. Instead, the cheese tasted like it came straight from a can that could be found in any local grocery store and warmed up in the microwave. The fries were overcooked and unappetizing, with a consistency similar to that of overcooked noodles. The dirty fries, like their cheeseburger slider, eerily resemble In-N-Out’s Animal Style Fries. The two things Twins Sliders has to set them apart from competitive burger chains are its shakes and its hours.
Twins Sliders is a recent addition to the popular Fairfax nightlife scene and on weekends is open until 2:30a.m., bringing in customers for a post-midnight treat.
Twins Sliders’ shakes embody what every great milkshake should have — thick consistency, but just thin enough to drink through a straw and simple, enjoyable ingredients. The Date Shake and The Big One are set to be especially big hits. The Date Shake has three ingredients: vanilla ice cream, dates and milk. The Big One is a different entity unto itself and is sure to make lactose intolerant and calorie-conscious run the opposite direction, but for those who like a larger-than-life challenge, The Big One is the way to go. Containing practically everything but the kitchen sink in the mix, The Big One is an excellent dessert to share with friends and even comes with a whole Twinkie as a garnish.
Owner George Abou-Daoud, a Los Angeles restauranteur known for having very successful restaurants in Hollywood, East Hollywood and down Sunset Boulevard, seems to have lowered his standards for good quality food and originality. The location he chose for his new joint is brilliant — replacing his previous restaurant Urban Garden and next door to one of his more popular bars, Rosewood Tavern — but might be too close to similar burger restaurants such as In-N-Out and The Oinkster.
If you pay a visit to the latest blast from the past restaurant — chances of disappointment aren’t too far fetched, but at least your stomach will be satisfied, and the shakes are terrific.

Coming off the heels of her 32nd birthday, Britney Spears is continuing with the winning dance-music formula from 2011’s Femme Fatale.
Doing “Work” · Spears’ new album Britney Jean brings out her human side, making the pop princess more relatable than ever to her fanbase. – Courtesy of RCA Records
Spears’ last album produced three top-10 singles with “I Wanna Go,” “Hold It Against Me” and “Till The World Ends.” All three songs were successful collaborations with will.i.am, who executive produced Britney Jean. Will.i.am and Spears crank out more upbeat, dance-style and electronic dance music-inspired tracks on the new album, showing Spears’ attraction to the club music scene.
Britney Jean also serves as a transitional album for Spears. Some tracks explore modern EDM and dubstep territory, while other tracks recall the sounds of Spears’ past. By mixing up styles but still staying true to her fundamental musical persona, Spears delivers an album that is strong overall, proving that she still has plenty of ideas for fresh material.
The strength of the album is only slightly affected by the confusion that results on some tracks due to the overwhelming use of auto-tune and EDM sounds, but the strongest tracks have enough impact to stand successfully above the weaker ones.
The months leading up to the album’s release have been fairly leaky — the two singles “Work B—h” and “Perfume” were leaked online days before their intended releases in mid-September and early November, respectively. Likewise, a low-quality version of “Alien” and 30-second snippets of the entire album went viral within several days of each other in late November.
“Work B—h” is a typical Spears-will.i.am collaboration that follows in the footsteps of the Femme Fatale tracks. Co-produced by will.i.am and Swedish House Mafia’s Sebastian Ingrosso, the song is clearly EDM-inspired and geared toward countless club remixes, with a pulsating beat and electronic sound. The message is pure Britney Spears as well, with a chorus that says, “You want a hot body / You want a Bugatti / You want a Maserati / You better work b—h,” by which Spears seems to be speaking to her hard work as the reason for her success.
Not a bad message, Brit, and one that can certainly be appreciated in a society increasingly obsessed with overnight success stories.
The message in “Perfume” is also timely, as are her vocals, which shine through without the excessive auto-tuning that her will.i.am-produced numbers often exhibit. Her second single, released in early November, reveals a more vulnerable side of Spears that her electro-pop dance songs keep hidden as “Perfume” discusses fears of her man seeing another woman.
The song has a great progression, starting out delicately as Spears expresses insecurities and slowly building as she gathers strength and shows off some pretty good vocals with lyrics that say, “I put on my perfume / I want it all over you / I’m gonna mark my territory.”
Inspired by 1980s power ballads, this cool, modern pop ballad, strengthened by her stripped-down vocals, is nostalgic, beckoning memories of the “Stronger” and “Lucky” Spears of the past. “Perfume” has substance to it and is refreshing and powerful, especially standing next to the upbeat and light electro-pop tracks.
Britney Jean also emphasizes exposure in “Alien,” which likewise makes a strong impact without going the electro-pop route. Spears’ voice once again takes center stage and the lyrics are at once boldly confident and airily celestial — “There was a time when I was one of a kind” and “The stars in the sky look like home / Take me home / And the light in your eyes lets me know I’m not alone.”
The song’s lyrics again exhibit a more vulnerable Spears exploring new territory. The sound strikes a more reflective tone than typical Spears material.
A notable and strong Britney Jean track that did not fall victim to the leaky pre-release period is “Tik Tik Boom” featuring T.I. Not to be confused with the similarly named Ke$ha track, Spears’ song is like a slowed-down club jam that shows off her vocals and boasts a strong beat. The background instrumentals and electronic undertones hint toward EDM style without letting it overwhelm the track. T.I.’s portion of the song is also strong and complements Spears’ vocals. “Tik Tik Boom” appears to be the front runner for radio success at this point.
A few of the album’s tracks should follow “Work B—h” and find success in the club scene. “It Should Be Easy” features will.i.am, whose vocals actually overshadow Spears’, and makes that track near a duplicate of the duo’s 2012 “Scream and Shout” collaboration. The song will most likely spawn countless remixes, however, her other EDM track “Body Ache” probably will as well.
“Til It’s Gone” features slower verses and an explosive dupstep chorus that give the song a more impactful sound than the aforementioned two by highlighting Spears’ vocals in the verses and creating a playful dance tone with the EDM chorus. One of the better of the EDM songs, this track strengthens Spears’ venture into various styles.
Overall, Britney Jean makes a strong statement that Spears is taking on new challenges and exploring new varieties of music. The album has a smattering of different styles from EDM to ’80s-inspired ballads that simultaneously show the strong, confident Spears that everyone knows and loves while also revealing a lesser-known Spears with insecurities. Spears is one of those rare and lasting people who has been able to endure the constant stream of pop “it” girls and still has something to say.
Britney Jean humanizes Spears and proves to listeners that she is not only still the pop persona that fans have seen on stage for more than 15 years, but perhaps also a real woman with a lot more to say.

The USC men’s basketball team traveled to the Bahamas for the Battle 4 Atlantis tournament, looking to continue their four-game winning streak out of the country. But that hope would be extinguished quickly, with the Trojans suffering a 94-79 loss to Villanova and a 77-63 defeat to Wake Forest. USC would, however, secure seventh place in the eight-team tournament with an 84-78 win over Xavier on the final day.
Senior guard Pe’Shon Howard led the way for the Trojans in the tournament, averaging 17.7 points, 3.3 assists, and 3.3 rebounds over the three-game stretch. Junior guard Byron Wesley averaged 14 points and 6.7 rebounds per game.
The tournament yielded action before any games even tipped off – head coach Andy Enfield and UTEP coach Tim Floyd had to be separated following a heated exchange at a welcome banquet. Floyd had accused USC in July of committing recruiting violations, after Isaac Hamilton rescinded his commitment from the Miners and instead chose to play at UCLA. Enfield had
“Tim Floyd shows up every day at work and realizes he lives in El Paso, Texas,” Enfield said in the December issue of Men’s Journal, setting the stage for the coaches’ confrontation. “And he’s pissed off that he didn’t get the USC job two months ago. I told him, ‘Tim, if I could have all this power to somehow convince a family to do this, why the heck didn’t the kid come last spring, when I first got the job?'”
The two coaches didn’t get the chance to realize their rivalry on the court, as USC and UTEP didn’t meet in the Battle 4 Atlantis. The Miners finished fourth in the tournament.
USC arrived in the Bahamas riding a four-game winning streak, all of which came at home, and appeared to be headed in the right direction under Enfield. Their hopes of beating Villanova, however, slowly dwindled from the start, as the Wildcats staked out an early lead and never trailed.
James Bell scored 17 points to lead five double-digit scores as the Wildcats (7-0), the eventual tournament champion, set a Battle 4 Atlantis record with 94 points. Howard led USC with a game-high 23 points and 3 steals, Wesley recorded 15 points and 10 rebounds, and freshman forward Roschon Prince added 13 points and 8 rebounds off the bench.
The loss set up a match against Wake Forest (6-2) in the consolation bracket, where a 41-25 halftime deficit proved too much for USC to overcome. Coron Williams led the Demon Deacons with 15 points, as the team shot 53 percent from the field. Wesley led the way with 12 points for the Trojans, which ran into trouble from behind the arc, missing 15 of their first 16 3-point attempts. Prince and Howard added 10 points each.
The Trojans were able to salvage their trip to the Bahamas on Saturday, picking up an 84-78 win over Xavier to clinch seventh place in the tournament. Howard scored 23 points for the second game in the tournament to go along with seven assists. Wesley finished with 15 points and seven rebounds, while freshman guard Julian Jacobs tallied 14 points, seven assists, seven rebounds, and three steals. USC took the lead during a 31-11 run over 12 minutes spanning both halves, then held off the Musketeers (5-3) to earn the win.
Semaj Christon led Xavier with 21 points, seven assists, and four steals. Myles Davis scored 16 points, while Matt Stainbrook added 14 points and six rebounds.
USC will look to stay undefeated at the Galen Center under Enfield, as they prepare to face Boston College (3-4) on Sunday at 4 pm.

It’s clear from the talk around campus that many students are anticipating the replacement of Carl’s Jr. with The Habit next semester. To promote this exciting change, The Habit’s food truck visited campus on Dec. 2 to give out free burgers and fries. Though this event was an overwhelming success, there are things that can still be changed about the food options at USC.
But what many students may not know is that they have a direct impact on their on-campus dining choices, especially through USG committees such as University Affairs, which works directly with USC Hospitality to improve the undergraduate experience.
We currently have an online survey circulating in the hopes of achieving this goal of bettering our food options. Earlier this year, Wahoo’s Fish Tacos, which was located in the Ronald Tutor Campus Center, was replaced with Verde, a Chipotle-style burrito bar. This addition has received many positive reviews. Furthermore, at the beginning of this year, Traditions — more commonly known as Traddies — changed their menu to include fun country style food options. Though dining halls might seem discouraging with their repetitive menus, options such as Traddies offer a fun alternative.
If you’re still not satisfied, it’s important to note that change is possible. In our survey, we specifically have a section for students to add any feedback.
In the past, we have heard from students that providing an eating area with tables and chairs at the Farmers’ Market would be nice so that students have a place where they can eat their food in the quad. We have heard from multiple students that the addition of music would help create a more fun atmosphere, but unfortunately we have tried and the university does not allow music in the quad given its close proximity to libraries, classrooms and residential halls.
But we’re not going to stop at surveys. We want you to get involved directly in a USG committee such as University Affairs because we are constantly looking to the students and want to remain as transparent and open as possible. This way, University Affairs can continue to work with USC Hospitality in making sure every student at USC is having the best dining experience possible.
We want students to be able to voice their opinions, so please take a moment if you haven’t already to fill out the survey, and do not hesitate to reach out and email me or my assistant director Jennifer Glaeser (amenard@usc.edu, Glaeserj@usc.edu) for any improvements or suggestions you may have.

Thanksgiving has come and gone, but plates of leftover turkey and pumpkin pie still linger in the fridge, awaiting their trip to the trash. So it should be no surprise that during the holiday season, food waste piles up in the background.
Alan Hung | Daily Trojan
 
Some restaurants take food waste very seriously and have implemented a policy where diners at all-you-can-eat buffets are charged for uneaten food. Though some criticize these restaurants, these businesses show a legitimate concern for the environment.
Food waste has become a major problem in the United States. According to the Los Angeles Times, almost 40 percent of the nation’s food supply gets thrown out annually. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency documented that in 2011, more than 36 million tons of food waste reached landfills, taking up 21 percent of the nation’s municipal solid waste.
Moreover, roughly one-third of all food produced for human consumption is lost or wasted each year, according to Worldwatch Institute. Consumers in countries such as the United States waste 222 million tons of food, an equivalent to the food produced in all of sub-Saharan Africa, according to Worldwatch. But in the end, world hunger isn’t vanishing anytime soon.
In response to this crisis, restaurants have stepped up, but for those such as Silverlake’s Gobi Mongolian BBQ House who have been charging diners for uneaten food, the feedback from consumers has been negative.
One Yelp reviewer called the new policy a “transparent spin, which is obviously about their profit margin,” suggesting that the business doesn’t want to spend more money on buying food. He went on to write, “If they were sincerely concerned about this they would allow you to take uneaten food to go, so it does not get wasted.”
The policy this reviewer describes, which allegedly prohibits diners from packing leftovers, only applies during all-you-can-eat nights. It’s a reasonable measure considering that no other buffets usually allow their customers to take home their food either. It deters customers from preparing entire bowls of food to pack up, a situation that would cause the business to lose food as well as take an economic blow.
To keep the spirit of all-you-can-eat meals while still discouraging wasting, an extra fee on uneaten food seems reasonable. Besides, whenever people pay for a buffet, the tacit agreement is that it’s only worth the money if the diners can truly eat their hearts out and not waste. Those who cannot eat their fill should be prepared to lose a bit of the fixed fee that they paid.
Critics also need to look at the bigger picture. While all-you-can-eat buffets are obviously not ideal for health, the impact on the environment is much worse. The damage wrecked by these tons of wasted food could be irrevocable, and no amount of buffet fees would be able to reverse it.
Christina Rivera, co-owner of Gobi Mongolian BBQ House, told the Times that the policy was implemented because she “hates to see food go to waste.” Still, it’s safe to say that there’s also an economic interest in it, which shouldn’t be dismissed as negative. Profit motives are actually reasonable considering the state of the economy today, which is riddled with record-high ingredient prices. With a reduction in food waste, there will be lower disposal costs and labor costs, helping both the environment and restaurant pricing for consumers.
The cost of wasted food also affects citizens — not just businesses. According the Times, the annual cost of wasted food around the world, excluding seafood, is $750 billion, which amounts to $40 billion per year for the United States.
This policy should be coupled with other food-saving strategies. For one, chefs should switch up menus daily depending on what they have available so items in refrigerators and pantries will be used up in time. Initiatives such as the newly established U.S. Food Waste Challenge, which launched this April, actively recruits businesses partners such as Chipotle and Momofuku to divert half their food waste from landfills. There’s also the option of recycling, as demonstrated by the businesses that recycle their wasted food. One prime example is Bob Combs, a Nevada pig farmer, who turns leftovers from Vegas casino buffets into slop for his pigs.
The effort it takes to stop the food waste problem takes everyone. Consumers and entrepreneurs alike must unite for this cause to reduce food loss, recover good food and recycle leftovers for other uses such as composting and energy generation. As a nation, we’ve bitten off more than we can chew, so it’s time to fill up our plates appropriately.
And if that means an extra fee as an incentive, so be it.

With their final two matches coming during Thanksgiving week, the USC women’s volleyball team couldn’t be blamed for looking ahead to the first four rounds of the NCAA tournament its set to host over the next two weeks. Nevertheless, the squad took care of business and notched two more victories that will give them even more momentum heading into the playoffs.
The No. 7 Women of Troy (26-5, 16-4 Pac-12) dismantled rival UCLA on the road Wednesday night 3-0 (25-22, 25-11, 25-13) and then honored their senior class with another 3-0 sweep, this time knocking off Colorado (26-24, 25-14, 25-21) for their fourth straight win to conclude the regular season.
In her final regular season match, libero and captain Natalie Hagglund shone with 18 digs in addition to five assists and a service ace. Fellow senior middle blocker Alexis Olgard added eight kills at a .389 clip and four blocks, while outside hitter Sara Shaw registered five kills and five digs.
“I’ll miss them a lot when they’re gone. You really start appreciating them when you go in the huddle and they’re not there,” head coach Mick Haley said. “I expect to be here the next two weeks for four more matches so I don’t see this as their last match. I think this team is good enough to win and we want to stay with it.”
Against the Bruins, sophomore outside hitter Samantha Bricio and freshman counterpart Ebony Nwanebu each recorded 12 kills to lead the USC attack to its first sweep of UCLA since 2004. Olgard added eight kills from the middle and Hagglund was strong once again with 16 digs.
“It’s always good to get a win at their place and we had an incredible crowd,” Hagglund said. “We spread out our offense a lot so they didn’t know who to stop.”
As expected, the first frame was tight as USC fell behind 18-16. But the Women of Troy rattled off six consecutive points to go up 22-18 and staved off a Bruin comeback to go up 24-21 on a Bricio kill. UCLA saved a point but the Women of Troy finished it on an Nwanebu kill.
The second set was a marked difference, as USC went up by an incredible 23-9 margin before an Olgard kill sealed the set at 25-11. The third set was much of the same with USC taking leads of 17-7 and then 22-10 on another Olgard strike. A Bricio kill brought up match point at 24-12, and after the Bruins managed one last point, freshman outside hitter Elise Ruddins concluded the victory with her fourth and final kill.
“I think we may have had more fans here than the Bruins,” Haley said. “That support allowed our team to take another stride forward. Bricio and Nwanebu were terrific and the setters did a great job as well. We didn’t have a bad performance from anybody.”
USC again had a tough first set against the Buffs, who were relentless in their attack. After falling behind 16-12, the Women of Troy fought back to within 20-19, after which a Colorado error and a subsequent Bricio kill restored the USC lead at 21-20. More back-and-forth action ensued before a block and a kill by junior middle blocker Hannah Schraer ended the set 26-24.
The second set opened up for USC, which gained a 16-8 lead on a Bricio kill. Freshman libero Anne Marie Schmidt entered the match and knocked down an ace for a 22-11 lead. An Schraer block gave USC set point at 24-13 and after CU saved a point, USC took the set 25-14 on an error.
Olgard and Ruddins combined on a block to give USC a 13-9 lead in the final frame, and Bricio knocked down another strong kill to push the advantage to 16-12. The Buffaloes fought back to cut the deficit to 22-20, but consecutive kills by Nwanebu and Ruddins brought up match point at 24-20. Colorado earned a point but then committed an error to seal the set 25-21.
The win allowed USC to improve to a perfect 8-0 against Colorado since the Buffaloes joined the Pac-12 two years ago.
The victories put USC in a good position entering the NCAA Tournament, but Haley noted that the team will need to improve if it hopes to achieve success.
“We struggled to have a rhythm and be explosive the whole day,” Haley said. “It was our fourth match in eight days and the seniors were emotional. I’m happy with the trio of wins, but we can play better than that.”
USC was announced as the overall No. 6 seed by the NCAA committee on Sunday, and will kick off the tournament on Friday against New Hampshire.

The USC football head-coaching search is over – and once again, the Trojans will be led by a disciple of former head coach Pete Carroll. Former Washington head coach Steve Sarkisian, who oversaw the development of two Heisman Trophy winning quarterbacks under Carroll alongside former USC head coach Lane Kiffin, has accepted the position and will replace interim head coach Ed Orgeron.
Despite widespread fan support for Orgeron that was slightly tempered after a season-ending 35-14 loss to UCLA, athletic director Pat Haden decided to hire Sarkisian, 39, after the former USC offensive coordinator compiled a 34-29 record (24-21 in the Pac-12) in five years at Washington.
Sarkisian interviewed with Haden over the weekend, and Haden confirmed that Sarkisian was offered the job Monday morning and promptly accepted.
“We are delighted to welcome Steve Sarkisian back to the Trojan Family,” said Haden, who will hold a press conference at 2 p.m. on Tuesday in the John McKay Center to formally introduce Sarkisian. “We conducted a very exhaustive and thorough search, pinpointing about 20 candidates and interviewing five of them. We kept coming back to Sark.”
It was reported earlier by multiple media outlets that Texas A&M head coach Kevin Sumlin and Denver Broncos defensive coordinator Jack Del Rio had been interviewed by USC earlier this fall, in addition to Orgeron and Sarkisian. Sources tell the Daily Trojan that former Tampa Bay Buccaneers coach Jon Gruden was the fifth candidate to be interviewed.
Sarkisian was an assistant coach for the Trojans for seven years, including two years as the offensive coordinator for Carroll. During his time at USC, Sarkisian tutored two Heisman Trophy quarterbacks in Matt Leinart and Carson Palmer, and the Trojans held a 22-3 record when he called the plays.
“I am extremely excited to be coming home to USC and for the opportunity that USC presents to win championships,” Sarkisian said. “I can’t wait to get started.”
Meanwhile, Orgeron, who guided the Trojans to a 6-2 record following the dismissal of Kiffin, said he is leaving USC to pursue head coaching opportunities.
“I am grateful to the University of Southern California for the great time I had here,” Orgeron said. “I am especially proud of this year’s team and coaching staff, who had to start a new season and then bonded, played together as a family and competed like Trojans.”
Haden reportedly offered Orgeron a pay raise and a position on the staff as assistant head coach, but the former defensive line coach and recruiting coordinator was reportedly “outraged” at being passed over for the head coaching gig, according to ESPN’s Brett McMurphy. Orgeron will leave Troy after overseeing a second-half run that featured a massive upset of then-No. 5 Stanford that reinvigorated USC’s fan base.
“[Orgeron] understandably was disappointed when I told him we were going in a different direction,” Haden said. “We talked about the possibility of him remaining at USC, but Ed wants to be a head coach and I am supportive of that.”
After staunchly supporting Orgeron throughout his tenure, USC’s players will have to rebound and play under new leadership. It has yet to be announced if Sarkisian or another current USC coach will lead the Trojans into their pending bowl game.
During his tenure in Seattle, Sarkisian was noted for his excellent recruiting skills across the West Coast, a skill that made him a very attractive option for USC. In 2008, the Huskies finished 0-12, and Sarkisian impressed the nation by leading Washington to a respectable 5-7 in his first year on the job. The Huskies’ eight victories this year were the most at UW since 2000.
Sarkisian’s contract with USC spans five years, according to Los Angeles Daily News’ Scott Wolf. He will be immediately tasked with reconstructing the Trojans’ offense, potentially with freshman quarterback Max Browne, whom he heavily recruited to play for the Huskies.
The Trojans have struggled to regain their status as an offensive juggernaut they held while under the tutelage of Carroll, Sarkisian and Kiffin in the mid-2000s. Washington was ranked No. 8 in the nation offensively this year, averaging over 500 yards a game, while USC was ranked No. 80 with 392.3 yards per game.
Vanderbilt head coach James Franklin and Boise State head coach Chris Peterson were also reportedly top candidates, with both having shown the prowess to guide programs to unprecedented success.
But in choosing Sarkisian, Haden decided to invest in the future of USC football by maintaining a link to the past.
Sarkisian was expected to have his first meeting with USC players at 7 p.m. Monday night, according to Bruce Feldman of CBS Sports.
Editor’s Note: This post has been updated to include more information as this story develops.  
I think it is time get get rid of the AD.. The President of the University should be looking for a new one.  This trojan feels like the AD sucker punched us all.
American culture has become increasingly impersonal, technological, competitive and profit driven. It is rare in an organization, corporation and even family for people to feel truly valued, believed in and as a result strive to be and do their best. Coach O. brought this gift to our Trojan football team when he served as interim Head Coach.
The turnaround from a mediocre season to a definite winning one was notable. The change in spirit by the players and fans, the pulling together as a family and the belief in themselves, each other and coach O was the true accomplishment. What a remarkable learning experience for all about the value we can bring to each other. What more could you ask from a college football coach?
Pat Haden could not possibly expect more from anyone. Consider this–who as a coach comes to mind that you believe could have stepped in when Coach O did to produce both the remarkable turnaround in performance on the field and desire by the players to do their best? Likely no one.
I am amazed and concerned that Pat Haden is insensitive and unmoved by the rare accomplishment of coach O. I will readily accept there may be some compelling reason for a change to Sarkisian I cannot identify since I am not an A.D.
I do hope Sarkisian can produce as many wins as Coach O. 
USC lost the opportunity to deepen and broaden beyond the team a culture of belief in oneself and each other. USC played as well as they did and beat rhen #5 Stanford without depth of reserves because of the human qualities Coach O lived and instilled in our players. I expect we lost our last season game to UCLA in large measure because players knew or were deeply concerned Coach O was leaving. With interviews ongoing and a small tight world within USC athletics and players with Washington and teams, no doubt concern was there. If beating Stanford and the level of play USC displayed did not bring a head coach offer to Coach O, it clearly was not coming. As for the “excuse” that Pat Haden did not want to distract the team with an announcement, confirming Coach O. would have ended the distraction to the joy of the players. No announcement confirming Coach O spoke volumes.
I do hope USC has successful seasons with win-loss records. What was lost with Coach O.’s departure as interim Head Coach can’t be tallied in the standings, but will be a lifelong memory for our players and hopefully a learning experience about the potential value we each hold for each other.
Coach O, what excitement and pride you brought back to the players, the fans and yes even the parents.  It was so exciting to see the stadium packed with screaming fans and cheering the Coach O cheer!  I asked my son what they were chanting and I almost cried knowing how proud the student body felt seeing the team perform so well under your coaching direction. God Bless you and so sorry to see you go.  I could tell the players were off against UCLA, perhaps they already knew you were not going to be their head coach.  What a shame!
I think I feel a little different the most of the people posting.  Coach O did do a great job in the second half, or did he, or was coach O just breath of fresh air from the horribel Lame Kiffen…..I think the team played better because they were as happy to git rid of him as we were!!!  But I do think coach O did deserve a chance at a full season.  I think Hayden should of gave him 1 year to show what he could do.  I did read last nigh where some of the commits that were on the wire are excited that Sark is coming in.  The one thing I do know is that Sark is great at bring in the best of the best.  I think as fans, we should support Sark and hope for the best.  If he fails……Fire him and his buddy Hayden.  Other than that, I am excited for change and FIGHT ON!!
Coach O is a big loss. He orchestrated a fantastic turnaround and is one of the best recruiters ever. Sark will be only a bit better than his “brother” Lane Kiffin. He has left the U many times before, in 3 years he will be gone again. A sad day.
Pat Haden…Backed coach Kiffen….hired Sarkesian…fired coach O… when Sarkesian flops….fire Pat Haden!
Coach O…FiGHT ON FOREVER…Pat Haden…should be fired…I could do a better job at his position in my sleep
Haden  hires in his own image.  Just like Haden, Sarkisian is a white former quarterback. Haden only feels comfortable when people who look, talk and act like him hold all the top leadership positions in USC athletics.
Currenly there are 2 full-time employees on the USC football coaching staff who are  non-white.  One was hired last season and the other was hired this season. If Haden had been doing his job, he would have integrated the  football coaching staff years ago.  Has USC ever had a black quarterback under Haden? Of course not.  Only people who look like Haden are qualified to be USC quarterbacks.  Even if Coach O had beat the Bruins, Haden would not have hired him.  Coach O has rough edges, talks like a Cajun and sometimes chews tobacco.  Haden would be embarrassed to take Coach O to his private club.  Haden needs to retire immediately and the next AD at USC needs to be black.
I don’t think race has anything to do with it, but I will say that Garrett was a stud and you’re right about Haden being an elitist jerk who would in fact be embarrassed to be seen with Coach O at a social function.  He is a spineless jerk.
There are some things in life that are ineffable. The belief we have in others and feel from others is one. It is nothing short of miraculous the sudden turnaround by USC under Coach O with the often expressed sentiment that he believed in us.
I think an unheralded opportunity was lost by not hiring O for at least next season. I fully expect the players either know before Saturday’s game or strongly expected Coach O was not going to be named head coach for next year and this accounted for the letdown to Kiffin reign play level noted during the UCLA game. 
The players voiced what they needed and how Coach O provided it and their needs fell on deaf ears. I think this will make it very difficult for the players and Sarkisian and egret it may well show on the field.
The magic was great while it lasted.
A basic insensitivty
I must say to Coach “O” you are a wonderful and caring man and we were very lucky to have you.  What you did for SC will live on well past your short tenure as head coach.   You showed what a man of faith and class can do with group of confused and bewildered young men.   I hope this new Armenian head coach is half the man that you are.
All our best Coach “O” and God Bless
Thanks, Pat for bringing back the Denny’s menu and the Bubble Screen with Sark. We’ve all missed them terribly the last eight games. Obviously, Orgeron never had a real chance.  “Character”, that’s what Haden preaches, “Character”.”
If Haden was a man of good character, he would have put an end to the racist hiring practices in the football program the first year he was hired.
Coach O you were there when we needed to bring life back to our USC team and fans, I am sure this is a decision Pat Haden will regret.  Steve Sarkisian bailed on us once what is to stop him from doing it again?
  I think its time for the University to look for a new A.D.  We need an AD who cares and rewards hard work.  Coach O you will be a success where ever you go… If it were up to the students, players and alumni you would be head coach.. not someone who took off on us once before.
If Sarkisian does not work out that will be Hayden’s 3rd bad decision ( Kiffin, Coach O)
Hayden should be fired in like manner !!!  Coach O thanks for giving your heart to us !
Coach O did an amazing job of restoring some measure of dignity to SC Football after Haden’s boy, Lame, took it to never before seen depths of incompetence.  The Trojan family owes Coach O an eternal debt of gratitude. Nonetheless, he (and we) had to learn the hard way: losing to the Irish and the Bruins in the same season is a no go.
Let’s hope Ed gets another opportunity to lead and that Sark is where he shoulda been when Pete left.
Sark = Kiffin 2.0? hope not
Anyways, thanks Coach O! You did a fantastic job.
Thank you Coach O.  You are the choice of the players, students, and the parents…
How many coaches have their own cheer!  “Coach O!”
Only time will tell if this is a good choice.  Coach O, thank you for a great second half.  You have made a fan in me.  Where ever you land, I will cheer.
The interim coach did a fine job. I enjoyed the late morning televised USC pre-game show on ESPN 2 or 3 weeks ago. They really stuck it to Stanford. I’m a Buckeye. Best wishes in the BCS polls.
We will definitely miss Coach O.  He brought life back into the team this year and hope he can stay.
Coach O, I hope you go somewhere else, and get the respect you deserve. Thank you for all the hard work you gave to my university. I sure hate to get a coach in Sarkisian who is walking out on his current players in Washington.
