A USC-affiliated program is conducting a study that will help underserved families gain access to the resources they need for their children to be successful.
The new program combines the national organization Parents as Teachers, which supports families with young children, with USC Telehealth, a virtual counseling and therapy clinic.
Parents as Teachers is interested  in the early development of children. Its model aims to give parents the resources to prepare their children, from birth through kindergarten, for educational success.
USC Telehealth was created in 2012. It delivers evidence-based psychosocial intervention through video technology. This is new to almost all home visitation models; all others have to do with physically going into the home.
Right now, there are various obstacles that prevent Parents as Teachers from reaching more families. Currently, home visitors need to travel to each home, which reduces the amount of time available for the home visitation. It can be difficult for the home visitors to plan each visit, due to the families’ busy schedules. Sometimes, families are uncomfortable with the home visitors entering their residences. Some families live in rural areas, making it difficult for the home visitors to reach them.
The partnership with USC Telehealth aims to eliminate these burdens, allowing Parents as Teachers to provide services to more families in a virtual format.
Angela Rau, virtual parent education coordinator at the Parents as Teachers National Center, said that the partnership with USC Telehealth is imperative for the organization to stay relevant in the digital age.
“Parents as Teachers is interested in looking at ways to engage families and looking at avenues to offer parent education to all families,” Rau said. “In this generation, we have more and more families using technology to get information. We are stepping into the use of the Telehealth platform with USC to be responsive to this generation of families.”
The results of the study will indicate the effectiveness of the partnership. USC School of Social Work graduate fellows have been trained to serve the families using the Parents as Teachers model. Sixty-five families will be included in the study, all recruited from the L.A. Best Babies Network.
iPads are available to those families who do not have access to the technology needed for the video conferences. However, Rau said she has been surprised to discover that the families already have the technology needed.
“A couple of the families that have come in were surprised by how easy it was to come into the video conferencing platform,” Rau said. “It’s making us think that this effort is building the digital literacy of parents.”
Dorian Traube, associate professor at the USC School of Social Work, came up with the idea to put the Parents as Teachers model on the Telehealth platform.
“My initial interest is reducing child maltreatment — reducing the number of families who are engaged by the child welfare system,” Traube said. “We are looking at that, school readiness, and making sure children are receiving intervention if they are experiencing developmental delays.”
By the time a child growing up in poverty reaches age 3 he or she has heard, on average, 3 million fewer words than a child who is not growing up in poverty.
Jamie Goodpaster, content manager at Parents as Teachers, looks forward to a long-lasting relationship with the University.
“We are excited about partnering with the University of Southern California, and we are hoping to have a long, positive relationship,” Goodpaster said. “We are looking forward to the research outcome of the program.”

The Saved By Grace Gospel Choir will be performing on Saturday from 12:50 to 1:20 p.m. on the Main Stage at this year’s Los Angeles Times Festival of Books.
Met by a generous crowd at their past four performances at the festival, SBG lifts everyone’s spirits through it’s joyous and inclusive songs. Its music, which speaks to a large demographic, promotes spiritual and personal development.
SBG was founded in September 1998 and originally went by the name of the “USC Gospel Choir.” Now in its 17th year, SBG has established itself as the choir that spreads the “good news of Jesus Christ through music and spiritual fellowship,” according to the club’s website.
The Daily Trojan had the opportunity to interview Ifeyinwa Anene, the president of SBG.
Daily Trojan: SBG has been very well received at the Festival of Books in previous years. Have you made any changes to this year’s act?
IA: The Festival of Books is an event that we are particularly fond of. Usually the timing of the Festival and our annual spring concert are in close conjunction, so we like to give our audience a little taste of the coming events of our spring concert. The songs that we sing are songs from a selection of our semester’s repertoire coming from a diverse body of both traditional and contemporary gospel music. The songs performed in previous years are songs that are featured in previous concerts from artists such as Tye Tribett, James Fortune and of course, Kirk Franklin. We don’t want to ruin the surprise for the this year’s spring concert, so if you want to come hear the songs that we have chosen from this year, come out and hear us sing on Saturday at this year’s Festival of Books.
DT: Your performances are always so put together. How long did SBG spend preparing for your upcoming performance?
IA: Our work on our repertoire is a semester long process; as a choir we meet once a week on Mondays from 7-9 p.m. and really perfect the songs that we plan to sing at the concert. What will be presented at the Festival of Books will be the product of several weeks of hard work and commitment.
DT: Why should festival-goers go see SBG perform?
IA: If you’re looking for a performance to make you boogie in public, this is the show for you. If you’re looking for an experience different from any other that you’ve experienced, this is it for you. If you’re looking to be uplifted, again, this is not a performance that you want to miss. Anyone who comes and hears what we are about is sure to leave not only with a glow in their chest but a greater sense of camaraderie and connectedness with the people around them.
DT: Any last words?
IA: If you like what you see at the Festival of Books, please come join us at our Spring Concert on April 17 at TCC Ballroom. Doors open at 7 p.m., and it’s free admission for all!

The Los Angeles Times Festival of Books will be hosting an “Ideas Exchange” speaker series as part of the annual weekend event held on the USC campus. The series welcomed personalities such as Candice Bergen and Octavia Spencer at last year’s festival. “Ideas Exchange” offers audiences an insight into the minds and lives of the speaker in a live conversation with a Los Angeles Times interviewer.
The first speaker of the series will be Carrie Brownstein, an actor, musician and writer best known as a member of the band Sleater-Kinney and for her show Portlandia, in which she is a writer and actor. Brownstein, who will be interviewed by the Los Angeles Times’ Lorraine Ali, has written about her opinions on music and culture that have appeared in publications, such as The New York Times and other online outlets. Brownstein has seen many successes in recent years, with the release of Sleater-Kinney’s album No Cities to Love, which received widespread critical acclaim and was ranked fourth on the Billboard U.S. Top Rock Albums Chart. Portlandia, a reference to Portland, Oregon, where she lives, has earned both an Emmy nomination and a Peabody Award. Brownstein will be interviewed in Bovard Auditorium Sunday at 11 a.m., and the ticket fees include a signed copy of her memoir, Hunger Makes Me A Modern Girl: A Memoir.
The second speaker is journalist Arianna Huffington, who is the founder and editor-in-chief of The Huffington Post. Huffington has several decades of journalism experience and has led The Huffington Post since 2005, guiding it to become one of the most successful news sites in the digital era. She has also authored 15 books, some of which have been New York Times Bestsellers. Huffington’s accolades include being one of Forbes’ most influential women in media and one of TIME’s Most Influential People. The Greek-born journalist has been giving lectures in connection to her new book, The Sleep Revolution: Transforming Your Life One Night At A Time. Huffington advocates for healthier habits towards sleep and preventing sleep deprivation, which in turn affects the public’s professional and personal lives and well-being. Huffington’s arrival at USC will be followed again by a Visions and Voices event on April 13, at the Trojan Grand Ballroom at the Ronald Tutor Campus Center, where she will make her presentation to college students — the demographic often considered the most affected by poor sleeping habits. Huffington will speak with Los Angeles Times columnist Robin Abcarian at the Bovard Auditorium Sunday at 3 p.m. The ticket fee will also include a signed copy of The Sleep Revolution.
Tickets for the speaker series are available through the Los Angeles Times Festival of Books website page via Eventbrite. Tickets range from $30 to $100.

My boyfriend launches up from his kingdom of blankets as soon as I ask him for help on this week’s column. Music with no words is his jurisdiction, and Spotify is up and blasting before I’ve even explained why that’s the topic.
The Los Angeles Times Festival of Books this weekend is the perfect platform to talk about books and music. It can be a cacophony of sounds or a beautiful symphony; it’s about finding the right harmony. A lot of people think it’s weird that I can read and listen to music at the same time. It goes beyond that though. I actually struggle to focus on books if music isn’t playing in the background. Call me a child of television and film, but it’s the swelling of notes in my ears that allows me to get lost in the words.
Don’t misunderstand — I don’t have Taylor Swift at top volume while trying to read Elie Wiesel’s Night, and Johnny Cash never soundtracked my Sarah Dessen binges. Music and books are like wine and food; obviously you can do it with whatever pairing but the best results will come when the two match. My first memory of noticing how the two could bleed together was in the 7th grade when I read 1984 and A Brave New World listening to Andrew Bird’s The Mysterious Production of Eggs and being blown away at the parallels. From there, it was Damien Rice’s “The Blower’s Daughter” becoming the anthem to my experience reading The Hunger Games.
The best way to begin is with music with no words. And that brings us back to my boyfriend’s excitement. My first foray into contemporary lyricless music was with Vitamin String Quartet. I found them through a simple Google search for good music to play while studying. At my fingertips were all the songs I knew already, in a wordless art. It was simple enough; I already knew the emotions of the song. One look at the back of the book for a synopsis and I knew which song from the quartet to choose. I became a literary John Williams. A few pages of the book and my instinct told me which of VSQ’s renditions to play. But then I became curious … there had to be more out there that my newly acquired soundtracking skills could utilize.
With music’s heavy exploration of electronic techniques, I began searching the depths of ambient, indie and electronic to find soft lullabies and pounding beats to back my books. From those you trip to at music festivals to the ones you only find 400 clicks away from your starting point on YouTube, it’s all about finding what you read best to.
And while I have your attention, I thought I’d add on some book recommendations as well. See you all at the festival this weekend.

John Doe, singer and writer, will be performing songs from his new record The Westerner, at the Los Angeles Times Festival of Books this Sunday at the LA Soundstage. Dedicated to his friend and fellow artistic soul, Michael Blake, Doe aims to do justice to all that Blake has taught him about writing and art. The Daily Trojan got to chat with Doe about his new record and his appearance at the Festival of Books.
Daily Trojan: Your new record, The Westerner, will be released at the end of the month. The cover is very symbolic, with a boy staring at horses out on a prairie. What sorts of musical vibes can we expect from this album?
John Doe: It was recorded in Tucson with Howe Gelb and has the space and psychedelic elements you can only find in the desert. The cover was created by Shepard Fairey and Aaron Huey for the Protect the Sacred campaign and Honor the Treaties.
DT:  In your video for “Get on Board” from the album, you appear to be on a subway platform in New York City, but the song’s lyrics suggest that the train could be traveling cross-country. Does being a Westerner hold any particular meanings to you, as someone who has performed internationally. What inspired you to write and curate a book on the L.A. punk scene?
JD: The video was filmed in Brooklyn and the train is a train of life or a train of death. It doesn’t have to be a train traveling across country. I’ve lived in California for over 40 years and there is a unique space and light in the west. If it wasn’t for the L.A. punk scene, I wouldn’t have a career in music or film. It’s been a dream of lifetime. The reason there are many contributors is because the L.A. punk scene was based on collaboration.
 
DT: Has writing always been a passion of yours? What made the L.A. punk scene special compared to other cities during that time, such as San Francisco or New York?
JD: Writing has always been a passion. I’ve written 200-plus songs and many poems. This is the first biographical piece I’ve ever written. I realize this book gives the reader a chance to experience L.A. from that era from first hand accounts. L.A. had cars — that’s the biggest difference. And cars are one of the building blocks of rock ‘n’ roll.
 
DT: L.A. is still considered a main city for ambitious artists to come and make a name for themselves. Do you still think it gives that same opportunity to bands and performers that has been portrayed through the decades?
JD:  Everything in art, music, acting is different now than it was back then. L.A. is still a media center but nothing like it was then. Artists like Phoebe Bridgers, The Americans and Silversun Pickups ate carrying on the tradition of DIY artists.
 
DT: The Los Angeles Times Festival of Books is a hub for all sorts of creative minds of different fields and backgrounds to convene. Although it is very different than performing at a traditional concert hall, what are you looking forward to about performing in front of this audience?
JD: Free shows are always fun! The John Doe Rock ‘n’ Roll band is a band of all stars featuring Cindy Wasserman, DJ Bonebrake (of X), Val McCallum (Jack Sh-t), Ryan Feves (Eleni Mandell), and we will be playing new material, favorites and X songs.

The highly anticipated Los Angeles Times Festival of Books will bring a number of esteemed writers and performers to the USC campus, such as Arianna Huffington, Taye Diggs and Janet Fitch. However, the Festival of Books will also feature many writers of color in the beginning of their careers.
Opera fans will swoon for Korean-American author Alexander Chee’s first novel The Queen of the Night, which was published in early February by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt. The book, which chronicles the harrowing life and memories of fictional operatic soprano Lilliet Berne, has garnered rave reviews, being called “A multi-stranded, thoroughly researched epic” by The Atlantic and an “extravagant five-act grand opera of a novel…” by the Wall Street Journal. Chee will participate in the conversation “Fiction: History on the Page” on Saturday in the Norris Theater at 11:30 a.m.
USC Professor of English and American Studies and Ethnicity, Viet Thanh Nguyen, wrote the novel The Sympathizer, published by Grove Press. The book has received much attention since its release in April 2015, with The New Yorker referring to the novel’s best moments as “painful, hilarious exposures of white tone-deafness.” In addition to becoming a national bestseller, Nguyen’s debut novel has won the 2016 Andrew Carnegie Medal for Excellence in Fiction, the 2015 Center for Fiction First Novel Prize and was a finalist for the 2016 PEN/Faulkner Award. Nguyen will appear in the discussions “Fiction: The Underbelly” on Saturday in Hoffman Hall at 12 p.m. as well as “Past and Present: The Echoes of War,” moderated by Los Angeles Times editor Jim Newton, Saturday at the Hancock Foundation at 4:30 p.m.
Poet Robin Coste Lewis, a Provost’s Fellow in Poetry and Visual Studies at USC, is another featured speaker at this year’s festival. Her debut book of poetry Voyage of the Sable Venus, which won the 2015 National Book Award for Poetry, was published by Alfred A. Knopf in September 2015. The book was hailed by Claudia Rankine as a work that “reframes the black figure, most specifically the black female, by pointing out the borders of black beauty, black happiness, and black resilience in our canonical visual culture.” Lewis has also had her poetry published in The Massachusetts Review, The Harvard Gay & Lesbian Review, Transition and VIDA. She will appear in the talk “Race, Justice, and Poetry” moderated by USC Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism professor Taj Frazier on Sunday in Wallis Annenberg Hall at 1:30 p.m.
Iranian writer Parnaz Foroutan made her literary debut with The Girl from the Garden in August 2015. The novel has been hailed as a “lush debut” by Willamette Week, as well as “a powerful and moving novel about the devastating choices women face when their worth is tied to their wombs but not themselves” by journalist and political activist Gloria Steinem. Foroutan will appear in the talk “Fiction: The Ties That Bind” with Elizabeth Marro and Karen Olsson on Sunday in Hoffman Hall at 3:30 p.m.
In addition to the writers mentioned above, many other budding authors and poets will appear in person at the Festival of Books. A full schedule of talks and discussions can be found online.

Courtney Tarleton epitomizes the term “defensive anchor.”
A lockdown defender on the women’s lacrosse team, Tarleton has helped the No. 7 Women of Troy leap out to an 11-0 record this season. The senior from Ridgewood, New Jersey, has been a constant at the back of the field for the program during her four years — never missing a start in 67 career games.
The team is allowing a meager 4.55 goals per game — the best goals against average in the NCAA by a wide margin — the Women of Troy are absolutely humming.
“It definitely feels different,” Tarleton said, comparing this season to her first three. “I feel like we’re finally meshing for the first time.”
The communication among the defenders is evident — so too is the humble swagger that emanates from the team on game days.
“I think there’s just definitely a higher level of confidence this year,” Tarleton said. “We have defenders from every single grade stepping up right now.”
Unsurprisingly, this is a tight-knit group both inside and outside of the huddle.
“We’re all so close off the field,” Tarleton said. “When you’re getting on the field, you’re looking to your left and your right and you’re seeing your best friends.”
Communication is not a mere luxury for defenders — it’s a necessity.
“You can kind of tell what people next to you are going to do before they even do it,” Tarleton said, satisfied with the fluidity of the defensive unit so far.
Tarleton has held down the fort alongside her fellow defenders and netminder sophomore Gussie Johns. The defender lauds the play of the midfielders and attackers, who consistently find the back of the net at the offensive end.
“I just have so much trust in them,” Tarleton said of her attacking counterparts. “I feel like I can take a deep breath every time they have the ball because I know something incredible is going to happen on the attacking end.”
Tarleton can spark an attack when the ball is in her possession, as she keeps her head on a swivel and effortlessly finds outlet passes. The veteran has scooped up 21 ground balls this season and has caused 25 turnovers.
Tarleton explained that her defensive prowess has improved tremendously since she arrived on campus for her freshman year.
“My team defense has gotten better. Over the years I’ve just gotten a better trust of my teammates,” Tarleton said, also acknowledging that her composure has improved over the years — especially since being named captain as a sophomore.
“I liked the idea that I could make an impact on a team at a young age,” Tarleton said, elaborating on her decision to hit the West Coast as opposed to staying in the lacrosse hub that is the Northeast.
Additionally, having a number of teammates from New York and her native New Jersey expedited the transition phase and helped her become acclimated to life at USC.
“That definitely made it easier knowing that there would be people from the east coast,” Tarleton said.
Players like Tarleton have helped USC become a legitimate national title contender in the program’s fourth year of existence. The defensive machine that wears No. 1 for the Women of Troy employs a “by-any-means” style. She refuses to get outrun. She will never be spotted being outhustled. She clearly does her homework on her opponents, as she always manages to put opposing attackers on the back foot.
“I feel like on defense sometimes you feel like you don’t have control,” Tarleton said. “I think if you step up and you’re aggressive, you kind of make the attacker think twice about the decisions that they make, and I think it gets them a little uneasy if you’re aggressive.”
It is an admirable and remarkably effective approach toward defending. It is a mindset. It is a plan of execution. It is a playing style. Tarleton has mastered it.
“It’s definitely hard to be confident throughout a whole entire lacrosse game, so if you do maybe hit down someone’s pass or if someone makes a bad decision — takes a bad shot — I feel like the defender definitely has the upperhand and can try and get in people’s heads,” Tarleton said.
It is a playing style that Tarleton has mastered.
“I like that I can kind of morph my personality into being easygoing but then still hardworking on the field,” Tarleton said. “There’s a fine line between being overly aggressive and then being out of control. I definitely have to be relaxed. I feel like any time I’m tense then things probably aren’t going well.”
Her balance of poise and calculated aggression has troubled opponents all season long. It is a playing style she has been refining for quite some time. She picked up the sport in second grade and continued to develop her game over the years, including during her time at Ridgewood High School.
Despite her East Coast roots, Tarleton wants to stay in California following graduation. She is completing her cinematic arts critical studies degree at USC and would like to work on the business side of television in the future.
Television has not only been a part of her coursework. It has slowly taken over her apartment. The television set in her apartment has been the victim of a ruthless reality TV invasion.
“I can’t even explain how many times I’ve seen [Keeping up with the Kardashians] from start to finish,” Tarleton said.
But she confirmed that conversations in her apartment have a funny way of finding their way back to lacrosse. For an athlete of Tarleton’s caliber, the sport is not merely what she does. It is an integral part of who she is.
Tarleton considers Tina Fey a role model off the field, but when she laces up the cleats, one of her biggest mentors is out there with her — directing the flow of practice and occasionally joining in on the action.
Head coach Lindsey Munday, who has seen a brand new program begin to flourish right before her eyes, never misses out on the chance to temporarily erase the line between coach and player.
“She’ll step into practice sometimes and play with us,” Tarleton said of Munday. “It’s just been nice to be around her because she’s always looked at us as equals. She’s just been a really great leader for us.”
Tarleton said all three coaches jump into practice from time to time, temporarily easing the divide between coach and player. The defender said this makes players more relaxed and can actually make Munday seem like a teammate.
“I think our coaches do a great job of always giving some of the glory to the defenders too,” Tarleton said. “They’re just very appreciative of the hard work that we put in.”
Tarleton puts in the work, but she combines it with mental preparation. She gets primed for game time with Bruce Springsteen, listening to “The Boss” for his calming influence. This genre gets her in the zone. Since the first game of her freshman year, Tarleton has said the same words in her head while the national anthem blares on the loudspeakers just prior to the start of a game. She wears her hair the same way for every game, has a lucky hair tie on her stick and partakes in the team ritual of pregame handshakes.
It is all part of the process.
With quick feet, active hands and supreme field vision, Tarleton is the type of player who could seemingly play any position. She clarified that this was not always the case.
“Honestly, when I was younger, I just wasn’t that good of a midfielder,” Tarleton said, chuckling at her former self. “So I definitely got pushed back to the defense.”
The whole defense thing seems to be working out just fine.

The top-two women’s water polo teams in the country will face off on Saturday when No. 1 USC hosts No. 2 UCLA in the second meeting this season of the crosstown rivals.
This will be the third time the Women of Troy have faced the Bruins, first beating UCLA in February during the Triton Invitational Championship game. USC won the title with an 8-6 victory.
USC and UCLA faced off in another title match during the championship game of the UCI Invitational in late February. The Trojans came out with a 10-7 win.
“Even though we’ve already defeated UCLA earlier in the season, we need to focus on our game and play hard on offense and stop them on defense,” sophomore goalie Victoria Chamorro said.
USC has been handling teams on the defensive side of the game, allowing a MPSF-leading 4.53 goals per game. Chamorro returns as an All-American from last year and is averaging 7.2 saves in her 30 periods of play.
The other standout goalie for the Women of Troy is freshman Amanda Longan who is averaging 8.7 saves during her 32 periods in the net.
USC’s own offensive prowess has allowed them to put up double-digit goals in 11 of their games so far this season. The Women of Troy (17-0, 3-0 MPSF) are second in the conference in goals scored with 12.59 goals per game and have outscored their opponents 214-77 over the course of the season.
The leading goal-scorer for USC is junior driver Stephania Haralabidis with 46 goals — a number good enough to put her at No. 9 on the all-time goals scored list with 160 in her career. Just behind her is her sister, junior driver Ioanna Haralabidis who has scored 31 goals during the season.
“Next week we want to focus on recognizing our opportunities on offense and forcing more turnovers on defense,” Stephania Haralibidis said. “We need to keep our intensity high.”
The emphasis for USC will be on stopping UCLA’s high-powered offense. The Bruins (20-2, 3-0 MPSF) won their three games last weekend by a combined score of 61-11. Other than their two losses to USC, the Bruins have yet to lose a game this season. UCLA top-two goal scorers have each found the back of the net 32 times this season.
“We need to be patient. It’s important that we take our time and watch the goalie so we can convert as many opportunities as possible,” sophomore utility Hayley McKelvey said. “We also really need to play hard on defense.”
The two wins this season for USC snapped a losing streak of five games to UCLA including last year’s 7-9 loss in the MPSF tournament semifinals. UCLA owns the all-time record though with a 49-24 advantage over the Trojans. The rivalry game will begin at 1 p.m. on Saturday at the Uytengsu Aquatic Center.
The Women of Troy won’t stop there though. Following their game against UCLA, USC has a non-conference game with Redlands slated to begin at 2:30 p.m. The Bulldogs (5-20) recently suffered a 5-20 loss against UCLA. USC holds an 8-1 record all-time against Redlands with the most recent game being a 31-0 win last year.

It is Opening Week for Major League Baseball, and with it comes all the pageantry of America’s pastime: the loud crack of the bat, the sliding catches, the peanuts and cracker jacks and the “unwritten rules” that lead to the dumbest controversies in all of sports.
If you haven’t heard of these “unwritten rules,” it’s because they aren’t actually rules; rather, they are old customs that players are just expected to follow, and they are really, really dumb traditions that do more harm than good.
There are literally hundreds of these, but here is an attempt to write out 10 so-called unwritten rules:
1. Never, ever, ever flip your bat after hitting a home run. Even if you’re thinking, “Damn, I hit that ball a long way,” and just want to stand there and admire it for a second, resist the urge. You should act like you’re ashamed to have humiliated the pitcher. Put your head down and jog around the bases (but not too slow because that also shows up the pitcher) like a true gentleman.
2. Otherwise, you risk retaliation in the form of a 95 miles-an-hour fastball coming straight at you the next time you take an at-bat because somewhere along the line in the history of baseball, someone decided an action that would be defined as “assault with a deadly weapon” anywhere else not on a baseball field was the best way to resolve issues — a great example for young kids out there.
3. Oh, but if you’re a pitcher and want to participate in this “retaliation,” don’t throw at the batter’s head. Instead, aim for areas such as his leg or back because you only risk breaking a bone rather than killing him. Trust me, that’s enough to justify it.
4. Sometimes, there isn’t a single player at fault, like when a team decides to celebrate a division-clinching win by jumping into the pool at their opponent’s stadium. In situations such as these (which are clearly unacceptable because celebrating is sanctioned in baseball) you should throw at the other team’s best player. After all, it’s his fault for being really good at baseball.
5. But the “unwritten rules” aren’t limited to situations where throwing at batters is acceptable. When a pitcher who has a perfect game going, under no circumstances should you talk about it — whether you’re a teammate, broadcaster or fan. Act like it’s not happening — otherwise, you’ll jinx it.
6. Speaking of perfect games, batters should never try to bunt to get on base and break it up. The first hit of the game should always be clean, not some “gimmick” that actually takes skill.
7. Bunting is also not OK when you have a large lead. Neither is stealing bases. Don’t you dare pad your stats and show up the other team. That’s not polite, and you know what’s coming the next time you come up to hit.
8. Here’s a really good one: Don’t walk across a pitcher’s mound at any time. Alex Rodriguez tried that in 2010 in a game against the Oakland A’s and pitcher Dallas Braden spoke afterward as if his privacy was violated.
“I don’t care if I’m Cy Young or the 25th man on the roster, if I’ve got the ball in my hand and I’m on that mound, that’s my mound,” Braden said. “He ran across the pitcher’s mound foot on my rubber. No, not happening. We’re not the doormat anymore.”
Isn’t baseball the best?
9. If your name is Bryce Harper or any other young phenom, beware. Opposing teams throw at your back just because they want to introduce you to the “old-school, prestigious way of baseball,” in the words of Cole Hamels, who was suspended five games in 2012 for hitting Harper in the back for no good reason, by his own admission. Also, your own teammates try to choke you in the dugout if you don’t run out a popup.
10. Basically, play the game the “right way.” Don’t be a rookie. Don’t celebrate too hard. Don’t win by too much. Give pitchers their “safe space.” Oh, and if you get traded to the Yankees and you have a beard, shave it off — all of it, or you’re not putting on that uniform. Baseball tradition must be respected.
If you’re wondering why baseball is failing to attract younger fans, it’s because of these “unwritten rules.” Baseball is inherently a slow sport. Games are played every day for approximately three hours, of which less than 20 minutes of actual action actually takes place. When put in comparison with fast-paced sports such as basketball, football or hockey, that’s an immediate turn-off.
Adding subjective “rules” that condemn celebrating and are full of random dos and don’ts makes it even worse.
“Baseball’s tired,” Harper said to ESPN The Magazine last month. “It’s a tired sport, because you can’t express yourself.”
He’s right. Showboating should be frowned upon, but staring at the ball after hitting a home run should not result in a fastball heading straight at your back.
Unfortunately, for every Bryce Harper, there’s a Goose Gossage, an old ex-ballplayer who went on a rant for the ages in response to Harper’s comments.
“What, do we want a bunch of Cam Newtons running around?” Gossage said to the New York Post.
Yes, Goose, as a matter of fact, a bunch of Cam Newtons running around is precisely what baseball needs.
Eric He is a freshman majoring in print and digital journalism. He is also the sports editor of the Daily Trojan. His column,  “Grinding Gears,” runs Fridays.
One must wonder if the writer ever played baseball. Perhaps he grew up overseas, playing another sport. Whatever his sport was, if it is as ancient as baseball, it likely has developed its own peculiar customs and traditions. Baseball is indeed a slow-moving, deliberate game without the constant, riveting action of basketball, soccer, hockey and other sports. Foreigners especially complain that baseball to them is plodding, boring and tedious, and they say they cannot understand the appeal.
But tens of millions of fans in the US, Japan and Central America grew up playing and watching the game, and like baseball fine the way it is. The knowledgeable ones find baseball’s quirks and idiosyncrasies intriguing and charming. OK, I like baseball, but I have been playing or watching for many years. Perhaps the writer of this “old school rules”  article will just have to find basketball, soccer and hockey games to watch.
Daily Bruin is better
One must wonder if the commenter is a xenophobe. Perhaps he grew up unexposed to other races. Whatever his background, if it taught some values, it likely has taught him that people of other races can be native-born Americans too. The writer is indeed an Asian American male without the traits of other traditional sports writers. Traditionalists especially complain about people who don’t fit the traditional model of an American and make assumptions.
But tens of millions of Americans have roots from other places like Japan and Central America. The knowledgeable ones accept the fact that Americans, regardless of their ethnicities, know about American culture as a whole. OK, I like comment sections, but I have been commenting for many years. Perhaps the writer of this comment will just have to keep making assumptions.
Fair enough, LaQuefa and Eric. No slur against race or ethnicity intended. Sorry. Not xenophobic; my four grandparents came to the US escaping terrible circumstances overseas, like the ancestors of many other Americans. My point was that the peculiar customs and rules of baseball may make little sense to someone who has not played the game, but are rooted in long tradition for those who have played and watched for many years.  These customs and rules are part of the game and traditionalists may prickle at criticism of baseball. But baseball is not an exclusively American game. Japan, Cuba, El Salvador, various other So. and Central American countries, Taiwan and several European countries play. Some of their baseball customs and tradition started in the US, some are their own, home-grown and may well be annoying to those unaccustomed to them.
On the other hand, Eric may have also enthusiastically played and watched other sports as well as baseball, whether they originated in the US sports or not. In most such cases, one can find customs and traditions that make little sense and may even seem counter to the fun of the sport. But they become rooted in long practice and history. Yes, Eric and LaQuefa have every right to point to such customs and traditions as being negative or illogical. And those who view baseball as sacrosanct may feel stung and respond with a sense of personal affront, believing the game to be part of their lives and not subject to criticism from others.  Keep up the good writing, LaQuefa and Eric.

The baseball team hopes to carry the momentum from Tuesday night’s 6-5 walk-off victory against Pepperdine into a critical three-game series against Utah.
Despite having a 10-15 overall record, the Utes are 7-2 in Pac-12, playing good enough to sit atop the conference standings along with Cal.
The Trojans improved to a 13-14 overall record in the tenth inning Tuesday after a walk-off single from senior centerfielder Timmy Robinson scoring redshirt sophomore Frankie Rios. The midweek game was a change of pace after the Trojans dropped two of three to Stanford the weekend prior.
Robinson, who was named a Pac-12 Player of the Week last week, credits both his and his teammates’ improved offensive production to the team playing more like a collective unit, and the batters’ primary focus is simply on making contact and getting on base. Robinson thinks this USC team has the talent to go on the winning run that head coach Dan Hubbs has been looking for, but expressed that the team will have to play far more consistently to do so.
“We are not here to compete with each others’ numbers; it is more what can we do to help the team win,” Robinson said. “If mine is RBIs, then that is my job, and everybody has their job. If we just stick to being a team and not worrying about individual stuff, I think that we will be fine.”
Hubbs believes that his team demonstrated its ability to overcome adversity in its extra inning win Tuesday, adding that the players may be feeling more comfortable in these high pressure situations because of the disproportionate number of games the Trojans have played that have been decided by 1 run this season already. Hubbs is hoping that adding a fully healthy senior pitcher Kyle Davis, sophomore pitcher Mitch Hart and freshman pitcher Marrick Crouse to the starting rotation later in the year will be the spark of talent and pitching they need to make it to the college playoffs.
“We want to be like that Virginia team was last year that got hot at the right time, got in and then wins the whole thing,” Hubbs said. “I think that talent wise we are capable of it. I think that on the mound we are starting to get healthy.”
The Trojans are preparing for a Utah team that Hubbs says maintains a lot of action on field by anticipating a large number of trick plays including the hit and run, the run and hit and the bump and run, which the Utes actively utilizes to stir the defense and create more offensive opportunities.
Utah travels to Los Angeles having lost its previous game Tuesday at Utah Valley University 4-10 but after sweeping Arizona in a three game home weekend series last weekend.
“I think that it will be a big weekend for us,” Hubbs said. “If we come out with a series win, I think that it will get us back on track as we go into Oregon.”
The first pitch of USC’s series with Utah is at 6 p.m. Friday at Dedeaux Field. The following two games will begin at 2 p.m. and 1 p.m. on Saturday and Sunday, respectively.

The No. 24 women’s tennis team is back at Marks Stadium after two road matches to face No. 66 Arizona and No. 26 Arizona State in two back-to-back conference matches Friday and Saturday, respectively.
The Women of Troy are 10-4 overall and 5-0 in the Pac-12 and currently on a winning streak of seven consecutive matches, with the last loss dating back to Feb. 25 against UCLA.
The team can rely on five players ranked nationally in singles. At No. 22 is senior captain Giuliana Olmos. She is currently on a seven-match win streak playing in the No. 1 singles spot, with just three losses overall in the season.
Sophomore Gabby Smith is currently ranked No. 103, followed by freshman Jessica Failla at No. 113. Failla is currently on a six-match win streak and has a team-best 18 singles wins so far in the season. At No. 117 is sophomore Madison Westby followed by freshman Rianna Valdes at No. 120 rounding out the nationally-ranked singles players.
Two doubles teams also made their appearance in the latest rankings update. At No. 8 in the country is the duo of Olmos and Smith who are the best ranked pair at USC. They are followed by junior Zoe Katz and Westby at No. 56.
The first opponent for the Women of Troy is No. 66 Arizona. The Wildcats are 12-9 overall in the season and 1-6 in conference matches after they split their road trip last weekend, defeating Washington State 5-2 and losing to Washington 3-4. In singles their only ranked player is junior Lauren Marker, currently at No. 42. Marker is also in the doubles rankings at No. 35, pairing up with senior Shayne Austin. USC has a 50-15 all-time record against Arizona. In the two teams meeting last season, the Trojans won 5-2 in Tucson.
On Saturday the team will play No. 26 Arizona State. The Sun Devils are 15-4 overall and 6-1 in conference matches, and are coming off a winning weekend against the Washington schools, beating the Huskies 4-1 and Washington State 6-1.
In singles ASU has two players nationally ranked. At No. 23 is senior Desirae Krawczyk, followed by junior Kassidy Jump at No. 84. In doubles, the pair of junior Alexandra Osborne and senior Ebony Panoho are ranked at No. 26, followed at No. 65 by Jump and and freshman Sammi Hampton.

It pains me to say that my latest donut adventure marks the penultimate post of my column, but I can at least say that it was a tasty end to my journey! Just like my experience with writing this biweekly column, my journey to U Jelly was long, but rewarding. With the store located in Fountain Valley, you will probably have to find a way to drive down there instead of Ubering or using public transportation. It sounds like a hassle, but after seeing pictures you’ll know it’s worth it.
Walking in on the right, you’ll see a white wall with a painting of a donut and a phrase you and I know all too well: “Donut Worry, Be Happy,” a.k.a. the name of this column! I know it’s cheesy, but I saw it as a sign (literally) to go there for my final destination. It’s a really small shop, but that lended itself to one of the things I appreciated the most, which was the personalized customer service. Upon walking in, the worker at the cashier immediately greeted me and went down the line describing all of the flavors. She also noticed that I had my camera with me and was planning on taking photos, so she made an effort to pick out the donuts that were decorated the best, which I really appreciated as a foodie!
What I liked the most about these donuts was the unique array of toppings. I was so fascinated by the options, that I actually ended up ordering six donuts because I felt so compelled to try as many as I could. My first decision was an easy one, and that was the mini flan donut. Asides from being absolutely adorable, I fell in love with how well the soft, vanilla taste of the flan blended with the coconut shavings. It didn’t really have any frosting so the dough felt a bit dry, but otherwise, I would say this was my favorite donut.

Because I love all things mini, the next donut I chose to try was the mini cinnamon roll. In my opinion, the only thing that made this donut extra special was the frosting. It tasted a bit more like flavored cream cheese, which I think gave it a richer overall consistency.
Paulina Ordaz | Daily Trojan
I tried the purple taro-flavored donut next because it was one of the most highly-recommended on Yelp, and I was not surprised why it received such good reviews. Compared to the other donuts, this one had a layer of frosting that was a lot softer and almost melted into the equally soft dough.
Paulina Ordaz | Daily Trojan
The oreo donut was my next choice, and I would really like to take a moment to appreciate the detail in each layer of the toppings — from the frosting to the chocolate drizzle to pieces of Oreo Hershey’s. The dough was also really spongy, which I found to be a really interesting twist after trying the other donuts.
Paulina Ordaz | Daily Trojan
My fifth donut (yes, I just said “fifth”) was the matcha-flavored one with a print of Baymax from the movie Big Hero 6. This was a much more simple option, but the matcha flavor still gave it a special taste worth trying.
Last but not least, I ordered the strawberry cream donut hoping that the two small slices of fruit would make up for the six donuts I ordered. I realize it doesn’t work that way, but the taste was good enough to make me forget my guilt. My only wish is that it had more cream, but I enjoyed it nonetheless.
Paulina Ordaz | Daily Trojan
Whether you decided to order six donuts like I did or just one, I guarantee you will not regret the experience. And if you do decide to indulge on all of the options, I have one piece of advice: Donut Worry, Be Happy!

USC Athletics is nothing short of a dynasty. With a combined 123 team national championships, the Trojans are at the top of the leaderboard among other Division I schools.
USC men’s sports certainly put the school’s athletic department on the map, but it’s the women’s sports that are keeping it there. To further support the Women of Troy’s prestige, measures should be taken to introduce more female athletic directors to the University. To remedy the current climate of gender imbalance in the sports administration, USC Athletics should look to a female athletic director as a replacement for outgoing Athletic Director Pat Haden.
Of the 10 senior members of the athletic department’s administration, only three are female. In the four top positions — athletic director and the three senior associate athletic directors — only one is a woman. Donna Heinel serves as a senior associate athletic director and is also listed as the “senior woman administrator,” a position designated by the NCAA, on the USC Athletics website. Conversely, there is no male counterpart position to this listed among the senior associate athletic directors.
Since Title IX requires that half of USC’s student-athletes are female, the athletic department should staff an administration representative of that population. If the next athletic director is not a female, he should at least add more women to his staff.
The administration is not the only part of USC Athletics that is lacking in gender equity. Of the 18 head coaches at the University, only five are women.
While the men’s teams have won 97 of the school’s titles, the women’s teams have won 26 championships since 1976. Considering that women did not have the same amount of athletic scholarships as men until 1972 when Title IX, an education act banning the exclusion of people from educational activities on the basis of sex, was signed into law, that number looks all the more impressive, and it is continuing to grow.
Had it not been for the women’s beach volleyball team, USC would have ended a 15-year streak of winning at least one title every year. The team capped an undefeated 2015 season with a win in the AVCA Championships. It looks like it will again be up to the women’s team to extend the streak, as the men’s teams have failed to win a title this year, and don’t appear to be in contention. The baseball team is hovering around .500 while the men’s tennis, golf and track and field teams are all ranked in the top 10, but have a lot of improvements to be made if they’re going to be taking home a championship. Trojan faithful have little reason to worry, however, as USC’s 15-year streak is in good hands. Women’s lacrosse and water polo both currently boast undefeated records while the sand volleyball team has only dropped two matches all season. While USC’s place in Division I history is rooted in men’s sports, the continuation of that legacy currently relies on the women’s teams.
It is for that reason that USC should strongly consider hiring a female athletic director — someone committed to furthering the ideals of gender equity. One of Haden’s most underappreciated achievements was his decision to bring women’s sand volleyball and women’s lacrosse to USC and helping them grow to national contenders in under five seasons. The next athletic director, be it a male or a female, should continue what Haden started and make it a priority to grow USC women’s sports beyond what is required by Title IX. And, per the current trend toward women’s athletics at USC, it’s time to increase the role of women in the athletic department.
If anything, USC should look to other universities where athletic programs are led by female athletic directors. Only about 10 percent of the athletic directors of the entire allegiance of Division I schools are female. Not to mention, according to the Philadelphia Inquirer, out of 120 schools belonging to the Football Bowl — USC included — only seven female athletic directors lead their respective schools’ sports programs.
Sports should not be solely governed by men. Penn State’s Sandy Barbour has entirely transformed the face of the Power Five conferences. Mollie Marcoux made unprecedented, executive decisions at Princeton to route resources to the university’s athletic program.
Ultimately, sports are not, by definition, a boy’s club, and its governing body should not be either. As one of the best schools in one of the best Division I conferences, USC needs to take a meaningful step toward achieving and promoting gender equity within collegiate athletics. Hiring a female athletic director would prove to students and Trojan fans that the University considers this issue a priority.
Daily  Trojan Spring 2016 Editorial Board
Editor’s Note: This post was updated to clarify the wording of a previous version which said “the women’s teams have won all 26 of their championships since 1976.” The women’s teams have won 26 championships since 1976. 
 
 
‘What you’re seeing is how a civilization commits suicide,” says lesbian feminist Camille Paglia. “This PC gender politics thing—the way gender is being taught in the universities—in a very anti-male way, it’s all about neutralization of maleness.”
Here’s what’s weird:
The Left, on the one hand, asserts that there are no differences between men and women; therefore, every vocation, every position type, should reflect the country’s gender ratio. If the ratio is not reflected, it is the result of some injustice, again because there is no reason other than discrimination for fewer women in this or that vocation.  On the other hand, is asserted that having more women in a certain profession or vocation would make it better because it would add something that was missing.  But if there is no difference between men and women, so what could possibly be missing?
Now, if women are truly being discriminated against, this is a problem.  If USC refused to hire women athletic directors simply because of their gender, it would be a serious problem. But this seems better remedied on a case-by-case basis than through a quota.
If women aren’t vying for certain positions, such as athletic director, it might it be because some don’t actually want those positions.  Actually, most women do not want to lead men.  It’s in their biology.   Gender stereotypes (specifically, “the mother myth”) perpetuated throughout our history have deceived the female populace.  Germany’s Angelika Dammann, the “first and only female board member at software giant SAP”: “We are still very far from a situation where it’s as normal for women as for men to WANT both a career and family—even among young women. When you have children, you’re expected to stay home for a significant period; otherwise you are considered a bad mother.”  
So the number of female candidates for certain jobs is severely reduced to, well, sometimes none.  Especially if the pool of them — say USC females familiar with the system already and who want the job — is non-existent.
USC should strongly consider hiring a green eyed AD. They have a long history of brown and blue eyed ADs. USC needs to take a meaningful step toward achieving and promoting eye color equity within collegiate athletics.
If I disagree, there I’m a “hater”?  Oh, well….eat me!
No Problem with a female AD. Anyone other than Steve Lopes, please. A person that has some foresight in hiring coaches  from a real national search not like Haden and current staff who take the easy way out.  Personally winning in Sand Volleyball and Lacrosse is like the ‘ruins getting titles in gymnastics, and softball. It is great for the women, but the alumni doesn’t rally around those minor sports.
The NCAA didn’t offer championships for women until 1981-82, so it was pretty difficult for the Trojans to win any prior to that (there was the AIAW and the like, but they weren’t much older). No school won, say, a women’s basketball championship in 1950, because it didn’t exist. Nearly all of those many men’s track titles that USC won happened well before the women even competed. It’s a false equivalency. A valid comparison would be men’s titles vs. women’s since 1982. 
Also, no where in the NCAA, at any school, is there a “senior men’s administrator” as you seem to suggest.
I’m not even saying your central point isn’t valid, but the lack of depth of knowledge in the subject, as illustrated by these crucial mistakes, tends to lessen the impact. Ignorance isn’t a good place to start an argument.
Your push for a female AD is as insane as Hillary’s comment atating… “isn’t it about time we havery a woman president!”   We want the best person for the jiob, and you shouldn’t make decisions based on genitalia.
Hey Thecatman, your spelling and grammar is insane. Ever hear of editing your comment before submitting it?
This country is overdue for a woman President instead of the likes of a Trump, Cruz, Rubio and the rest of the
haters like yourself. That cigar hanging out of your mouth is disgusting.
Poor baby. Perhaps you should hide in your safe zone.  Momma’s basement is good for that. If all you  can do is bust my chops for an autocorrect error, you have more issues to deal with. Someday, when you grow up an make some money, you too, may enjoy a fine cigar after a USC football win.  Besides, you need to learn to read. You misspelled my nickname.  As always, fight on brothuh!
How about you get the most qualified candidate for the job instead of making sexist comments like “It should be a man” or “It should be a woman”?

“We could lose Wisconsin,” read the email from Hillary for America, mass-dispersed the night before the primary. Well, you did, Hillary. And not because I didn’t chip in $1.
I was admittedly surprised by the shock of Clinton supporters when Sen. Bernie Sanders took Wisconsin. Going into the primary, I can’t say I harbored much optimism — anyone who took a close look at the state could have predicted it. As CNN Politics so succinctly put it, “Wisconsin was the kind of state … that Sanders had to win.”
Here’s the deal on the buzzing Sanders victory: Wisconsin is a state with the demographic makeup of Sanders’ dreams. It incorporates an open primary with a swarm of independents, it’s predominantly white and its second-and-third-largest age groups fall into Sanders’ classically faithful 18-to-35-year-old target demographic. Marking the sixth victory in seven consecutive races, it appears that Sanders is successfully maintaining his fierce momentum. But April 19 is approaching, and New York looks poised and ready to deposit hundreds of delegates into Clinton’s camp. Couple that with the rest of the Clinton-leaning East Coast, and Sanders needs to fight hard to keep his winning streak. Otherwise, if he lets it go before the 19th, the chances of a recovery are doubtful. The objective right now is simple: Sanders needs to expand his appeal to Clinton’s target demographic to win Wyoming. If he loses, he forfeits his momentum just when he needs it — and the game is over.
An open primary — as opposed to a closed one — is a primary in which those without an official party affiliation can still participate. The decision to hold an open or closed primary lies with the state. Wisconsin has previously been considered a swing state for its large population of independent voters, and Sanders happily claimed that demographic for himself, winning independents by a whopping 71-29 percent margin.
We could speculate about why this happened. Loyal Democrats might prefer a longtime member of the party; Sanders has historically been independent despite clearly liberal leanings and independents might shy away from traditional party politics in favor of a non-establishment outsider. Regardless, the independent vote skyrocketed Sanders to a fighting chance.
As previously stated, the second-and-third-largest voter-eligible age groups in the state of Wisconsin fall into Sanders’ loyal youngster division, and this time, Sanders won young people by an even higher margin than usual. He comfortably secured the youth demographic with a 60-point margin, 20 points higher than his average margin with young voters, which clocks in at 40. Sanders’ momentum in the previous election is clearly a contributing factor; historically speaking, the turnout of a millennial crowd can be heavily influenced by the energy of a campaign.
Most importantly, Wisconsin is a state that is heavily white. This is significant particularly because Clinton is highly popular among people of color, who were, for the most part, not represented in this primary.
So kudos to Sanders for his victory — although, to be frank, it should have been a lot more comfortable than it was. Given all of the above Bern-inducing factors, Sanders still only topped Clinton by a 13-point margin — and his delegate allotment exceeds hers by only 10, small in the face of her 250-odd lead (in pledged delegates alone; not to mention the 469 super delegates in her camp, compared to Sanders’ 31).
New York is a state with a large block of loyal, registered Democrats, and one that has already elected Clinton as its senator — not to mention voted for her in her last primary in 2008. Clinton clearly knows how to win New York. Another important note: New York is a closed primary, which means that unregistered young voters and independents — Sanders’ loyal supporters —  will not be able to vote unless they formally register with the Democratic party. Couple that with an older population of politically educated, loyal Democrats plus the presence of a powerful and dominant finance industry and it seems highly unlikely that the SUNY kids and a few hopeful Democrats can put 283 delegates in Sanders’ lap.
In order to have a hope of taking New York — or putting a dent in that delegate count — Sanders needs to maintain the momentum he has accrued through his recent victories. Therefore, he needs to take Wyoming on Saturday. Failing to do so might be a fatal mistake. In order to do so, Sanders needs to take to the offensive: Rather than relying on a few bases, he needs to start appealing to those groups that would traditionally vote for Clinton — the affluent white base and the African-American base. In order to keep his foot in the door, he needs to fight — hard.

Hi, Lily Vaughan.  Thank you for your pro-Bernie perspective.  I can tell you come from a place of idealism.  And it is from that place that Bernie gets all of his supporters.
So bear with me here.  I would like you to know something I’ve learned from my days as an idealistic liberal Democrat at USC.  And the lessons I have since learned that changed my mind.  And I’ll address just one issue so I do not risk boring you.  I think you will agree with what I say since I intend only to use logic and some facts we can agree on.
One of the most important differences between Democrats and Republicans is how each regards the role and the size of the government.
Democrats (usually liberals) believe that the State should be the most powerful force in society. Among many other things, the Government should be in control of educating every child, should provide all health care, and should regulate – often to the minutest detail – how businesses conduct their business. In Germany, for instance, the Government legislates the time of day stores have to close. In short, Democrats believe there should be no power that competes with government.. Not parents, not businesses, not private schools, not religious institutions, not even the individual human conscience.
Republicans (usually conservatives), on the other hand, believe that government’s role in society should be limited to absolute necessities. Such as national defense, and being the resource of last resort: to help citizens who cannot be helped by family, by community, or by religious and secular charities.
Lily Vaughan, Republicans understand that as Government grows in size and power, the following will inevitably happen:
1. There will be ever-increasing amounts of corruption. Power and money breed corruption. People in government will sell government influence for personal and political gain, and people outside of government will seek to buy influence and favors. In Africa and Latin America, government corruption has been the single biggest factor in holding nations back from progressing.
2. Individual liberty will decline. With few exceptions, such as an unrestricted right to abortion, individual liberty is less important to Democrats than to Republicans. This is neither an opinion nor a criticism. It is simple logic: The more control government has over people’s lives, the less liberty people have.
3. Countries with ever-expanding governments will either reduce the size of their government, or eventually collapse economically. Every welfare state ultimately becomes a Ponzi scheme, relying on new payers to pay previous payers, And when it runs out of new payers, the scheme collapses. All of the welfare states of the world – including the wealthy European countries – are already experiencing this problem, to varying degrees.
4. In order to pay for an ever-expanding government, taxes are constantly increased. But at a given level of taxation, the society’s wealth producers will either stop working, work less, hire fewer people, or move their business out of the state or out of the country.
5. Big government produces big deficits and ever increasing and ultimately unsustainable debt. This too is only logical.. The more money the State hands out. The more money people will demand from the state. No recipient of free money has ever said, “Thank you, I have enough.” Unless big governments get smaller, they will all eventually collapse under own weight. With terrible consequences, socially as well as economically.
6. The bigger the government , the greater the opportunities for doing great evil. The 20th century was the most murderous century in recorded history. And who did all this killing? Big governments. Evil individuals without power can only do so much harm. But when evil individuals take control of big government, the amount of harm they can do is essentially unlimited.  Republicans fear Big government. Democrats fear Big Business.
But Coca-Cola cannot break into your house or confiscate your wealth. Only Big Government can do that. As irresponsible as any business has ever been, it is only Big Government that can build concentration camps and commit genocide.
7. Big Government eats away at the moral character of a nation. People no longer take care of other people. After all, they know the government will do that. That’s why Americans give far more of their money and volunteer far more of their time to charity than do Europeans at the same economic level.
Without the belief in an ever-expanding government, there is no Democratic Party. Without a belief in limited government, there is no Republican Party and there is no prosperity and individual liberty. There’s less of everything really.
Thanks for listening, Ms. Vaughan.

People often point to Los Angeles as one of the most diverse counties in the world. With the largest Hispanic, Asian and Native American populations in the nation, it isn’t hard to see the plurality of nationalities like those in the honorary capital of Southern California as an easy case study for those touting America as a melting pot of races and ethnicities.
With recent research highlighting a new pattern of segregation among the city’s ethnic populations, that may well be changing. Previously inclusive neighborhoods such as Covina, Norwalk and Cerritos have gone from relatively diverse to overwhelmingly populated by Latino and Asian immigrants. On the flip side, coastal areas such as Rancho Palos Verdes and Pacific Palisades are overwhelmingly white; a recent map produced by the Weldon Cooper Center for Public Service at the University of Virginia shows Los Angeles as a strikingly segregated area, one in which four races — Asian, black, Latino and white — are sequestered into highly concentrated ethnic neighborhoods. The increasing racial segregation in Los Angeles points toward a disingenuity in political discourse regarding the city’s diversity.
Ethnic enclaves are integral in providing familiar communities and economies for first-generation immigrants, but the recent white flight out of ethnic neighborhoods in Los Angeles is contrary to the purpose of tight-knit ethnic communities. Especially in the past 30 years, white residents have chosen same-race neighborhoods with alarming frequency; in a survey of Chicago residents conducted by Michael Bader, assistant professor of sociology at the American University in Washington, D.C., white residents were more than “2 to 6 times less likely than Latinos to even know about majority Latino neighborhoods.” The results reported suggest real effects; studies show that ethnicity is strongly correlated to levels of public health and education in communities split by color. Real estate in communities of color often drops in value as white residents move out, and governments tend to invest less in community resources. After all, the remarkably low rates of life expectancy, average incomes and educational achievement of neighborhoods like South Los Angeles and Watts highlights this glaring discrepancy.
Segregation in Los Angeles means that the city feels the brunt of unequal resource distribution across different neighborhoods. California’s black and Latino students often attend schools with markedly lower academic performance, and according to The Atlantic, 85 percent of black and 96 percent of Latino students in Los Angeles attend schools where a majority of their peers are poor. Majority-white schools, in contrast, have disproportionately higher resources due to higher property tax incomes from correspondingly wealthier neighborhoods, a valuable resource rarely afforded by black and Latino students. Similarly, a recent LAUSD proposal to create a colocation — and thus the sharing of equipment, rooms, and resources — between Castelar Elementary (an overwhelmingly Asian local elementary school) and Metro Charter School highlights a pressure on ethnic schools which more affluent ones rarely face.
In the face of glaring inequities between immigrant neighborhoods, it isn’t hard to balk at discourse over the city’s multiculturalism. In an interview during his first year of office, Mayor Eric Garcetti describes the city as the “most diverse collection of human beings ever assembled in a single place in human history.” Similarly, tourism pamphlets consistently extol the city as a cultural mecca and the home of considerable multiethnic populations. Though having different perspectives represented is important in any group setting, these shallow interpretations of diversity as a quota of people fail to ignore very tangible needs across the city.
It’s clear that increased investment in Los Angeles’ communities of color is integral in the city’s path to development. The recent move by the Department of Housing that requires grant applicants to prove how their initiatives encourage integration is a step in the right direction. A tax structure that does not correlate the values of residents’ homes with the quality of their children’s education may be another. President Barack Obama’s proposal to further affirmative housing policies highlights yet another positive advancement, but a fundamental shift in ideology must occur for those living in better neighborhoods to understand gaps in opportunity for others.
For students at USC, “diversity” is often a household term. The University consistently boasts of its own status as a global university with one of the largest international student populations, and pamphlets to prospective students assure that students don’t forget. But inclusion must go further in protecting a community, rather than building a desired demographic. The recently passed campus climate resolution provides real opportunities toward creating tangible benefits for students of color. But even so, real power lies with administrative decisions toward increasing spaces for cultural centers, investing more in surrounding neighborhoods and facilitating more discussion over diversity at the University. As a truly global school situated in a truly global city, USC could learn the lesson of the meaning of diversity, just as local policymakers should.
Specious.

Every now and then, there are days like this that the sun doesn’t shine in California. Personally, I love it. I think that California has too many weeks where the sun just won’t quit, but I should know what to expect by now. Don’t get me wrong; I love the sun just as much as anyone else, but a break from the norm every once in awhile is a welcome change.
Whenever the clouds come out to have their time in the spotlight, some songs in my rotation get more plays than they usually do, since they have the perfect aesthetic to match the gray skies. They aren’t sad songs — though those are fair game too.  They’re just chiller than songs I’d usually listen to with blue skies and the sun beating down on me. They’re not all rainy day songs either, but most of them are pretty close.
With a cloudy day playlist like this, it’s important to keep a good mix between softer and brighter songs without compromising the overall chill tone of it all. It might be cloudy outside, but it’s not raining yet, so avoid anything that’s going to make you cry or remind you of something that will make you cry. Save those for the rainy days. Rather, enjoy the cool air and the monochrome skies that shake up the usual sunshine with some songs that will make you appreciate the cloudy days.

Erika Lee | Daily Trojan
“Parent Trap” is a feature that showcases the love stories of Trojan parents, as told by their kids. If your parents have a one-of-a-kind tale to tell, share it with us at dailytrojanblogs@gmail.com!  
Throughout most of my life, I’ve never actually wondered how my parents fell in love. I don’t know why, but it was only recently that I asked them to tell me the story of how it happened.
I’ve heard bits and pieces throughout my childhood — my dad immigrated to America from Taiwan while my mom emigrated from Hong Kong and they ended up working at the same bank together. While working at United National Bank, somehow something sparked between them. They worked at the loan department of the bank, where my mom was a loan processor and my dad was the loan department manager.
“Though he is very hardworking he yelled when things aren’t done the right way,” my mom said of my dad as her boss more than 30 years ago. “I came home crying to grandma so many times and she constantly asked me why I liked him.”
Their first “date” started when my mom and a couple of other co-workers at the bank planned to go bowling together. They were supposed to go out as a group but nobody else showed up. They spent a lot of time together that night and realized that they really liked each other. They started dating shortly after but kept it a secret at work. They recalled the thrill of clandestine meetings, the exchange of knowing glances across the room and the speculation of “do you think anybody knows?”on the phone at night. 
Even today, my dad has a different personality when it comes to work. He’s considerate, funny and kind when we are at home. But when it comes to work, he’s cold, demanding and short-tempered. I find it extremely amusing to imagine my parents in a work environment together, with this type of dynamic, especially since my mom calls all the shots at home.
Erika Lee | Daily Trojan
When I asked my parents about their first date, my dad didn’t remember what happened, but my mom did. It made me feel sad that he didn’t remember. How could someone be married and not remember something as significant as their first date? My mom said that after 28 years of marriage, things change and a lot of things aren’t worth being nitpicky over anymore.
She told me that it’s impossible to expect love to last forever. She said to me that even when I get married someday, I should never build my life around somebody in a way that makes me dependent on their affection for survival. She said it isn’t so much about never trusting them, but more about being able to derive self-worth from within and not another person. I can only hope to one day be as resilient and independent as she. 
Everybody wants to believe that their parents are still as madly in love as they were when they met, but that isn’t realistic and it isn’t what always happens.
We read novels of timeless love and epic grandeur and wish that we could have that for ourselves. Once in awhile, we come across people who have somehow lit the match of love, with their relationship still burning just as brightly after decades past. We watch in awe at the rarity. We think that they are the lucky ones.
I used to believe that the only sort of love worth having was romantic and passionate, that the person that I imagine someday marrying must love me same way until we grow old — but then I realized that love exists in so many ways. Love is so fleeting — it doesn’t have to be wild and all-consuming in order to be extraordinary. It could be a steady hand to hold, a listening ear on a bad day, someone who chooses to try. Companionship and consistency is just as rare and valuable, if not more, than lust and desire.
Even though my parents’ love has changed, I feel glad to have been able to help them revisit their beginnings.
I am half of two amazing people that both really love me and the greatest love of all is the one that they gave to me.
I think that makes me the lucky one.

To me, this series sounds intrusive and kind of embarrassing. Why would anyone want to divulge their parents’ love stories? That’s silly.

As I turned the page of my calendar from March to April over the weekend, I had the sudden realization that I could now see the rest of my college career on one page. A mere five weeks is all that is keeping me from becoming a college graduate. 
It’s hard to wrap my mind around the fact that this is my last month as an undergraduate student, when it seems like I just moved into New/North as a freshman a mere weeks ago, instead of almost four years ago. 
Whether I am ready for them or not, things are starting to happen that are confirming the inevitable — that I’ll be leaving the place I’ve called home for the past four years in just five weeks. On Sunday my club lacrosse team celebrated Senior Day, and sent eight of us (seven of us that have all played on the team together since we were freshmen) off with some parting words. On Monday I scheduled my first real job interview, and on Tuesday I bought my graduation sash. 
In the next month,  I’ll have senior dinners, last practices, last classes, last meetings and just in general a lot of “lasts” of my college experience. 
It’s hard to imagine how I got to this point when I feel like it was just yesterday that I was cleaning out my high school locker. My grandma had called me to see how my last day of school went, and she asked me if I thought the last four years went by too quickly. “It seems like I was a freshman just yesterday. I don’t know where the time went,” I told her. She told me to wait and see how fast college would go by. 
A couple days ago I was on on the phone with her again, this time walking back to my car after leaving work, when she asked if I remembered that conversation four years ago. 
“Like it was yesterday,” I said. 
Thinking about how quickly time goes by is overwhelming. When I look back and reflect on the last four years, I find myself thinking about whether or not I’ve done everything I’ve wanted to during the last four years, and if I’ve made the best of use of my time at USC. Did I spend enough time with people I care about? Did I take the right classes? Did I learn all the important lessons and take advantage of all the opportunities at my disposal as a student? 
Honestly, I probably haven’t, but I’m starting to realize that’s okay. 
I’ve come to the conclusion that looking back at the “could have, should have” moments isn’t really a good use of the short time I have left at USC. Neither is putting so much emphasis on this being the the end of an era of my life. 
There will always be things that I could have done, should have done, maybe shouldn’t have done, but there’s no use revisiting those moments now unless it’s for a few laughs. 
It’s natural to have a fear of time moving too fast for us to keep up with. But a better use of our precious time, I’ve realized, is to not be so nostalgic that we’re obsessing about the past, or so focused on the future that we are overwhelmed by the unknown. This might be one of the hardest things I’ve done throughout my four years at USC, but for the next five weeks I’m going to try to hang out right here in the present.

As summer approaches, many students are doing their best to find internships around the City of Los Angeles or closer to home. However, three USC graduates and one current student set their sights further, working as part of the Obama Administration during internships this semester.
Alex Glazer and Lucy Moore graduated in December 2015 and are completing a White House internship before pursuing graduate school. Glazer and Moore both majored in political science. Another recent graduate, Linda Wang, and Christina Wilkes, a current junior majoring in communication and political science, also were selected for the internship program.
Both Glazer and Moore obtained the White House internships through online applications posted on the White House Internship Program’s website. Glazer has previously held internships in other levels of government, but did not expect to be given the chance to work in the White House with the Obama Administration.
“This has been a once-in-a-lifetime experience to not only intern in the executive branch, but to intern for a president who I deeply admire,” Glazer said in an email to the Daily Trojan. “I vividly remember watching then-Sen. Obama give his victory speech on election night in November 2008 when I was just a freshman in high school. I never imagined that seven years later I would have the privilege of interning in his administration during his last year in office.”
Moore also worked in a political setting during her time at USC, and hoped for an opportunity to work in the field of public service at this level.
“Throughout high school, and while I was at USC, I had a number of political internships but always had the White House in the back of my mind for the future,” Moore said in an email to the Daily Trojan. “As someone who is interested in pursuing a career in public service, there is no better experience, and it was always my dream. Having the opportunity to intern for the Obama Administration, which has made great progress on many of the issues I care most about, is a huge privilege.”
Glazer is interning in the Office of Presidential Correspondence, one of the oldest and largest offices in the White House.  The office is responsible for all correspondence with the President, and President Obama has requested ten letters from the public each day to gauge how his policies affect people.
Moore is interning in the National Economic Council, which is a forum on economic issues utilized by the President himself.
“I help with research, scheduling requests, administrative support and meeting coordination. I also work closely with staff doing in-depth research and logistics,” Moore said. “Working in such a fast-paced and dynamic environment, I have had to learn how to manage my time and prioritize the most important things, even more than I had to in college. That is a really important skill that I will carry with me throughout my career.”
Glazer’s future plans include a law degree and possibly a career in political communication. Moore plans to stay in the Capitol, and pursue public policy issues, especially those which concern women.
“I think I will likely still be in the D.C. area, working in the public policy realm, but whether that’s in the federal government or elsewhere, I’m not sure.” Moore said. “I’m really passionate about working on policy that expands women’s access to economic opportunities, so hopefully I can find a way to work that into my career.”

Ray Jayawardhana, one of three candidates being considered for the position of dean of the USC Dornsife College of Letters, Arts and Sciences, spoke Wednesday to about 50 students and staff members about his professional background and future goals for the school if he were to be selected for the job. In addition to being a writer, Jayawardhana is currently the dean of science and a professor of physics and astronomy at York University in Canada.
“I understand your president very much likes to say that Dornsife is ‘the beating heart’ of the University,” Jayawardhana said. “As such, I think there is a huge opportunity for Dornsife to really build on and engage the strength that it already has and truly become a premier institution globally for a wide range of disciplines.”
Jayawardhana mentioned how the Dornsife school’s substantial size could be seen as divided.
“That also makes it a little hard to have a brand, to have a unifying vision and a unifying way of being seen by the outside world as well as internally,” Jayawardhana said.
But Jayawardhana also affirmed the unity of Dornsife.
“While it’s challenging, I firmly believe that the arts, the humanities, the social sciences, the sciences, are all just really different ways of exploring what it is to be human, to learn about the human condition in all its diverse and fascinating forms,” Jayawardhana said. “So they are really all part of the intellectual enterprise, and therefore there is a unifying, very deep basis for a college like this, and there is no reason to not acknowledge that very openly, repeatedly and clearly.”
His ideas for improving Dornsife include increasing educational quality, promoting diversity and enhancing access to faculty and staff. Additionally, he hopes to have broader engagement across local, national and international bounds and create a fellowship program.
“If it’s possible, [I would want] to develop a cross-disciplinary, postdoctoral fellowship program that’s a named, prestigious fellowship,” Jayawardhana said. “The thing that really appeals to me is what these people — emerging top scholars from around the world — who come spend two or three years here, do afterwards.”
Also, Jayawardhana plans to engage with local, national and global communities.
“I have a longstanding interest in broader engagement,” Jayawardhana said. “That’s engagement with the local community. That’s engagement globally. I’ve found really interesting that public outreach, media engagement and impact actually comes back in many different ways.”
This sense of community is also promoted from the school’s diversity.
“The excellence and the diversity go together,” Jayawardhana said.
Ultimately, Jayawardhana hopes to have a lasting impact if he is chosen to be dean of Dornsife.
“Frankly at Dornsife I think, partly because of the scale and diversity of the structures, of the 30-some research institutes and 30-some departments, I don’t think the dean can have an impact in a very short time,” Jayawardhana said. “I certainly wouldn’t want to come here unless I felt I could stay long enough to have an impact that actually makes a difference because that’s the appeal of the job.”
Richard Fliegal, associate dean for undergraduate programs, commented on the candidate.
“He seems like a very decent guy with a good sense of humor,” Fliegal said. “He has a very nice humanistic perspective. He’s a scientist. He values the humanities. This is somebody who seems to know well how to work with colleagues. He seems like a great candidate.”
Provost and Senior Vice President for Academic Affairs Michael Quick has not released the names of the two other candidates.
“One of these three people may well be the next dean of the college,” Fliegal said. “This is a real opportunity to get some insight into all of them, so we’ll see which way the Provost goes.”
Fliegal was already very impressed with Jayawardhana.
“He seems like he would be a wonderful choice if the provost chose to go this way,” Fliegal said.
