USC and UCLA might have one of the nation’s most heated rivalries, but USC coach Richard Gallien isn’t buying into the hype.
“We want to tone down the USC-UCLA rivalry,” Gallien said. “Tennis isn’t a sport you play when you’re overly emotional. When emotions are too high that just makes it harder.”
Breath of fresh air · Freshman Kaitlyn Christian has been a force for USC this season, and looks to continue her strong play at UCLA. - Murugappan Aroonachalam | Daily Trojan 
Coming off of a physically and mentally taxing bout with San Diego on Friday, the No. 15 USC women’s tennis team (7-1) will look to avenge last year’s two losses to the Lady Bruins.
Led by  No. 1 singles player, senior Maria Sanchez, this USC team is a much more mature bunch than the previous group that was defeated by UCLA.
Riding a 16-match winning streak, Sanchez has been a dominant force for the Women of Troy this spring, dispatching some of the nation’s top competition in the process, including four top-10 players.
Despite her recent success, Gallien knows Sanchez’s journey is far from over.
“Naturally, whoever she plays will be excited. Maria is a pretty grounded kid and isn’t caught up in it,” Gallien said. “It’s a neat deal and she has a lot more matches left. She knows the goal is to keep improving both [for] now and her professional career.”
Sanchez will likely face off against No. 73 McCall Jones in the top singles match later today.
A combined seven singles players are nationally ranked heading into today’s match, not to mention the five doubles teams who are also among the nation’s best.
An interesting match slated for tomorrow is the third-slotted singles match, since both teams have been tinkering to find a stable player to man the spot.
Although the Bruins have been known to move around their lineups depending on the matchups, Gallien’s squad has had very little movement among its top six spots.
Junior Alison Ramos’ struggles, combined with the rise of freshman Kaitlyn Christian, have seen the duo swap spots in the singles lineup with Christian moving to No. 3 last week.
UCLA most recently used its top-ranked player at the third position, No. 64 Andrea Remynse, but no matter who she plays, Christian will have her hands full keeping her hot streak going.
Another possible thriller rests in the No. 5 singles match, where sophomore Valeria Pulido will put her eight-match winning streak to the test against probable starter No. 119 Carling Seguso, who has an 11-match winning streak of her own in play.
Two storied programs, both of which are nationally ranked, are sure to produce fireworks. Add in the rivalry between USC and UCLA, and this match has significant implications.
As always, though, Gallien wants to put the match into perspective.
“They have an excellent, solid team from top to bottom. We have had some success there in the past despite last year’s hiccup,” he said. “[This year] we will be ready.”
The match is set to start at 1:30 p.m. in Westwood, Calif.
FIGHT ON!! BEAT THE bruins!!!

The No. 7 USC men’s swim team heads to Long Beach, Calif. today to start competition at the Pac-10 championships.
Similar to the women’s team, the men’s team is focusing on qualifying as many swimmers for the NCAA championships as possible. Thirteen Trojans have already qualified.
“The original plan was to pick up the times we would need to get to the NCAA meet and forge ahead from that point, not looking at the dual meets as critically important,” said USC coach Dave Salo. “We are looking at this [Pac-10s] as a stepping-stone for the NCAAs.”
Leading USC at Pac-10s will be two All-Americans, sophomore Clement Lefert and junior Patrick White, and freshman Vladimir Morozov. The team lost its last two competitions, but has a chance to redeem itself at the Pac-10s against the same two teams it fell to: California and Stanford.
The frontrunners at the Pac-10 championships are the No. 1 Golden Bears and the No. 2 Cardinal, with the No. 6 Wildcats also pushing for a spot in the top three. Although the Trojans will have their work cut out for them, these are the only three teams ranked higher than USC that will be competing.
“We never know what we’re going to get from Arizona at the meet,” Salo said. “If they are true to form, they might bypass their focus on this meet and we could make a run at the top three.”
The Cardinal traditionally prepares for the Pac-10s by resting the majority of its team, resulting in solid performances from the Stanford swimmers year after year. That is motivation enough for the Trojans to want to beat their NorCal rival.
“Everyone wants to see Stanford lose because they are always resting for Pac-10s,” said senior co-captain Dillon Connolly. “Whereas Cal, which is a much better team at NCAAs, is resting for NCAAs. Out-touching Stanford would be great.”
The team’s main focus is also on the NCAAs, but, like Cal, there  are still lofty anticipation for the Pac-10 Championships among the squad.
The competition starts tonight at 6 p.m. with the 200-yard medley and 800-yard free relay and continues through Saturday.
“In different ways, it [the Pac-10 championships] is more intense than NCAAs,” Connolly said. “There’s less pressure on the NCAA qualifiers since we are already set, but everyone still gets pumped up.”

There comes a time in every relationship when the obvious question arises: Can I see this lasting?
I recently had to face this daunting question and make an inquiry into the depths of my sports-loving soul.
My relationship, however, has nothing to do with another human being, but rather the USC men’s basketball team.
How do I determine whether or not to continue to follow a season that has been nothing short of a heart attack waiting to happen?
It’s quite simple, really: with a trip down the topsy-turvy memory lane that has been the 2010-2011 season.
From the first time I laid eyes on this team during the Cardinal and Gold scrimmage, it was far from love at first sight.
The team’s depth deficiencies, predictable offensive schemes and inexperience as a unit were apparent.
But what hooked me was the Trojans’ potential. This team would not be a Pac-10 powerhouse or a fixture in the national headlines, but there was a subtle attractiveness, despite its obvious flaws.
Our first few dates passed the eye test with wins over UC Irvine and Santa Clara.
Just when I thought this team could rid itself of its preseason problems, however, the Rider Broncs came to town and shattered the image I had so naively created, with a 77-57 rout Nov. 17.
Over the next month, my relationship with USC basketball was about as shaky as James Franco’s hosting performance during Sunday’s Academy Awards.
There were moments of jubilation, such as when the Trojans knocked off then-No. 18 Tennessee in their house and then took it to the then-No. 20 Longhorns two weeks later at the Galen Center.
There were moments of disbelief, particularly when a last-second out-of-bounds call on junior guard Jio Fontan cost the team a chance to knock off Kansas at historic Phog Allen Fieldhouse Dec. 18.
And there were moments of utter disappointment — the kind that makes you regret ever getting involved. Losses to Nebraska, TCU and Bradley speak for themselves.
Then the Pac-10 portion of the schedule came. Even though the Trojans won two of their first three games in conference, I should have sensed that things hadn’t really changed at all.
From poor guard play to a disgruntled freshman and non-existent perimeter defense, the next nine games challenged my faith and my patience.
Six losses to the likes of inferior Oregon, Oregon State and California pushed me to the edge.
How could this team, the one I had learned to love even with its flaws, crumble when it mattered most?
But just when I began to believe our best days truly were behind us, the Trojans desperately fought back.
A two-game sweep of the Bay Area schools for the first time since 1992, an upset of then-No. 10 Arizona and a dominating senior night victory over ASU brought me back temporarily, although with much trepidation.
With two games to play this weekend in Washington, and at least one game guaranteed in the Pac-10 tournament, the fork in the road leaves me to ask whether this ride deserves one more leap of faith.
Yes, there is stability with junior forward Nikola Vucevic, who has recorded 18 double-doubles and leads the team in points and rebounds.
Yes, it’s hard not to feel safe and secure with senior forwards Marcus Simmons, who has shut down Klay Thompson, Tyshawn Taylor and Jordan Hamilton.
Alex Stepheson, who leads the team in blocks and has recorded at least eight games of 14 rebounds or more.
And the tempo that guards Maurice Jones and Jio Fontan play with is exhilarating at times.
But with my heart and mind glued to the present, can I neglect the hair-pulling moments and long nights of serious reflection?
The answer is, in a word, yes.
They might or might not dance at the NCAA’s senior prom this month. Their coach will never be the next Mike Krzyzewski or Bob Knight. And you’d be hard-pressed to find a banner commemorating this group next year in the Galen Center’s rafters.
But, in my best tear-filled Terrell Owens impersonation: This is my basketball team.

The last time UCLA came to Marks Stadium, on April 16, 2010,  things turned sour for the USC men’s tennis team as it was handed its first conference loss in the team’s last match of the Pac-10 season.
Rise to the top · Junior Steve Johnson has won 21 of his last 24 matches and was crowned the No. 1 player in the nation Tuesday. - Mannat Saini | Daily Trojan 
USC still snatched the 2010 Pac-10 title, but the victory was made bittersweet by the unsettling 4-3 loss to its crosstown rival.
This year, No. 7 USC is determined to turn things around against visiting No. 6 UCLA when the two teams compete today at 3 p.m. In arguably the biggest match of the season, USC looks to protect its turf and come out with a dominant win.
“Last year we lost on our home courts in the Pac-10 tournament and we don’t want that again,” said junior Steve Johnson.
For many, today’s match is personal, especially as the Trojans look to continue their streak of consistent play that began with a 5-1 win last weekend against Stanford.
“We’d definitely like to get a big win, especially on our home courts,” Johnson said.
The Bruins are coming off a 5-2 upset by No. 20 California last weekend and are looking to make a comeback against USC.
Even though this marks the first Trojan-Bruin matchup of the tennis season, USC coach Peter Smith has emphasized the team must not treat this match that differently, even if a victory might taste extra sweet.
“We definitely approach these matches just like any other match,” said junior Daniel Nguyen. “We know every team is talented so we prepare ourselves to compete.”
The Trojans looked a little shaken against Cal last weekend coming off of their close loss at the ITA Indoor Championships, but came ready to play against the Cardinal.
Re-energizing focus, especially at this midway point in the season, seems to have made all the difference.
“The most important thing is to focus on the stuff we can control, such as improving in our doubles, singles and our fitness to help prevent these injuries,” Nguyen said.
In recent weeks, UCLA has been all the more dangerous. In the ITA Indoor Championships, the Bruins beat No. 10 Florida 4-3 and No. 15 Louisville 4-1, both of whom are upcoming opponents for USC.
Despite the success of their crosstown counterparts, the players know they must prepare and focus on their game.
“Our team goal is to continue to play at a high level and not worry about the wins or losses,” Nguyen said. “I think [we] really just [need to] take it one point at a time and play our hearts out.”
Fight on mighty men of Troy…  two time defending Champs.  We Love your work

USC coach Frank Cruz has referred to his team as “prizefighters,” but they’re still searching for that knockout punch.
For the fourth consecutive game, the Trojans (3-5) blew a lead, battled back from a deficit and had their fair share of chances to win the game.
Not enough · Senior second baseman Joe DePinto, pictured here at home against Missouri, drove in three runs Tuesday night, but they weren’t enough as the Trojans eventually fell to host Long Beach State, 5-4. - Carlo Acenas | Daily Trojan 
But Tuesday night, it was Long Beach State freshman pinch-hitter Johnny Bekakis who delivered the knockout blow, singling home the winning run off junior closer Chad Smith with one out in the bottom of the ninth to give the Dirtbags a 5-4 win.
It’s the Trojans fourth straight loss and the third by just one run.
The Trojans struck right off the bat in the first. After junior catcher Kevin Roundtree doubled and junior first baseman Ricky Oropesa reached on an error, senior captain and second baseman Joe De Pinto got USC on the board. With a full count, De Pinto ripped a two-RBI two-bagger down the left field line to give the Trojans a quick 2-0 lead.
The Dirtbags threatened in their half of the first, putting runners at the corners with one down. But junior pitcher Ben Mount got out of the jam by inducing a lineout double-play to freshman James Roberts at shortstop.
Mount pitched well, allowing a bunt RBI in the second but otherwise mowing through the Long Beach State lineup until his defense let him down in the fifth inning, as the Dirtbags evened the score at two.
Mount was lifted from the game after the fifth inning, after allowing just one earned run on five hits and striking out four. The Dirtbags took advantage of Mount’s exit.
A leadoff single, a sacrifice bunt and a bloop double that kicked chalk on the left field line gave Long Beach State the lead. Sophomore pitcher Matt Munson entered to try to squash the rally, but designated hitter Jonathan Kim smacked Munson’s first pitch down the left field line for a double, giving the Dirtbags a 4-2 lead.
USC got the runs back in the seventh inning, as freshman centerfielder Omar Cotto Lozada flashed his speed. He led off with an infield single, advanced to second on a passed ball, went to third on a sacrifice bunt and scored on a wild pitch.
After a walk and a wild pitch put Roundtree on second base, De Pinto came through with the clutch hit USC hadn’t found in a week. He ripped a single to right field plating Roundtree to tie the game. The Trojans couldn’t regain the lead, however, and the Dirtbags capitalized in the ninth.

USC Best Buddies, an organization that partners with disabled elementary school students in Los Angeles, is collaborating with USC’s co-ed cinema fraternity, Delta Kappa Alpha, in promoting the national campaign “Spread the Word to End the Word,” which seeks to rid everyday vocabulary of the “R-word.”
The campaign will attempt to publicize the message that the words “retard” and “retarded” are derogatory to people who are affected by disabilities. The groups will ask students to sign pledges to stop using the words.
Delta Kappa Alpha and Best Buddies believe the campaign will  increase the level of respect given to people with special needs.
Though the cinema fraternity does not have a direct connection to those with disabilities, the members were inspired to join the campaign because actor John C. McGinley is a national spokesperson for “Spread the Word to End the Word.”
Amelia Swedeen, a sophomore majoring in cinema television production and the philanthropy chair for Delta Kappa Alpha, said the partnership with Best Buddies originated out of a separate but common interest in this event.
“Best Buddies was a group that I knew was already doing this event, so I thought it would be a lot more powerful to put them together and make it one big event,” she said.
Swedeen said students often do not understand how much one word can hurt another’s feelings.
“We want to promote respect and encourage people to not use certain words,” Swedeen said. “You hear this word in every day speech, especially with college students. They use it for anything they don’t like and they think is stupid or anything that is negative, but they don’t realize that the word cuts very deep.”
Ashley Elizabeth, a junior majoring in theatre, said she thinks getting students to sign a pledge will make a difference in their use of the word.
“If you spread enough awareness of the reality of the word, how degrading it is and untruthful, it will make people think twice before they say it out loud,” Elizabeth said.
Certain words that are targeted toward a specific race or orientation are not accepted by the public as everyday language, but Swedeen said the same attention is not given to the “R-word.”
“[Retard] is the one word that is completely acceptable in society and media,” Swedeen said. “So that’s what we want to stop. We want to let people know that they can say that if they want, they have the freedom, but they are going to get called out for it.”
Eryn Parker, a senior majoring in English and communication and president of Best Buddies, said she hopes this event will make students conscious of their word choices.
“The more you raise awareness with anything, the more people will think about it,” Parker said. “And then it will get rooted in their vocabulary.”
Andy Dulcan, a junior majoring in cinema-television production and member of Delta Kappa Alpha, said this campaign is especially important because it promotes awareness.
“Awareness is the most crucial step in change, a lot of people don’t know the harm that they are causing with words since it originates in middle school, where you’re saying it before you even know what it is that you are saying,” Dulcan said. “The only way to make that change is for people to understand the long-term effects.”
Kacie Amacher, a freshman majoring in biochemistry, said she is excited students are raising awareness about this subject.
“It’s important that people understand that their words, however unintentional, can have a negative effect on others and that they need to be more aware of what is coming out of their mouths,” Amacher said.
In my opinion the campaign to “Spread the Word to End the Word” does not target “cruel people”.   People who are cruel are purposeful in their actions and use of words.  And, like you said Ras, those who take the pledge would not use this word.  The campaign is meant to raise the awareness of people who use the R-word without really thinking about it’s meaning. Raising awareness about the R-word is about opening one’s eyes to the real world where people are ignorant and they don’t even know it.  Did you know that President Obama signed Rosa’s law to ban the use of the R-word in legislative documents?
After we scrub out this word, what is next? Should we ban “fat” since it can also cause discomfort and pain to obese people that are within earshot of its use? Only in LA can we feel so good about pursuing a symbolic solution to an imaginary problem. 
The problem is not the word, the problem is cruel, ignorant people who would use this word in a hurtful manner. The irony with this cause is that the people who are willing to make the pledge are the same ones that would not be this hurtful in the first place. Do we think the cruel people who would use this word in a hurtful manner just automatically disappear if we campaign to remove a word from our lexicon? This is like a child closing his eyes thinking anything scary in front of him will also disappear. 
We have to stop this retarded logic in this city where we think if we go from “South Central Los Angeles” to “South Los Angeles” we automatically fix the ghettos. These symbolic word games only produce the harmful charade that we are doing something about the problem when all we accomplish is touching the problem. How about curing cancer by eliminating the word…?
Let’s all be adults and not build “word jails” for words that we think COULD be used in a harmful manner. BTW, would “Flame Retardant” be approved under this signed pledge or would all pledgees have to rework the Fire Codes…? If we are so distrustful of letting people speak their minds and let them be subject to the court of public opinion, then perhaps we are slowly advocating for a dumbed down society where the collective scrubs out and approves language for the individuals. We can slowly grind ourselves down where there are no provocative thoughts but just a safe, middle ground, common denominator of plain vanilla, politically correct thoughts.

Tenure is not a topic on the minds of most undergraduate students, but Laura Pulido, professor of American studies and ethnicity, is working to change that.
Exposure · Laura Pulido, professor of American studies and ethnicity, talked about the importance of student involvement in the tenure process. - Jennifer Schultz | Daily Trojan 
Pulido, the founder of the Committee for Tenure Justice at USC, held a presentation for faculty, staff and students yesterday to discuss her “Tenure Bill of Rights,” which consists of 13 changes she hopes the University Committee on Appointments, Promotions & Tenure will enact in the future when determining who receives tenure.
“I see some big problems with the tenure process at USC,” Pulido said. “I’d like to see USC move toward a more open and transparent tenure process … Right now that is not our reputation in any way, shape or form. USC is becoming quite known as the institution where tenure is basically a crapshoot.”
Once professors receive tenure, Pulido explained, their positions at a university are permanent. Professors at USC are eligible for tenure consideration after six years of teaching. When tenure is denied, they are only guaranteed a position at the university for one more year, to give them time to find other employment.
The process is generally seen as one that cannot be swayed by faculty or student input, though Pulido is convinced that if undergraduates speak out, they will play a larger role in the process.
“The more people are talking about it, the more the institution will need to respond to the issues we’re raising … once [undergrads] begin to show that they’re invested in the process, we’ll begin to see some changes,” Pulido said.
Pulido, as well as other professors, believe USC lacks transparency in how its tenure process is handled. Her complaints include secrecy about who sits on UCAPT, what criteria are used in the decision-making process and why professors applying for tenure are denied.
“She pointed out some things that people of authority should look at, points that should be evaluated,” said Felix Gutierrez, a professor at the Annenberg School for Communication & Journalism.
Pulido said tenure is an important issue for the entire campus.
“For students it’s obviously really important in terms of keeping around teachers that they learn from, that they value, in some cases that they love, and when professors leave because they don’t get tenure, that can be really devastating,” she said.
Brittney Pottenger, a junior majoring in industrial and systems engineering, said she’d be willing to help professors by filling out more questionnaires during professor evaluations at the end of the year.
“When professors achieve tenure, they start teaching in unorthodox ways because they can’t get fired,” Pottenger said.
Right now, Pulido said, professors are just hoping for less secrecy.
“When someone is being rejected, you’re being told you’re not good enough without an explanation,” Pulido said.
Representatives from the College of Letters, Arts & Sciences, the Viterbi School of Engineering and the Marshall School of Business were not available for comment.

At real universities, the emphasis is on academic excellence and integrity. This is impossible if professors are treated as workers under a corporate hierarchy, opposed to being held to the ideals of what an institution of higher education are founded on (e.g. what USC claims to be founded on), which you have conveniently belittled as a matter of undergraduate self-esteem. Unless, of course, the decades-long process of high education’s degradation should just be accepted without resistance.
I plan to do all I can to support this issue, beyond merely filling out satisfaction surveys. Public education is already a dying breed. While I am still in a position of paying tuition I will use any sway I may have to keep some decency in education on the most immediate level I can, at my own school.
Well said, M.K.
Good for you. Somehow I don’t think anyone’s listening. Enjoy whatever job your comm degree gets you.
Ignoring your uncritical and reactionary tone, I consider this a challenge I will accept.
In real fields (e.g., not American Studies), tenured professors cater to the research elements of the university, not to making undergraduates feel good about themselves.

A 2009 study conducted by USC Health Promotion and Prevention Services found striking differences between health-related issues that undergraduate and graduate students identified as threatening to academic success, and HPPS is now preparing to see if that trend has remained constant over the last two years.
The report, compiled every two years by the USC American College Health Association as part of their National College Health Assessment, surveys students on a number of health and safety issues, including stress, sexual behavior and alcohol usage.
One category in the report is “health, wellness, and academic success,” which examines the various health-related problems that can impede academic performance. The report compares the frequency of these problems in undergraduate and graduate students at USC, as well as their perceived threat to academic success.
Anxiety, sleep difficulties, cold, flu or sore throat, stress and Internet use and computer games were deemed high-risk threats to academic success for undergraduates because of the large number of students who experienced these problems, and the fact that a high percentage of students indicated these issues impacted their academic performance.
For graduate students, on the other hand, no such issues were deemed high-risk for academics, though Internet use and computer games, anxiety and stress were among the top issues that appeared to be affecting graduates.
“What the [results] say to me is that either one of two things has happened by the time you get into grad school,” said HPPS director Paula Swinford. “One is you’ve learned to manage some situations better, or you didn’t get into grad school.”
Though graduate students did report fewer of these problems impeding academic success, Swinford still wants to make sure HPPS addresses the well-being of this student population. Swinford sees them as more isolated than undergraduates, who HPPS can reach out to more globally through university housing. With graduate students, HPPS has tried to work more with the specific schools.
“Even though there is nothing in the high-frequency, high-threat category, it’s concerning to me because a grad student who is having trouble with the Internet or is anxious or is having stress difficulties, in some ways there aren’t many eyes there to help them manage that or notice that,” Swinford said.
Swinford said the results were somewhat expected, but fourth-year graduate student Genevieve Carpio said she was surprised by them.
“On the one hand, I’m not surprised computer games and social networking are large distractions for undergraduates,” said Carpio, who is studying American studies and ethnicity. “On the other hand, I don’t think that anxiety, sleep difficulties, colds, stress or the Internet become any less of a distraction when someone graduates from college and enters a doctoral or masters program.”
Carpio suspects one reason for these results is that graduate students might rank non-health related issues, such as getting research funding, as more important barriers to academic success.
Sarah Patellos, a sophomore majoring in communication, agrees that undergraduate students face a different set of problems than graduate students.
“When adjusting to college, you deal with different stresses like living on your own and taking care of yourself, so all the stress of life in general has a bigger toll,” Patellos said. “Whereas in grad school, that’s what you signed up for and you have already had four years in college to work through those issues.”
An underlying note to all the results, Swinford said, is the difference between the adolescent and 20-something brain. According to an article published by the Community Prevention Institute, the brain is still maturing into the early 20s, putting adolescents at an elevated risk for many of the problems addressed in the HPPS report, especially substance use.
The study of student health at USC will be replicated again this spring.
Yes….. cough & cold affects my performance :(

Legendary Celtic punk rock band the Dropkick Murphys has gained much notoriety over the years for its feisty energy. Its new album, Going Out in Style, continues that tradition, but also takes things up a notch, as a concept album celebrating the life of the fictional character Cornelius Larkin.
That’s life · Going Out in Style presents the story of the fictional character Cornelius Larkin and weaves in the personal background of the band. The album also includes a track recorded with Bruce Springsteen. - Photo courtesy of Kristine Ashton-Magnuson 
Beginning with a raucous wake, the record becomes a retrospective of Larkin’s life, detailing the Irish immigrant’s journey to America, the relationships he formed and the trials and tribulations he faced, such as the Korean War.
Inspired by the stories of the band members’ grandparents, there is tangible emotion throughout the album, which, in conjunction with the masterful song construction, makes this the best Dropkick Murphys release yet.
Al Barr (lead vocals), Ken Casey (bass/lead vocals), Tim Brennan (guitars, accordion, whistles and vocals), Jeff DaRosa (banjo, bouzouki, mandolin, harmonica and vocals), Matt Kelly (drums and vocals), James Lynch (guitars and vocals) and Scruffy Wallace (bagpipes) get things started with a bang as the record opens with the rousing battle cry, “Hang ’Em High.”
The song features military-style drums along with group vocals, especially in the soaring chorus. It is Larkin’s recounting of his rowdy wake and features a fantastic banjo solo in the bridge.
“Going Out in Style” is the track that gives listeners their first in-depth introduction to the character, the song detailing the challenges, successes and mischief Larkin has seen in his life.
The album, however, does not always achieve the same quality; “Memorial Day” is one of the few disappointments. It’s important to the story, but the vocals and arrangements here are lackluster and ultimately forgettable in the grand scheme of the otherwise impressive album.
Despite this sub-par track, the rest of the album successfully showcases the band’s ability to merge its musical talent with themes drawn from the members’ life stories. “Climbing a Chair to Bed” asks, Are you too afraid of living to make a man’s mistakes? It features pounding drums and is a classic  example of the signature Dropkick Murphys sound.
For bagpipe lovers, “Deeds Not Words” is an attention-grabbing song with a fist-pumping chorus.
The guys continue delivering hard-hitting tracks with “Sunday Hardcore Matinee,” a homage to the music scene of Massachusetts that tells a tale of camaraderie and celebrates the locale in which the band grew up.
Some of the record’s best melodies can be found in “1953,” which details how Larkin met his wife when he returned home from the Korean War. Touching lyrics include lines like When I was lost, you carried on / when I was weak, you kept us strong.
The record wraps up with two covers apropos to the album’s story. “Peg O’ My Heart” features the legendary Bruce Springsteen trading vocals with Casey as they offer a modern take on this classic Irish love song. They inject a furious amount of energy into this fun offering as they sing, Since I heard your lilting laughter / it’s your Irish heart I’m after.
Closing the record in an uproariously explosive fashion is a cover of the traditional Irish anthem “The Irish Rover.” The track effectively concludes the record by showing the potential danger that any immigrant would face in his or her journey and is easily one of the album’s best offerings.
The Dropkick Murphys has created an album completely worth the three-plus year wait since its last studio release, The Meanest of Times.
The band has always taken risks while preserving its identity, and this concept album is the highlight of its career so far.
Meanest of Times is still their best album.

Imagine Inception or The Social Network without a soundtrack.
Inception would be a slow-moving, boring film with too many Leonardo DiCaprio close-ups, and Jesse Eisenberg and Co.’s fast-paced whines would be much more audible, and thus annoying, in The Social Network. 
Both of those movies feature intense, prominent and well utilized scores, and both were successful films.
Ever since the invention of feature-length movies, music has played a prominent role in film.
Compelling scores kept people interested during the silent film era, and that trend ultimately carried over into talkies, despite the ability to utilize dialogue.
Scores and musical soundtracks have been, and almost always are, integral to the movie-watching experience, but they’re often overlooked.
There are many cinema fans who appreciate the sound in film and understand the effort that goes into creating and integrating a good soundtrack, but the common moviegoer likely doesn’t even notice the music.
That’s the goal of a score: to blend into the background while still achieving the necessary effect.
This might not be a revolutionary statement, but classical music makes everything significantly more dramatic.
Filmmakers know this, and use it to their advantage to heighten the intensity and drama in their films.
I recently experienced the power of classical music firsthand while at Bovard Auditorium, watching a classical orchestra rehearse.
As with every time I hear classical music, I zoned out and started thinking about other things, namely how much I can’t stand classical music.
Not to criticize the musicians, as they all were extremely talented, but I simply don’t have the attention span to listen to the genre on a regular basis.
After the orchestral rehearsal picked up in intensity, I had a sudden revelation: Classical music is boring, but it also makes everything riveting.
I would check my phone during the performance and read a typical text such as “Yeah” or “Will, you’re so cool!” just as the strings and timpani drums played a powerful hit.
The combination of loud orchestral classical music and human action (however petty that action was) made me feel like I was listening to something akin to Gandalf battling the Balrog.
Nerdy references aside, the point is still that classical music always add intensity.
After Inception’s release last summer, viral videos started appearing on the Internet with titles along the lines of “Inception Music Makes Everything Epic.”
The premise was simple, much like my experience watching the orchestra rehearse at Bovard.
Any ordinary event or action is greatly dramatized when a strong score is played in the background.
The series of videos included short clips of people doing everything from throwing a jar of peanut butter to each other to relieving themselves on the toilet, but they got the point across.
Music from Inception and other classical music scores really do make everything intense.
Classical music, however, is not the only style used by filmmakers for dramatic effect.
The Social Network and Tron: Legacy both included electronic music scores masterfully created by popular musicians Trent Reznor from Nine Inch Nails and Daft Punk, respectively.
The Social Network won the Academy Award for Best Film Score while Tron ended up being a terrible waste of money and effort, but both demonstrated films do not need orchestras for added theatrical effect. As long as there’s some sort of instrumental score, a film feels even more dramatic.
If the recent success of both The Social Network and Tron: Legacy soundtracks and the wide variety of Inception soundtrack-parodying viral videos prove anything, it’s that casual movie fans are beginning to better appreciate the use of scores in film, no matter the genre.

While Taco Bell is busy trying to convince the world that its beef products really do contain actual meat, those who are unwilling to trust fast-food corporations might want to branch out and visit the smaller food establishments around the USC campus.
Restaurante Rincon Nicaraguense, a tiny Nicaraguan restaurant squeezed into an obscure strip mall along Vermont Avenue only a quarter of a mile from campus, is just one of many hole-in-the-wall eateries in Los Angeles.
The restaurant, owned by a middle-aged couple, opened to little fanfare earlier this year, and remains a shy, quiet little establishment visited mostly by local residents.
Nothing is fancy or commercialized about Restaurante Rincon Nicaraguense. Except for a Nicaraguan flag and some odd trinkets, such as the Muñecas de Nicaragua (handmade Nicaraguan dolls), the small mom-and-pop store is modest and bare, very much like a canteen.
The “pop” of the shop is a gruff, bespectacled man who operates the kitchen. The “mom” is a short, friendly lady who is more than willing to explain Nicaraguan cuisine walk you through the menu.
That menu, though, is relatively simple and straightforward. Nicaraguan cuisine is a melting pot of cultures: native Central American influenced by techniques and ingredients brought over by Spanish colonists and African slaves.
One famous Nicaraguan dish is the baho, a steaming banana leaf packet stuffed with beef brisket, plantains and yucca. Because of the time it takes to prepare the dish, it is traditionally served on Sunday afternoons. Restaurante Rincon Nicaraguense only serves the dish on Saturdays and Sundays.
The meaty, starchy item, available for $10, has to be steamed low and slow over a large pot, and is really a community-style meal that tastes best when shared with a group. It is a Nicaraguan-style meat-and-potato treat well worth a weekend’s trip with a group of friends.
Otherwise, stick to the side dish staples. The carne asada meal ($10), or broiled steak, paled in comparison to the side dishes that came along with it. The meat smelled wonderful broiling on top of the grill, but turned out to be a tough, sinewy disappointment when served.
The gallo pinto, however, a fried rice dish with red beans, was flavorful and a joy to eat, every bite rich with garlic spices.
The slab of queso frito (fried cheese) that comes on top looks a lot like bland tofu, until you sink your teeth into its firm, crispy flesh and pull off a creamy, mellow-flavored chunk.
Even the condiments are more deserving than the main course. The ensalada de relleno, a cabbage and tomato salad, is roughly and unevenly chopped, but tangy and refreshing, a perfect complement when mixed with the smoky rice and beans.
The chilero, an onion salsa, is spicy and pungent, teasing more juices onto the tongue. It certainly made digesting the carne asada a bit less painful.
But the stars of the carne asada meal were the tajadas, elongated fried plantain chips that are typically sold in plastic bags on Nicaraguan public buses.
At Restaurante Rincon Nicaraguense, you can see the whole process of the chips being made. You can watch the owner thinly slice fresh, unripe plantains upon your order, hear the sizzle and sputter of hot oil as he tosses the pieces into the deep fryer and then salivate when he serves them to you hot, golden and crunchy.
Plantains are a major staple in Nicaragua, and they cook them well here.
The empanadas de maduro ($3), a mound of pureed plantain that has been stuffed with cheese and then fried, is another must-try. The traditional Nicaraguan snack is a plump, brown nugget with a crispy, caramelized exterior, but the insides offer a sweet and creamy shell from the plantains and oozes sharp and gooey cheese in the center.
Many of dishes at Restaurante Rincon Nicaraguense are fried and rich in starch. But the fact that you can see the owners prepare your dishes from scratch with fresh ingredients in the open kitchen is reassuring and heartening.
Restaurante Rincon Nicaraguense is not necessarily 100 percent tasty or healthy food, but it is certainly a place you want to root for and share with others. At the very least, you won’t find any mystery meat in your dishes, and that’s more than you can say about Taco Bell.
Rincon Nicaraguense is located on 2703 south Vermont Ave.
You forgot to mention the most important dishes in Nicaragua: The traditional Nacatamal and coffee.
Too bad this place wasn’t there back in 2000’s.

Owners are used to having the ball in their court. They’re the ones who usually control  player movement, but that trend is shifting.
Both fans and players are upset that players like Lebron James are beginning to assert their power by joining forces with other superstars during free agency.
Jovanna Tosello | Daily Trojan
Although increased player freedom leads to more unpredictability, fans and local economies are better off for it.
Last summer, when James left the Cleveland Cavaliers after seven years to join the Miami Heat with Dwayne Wade and Chris Bosh, he did more than just sign a contract. He was the final piece in creating a “super-team.”
Carmelo Anthony forced his way out of Denver by refusing to sign an extension with the team. He landed in New York, teaming up with superstar forward Amar’e Stoudemire, who sparked the resurgence of the Knicks this season.
Combine that with the already stacked Boston Celtics and there are three teams in the Eastern Conference with two or more of the league’s top players, not to mention the Chicago Bulls, led by MVP and SAT-extraordinaire Derrick Rose.
The Western Conference is similarly top-heavy with the San Antonio Spurs, Dallas Mavericks, Oklahoma City Thunder and the Los Angeles Lakers.
The prospect of returning to the golden age in the ‘80s, where each playoff series could pit superstars against each other, is a tremendous step forward for the league, players and fans alike.
Higher ratings and higher quality games should follow, both of which commissioner David Stern should wholeheartedly embrace.
It will infuse the local economies of those cities and encourage other teams to compete for NBA, and potentially financial, supremacy.
James, according to a Forbes report, added $100 million of value to the Cavaliers’ franchise when he was there. An article by the Cleveland Plain Dealer found that downtown Cleveland businesses were expected to lose $48 million with James skipping town.
Conversely, a Chicago Business Journal article claims that LeBron would have added $2.7 billion to the Chicago economy had he chosen the Bulls.
Clearly, the loss of a superstar doesn’t just mean an inferior on-court product.
It affects the local economy also, for better or for worse. Teams are making overt efforts to land these superstars, not only to become a perennial championship contender, but also to boost their revenue and profit. Capitalism in sports is alive and well.
The basketball product, however, is still the reason we watch the sport. A Lakers-Heat finals that would lead to matchups like Kobe against Wade, Pau Gasol against Bosh and the volatile Ron Artest trying to lock down LeBron, would be one of the most highly anticipated series in recent history.
Every possible conference finals series between the top seeds is similarly intriguing.
There is no clear favorite among the top teams, meaning every game and every series will lead to a dramatic finish.
The prevalence of these so-called “super teams” could increase in the coming years.  The impending free agent market in 2012 could feature Orlando center Dwight Howard, New Jersey point guard Deron Williams and New Orleans point guard Chris Paul.
Three of the top 15 players in the league would have the power to choose where they want to play. Teams are clearing salary cap space to sign multiple superstars to field their own super-team.
People say parity is dying in the new NBA. Small markets teams will complain this is unfair, and that they cannot compete with the more powerful local economies.
This is entirely untrue. A perfect example is the Oklahoma City Thunder, one of the top teams in the Western Conference. Oklahoma City is the definition of small market, yet it has managed to sign its superstar Kevin Durant to a long-term extension. It has surrounded Durant with quality players both via trade and the draft and are in line to compete for NBA championships this year and many years to come.
Granted, Oklahoma City is the exception to the rule, but the possibility to compete as a small-market team does exist.
LeBron’s decision to leave Cleveland showed players that they could assert themselves to play in their ideal setting: a winning team in a favorable market.
His decision also demonstrated the heavy impact a single superstar can have on local economic growth.
And although some cities gain and some lose based on a player’s geographic preference, the league and loyal fans are better off knowing that their players are, in fact, where they desire to be.
It’s the state of competition at its best.

Harvard Business School recently revamped its Masters of Business Administration program, adding new required courses in ethics and teamwork, the Wall Street Journal reported earlier this month.
With its new curriculum, Harvard is looking for future “leaders of competence and character, rather than just connections and credentials,” said Brian Kenny, chief marketing officer at Harvard Business School, to the Wall Street Journal.
Ethics education in business schools has been a hot topic since the late 1980s, and rightfully so.
In an article in the Harvard Business Review in 2005, Warren Bennis, a distinguished professor of Business Administration in the Marshall school, said the nation’s top business schools have embraced a model where “they call for little insight into complex social and human factors and minimal time in the field discovering the actual problems facing managers.”
The culture that prevails at elite business schools, like USC’s Marshall School of Business, is often one focused on connections and networking, not ethics and management.
Though that culture is beneficial for many graduates, it also puts a premium on networking and creates a sense of entitlement among students.
That culture also means that if schools offer classes in ethics, it doesn’t guarantee students will put down their business cards and focus on learning to conduct a business ethically.
Despite the efforts the nation’s most prestigious business schools have been making in promoting ethics education, there is still a long way to go.
Moving forward, the Marshall school, faculty and students alike, would be wise to take an increased interest in ethics by jumping on this bandwagon of business education reform.
USC Marshall could also impact how business schools,  which breed our nations future leaders, emphasize ethical decision-making in the years ahead.

The carpet wasn’t the only thing that was red at this year’s pre-Oscar procession, so were many of the dresses that were elegantly worn down it.
None was more vibrant, however, than Anne Hathaway as she made her way into Hollywood’s Kodak Theater wearing a strapless, classic red Valentino gown, with the legendary designer Valentino Garavani on her arm. Such an honor was only appropriate for the actress who was co-hosting the 83rd Academy Awards Sunday night.
At her side onstage was James Franco, who was also up for an award: Best Actor in a Leading Role for his performance in 127 Hours. Together, Hathaway, 28, and Franco, 32, were the youngest duo to host the show in its 83-year history.
The move from conventional to contemporary seemed to be a common theme at this year’s awards, further exemplified by the Facebook-inspired film’s eight nominations.
Of these nominations, The Social Network was awarded Best Adapted Screenplay, Best Original Score and Best Editing.  Interestingly enough, Aaron Sorkin, who wrote the film’s screenplay, revealed on the red carpet that he does not have a Facebook himself.
“I’m not evangelical about not joining Facebook,” Sorkin said.  “The problem is, I probably wouldn’t know how to get there.  I wouldn’t know the keys to push.”
The Social Network’s musical score, which featured electronic sounds instead of a customary orchestra, was also a rather modern choice for the Academy.
“I was very impressed we actually won this with a very nontraditional sounding score,” said Trent Reznor, who, along with Atticus Ross, wrote the music for the film.
Also an advocate for the less traditional at the awards, Toy Story 3 director Lee Unkrich said that the inclusion of his film in the Best Picture category this year is a step in the right direction for the Academy.
“I think the fact that two years running now we have had animated films that have made it and received Best Picture nominations shows that the walls between live action and animation are becoming a bit more permeable,” Unkrich said, after Toy Story 3 was named Best Animated Feature.
The language that made its way into the awards ceremony didn’t fail to fit the more youthful theme either, as Melissa Leo dropped the Oscars’ first ever F-bomb during her acceptance speech for Best Supporting Actress.
“Those words, I apologize to anyone that they offend,” Leo said in the interview room just after her speech.
One member of the press applauded her for taking her rough character from The Fighter onstage with her, but her portrayal of Alice Ward inspired more than just her choice of words Sunday night.
“The dress I’m wearing tonight, I’d like to think that Alice would have liked it, and that was part of the choosing for it,” Leo said of her lacy off-white gown by Marc Bouwer.
Christian Bale, who was named Best Supporting Actor for his role as the boxing son of Ward in The Fighter, didn’t seem to mind Leo’s expletive, though he said he missed it because he wasn’t in the room when she received her award.
“I missed the F-bomb,” Bale said.  “But, you know, I’ve laid down many of them myself before.  So I think I know what it was all about.”
Bale entered the interview room hardly knowing what he had said during his own acceptance speech.
“I’ve got a question for you guys, actually,” he said.  “You know, you get up there and you’re giving your speech, and I hope to God that I mentioned Mark and Melissa and Amy and Jack.  Did I mention them?”
The King’s Speech director Tom Hooper, however, was primarily concerned with thanking one person during his acceptance speech: his mom. After attending a reading of a play called The King’s Speech, she came to Hooper and said she had found his next movie idea.
“Not only did she find it, she also reminded me every two weeks for about three months that I really should read it, and thank God I did because when I read it I rang her up and said sorry it’s taken me so long — yes, it is my next movie,” Hooper said in the interview room.
Colin Firth showed his gratitude after winning Best Actor for his role as Bertie in The King’s Speech by letting everyone in on a little secret: he was itching to break out in a celebratory dance.  Still, he denied one member of the press’s request that he follow his impulses in the interview room.
“No.  I was struggling with the containment in that moment and I think I need some quality time alone,” Firth said.  “I don’t think this is the particular forum to display that. Anyone having seen Mamma Mia will know what I’m talking about.”
Natalie Portman, pregnant and glowing in a violet Rodarte gown, said that winning Best Actress for her role in Black Swan was almost surreal.
“It feels very, very dreamlike right now,” Portman said.  “I don’t really know where I am.
Despite the Academy’s inclination towards the “young and hip” Sunday night, one of the more mature-themed movies managed to take home top honors.  Awarded Best Picture, producers of The King’s Speech seemed to know where they were, but weren’t sure where to go next after a night of such elation.
“The buildup of this award is I think like none of the others, and obviously it’s the final award of the season, and there’s just something about it that left us absolutely speechless,” said Gareth Unwin, one of the film’s producers.  “To have won this award, I don’t think there’s anywhere else we can go.”

After losing founding members Josh (guitar) and Zac Farro (drums), the once five-piece alternative rock act Paramore has been writing songs as a three-piece outfit, and is prepared to record some tracks to be released in the summer.
Hayley Williams (vocals), Taylor York (guitar), and Jeremy Davis (bass) have not let the Farro brothers’ departures stop them from going full steam ahead with Paramore, but the first of their new songs to appear does differ greatly in style and tone from their past material.
Making appearances on Williams’ Tumblr, the band’s homepage and various Youtube videos from live performances, “In the Mourning” has almost a folk feel to it and features Williams singing soft, catchy melodies over a single acoustic guitar.
It is expected that the other songs the band will release this summer on their new EP will be in a similar vein in that they will be slower, acoustic songs as opposed to their signature alternative rock/pop-punk material.
Williams assures fans, however, that there will be heavier songs when the band comes out with a new full-length record later in the year, which will be the follow-up to 2009’s wildly successful Brand New Eyes.
After their current South American tour is completed, the band head to the studio to work with producer Rob Cavallo (known for collaboration with Green Day) on getting the new songs recorded and released as soon as possible.
The Faroo brothers are now part of a new band called Novel American which is also set to begin recording and releasing new material in the near future.

The Academy-Award nominated filmmaker will direct his wife, Arsinée Khanjian, in a production of Martin Crimp’s Cruel and Tender. The husband and wife team have previously collaborated on numerous films, but have never worked together on stage.
“This is a wonderful play which is incredibly timely because it’s about the disposing of a tyrant. We see this disposing not from external forces, his bloody and horrific conquests, but from within the family structure itself, from the perspective of his son, his wife, his slave lover, his confidante” said Egoyan.
Atom Egoyan’s previous stage works include Die Walkure at the Canadian Opera Company in 2006, as well as more recent productions in Ireland, London and New York.
Cruel and Tender is scheduled to run Jan. 21 to Feb. 18, 2012 at the Bluma Appel Theatre in Toronto.
I am truly excited for this production and look forward to a trip to Toronto in support of Egoyan. Thanks for the blog post!
