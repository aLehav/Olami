 
USC Votes and the Dornsife Center for the Political Future are making sure that USC students have all the resources they need to make their voices heard.
Homelessness, housing costs and inflation are the most contested issues on this year’s ballot according to a recent Public Policy Institute of California poll. California voters will have the opportunity to voice their opinions on races for the 52 house seats, senate and gubernatorial seats, as well as the L.A. mayoral race between USC alumni Rep. Karen Bass and former USC Board of Trustees chair Rick Caruso. 
“I feel like this midterm elections and the mayoral race is particularly enticing this year,” said Michelle Li, a junior majoring in political science. “I feel like maybe our professors should encourage us to go [vote] more in our classes, or even take the day off.”
Kamy Akhavan, the executive director of the Center for the Political Future, has taken the lead this election season by providing information and voting opportunities to USC students.
“If 18 to 29-year-olds voted in proportion to their numbers, they would change the outcome of pretty much every election. So we want young people to vote, no matter who they vote for, they just need to be part of the process,” Akhavan said. “Voting is the oxygen for our democratic systems, and without oxygen, the system dies.”
USC Votes ran multiple events to encourage voter turnout throughout the fall. The initiative held registration drives on Trousdale Parkway and in Alumni Park, and hosted two secure ballot drop boxes placed in USC Village and on the Health Sciences Campus.
But the largest events of this season’s voting push were the two mobile voting centers at USC Village and Health Sciences Campus. Provided in collaboration with the L.A. County Registrar’s office, these centers allowed students to register to vote and fill out their ballots all in one place, with trained staff on site to answer questions and translate ballot information. These measures were all aimed at increasing political participation and helping students become engaged voters. 
“In 2020, about 72% of all students on campus voted, and then of all the people who are registered to vote, 87% of them voted. That number was high enough to get us ranked in the top four of the top 30 universities,” Akhavan said. “Fourth is great, but we want to be first.”
Hannah Young, a senior majoring in business and a California voter, appreciated USC’s efforts to make voting accessible to students.
“I plan on dropping off my ballot tomorrow at the USC Village,” Young said. “It’s so helpful because I’m an American citizen, and it’s super important to me that we vote and we recognize that right, because not everyone in the world has it.”
Gabe Romero, a graduate student studying environmental studies, said he hopes the program would increase voting access for college students. 
“Students have a lot to worry about between school and internships or jobs,” Romero said. “I think the mobile voting locations are really imperative to make voting as easy as possible for us.”
The Center for the Political Future is co-hosting an election night watch party Nov. 8 at the Annenberg Media Center and a post-election conference Nov. 17. Both will feature guest speakers and panelists who will break down what the results mean for L.A. and the rest of the country.

USC students may find themselves eagerly awaiting many race results that could greatly reshape the United States’ political landscape on Election Day Tuesday. While viewers will not find out the full results immediately after the polls close, many may have the desire to watch returns occur in real time — accompanied by live, expert analysis. 
The Daily Trojan has compiled a list of ways to view the 2022 midterm election results live on campus:
The Election Day Watch Party in Wallis Annenberg Hall
From 5-9:30 p.m. in the lobby of Wallis Annenberg Hall, many organizations on campus including the Annenberg Media Center, Trojan Democrats, USC College Republicans and the USC Dornsife Center for the Political Future will be sponsoring a large election day watch party. Bob Shrum, director of the USC Center for the Political Future and Christina Bellantoni, the director of USC Annenberg’s Media Center, will host the event. According to its description on the USC event calendar, “several more VIP panelists will be on site for real- time election result analysis and impromptu conversations with attendees.” 
Attendees must register in advance and present a corresponding ID (student or driver’s license) at the door. Dinner will be provided.
Televisions on campus 
USC is fortunate to have many televisions readily available in buildings around campus, some of which are available for students to control. All residential dining halls have televisions which may broadcast the news at any given time, and the USC Village Dining Hall usually has at least one TV tuned to a news station.
In dorms, lounge areas may contain televisions which students can tune to news channels themselves. Or, if they prefer, TVs with HDMI ports allow students to plug in their computers with a particular livestream running. 
Campus classrooms
Another way to gather with friends or a club and watch the results come in is by taking over or reserving one of USC’s many classrooms. As all of USC’s “general assignment” (standard layout) classrooms come with basic audio/visual setups. All students need to do is hook up a computer and tune into the livestream of their choice. 
Ideally, requests should be made one week in advance and will take approximately two days to process, but if students still wish to try to reserve a classroom they should email classroom.scheduling@usc.edu or call (213) 740-4612. Requests should include the student’s department, event name, day they need the room, start and end times, number of seats needed, room type, any particular building preferences as well as personal information such as their name, extension, campus address and email address.

From a quiet office shaded by trees in the Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism, USC professor Fred Cook is one of the only people in the world putting numbers to the most pressing issues in American politics. 
Last March, Cook released “The Polarization Index,” a first-of-its-kind political report that quantitatively measures polarization on 10 major legislative issues in the United States. 
Cook created the report in collaboration with Golin, a PR firm and narrative intelligence company Zignal Labs. Spanning a variety of political issues, the report explains which political party is most engaged, how divided Democrats and Republicans are on a topic and the relative amount of unreliable information being circulated through social media. 
“We became really interested in polarization before [President Trump] left office,” Cook said. “I was interested to see if the level of activism on both sides would be reduced or increased after the change [in administration].”
To add a qualitative measure to “The Polarization Index,” Cook and his collaborators tracked Twitter engagement with pieces of media from 450 news outlets, which had previously been ranked by reliability. When a user retweeted a piece of media, the topic that it discussed was ranked as more or less polarized based on the reliability of the content. The more unreliable content that was shared on a topic, the more polarized the topic was considered.
“The Polarization Index” was originally created to help guide corporations through tense political times where more consumers expect their employers and producers to take a stand on social issues. However, the index also has the potential to reveal more nuances about the state of U.S. politics, especially ahead of the upcoming midterm elections.
The results of the first edition of the study revealed new revelations about what the political parties prioritized: Democrats and Republicans were found to be focused on completely separate issues. Republicans tended to devote significantly more time to discussing immigration and crime, while Democrats were more focused on abortion and the Jan. 6 investigation. There was little overlap between the two.
“Polarization isn’t a result of people disagreeing,” Cook said. “It is the cause of people disagreeing, and it’s becoming a strategy that politicians and media use to build their audience.”
In Cook’s opinion, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis’s recent decision to fly undocumented immigrants to Martha’s Vineyard was a perfect example of intentional actions taken to polarize the public by political officials. 
“He knows immigration is what’s gonna power his brand and excite his people,” Cook said. “So he creates this story … and immigration is back in the news because he put it there.” 
Cook believes such polarizing stunts work best with issues such as immigration, because it was “not the most talked about issue on our list, but the most polarizing because the difference of opinion is greater and the media sources that are talking about it are less reliable.”
USC students reacted to the study’s results with both apprehension and appreciation. 
“It’s scary to see how polarized these key issues are,” said John Belton, a sophomore studying public policy. “In a time when bipartisan solutions are needed, it’s clear that it is becoming harder and harder [to accomplish] as the nation becomes more divided. It’s impressive to see the work that went into the quantification of polarization, and I can hope that by being aware of this trend, I can help solve the problem.” 
Cat Cornish, a junior majoring in public relations and political science, thought that the best aspect of “The Polarization Index” was that it recognized an issue within the public relations industry that people are aware of but few know how to address. 
“I’d be super interested to see if they ever track [polarization] on Facebook, because I know the dialogue on Facebook is wildly different than it is on Twitter,” Cornish said.
Despite the discord, Professor Cook believes that there is a way out of polarization in the next few years. 
“We need to work together,” Cook said. “USC students have to be aware that they’re being manipulated by people who are in the media and in politics.”

Proposition SP, an 8.4 cent per square foot parcel tax imposed on residential and commercial businesses to raise money for park improvements across the city. (Image Courtesy of Channone)
As voters head to the polls Tuesday, three city propositions on the ballot in Los Angeles could prove crucial to the city’s effort to reduce homelessness and fund improvements for parks and other public spaces.
Perhaps the most impactful of the three is Measure ULA, the so-called “mansion tax,” which would impose a tax on real estate sales above $5 million, with the funds going to various homelessness and tenant protection programs. The measure, backed by a large group of unions and progressive groups, could raise more than $600 million every year. 
Supporters of the measure cite the need for additional affordable housing money as current funds are expected to dwindle over the next few years. United to House LA, the proposal’s main backer, argues the initiative would “reduce homelessness, make housing more affordable and protect low-income seniors.” Opponents argue that the tax could affect a lot more than just the “mansions” its nickname suggests. In fact, around 75% of the tax would be levied on multifamily and commercial properties. 
Also on the ballot is Proposition SP, an 8.4 cent per square foot parcel tax imposed on residential and commercial businesses to raise money for park improvements across the city. The tax would exempt low-income households and be prioritized by the L.A. Equity Index, directing funds to neighborhoods most in need of park improvements. Unlike ULA, which only requires a simple majority, Proposition SP needs a two-thirds majority to succeed. 
Zaid Diaz-Arias, a junior majoring in public policy and an L.A. City Youth Council Member for District 2, is originally from North Hollywood. Having seen the vast differences in park quality across different neighborhoods in the San Fernando Valley, he supports Proposition SP. 
“When I see and compare the differences between, for instance, parks in North Hollywood and parks in Sun Valley … and compare those to ones in Granada Hills or Porter Ranch, it’s very different,” Diaz-Arias said. “And they’re both in Los Angeles.”
Rounding out the trio is Proposition LH, which would authorize the city to build or acquire an additional 75,000 income-restricted affordable housing units. The proposition does not guarantee the development of nor provide the funding for the additional units; it simply raises the limit for affordable housing units that the city can manage without voter approval. 
Most local groups have supported LH, citing the need for more affordable housing to keep up with increased demand. The official Los Angeles ballot measures pamphlet received no endorsements against LH. 
Hoangnha Vo, a first-year graduate student studying applied data science, expressed support for Proposition ULA, and tentatively supported Propositions LH and SP.
“It’d be good unless it raises costs [of living] as a result,” Vo said. 
Rianna Rios, a senior majoring in public policy, said she supports all three measures, but has concerns about the implementation of Propositions ULA and LH. 
“I want to make sure that people look at the details of implementation,” Rios said. “We have many districts and many districts enforce different forms of implementation … We can pass it, but we have to make sure the enforcement is not vague because every district has different constituents and different stakeholders.”

Now, I’m not very good at this stuff. As opinion editor, I can ramble on about social justice, mental health and law all you want — but if you ask me what my favorite song or artist is, I’d probably tell you I don’t know, lie or give you a different answer each time you ask. This is reflected in my playlists. These days, I feel like it’s common to have a Spotify account with at least 20 different playlists. Currently, I’m working on playlist 64 which I named “noisy november” because this past week alone my head has been filled with more chaos and commotion than usual. 
To give you a peek into my mind and what my November has been like, the first few songs of “noisy november” are “Pool” by Still Woozy and Remi Wolf, “Rich Spirit” by Kendrick Lamar and “TOMBOY” by (G)I-DLE. You could say I have a diverse music taste but the real reasons for my chaotic arrangements of songs in my playlist is 1: I am too indecisive to settle on one genre or artist and 2: I use music to formulate my emotions because my emotions are usually more tumultuous than my playlists are. 
I often get this feeling of overwhelming claustrophobia, pressure on my temples and ringing in my ears where it feels like everyone is yelling different things around me. My thoughts become a puzzle with missing pieces and I lose focus on what I’m doing as my brain goes numb. So what do I do instead of writing that essay due the next day? I make a playlist. 
I have no idea what I’m feeling or how I’m doing 90 percent of the time — it’s probably due to some combination of anxiety, depression and PTSD, but who knows. The only thing that seems to get me out of that haze of emotions is either sticking my face in ice water or music. I think Kendrick said it best in “Rich Spirit”:
“The morality can wait, feedback on low latency, I’m glitching from the face as my thoughts grow sacredly, I’m runnin’ out of space.”
Most of the time I’m on high latency but as the music blasts through my headphones, the fog in my brain starts to clear and suddenly my brain is working on low latency. Now, as a neuroscience major, I know that music isn’t magically cleaning up my brain with a biological mop of some kind. I know that music is acting as a stimulus in my brain, activating multiple regions between both hemispheres. Through a cascade of reactions and firing neurons, music helps my brain process the immense flow of information coming in and starts organizing it just like I organize my emotions with my playlists.
Now, as a person who has 64 playlists ‘cause she doesn’t have the capacity to sort her emotions out on her own, I think it’s because songwriters don’t just compose music but emotions into the heart of their songs.
When my heart is so broken that I can’t cry and I am lost in a field of confusion as to why a loving and healthy relationship didn’t work out, I’m reminded by Delaney Bailey that no matter how much love was there, at my core I’m a hopeless romantic looking for someone to “tie a lasso around the moon and bring it on down” even if I didn’t ask because I would “give [them] the sun if [they] asked me.”
When I continuously make excuses for the things my mom puts me through and I don’t know why my eyes start tearing up, Harry Styles and “Matilda” remind me that I’m crying because I normalized my family’s behavior.
 “Nothing ‘bout the way that you were treated ever seemed especially alarming ‘til now.”
When the guilt of distancing myself from my family eats me alive, I just remind myself that it’s okay to “throw a party full of everyone you know and not invite your family, ‘cause they never showed you love.” Then I question my relationship with my family and I queue Conan Gray’s “Family Line” to get the answer to the hole I’m feeling in my chest.
“It’s hard to put it into words how the holidays will always hurt, I watch the fathers with their little girls and wonder what I did to deserve this? How could you hurt a little kid? I can’t forget, I can’t forgive you ‘cause now I’m scared that everyone I love will leave me.”
Sheesh. Am I right? Who needs a therapist when you can get the answers to your internal conflicts on Spotify for only $4.99 a month — and it comes with free subscriptions to Hulu and SHOWTIME? (This article is not sponsored by Spotify and please go see a therapist).
Music doesn’t always give me the answers I’m looking for, but it’s a place where I can sit amongst all the things I’m feeling freely. I’m pretty sure I don’t interpret the songs the way the artist had in mind, but that’s the beauty of it and depending on the day, “laurel” by BETWEEN FRIENDS reminds me that I deserve better:
“I always wait for you to call me, but you’re never on time. And every night I’m on your old street, you’re the one on my mind. But do they care?”
And other nights, I’m reminded that relationships and breakups are a two-way street:
“I should let you go because I’m always on my own. I’ve been waiting for you to call me, running back to tell you I’m sorry, yeah I should let you go.”
Heartbreak, excitement, anger, love, depression, anxiety — I have a playlist for it all. Hell, I even have a playlist called brain juice. Things just make sense when I listen to music. This doesn’t just apply to songs with lyrics as I float away from my problems listening to Luke Faulkner’s piano composition “Clouds” and “Ballerina” by Yehezkel Raz.
While I still haven’t found all the missing pieces to the puzzle of my brain, music is a temporary placeholder that helps me go on with my day just like my antidepressants do.
Growing up, threats of my parent’s divorce echoed through the hallways and yelling scattered throughout my house when a tiny mistake was made. It was a place where the safest choice was to bottle up my emotions. The only way I learned how to tune out the noise and learn how to open up was through Taylor Swift’s “Fearless” album and Ed Sheeran’s “Photograph.” I learned how to grieve my dad with songs like “Talking to the Moon” by Bruno Mars and “Ripples” by beabadoobee.
At the end of the day, music is whatever I want it to be. While I can’t always control my emotions, I can always arrange my music to my liking. Some days it’s fun and my “dance till the cops come” actually brings the cops to the party. Other days it’s a bit more mellow, and I put on my “okie dokie” playlist.” And whatever is causing chaos in my life, it all settles once I put my headphones on.
“Jam Journal” is a rotating column featuring a new Daily Trojan editor in each installment commenting on the music most important to them.

Drake is hip-hop’s copycat. And he’s pretty damn good at it. 
This time around, the rapper molds into his co-host, Atlanta rapper (well, London rapper, but that’s another story) 21 Savage. The 16-song, hour-long project entitled “Her Loss” is as dazzling sonically as it is puzzling lyrically. 
Drake and 21 Savage probably got together after the success of “Honestly, Nevermind” closer, “Jimmy Cooks,” and said “f**k it, let’s make a full album of it.” And, to be honest, I was expecting a project full of songs that sound the same. But I have to say, the two managed to put together a product that is an entertaining listen that doesn’t lose momentum throughout. 
Far away from the boredom and repetition of “Certified Lover Boy” or the unpredictable highs and lows of “Honestly, Nevermind,” this project is Drake’s most consistent since 2018’s “Scorpion.” 
Make no mistake, this is a Drake album first and foremost. The Toronto rapper has four solo songs to 21 Savage’s one. Regardless, the two have an equal share of highlights on the record. “Major Distribution” features energetic flows from both, “Hours In Silence” slows things down and has Drake’s best vocal performance and 21’s solo track “3AM on Glenwood” is smooth and vulnerable. 
Even with two rap superstars, the real MVP of this project is the production. Noah “40” Shebib, OZ, Tay Keith, Metro Boomin and plenty other high-profile names put together some mesmerizing, soulful, sample-heavy beats that compliment Drake and 21 well. 
Two other stars deserve a mention for their noteworthy performances on the project: Travis Scott, the only real feature of the album, steals the show on “Pussy & Millions” and Lil Yachty peppers a few songs with fun ad-libs and has multiple production credits, to my surprise. 
Despite the sonic successes, there are just too many lyrical mishaps to ignore. Some bars are questionably phrased, laughable in content or strangely salty personal attacks towards celebrities.
Naming the album “Her Loss” sets a general expectation for the lyrical content of the project. It’s not a breakup album, but rather a trash-every-woman-I’ve-ever-met-in-my-life album. I could see how it’s part of the appeal in some respects, but it goes too far in multiple spots. 
While it’s not the most direct dig, it’s not a stretch to say Drake is calling out Megan Thee Stallion when he raps “this b***h lie ‘bout getting shots, but she still a stallion.” There is definitely a gray area (Lil Yachty claimed it was merely a line about women lying about injections), but especially considering this is Drake, I don’t believe this bar was coincidental. If not, it’s a lame, uncalled for attempt to discredit a woman who is the victim of an alleged shooting. 
Next thing you know, Drake takes shots at Serena Williams’ husband, saying “Sidebar, Serena, your husband a groupie.” Out of left field. And of course, instead of taking the issue up directly with her husband, he has to direct the shot at the woman. It’s lyrics like this that distract from really solid performances, with this line on “Middle of the Ocean” a prime example. 
It almost seemed as if Drake wanted to make it up to women when he delivered probably one of the most disingenuous bars of 2022 on “Spin Bout U”: “Damn, just turned on the news and seen that men who never got pussy in school are makin’ laws about what women can do.” The sentiment is right, but putting that lyric in an album full of bars that degrade women isn’t going to make everything better. 
The other central lyrical motif isn’t a surprise to anyone who has ever listened to 21 Savage: violence. This project is loaded with enough bars about murder to scare Playboi Carti. 
Don’t get me wrong, I find 21’s bars about gang violence, however reductionist and murderous (ex: “How was they your opps and none of ’em died?”), hard-hitting — especially knowing that he has absolutely lived through it. Drake, on the other hand, doesn’t quite have that same reputation. When he raps about getting an opp killed, for example, it’s hard not to chuckle a little thinking of the Drake soft-boy memes that have been flying around the internet.
21 Savage has his fair share of weird lyrics as well, including but not limited to: “I like fried rice, you better cook like you an Asian.” “How you come over to the spot when you know it’s your time of the month?” “She pretty, she show off her toes.” Hearing those for the first time left me confused to say the least. 
Admittedly, there were a few hidden gems throughout the project. Lines such as “Harry Styles numbers, it’s a robbery, my n****s go in-Zayn to catch a body” are equal parts hilarious and creative. 
I recognize that sometimes, it’s not about what’s said in a song but rather how it sounds. If that’s how you roll, then by all means give this project a spin. That being said, if lyrics that irk you hamper your enjoyment of an album as a whole — well, I think I’ve given you a fair warning.

I remember the first time I received a “C” on my report card in the third grade. I was convinced this “bad grade” would turn the 2012 end-of-the-world conspiracy into a reality. I was crushed — I’d never gotten anything below a “B” and I couldn’t understand what this meant for me. I had always been labeled the smart kid in class, who knew all the answers and never had to struggle to pass a quiz. The bookworm. The teacher’s pet. The pick-me. 
That big, bold “C” haunted me for weeks. If I’m being honest, it still does. I remember stuffing my report card into the bottom of my bag like it was trash. I didn’t want to see it or believe it. I pictured my parents’ disappointed faces and could practically hear the lecture I imagined would come. 
I have been what you call an “overachiever” for as long as I can remember. In high school, I prided myself on studying while getting the least amount of sleep possible the night before an exam. I was driven by A’s and held back by B’s. I was determined to be at the top of my class and attend the best university. I couldn’t do that by being mediocre. 
Everyone around me was doing better academically, online and offline. Seeing how effortless school was for my peers terrified me and instilled within me a toxic sense of competition. I needed to catch up with my classmates and those on social media. It was a poisonous race where I was always waiting for a moment to catch my breath. I put all my eggs in one basket and based all my self-worth on the grades I saw on the page. The pressure that I put on myself to be the best was debilitating, to say the least. And now, as a college student, I struggle to navigate my academics without drowning in the desire to overachieve. 
I’m not the only one who struggles with this academic pressure. According to the American Institute of Stress, eight out of ten college students experience frequent episodes of stress. I convinced myself that stress was just part of the process. I even told myself that I thrived under pressure when, in reality, I was tearing at the seams. I was under the impression that being an overachiever was the only way to accomplish my goals and succeed in the future.
Spoiler alert: I was sorely mistaken. In fact, I’ve come to realize that overachieving is not only detrimental but counterproductive. 
If you’re a fellow overachiever, I know what you’re thinking: “Gabby, what’s wrong with striving to be perfect? I want to deliver quality work!’’
First, I’m sorry to tell you, but perfection is an illusion. It doesn’t exist. Second, the desire to have an A on a midterm or deliver a flawless rendition of “I Will Always Love You” to your family members isn’t wrong. But if you find that you beat yourself up over a B instead of an A, or you lash out when your voice cracks in the second verse, that could be a small part of a more significant issue. Psychology Today discusses the dangers of perfectionism, stating that striving to be perfect can lead to depression and anxiety.
Not only this, but overachieving isn’t as productive as you might think. It can actually lead to a massive amount of procrastination as every task holds equal importance, which makes it challenging to prioritize. Tasks are muddled and it can become increasingly difficult to begin tasks out of fear, failure or inadequacy.
To my fellow overachievers, I know it can be tough to break the cycle. However, overachieving isn’t ingrained — it is learned. And, like all things, everything can be unlearned if you’re willing to do the work. So, instead of doing the work to be perfect, do the work to give yourself a break and allow yourself to be imperfect.
Long-term success and satisfaction do not rely on the status of your GPA or the amount of A’s on your transcript. It comes from your definition of happiness and success, those you treasure in life and your values. Be a little kinder to yourself and cut yourself some slack.

Every Saturday, I actively commit the biggest sin known to Trojans: I root for a football team that isn’t called the USC Trojans. Where might my loyalties lie, you ask, if not with Lincoln Riley and what feels like a brand-new Trojan football team? It lies in between the hedges with the Georgia Bulldogs, of course. 
Whether it was Thanksgivings spent in Athens or just a random Saturday down in the South, the Bulldogs were like a barometer for how everything else in my life would go down. If the Bulldogs won, that meant good weather and better vibes. If the Bulldogs lost, my grades would dip, my parents would move one step closer to a divorce and I’d get physically sick. When I was watching the 2021 National Championship game between Georgia and Alabama, my stomach did flips and spin cycles. When the Bulldogs eventually rolled the tide out of Nick Saban and his Alabama team, I suddenly felt like I was the pinnacle of health.
I have to make it clear that not everyone that watches college football is as far-gone as I am, but you have got to understand that this sport does take on a whole different meaning and intensity in the South. As questionable as they may be, former college football legends turned politicians have quite a big microphone in those parts.
Outsiders looking into Georgia’s senate race might be confused as to why Herschel Walker, a man with various serious allegations against his character, is still getting votes despite the outrageous things he says on stage. Outsiders that peered into former Auburn head coach Tommy Tuberville’s successful campaign for an open Alabama senate seat might’ve wondered the same thing: how can a guy who can barely name all three branches of government ever get votes?
Think of it this way, if your favorite artist suddenly ran for office, and you believe their values align with yours — except they can’t remember how many Justices are on the Supreme Court, wouldn’t you look past that last, small discrepancy? They’re an artist, after all — an outsider even! They’re gonna bring in new ideas and new ways to get things done. Does it really impact you if they don’t remember everything about government? That’s pretty similar to how Tuberville, and now Walker voters, think of their chosen candidate. 
It all makes just a bit more sense when you factor in the idea that football, especially the college variant, has turned into a political proxy. That’s more or less thanks to its roots and history dating back to the Civil War. There’s a fascinating article from (of all places) The Bleacher Report that provides an expansive explanation for why college football has become the pride and joy of the South. But, what you really ought to remember from it is this quote by Tony Barnhart, who summarised the mindset of the South a few decades removed from the Civil War as being: “We may not be able to beat the North in the war or economically, but by God we can beat them on the football field.” 
Watching college football is an emotional ordeal, as you probably already know from my confessions earlier in this article. It lends all the more power to candidates, like Walker, running on the power of memory. I will forever remember what it felt like to see the Georgia Bulldogs win just a short year ago. I never, ever thought I would see that happen in my lifetime. 
For years, the Bulldogs were always the bridesmaid and never the bride; they always came close but never first. We were always the underdogs, counted out. When we won, I felt like it proved something. I felt like because Georgia triumphed, I did too. In many ways, I’m sure a lot of Walker voters are voting for a guy who will hopefully make them feel the same way about America, as Walker made them feel about the Georgia Bulldogs.
I’m not totally sure if parasocial is the right word to describe this kind of connection and potent power of memory that seems to grip a lot of Southern fans of college football. Regardless of word choices, just don’t knock the power of that kind of memory. It doesn’t hurt to invoke a sense of pride for a certain campaign or candidate from voters. Perhaps, unfortunately, for non-athlete political candidates, especially in areas where college football is held in near-religious regard, sometimes sports stardom and those “good old memories” beat out real policy and platforms.

For much of Monday night’s men’s basketball game, the loudest sounds in the arena weren’t from DJ Mal-Ski. They came from the opposing bench. 
Florida Gulf Coast cheers and excessive towel-waving on the bench dominated the noise as USC dropped its season opener 74-61 at Galen Center. The Trojans showed some life by cutting the Eagles’ lead to nine with a minute left, but it was too little too late. 
“We just didn’t have it tonight,” said Head Coach Andy Enfield in a post-game press conference Monday. “They’re good players. We’ll get better. We have really good players on our team and they just had an off night as a collective group.”
Senior guard Boogie Ellis led USC with 19 points. Redshirt senior guard Drew Peterson added 7 points and 9 rebounds. Redshirt junior forward Joshua Morgan had 6 points, 9 rebounds and 7 blocks. 
Enfield debuted a revamped starting lineup with four guards and one center, relying on guards a majority of the night. For the first time since the 2018-19 season, a Mobley brother was unavailable to play. The Trojans were going to play fast and shoot often from deep. 
Instead, they turned the ball over 15 times, shot just under 16% from the 3-point line and were outrebounded 46-35.
“When you play four guards a lot, some of the guards are not used to going to the glass as much as they should,” Enfield said. “We’ve actually been rebounding the ball pretty well in our two scrimmages.”
Ellis acknowledged that it’s a tough transition as a guard to pay more attention to crashing the glass for rebounds. He pointed to some plays where rebounds were fought over by teammates, something Ellis believes can be fixed by communicating better. 
“We got to do all the little things,” he said. “Make sure we’re boxing out, working together, communicating on defense … we just got to communicate and I feel like we just got to come together and know that this year we got to hold our hats on something different.”
Up by just one at halftime, USC collapsed in the final twenty minutes of the game. 
The matchup was haunted by inefficiency on offense and a defense that allowed the Eagles to shoot 37.5% from three. The Trojans went without a field goal for nearly seven minutes in the second half, putting together more bricks than swishes. 
In need of a second-half comeback, the Trojans’ offense simply never left the locker room. 
Through the first 10 minutes, USC shot 30% from the field with more turnovers (6) than field goals made (4). The Trojans were outscored 17 to 5 across seven minutes in the second half as turnovers piled on and missed shots became a commonality. 
Isolation basketball became USC’s go-to as the game slipped away.
“It looked like [the players] went back to some bad habits or did not play like they had been, so it was disappointing,” Enfield said. “We don’t have the luxury of having a dominant big guy scorer like we’ve had in the past.”
Meanwhile, Florida Gulf Coast extended its lead to as much as 15 with 9:20 left in the game and never looked back. 
The Trojans relied on their defense early, holding Florida Gulf Coast without a basket for the first four minutes of the game. The Eagles even went scoreless between 13:06 and 9:36 in the first half as USC extended its lead. 
But, nine turnovers in the first half hindered its rhythm offensively. The Trojans shot just 1-for-12 from three. Multiple scoring droughts left Enfield screaming on the sidelines. 
“We had some turnovers that really hurt us because we went into a couple of droughts tonight offensively and we had some transition opportunities, some opportunities where we drove the lane and we didn’t convert,” Enfield said. 
USC’s lack of size hurt them early. It struggled on the glass, giving up eight offensive rebounds in the first half leading to six Eagle points in the paint. Florida Gulf Coast also outscored the Trojans 18 to 12 in the paint. 
“We’re going to take a lot from this game and better believe we’ll be ready Thursday,” Peterson said.
USC plays Alabama State next on Thursday at Galen Center.

The last time a PAC-12 program was among the 4 teams in the college football playoffs was Washington who lost against Alabama in 2016. Since then, the idea of a PAC-12 team making the playoffs was almost laughable — until this season. 
The PAC 12 now has 3 legitimate playoff contenders, with USC having the clearest path to success. 
Heading into this weekend, USC needed a lot of help, but now the opportunity is within reach for Lincoln Riley and the Trojans if they win out. 
Clemson’s loss to Notre Dame not only knocked the Tigers out of contention, but it boosted the resume of a struggling Notre Dame team before USC’s matchup against The Fighting Irish on November 26th.  
Further, Alabama, a team which was already on thin ice after losing to Tennessee in historic fashion, was defeated by LSU in a late- night thriller.
A two loss team has never made the college football playoffs, Alabama (7-2) won’t be the exception this season. 
When the Alabama-LSU game ended in the second quarter of the USC game, some fans in the coliseum started cheering, recognizing the Trojan’s elevated playoff status resulting from Alabama’s loss. 
The Trojans can safely look past this week’s game against a 1-7 Colorado team to their imminent showdown in the Rose Bowl against UCLA. Oregon will play Utah that week, in a double-header weekend which could feature two play-in games for the Pac-12 championship. 
If USC can survive November 19th’s test against the Bruins and win out, they will have an extremely convincing track record. Out of any outcome, USC as an 11-1 conference champion is the best shot at a PAC-12 playoff bid. Oregon and UCLA can justifiably hold playoff aspirations, but it will be difficult for either team to escape the stain of Oregon’s 49-3 loss to Georgia. 
The selection committee will balk at the idea of a Georgia-Oregon rematch given the first result. It will be difficult for Oregon to get in higher than a 4 seed to escape this reasoning, and Georgia is a huge favorite to be the 1 seed. UCLA is not directly connected to this loss, but they are indirectly by way of their loss to Oregon. 
USC is only stained by a one-point loss to Utah on the road, a fact the committee might be compelled to ignore given the Trojans’ strength of schedule and brand recognition.
There is definitely a bias towards larger programs, and a Trojan team led by Lincoln Riley and Caleb Williams fighting for a national championship game that is going to be played at SoFi stadium is very marketable.
Still, returning to earth, there is a long road ahead. The Trojans must win their next 4 games, of which, 3 will be against ranked opponents unless Notre Dame loses another game. 
Then, cards must fall in the Trojans’ favor, clearing enough teams to make room for what would be an 11-1 Pac-12 championship team.Barring anything outrageous, Georgia, along with the winner of Ohio State-Michigan (assuming they win the conference) has a playoff spot secured. Among the teams vying for the final 2 spots, TCU currently has the best odds with an undefeated record in the Big 12. The losers of Michigan-Ohio State, along with Mississippi and Tennessee in the SEC, are also still at large. 
Other notable outcomes include Mississippi or LSU beating Georgia in the SEC championship, which would likely result in two SEC teams in the CFP.
USC fans should root for Georgia to win out, for Oregon to win out until they (hopefully) face the Trojans in the Pac-12 championship, and for TCU To lose. 
This is a brief summation of a few out of hundreds of possible outcomes, and largely rests upon a shaky assumption that top teams beat all of their unranked opponents.
Expect massive changes in the CFP rankings over the next few weeks which could land USC in the playoffs, out of playoff contention, or in another major bowl game. 
Taking a step back from the hypotheticals, USC was a 4-8 team last year that Lincoln Riley transformed into a playoff contender in one summer. It’s time to focus on winning Pac-12 championships again, and the playoff talk can come after. 
In any event, this is a season Trojan fans will remember for a long time, and certainly has the potential to begin to restore this historic program back to its former glory.
