Keck Medicine of USC has taken a big step to improve disparate treatment in medicine by hiring its first ever chief officer of diversity and inclusion. Shannon Bradley, who began serving in the position on Sept. 26, aims to bring more equity and diversity to the health center, addressing issues of inclusion among both patients and employees. 
Bradley predicts her work will center around a few specific areas: the first being the facilitation of an ongoing process of learning and education by implementing trainings on vocabulary, addressing biases and ways to communicate productively about the experiences of others. Bradley also plans to encourage more interaction with members of the communities Keck serves. 
Another area of focus is inclusion, which Bradley said she believes Keck employees must constantly practice. She hopes to foster a more inclusive environment through a combination of education and resource and tool identification. Overall, her goal is to make Keck more inclusive for employees, patients and partners. 
“[Inclusion] is like a muscle. And so, the more you practice, or strengthen inclusion and your inclusion practices, the more you build that muscle memory,” Bradley said. 
The last area she plans to focus on is equity, which Bradley said she believes must be present in every aspect of life. For Bradley, improving equity will involve evaluating current procedures and analysis of data to form goals, as well as having a strong sense of responsibility in terms of actually getting these goals accomplished. 
“Equity will continue to be a theme across the board that we incorporate into everything we do. It’s a process and an outcome,” she said. 
Keck Medicine has been taking other steps in this area, including implementing the Diversity and Inclusion Steering Committee in June 2020, a collection of six employee resource groups which support members of traditionally disenfranchised groups and release educational toolkits to the community. Keck has also been working to develop a health equity dashboard with the purpose of examining demographics in the workplace, and how this can be expanded to be more inclusive. They also implemented bias training, with 94% of the leadership team, including medical directors, completing the training last year. 
Bradley will also work with Keck’s Diversity and Inclusion Committee to expand on past accomplishments by using the information they previously gathered to establish new goals and help plan initiatives. 
“What we ultimately created was a forum and a vehicle to be able to address ongoing opportunities [and] shape programming,” Smitha Ravipudi, chair of the committee, said. 
People outside of Keck Medicine will be involved as well. Christopher Manning, the University’s chief inclusion and diversity officer will also be working closely with Bradley and the steering committee to unify efforts between the health center and the rest of the University. With over twenty schools, multiple factions of USC are involved in similar yet isolated efforts to achieve their equity goals. 
Some accomplishments that Manning considers to be high points include the Minority Serving Institution Recruitment Conference, which will happen for the second time this year and works with minority serving institutions to allow their students to interact with USC’s graduate programs. The conference is an early acceptance pathway program that has been developed in conjunction with Xavier University, and the focus is on recruiting and enrolling a group of socioeconomically, racially and ethnically diverse students. 
“I’m seeking to foster a singular vision of equity, inclusion and belonging at USC,” Manning said. 
He said he wants efforts to apply in the classroom context, clinical context and all other areas so that people involved with different parts of the University can all understand each other and learn together, as well as expect the same level of respect in different parts of the University system. 
Bradley said she looks forward to her time in the role and believes that this new position is a critical way to provide exceptional care. 
“We have a reputation for excellence, and the focus and the goal was really to continue to provide exceptional care and outcomes,” she said. 
Bradley believes that such jobs are incredibly important in healthcare, as they can determine the comfort level, safety and health outcomes of a number of people. With this new focus, Keck Medicine hopes to provide a better experience for those working there as well as those receiving care, while setting a positive example for other institutions. This is the next step in a long journey, Ravipudi said. 
“We are very dedicated to ensuring that this work is not a committee. It’s not a goal. It goes well beyond that to the point where it’s actually woven into our fabric and ultimately is hardwired into who we are,” she said.

In Oct. 2020, Rick Caruso, then chair of USC’s governing board, underwent a nine-hour secret testimony regarding who was to blame for the sexual abuse and harassment inflicted on students by campus gynecologist George Tyndall.  A slew of attorneys representing 710 USC students and alumni grilled Caruso in the remotely held deposition.
Tyndall worked at the clinic for 27 years, serving as the only full-time gynecologist at USC. Allegations initially surfaced in 2016 following a report by a chaperone nurse of inappropriate conduct with a student patient, inspiring hundreds more victims to come out and starting an investigation into his career.  
The Los Angeles Times released Caruso’s answers from the testimony Tuesday. A protective order in the case kept the testimony from public view until this point. The secrecy surrounding the testimony raises questions as L.A. mayoral candidate Caruso has prided his campaign on his success in steering USC out of a scandal. 
According to the Times, the testimony’s transcript revealed that Caruso failed to answer many of the lawyers’ pressing questions. Over half a dozen USC legal team attorneys advised Caruso throughout the testimony. Caruso turned to attorney-client privilege repeatedly when declining to disclose information on administrative discussions regarding Tyndall or the conclusions of the investigation of Tyndall’s three-decade-long abusive history at USC.
Following the Times investigation, USC’s then-president C.L. Max Nikias and the general counsel alerted the board’s executive committee, including Caruso, of Tyndall’s actions over the phone. Lawyers in Caruso’s testimony drew attention to this phone call and the discussions to follow, yet Caruso once again referred to attorney-client privilege as the reasoning behind his failure to comment.
According to the Times, Lawyers from the O’Melveny & Myers law firm engaged in some of the most controversial lines of questioning in the entire testimony. Though Caruso promised reporters in 2018 and 2019 to release these questions to the public, he has yet to do so. 
Mayoral candidate Karen Bass has used this false promise as a point of attack against Caruso in her campaign, questioning in a radio debate this month “What about the victims? If that’s what they wanted, they should have had it.” 
Lead attorney in the deposition John Manly went on to question Caruso’s transparency. Despite having issued a public apology to Tyndall’s victims and helping oust Nikias as president, Caruso did not answer questions about assigning fault to USC. Similarly, Caruso did not blame supervisors or administrators.

Wednesday afternoon saw a new addition to McCarthy Quad: the Sexploration Tent. The tent, an event part of this year’s inaugural Sex Week, hoped to provide an inclusive, interactive and sex-positive hangout spot for USC students, featuring sex educators who answered anonymous questions pertaining to intimacy and sex. 
From vibrators to other sex toys, USC Student Health supported several student organizations — including the Graduate Student Government, Undergraduate Student Government, Student Assembly for Gender Empowerment and Women and Youth Supporting Each Other — to curate a welcoming environment for USC students to ask their most intimate questions. With trivia about human anatomy and a giveaway stand named “What’s Your Pleasure?,” the tent aimed to break the stigma of exploring one’s ever-evolving sexuality.
Certified sex educator and intimacy coordinator Erin Tillman, along with certified sex expert and USC’s LGBTQ+ campus advocate Edwin Bodney, were featured guests to answer Trojans’ questions. Tillman also gave away copies of her book, “The Consent Guidebook,” to educate USC students on a practical approach to consensual, respectful and enthusiastic sexual interactions. 
Tillman spoke about her mission as a sex educator and the importance of reducing the stigma surrounding embracing one’s sexuality. 
“Sexuality is one of the biggest things in our lives,” Tillman said. “It connects us together with each other as humans. It formulates how we move in the world, how we feel safe or not, so it’s really a very deep, profound thing to feel comfortable in one’s skin when also interacting with others.”
In an open discussion about an array of topics surrounding sexuality, Tillman and Bodney both answered questions around the importance of consent, communicating with one’s sexual partners about preferences and discomforts and how to approach such vulnerable conversations.
Bodney emphasized breaking the taboo of sex and other intimate matters.
“There’s a lot of unlearning … And then also in that unlearning, how do we shift the culture to be one that is open, that’s more communicative, that’s more consensual, that’s less shame-oriented, because we’re all humans, right?”
Nia Marshall, a senior majoring in arts, technology and the business of innovation, spoke on the benefits of events like the Sexploration Tent.
“I think college is a really interesting time because we all come into this university with different experiences [and] different knowledge,” Marshall said. “Not everybody received the same type of sex education growing up, whether that be formally in school or from their parents or other family members or friends.”
Representatives from Feelmore Adult’s Flagship also showcased their top sex toys and offered a raffle for Trojans on their most popular products. 
Tyler Trouillot, a senior majoring in business administration, attended the event and said he was impressed by such readily available resources regarding safe sex.
“When sex education is presented in such a healthy way like this, you can really be confident in yourself to make those decisions,” Trouillot said. “We were just going for a walk in the farmers market, noticed [the tent], popped in, saw a couple things and thought it was cool.”
Starting such an unprecedented topic of discussion required support from several organizations on campus including the Graduate Student Government, Undergraduate Student Government, Student Assembly for Gender Empowerment and Women and Youth Supporting Each Other with support from USC Student Health.
Recognizing the importance of educating USC students on what consent means, events like these open the discussion of what consent looks like. 
“These specific events are absolutely necessary, but they’re just one aspect of an entire infrastructure that has to be addressed and trusting that students know what they need for themselves or what they’re asking for is another huge component. Then, following suit to support them in the best ways that we can is absolutely imperative for us to change this into the safest campus we can,” Bodney said.
Bodney believes that in order to overcome the high rate of sexual abuse within society, institutions should begin with proper education on the matter.
“I am not the one Supreme Court justice who can shape things the way that they need to be shaped,” Bodney said. “I am not the one senate leader that can do that. It has to be something where we’re all working together… Understanding that those things take so much longer than any one person’s lifetime.”
Tillman also discussed how an issue as prevalent and systemic as sexual violence should be addressed. 
“Until American society in particular can get comfortable with eradicating shame and actually talking about these topics in ways that are accurate, it’s really just not going to change,” Tillman said. “How would it change? It comes from the top like the government, university leaders … leaders need to be part of the change, and if they aren’t, then it’s not going to change.”
A previous version of this article stated that there were dildos at the Sexploration Tent and that the tent was mainly curated by Student Health. There were no dildos at the event and several student organizations helped with its curation. The Daily Trojan regrets these errors.

Directed by School of Cinematic Arts alumnus Paul Feig, “The School for Good and Evil” is the film adaptation of Soman Chainani’s beloved book series of the same name. Released by Netflix on Oct. 19, the film is visually stunning with imagery fit for the most glorious fairy tales. Even without reading the books, it’s clear that the worldbuilding is impressively crafted and the concept — with its dynamic themes of friendship and identity — is incredibly original. 
“The School for Good and Evil” is the kind of source material uniquely suited for a cinematic adaptation. There’s no doubt Netflix did a spellbinding job of conveying it. With a runtime of a little more than two hours, though, “The School for Good and Evil” drags when it shouldn’t, especially given that there were so many elements that could have been given more nuanced qualities. 
Sophie (Sophia Anne Caruso) and Agatha (Sofia Wylie) are two best friends living in the village of Gavaldon. While Sophie is all sunshine, Agatha is her grumpier counterpart. Their opposite natures are what make their friendship so striking. Sophie, however, wishes to leave her mediocre life in Gavaldon and become a princess at the elusive fairy tale School for Good, where students are trained to become the heroes of their own story. As a result of Sophie’s wish, Sophie and Agatha are whisked away to the School for Good and Evil.
To her shock and disgust, Sophie is placed in the School for Evil, led by the blunt Lady Lesso (Charlize Theron). Agatha, on the other hand, is sent to the School for Good, led by the sugary sweet Professor Dovey (Kerry Washington). Both girls struggle to fit in in their respective placements. Sophie fights with the Nevers, students of the School for Evil; Agatha is shunned by the Evers, students of the School for Good. The two are insistent that they have been placed in the wrong schools, believing Sophie should be in the School for Good, while Agatha should be in the School for Evil. 
However, in order to be placed where they think they belong, Sophie must secure true love’s kiss. Sophie sets her eyes on the School for Good’s popular Prince Tedros (Jamie Flatters), whom Agatha later also crushes on. At the same time, Sophie’s discontent with being placed in the School for Evil has caused her to bond with the nefarious Rafal (Kit Young), the personification of evil who has come to Sophie seeking Evil’s world domination. Agatha must fight to save her friend from falling deeper into Evil and protect both schools from being destroyed by it.
One issue with the film is that it spends too much time on certain nonessential parts and too little time on other moments that seem like they could be crucial. A major part of the trailer’s appeal is Sophie’s acceptance of being Evil and the shocking transformation — in physical appearance and attitude — that occurs. 
However, this part isn’t given too much weight in the actual film, aside from a few dramatic entrances and a montage of Sophie bonding with her fellow Nevers. The thematic exploration of “Evil” being synonymous with being the underdog is a gripping idea, but unfortunately, it is underdeveloped here. That theme becomes superficial, as if empowering oneself is simply attained through a few costume changes. 
The transformation could have been more satisfying had there been more scenes of Sophie taking charge of her own situations. As the crux of Sophie’s narrative arc was her desire to not be powerless anymore, there needed to be more stakes involved in her powerlessness. In simple terms, there needed to be a more drastic change in circumstances after her decision to become confident in her classification as Evil. 
Other than the immature villagers of the town and Sophie’s own discontent with her annoying family, Sophie’s need to stay at the School seems rooted primarily in her own selfishness (which might be the point of her placement in the School for Evil). While this all makes sense, some information supporting an external need to leave would have presumably contributed to greater audience empathy with Sophie. As she is, Sophie comes across as mostly whiny and annoying, with very little character development aside from a “redemption” moment inconsistent with her behavior for the first three-quarters of the film. 
Audiences do get glimpses of why Nevers want to empower themselves given that they are constantly looked down upon by the Evers. Still, the most riveting part of the film should be Sophie’s acceptance of Evil, which falls flat in comparison to the film’s more eloquent explorations of friendship between Sophie and Agatha.
For a story that revolves around questioning what “good” and “evil” really are beyond their one-dimensional caricatures, the film doesn’t ultimately succeed in conveying exactly how students are placed into each school, which appears to be the story’s whole premise. 
With the sweeping expanses of both the schools, there is a wonderful dichotomy of good and evil, ambience-wise. Kerry Washington and Charlize Theron channel a lot of energy into their roles as Professor Dovey and Lady Lesso, respectively, and it does feel like they had a lot of fun doing it. Similarly, Sofia Wylie and Sophia Anne Caruso bring a lot of passion to their characters, and the bond between the two is keenly felt. 
Still, that doesn’t change the fact that maybe the story would have been better suited for a TV show. There, some character arcs could have received necessary attention with a format of multiple episodes. Had the conflict been drawn out, many elements might have been further developed, and the emotional investment would have been strengthened. For now, the film feels like a lesson that takes up too much time and only covers half the material.

On Oct. 4th, Prada Sport unveiled their new Fall/Winter 2022  campaign, starring influencer Charli D’Amelio shot by Norbert Schoerner, who is known for his work with Fendi, Adidas and Lady Gaga. While many oohed and aahed at the collection’s dreamy puffers and classic red rubber stripes, many immediately turned to Twitter to criticize the campaign. 
Some users were surprised they even chose her; she hadn’t done much modeling past red carpets and her own brand, Social Tourist (made in partnership with Hollister), and she was known for a more “girl next door” look compared to her sister, Dixie, who modeled for Valentino in December. However, I think it makes sense. 
Prada Sport is more casual than Prada, and is meant for the same age demographic as Charli and Dixie (older Gen-Zs and Millennials). At the same time, Charli hasn’t been relevant since season 1 of “The D’Amelio Show” on Hulu. But with her appearance on “Dancing with the Stars” and the release of season 2 of her titular show debuting at the end of September, she was back in the spotlight. 
But the biggest critique was that the campaign already looked like a bad movie poster, and having Charli instead of established models didn’t help. 
Again, I would have to disagree. I think Charli was giving Clover from District 2 of “The Hunger Games,” and the heavy dystopian snow kingdom is very on-par with the theme of the collection. According to Prada, they focused on “the interlacing of different universes [and] racing between one reality and another,” drawing inspiration from winter sports, adaptable and versatile fabrics and timeless pieces that are both high-performance and on theme with Prada’s minimalist identity. 
Still, this wasn’t Prada’s first bout with immediate hate from the fashion world. In their SS21 collection, they debuted a yellow turtleneck with dozens of circle cutouts. While some leaned into the possibility they were trying to mimic Off-White’s success with their signature circle cuts, the media backlash came from the £905 price tag (around $900) for a top that looked like swiss cheese. 
This then brings into question whose fault it is if a campaign flops. I think partially, it is creative and editing — styling an item poorly can make the most beautiful piece look cheap, and media graphics can make or break the campaign regardless of flawless styling and casting. And, obviously, poor modeling is always hard to look at — ahem, Kendall Jenner in pointe shoes in the Vogue Spain video. 
But even then, everyone can try their best and the campaign can still flop. I think the true and only culprit is the audience — and even then, we can’t fully blame them. 
The way anything is perceived can never be predicted. Audience reactions are so incredibly delicate since it depends on the circumstances of time, current events and even things as personal as a viewer’s emotional state when they see the campaign. 
Ultimately, all companies can do is research, be creative and hope for the best, because even then, bad press will drown all good press and advocacy. 
Maybe instead of holding our breaths, it’s time to start being a little kinder. I get it — some days I wake up, and I feel like I have been possessed by the devil himself. But, in those days, I still remind myself to be kind, to remember that everyone is (usually) trying their best and that nothing good comes out of being nasty. With the comfort of being online and behind the masks of random usernames, people seem to feel more and more comfortable spewing hate. 
But, even while writing this, I want the opinions of others online to be more bright, floral and filled with rainbows. Is it unfair to want people to hold back? To not voice their opinion? To not add on? And if so, should we just toughen up and remind ourselves that nothing is going to be liked by all?
I think a little bit of both, but even then, there’s nothing wrong with being a little kinder.

Hannah Schoettmer wants to change the narrative around poetry. 
Schoettmer, a junior majoring in cinema and media studies, debuted her first poetry collection, “Body Panopticon,” on Oct. 5. The chapbook is a compilation of Schoettmer’s poetry from the last two years. She consolidated 300 pages of work into the neat 26 pages available from Bottlecap Features, a subset of small indie publishing house Bottlecap press. Bottlecap Features is dedicated to publishing one chapbook weekly. 
For Schoettmer, the hardest part of writing poetry is the honesty required by the form. 
“There’s always an easy way out, there’s always an easy conclusion that you can draw on what you’re writing. And oftentimes, that’s not the essence of what you’re trying to say,” she said. “I like to think of poetry as a way to cut to the heart of something. Oftentimes, I’ll take something that may have happened or something that I’ve seen happen or I read about, and invent a language around it and a world around it, that lets me tell the truth about it.” 
Still, she finds herself especially drawn to poetry when she feels there is no other way to express her complex thoughts, especially on fleeting moments that are often overlooked and forgotten.
“A poem is sort of like a Polaroid,” she said. “In that, not only are you focusing on a single scene in a single moment but there’s an ephemeral reality to it. That poem is the only way that could be iterated.”
Her collection, “Body Panopticon,” features poems that are not necessarily connected, but follow the same themes of Midwestern and Southern pastoralism, queerness and legacies of abuse. However, as she writes, Schoettmer wants to make it clear that what she writes isn’t necessarily her. 
“I think this is a stereotype around poetry — they assume that everything that is written is literal… If a fiction writer goes up and reads something in the first person, you don’t assume that happened to them, you assume it’s fiction. So, I think the conflation of poetry and nonfiction is just something that is just strange to me,” Schoettmer said. “In synthesizing things into a poetic form, I take it from myself, and I give it away.”
Still, the themes included in the book are ones that she has “been chewing on in [her] brain for the past couple of years and crafting them into something that makes a larger statement.”
Despite her intense passion for poetry, she only began exploring it as a creative outlet during her senior year of high school. She started her writing journey focused on fiction. Originally, she wrote off poetry as a “dead art form” due to the fact she was only ever exposed to the works of “a bunch of dead white guys and maybe Emily Dickinson.” It was only once her creative writing teacher exposed her to contemporary poets that she fell in love with the medium. 
“People think poetry is boring because the poetry that people are exposed to is boring,” Schoettmer said.  “You just have to purge high school English and look out into the great horizon.” 
“I don’t see myself in ‘The Road Not Taken.’ Or, I do but come on, let’s move on, let’s keep going,” she joked. 
Schoettmer suggests people look for contemporary writers like her self-assigned “poetic mothers,” Diane Seuss and Denise Duhamel. 
“It’s like, why do you read a novel from 2017 instead of a novel from 1935? Because it’s from you, it’s from your world and your generation, and so it’s more accessible in that way,” she said. “There’s all types of [poetry], there’s genre poetry, there’s weird formal stuff going on, sound poetry, visual poetry, there’s really something for everyone.”
Schoettmer’s former roommate, Christine Im, said she had never thought about poetry before rooming with Schoettmer. 
“It never really hit me to the heart why people would write or read poems,” Im, a junior majoring in health and human sciences, said. “But after meeting Hannah, who was so passionate about her work, I started seeing a bit of the behind-the-scenes work and why people might find poetry so appealing.” 
When Schoettmer began the process of editing the collection, Im provided support in ordering the poems. Although she said it was nothing “formal,” she believes Schoettmer recruited her help to make the process more “interpersonal.”
“It’s really important to me to share work and create spaces in which other people can share work,” Schoettmer said. “Because it’s lonely and isolating, oftentimes, doing any type of writing, and bringing that into the community and space is important.”
On Thursday, Schoettmer will read selections from her chapbook at Small World Books in Venice, and she invited other writers to share their work at the event as well. Although she alleges L.A. is nowhere close to New York in terms of literary events, she said, “it should be, and it can be because there is interesting work being done here.” 
“The idea is just to create this space for writers to voice their works and share them with readers, especially young writers, up-and-coming writers,” said Tanaayaa (Tania Apshankar), a senior majoring in creative writing who will also be reading at the event. 
“Reading is a sensory event. You’re listening to someone, you’re listening to the emotion, you’re listening to the reactions of people around,” Tanaayaa said. “I think that events like these help build community in terms of inspiration for other writers, and also just a space to really feel like your art is being heard and being absorbed by someone else.”

With a tent draped in pride flags and hundreds of free pronoun pins, USC’s LGBTQ+ Student Center celebrated International Pronouns Day Wednesday. The event took place at Hahn Plaza, and was intended to help normalize preferred pronouns and make LGBTQ+ students feel supported on campus. 
As part of the festivities, the LGBTQ+ Student Center offered ten different sets of pronoun pins to students. Journey R., a senior majoring in human biology and employee of the LGBTQ+ Student Center, said that the LGBTQ+ center hoped to kickstart a conversation about how the University community can incorporate personal pronouns into everyday life.
“Even if you’re cisgender, including your pronouns in your Zoom name, wearing them as a pin on your shirt or your backpack, introducing yourself with your pronouns at meetings or in group settings, all of these things really help contribute to a trans positive and safe environment,” they said. 
Hassan B. Marong, a graduate student at the Rossier School of Education and employee of the LGBTQ+ Student Center, said that by starting this conversation, the LGBTQ+ Student Center was also able to educate people on how to use different pronouns.
“We have already had some people come to the table and ask about what different pronouns are, what they mean, why some of them are in Spanish and what the different flags mean,” he said. “I hope it’s an educational point for people and that they can then take that information and educate people in their everyday lives.”
Marong went on to state the importance of having an open dialogue around pronouns on college campuses.
“When I first came to college, I had never really heard of pronouns. It wasn’t until I heard someone introduce themselves with their pronouns that I was like, ‘oh, that’s important because not everybody is going to be he/him or she/her, and it’s important to not assume people’s pronouns.’ I hope that this table is going to start that conversation with other people, and trickle on to their families and their friends,” he said. 
The Student Center also organized an activity where students could write down how they could incorporate pronouns into their daily lives. Megan van der Toorn, who oversees the LGBTQ+ Student Center and gender equity resources, said that the event was meant to inspire people to consider how they could make their space more inclusive. 
“[This activity ensures that] it’s not just a one and done grab a button and go,” van der Toorn said, “It’s actually really thinking about, what can I do to affirm others? What can I do to help create more inclusive spaces across campus?”
She also emphasized how important it is for students to see faculty participating in these advocacy and educational events.
“What we’ve tried to do is…help our students feel like there are other people doing this advocacy for them, this awareness raising for them so that they’re not always having to be the one to do the education,” van der Toorn said.
Marong said it is important to celebrate this day on campus, not only because of how essential pronouns are, but also to make campus a more welcoming space.
“Pronouns are very important and very dear to people’s hearts, it’s how they identify,” he said. “We are trying to, as USC, make sure that we’re inclusive to people in that people are feeling welcome in our space, however they identify on the gender spectrum. I hope that’s what this celebration of pronouns will do for other people.” 
Journey also said that the LGBTQ+ Student Center’s fight to make campus a more equitable place does not stop at International Pronoun Day.
“Right now we’re in the process of trying to get more gender neutral bathrooms,” they said. “Another thing we’re working towards is just normalizing the concept of pronouns, and raising awareness about nonbinary genders as well. All those are helpful things that can make trans students feel safe.”
Overall, van der Toorn said that they will consider their efforts for International Pronoun Day a success if they help even one student feel safer on campus.
“Hopefully, we can change one person, make it easier for one student, faculty or staff member on this campus to be authentically who they are and to be seen for who they are,” they said.

After winning their fifth and sixth games in a row against No. 17 University of Oregon and Oregon State, the women’s volleyball team will head to Northern California to take on the University of California, Berkeley and Stanford this weekend. The Trojans are 15-4 overall and tied  with No. 7 Stanford for first place in the Pac-12 as they look to beat the Golden Bears and the Cardinal. 
USC won their last two matches by scores of 3-1 with two 20+ kill performances from senior outside hitter Skylar Fields and two 20-dig performances from freshman libero Gala Trubint. These performances earned the pair Pac-12 offensive and defensive player of the week respectively; this was Fields’s third week in a row winning the award, and Trubint’s second in a row. 
Head Coach Brad Keller spoke about the importance of the pair to the team. 
“I love this team,” Keller said. “I love those two, I love the entire group. I just love the commitment to their craft and trying to make themselves and the team better and how they lean into it. I can’t say enough about them.”
This team is relatively new together, with only a few players who could train together in the spring. Keller has stressed the importance of building a strong culture, which he thinks is a key reason for their success thus far.
“I think we’re not as polished as some of these other teams are, but we’re more tied in together and we’re more like a group or an adhesive unit at this point,” Keller said. 
Coach’s message has made an impact on the team, who has bought into his message.
“So I think a lot of the success we’ve achieved thus far… it’s just building off of the culture that we’ve created and are continuing to create, especially with a brand new team, a lot of newcomers,” Trubint said. “So when we get out there to play, we know what we’re doing and we’re on the same page. And when we’re not, we’re talking about it a lot, so I think a lot of that’s paying off.”
Last week at practice, the team focused on their serving, an integral part of their wins against Oregon and Oregon State.
“Our serving has been getting a lot better over the past few games,” Trubint said, “We’ve been putting teams in tough situations, really good passing teams like Oregon… and I think we were able to get them out of system and isolate some of their good players.”
The team’s matchup against Stanford could give the winner sole-control of the Pac-12, however Coach Keller sees it as any other game on the schedule.
“I don’t mean any disrespect, but it would just be another win in-conference,” Keller said. “I understand, it’s Stanford, it’s a ranked opponent, it’s on the road, but our goal is not to beat Stanford, our goal is to get to a national championship…. Stanford is already a team, obviously the number seven team in the country, and is already a championship-caliber team. We’re trying to catch that.”
The Trojans are currently on the fringe of the American Volleyball Coaches Association rankings and with two wins against Berkeley and Stanford, they will likely crack the Top 25.
USC will take on Berkeley on Friday at 7 p.m., and Stanford on Sunday at 1 p.m.

The postseason isn’t even halfway over, and we’ve already experienced some of the most breathtakingly, soul-crushingly beautiful moments in playoff history. Let’s check in on our four contenders, and see how even the most unlikely of squads can capture the trophy.
We’re nearly at the endgame now. With the New York Yankees’ 5-1 victory over the Cleveland Guardians on Tuesday, the final Championship Series contender earned their spot at the table. The National League Champions Series  kicked off on Tuesday night, with the Philadelphia Phillies besting the San Diego Padres, 2-0, largely thanks to a dominant performance from Phils starting pitcher Zach Wheeler and a 488-foot nuke off the bat of outfielder Kyle Schwarber. The American League Champions Series  began a day later in Houston, marking the start of the battle for a spot in the World Series between the Houston Astros and New York Yankees.
Overall, I can’t say I’m upset with how my predictions turned out. On the American League side, my bracket remains perfect. The Cleveland Guardians (and Oscar Gonzalez) swept the Tampa Bay Rays in two games. I knew Tampa couldn’t handle Cleveland’s pitching staff, but I did not expect both teams to act like they were swinging broom handles at the plate. In the American League Division Series, Cleveland continued the late-game heroics, yanking a 2-1 series lead with a come-from-behind ninth inning walk off in Game 3. However, the Guardians ultimately struggled to put the Yankees away, losing their eleventh straight elimination game in the process.
Seattle Mariners fans, despite the ALDS sweep, probably would’ve been happy if the series went a mere inning. They were back in the postseason after two decades plus of disappointment and promptly swept their first October series over the Toronto Blue Jays. The Division Series against Houston turned out to be a different animal, with designated hitter  Yordan Alvarez looking like a man possessed. Game 3 went the distance — lasting all of 18 innings before a solo shot from Houston shortstop Jeremy Peña finished the Astros sweep of Seattle.
I can’t really justify my National League picks. I could sit here and argue that it was unfair for the 101-win New York Mets to play in the Wild Card anway. Same goes for the Los Angeles Dodgers and Atlanta Braves, who should’ve just been given byes to the NLCS anyway, right? Unfortunately, I did not think the sub-90 win Padres and Phillies had that dog in them, and probably the most unlikely NLCS matchup we could have seen this year has arrived. As for my League Championship Series (and World Series) predictions, I expect nothing less than to go three-for-three.
Houston remains the top dog in the American League. Plain and simple. Pitch them your best, they will pitch better. Try to outslug them? Good luck. This year marks Houston’s sixth-straight ALCS appearance, an American League record. Third baseman Alex Bregman and second baseman Jose Altuve are great, but then there’s Alvarez, who remains the most dominant force left in this year’s postseason and, quite simply, a tier above everyone else.  That’s including Aaron Judge, who’s paltry .738 OPS in the ALDS knocked him from the top spot. However, I see it coming down to the pitching staff. The Yankees 1-2 punch in Gerrit Cole and Nestor Cortes sure is nasty, but the bullpen is middling. The loss of Michael King months ago really put a hole in the middle relief spot, and New York has struggled to fill that role. Other than Clay Holmes and Wandy Peralta, there’s not many I would trust. Over a seven game series, against one of the deepest offenses in the league? Sounds a bit too dicey. Give me Houston in six.
The Padres and Phillies matchup is perplexing. On one hand, super sluggers Juan Soto and Manny Machado could lead the Padres to victory. On the other hand, Phillies stars Bryce Harper and Kyle Schwarber have been on fire in the postseason. Decisions, decisions. Look, I expect this series to be an absolute slugfest, a far cry from what we saw in Game 1. Philly has the edge in starting pitching, although it is a strong point on both sides. But the bullpen slightly favors San Diego, with closer Josh Hader serving as the cherry on top. At the onset of the series, Fangraphs-generated playoff odds gave an ever-so-slight edge to the Friars, but why trust a computer simulation when I have something better: blind gut instinct. So give me Philadelphia in seven. Bryce Harper in Phillies colors, fighting in the World Series — my worst nightmare as a Washington Nationals fan.
Philadelphia vs. Houston. David vs. Goliath. To come so far is quite the accomplishment for the upstart Phils in their first postseason appearance in over a decade. However, it is sad to see how quickly they will be dispatched by Major League Baseball’s very own Godzilla. The Astros are built for any scenario. Throw out a team full of prime Barry Bonds, and they’d probably find a way to push it to six games. Alvarez, Bregman, Altuve and Peña can carry the load offensively, while the Houston bullpen tandem of Bryan Abreu, -Ryne Stanek and Ryan Pressly can shut them down in the later innings. As a result, I expect Houston to win the series in five games, emphatically securing Houston’s second title in franchise history, and their first since being busted for trash-can banging during their 2017 run. While the Braves stood against a similar juggernaut last year, they were a once-in-a-lifetime scenario. I mean, a red-hot NL East team can’t beat Houston in the World Series again, can it? Hey, who knows. It wouldn’t be the first time.
In my next column, the season will be nearing a close, knee-deep in the World Series, with the offseason and free agency looming overhead.

“Maybe she’s born with it, maybe it’s Maybelline.” I laugh at those commercials because I wish the newest neutrals palette from Maybelline was what keeps me going these days of ravaging chronic pain, but it isn’t — it’s ketamine. 
I was introduced to the drug at a desperate time when I was starting my third month of “status migrainosus” — a sustained migraine attack lasting longer than 72 hours with no break. I was in nausea-inducing, light-avoiding, head-crippling pain. 
I’d been hospitalized already at Mayo Clinic Scottsdale looking for relief but to no avail — though it was an extra special stay because I had my first spinal tap (cue cute hair flip). Back home and half-alive, my Mom hauled me to the Balboa Naval Hospital in San Diego, and that’s when things began to change. After being admitted again, a nurse said pain management and anesthesiology were en route. Excuse moi? A speciality for pain? Where have they been all my life?
Despite my excitement, I didn’t have high hopes because my pain hadn’t relented to any treatment yet, and migraines have a long history of being misunderstood as “just a headache” when in reality, it’s a neurological disease. Not to mention, as a young woman, some doctors dismissed my pain as anxiety-induced or hormonal like it was the 1800s and hysteria was the only answer for why women had any medical issues or started having opinions. As a result, I’d come to understand myself as someone who’d never be a candidate for true pain relief.
Nevertheless, in walked a team of doctors, led by a 6’4” physician who my mother would describe as “the missing Hemsworth brother”— a Navy SEAL turned pain management specialist who treated literal SEALs.  It was clear by the look on his face he expected to walk in and see one of his fellow brothers, maybe with shrapnel in his back, but instead he saw me — no fucking way a Navy doc treating our nation’s highest trained military operatives was going to take my invisible pain seriously. 
To my surprise, the missing Hemsworth evaluated me with patience, listened to my story, acknowledged my suffering and said he understood the severity of my pain. “I’m going to do everything in my power to give you relief,” he said. “Have you tried ketamine?” I lit up with hope for the first time in months.
While too much is deadly and street ketamine can be fatal as it is often laced with lethal substances like fentanyl, medical-grade prescribed ketamine has been proven to treat post-traumatic stress disorder, phantom limb pain, and it’s even used in low doses on kids in the ER. The controlled dissociative effect is its superpower — or so I thought.
We started the 24/7 IV drip of ketamine, and within an hour I finally got relief, but not without severe side effects. The goal was to tolerate the paranoia and losing touch with reality as long as possible so my brain could bathe in the sweet reset nectar. The IV ketamine was great while it was flowing, but upon discharge and a few days later, all my symptoms came back. I was hospitalized twice more and received 24/7 ketamine again to try and “break” the migraine, but the side effects were too traumatizing to go on. 
Amidst the other trials of treatments, like surgery to burn a nerve in my neck responsible for migraine, an incredibly smart and Maybelline modelesque anesthesiologist and pain management doctor at USC asked if I’d ever tried ketamine lozenges. “Like cough drops?” I said. “Exactly.” She paired them with oxytocin lozenges to provide additional relief and the final result was a miracle. It gave me relief with no side effects and helped get my body back in semi-functional order. 
Halle-fucking-lujah. Yet I remained baffled: Why had my pain relief not been adequately addressed until I’d seen a pain management doctor? 
In a country with an ongoing opioid epidemic and where ketamine isn’t known for pain management, I was scared into believing drugs for pain, aside from Ibuprofen, are dangerous, addictive and should be avoided. But that’s half the picture. Pain relief is also stigmatized, especially for young people like me who are assumed to be resilient, not disabled or immobilized by pain. I thought taking any medication to relieve my pain, especially a controlled substance like ketamine, was naughty. Even worse, I thought accepting pain treatment meant admitting defeat to my diseases.  
It shouldn’t take the SEALs’ doctor, or matter that my pain is invisible, to get relief; what should matter is that demanding relief is not admitting defeat, something to shame or a reason to assume the worst of people, it’s demanding a quality of life. Yes, chronic pain is notoriously difficult to treat, but it isn’t a reason to give up on patients, it’s a reason to innovate, as in the case of my Special-K lozenges. 
Today, I live life with ketamine stocked in my fridge at all times, prescribed and monitored by a pain management doctor. Do I use it regularly? No, sometimes I go a month without touching it. But during bad pain flares, it’s my saving grace. Without it, I would have to be hospitalized by pain flares, which is about once a month. 
It’s so normalized to me now that the first time I went over to my boyfriend’s place I brought a tin of the lozenges to put in his fridge. “Don’t freak out, it’s ketamine.” His eyebrows shot up until I explained all I just relayed to you. You could say that was part of our meet-cute. 
So if you’re listening, Maybelline, hit me up. I think a chronic pain awareness campaign starring me (obviously) would be an incredible brand expanding partnership, tagline: “Maybe she’s born with it, maybe it’s Ketamine.”

Assuming the majority of your life has fallen between the years 1990 and 2022, I’m going to go out on a limb and guess that you read most of your news online: unless you’re a Mennonite, a newspaper purist, some sort of masochist that enjoys greatly inconveniencing yourself — and/or my journalism professor. Whatever the case, you do you. 
A 2021 Pew Research Center poll found that of the overwhelming majority of Americans who get their news online, most directly visit websites or apps to read their media. The one exception was the 18-29-year-old age group, which reported more often getting news from social media.
But newsletters have four big advantages over social media and aggregate services like Google News or Apple News, or just checking a newspaper’s website:
(1) The newsletter is a finite experience; there’s a set start and end point, which means you don’t get sucked into endlessly scrolling through an app. 
(2) It’s a lot easier to set a routine around reading newsletters. You might read a morning newsletter at breakfast, then an evening newsletter as you get ready for bed. There’s no pressure to keep checking the news all day, so long as you commit to receiving your news almost entirely from those emails.
(3) A team of journalists selects the stories you read, not the whims of some social media algorithm that’ll keep you in a bubble.
(4) You see the day’s stories in context, side-by-side with other headlines; a newsletter is a sort of time capsule of the period it covers.
This is where the Mennonites say, “Why not just read a print paper? Wouldn’t that solve all those problems?” To which I reply: Broadsheet newspapers are a pain in the ass. They’re massive, the text is tiny, the ink smears, it’s awkward to turn the pages, so on and so forth. Newsletters marry most everything good about broadsheets, with the added bonus of actually being convenient. 
So let’s say you’re starting from scratch: You have no newspaper subscriptions, aren’t signed up for any newsletters and maybe don’t even read the news that often. Where should you look?
Start with the basics. At a bare minimum, you should subscribe to a major national newspaper with a large circulation — think The New York Times, The Washington Post and The Wall Street Journal. 
Those are generally considered the American newspapers of record, but depending on who you ask, the Los Angeles Times might also fall in that category. If you’re a USC student, you should be able to get free subscriptions to all of those but the Post.
If you really don’t want to spend money on a subscription, you could read exclusively from wire services like the Associated Press or Reuters which don’t have paywalls on their websites, but you’re likely going to miss out on original investigative journalism. New digital publications like Axios or Semafor are a good option too.
Once you have that covered, look for a local paper. The Los Angeles Times does a good job of coverage in the L.A. area, but if you want a more hyper-local look, consider subscribing to Los Angeles Daily News, which will give you access to journalism across the Southern California News Group. Maybe you’ll want to subscribe to your hometown paper, or also consider subscribing to magazines or the foreign press.
You’ve also probably heard time and time again that it’s important to get your news from a range of sources, so you can have a diverse view of the world. Honestly, I think if you want to have any view of the world in the first place, it’s more important to subscribe to papers that cover the news at different scales (national, state, local, etc.) than at different viewpoints (liberal, conservative, etc.).
If you’re never going to touch the opinion sections, the hard news reporting in the major national papers will give you more or less the same stories.
When choosing your subscriptions, consider checking out the suite of newsletters that each offers — if there’s a newsletter whose format or writing you particularly like, subscribe to that paper so you can read the stories that the emails link to. Also consider that it’s important you don’t inundate yourself with so much media that you never read any of it.
Another option is to read a third-party newsletter like Morning Brew, a “daily email newsletter covering the latest news from Wall St. to Silicon Valley,” or one that I write called Morning, Trojan, where I summarize and link to campus stories from the Daily Trojan and Annenberg Media, alongside L.A. County and state news from professional outlets. 
I should probably confess that as part of my job writing Morning, Trojan, I do a deep dive through dozens of websites and social media accounts every night to find the best stories, so a good chunk of my news isn’t coming from newsletters — but if I was only reading for myself, it would. 
And a quick bonus tip: I don’t have any newspaper apps downloaded on my phone. When I see a story I find interesting in a newsletter, I add it to my Safari reading list. That means there’s one place I can go to on multiple devices to see all my saved stories across all my subscriptions, rather than having to open each website or app individually.
It’s totally possible that your news-reading routine will look similar to mine, and it’s also totally possible that what I do just won’t work for you. All that matters is that you work out a solution that’s going to tread the fine line between keeping you informed and sane — and that line’s going to be different for everyone.
