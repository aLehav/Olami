The USC men’s tennis team’s strong start to the season continued last Friday as it dropped just one point in a double header against UC Davis and the University of San Francisco.
The early matches saw the Trojans take on a UC Davis team that entered the day undefeated. Despite the Aggies’ previous success, the new pairing of freshman Mor Bulis and senior Jack Jaede dominated in doubles for a 6-1 victory. Junior Brandon Holt and senior Logan Smith, however, dropped their set 4-6. Freshman Jake Sands and redshirt junior Jake DeVine played the deciding set, leading the Aggies 5-2 before falling 6-7 (4) in the tiebreaker.
Down a point going into singles, the Trojans quickly turned things around. It started with DeVine, who served up a bagel in a 6-0, 6-4 victory. Holt quickly followed suit with a pair of breadsticks in his 6-1, 6-1 victory. Jaede and Smith both piled up wins at 6-4, 6-2 and 6-0, 7-5, respectively, to give the Trojans a comeback win. Sophomore Daniel Cuckierman provided the fifth point with a 6-3, 6-3 win and Bulis clinched the sixth point with a 4-6, 6-1, 6-2 win to close out the morning matchup.
Redshirt senior Tanner Smith made his season debut against USF, as he paired up with Cuckierman in doubles to win 6-3. Jaede and Sands won their set 6-4. Junior Riley Smith and Bulis had the same score of 6-4 and the Trojans took the doubles point.
Singles action saw Riley Smith dominate his match with a 6-0, 6-3 victory to put USC up 2-0. DeVine soon followed with a 6-2, 6-2 win of his own. After shaking off some early rust in his match, Tanner Smith clinched the fourth point for the Trojans with a 6-4, 6-4 victory. After the coaches agreed that the matches in progress all be played out, freshman Bradley Frye was the next Trojan to win with a score of 6-3, 6-3. 
After dominating the first set, Cuckierman was able to tough out a tight second set to get a 6-0, 7-6 (2) victory. Sands closed out the day with a 6-4, 6-4 win and secured USC’s shutout of USF. 
After dropping the early doubles point, USC was able to buckle down and roll right through the two teams, doing so with heavily rotated lineups due to the double header. Despite the hot start, the Trojans are not letting their 5-0 record get to their heads. 
“I’m very happy with the way this season has started, [it’s] off to a very good start,” Sands said. “But we have a long ways to go and I look forward to what is to come.” 
Bulis mentioned that the team has high expectations to meet this year. 
“I think the expectation is to go to the end, to win the NCAA title,” he said. “We want to go all the way, we definitely have the potential to, but we just need to stay focused. We’ve realized it is going to be a long season and we’ve just got to take it one match at a time.”
After what could be considered a disappointing 2017-18 season where they lost in the finals of the Pac-12 tournament and the quarterfinals of the NCAA tournament, the Trojans are looking to improve their game. So far, the early returns on this season look promising, but the first real test comes this weekend when USC takes on rivals Stanford and Cal.

For a team that has consistently seen disappointment this season, the USC women’s basketball team is riding a hot streak. After winning only one game during the first eight contests of conference play, the Women of Troy turned the tables by beating both schools from Washington last weekend, scoring over 80 points in each matchup.
On Friday, the Trojans defeated Washington 82-57 at Galen Center. Redshirt freshman guard Shalexxus Aaron scored a career-high 28 points in the game. Aaron, who won Pac-12 Player of the Week, said her teammates served as her main support system throughout the game.
“Every time I made a shot they’re like, ‘Hey, let’s go,’” Aaron said. “And every time I missed, they were like, ‘Keep shooting.’ My teammates believed in me, my coach believed in me, so I just knocked it down.”
The Huskies were on the board early in the first quarter, hitting three consecutive 3-pointers to start the game. However, the Women of Troy were able to bring the deficit down to one possession with scores from redshirt sophomore forward Asiah Jones and junior forward Kayla Overbeck. 
The Women of Troy’s two career 1,000-point scorers, senior guard Aliyah Mazyck and junior guard Minyon Moore, also contributed on the offensive end with 2 points each. Both teams were able to force multiple turnovers in the quarter. USC had five steals — two each from Moore and Mazyck and one from Aaron. 
Washington extended its lead in the beginning of the second quarter with two 3-pointers and continued to lead with five minutes remaining in the half. But a steal, fastbreak score and a three from Mazyck rallied the Trojans. With 30 seconds to play, a backcourt steal from Moore led to a breakaway layup that gave USC its first lead since the start of the game. The Trojans entered halftime up 34-31. 
Freshman forward Darcy Rees led the Huskies with 8 points, but USC shot a blistering 66.6 percent from the field. The Trojans also forced 16 first-half turnovers. 
An Aaron 3-pointer started the second half, and Overbeck scored in the post after forcing a shot-clock violation to give USC a two-possession lead. The Huskies were forced to call a timeout with six minutes left in the quarter, when another Aaron three gave USC a 49-34 advantage, capping a 15-3 run. The Huskies’ poor shooting highlighted the quarter, as Washington was only 1-for-11 from the field. 
“I wouldn’t have a career high if it wasn’t for my teammates, so I want to congratulate them and thank them first,” Aaron said. “They made an extra emphasis to look for me on the 3-point line … That’s how I was able to knock down those shots.”
The Trojans proved to be too much for the Huskies, continuing to break away in the fourth quarter. In the last two minutes, the Trojans boasted their largest lead of the game at 26 points, en route to an easy victory. 
USC had a balanced attack, with five players ending the game in double figures. 
Aaron attained her career high in efficient fashion, shooting 10-14 from the field and 6-of-10 from beyond-the-arc in 33 minutes of action. Minyon Moore had a game-high 12 assists, and Minyon Moore, Mazyck and junior forward Ja’Tavia Tapley combined for 15 rebounds.
“Washington State is a good team,” Aaron said, looking ahead to the next game. “We go over the game plan, and we look at the little things, and we just lock in. If we stick to the game plan, and we’re together, we’ll have fun.”
On Sunday, the Trojans defeated Washington State 81-73 at home on the back of a strong second half performance. After trailing by 1 point at the half, the Trojans took control in the third quarter, scoring 25 points to the Cougars’ 19. In the fourth quarter, the Trojans separated themselves from the Cougars, taking control of the ball for most of the last 10 minutes. 
Both teams had a healthy field goal percentage in the first half, each hitting over 60 percent of their shots. Furthermore, the Cougars shot well beyond the arc, hitting five out of seven 3-point tries they attempted. The Trojans finished the game with 32 rebounds and made over half the shots that they took.
Mazyck led all players with 27 points. In addition, Moore showed why she has been the team’s star all season long, playing every minute and scoring 21 points. 
The Trojans will take on the Utah Utes in Salt Lake City Friday.

The 21st century New England Patriots, the greatest football dynasty of all time, have always been personified by two people — quarterback Tom Brady and head coach Bill Belichick. Those are the only two people who have been in place from their first Super Bowl win against the then-St. Louis Rams in 2002 straight through to Sunday’s 13-3 victory over the Los Angeles Rams that gave the franchise its sixth championship.
The Patriots are the Patriots because of Brady and Belichick. Each has been called the greatest of all time at his position because of the incredible accomplishments they’ve achieved together: six Super Bowl wins, 13 AFC title game appearances (including eight straight through this season) and 16 division wins in the last 18 years. Their track record is unassailable.
And yet the sustainability of the Patriots’ dynasty came into serious question in the last calendar year. After losing 41-33 to the Eagles in last year’s Super Bowl, the Patriots said goodbye to many players crucial to recent championships, such as receiver Danny Amendola and left tackle Nate Solder. The Patriots struggled (by their standards) to an 11-5 record this season, losing by double digits to three non-playoff teams. Fans and media alike began to have real doubts about the old infrastructure.
Careful observers saw cracks in Belichick’s decision-making, starting with the strange choice to bench former cornerback and Super Bowl hero Malcolm Butler against the Eagles. Despite three touchdowns and 505 passing yards from Brady (a Super Bowl record), the Patriots lost because they allowed more than 40 points — only the sixth time that happened under Belichick’s leadership.
The questions persisted after New England allowed over 30 points to three of the bottom six scoring offenses in the league with losses to Jacksonville, Tenn. and Miami this season. Derision crested with Belichick’s questionable decision to put a noticeably slowed Rob Gronkowski in to defend Miami’s desperate bid for a final touchdown from 69 yards out. Miami was never going to throw the ball far enough for Gronkowski’s height to be a major factor and the lumbering tight end slipping and failing to catch Kenyan Drake on the walk-off, game-winning touchdown was the key image of what appeared to be the end of an era.
But if this stretch had caused anyone to revoke Belichick’s status as the greatest coach ever, he reclaimed it with a vengeance in the playoffs. Belichick is best known as a defensive mastermind, and nowhere was that more apparent than on the NFL’s biggest stage. 
Against the sixth- and first-ranked scoring offenses in the Chargers and Chiefs, respectively, the Patriots allowed a combined 7 first-half points, allowing New England to build large enough leads to ultimately win each game. Somehow, the Patriots shut out a historically good Chiefs offense in the first half on the road, holding quarterback and league MVP Patrick Mahomes to just 65 yards on four completions. Some of the credit has to go to linebackers coach and defensive playcaller Brian Flores, who will become the head coach of the Dolphins, but the preparation and schemes were classic Belichick.
The Super Bowl was the jewel of Belichick’s already sterling collection of big game performances. The Rams, the league’s second-ranked scoring offense, were completely flustered all game, getting shut out in the first half and managing just a measly third quarter field goal. Quarterback Jared Goff completed just 19 of 38 passes for 229 yards and a backbreaking fourth-quarter interception when the Rams were driving to tie the game. Rams star running back Todd Gurley carried just 10 times for 35 yards and was a non-factor in the passing game.
Three things made Belichick’s performance so impressive: First, there aren’t many stars on the Patriot defense. Cornerback Stephon Gilmore, who snagged the crucial interception, was the only Patriot defender to make the All-Pro or Pro Bowl rosters this season. Yet New England filled every gap and defended every pass because Belichick instilled in them the discipline to follow the game plan.
Second, Belichick developed a strategy that simultaneously subverted expectations and used strengths the Patriots have displayed throughout the postseason. After playing more man-to-man coverage than any team during the regular season, Belichick identified Goff’s inability to make complex reads as a weakness to exploit, coming out in zone coverage and maintaining it for most of the game. At the same time, he continued to call for complex stunts and twists to confuse the Rams offensive line, scheming his defensive linemen and linebackers into free runs at Goff to the tune of four sacks and 12 quarterback hits.
Third, Belichick completely out-coached the young and brilliant Sean McVay. McVay’s creative offensive concepts created so much production this year that every NFL team with a job opening started hiring coaches with even a small connection to the Rams coach. Belichick, twice McVay’s age at 66, gave the youngster an education in big-game coaching, thoroughly dominating the matchup to the point that even McVay had to admit so afterward.
Belichick has never been the type to publicly address the storylines that motivate him and his team, but he definitely hears the noise. He seeks out bulletin board material, like when he pointedly described the Eagles’ pre-planned victory parade to his players before the teams played in the 2005 Super Bowl. Belichick didn’t need the motivation of proving doubters wrong to put on a virtuoso coaching performance in the biggest game, but he certainly addressed the whispers that he had lost his fastball in reaffirming his place as the greatest football coach ever.

I remember downloading Snapchat for the first time my sophomore year of high school when the platform was all the rage. I was riding the bus home and sitting next to my friend who was using the app, so I downloaded it too (because most of my decisions were that simple in high school). From there, I added Snapchat to my daily routine — sending snaps, watching stories and perusing the Discover page. I definitely had an unhealthy obsession back then.
Now, a few years down the road, I check the app at most once every other day while I increasingly turn to Instagram, Facebook and Twitter. Even when my professors at the Annenberg routinely survey the class about which social media platforms students frequently use, the number of hands raised for Snapchat dwindles with each passing semester.
So, from beloved to tossed aside, what happened to Snapchat? Well, it’s a bit of a turbulent path.
CEO and co-founder Evan Spiegel first launched the app from the living room of his father’s home in July 2011. Two years later, around the same time “stories” were added to the platform, Facebook attempted to buy out Snapchat for $3 billion, an offer Spiegel declined. Come August 2014, 40 percent of adults in the United States were using the app on a daily basis.
But Snapchat’s growth didn’t end there. In following years, Snapchat rolled out “Discover,” “Lenses” (filters), “Snapstreaks,” “Memories” and integrated Bitmojis, all of which have remained integral to the app. The company received a significantly larger buyout offer — this time valued at $30 billion from Google —which Spiegel declined again. Snapchat was the “it” platform at the moment, and nothing could seem to knock it down.
In the same year, it turned over its best quarter yet, however, Instagram rolled out its own version of user stories in August 2016. This was the turning point that ultimately led to Snapchat’s eventual downfall.
Users of both platforms were originally repulsed by Instagram stories, which were merely used as an outlet for users to post Snapchat handles and dismiss the new tool altogether. Over time, though, users became accustomed to seeing stories appear at the top of their feed and slowly began experimenting with the feature. 
At first, many users would post the exact same content to both Snapchat and Instagram without a second thought. Now, Instagram Stories have evolved into a beast of their own, amplified by doodles, GIFs and location tags  — all elements that Snapchat has, sure, but Instagram just does it better. Namely, Instagram Stories has become an important element for brand pages and audience engagement that goes beyond a simple post.
To make matters worse, Kylie Jenner — who previously used Snapchat to engage with her fans, generate hype surrounding her company Kylie Cosmetics and bring millions of users to the platform in the process tweeted in February: “Sooo does anyone else use Snapchat anymore? Or is it just me … ugh this is so sad.” 
Her audience primarily comprises teens and young adults — Snapchat’s primary demographic — and her tweet received over 365,000 likes in agreement.
The result of her statements? Snapchat’s market value was sliced off overnight by more than $1.5 billion. Kylie now keeps to Instagram to engage her audience and post daily content about her lifestyle, which has only continued to increase her following.
“Still love you tho snap,” Jenner tweeted as a follow-up. “My first love.”
Though the declining numbers don’t paint a pretty economic picture for the company, Snapchat may not be as dead as many people perceive it to be. Before Instagram Stories became more prominent, The New York Times called Snapchat “the place where you go to be yourself,” a sentiment that I believe still stands. 
Whereas Instagram, Facebook and Twitter present a curated feed filled with friends, brands, news, professional connections and memes alike, Snapchat remains full of altogether less-filtered, organic moments. (Translation: the low-quality content I make on Snapchat will never go on my Instagram, for sure). Plus, Snapchat is significantly easier to make private and keep to a close circle of friends than other platforms, a big plus for Gen-Z individuals concerned about being too accessible online.
Still, Snapchat’s rapid rise to popularity and even faster plummet to insignificance cannot be ignored when thinking of the institution of social media at large. As various media platforms have come and gone (Vine, anyone?), what’s here to stay and on the way out in the age of rapid-fire social media will be a defining cultural component for current generations and for ones to come.

USC Visions and Voices collaborated with the School of Cinematic Arts to present a broadcast of “The Met in HD: George Bizet’s ‘Carmen’” on Feb. 2 at the Eileen Norris Cinema Theater.
Following a discussion held by Thornton School of Music chair of vocal arts and resident stage director Ken Cazan, the three-hour performance deals with concerns of destiny, love, freedom and female self-expression. 
“‘Carmen’ is truly one of my favorite operas,” Cazan said in his pre-opera presentation. “I’ve been able to direct it dozens of times … dramatically, it’s brilliant. It has humor, it has pathos, it has psychopathic killers.”
Cazan acknowledged his special connection with the main character’s background and talked briefly about his own roots with the history of the piece. 
“I had never met any of my Romanian relatives until I was about 12 years old,” Cazan said. “I had no idea I had this gypsy background. … I recreated [a memorable visit from the Gypsies] in my very first production of  ‘Carmen’ with cars and parcels piled up on top of them, with guns and stuff they were smuggling. It really came full circle.”
According to Cazan, Carmen represents a free spirit, an unbound antihero who simultaneously drives the opera’s plot through seduction and invention, who is herself destined to follow the path of fate at the end of the piece. 
“‘Carmen’ scandalized its initial audiences,” Cazan said. “The artistic director found it a very repulsive piece. He found the characters repulsive, he found the sexualism repulsive, he found the over-sensualism of the piece repulsive. The general manager said, ‘This is going to make us a fortune.’”
In his eyes, Carmen uses her feminine prowess to advance her social status and keep herself out of harm’s way.
“She wants something better, and she is going to get it, and no one is going to stand in her way,” Cazan said “That’s way ahead of its time … sadly, she’s also a victim of her time.”
 Students at the event said they enjoyed the opera. Rachel Glass, a freshman majoring in business administration, expressed such a view.
“A lot operas are about betrayal, about love, circled around love,” Glass said. “I thought the idea that her main goal was to be free … I don’t know if she ever really did love anybody. She might have loved the freedom that they could give her but I don’t know if she ever truly loved anybody.” 
Mary Jabagchourian, a freshman pre-nursing student at the College of the Canyons, also spoke of her fascination with the production
“I’m an avid musical and play-goer, and this was also my first opera,” said Jabagchourian. “The music just captured me and the plot was amazing. ”
“Carmen” isn’t the only opera SCA is presenting this semester — the school  will host a live screening of Gaetano Donizetti’s “La Fille du Régiment” on March 2 and a screening of Richard Wagner’s “Die Walküre” on March 30. at 9 a.m.

Los Angeles held its first Vegan Fashion Week this past weekend, demonstrating the fashion industry’s commitment to creating cruelty-free garments. As the largest city to ban the sale, trade and distribution of any fur or animal skin products, it’s fitting that L.A. is the latest city to host the event. The week marked the beginning of what is slated to become an annual industry staple, as hundreds of vegan lifestyle advocates, animal rights activists, designers and conscientious consumers gathered at the California Market Center. 
The 1.8 million-square-foot. complex in downtown L.A. was greeted by a crowd of excited visitors well before the show opened. Just outside the venue was a conveniently placed vegan food truck. At the far end of the lobby was the Black Carpet, where Instagram personalities, YouTubers and vegan activists chatted as onlookers snapped photos of (presumably vegan) influencers. 
When the doors finally opened, guests were greeted with bright lights, infusing the space with a lively and intimate ambiance. French pop music played on the loudspeaker and waiters handed out plant-based appetizers and desserts, catered from Cafe Gratitude. 
The show started with a performance by Naomi Greene, a contemporary singer and harpist. Soon after, models started strutting down the runway. Designers such as ENDA and WastedLA experimented with vegan leather peplum and appliquéd dresses, faux-shearling and faux-fur coats and puffer jackets made of recycled plastic to-go bags. A faux-leather appliquéd gown vibrantly displayed the recent trend of experimenting with mushrooms and other natural plants to create a leather-like effect. Each look was distinctive, sophisticated and chic.
More than just about protecting animals, VFW was about paying homage to them. Models walked out to that theme wearing gowns that resembled the enthralling, colorful feathers on peacocks and shimmering snake skin. 
Once the final models exited the stage, Los Angeles Vegan Fashion Week founder Emmanuelle Rienda took the stage. Since adopting a vegan lifestyle several years ago, the French stylist and animal rights activist has worked to push the vegan fashion movement forward. She gave an emotional speech thanking the designers for their efforts to make the fashion industry a more sustainable and animal-friendly place.
According to Rienda, the goal of the show was to create an environment that was much different than the sanctimonious vegan culture that is often portrayed in the media and the public. She was intent on making sure that Vegan Fashion Week was about being good to all things, animals, nature and humans included. To her, VFW is about empowering the next generations and inspiring the old to think about our planet and people. Rienda spearheaded a simultaneously conscious and stylish event, a significant step in furthering L.A.’s animal rights policies.

The voting period for the 2019 Undergraduate Student Government elections begins Tuesday. If this year is anything like last year, the number of students who cast their ballots will drop, continuing a long trend of dismal voter turnout. Over the last four years, more than 75 percent of the student body did not participate in USG elections, according to data from USG Senate.
Low student participation cannot continue to be the norm, especially when the agendas of USG candidates impact the well-being of all students. The University desperately needs positive, tangible change, and achieving this requires more students to vote.
It may be easy for students to use the classic excuse of being “too busy to vote,” especially at USC. The Schedule of Classes reports that “a normal academic load is 16 units per semester for undergraduate students,” and each unit generally requires at least two to three hours of study outside of class. In addition, most students invest countless hours into extracurriculars, internships and jobs, leaving little room for non-career pursuits, much less voting.
Voting, however, does not require much of a time investment. USG allows students to submit online ballots, eliminating the burden of travel time and other logistics of finding a polling place. While the research necessary for informed voting requires a heftier investment than a few clicks, the Daily Trojan publishes profiles for all senatorial and presidential candidates, and USG lists their platform points on their elections website, allowing for easier platform comparison.
Another common obstacle to voting is a general sense of USG’s powerlessness, which reflects a lack of trust in the efficacy of USG. Many students view USG as a weak and ineffective body of governance. It hardly helps that unless they are heavily involved in campus culture, most students do not see USG in action. As a result, they believe that the University’s functions are out of their hands and see voting as a burden.
While it is USG’s responsibility to raise awareness of the election and its implications on student life, students are responsible for educating themselves on USG policies and initiatives. In this year alone, USG was effective in passing several initiatives: It actively worked  with University administrators to institutionalize a Diversity Fund for students, updated emergency information on USCards, created new mindfulness curriculum and secured free digital New York Times subscriptions for all students. USG also issued statements condemning hate speech on campus and student exclusion from the Presidential Search Committee. These actions have been beneficial in raising awareness among students, faculty and administrators alike.
Ultimately, the perception of voting as a meaningless chore has implications well beyond the University. Voting in USG elections is fundamental because it prepares young people to engage with and participate in politics at all levels. 
Being civically engaged starts now. It is important that students are involved in decisions that affect them. If students don’t vote at the university level, they are less likely to vote in U.S. elections that already see low turnout among young adults.
In contrast, responding with indifference and cynicism traps USC students into a sense of learned helplessness, training them to be apathetic toward politics. Apathy is dangerous, especially at a University that seeks to train the next generation of leaders. However flawed a political process is, rejecting it only allows it to grow more dysfunctional.
The voting period ends on Thursday. Students can vote in person at booths located across campus, including next to Tommy Trojan and at USC Village. They can also vote online through USG’s elections page. Regardless of when or how you do it, please vote.

For the past few decades, the United States looks less like one nation and more like a divided one as it appears on our election maps: split along red and blue voting lines. It’s a dangerous state to be in. Our country’s two halves are further apart than ever, and the divide is still growing. 
But this division is nothing new. The bipartisan system is, by its very nature, a competition. Each party wants to control the government by itself, but the system is designed to prevent this from happening. The moment any ground is gained, it gets ripped right back to the center.
Another election cycle arrives, and all progress is swept away by changes in leadership. The opposing sides prevent an ideal United States from ever being realized. 
The political divide is a leash on our nation, holding it back from greatness. We are tempted to imagine what our country could accomplish if it were truly a united nation, if it were able to make its demands in a single, deafening voice. We could fix health care, improve the environment and refine the education system, all in a single election cycle. A state in harmony would be capable of achieving the highest of its aspirations, but we must consider which aspirations we choose to follow and, more importantly, if our choice would be the right one. 
But the very notion that there is a correct choice — that there exists an ideal set of policies to fix the nation — is misleading. A profit-driven approach benefits the economy at the cost of environmental protections or labor union interests. Conversely, regulations that protect the environment and the laborer unavoidably put a check on economic growth. Policies are double-, triple-, quadruple-edged, and it’s often impossible to tell whether a policy has helped more than it has harmed. 
Too often, we assume that the idea we prefer is the right one, but in a country so massively diverse as ours, there is no such thing as a “right” policy. Most of the time, we settle for the ones that might make just a fraction of an improvement and  won’t be batted down by Congress. We settle for possible and, to this aim, unanimity is fatal. Research shows that the problem-solving ability of a group is crippled when it lacks internal conflict. Scrutiny tempers ideas — it forces us to come up with better solutions. A group divided is capable of achieving far more than one that stands in solidarity. 
Still, too much disagreement can’t be good for the nation, and our divide is growing at a steady rate. Not every topic has a compromise: disagreements on gun control and immigration seem insoluble; our deep-rooted ideologies make communication impossible, let alone convergence. 
We must stop thinking of our divide as something that needs to be bridged. Talk of growing division conjures the image of a fractured America, but it also gives us the wrong idea of what our aim should be: not to unify our opinions but to better understand why they differ.
Policies can’t be written off as wrong, as simple as it would be to do so. Consider the positions you find unthinkable — morally reckless, even — and consider the reasons they inspire such strong support. Stances on closed-immigration policy and gun rights are designed to safeguard the country and its liberties. Whether they could achieve this is up for debate, but they still deserve the chance to try. Beyond that, they deserve the consideration of the entire country. The moment that we recognize the opposition’s validity is the moment that our divide becomes a workable tool of politics, rather than the obstacle that it’s begun to resemble. 
Our country seems to sit at  crossroads every day, and it seems we choose the wrong path more often than the right one. With so much at stake, it’s difficult to accept that you can only have one hand on the steering wheel and sometimes not even get that. The important thing is to have the right vision of progress, to understand that it isn’t in gaining more control, but in learning how to better share the country — even if that means letting go of the wheel.

Student Health Services hired a Relationship and Sexual Violence Prevention specialist, who will arrive in late February to create a curriculum for students on affirmative consent, bystander awareness and other topics related to sexual violence and assault. 
USC is working toward fostering a culture of consent by boosting sexual assault prevention techniques and education on campus. This is one of the goals in its 2017-2020 Strategic Plan. 
RSVP Services is the immediate provider for students who have been victims of sexual assault, harassment or relationship violence. 
“What we want to be able to do with the prevention specialist is [to] add capacity in this area and also to have someone who is really focusing their entire position on really looking at prevention,” Chief Health Officer Sarah Van Orman said. 
A 2015 survey by the Association of American Universities found that 66 percent of undergraduate females and 45 percent of undergraduate males at USC reported being the victims of sexual harassment. It was also found that an estimated 25 percent of students  knew the resources available to them when reporting an assault. 
“I think, for RSVP, what I wanted to do was raise our visibility on campus as a resource for both supportive services and advocacy, as well as prevention,” RSVP director Brenda Ingram said. “We haven’t had as strong as a voice on campus as we would like.”  
In 2014, USC launched an online module required for incoming students, titled “Think About It.”  The one-hour online course encourages students to participate in critical thinking about consent, relationships, sexual assault, bystander intervention and University resources by producing  multiple online scenarios for students. 
While USC plans to keep the online module, it is looking to implement in-person training for incoming students that will continue throughout their time in college. 
“[We] are in the process of developing what we are calling multiple doses of consent and healthy relationships and sexual assault prevention education,” said Diane Medsker, a senior learning and training specialist at the Office for Health Promotion Strategy. 
Incoming freshmen will participate in the interactive workshop on campus in the upcoming semesters. 
The University will pilot a workshop this fall titled “Affirmative Consent” that will teach students about current California consent laws. While the pilot program won’t be made mandatory for students, Ingram hopes to require it in addition to “Think About It” in upcoming years. 
USC also hopes to increase bystander awareness and education by working with the organization Bringing in the Bystander. To start, 40 teachers and students will be trained on how to safely intervene in instances of sexual assault and relationship violence or situations such as stalking. Once trained, these students and teachers are certified to train other members on campus. 
“It’s so easy to go into shock [as a bystander] and not be able to acknowledge what is happening right in front of you,” said Lizzie Keller, a sophomore majoring in cinema and media studies who uses RSVP services. “I think putting people in that mindset of being careful and paying attention to your surroundings would be really helpful.” 
The Association of American Universities will conduct its study on sexual assault and sexual misconduct again in April 2019. Students at USC and 26 other universities will receive information to participate via email.  
“I really encourage everybody to … take the survey,” Van Orman said. “The information is really valuable and will really shape what we do on our campus.”

About a month into her full-time position as vice president of USC’s Office of Ethics and Compliance, Stacy Giwa said she is on a long-term journey to uphold the values of the USC community.
Giwa joined the office in November, but said that she began her full-time position at the beginning of January. According to Giwa, the Office has three primary responsibilities: overseeing the University for overall compliance, ensuring ethical decision-making and implementing overarching culture initiatives. 
In addition to serving as vice president of the Office, Giwa is also a supporting member of the President’s Culture Commission. Interim President Wanda Austin announced the commission members last November and said it “will oversee [USC’s] efforts to improve campus culture.” 
“We will … undertake a process where we engage with [students, faculty and staff] … to open a dialogue to revisit University values,” Giwa said. 
Giwa said that she has been able to engage with the campus community more directly since working full-time in her position. 
“It’s been nice for me to have the additional time here at the University with the different stakeholder groups,” Giwa said. 
According to USC News, Giwa trained as a lawyer and began her career in labor and employment litigation. One of her first tasks at USC is updating the Code of Ethics, which was last updated in 2014. Part of the redrafting process will involve a survey from the Barrett Values Centre, which helps measure the culture of workplace environments. 
Giwa said that before the survey is sent out, USC officials will sit down with the Barrett Values Centre to form an “engagement plan” to prepare for responses from the USC Community.
“The survey is just a tool to enable further discussions and engagement [about the University’s values],” Giwa said. “When we do ask people to engage in a survey, we can also commit to them that we have an engagement plan to follow up on what we hear … and get more feedback on the survey results themselves.” 
Giwa stressed the importance of her office incorporating the values of University stakeholders. She said her role will provide structure for students, faculty and staff to have discussions about USC’s values and ethics. 
“What I’m most excited about is helping the University be able to move forward with starting these conversations,” Giwa said. “I’m very excited for students to have some avenues to bring their perspective forward.”

Student leaders in the Price School of Public Policy penned a letter on Jan. 24 supporting the changes Board of Trustees Chairman Rick Caruso and Interim President Wanda Austin made in their effort to increase accountability and transparency at USC. The Daily Trojan obtained the letter on Saturday.
The letter was a response to trustees Ming Hsieh and Ed Roski’s public letters criticizing Caruso’s handling of a meeting in December during which board members voted to support Austin’s decision to terminate Marshall School of Business Dean James Ellis. 
The Price Student Organization Coalition, which has representatives from organizations including the Associated Students of Planning and Development, Price Latino Student Association, Graduate Policy Administration Community, Queer Policy Caucus, Students of Color and Allies Policy Forum, Price Social Innovation and Asian Pacific Islander Caucus signed the letter, lauding Caruso’s and Austin’s actions.
“The course set by Chair Caruso and Interim President Austin has shown a new level of transparency, integrity and responsiveness to student, staff and faculty desires that not only reflects the on-campus climate but is also working to repair a badly damaged reputation for our school,” the letter read. “The reported actions of trustees Roski and Hsieh actively work against those steps forward.” 
The students wrote that they decided to vote for a show of confidence, regardless of the public  struggles among Caruso, Austin and some trustees. 
“As student leaders, we want to drive home that the appearance of this situation presents publicly as a struggle between pursuing a bold, new agenda and maintaining a morally compromised status quo,” the letter read. 
Alex Freedman, a graduate student at Price, said he and other members of the Price Student Organization Coalition wrote the letter to voice their support for Austin’s decision to fire Ellis. He said that ever since Austin began to serve as the University’s interim president, he feels more engaged with and aware of University decisions. 
“We wrote this letter because we wanted to send a message that we’re paying attention now more than ever, and we like the direction that things have been going as far as moving to make changes and progress,” Freedman said. “We want to make sure that momentum continues to grow rather than stall or turn around.” 
Freedman said Hsieh and Roski’s letters denouncing Caruso show they are in favor of the “status quo” of former President C. L. Max Nikias’ administration. He said Nikias covered up a number of controversies, including former campus gynecologist George Tyndall’s alleged abuse of hundreds of women. 
“Anyone who is making statements publicly in favor of that administration over steps toward reconciling with that and facing it head on as messy or as potentially damaging as it could be in the short term is also sending signals that student welfare doesn’t matter,” Freedman said. 
Graduate student Edmundo Diaz Jr., a coalition member who signed the letter, said he and other students wanted to show Caruso and Austin they have support as they try to change the University’s culture. 
“We’re always critical, we always want USC to be the best and we [always] hold them accountable, just as anyone would do for any organization,” Diaz said. “We wanted to show a vote of confidence for Chairman Caruso and Dr. Austin. It is a very tough time for USC. They’re trying to rebuild their reputation, but we really just believe in what they’re doing.” 
However, Hsieh said Caruso and Austin’s actions are harmful to Marshall and disagrees with the changes that have been made. 
“Maybe, the interim president or Caruso was more ‘transparent’ to students at the School of Public Policy and did not inform me as a trustee, or [the] Marshall School’s [faculty], students, alumni and donors why Dean Jim Ellis [was] removed,” Hsieh said in an email to the Daily Trojan. 
The University and the Price School of Public Policy declined to comment. Ed Roski did not respond to request for comment by the time of publication.
