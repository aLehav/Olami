Thirty-one percent of Los Angeles City registered voters are likely to vote for mayoral candidate and former chair of the USC Board of Trustees Rick Caruso in the upcoming Nov. 8 election, who follows behind Rep. Karen Bass by just three percentage points, according to a late September poll by UC Berkeley’s Institute of Governmental Studies. 
The closing gap between the candidates’ likelihoods comes amid major recent endorsements for Bass, a 2015 graduate of the Peck School of Social Work. Vermont Sen. and 2020 presidential candidate Bernie Sanders announced his endorsement in an Oct. 4 statement, citing Bass’s plans to “end homelessness, make housing more affordable, create good paying jobs, lower the crime rate and build a diverse coalition.” 
Sanders’ endorsement follows California Sen. Dianne Feinstein’s Sept. 28 endorsement of Bass, whose endorsement alongside her counterpart Alex Padilla’s means both California senators back Bass over Caruso. Feinstein described L.A. native Bass as “the type of leader who will work tirelessly to improve the lives of Angelenos” and who will “give 100% to serve the city in which she was born.”
The day before Feinstein’s announcement, the United Firefighters of L.A. City officially endorsed Caruso in a vote of more than 100 union members.
“We congratulate Rick Caruso for presenting a vision for the future of Los Angeles that earned him this endorsement,” their Sept. 27 bulletin stated. “We look forward to working with him in the weeks to come leading up to the November 8 election, and we believe that he can provide the leadership that the City of Los Angeles desperately needs.”
Director for the USC Center for the Political Future Bob Shrum said that Caruso’s campaign argues that “it’s time to try someone who’s not a professional politician.” 
Shrum said that though recent polls show “a much closer race among all voters,” there is a 15-point gap in favor of Bass among what the polls define as likely voters, as the L.A. Times reported on Oct. 2. Shrum, however, is careful not to call the election yet.
“If you had to bet money right now … you would probably bet on Bass,” Shrum said. “But I don’t think the race is over by any means. And I think we’ll see an awful lot of television [ads], and I suspect a lot of mailers and a lot of canvassing over the next five or six weeks.” 
Shrum added that Caruso, who has spent over $62 million compared to Bass’s $6 million according to the L.A. City Ethics Commission, has “a huge financial advantage.” 
“We can anticipate that there will be a pretty substantial number of negative ads coming from the Caruso campaign, and there will be some coming from the Bass campaign,” Shrum said. 
Caruso’s critics have cited his failure to donate the one million dollars he pledged May 3 toward the passage of Proposition 1, a proposed amendment to codify abortion rights into the California state constitution.
“His words are, yes, certainly advocating for Democrat policies, but his money and his past actions have shown a different story,” said Sara Stienecker, a sophomore majoring in political science who also serves as the political director for the Trojan Democrats. 
The Trojan Democrats endorsed Bass on Mar. 1, which Stienecker said was largely in part because of “the failure that Caruso had to address sexual violence at USC.” The organization also reiterated the significance to them of Caruso’s previous Republican affiliation. 
“He hasn’t been a lifelong Democrat, he hasn’t had the values that our organization prioritizes,” Stienecker said. “It’s really important to our organization that we have a true Democrat as L.A. mayor that supports our values and will protect everyone.”

After USC became party to a landmark deal with the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power last Wednesday, USC is receiving 25% of its energy from solar-generated power and promoting the advancement of solar programs within the surrounding community. 
Set in motion over three years ago, the 20-year agreement will provide the University with up to 25 megawatts of power per day from the LADWP SpringBok 3 Solar Farm in the Mojave Desert — nearly 30% of the farm’s yearly output. Power from the farm is being directed toward both the University Park Campus and the Health Sciences Campus. However, various attachments of Keck Medicine will not be receiving the power.
Overall USC emissions are expected to reduce by approximately 20%, placing the University on the cusp of climate neutrality for direct and indirect emissions by 2025.
USC’s Chief Sustainability Officer Mick Dalrymple said in an interview with the Daily Trojan that the deal is “a huge step forward for actually walking the talk on clean energy for everybody.”
“We’re actually contributing to LADWP, setting money aside to help neighbors around USC to get into solar either through community solar projects, or they’re buying into solar or receiving solar from an off-site project,” Dalrymple said.
USC is the first major institution to partner with the LADWP Clean Energy Adder program, according to Zelinda Welch, an associate director of sustainability at USC facilities planning and management. The program aims to make renewable energy sources increasingly available to underserved multifamily complexes.
“For every kilowatt hour we purchase, we also give a certain amount of money to these different programs that are run by the LADWP to help better access to solar and clean energy for the local communities,” Welch said. 
The University’s contributions toward the community energy programs are expected to reach $180,000 annually and will be split between the Shared Solar Energy program, which allows renters to offset a portion of energy usage with solar, and the Virtual Net Energy Metering program, which encourages solar development in multifamily complexes.
“It’s basically almost like a donation, but it’s part of our rate agreement — we pay for the electricity out of the solar plant and then we also pay an additional adder that then goes into these different programs that LADWP runs,” Welch said. “Helping fund these programs and support these programs is one of the larger commitments we’ve made.”
The deal will help contribute to the diversity, equity and inclusion goals outlined in Assignment: Earth, the University’s environmental framework through the 2028 L.A. summer Olympic games. The framework includes goals for USC to reach full carbon neutrality by 2025 and zero waste by 2028. 
The University will see a marginal increase in its electricity bill — less than 1% — to cover the rate change for the electricity and renewable energy credits, and funding provided to city Clean Energy Adder programs.
Solar energy has been a staple of the USC energy portfolio for several years now, with installations at the Cardinal and Gold apartment building and Wrigley Science Center on Catalina Island producing 20% of each facility’s needs. The solar panels atop the Galen Center provide upwards of 15% of the building’s expenditures, 600 kW, on any given day.
USC joins Stanford University, University of Arizona, Arizona State University, American University, the UC system and George Washington University in the high-grade integration of solar energy projects in their holdings.

An intimate atmosphere and jaw-dropping performances by everyone involved made the Arlo Parks concert Sunday night at The Fonda Theatre a fantastic experience. The show was a part of the British artist’s “Collapsed in Sunbeams” North American tour. 
The Fonda Theatre’s smaller size created an intimate feel that suited her slower, more stripped-down songs. Even with a sold-out concert, Parks managed to forge a personal connection between herself and the audience. 
The concert began at 9:00 p.m sharp. The opening act, Puma Blue, did a 40-minute set with Cameron Dawson on bass, Ellis Dupuy on drums and Harvey Grant playing the saxophone. Their jazzy alternative R&B set quickly won the audience over. When they went all out, the sound felt like it should have overloaded the senses but instead was a euphony of music. 
Twenty minutes after Puma Blue’s set, “Green Eyes” started playing. The curtains went up to reveal Parks’ band performing without her. After a minute, to deafening cheers and screams, Parks arrived on stage, green lighting accentuating her red-dyed hair as she began to sing with live vocals that sounded identical to her studio music. Her insane vocal performance persisted for the entire hour-long set. At the end of “Green Eyes,” an audience member gave Parks flowers that she placed by the drums for the rest of the set. Her attentiveness to her audience allowed every attendee to feel a connection to her. 
Parks entered immediately into “Portra 400,” and the lighting shifted from green to purple. The trumpet came in strong during the outro which electrified the performance and brought the song to a completely different level. 
Following “Portra 400,” Parks told the audience to respect each other’s space at Arlo’s house. At the same time, she wanted to see wild, gyrating hips and for people to go feral for the next song: “Caroline.” The crowd obliged, as the chorus of “Caroline” produced the loudest cheers of the night as the audience serenaded Parks while she held the mic out encouraging them to get as loud as possible. 
“Bluish” marked the end of the first part of her set. The brass section left the stage as Parks pivoted towards a more chill vibe with “Eugene.” Parks dedicated the song to all the bisexuals in the building, which produced some hollering from the crowd. The crowd screamed the lyrics back to Parks in harmony, “Read him Sylvia Plath, I thought that was our thing.” 
Next, she introduced “Angel’s Song,” a song she wrote at 16 years old which she said was inspired by Sufjan Stevens, Elliott Smith and Joni Mitchell. Their influence was obvious, and her performance felt different from the rest of the show; it was just her and the guitarist with a spotlight on them. The crowd responded in kind, replacing their dancing with swaying as the emotion felt by the audience was palpable.
Before she performed “Black Dog,” which she called one of the most important songs she’s ever written, Parks led the crowd in a call-and-repeat of her mantra that she says to herself before every show, “I am lucky, I am loved, I am brave, I am in control.” The crowd happily obliged, and this moment bonded all the strangers in the crowd. The bassist and drummer came back with their instruments and Parks got almost too into it during a jam at the song’s end, where she tripped and fell while dancing, but she laughed it off.
“Sophie” brought the crowd together as they did an arm wave for the entire song, joining as one to make a very special moment. The song finished with a minute-long guitar solo that had the crowd fired up. Parks thanked the crowd for being loose and shaking their hips before going into “Hope.” She immediately left the stage at the song’s end, followed by her band.
The crowd chanted for an encore, and just a minute later, the band returned followed by Parks to riotous applause. Before starting “Softly,” she thanked the crowd again for coming to the show and enjoying her music. “Softly” caused the biggest reaction. Although there were songs where the crowd sang louder, this was the song where the attendees got the most hype, jumping around without a care in the world. She thanked them one last time before leaving the stage, leaving her band to jam out one final time.

The School of Dramatic Arts brought a slice of Nigeria and an air of Shakespeare to the Bing Theater stage with their production of “Wedlock of the Gods” last weekend. Though the set design and production created an immersive experience, the writing left the audience wanting more. 
The story, written by Nigeria’s first published female playwright Zulu Sofola, is a tragic yet classic tale about the struggle and pursuit of agency in one’s life against the desires and expectations of others. The play is centred around a forbidden love between main characters Uloko (Shyhiem Parker) and Ogwoma (Summer Young), with undercurrents of feminism, independence and rebellion through a lens most are unfamiliar with.
Touching on different types of love — romantic, platonic, familial — the play confronts the uncomfortable truth that, despite one’s intentions, actions forged out of love can have harmful and at times fatal consequences. These themes, set in 19th century Nigeria, emphasize how the struggles of the human condition are universal, irrespective of time, place or culture.
Before the performance began, the audience was brought into the world by an incredibly authentic set: tribal art coated the walls and thatch coverings and traditional African vases and furniture were dispersed throughout the stage. A live onstage band tied it all together, introducing the world and transitioning between scenes with African instruments such as shakers, flutes, drums and other percussion. 
Though the set was incredible, the tech department was criminally underutilized, except for a short, yet immersive, sequence of otherworldly light display, accompanied by a distorted arrangement of nature sounds mixed with the African melodies while performers in haunting costumes advanced through the crowd, demonstrating the mystical aspects of the story. The moment forced the audience to suspend their disbelief and truly be enveloped in this uneasy scene; it’s a shame those techniques weren’t used more throughout the performance.
Once the play began, the audience was immediately captivated by the powerful presence of the main antagonist, Odibei (Dara Adedara), mother to the deceased husband of Ogwoma. Though off to a strong start, the subsequent performer’s attempts to do a Nigerian accent were met with varying degrees of success and consistency. While most were passable, it was evident a few performers were held back in their attempts to act in a voice not their own. Despite this, there were quite a few stand-out performances.
The scene focusing on the family of the main love interest, Uloko, was particularly noteworthy. Udo (John Stephens) had such a command over both the material and the room itself that every word he said pulled the audience in more. He demanded attention from the moment he stepped on stage. The audience was treated to an earnest and sincere interaction between surrogate father and son, balancing anger and disagreement with unwavering love and protection.
Immediately following that, the interaction between Uloko’s mother, Ogoli (Jordan Cooper), and himself had an emotional depth that contextualized the entire piece. Though their scene does not particularly thrust the plot forward, their interaction made the audience understand the dynamic of the people they are surrounded by and the society in which they reside. The scene demonstrates not only the weight of expectation from those in the village, but also how much of a burden the past can be, how it affects the present and how difficult it is to communicate that to those we love. Their poignant back-and-forth beautifully conveyed that, however well-meaning, the love of a family member can often feel like pressure and pain.
Unfortunately, that is almost the only scene where the characters’ dynamics and relationships were explored in such depth. It leaves the audience without much insight or understanding of the other characters. Before the complexity of the characters was understood or much action had taken place, the story was over. The confusion amongst the audience was tangible as the performance came to a close. Murmurs of “Is it over?” and “Was that it?” echoed across the crowd. It felt too concise. Without an intermission, space for the action to really take effect or a chance for the audience to truly connect with the characters, it was finished, making the end feel a bit hollow, with the emotional beats falling slightly flat, despite noble efforts from the performers.
Once the production was done, an initial criticism which came to mind is the seemingly poor categorization of this story as a feminist one. The main female protagonist, Ogwoma, has noticeably less stage time than her male counterpart, and seemingly not as much emotional depth. Most of her grandiose rebellious acts happen before the play ever begins and her search for agency and the pursuit of rebellion is ultimately met with an unpleasant end. It is difficult to reconcile the usage of the same word to describe this piece as we do with the #girlboss and female-centered stories we are used to seeing.
This comparison, however, is an unnecessary one to make. This piece was not only written but also set well before the state of modern feminism and representation we know today. A woman in 19th century Nigeria defying expectations with steadfast self-assurance and agency in her life is a powerful narrative in itself. The intersection of race, culture and gender is specific to the time and thus adequately proportional to the radicalistic feminism we know today without the need to be as overt as modern portrayals.
The clear and universal themes shown throughout this production are refreshing to see through such a typically unconventional lens. Perhaps that desire for more once it ended is evidence of the quality of what the audience did receive. Despite its imperfections, it was quite an enjoyable way to spend an afternoon, reveling in themes we can all relate to: the pursuit of agency and love.

Coperni debuted its Spring-Summer 2023 collection during Paris Fashion Week, and it was nothing short of spectacular. I anticipated what their show-stopping piece would be this year; they had already gone viral for their glass bubble/horned bags and the denim jean boots, but this year was their most evocative, powerful and daring yet. 
The final look of the show was more of a performance than anything else. It girl Bella Hadid steps out in nothing but a thong, and she stands in all of her beauty as they sprayed the white dress onto her. Yes — I said sprayed. The spray slowly clung to her body, and before Hadid took her walk around the runway, the designers cut a slit and twisted the sleeves to fall off of her shoulders, taking “custom made” to a whole new level. The way the white dress molded off of Hadid was reminiscent of greek statues seen in museums and all over Pinterest. 
Many people immediately compared it to Alexander McQueen’s SS99 collection, where his final look was a model spinning as her dress got sprayed by robots. I, too, immediately saw this connection and thought Coperni’s was a more modern take on McQueen’s version – until I saw TikTok user Taylor Wang’s (@taylorwjc) video. 
There, Wang explains how Coperni made a splash, but it doesn’t get to count as history since there was nothing else backing up the collection: it simply was just a fantastic and surprising ending to Coperni’s show. But what thought was put behind it? What message was it trying to send? If it’s the same old “technology is coming” message, should that even count as something new? 
Before I get more into my thoughts, I think discussing what makes something historic is important. Most often, for an event to be historic, there has to be something that is new, out of the ordinary and imperative to the understanding of something — things like wars or cultural revolutions. As a result, the historic things get noted, remembered and studied by those in the future years and incorporated into curriculums or studies. 
However, with the age of social media, everything, whether historic or not, is well documented because a digital footprint exists. Everything, and I mean everything, can be found eventually, including archive collections and footage of McQueen’s robotic painted dress. 
The internet is obsessed with 90s Chanel, but it’s not historic, it’s simply an aesthetic that the current generation has grown fond of and obsessed with — also because of who was wearing the garments — i.e. Cindy Crawford and Naomi Campbell of the supermodel era.
But, if we refer back to the TikTok, for something to be historical, does it have to have an immense background of deep and profound meaning? Personally, I disagree. 
Going back to 90s Chanel, the collection is still immensely popular for mood boards and outfit inspiration, partially because the combination of pastel tweed and jewelry is such an aesthetic, and partially because the collection happened in the supermodel era. But it is historic because of what the collection has become, not historic in its time and at the moment of its debut. 
Still, when an industry emphasizes creating or revitalizing something new, then I believe it does earn the chance to count as history. Coperni revitalized the blend of technology and fashion past 3D printing like threeASFOUR and McQueen’s robots, but, as some media outlets haven’t yet discovered, Coperni also revived the spray-on fabric itself. 
It was actually first invented by particle enginer Paul Luckham and designer Dr. Manel Torres (who sprayed it on to Hadid) in 2010. They created it so that the spray could be easily layered and transformed into a clingy fabric that could be washed but could also serve in the medical field as a sterilized spray to help wounds heal. 
And, while I’m happy they have given Dr. Torres the chance to spotlight his creation, what about Luckham? As I do believe that the Coperni moment will go down in history because of how iconic the moment was with such a cultural icon like Hadid, is this another case of who gets the credit for this event coming to surface? Will it be Dr. Torres and Luckham who actually invented it, or Coperni, the bigger dog, who marketed it in an efficient and incredible way?
I believe in an ideal world that both will get credit, with more emphasis on the former, but if anything, at least this article will be one more voice advocating for the underdogs. And, until then, live, love, Coperni.

This article contains mentions of sexual misconduct and harassment.
Since August 2020, there has existed a required reality for victims of sexual misconduct that have filed a Title IX violation case against their abuser — they must undergo a live, recorded hearing to describe what happened to them.
This requirement was one part of Trump administration-implemented guidelines on the landmark civil rights legislation that many have claimed weakened students’ willingness to report misconduct complaints. Yet, following the recent 50th anniversary of the landmark civil rights legislation, the Biden administration has proposed new changes to the law aimed at providing more clear rules to help schools combat sex discrimination and “restore vital protections for students in our nation’s schools which were eroded by controversial regulations implemented during the previous Administration,” including on the live hearing process.
These changes include reversing narrow wording in the regulations implemented by the Department of Education under Trump’s administration, like on the definition of sexual harassment: In 2020, the administration’s new regulations defined it as “any unwelcome conduct that a reasonable person would find so severe, pervasive and objectively offensive that it denies a person equal educational access” — wording that legally excepted instances of stalking, domestic violence, dating violence or sexual assault. 
“I just think about how I would feel if the worst thing that happened to me was recorded … [and] I had to sit with the people that may have been responsible for the event, and that was the only way to tell the story, as opposed to having some privacy,” said Lavonna Blair Lewis, associate dean of Diversity, Equity and Inclusion and teaching professor at the Sol Price School of Public Policy.
When Lewis was asked about whether the proposed regulations help to move the live hearing process in a better direction, she said that the possibility was there.
“For me, the big issue has to be, ‘Are we doing what we can such that we can get people to honestly share what’s happened to them without having to be retraumatized to do that?’” she said. “That is what I would hope would happen, that people feel like talking about what’s happened to them, [in a way that] doesn’t put a target on their back.”
Another crucial change in the Department of Education’s guidelines is the expansion of Title IX guidelines to include discrimination on the basis of gender identity or sexual orientation, aimed at clarifying protections for the LGBTQIA student population in both the academic, activity and athletic educational environment. 
Students, including Navya Singh, a junior majoring in business administration and member of the club water polo team, lauded the expansion of the Title IX protections and noted that the civil rights law is often in the back of her mind as she plays and interacts with her teammates.
“It makes me feel like I have more trust in the American administration and leadership,” Singh said. “I feel like this is a great step forward, especially for people who identify with specific [social] groups.”
Yet not all within the USC community view the proposed changes to Title IX through a positive lens. In an earlier interview with the Daily Trojan July 22 regarding Title IX, former USC athletics administrator Barbara Hedges cited a Wall Street Journal op-ed titled “Biden’s Title IX Rewrite is an Assault on Women’s Rights” that had alerted her to the administration’s proposals. This article describes the Department of Education’s proposed amendments as an “illegal rewrite” of federal law that will “erase women and undermine constitutional liberties” — including a portion that provides sharp criticism into the inclusion of transgender women into female athletic teams and spaces.
Hedges said she wants to “understand the thinking” behind the proposed legislation.
“I need to do my own research … Why they need to overhaul [or even think about] Title IX is beyond me,” said Hedges in July, on being “alarmed” by her discovery of the changes. “It’s something that could have a very negative effect on opportunities for women, particularly in athletics.”
Hedges also raised a concern, as mentioned in the WSJ op-ed, about the power of government agencies to “rewrite legislation that had been passed and signed by the President.” Yet, many checks and balances exist to prevent bureaucratic agencies from producing guidelines that are unconstitutional.
This includes a mandatory 60-day public comment period, in which any member of the public can submit feedback, data, arguments or views to a government agency when they publish new proposals in the Federal Register — the government’s daily journal that is available to the public. All relevant matters and comments about new regulations must be responded to by the agency in some form. Additionally, the Administrative Procedures Act of 1946 provides the federal court system with standards for judicial review if an agency action provides adverse effects or is unconstitutional.
In her interview with the Daily Trojan, Lewis encouraged students and any individual with an opinion on an agency’s regulations to submit their comments on proposed laws and to start with government sources first when it comes to policy opinions.
“My philosophy is always, ‘I can’t complain about it if I didn’t try to do something about it,’” Lewis said. “It’s easy to throw stones after the fact, but one has to ask themselves, when I was given the opportunity, did I try to get something different?”

Returning home after USC’s two games in Oregon, soccer  looks to dominate the pitch against the University of Arizona Thursday. With two away game victories in Oregon, the Trojans have extended their winning streak to four games. The team, which started the season off strong with 3 straight conference wins, has continuously exceeded expectations and capitalized on game-winning moments. 
The away series in Oregon further proved the team as a force to be reckoned with. USC played Oregon State last Thursday. With relentless goal scoring, the Trojans earned a 5-1 win. Sophomore midfielder Simi Awujo was first on the scoreboard with a goal in the 21st minute. 
This success was repeated three days later on Sunday against the University of Oregon, where USC shut out the Ducks 4-0.
“The team really has momentum,” said Head Coach Jane Alukonis. “I think we are in good form in terms of being able to manage the load on players and rotate as we need.” 
Senior midfielder Croix Bethune is a player to watch in the upcoming matchup, as she has scored 5 goals and added 7 assists this season. Bethune is undoubtedly heating up, scoring 3 goals and notching 3 assists in the previous two games. 
“[Bethune] scans the field and finds areas where she can be effective,” said Alukonis. “She’s just different. She just always finds pockets, spaces and ways to create super nicely.” 
Her immense contributions to the team’s past two wins has earned her the title of Pac-12 Offensive Player of the Week. 
Sophomore forward Simone Jackson has also been a key player in the Trojans’ attack. With 4 goals and 2 assists, Jackson has consistently helped the team gain momentum throughout the season. 
With 3 goals and 1 assist, sophomore midfielder Aaliyah Farmer has proven to be a crucial player in the Trojan lineup. Farmer is coming off of an impressive performance against University of Oregon with 1 goal and 1 assist.
Now with a notable 7-1-1 record overall and a 3-0-0 conference record, USC finds themselves at the top of the Pac-12 standings, tied only with their crosstown rivals. 
Stepping into Thursday’s matchup, Arizona is seeking a much-needed win after losing their past three games against Utah, Stanford and UC Berkeley . The Wildcats have not scored a goal since Sept. 23 at Ute Field, which was earned by sophomore midfielder Gianna Christiansen.
For Arizona, playing USC will be the first of their two Los Angeles matchups as the team faces UCLA on Sunday, Oct. 9. The Wildcats are currently ranked 12th in the Pac-12 standings and have a chance to knock off the two top teams in the conference. Freshman midfielder Sami Baytosh, is a player to watch on Thursday as she leads the team in goals and assists, earning two of each so far this season.
Looking ahead to Thursday’s game, Alukonis said she feels “really good going into the week, and the team is absolutely full of talent as long as we turn up and work hard. I’m always super confident with this group.”
The Trojans will face the Wildcats at 3:30 p.m. on Thursday, Oct. 6, at Soni McAlister Field.

The postseason bracket is set in stone, and the time for madness is now. Let’s examine every playoff squad and determine how and why  anyone can win it all.
The Los Angeles Dodgers were Major League Baseball’s first 110-game winner since the 2001 Seattle Mariners, and for good reason. The offseason acquisition of first baseman Freddie Freeman seemed to have worked out so far. This year, he posted the league’s fifth-highest Fangraphs Wins Above Replacement at 6.9, and barely lost the National League batting title to the New York Mets’ Jeff McNeil. Dodgers right fielder Mookie Betts and shortstop Trea Turner were their regular MVP-contender selves once again, and midseason pickup Trayce Thompson has been a monster off the bench. Most unfairly, literally every pitcher in their starting rotation produced a sub-3 ERA. The only weakness I see in their game is the inconsistency of closer Craig Kimbrel, who posted seven losses and five blown saves this season, with those struggles becoming more obvious as of late. Unfortunately for the Dodgers, they may need to rely on blowing out their opponents this postseason in order to avoid piling the shaky Kimbrel with a heavy workload. I’m sure it won’t be too hard for them.
The Houston Astros are hilariously, outrageously good. They posted a 100-win year for the fourth time in the last five full seasons — for good reason. Yordan Alvarez is a demon with a bat in his hands, and surely cemented himself as a top-three hitter in the Major Leagues. Second baseman Jose Altuve and third baseman Alex Bregman returned to heights not seen since 2019, and rookie Jeremy Pena made up for the loss of shortstop Carlos Correa by posting a ROY-contending 3.4 fWAR campaign. Justin Verlander spat in the face of Father Time and pitched to the tune of a 1.75 ERA, while first-time All-Star Framber Valdez was the definition of consistency. Last season’s AL batting champion Yuli Gurriel was a bit of a dud, but no matter. Houston should be an absolute wrecking crew this postseason, and will ride Verlander and Valdez in their first round matchup against either Seattle or Toronto. They are my pick to come out of the American League.
The New York Yankees’ “collapse” was dramatically overhyped, but I can’t lie and say it wouldn’t have been priceless to see. Alas, collapse they did not, and New York grabbed the #2 seed in the American League, with MVP frontrunner (and AL single season home run record holder) Aaron Judge producing one of the greatest seasons in league history. First baseman Anthony Rizzo and outfielder Giancarlo Stanton will be fully healthy entering the postseason, and along with Judge, should be enough to compensate for the rest of the squad’s rather lackluster offense. Nestor Cortes replaced Gerrit Cole as the ace of the pitching staff, and looked as nasty as Cole’s $324 million contract this season. However, the bullpen is full of holes, with Aroldis Chapman looking worse than ever. 
Oh boy, here comes Atlanta. The Braves posted a 77-33 record from June 1 on, and overtook the Mets as the top dog in the NL East and the #2 seed in the National League. Rookies Spencer Strider and Michael Harris II burst onto the scene, and should finish 1-2 in the ROY race. Infielders Austin Riley, Matt Olson, and Dansby Swanson provided plenty of firepower, but their real ace in the hole is the pitching staff. Strider, Max Fried and Kyle Wright are a three-headed monster any team will be terrified to face in a five-game series. Just like last year, I expect them to grab the pennant in their pursuit of back-to-back titles.
The Cleveland Guardians were the biggest surprise in MLB this year, and managed to grab the AL Central title for the first time since 2018. Rookie Steven Kwan was electric, and breakout All-Star Andres Gimenez might be the best second baseman in the league come next season. They should be a problem for Tampa Bay, who, despite Cy Young award contender Shane McLanahan, does not sport enough offensive firepower to overcome Cleveland. I’ll take Cleveland in two.
The Mariners marched their way to the playoffs for the first time since 2001, and they can thank rookie sensation Julio Rodriguez for his help along the way. Their bullpen propelled the M’s pitching staff to one of the best in the league, and will face quite the formidable offense in their wild card matchup versus Toronto. However, I expect Seattle to calm the red-hot bat of Bo Bichette and silence the Blue Jays in three games.
The St. Louis Cardinals and their trio of old-timers continued the level of dominance almost expected from the franchise at this point and grabbed the NL Central title over Milwaukee. Third baseman Nolan Arenado and first baseman Paul Goldschmidt will finish near the top in MVP voting and can squash the Phillies’ hopes in their first round matchup. If only catcher J.T. Realmuto could play all nine defensive positions. St. Louis in three.
The Mets won 100 games this year and still have to play in the Wild Card round. At least there was one New York collapse. The big bats of Dan Vogelbach and Pete Alonso were not enough to salvage the NL East title following a flurry of pitching injuries. Unfortunately for Juan Soto and the Padres, Max Scherzer and Jacob DeGrom are fully healthy, and are an absolute nightmare scenario in a three game series. I’ll take the Mets in two.
Those are my surely unbiased and fact-based predictions for this postseason. For my next column, we will be down to the final four, and my utter genius will be reflected in my revised postseason picks.

Sept. 15 will long be remembered as a day of celebration for the South Asian community. Around the country, Brown Americans flocked to Taco Bell to delight in the Mexican Pizza’s triumphant return.
To a community with a plethora of dietary restrictions and an affinity for spice, Taco Bell is sacred — a fast food chain that offers easy substitutions  — sub beans for beef — to make every menu item accessible and sauces spicy enough to make you sweat.
For the uninitiated, the Mexican Pizza is two perfectly fried tostada shells slathered with refried beans and sandwiched together, topped with the Mexican Pizza’s signature salsa and a blend of cheeses and tomatoes baked to perfection. There are few bites of food as transcendent as a piping hot slice of this culinary amalgamation doused in your favorite Taco Bell sauce.
While every item on the menu has its fans, the Mexican Pizza is a cult classic, so it’s no surprise that Taco Bell’s in November 2022 announcement that they were removing the beloved item from the menu sparked outrage. 
Like many South Asian Taco Bell fanatics, I immediately texted the group chat to despair but was met with a call to action. As word spread about the loss, Mexican Pizza lovers began to mobilize by creating petitions, tweeting at Taco Bell and calling for boycotts of the chain.
As the “Save The Mexican Pizza” petition racked up over 170,000 signatures, celebrities like Doja Cat and Dolly Parton joined thousands of community members who demanded the attention of Taco Bell’s Corporate Headquarters. While it took some time and a lot of pressure, the Mexican pizza is back and it’s here to stay.
The tale of the Mexican Pizza is one that offers hope in a world where individual action seems pointless.  As we face problems as seemingly insurmountable as climate change and racism in a country where government action is often inadequate, we feel powerless. 
Compared to the social and environmental issues our country is faced with, the Mexican Pizza debacle is of little consequence. However, this small win serves as a reminder of how effective community action can be.
In the aftermath of any political crisis, from the overturning of Roe v. Wade to the Uvalde school shooting, politicians are quick to remind us to vote for change in the next election. While voting is an important tool in our democratic toolkit, this focus on election cycles turns our attention away from the consistent and constant pressure our community can apply to create change.
Government action is certainly crucial to the success of any movement, but community action comes in all shapes and sizes. From donating time and money to nonprofits to rallying around local activists, every day is an opportunity to respond to unchecked racism, classism, sexism, ableism, homophobia and fatphobia.
When collective community action started a large-scale anti-racism movement in the summer of 2020, we saw how powerful we can be when we come together. After the murder of George Floyd, we as a country were forced to face the continued violence of racism in America. Communities came together and asked for change through a range of tactics, from packed protests to social media callouts to individual conversations.
We weaponized the power of collective action to call for change within a variety of institutions and corporations. Avid fans of “The Bachelor” began to demand change within a franchise marked by racism. Despite airing on ABC for 20 years, the show’s production team had never chosen a Black Bachelor and consistently picked predominantly white men and women as cast members.
“The Bachelor” viewers took this national moment of reckoning as an opportunity to call out the show’s lack of racial diversity and called for changes both in front of and behind the camera. Bachelor Nation favorites like Rachel Lindsay and Kaitlyn Bristowe amplified these audience voices and demanded that the show hold itself accountable.
In response, the show cast Matt James as its first Black Bachelor. As James’s season aired, both James’s final pick, Rachel Kirkconnell, and the show’s host, Chris Harrison, were embroiled in a racism scandal. While the franchise’s response to this scandal was far from perfect, it made the effort to address the issue publicly, which was progress in and of itself.
Though the public pressure yielded promising short-term results, the franchise has walked back many of its race-related promises. Just like Mexican Pizza supporters rallied behind their movement despite a number of setbacks, dedicated fans and former Bachelor contestants continue to call out the show for its racist practices and push the franchise towards an anti-racist future.
Progress is not linear, but our activism must be. Despite the many obstacles we face, effective activism requires that we constantly commit to creating a more just and equitable world. The burden is too exhausting to take on alone.
Community action is the answer to this nearly impossible task. Not only does it multiply our impact, but it also creates a built-in support network for all those involved. When the work becomes overwhelming, we can draw on one another for strength.
In our individualistic society, we praise those who bear their burdens alone, but collective action forces us to change our paradigm. By splitting the weight of the work, we ensure our activism is effective and sustainable. Whether change is bringing back the Mexican Pizza or improving race relations within Bachelor Nation, we’re better when we work together.

As an Asian Australian, I was excited to move to California because I had heard it was more welcoming, diverse and inclusive. Based on narratives from my friends and from what I saw on social media, it seemed as though people were more aware here — it’s not perfect, but dialogue actually exists regarding being racially informed and sensitive to various marginalized communities. In comparison to my home city, I felt that Los Angeles had more prospects in terms of diversity.
However, once I actually arrived in California, not all my expectations were met. While diversity is present — with the Asian population making up 14 percent of L.A. County — racism continues to be perpetuated both by the white majority and those who are marginalized themselves. 
While rushing for a fraternity, I found someone who looked like me. I thought that we’d have some sense of assumed solidarity since we were both Vietnamese people in a white-dominated space. That seemed true at first. He would take every opportunity to tell anyone that happened to find us together that I was Vietnamese too. He treated me differently from the other pledges — at times, it felt like it was to track my whereabouts. This was where all the dots connected. It seemed like he thought that he owned me and felt entitled to my time and presence, simply because I was also Vietnamese. For a guy so obsessed with my ethnicity, I wondered if he forgot his own. His faux-advice and back-handed compliments exhausted me until I ended up leaving the fraternity.
Afterward, I felt alone and surprised, and found the whole situation so absurd. Why would a Vietnamese person, who I’m sure had the same questions as I had about their identity, be stepping on top of me like this? I realized this was part of a greater phenomenon — it’s a systemic issue that arises from white dominance. 
As Pulitzer Prize finalist Cathy Park Hong writes in her book, “Minor Feelings: An Asian American Reckoning,” the view that she seemed to hold was that you, “[see] yourself the way whites see you.” This view leads you to fight and vie for the spot of white validation. You are tricked by the promise of acceptance, only to find out that when you get it, you become a pawn and the laughingstock. The only real winners who gain in this collateral are the same people who started all this: white people.
A good example of this is Ken Jeong, creator of his own Netflix special, “You Complete Me, Ho,” and the actor who portrayed Leslie Chow in “The Hangover” (2009). His jokes revolve around disparaging his wife’s last name and making self-deprecating jokes about his Asian identity, such as his tiny appendage — which, with no doubt, given the energy he exudes, I assume is true. As such a prolific comic, he has the impact of normalizing the negative stereotypes against the Asian community. 
This erodes Asian identity and hurts the representation that the Asian community receives. I can’t blame him too much though — he’s  just following a script most likely created by a white man. After all, if Asian people and people of color become the side characters, who is left to become the main character? That’s right. White men.
In order to solve this problem, we need to recognize the fact that everybody deals with internalized racism. This includes racism perpetuated by people of color toward other marginalized communities, even if it’s to have difficult conversations. The goal isn’t to point fingers, and that’s the slippery slope we’ve fallen down too many times. It’s to hold ourselves accountable in order to create a more cohesive community. No one wants to admit that they are racist, even implicitly, but bits of it unconsciously exist within all of us. After all, decades of indoctrination by Eurocentrism won’t vanish in a moment; there will be traces of its influences on your biases, even after years of unlearning it. 
I hope that one day the Asian community can come together and identify the real target. Our community needs to start asking when and why we started scrambling for white validation. Until we recognize this, our internalized racism will only grow. But with every step, no matter how small, we will pave the way for Asian solidarity and a day when we are all proud of our identity.

Welcome to “The Girls are Gagged,” ladies. Writing this is actually directly replacing my BetterHelp subscription, so buckle up and get ready for me to dump! Shoutout to Keke Palmer for coining the word gagged and creating the most Pisces song of all time, “Dreamcatcher.” We love you, girl. 
Today’s urgent and pressing matter pertains to what has been referred to, by numerous sources within the queer space, as USC’s top shortage. Ahh, how beautiful. Gay men have made their bodies adjacent to toilet paper. Riveting. 
For anyone who is confused, no, we are not referring to the clothing article. And for reasons pertaining to the word count, there will simply be no time to explain what a top and a bottom are. However, as an AnnenBaddie, I can help by saying that it’s similar to the process of communicating; there is sometimes a designated giver and a receiver. A quick Google search can address any confused person’s further curiosities. But for the lazy folks, it deals with who is in “control” during sex.
Back to our regularly scheduled discussion of the top shortage. When I first heard about our shortage, I chuckled. In agreement, of course. Listen … nobody is above the cold hard truth, not even me, as perfect as I am. 
But then I thought about what my favorite YouTuber, Kimberly Nicole Foster ingrained in me. As a Black woman and cultural commentator who spoke about the politics of beauty, Foster taught me that desirability is inherently political — there are implications to what we seek and how we perpetuate it. And so I started to wonder, what conditions have created a need for such a statement? Why is it holding true despite how stupid it might sound?
Listen, maybe there is a top shortage. I’m not here to discredit anyone else’s personal experiences. What I am here to do is offer a critique of how desirability politics come into play and who they benefit. The panic-driven search and never-ending commodification of masculinity that drives us — particularly trans people and femme people — is nowhere near productive. 
This so-called “shortage” implies that we are lacking tops or that there must be an even balance between bottoms and tops. If you think this conversation is merely about positions in sex, you are wrong. There is a historical context of gay men and women being forced — by straight society — to assign themselves gendered roles within their relationships. Thus, whether we like it or not, a conversation about tops and bottoms is actually a conversation about masculinity and femininity and about dominance and submission. Without unlearning this mindset, the gendered power dynamics which have been injected into the LGBTQIA community will remain at play. 
I believe that this notion of a shortage of masculinity or tops is largely constructed by gay men who draw inspiration from heterosexual couples and their power dynamics. 
Gay white men, who seem to derive the most capital and social power within the LGBTQIA community, wield their power to dictate how femininity should exist, within what context, who it should belong to and who it looks good on. For decades, they have marginalized Black lesbians out of gay liberation activism and failed to show up for trans communities — leaving various groups on the sidelines. Gay men have created their own space, but at the cost of perpetuating feminity under the grasp of masculinity, women under men, bottoms under tops, holes under poles. 
If you go on Grindr, even just for a few seconds, you will find profiles that say “straight dl” (as in down-low or not out of the closet) or “dl masc” or “masc only.” While these functionally serve as terms of an agreement — i.e. this is how I identify and you must accept it — they are also means of indicating status. The more adjacent to a straight man you are, the more you are desired. 
Sweetie, I hate to tell you, but your proximity to straightness doesn’t make you any less gay. At the end of the day, it really doesn’t matter who is at the top and who is at the bottom. Nor does the balance of masculinity and femininity need to be controlled. WHO CARES. 
Our expressions of our gender identity do not and should not reduce our humanity or our worthiness and our freedom to seek and find love. What matters is that we cultivate an environment of mutual respect, one where we can appreciate femininity and engage in vulnerability.
Top or bottom, I don’t care. I’ve left the toilet paper aisle and I’m in queer space — reclaiming space for my femininity, appreciating its excellence outside of the context of masculinity and intentionally noticing its beauty.
