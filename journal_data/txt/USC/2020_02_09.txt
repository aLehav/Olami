It’s clear that the University must take great strides in improving the student experience at USC, whether it’s by expanding mental health resources on campus, implementing sustainable practices University-wide or increasing spaces for diverse communities. For this reason, the Daily Trojan Editorial Board endorses Undergraduate Student Government presidential candidate Truman Fritz and vice-presidential candidate Rose Ritch as they best reflect the interests of the USC community.
As president and vice president, Fritz and Ritch would have little problem engaging with student-run organizations and administration as their campus influence extends across various student groups. Fritz, who currently serves as the senior director of communications at USG, and Ritch, who is currently a senator, both have the necessary experience and proven determination to effect a meaningful shift in campus culture. 
After conducting interviews with each ticket, it was clear the Truman & Rose ticket had clear, ambitious and feasible goals in their campaign platform. From the get-go, they were clear in saying merely two people cannot support all undergraduate students, which is why they said, if elected, they will govern through collaboration with other campus leaders to identify the gaps in USC’s resources. 
“I believe … [in] our goals of being able to engage with the entire student body — and again, pulling back to two people cannot represent 20,000 — and that’s something we entirely acknowledge,” Ritch said. “That’s something that we really want to make a priority bringing the students in and I think we seem very eye-to-eye on everything.”
The Truman & Rose ticket sets itself apart from the others in its acknowledgment that USC is a revenue-generating business that often has conflicting interests that counter those of the student body. We believe this acknowledgment is key to addressing the many concerns that the student body has had recently with the administration regarding corruption and a lack of accountability. USC is an institution for higher learning, but it is also a corporation that is constantly seeking profit, and these values often get in the way of each other. Fritz and Ritch understand this, which we believe is beneficial in encouraging change within the administration.
Fritz and Ritch embody an effective working pair. Built on friendship and mutual values, Fritz and Ritch’s connection is authentic and therefore, the Editorial Board has concluded, necessary in leading the multi-million dollar enterprise that is USG. Whereas many of the other tickets seemed to show a disconnect and imbalance between the presidential candidate and the vice presidential candidate, Fritz and Ritch demonstrate a collaborative, balanced partnership that will facilitate their success as USG leaders.
On the subject of the transfer and new student experience, Fritz and Ritch spoke empathetically about the unfair treatment that many transfer and spring admit students get, noting that these students are given a different and less comprehensive orientations. Fritz and Ritch supplied meaningful solutions to problems surrounding the inclusion of these communities. 
Fritz proposed a fix as simple as issuing transfer or spring admit students their USC ID cards earlier than orientation so these students could use the facilities on campus such as the gym in an effort to acclimate to campus life. By providing manageable and meaningful changes to problems like these, the Truman and Rose ticket shows its commitment to inclusion for all members of the student body.
Fritz and Ritch recognize that sustainability is one of the major and shared goals of each presidential ticket but distinguish themselves by having the most aggressive platform to find campus-wide solutions. After reviewing the drafted 2028 Sustainability Plans for the University, Fritz noted that the administration’s plans were not ambitious enough and that there needs to be accountability if these goals are not met. 
Their plan ranges from phasing out single-use plastics to educating students on living sustainable lives during their academic tenure and beyond. Most notably, the campaign draws from meetings with the administration and the 2020 sustainability goals that were not met and uses these as a guiding force that furthers environmental consciousness on the USC campus as a whole. 
The duo admitted that issues surrounding mental health have affected them both during their time at the University and, in turn, want to prioritize student health and well-being. If elected, they plan to take a “student-first” approach to address the current mental health crisis. Fritz and Ritch intend to improve upon existing resources by increasing the diversity of the counselors at Engemann Student Health Center to serve underrepresented communities and by working with the current Student Assembly for Accessibility to accommodate students when mental health may affect their academic attendance and performance.
Most of all, the Daily Trojan Editorial Board recognizes Fritz and Ritch’s propensity for serving the USC community with clear and attainable goals that, if elected, will help shift our University’s focus to initiatives and efforts that put students first. This is important to consider once students cast their votes this week.

Operating on a $2.4 million budget, the Undergraduate Student Government is responsible for funding various student organizations and resources, including free legal counseling and HIV testing for students. Created from a $64 line item in each undergraduate student’s tuition, the budget’s allocation is decided by the USG treasurer, a member of the Budget Allocations Committee.
More than half of the USG budget is designated toward Programming Allocations, where budget members are made up of student committees and cultural assemblies. Programming Allocation is determined through a cooperative process between budget members and the Budget Allocations Committee. 
The Budget Allocations Committee decides how much funding a student organization, or budget member, will receive based on the group’s funding proposal and its previous spending history, according to USG Treasurer Rohan Parepally.
“One to two times a year, we revisit the budget to see how people are spending their money,” Parepally said. “[We see] whether the money is being effectively spent and then if we could re-allocate it to areas that could use it.”
USG’s Concerts Committee received a budget of $589,000, about 42% of all programming allocations.
Budget members meet with Parepally each month to evaluate previous spending habits and raise any concerns or requests for additional financial assistance. Having one month between meetings allows the members enough freedom to work out any issues internally without the government overreaching, Parepally said. 
Nearly one-fifth of the budget is directed toward departments under the funding branch, which includes the discretionary and the philanthropy funds. According to Parepally, the funding branch serves as a pool of extra funding for student programs that need additional financial support. 
The philanthropy fund distributes money for philanthropic and community outreach events hosted by student organizations which have exceeded their budget, Parepally said. The discretionary fund supports student groups organizing cultural and entertainment events, acting as a safety net if the organizations spend beyond their allocated budget.
About $150,000 of the budget is directed toward executive cabinet allocations, broken up by three main funding accounts: administration, development and executive/legislative. Administrative expenses include costs for the USG office such as maintenance and office supplies, while the executive/legislative account is a discretionary pool of funding that the executive cabinet can elect to allocate to additional initiatives that USG members choose to pursue.
With a budget of $57,541, the development account refers to internal organizational development such as retreats and banquets to emphasize team bonding and goal-setting. The purpose of development is to allow USG members to gather in an independent space to focus on the future of the organization outside of their office work.
USG pays a lawyer to come in every week to offer free consultations to the student body on any legal issues students may encounter. The consultation may result in the lawyer assuming the student’s case, wherein the lawyer will only charge the student a service fee if the case rules in the student’s favor. However, this is not the main intent of legal services.
The free legal consultation is intended to support students who have legal questions pertaining to personal damages or inquiries into a student’s rights regarding University policies. USG uses these services to offer students an initial guide for navigating legal procedures and is not intended to support full legal representation.
The budget also includes a category of restricted funds consisting mainly of student stipends and staff salaries for members of USG that are deducted from the initial amount. According to Parepally, USG aims for standardized student pay rates across the entire government body.
“A big thing that we’re trying is to make sure that we are equitable across all of [the government body] and [are] just compensating students for their time and participation in student government,” Parepally said. 
He also stressed the importance of distributing as much of the budget back into the student population that provides the government its funding as possible. According to Parepally, the goal of the committee is to keep administrative spending low to maintain a high remaining balance to distribute to external budget members such as the campus cultural assemblies and special events committees.

Student government elections used to be more than platform points and debates. 
When running for student senator in 1962, Donald Segretti entered a race where disruption campaigns, spying and cheating were fixtures in USC’s student politics. With headline-grabbing accusations from candidates and open warfare between student political groups, the elections erupted with controversies unprecedented in today’s student government.
The ’62 student elections featured Segretti and other students who’d work for President Nixon’s reelection campaign a decade later — a campaign notable for its political sabotage and the Watergate scandal.
Cheating to win was a tactic Segretti and the others learned during their undergraduate years. 
As a member of Trojans for Representative Government, Segretti met other future Watergate figures in the group, including White House Press Secretary Ron Ziegler and Nixon’s deputy assistant President Dwight Chapin — altogether known as the “USC Mafia.”
During the student elections, Chapin and Segretti engaged in what Washington Post reporters Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein would later call “ratfucking,” a term used by USC students to describe gaining a political advantage through dirty tricks and cheating. 
According to the two reporters, members of TRG stuffed ballot boxes with false votes, planted spies in other student political organizations and spread false campaign literature about other candidates during the student elections. 
Moving from college politics to the national presidency, nothing changed. While working to dismantle Democratic candidate Edmund Muskie’s presidential campaign in 1972, Segretti sent a forged letter to the press alleging Muskie was prejudiced against French Canadian Americans. Segretti later pleaded guilty to the Watergate-related charges and served four months in jail.
Segretti’s tumultuous senatorial campaign was a product of USC’s system for student government in the ’60s.
Known as the Associated Students of Southern California, USC’s student government was made up of students from multiple student political parties, including TRG, the Representation Party and the underground Theta Nu Epsilon. Instead of having 12 senators as the current Undergraduate Student Government does, ASSC’s legislative body consisted of senators who represented specific academic majors. 
Political parties openly clashed with each other in Spring 1962, unafraid of singling out opposing candidates to better their own chances. 
TRG Chairman Chapin, who later served nine months in prison for his involvement with Watergate in 1974, attacked USC presidential candidate Gil Garcetti by claiming his filing as “independent” was inaccurate due to his membership to the Chi Phi fraternity, while candidate Dann Moss accused Garcetti of using “circus techniques” in his campaign.
The platform points for the 1962 presidential candidates serve as a testament to their time. Candidates sought to extend library hours to 11 p.m., develop programs for “foreign” students and create an accessible student directory. However, similar to today, many candidates called for greater representation of student groups in the student government.
With distrust surging between opposing political parties, student groups worked to prevent outsiders from gaining information. Chapin sparked protests during the election by attempting to rework TRG’s constitution to bar students from joining who had previously worked with any other political party on campus.
“With the type of underground political situation that exists on this campus, we would be infiltrated and broken by [Theta Nu Epsilon] if we opened our ranks to all students,” Chapin told the Daily Trojan in 1962. Chapin also publicly blamed TNE as the main source of organizational difficulties for the Representation Party.
Attacks between parties grew worse as the voting period drew nearer. 
In a rally for presidential candidate Moss, two students rioted by throwing eggs at  Moss and other rally speakers, which was rumored to have been caused by other “unfriendly political factions,” though not proven. A sound truck for presidential candidate Garcetti had its sign “torn down and burned and the truck itself mobbed” and no suspects were found, according to a Daily Trojan article.
On March 15, the first day of voting, controversy broke among students and political groups over illegal votes and improper ballot procedures. This included the president of TRG, who complained he witnessed votes being counted without confirmating the identity of the students, similar to the actions Watergate reporters Woodward and Bernstein had later accused TRG of doing. 
After winning a three-way runoff vote, TRG was victorious — TRG candidate Bart Ledder captured the ASSC presidency and Segretti won the senatorial position. The Daily Trojan described the election as “one of the longest, most controversial and emotion-packed elections in USC history.” In the story recounting the announcement of the result, the Daily Trojan wrote that “a crowded Senate Chambers throbbed with victory cries” as the TRG candidate was “carried to the top of the Senate table on the shoulders of his enthusiastic supporters.” 
TRG’s victory reached further than USC’s student elections. With the line between aspirations and ethics now blurred, members of TRG understood what political success took. As Chapin, Segretti and other members of the USC Mafia made their way to the national stage, the ’62 ASSC elections served as a microcosm of what would take place in the future on a much larger scale.

When Trenton Stone first began his term as president of the Undergraduate Student Government, he kept a suitcase stuffed with spare clothes in his office. Stone also stored extra toothpaste and face wash in his desk and slept on a bean bag during late nights. Tasked with leading an organization of more than 100 members and coordinating a multi-million dollar budget, Stone spent little time outside his small cubicle last spring. 
Now, despite Stone’s noticeable presence on campus, the details of his daily life are largely unknown to those outside of USG. Stone faces a demanding schedule of meeting with administrators and managing an expansive organization, all while juggling the responsibilities of a full-time student. 
After a morning workout, Stone typically arrives at the USG office at 8:30 a.m. to prepare for the day’s meetings, which include appointments with senior administrators and check-ins with other USG personnel. On a typical day, Stone has five to six meetings staggered in accordance with his class schedule. 
Vice President Mahin Tahsin often accompanies Stone to meetings to provide a different perspective on student-related issues. During one 20-minute phone conversation with Vice President of Student Affairs Winston Crisp and two other senior administrative officials, Tahsin assisted Stone in discussing USG’s upcoming and first-ever presentation to the Board of Trustees. The duo plans to present USG’s semesterly agenda and ongoing projects, including transfer forgiveness programs and CalFresh subsidies. 
Stone believes this is an important step in the ongoing efforts to get a student representative on the Board.
“I think we are a good touchstone to build that bridge between the community and the Board of Trustees,” he said. 
The meeting emphasized the kinship between Stone and Tahsin, who met working at the funding department at USG. Tahsin said their shared values and approaches to USG brought them together when initially deciding to run in Spring 2019. Both USG leaders stressed the importance of building relationships to help execute initiatives that require significant administrative backing. 
“I think that relationship building,     whether it’s the Board of Trustees, whether it’s higher administration, whether it’s even just students — that’s what holds us together,” Tahsin said. 
Stone tries to fit in time for meals between meetings but usually relies solely on caffeine throughout the day. Due to his rigorous schedule, every moment is packed with work for class or USG. 
On a Thursday in January, Stone attends a planning meeting for zero waste events, which is a part of USC’s sustainability steering committee. During the meeting, members discuss how to make smaller-scale events zero waste, including functions at individual departments and colleges. While not officially a part of the task force, Stone tries to stay engaged in different sustainability discussions happening around campus. 
By 11:30 a.m., Stone usually meets with another administrator, this time with Crisp, whom he meets with weekly to review ongoing USG initiatives. Stone and Crisp have developed a close working relationship and regularly call each other on issues impacting the student body. After rumors spread that the coronavirus was present at an off-campus apartment near USC, Stone called Crisp, allowing him to mobilize other members of the administration to respond. 
During the meeting, Stone and Crisp spoke about USG’s restructuring initiative and increasing the number of resource spaces for students on campus. The discussion lasted an hour and a half, forcing Stone to miss one of his two classes that day. 
Stone, a junior majoring in philosophy and international relations (global business), said that being USG president is often overwhelming. While he’s adapted to high levels of stress since his presidential campaign, juggling classwork and extensive USG responsibilities has taken its toll on his well-being. 
“One of the biggest challenges of the position is that even when you become busy with academics, or if you’re emotionally drained, the organization and USC continues on, and you have to be available to meet those demands,” Stone said. 
If Stone finishes his classes by 3:30 p.m., he’ll quickly return to the USG office. That Thursday he rushed back to meet with Isha Sanghvi, director of human resources at Los Angeles Community Impact. Stone was heavily involved with LACI, a student consulting group for nonprofit organizations, during his first two years at USC before becoming USG president. While Stone can no longer dedicate extensive amounts of time to the organization, he volunteered to help interview candidates for LACI membership. 
USG members often stop by to seek mentorship from Stone. This time senatorial candidate Lennon Wesley III stopped by his office to learn about USG restructuring plans. The two former senate aides also caught up on their personal lives and lamented the current news cycle.
In his final meeting of the day, at 5 p.m.,  Stone led the weekly USG executive board meeting where members, including Treasurer Rohan Parepally and Chief Diversity Officer Jeffrey Cho, provided updates on personal projects and the work of their respective teams. 
Stone has since moved his wardrobe back to his apartment — aside from one suit for emergencies — and refocused on maintaining a healthier work-life balance. He credits his executive team as his support system for when the job is too overwhelming. 
“I think it’s about just being honest and open with people about when you can’t give more and when you have certain limits and pulling away when you can try to rely on your team to fill in some of those gaps,” Stone said.

At the eighth annual Latinx Student Empowerment Conference, hosted by La CASA and the Latino Business Student Association, keynote speakers Tournament of Roses President Laura Farber, President Carol Folt and trustee Michael Felix spoke on overcoming the barriers of being underrepresented in their academic and work fields. 
The conference, which more than 100 students and community members attended, featured financial literacy workshops, research panels such as “The Water Crisis in La Guajira, Colombia” and an alumni panel to share their academic experiences in the Latinx community at USC. 
“Experiencing what I went through last semester at USC with the Fluor Tower flooding as well as some racism and the lack of inclusivity on campus, that made me feel the need to attend this event to at least get some sort of self-empowerment in me,” said Carol Alata, a freshman majoring in computational neuroscience. “Attending this event fulfilled that.”
In October, more than 30 Fluor Tower residents relocated to temporary housing after sprinklers flooded the Latinx community floor. Racist memes targeting the Latinx residents surfaced after the flooding. 
Farber began the conference by sharing her experience as a daughter of immigrants who fled from Argentina to the United States after facing political oppression from the militaristic government.
“We came to this country because this country represented a beacon of hope: hope for freedom of speech, expression, association, religion, to pursue your educational and economic opportunities,” Farber said. “A lot of people take that for granted. We didn’t have [that opportunity].”
Farber chose poder de la esperanza, or “power of hope” as this year’s Rose Bowl parade theme, inspired by her parents’ immigrant experience. She also chose to highlight various cultures in the parade by including bands from across the country and the world, such as the Centenaria Banda Colegial University of  Mayagüez, Puerto Rico, and the Japan Honor Green Band. 
“A lot of folks thought, ‘OK, we understand there’s a lot of sabor Latino in this parade,’ but if you looked at our parade, we had everybody represented,” Farber said. “It was the veritable U.N. That’s how [the Rose Bowl] should be. It should be inclusion.”
She also talked about her pride in having this year’s parade represent her Latinx community. 
“Going down that [parade route] and seeing my community represented — the majority of my community — because I would guess that 80% of the people in that route were Latino … they were all thrilled,” Farber said. “They said, ‘Thank you for el poder de la esperanza, thank you for making us feel included.’”
Later on, Folt spoke on her experience as an outsider in a community she was not the majority in, including when she was a transfer student at UC Santa Barbara and the only female doctoral student at Michigan State University. She also described her experience finding a sense of belonging and advised students on how to find it at the university level. 
“Everyone wants to belong [at a university], not just because you got accepted here and earned your place here but because you helped make it something that you want to be a part of, something that you can believe in and something that really matters to you,” Folt said. 
Folt also announced her plan to create a program that helps make college affordable for middle-class students.
“As a university, we must be committed to making sure that our student body is diverse and vibrant,” Folt said. “To do that, we must be aggressive in pursuing policies that can help tackle things like affordability.”
At the end of her speech, Folt opened the discussion up to audience questions. Sabrina Perla, a freshman majoring in business administration, asked Folt how she overcame her sense of being an outsider as an underrepresented individual. Folt said that students should think of people and events that they have made an impact in and use it as validation in attending an elite university. 
“You know that you did things that have already touched a lot of people. I think it never hurts to remind yourself that’s who you are,” Folt said. “The fact that you go to a new place, and it’s like ‘Whoa, it’s so big, everyone looks so confident and successful.’ Don’t let that [affect your ability to see] who you are … Never give in to that imposter syndrome that we all have.”
As the last keynote speaker, Felix shared his experience as a student at USC. He said he was grateful for receiving an education but felt excluded from an institution with a majority of privileged students.
“After my work-study job … I’d walk to Figueroa to catch the bus to go home,” Felix said. “Seeing all these BMWs driving by, all these fancy cars and one Friday afternoon as I was sitting on that bus — that’s when I made that vow to say, ‘My children will never come [to USC].’”
Returning to campus as an alumnus, he said he has felt the inclusion he hungered for as a student. He advised students to embrace the Trojan Family network, which he didn’t take advantage of 40 years ago. 
He also discussed with attendees his experience as a Latinx man in business and how he did not let his identity define his place in the field. 
“I’ve always realized I was one of the few Latinx professionals in [my companies], and it only got ridiculously worse as I’ve progressed,” Felix said. “I thought of myself as a business leader who happened to be Latinx … At the end of the day, what you can bring to the business trumps color, gender, all those other factors.”
Sofia Reyes, a sophomore majoring in health promotion and disease prevention, said she could relate to Felix’s undergraduate experience, as she is often the sole Latinx woman in spaces at USC. 
“I have grown to despise … how much of a bubble USC is in terms of elitism, but then that [Felix] was inspired to come back to help pave the way for people like him — that was super inspiring,” Reyes said. 
Felix, who attended the entire conference, said he felt the workshops and speeches could appeal to a wider audience in the University community outside of Latinx students. 
“[The conference showed] another picture of how amazing our student body is, our Latinx community,” Felix said. “Many of the sessions today don’t just apply to students … There’s so much more content here in terms of things to help you be more successful or how you navigate certain challenges.”
Correction: A previous version of this article reported that the event was the Latinx Empowerment Conference. It is named the Latinx Student Empowerment Conference. The Daily Trojan regrets this error.

As a fashion columnist, it would be an egregious oversight for me not to mention that it is currently New York Fashion Week, where brands will showcase their autumn/winter ready-to-wear collections. The week officially kicked off this Monday, Feb. 3 and goes until this Wednesday. Some brands that are showing include Helmut Lang, The Row and Marc Jacobs. Some brands that include not showing are Ralph Lauren, Tommy Hilfiger and Pyer Moss. The brand that made waves by ditching New York for Los Angeles, Tom Ford, staged his runway show Friday night at Milk Studios Hollywood in front of a gaggle of celebrity attendees, including Jennifer Lopez, Kylie Jenner and Lil Nas X. 
OK, great! Now that’s out of the way …
Look, I know I should care. For fashion reporters, NYFW is basically awards season for entertainment writers or election time for political journalists. Fashion Week happens twice a year, once in spring and once in fall, and it’s a whirlwind of runway shows, street-style candids and cocktail parties, where everyone jostles to see and be seen. As someone who one day aspires to the position of Vanessa Friedman or Robin Givhan, wading into the thick of NYFW is non-negotiable. 
And yet, I kind of … don’t care. And I’m not the only one who feels that way, as a rash of articles have popped up in the last few days declaring NYFW “irrelevant” and explaining the decision to skip the whole thing entirely. 
It’s evident that NYFW is losing its luster. But let me be clear: It’s only New York that I’m feeling “meh” about. London, Milan and Paris Fashion Week are still on the calendar, and I’m extremely excited to see what they deliver. But for New York, the hype simply isn’t there — it’s moved overseas. 
When it comes to New York’s roster, there are only a few brands I’m interested in seeing: Sandy Liang, Eckhaus Latta, Khaite. Other buzzy emerging designers I would’ve loved to see, like Maryam Nassir Zadeh and Pyer Moss, have opted out of the fracas entirely. The rest … I can take it or leave it. 
These are brands that are culturally relevant, that are inspiring discussion and moving the fashion conversation forward. Sandy Liang’s neon-trimmed fleeces, inspired by her childhood, were dubbed the hottest jacket in menswear by GQ; Eckhaus Latta recently mounted a full-scale solo exhibition at the Whitney Museum of American Art. Over the summer, Katie Holmes went viral when she stepped out in Khaite’s cashmere bra, which instantly sold out. 
It’s no coincidence that all my picks are smaller, less established brands. That’s because I’d actually wear their clothes — they’re still luxury, with all the creative flair and fine craftsmanship that entails, but they’re also way more accessible and suited for everyday wear. Whereas the heavy-hitters who’ve been around forever, simply aren’t made for the general public. I mean, Tom Ford’s show was gorgeous — Bella Hadid strutted in slinky, body-skimming chainmail — but his line is utterly unwearable. I don’t need to watch their runway shows because, one, I’m not going to see anything I’d realistically put on my own body, and two, I already know I’ll see the dresses later in some red carpet roundup. 
Plus, there were shows that were just plain bad. Christian Siriano (who does great work advancing diversity and size inclusivity in fashion) based his collection on “Birds of Prey,” the new Harley Quinn movie. Of course not every season needs to go down in history books, but … why? I liked some looks, such as a ruffly black leather getup, but some, like a confetti-colored fringed bolero, looked like something you’d get at Party City and then toss in the trash after spilling your martini on it. 
It seems more and more people in fashion are becoming disillusioned with Fashion Week. A survey from industry news publication Fashionista that asked industry professionals their thoughts on Fashion Week garnered nearly 500 responses and revealed mixed feelings; a majority of respondents said they felt it was a waste of time and resources and that mounting big runway shows, not to mention attendees jetting around the world, exacted an environmental toll. Either way, the future of NYFW is in flux, and, in an industry infamous for its mercurial nature, there’s no telling what next season will bring.

Vibrant colors and explosive fight scenes make Cathy Yan’s “Birds of Prey” a wildly entertaining film, notwithstanding the few weak plot points that fail to bring the movie’s energy down.
Harley Quinn and the Joker have called it quits. Quinn, played by Margot Robbie, goes through standard breakup procedure by having a catastrophic meltdown (literally — she triggers a chemical explosion) and cutting her hair. Her process includes battling the entirety of Gotham City, since once she loses the Joker’s protection, everyone with any grievance against her comes for her life. 
To gain protection from sadistic nightclub owner Roman Sionis (Ewan McGregor), Quinn is tasked with locating Cassandra Cain (Ella Jay Basco) for him, a young pickpocket who has stolen and swallowed a diamond worth fortunes. 
Across town, fiery detective Renee Montoya (Rosie Perez) takes part in the manhunt for Quinn, though she is held back by her department’s underestimation of her after not getting credit for a breakthrough case years ago.
To add to the mix, Sionis’ personal driver, Dinah Lance (Jurnee Smollet-Bell), otherwise known as Black Canary, pretends to be under his thumb to help him locate Cain while secretly relaying information back to Montoya. The pairing of Black Canary and Montoya is especially fun to watch, as both women are efficient and clever in their scheme. 
In the end, all of the women must work together to protect Cain from Sionis’ violence, along with The Huntress (Mary Elizabeth Winstead), an abrupt inclusion toward the end. While another powerful female protagonist should be welcomed, her inclusion feels rushed and haphazard.
“Birds of Prey” is a women-led superhero film that is neither prequel nor period piece — the first of its kind. It’s debatable whether Quinn even counts as a superhero, but Robbie’s character is more intriguing because of this confusion. Although she has selfish and violent tendencies, she also displays moments of morality and goodness, giving her a likable anti-hero status that’s more human than any invincible, unrealistically perfect protagonist. And, blessedly, she has no love interest.
Some critics nitpick the fact that Quinn wears gaudy outfits — such as a flashy golden jumpsuit over a pink sports bra — while fighting off bad guys, as female superheroes tend to have more sexualized, impractical wardrobes. However, Quinn’s character is interwoven with a need to express her chaotic personality through colors and sparkles. Harley Quinn is Harley Quinn because of her ridiculousness, which includes an absurd wardrobe for hand-to-hand combat and shoot-outs.
Her look is a testament to the complexity of womanhood: Quinn is a strong fighter—at times fending off almost a dozen men at once—yet also feminine and eccentric in her style. She likes to fool around, but at the end of the day, she’s ingenuitive in her ways of escaping danger. 
Moreover, Quinn’s illusion of ditziness ends up being the downfall of her enemies, as they underestimate her abilities without her ex-boyfriend. She’ll sometimes shock those around her by revealing her intellect, like when she is captured by Sionis and psychoanalyzes him right as he threatens her life. She connects his need for power to his childhood, a quip that makes the audience laugh while also reminding us that she has a doctorate in psychiatry.
With Puerto Rican, Black and Korean/Filipino women as three of the five main characters, “Birds of Prey” is remarkably diverse. In addition to racial representation, the cast ranges in age: Basco, playing Cain, is 13 years old, and Perez is 55 years old, yet that didn’t stop her from performing all of Montoya’s stunts herself. Montoya is also openly gay in the film, even having a few scenes with her ex. And neither of them die!
Even though they don’t always work together, there are many instances of each woman saving the others, with a notable lack of male saviors. Black Canary prevents Quinn from getting kidnapped while drunk in her post-breakup downfall; the Huntress helps the other women fend off an army of bounty hunters without any personal stake in the matter; and Quinn does everything in her power, including latching herself to a speeding car on her roller skates to save Cain in the end.
While “Birds of Prey” contains many empowering messages about female solidarity, the plot lacks in other ways: It’s as chaotic as Quinn’s personality, which can be fun at times but also jarring. Some of the jokes don’t hit quite right, such as a moment where Quinn accidentally inhales cocaine before a fight scene and a misplaced Frida Kahlo gag.
Additionally, its diversity isn’t foolproof. The other women in the cast are given unequal amounts of backstory, with The Huntress having about five real lines but receiving overly-extensive exposition of her past. 
The writers missed a huge opportunity by not including any of Black Canary’s backstory. Her character is clever, dynamic and relatably down-to-earth; and yet, she only gets to use her power once. This lends to the ever-present Black sidekick stereotype, but it’s hard to see her as such when she proves her capabilities repeatedly in other ways. We also never get much character depth from Cain besides a bit of backstory about her parents. 
Still, this group of women is refreshing because their diversity reflects reality. It doesn’t feel forced, as the film doesn’t pretend that these women are all best friends skipping toward a happy ending together — there’s understandable conflict between some of them, and they must temporarily work together until splitting up into two groups at the end.
Despite the few plot hiccups, “Birds of Prey” is a story of empowerment and complexity showing the extraordinary power that women can have when banding together against powers bigger than themselves.

The way fans view and interact with their favorite sports is poised to undergo major changes as legalized sports gambling spreads nationwide. In 2018, the United States Supreme Court’s ruling in Murphy v. NCAA overturned a federal law limiting legal sports betting to a few states, thus allowing any state to legalize and regulate gambling on athletic events.
The case’s repercussions have already been astounding: Twenty states and counting have legalized sports gambling in some form since the Murphy ruling less than two years ago.
Though California has not yet joined the ranks of the states that have legalized betting on athletic events, the State Legislature is currently holding hearings on legalized, regulated sports betting. Even if those hearings do not lead to the passing of a law, an initiative proposing legalization will likely appear on California voters’ ballots in the November election.
It is no secret that before the Murphy decision — when sports gambling was outlawed in the majority of states — sports fans throughout the country nonetheless bet on athletic events through an underground market.
Illegal bookies and offshore websites filled the vacuum left in the absence of a legal avenue for sports gambling. Estimates vary on the exact size of the underground market, but economists who have tried to tackle the issue agree that it is massive: A 1999 congressional report estimated the market to be worth about $80 billion while more recent studies have estimated the figure to be up to $150 billion. To put that into perspective, the former estimate would put the underground sports gambling industry as being worth about seven times what the American film industry grossed in the box office last year.
Legalization would shift sports gambling to regulated platforms, alleviating sports bettors’ concerns about exploitation carried out by illegal bookies and offshore websites beyond the reach of law enforcement.
This transition of a large, pre-existing base of regular sports bettors away from the underground market and toward government-sanctioned platforms has accelerated the effects of legalization.
Profound changes are already afoot in the sports media landscape. ESPN, Fox Sports and other major outlets have made concerted efforts to add programming centered around sports gambling and integrate gambling discussions into their coverage of major sporting events. Perhaps the most prominent example of this occurred last weekend when ESPN and Fox decided to display graphics about betting lines during their broadcasts of the inaugural XFL games. In addition, Barstool Sports recently announced a partnership with casino operator Penn National Gaming in a deal intended to promote and monetize its coverage of sports gambling.
The common thread among the effects of the Murphy decision allowing for states to legalize sports gambling is the widening de-stigmatization of sports betting. 
Above all, sports are supposed to be fun — fans in our community at USC and throughout the country use sports as an outlet to come together and to experience a release from the stresses and pressures of life to whatever extent. Though there are many similarities among sports fans, the way everyone interacts with them is different.
Some fans swear off betting and focus exclusively on an unwavering allegiance to their favorite teams. Others take great enjoyment in engaging in wagers. Rather than making a futile attempt to change fans’ behavior by outlawing sports gambling, state governments across the country are rightly protecting and legitimizing sports bettors by providing them a regulated platform to engage in gambling. Let’s hope California is next.

The No. 16 USC women’s lacrosse team defeated the Hofstra Pride 9-8 in a nail-biting non-conference season opener in Hempstead, N.Y. Saturday. The Trojans have started their last five seasons off with a win and are now 2-0 all-time against the Pride.
USC prevailed with a 33-degree wind chill at James M. Shuart Stadium. Eight Trojans returned to play at home in Long Island as Trojan fans overtook the stands. In total, 24 of the 33 Trojans on this year’s roster hail from the Eastern seaboard.
Graduate attacker Emily Concialdi from Yorktown Heights, N.Y. scored the first 2 goals of the Trojans’ 2020 season and added on the game-winner in the last two minutes off a critical free possession shot.
“It was a really long pause before I had to take the eight-meter, but we practice [those shots] every single day,” Concialdi said about scoring the final goal. “And I’m always … trying to be very fast off the line while in practice and it paid off. So I was very excited and also very confident going into that because I knew I put in the work in the offseason.”
Each team scored only once in the game’s first 23 minutes. Hofstra senior midfielder Alyssa Parrella, who U.S. Lacrosse Magazine called “one of the nation’s least talked about impact players,” took the Pride’s first goal of the season off an assist from junior attacker Katie Whelan.
Hofstra sophomore goalie Jess Smith had eight saves in the first half, bolstering the Pride’s defense and proving to be a difficult obstacle for the Trojans. In total, Smith had a career-high 14 saves in the game compared to USC junior goalie Riley Hertford’s 11.
The Trojans used an aggressive offensive strategy, taking 36 shots in total with 23 of them on goal. Hofstra favored a more settled approach, waiting out the shot clock and shooting only 23 times with 19 of them on goal.
The first half ended favoring the Trojans 4-2, but the Pride returned heated at the start of the second. Hofstra senior midfielder Alexa Mattera, who scored 4 goals in total, equalized the score at 4 just three minutes into the second half. Concialdi’s dish to USC sophomore midfielder Erin Bakes brought the score to 5-4 Trojans, but 4 of the next 5 goals went to the Pride.
The Trojans struggled to gain possession of the draw, particularly in the second half. In total, the Pride carried 13 out of the 19 draw controls led by Hofstra senior defender Darcie Smith. The Pride, on the other hand, could not match the Trojans’ defensive vigor in the midfield and turned the ball over during some key clears. The Trojans won out with 16 turnovers versus the Pride’s 21. USC sophomore defender Kaleigh Brennan celebrated with career-highs of two caused turnovers and four ground balls.
“I think it was a very good game,” Concialdi said. “It showed us what we have to still work on and also showed us what our strengths are, so I think … building off of this game we’re excited to get to practice on Monday and, knowing what we have to still work on, we’ll take it from there.”
With Hofstra up 8-6, the Trojans answered by shutting out the Pride in the last 16 minutes of the game. Senior attacker Hope Anhut rolled from the back of Hofstra’s crease in order to spark the 3-0 run that would lead to a Trojan victory. Senior midfielder and Tewaarton Award candidate Kerrigan Miller, who scored 2 goals during the game, tied the match by shooting off her own rebound.
“To come back down 2 and get the last 3 goals of the game is a testament of them sticking together and trusting each other, and then really executing when it mattered,” USC head coach Lindsey Munday said.
The Trojans improved to 14-15 record in games played in the Eastern time zone and 5-3 all-time in season openers. 
“I think it’s awesome,” Munday said. “It’s a starting point, the first game of the season … and so we want to continue to improve. We’re really fired up about the season and excited about where it’s going and now we just got to continue to get better every day.” 
The Trojans take on the No. 8 Michigan Wolverines in their first home game of the season at Soni McAlister Field this Saturday at noon.

The USC men’s basketball team could not find a way to pull out a win against the Arizona State Sun Devils Saturday night, losing 66-64 in Tempe, Ariz. 
A last effort 3-point attempt from senior guard Jonah Mathews did not fall for USC after ASU took a 2-point lead with 19 seconds remaining. Mathews may have been fouled on the play but did not receive a call, capping off a disappointing Grand Canyon State road trip.
“I take the blame for the loss,” head coach Andy Enfield said. “I could’ve done a few things differently tonight, so we win and lose together.” 
The Sun Devils, who entered Saturday’s game with a 5-4 conference record and a two-game win streak, entered the game with a chance to move ahead of the Trojans in the Pac-12. On the other hand, USC knew that this game — especially with it being on the road — was crucial for its NCAA Tournament hopes.
The Trojans got off to a hot start, jumping out to a 15-7 lead in the first five minutes of the game as the Sun Devils had a hard time making their shots fall in the first half. The Trojans took advantage of Arizona State’s missed opportunities, going into halftime with an 8-point lead.
It did not take long out of the break for the Sun Devils to get going, however, as ASU crawled back and took its first lead of the game with 12 minutes remaining. USC tried to keep the game close but fell apart in the final two minutes of the game, giving up a 7-0 run to close things out.
“I thought we lost our composure midway through the second half, and then they took the lead and I thought we regained [composure],” Enfield said.  “And then we retook the lead and then we made a couple of big mistakes and then we threw the ball away … We have to execute.”
The biggest difference in the game for the Trojans was the Sun Devils’ game plan against freshman forward Onyeka Okongwu. The Sun Devils limited Okongwu, who was recently named a finalist for the 2020 Kareem Abdul-Jabbar Award for the nation’s top collegiate center, to only 5 points. In addition, USC turned the ball over an astonishing 24 times, giving ASU extra possessions.
“Our big guys had their share of turnovers just like our guards, so we have to do a better job of playing team basketball,” Enfield said. “We try to break the press and try to score out of it … but with 24 turnovers, it’s just too many.”
Both teams would finish with 42 rebounds and eight 3-pointers. USC finished with a 41.8% shooting percentage while ASU finished at 31.3%. Even though the Trojans shot at a better rate than the Sun Devils, they could not find a way to capitalize when it mattered most.
USC has now lost three straight after starting the season 17-4. 
“We’re inconsistent in general,” Enfield said. “We’re a good team but we have inconsistencies in some things we do like turn the ball over, like shooting open shots. There are certain things we’ve done this year that make us inconsistent offensively and defensively, but we’re still a good team.”
The Pac-12 has been interesting of late, as both No. 14 Oregon and No. 23 Arizona lost Saturday as well. With seven more regular-season conference games to go for USC, the Trojans still have an outside chance to compete for the Pac-12 regular-season championship and could earn a first-round bye in the Pac-12 Tournament by securing a top-four finish.
USC will look to avenge the disappointing loss when it returns home to take on the Washington Huskies at Galen Center Thursday at 6 p.m.
