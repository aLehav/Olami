Despite a national lag in U.S. Postal Service use, many USC students said they still use the service when they want to communicate in a more personal way.
You’ve got mail · Mail Stop Supervisor Lilly Alvarez and Customer Services Representative Vanessa Anguiano prepare to mail a package. - Engie Salama | Daily Trojan
The service currently operates on a $8.37 billion deficit, according to the Annual Report of Postmaster General. Pieces of mail handled has dropped 22 percent since its highest recent level of use in 2000.
Members of the four unions affiliated with the U.S. Postal Service are rallying around the country today from 4 p.m. to 5:30 p.m. to encourage Congress members to end the mandate that forces the service to pre-fund pensions. Cutting this mandate will reduce $5 billion in annual cost.
The USC Mail Stop has not experienced a significant decrease in usage, according to Lilly Alvarez, its supervisor. The USC Mail Stop is located in Parking Structure X and offers all services a postal office would, in addition to those offered by UPS and FedEx.
Alvarez said the Mail Stop has consistently seen high demand because people value using mail as a more personal medium of communication.
“Packages deliver a bond with face-to-face communication instead of something electronic,” Alvarez said. “For example, on Valentine’s Day, new students especially will receive care packages [sponsored by USC] from their parents.”
Alvarez also said the private shipping services offered at the Mail Stop can be used by students if the federal postal service isn’t available.
Students said they still use mail to connect with friends and family.
Tricia Nguyen, a freshman majoring in biological sciences, said she mails gifts and letters to friends and family on the East Coast.
“You can’t send something physical like a sweater over the Internet,” Nguyen said.
Mazie Wong, a freshman majoring in business administration, said she uses mail to keep in touch with friends at other colleges.
“We’re doing a notebook that gets passed around,” Wong said. “We each write in it and it gets passed along until it’s a full circle.”
Students whose families and friends live nearby can see each other more easily, so they tend to not use the service as much.
Adam Syed, an undeclared freshman, said he only sends mail once or twice a year because most of his family and friends live in Pasadena.
“When I want to keep in touch with friends from high school, I just use Facebook,” Syed said. “It’s a lot easier than sending a letter.”
Joel Kutz, a sophomore from Pennsylvania majoring in screenwriting, said he uses the mail to stay close to his family.
“It’s difficult going to school 3,000 miles away from home, but being able to send letters and packages really closes that gap,” Kutz said. “There’s something about a physical letter that makes you feel much more connected than you do through email.”

Though national SAT scores were the lowest on record this year, according to College Board, USC’s median scores for the incoming freshman class rose 20 points, making the middle 50 percent of scores between 1970 and 2180, according to the Freshman Profile and Admission Information 2011-2012.
The national average for the SAT was 1500, down six points from last year.
The downward trend affected each section of the SAT test, with averages dropping three points in reading, one point in math and two in writing. Critical reading scores were the lowest on record.
Dean of Admission Timothy Brunold said the drop in scores might be attributed to a decreased emphasis on SAT scores in the college admissions process, including at USC.
“Test scores are neither the primary quantitative factor we consider, nor are they the most predictive quantitative factor used,” Brunold said.
Michael Fox, a senior majoring in international relations, said SATs are a good tool for comparing students, but should not be the determining factor of admissions.
“For someone who is aspiring to be something, a test is an objective way of placing you against your peer but at the end of the day, it is just a number,” Fox said.
Brunold said any increase in the university’s median SAT score was incidental.
“Each year we don’t specifically set out to increase the average SAT score of the incoming class, but these constant increases are primarily a reflection of USC’s ability to attract very capable students,” Brunold said.
Brunold said a strong high school grade point average and extracurriculars are a more accurate predictor of success for admitted students.
“Our studies confirm that test score results can help us predict how a student might perform academically at USC,” Brunold said. “But they are most valid when used with many other factors, most notably high school [GPA] and strength of high school.”
 
Correction: A previous version of this article incorrectly stated the middle 50 percent SAT range of the enrolled freshman class was between 1750 and 2100. The actual range is between 1970 and 2180.

USC Graduate Professional Student Senate will announce the launch of a new program today that will allow graduate students to check out iPads from Leavey Library  starting in spring 2012.
The program is expected to help graduate students remain competitive in the job market, Jaclyn Selby, GPSS director of academic affairs, said in an email.
For graduate students to remain competitive in this job market, it’s helpful for them to be able to have access to an iPad for even a short time to be able to explore new applications in their respective fields, or to test out new teaching methods in the classroom,” Selby said.
Selby said the iPads will benefit undergraduate students who have graduate students as teaching assistants.
“Having even a few of these iPads available for check-out could have some tremendous benefits to graduate students on campus, and indirectly to the undergraduates for whom they are TAs,” Selby said.
Some students, including Zach Cianci, a freshman majoring in business administration, are not convinced the iPads will be useful or worthwhile.
“It just doesn’t seem practical,” Cianci said. “Students would have to either have an iPad or an Apple laptop to transfer everything.”
Ekaansh Anand, a graduate student studying computer science, said she will probably not use the iPads, though she sees them as beneficial for graduate students.
“I probably wouldn’t use this unless I forgot my own laptop, but this is a privilege earned by graduate students,” Anand said.
No decision has yet been made regarding how long students will be able to check out iPads, nor regarding whether additional libraries will offer the service.
GPSS will host a digital graduate student multimedia tools workshop to inform students about technology available to graduate students today at 1 p.m. at the Forum in the Ronald Tutor Campus Center.
I’m the Executive Director of Communications and Public Programming for the USC Libraries, and I just thought I’d comment to clarify a couple points about this great pilot project with GPSS.
This semester, the project is focused on the testing that’s underway with several students who are evaluating the usefulness of tablets and app-based research. Any eventual check-out program—and to be clear, the project is looking at checking out a modest number of tablets rather than renting them out for payment—is pending the successful completion of the current evaluation phase.
I’d also like to note this project’s role in supporting the broader goal of helping students engage as productively as possible with library collections and services. From that perspective, today’s GPSS workshop on all the digital research tools available—not just tablets or any other specific technology—is also an important part of the story.
Thanks very much.

For many, it’s hard to see Saturday’s thrashing as anything other than a deflating punch to the gut for the Trojans.
The great 3-0 start, a bunch of young talent proving its worth early on and a group of veteran leaders showing that it is ready to take the reins — it all seemed irrelevant once USC’s game against the Sun Devils hit the books.
It’s not that a defeat this season was unexpected; rather, it’s the manner in which the Trojans went about being force-fed a tally in the loss column.
From the opening drive, Arizona State kept a stranglehold on the game’s momentum and rhythm, using a combination of shifty running and stifling defense to jump to a sizable lead.
Even when the Trojans got back on track in the third quarter, the Sun Devils stayed focused and stuck to their guns, effectively snuffing out any chance of a comeback.
The nightmares of 2010 were reimagined for USC, as the defensive play was only rivaled in ineffectiveness by junior quarterback Matt Barkley’s poor decision-making and careless passes.
By the end of the game, it was clear the young Trojans weren’t fully prepared to take their at-home success on the road.
But I am a firm believer that most losses can offer some sort of silver lining, and while the defeat certainly isn’t a “moral victory” or anything of the sort, it’s not impossible to see that routs like this might help USC in the one area it needs significant work — growing up.
The environment at Sun Devil Stadium in Tempe, Ariz., was by no means friendly, and USC bore the brunt of some unfortunate — and downright odd — circumstances.
A 70-yard touchdown scamper by Arizona State junior running back Cameron Marshall on the fourth play of the game — made possible by some shoddy tackling on USC’s behalf — got the home crowd roaring, and put the Trojans in the worst position possible for their first road test. The team was down 7-0 headed into its opening possession.
After the impressive display of celebratory fireworks settled, a massive dust storm complete with rain and a hail of maroon pom-poms tore through the stadium just as USC started on offense.
The conditions were not only unexpected, but incredibly difficult to play in; combined with the lack of momentum, a loud crowd and an early deficit, it seemed there wasn’t much more that could go wrong for USC.
It was a trial by fire and the Trojans got burned.
It’s been said a thousand times that this isn’t the same team as last decade.
The new Trojans are good, but they are battling inexperience  holding them back in every area of their game.
Though a road test — and the atmosphere that comes with it — wouldn’t have been an excuse for the old Trojans to falter, it is unreasonable to expect the same of the current team, which is one of the youngest squads in the Pac-12.
By no means can the loss be blamed on the external conditions of the game.
But to have gone through the ringer early on and still be able to come out of halftime with enough juice left in the tank to take the lead was an experience that will benefit the Trojans going forward.
The quality of USC’s play will ultimately determine its record at season’s end, but having the wherewithal to ignore other factors that can rattle a squad will improve the team’s chances of playing to its potential. Saturday’s game highlighted some gaping flaws in the USC game plan.
But it also provided an opportunity for the team to gain some experience in an incredibly difficult scenario, which is highly valuable considering it currently has very little experience.
USC can compete with any team in the Pac-12 if it plays to its strengths.
Doing that at home is a challenge, but it’s entirely different to do it on the road.
Though there is no doubt that Oregon, Notre Dame and California will come close to matching the hostility the Trojans dealt with in Tempe, Ariz., USC now has a stepping stone to use to take its game to the next level.
For now at least, after its nightmare in Tempe, Ariz., that’s all the Trojans can hope for.

Former USC secondary coach Willie Mack Garza wired $1,500 to Houston-based talent scout Willie Lyles in July 2009 while he was an assistant under USC coach Lane Kiffin at the University of Tennessee, Yahoo! Sports reported Monday night.
Stepped down · Former USC secondary coach Willie Mack Garza (left) resigned from his position on Sept. 1, citing personal reasons. He also served on Lane Kiffin’s staff at Tennessee from December 2008 to January 2010. - Carlo Acenas | Daily Trojan
The money, which was wired via MoneyGram to Lyles, was used to pay for plane tickets for an unofficial recruiting made by five-star running back recruit Lache Seastrunk, who was mentored by Lyles, and his mother, Evelyn, to Knoxville, Tenn., June 20-to-21, 2009.
An additional $76 processing fee was also charged to Lyles, according to the report.
Garza, who served on Kiffin’s staff at USC during the 2010 season, resigned as the team’s secondary coach Sept. 1, citing personal issues.
“I have some personal issues unrelated to USC that I need to address,” Garza said in a statement at the time. “I wish the Trojans the best and I am sorry I won’t be with them in what I know will be a very successful season.”
Lyles spoke with NCAA investigators Aug. 30 in Los Angeles, where he disclosed his relationship with Lyles, according to reports appearing in CBS Sports and SportsbyBrooks at the time.
Under NCAA rules, players are required to pay for all transportation costs while on unofficial visits, and Garza’s actions constituted a violation as a result. Players are barred from making any “official” visits until they begin their senior academic year of high school, and Seastrunk, at the time, had just completed his junior year at Temple High School in Temple, Texas.
Yahoo! Sports obtained an independent receipt of the transaction, which lists “Willie Garza” as the sender and “Will Lyles” as the recipient.
Tennessee wrapped up a case with the NCAA last month after it upheld the program’s self-imposed sanctions after the conclusion of a 22-month investigation into the football program under Kiffin and men’s basketball program under Bruce Pearl. The athletic department is currently one month into its two-year probationary period.
“We are aware of the situation as is the conference office,” Tennessee associate athletic director for communications Jimmy Stanton said in a statement released Monday. “We’ve been verbally contacted by the NCAA enforcement staff regarding a recruiting issue in 2009 related to the former coaching staff and a student-athlete who never attended Tennessee.”
A repeat offense, however, could carry stiffer penalties.
When speaking with Yahoo!, Lyles detailed how the incident with Garza came about.
“[Garza called] and he says ‘Hey, how are you doing. I’m Coach Garza. I recruit the state of Texas for Tennessee. We need to talk about Lache Seastrunk getting here on an unofficial visit,’” Lyles said. “And I said ‘OK.’ I told them that I would let Evelyn [Seastrunk] know. When I told her about it, she said ‘That’s cool.’”
Kiffin’s involvement was not mentioned in the report. Whether there will be any further repercussions is unknown.

Senior Steve Johnson, who is taking this fall semester off to play in the USTA Pro Circuit, won two USTA Futures titles in consecutive weeks.
Unstoppable · USC senior Steve Johnson, who tallied a 48-3 record last season, finished atop the ITA/Campbell National Rankings in 2010-2011. - Mannat Saini | Daily Trojan
The reigning NCAA singles champion and leader of the USC men’s tennis team seeking its fourth straight NCAA championship title this spring has transitioned seamlessly to the professional ranks.
In winning his second Futures title last weekend, Johnson has now rattled off a streak of 10 consecutive match wins and 20 straight set wins, sweeping New Zealand’s Artem Sitak in straight sets, 6-3, 6-3, in the final of the Costa Mesa Pro Classic on Sunday.
The 2011 Campbell/ITA Player of the Year has not lost a set since dropping the first set of a first round match against Kyle McMorrow at the Pomona Valley Hospital Medical Center Pro Classic on Sept. 14.
Johnson’s recent surge has earned him an accompanying rise in the ATP World Tour rankings, as he now stands at No. 471, an increase of 60 spots from his previous ranking.

It started just the way it ended.
Fresh off its third consecutive NCAA championship, the No. 1 USC’s men’s tennis team showed no signs of slowing down.
Last weekend, the Trojans kicked off their season at the Fall Chowder Fest in Cambridge, Mass., facing No. 72 Harvard, No. 34 Michigan and No. 10 Texas A&M over the span of three days of singles and doubles matches.
Promise · Sophomore Ray Sarmiento, who earned All-American honors last season, teamed with current senior Steve Johnson to win the 2011 Pac-10 Doubles Championship. - Mannat Saini | Daily Trojan
For the first time since 2007, USC began a season without NCAA singles champion senior Steve Johnson, who chose to forgo the fall semester to go through professional training after finishing No. 1 in Intercollegiate Tennis Association rankings last year.
The Trojans did not miss a beat, though.
Four players swept 3-0 during singles play at Harvard, during the weekend including No. 15 sophomore Ray Sarmiento, No. 66 senior Emilio Gomez, sophomore Michael Grant and freshman Yannick Hanfmann.
Hanfmann received the Corey Wynn ’40 Freshman of the Tournament award for his play.
“It’s the guys getting comfortable playing the tennis I want them to play in pressure situations,” USC coach Peter Smith said. “All the younger guys need to feel more confident and comfortable, and it was a good start.”
No. 16 senior Daniel Nguyen defeated No. 78 Jonathan Perlman of Harvard Friday in a 6-1, 6-0 victory. Nguyen’s sole singles loss of the weekend came in a 3-6, 1-6 defeat Saturday to No. 8 junior Evan King of Michigan, who received the Dale Junta ’58 Winner award for going undefeated in the invitational.
Freshmen Eric Johnson and Jonny Wang each finished with 2-1 singles records in their first collegiate competitions.
“We had four guys that had never played for NCAA,” Smith said. “It was an individual tournament, but it had the appearance of a school match, and that was good for them.”
Though the Trojans fared well in singles matches, they struggled in doubles play, when on day one, they went 1-3.
The Trojans ultimately finished with a 5-6 doubles record for the invitational.
“Doubles is always a concern,” Smith said. “It showed us that we got to work on doubles on a daily basis. When you start having four teams beat you, then it’s pretty obvious.”
But the team’s seven-hour wait at Los Angeles International Airport and a long flight across the country might have contributed to the doubles woes on day one.
Nonetheless, the coaching staff remained pleased with the players’ performances during opening weekend.
“We got there and weren’t even able to warm up,” Smith said. “I was really happy with my team’s effort on that, but we definitely need to work on doubles. [The invitational] showed we have a lot to work on, but it also showed we have a lot to work with.”
The Trojans are set to travel east to Tulsa, Okla., Monday, where Nguyen, along with, Sarmiento will participate in the singles main draw as part of the ITA Men’s All-American Qualifying.
Hanfmann and Gomez will also play in the singles qualifying draw for the seven-day ITA Men’s All-American Championships.

The stressors of college, in and out of the classroom, make it difficult to stay energized.
It was especially true for me, juggling midterms, papers, class, homework and work. Sleep wasn’t really an option. And this isn’t an uncommon situation, and in many cases, it can be worse.
A nonlethal but unhealthy mix of inactivity, stress without rest and poor eating habits can drain the body’s energy, sap strength and mental sharpness and stop any sort of fat loss path the body may be on.
So, is there any alternative? Busy schedules can’t be avoided, but there are some quick and easy remedies that can help keep the body fit and the mind sharp.
Start the morning off with exercise
Mornings are rough, and there is nothing more satisfying than hitting the snooze button before taking a lazy start to the day. But, for the benefit of a healthier body and a greater supply of energy throughout the day, a few quick exercises within 30 minutes of waking up make all the difference.
While sleeping, the body’s muscles tend to contract. Soon after waking up, stretch the entire body. Roll each leg at the hip, forward and back. Roll the neck carefully. Pull your arms across your chest. Work everything from shoulders to elbows to wrists.
For added fun, follow it up with some quick exercise. A mix of 20 push-ups and 30 crunches is my preference, but it’s up to the individual. Just remember: do them quickly after waking. This is the best way to increase circulation and get the muscles working at their fullest.
Find natural foods to avoid crashing
It might not sound fulfilling, but foods like carrots and almonds can offer energy through means other than sugar, such as high nutrient levels.
If you have the time for a full breakfast, avoid carb-heavy cereals or grain. Instead, load up on fresh food. It might not be as filling, but expect a longer state of alertness. Buy a blender, throw fruits, vegetables and nuts in and drink on the go — instant energy.
Embrace the cold
Cold therapy is one of the most beneficial, unorthodox tips — and one of my favorites — thanks to the sheer number of health benefits it has. A cold shower can burn fat because of the way cold temperatures activate fat-burning cells in the body, but it also has other tricks, namely in the energy-boosting field.
Cold can increase circulation, as it pushes blood through the vessels around the body. Plus, it can be a very good way to wake up following a near all-nighter.
Train your body’s reflexes
Sitting in a chair for hours on end, and pouring over books and computers will likely restrict physical activity to arm movement and typing. When forced into a routine, the body adapts to it, and if that routine is lethargy, then that’s what the body’s reflexes will adapt to.
This might not seem like much, but reflexes are tied to alertness and reaction time and can be useful in dodging bike traffic, making sharp turns in a crowd and simply taking in all that’s going on around campus.
Even if the plan is to spend eight hours at your desk finishing a midterm assignment, make sure to set aside 10-15 minutes to exercise. This doesn’t mean going to the gym; it can be done inside your dorm or apartment. Find a bit of space and start doing a variety of exercises, rotating between them constantly.
These can be push-ups, jumping and bringing the knees to your chest, then launching immediately into sit-ups. Basically, do many exercises, but in very short sets, and alternate the muscles being used. This mix forces the body to move from muscle group to muscle group, never allowing it to adjust and settle.
All-nighters can deaden the body and the mind; by training your reflexes, you can help give it more energy and make yourself more alert.
Nothing will top a full workout and a long sleep for physical benefits, but one shouldn’t give up on fitness because of midterms or a hectic schedule. With a few quick tricks, the body can stay active and energetic, no matter how busy things get.

Exercise is beneficial to the body. An early morning exercise can boost energy for the whole day. As part of the daily routine exercise will keep you physically  fit and healthy.

The new musical comedy at Pasadena Playhouse may be named after South Street, the famous touristy district in Philadelphia known for its colorful night scene and eclectic air, but what it delivers is a promising production mired by a bland script and flat story.
Redemptive people · Despite the musical’s haphazard presentation of themes, deflated plot structure and a handful of spotty, lackluster numbers, the brand-new musical comedy South Street is held together by the production’s solid and passionate cast. - Photo courtesy of The Pasadena Playhouse
Set in the late 20th century at a time when scrunchies and neon leggings were the rage, South Street — music and lyrics by Richard Addrisi, book by Craig Carlisle and direction by Roger Castellano — tells the tales of a South Street bar called Sammy’s Place.
Sammy’s Place is more than a bar; it is an historic fixture that evolved from a firehouse to a strip joint (The Brass Pole) to a local favorite hangout spot that hosts the popular annual Full Moon Festival, created by owner Sammy as a celebration of good times with friends old and new.
It is also home to an unconventional “family:” Sammy (Tom Shelton) and his smart-mouthed wife Sybil (Valerie Perri); Sammy’s good friends, hearty Lou (Harrison White) and polyester-donning Arnie (Ezra Buzzington); and the newest addition, the vagabond siblings Cloe (Maria Eberline) and Norton (Matthew Patrick Davis and Andy Scott Harris as young Norton).
The musical begins in 1997 with Cloe getting ready for the Full Moon Festival.
Things have changed since she first auditioned for a pole-dancing gig at Sammy’s Place 17 years ago. It’s been a year since Sammy passed away and left his club to Cloe, who is now a single mother to a teenage daughter named Crystal (Cassie Silva).
A flashback to 1980 reveals Crystal is born from an old affair with the club’s pianist Johnny (Brent Schindele), who doesn’t know about his daughter and has since left town to pursue his rock‘n’roll career.
Though the themes of friendship and love are predictable and simple, the plot hops all over the place; there’s no definite “hook” to the story.
The main plotline seems to be about the threat against Cloe’s ownership of Sammy’s Place when she gets served a boxful of IOUs by two hooligan brothers who plan to eradicate the club’s longstanding traditions — and rename it Booby Bar and Deli (“For hot girls and coleslaw!”).
But then it also seems to be about the romance between Cloe and Johnny. The play, however, doesn’t invest enough time into the personal intricacies of the characters for the audience to care.
In fact, the first act seems to jump between several minor scenes instead of following one major cohesive thread.
One moment, it’s Johnny flirtatiously coaxing Cloe to smile for him (“Say Cheese”); the next, it’s Sammy and Lou dancing to their friendship (“Best of Friends”). Soon Sammy holds the first Full Moon Festival and toasts to the rabbit in the moon, symbolizing the magic of life, and then suddenly Johnny’s gone on a music road trip and Cloe is ignoring his calls.
Too many characters and subplots are squeezed into a single act, as well as a couple of numbers seem completely unnecessary. That could slide by if the tunes were catchy and the choreography dazzling, but neither is original or tantalizing enough to keep the audience from wondering when the curtain will close for intermission.
Thankfully, both song and dance heat up by the second act. One of the best scenes is the dance competition during the 1997 Full Moon Festival, in which three couples dance it out in sultry tango or zippy swing, earning delighted hoots and whistles from the audience.
Specifically, the number “Cool Dad,” performed by Crystal and her friends (Jacqueline Nguyen and Hannah Simmons), is fun and spunky, capturing the awkwardness of teenage years with cheesy yet exuberant choreography and tunes.
Despite the contrived storylines and a few lackluster numbers, the South Street cast is brilliant in its talents and passion. Every cast member has a distinct voice and charm, projecting as much personality as possible within the limited script. The lines and lyrics may be corny, but the cast shines through with enough hilarious one-liners to keep the audience entertained.
The set by Andy Walmsley is beautiful, reminiscent of the bohemian atmosphere of Philadelphia’s South Street, and the vibrant costumes by Kate Bergh draw nostalgia for those early decades of leg warmers and bushy side ponytails.
South Street might not be destined for Broadway, but like the Philly charm, it’s got its own lovely soul and flavor. At the very least, the musical will destine a jovial night of entertaining fun.

How far would you go for chocolate? Would you battle the mid-day traffic, stand in winding lines and be content with a small taste of victory and mellifluous flavors to start your holiday shopping now? If so, then the 5th Annual Los Angeles Luxury Chocolate Salon was the ultimate test of a chocolate lover’s devotion.
Crowded taste · The 5th Annual Los Angeles Luxury Chocolate Salon was stocked with chocolate, toffee and caramel displays, so much so that the event erred on overwhelmingness, but the samples proved enticing. - Mimi Honeycutt | Daily Trojan
The Los Angeles Luxury Chocolate Salon is a celebration of all things chocolate, toffee and caramel. Sporting vendors including the award-winning Jer’s Chocolate, CocoTutti and Butterfly Brittle, it seems like a cacao-dusted paradise.
For $30 at-the-door tickets and $9 for parking, guests have unlimited access to all things chocolate.
Tables with samples of chocolate bars, brittles, caramels, wine and even tequila encircled a ballroom at the newly-renovated Pasadena Center on Green Street.
A cooking demonstration commenced on one side of the room. A recipe for strawberry trifle was taught by master chef and chocolatier Ed Engoron, who recently published a dessert recipe book called Choclatique.
“I hope to show people easy ways to make desserts and how to eat really great chocolate,” Engoron said.
His company, also called Choclatique, crafts more than 250 flavors of chocolate truffle, with interesting flavors like Caramel Corn and Margarita Madness. After Engoran, other speakers took the stage. Author and foodie Lucy Lean introduced her new cookbook, Made in America: Our Best Chefs Reinvent Comfort Food, where pictures of duck-fat-fried chicken and spicy ginger whoopie pies had attendees drooling.
Yet this chocolate event is less a salon and more a shivaree. Despite the abundance of chocolate stands, lines stacked up and wound around other tables. Wait-times never quite reached Disneyland proportions, but it was enough to give the atmosphere an edge of frenzy.
After conquering the line, samples were freely given, albeit in pinky-nail sizes. Thank goodness chocolate stimulates happy hormones or it might have been a bloodbath. Yet for most chocolate lovers, the lines were not a deterrent. Hearing about the salon from meetup.com, attendee Glacel Salagan just knew it was about chocolate.
“It’s my first time so I didn’t know what to expect,” Salagan said. “But I like the fact that it’s a chocolate and wine tasting — I love chocolate.”
A couple of companies, however, were not as enthusiastic about handing out free samples. They soon felt the weight of neglect when all the other booths had lines to rival Magic Mountain. For Frederik Sisa and many others, the samples were a key draw.
“I come for a love of chocolate, and all of its flavors and manifestations,” Sisa said. “If you can try it and decide if you like it or not, you reduce the risk you’re not going to like it and waste your money.”
At its heart, the salon was a showcase of the artisans in the chocolate industry. Chocolatier Art Pollard, whose company Amano Artisan Chocolate has earned more than 100 awards since 2007, has a simple recipe for the most enticing chocolate.
“In the end it’s all about flavor,” Pollard said. “It’s all about using the very best quality ingredients. So, I travel all around the world and work with different farmers and help them improve their processes. And we get some of the finest quality chocolate in the world.”
Though Amano is best known for its Madagascar chocolate, Pollard’s personal favorite comes from Chuao, a little village in Venezuela that can only be reached by fishing boat.
Gourmet chocolate is not irreconcilable with helping the world either. According to Josh Handy, with Pacari Ecuadorian Organic Chocolate, keeping farms small and sustainable makes for even better chocolate.
“One of the main things we are doing is buying from small family farms and encouraging permaculture (the development of agricultural ecosystems intended to be sustainable and self-sufficient),” Handy said.
Pacari encourages farmers to utilize old growth instead of planting new trees, and to allow other plants to shade the cacao. This makes the land habitable for the farmers and improves the chocolate flavors.
Recently, Pacari also developed raw chocolate bars to better illustrate the flavor of cacao. When vegan raw foodists showed an interest, Pacari began adding superfoods, like maca powder, to certain bars. The bars have proved to be a unique success.
“I think the gourmet chocolate market is bigger but we’re getting so much interest in the raw chocolate market and the sustainability that I think it’s an emerging market that could very well outpace the gourmet market,” Handy said.
For the average person, the complexities and political ramifications of cocoa come after that of taste and comfort. The lines of people waiting for a smidgen of chocolate-y goodness prove it. Mother-and-daughter team Daphne and Amanda Ormerod, owners of Bootleg Chocolate, understand why some cannot resist good chocolate.
“Even if the economy’s bad or whatever else is going on, you can afford a little piece of really good chocolate,” Daphne Ormerod said. “It makes you feel really good.”
Thanks for your comments on my trifle presentation.  One thing I would like to say is that at events where Choclatique shows their chocolate such as this we never cut our truffles and NEVER run out of chocolate samples.  At this weekend’s event we gave away over 6000 pieces of chocolate.  We do understand that people have paid an admission and we want to give them the best bang for their buck.  After all that’s how we make new friends and devotees for Choclatique.

The AMBULANTE Film Festival, which made its American debut in Los Angeles, is not the average festival. AMBULANTE’s American appearance spanned two days (Saturday and Sunday) and included two films per day.
Diego Luna — actor, director and co-creator of AMBULANTE — stressed AMBULANTE’s excitement and intrigue.
“[AMBULANTE] is more of a tour,” Luna said. “More like a rock tour.”
“Ambulante” in English means “peddler,” and that’s just what the festival is. Traveling around for three months, the film festival typically stays for a week in each state in Mexico. Over the weekend, the festival paid a special visit to Los Angeles.
As Ricardo Giraldo, director of the AMBULANTE Film Festival, said, “We project on walls, in plazas, churches, prisons as well as commercial cinemas.”
Projecting on walls? That’s already a far cry away from the glitz and glamour of other festivals like Cannes and Sundance.
AMBULANTE is also rare in that the films are not shown in competition with one another and are instead a cultural collection put together simply for the purpose of enjoying art — and in the case of Los Angeles, foreign, cultural art.
In addition to these oddities, AMBULANTE does not show fiction films; instead, the festival only opts for documentaries, allowing viewers to encounter stories from around the world.
Touching on the large population of Mexicans living in Los Angeles, Luna said, “It makes total sense to be here.”
USC seemed like a natural choice as well; after speaking with Luna, Annenberg Professor Josh Kun worked with Visions and Voices and AMBULANTE’s organizers to bring the Mexican festival here for its American debut.
The festival’s first film, The Two Escobars, directed by Jeff and Michael Zimbalist, served as the perfect cultural introduction.
This heart-pounding thriller dives into the world of narco-soccer (the juxtaposition of drug money and soccer) in Colombia in the ’80s and ’90s. The Two Escobars tells the story of Pablo Escobar, a famous drug trafficker and murderer, and Andrés Escobar, a star member of the Colombian national soccer team.
The film is a fascinating commentary on a lifestyle so different from those of Americans or American residents. The film insinuates that sports in the United States are reserved for those ardent fans, while in Colombia, everyone is a fan and a lost game is the end of the world.
Michael Zimbalist followed, discussing how the film’s fascinating subject and story made him and his brother initiate the project.
2010’s Benda Bilili!, directed by Renaud Barret and Florent de la Tullaye, was another of the film festival’s highlights.
Telling the story of a group of disabled seniors coming together to make a band in the Congo, Benda Bilili! is the ultimate symbol of light in a world of darkness.
And although the underdog film sounds hackneyed, one can’t help but root for the seniors in the end.
The second day’s festivities commenced with a panel discussion, “Documentaries Without Borders,” where Josh Kun, Diego Luna, Michael Zimbalist, Lucas Marcheggiano and Florent de la Tullay discussed topics such as the evolution of the documentary, the fiction adoption of the “documentary-style” and the importance of Mexicans viewing their own stories. The panel was successful in that it showed the significance of cinematic media’s ever-changing approaches to crafting stories and the rewards of embracing a culture’s history.
Next screened was a film from 2009, El Ambulante, directed by Eduardo de la Serna, Lucas Marcheggiano and Adriana Yurcovich.
The movie follows filmmaker Daniel Burmeister, who traveled from village to village in Argentina and offered to make a movie with Argentinian townspeople, free of charge (in exchange for room and board). Attendees ate El Ambulante up.
The festival ended on a poignant note with a screening of Tatiana Huezo’s El Lugar Más Pequeño, introduced by Ricardo Giraldo as “something close to a masterpiece.”
Covering the civil war that plagued El Salvador, the film captured the darkness within a village called Cinquera. Haunting, beautiful, startling and all things in between, El Lugar Más Pequéno helped the audience see the harsh realities of the world, such as kidnapping, murder, disabilities and homelessness.
Yet the tenacity to not give up remains in the film.
As Andrés Escobar says right before his murder: “Life doesn’t end here.”
[…] The festival was also featured in the USC Daily Trojan. […]

Recently, there has been much debate over a possible smoking ban on campus. The implementation of such a ban has the potential to raise USC’s prestige as a progressive university committed not only to debate and discussion, but also to action and implementation.
As a private university, USC has greater jurisdiction over such matters than a public school would, and therefore it can potentially be seen as a role model for reforms and improvements throughout California’s higher education system.
Esther Cheong | Daily Trojan
The issue being addressed is not necessarily smoking itself. Smoking bans, to a certain degree, are already in place around campus.
Extending these bans would not be introducing any new idea. Logistically speaking, the implementation of a complete ban would not be overly difficult to enforce. Further extending the smoking bans already in place would entail more symbolic value than practical consequence.
By joining more than 530 other colleges who have banned smoking, USC would recognize itself not just as a university with the interest of its students’ health and well-being in mind, but a university that truly acts on that notion.
USC would join schools such as Stanford University’s Medical School and University of California, San Francisco in taking tangible steps to promote healthy lifestyles.
By implementing a complete smoking ban, USC would challenge some of the rights smokers claim. Non-smokers, however, could make similar claims regarding their rights to clean airspace.
Banning or not banning smoking will affect the student body, and people will disagree — no matter the decision. But rather than concentrate on what people want or don’t want, USC should focus on innovation, setting an example and being truly committed to student health.
Banning smoking is clearly a step toward a healthier campus. It would be repetitive to outline the extensive list of negative effects of smoking, for these facts have been familiar to all of us since we were young.
I highly doubt anyone will argue secondhand smoking is good for those who experience it. Smoking is bad for your health, regardless if people should be permitted to do it or not — and that’s the issue at hand.
If the ban were to occur, it would likely be met with opposition as it would make one lifestyle choice inconvenient. But certain times, like right now, students must ask themselves if they support the statements and examples USC is trying to implement and portray. If this ban is not supported, it could shine a negative light on USC.
Visitors come to campus and make judgments based on first impressions. If visitors, prospective students or parents see the university making tangible efforts to create a healthy and safe environment for students, the university will be seen as an example of responsibility and dedication.
While on campus, students and their actions reflect on the university. The support of such a ban or similar restrictions, by smokers and non-smokers alike, would magnify USC’s prestige as a progressive university.
Personal sacrifice for common interest is oftentimes the best solution.

Truth and lies about second smoke not withstanding….
 When it comes right down to it smokers inhale hot gas with melted tar and thousands of chemicals.
Other people may find the smoke irritating and uncomfortable, so if it is to be regulated then what standard should prevail? Certainly not the standard of choice as smokers have proven that they cannot be trusted (as a group) to protect the comfort of others by refraining from smoking in public places.  I see smokers puffing away every day in an outdoor space with “no smoking” signs posted everywhere.
So then it has to be the standard of clean air which is a standard that benefits all of us even smokers.  In other words this is the standard that brings about the most good for the most people.
What I do not understand is why (some) smokers think that this standard is one that should not be enforced?
There has to be a balance between bans and freedom of choice surely. Having been a smoker for years, I didn’t like non-smokers professing to me all the time about smoking. Although I don’t smoke anymore (as I use electronic cigarettes instead) which you can use anywhere, surely the people who have an addiction have some rights. The government doesn’t mind taking the taxes off these people anyway. If you want to find out more about electronic cigarettes, go to: http://www.e-smokereviews.com for advice, tips and honest reviews.
I would disagree that a smoking ban is “progressive.”
I’m not part of the USC community, however, since your ban is almost certainly spurred and encouraged by forces and money far beyond the USC community, I hope you won’t mind my input.
The issue was being discussed a month or two ago and the University offered a “Smoke Free Forum” to discuss the issue with key administrators with free food provided.  If the students against a ban wished to host a “Free Choice Forum” for students to discuss the issue with key administrators, would that receive the same level of support — including free food? Somehow I have doubts about how neutral that “Forum” was.
Second, “joining 530 colleges and universities” sounds like an excellent example of the “Bandwagon Argument” until you realize that it represents only about ten percent of the total in the U.S.  The argument of “Everyone ELSE is jumping off the bridge, why shouldn’t I?” should have been left in grammar school.
Third, in terms of outdoor smoking harming anyone besides the smoker, please see my comments at the earlier Trojan article: http://dailytrojan.com/2011/04/10/smoke-free-campus-must-become-reality/
And finally, for anyone wanting to question the basis of such a ban, you might want to read and share a copy of “The Lies Behind The Smoking Bans” at: http://kuneman.smokersclub.com/PASAN/StilettoGenv5h.pdf
If anyone has any specific, substantive criticisms of anything in “The Lies…” please feel free to share them here. I’ll try to stop back.
Michael J. McFadden, whose competing interest you'[ll evidently just have to Google.
I”m not sure being identified as a “progressive university environment” is good for USC. This institution’s reputation is one of entrepreneurialism, self-reliance and trend-setting independence from the common herd. I don’t smoke and I can’t stand the smell of cigarettes. Still, don’t I think putting limits on student’s freedoms is the way to advance USC’s reputation or to attract better students and faculty.
“Progressive” you people on the left keep using that word; I do not think it means what you think it does.
Just in case you haven’t been paying attention to the news, personal responsibility and individual liberty are once again on the ascendancy.  
Let’s make a deal: you stay out of our lives and we’ll stay out of yours, kapish?
Conversely, if you absolutely insist on attending a college with a big brother, totalitarian tilt, I’d like to direct you to either the 405 N (exit Westwood Ave) or the 101 N (exit Left on Berkeley Drive).
Fight on!
When my father was 21, he was a young college student who was also physically active.  I’m certain he could run a 5-minute mile a bit faster than most other people at his school.  He also smoked.  Dad says he liked the way it tasted, the way it made him feel, and he looked cool doing it.
He’s now 70 years old.  He’s been on oxygen for the last 8 years, fights for each and every breathe, grabbing the nebulizer after even the slightest bit of exertion.  It is a sad way to go. and I wouldn’t wish it on my worst enemy.  The only pleasure he gets is from few puffs he can draw from his Marboro.  He still likes the way it makes him feel, but it’s no longer so cool.
While the university does have the right to regulate smoking on its own property, outdoors smoking bans are really just unecessary government overreach. Electronic cigarettes are increasingly popular and accepted now. I’ve tried several brands to avoid odor, save money and enjoy almost anywhere, so see http://www.ecigwerks.blogspot.com for more.
I like smoking. I like the way it tastes, the way it looks, and the way it makes me feel. Shockingly, I also remain physically active and suffer no apparent ill effects from it—I don’t cough, and I’m fairly certain that my five-minute mile is quite a bit faster than most other people at USC.
The author is correct; if USC bans smoking, it is sending a message to the world. Whether that message is one of “prestige as a progressive university” is of little consequence to me. In my mind, an institution that seeks to control people’s free, legitimate, and legal activities does not convey the element of trust that higher education ought to embody. If people want designated smoking areas, fine. But to ban smoking because it harms other people’s health is ridiculous. Secondhand smoke is far less harmful than any number of activities that these campaigners engage in on a regular basis, and they sound ignorant and ill-informed when they loudly proclaim its negative impact on their wellbeing.
Grow up, people. Take some responsibility for yourselves, and don’t rely on a “progressive” university environment to do it for you.
And for God’s sake, next time you’re in France, at least try a puff of a Gauloise. You might be surprised by it.
“Shockingly, I also remain physically active and suffer no apparent ill effects from it”
Yeah, that’s what a lot of people think. Even my brother. Too bad you don’t get cancer/COPD/some smoking-related illness overnight, so you can’t regret it until you’re a few decades down the line. Do some research. Read about the diseases smoking causes or indirectly causes. Take responsibility for your health. And please don’t be bought by the tobacco industry. You like the way it looks. HONESTLY, even elementary school students are judging you.

The United States 2012 elections are quickly approaching. Once again, young Americans have the ability to choose the country’s leaders and define the contours of this nation — a right those in the Middle East are literally dying for.
The Middle East is currently experiencing unprecedented democratic movements called the “Arab Spring.”
Massive uprisings have toppled rulers who have sustained dictatorships for decades and oppressed the right to vote. The Arab Spring countries look to the United States as a model to emulate. They seek the same democratic accountability, legitimacy and transparency ingrained within this structure.
But maybe we should be looking toward them. Maybe American youth should admire Arab youth and how much they value democratic rights. At the very least, this is a two-way street.
The Arab Spring demonstrates that young people should operate as active political citizens and make informed decisions during elections.
The general public contributes to the success of the Arab Spring revolutions, and the youth population plays a specifically pivotal role.
Young Americans, on the other hand, appear less politically involved and take their voting rights for granted by being minimally involved in elections.
The youth in the Middle East clamor in the streets as they push for more rights such as the ability to elect their leaders.
Why then, in a democratic nation such as the United States, does youth involvement not match that of the youth in the Middle East?
Countless movements in the United States, such as “Rock the Vote,” have advocated for political participation, stressing that one should not neglect this special privilege. The work of such groups improved youth turnout, but not by substantial margins.
Many praised the 2008 presidential elections for attracting a large youth population (designated as ages 18-29). Still, according to CivicYouth.org, a civic engagement group, only 51 percent of eligible young people voted.
Certain factors, however, deter some from heading to the ballot boxes. Many believe their single vote won’t impact who wins, and subsequently choose not to participate.
Others feel hesitant to invest the time and effort to register or  vote. Some also assume they don’t possess adequate information about the candidates to commit to vote for one or the other.
Some youth actually have legitimate barriers to voting. Several young people might not have citizenship.
A host of countries consistently do not uphold the privilege of the right to vote, but some don’t fully recognize how precious this opportunity is because they never had to fight to secure it.
The youth constitute a significant portion of the voting population. They should not disconnect themselves from politics because elected officials pass legislation that affects them and everyone.
For instance, federal funding will shift based upon who wins. If a Republican wins the presidential election, he or she may implement more budget slashes. This could result in cuts to higher education programs such as those supporting Pell Grants.
Go and vote on Election Day — it’s a right worth dying for.
 
Deborah Oh is a junior majoring in political science. 
The “Arab Spring” is a sham. These movements are merely a repeat of the 1979 Iranian revolution, where an autocratic, oppresive secular regime friendly to the West gets replaced by an autocratic, oppresive, theocratic regime hostile to the west. The people who have taken over Egypt and Libya are hardline Muslim extremists who have already started killing Jews and Christians in their own countries and burning down their churches and synagogues. Now they are openly talking of shredding peace agreements with Israel and invading their territory. 
What has been happening in the Arab world this year is not a cause for celebration. It is a harbinger of war and oppression.
The public opinion appearing from the “Arab Spring” seems to severely condemn Israel for its role in the Middle East .
Is it POSSIBLE that such enduring ire is entirely the product of propaganda campaigns? Or of the spectacular capacity of the Arab heart for irrational hatred, peculiar only to them and, perhaps in the recent past, the Germans?
Or is there a common element that mustn’t be mentioned?
“If a Republican wins the presidential election, he or she may implement more budget slashes.” 
First, we haven’t really had any budget “slashes” – which is why we’re going into the economic dumper.
Second, if you vote based only on what short-term goodies you suck out of taxpayers for yourself, you are a bad person, as more and more “young people” are realizing. I hope lots of them vote what’s best for the country this time, instead of mindlessly following the Democrats like unthinking sheep.

Texas prisons recently abolished the “last meal” tradition for inmates facing execution. This decision was made after death-row inmate Lawrence Russell Brewer requested a large meal and then did not eat any of it, saying he wasn’t hungry.
John Whitmire, state senator of Texas responds by saying of Brewer, “He didn’t give his victim any comfort or choice of last meal.”
Supporters of abolishing the last meal tradition argue it is inappropriate to give those sentenced to death such a privilege. Brad Livingston, executive director of the Texas Department of Criminal justice, said future condemned prisoners will receive as their last meal “the same meal served to other offenders on the unit.”
But the primary concern of ceasing to provide prisoners with a last meal is a moral issue of a different kind. The last meal ritual serves not to comfort the condemned prisoner, but rather to comfort the executioners. Those prepared to execute a person must also be prepared to deny petty comforts.
Still, many prisoners choose to forgo the offer of a special last meal. Troy Davis, recently executed by Georgia after the Supreme Court denied his appeal, had turned down his offer for a last meal, choosing instead to meet with friends, family and supporters.
In the past, many interesting last meal requests have been made, and many have been denied. Below, a few of the more memorable ones.
Robert Madden, executed May 28, 1997
Last meal request: That his final meal be given to a homeless person. (Request denied.)
 
Danny Harris, executed July 30, 1993
Last meal request: ”God’s saving grace, love, truth, peace and freedom.”
 
Carlos Santana, executed March 23, 1993
Last meal request: ”Justice, temperance, with mercy.”

The Obama administration this week announced its plan to relieve states from the difficult plans outlined in the Bush-era “No Child Left Behind” law. Calling it an admirable but flawed system, Obama’s plan to eliminate NCLB will nonetheless keep its basic features in effect.
NCLB is designed to assess the success and quality of school districts based on their performance in high-stakes tests. The most difficult task required 100 percent proficiency of students in math and reading by 2014. This weekend Obama said the government will not require states to meet this standard because success should not be determined solely by how well students perform on standardized tests.
“This does not mean that states will be able to lower their standards or escape accountability,” Obama said. “If states want more flexibility, they’re going to have to set higher standards, more honest standards that prove they’re serious about meeting them.”
This plan of action instead allows states to adopt their own individualized standards in language arts and mathematics, the success of which will be determined over time. Similar to NCLB, the new plan will still measure effectiveness based on test scores, but focuses more on individual development.
Comparable to the original provisions in NCLB, struggling schools could still potentially be closed or turned into charter schools if they do not meet the necessary requirements. However, Obama’s plan reduces the labeling of schools as “failures” and allows educators to focus more on critical thinking and less on teaching to the test.
According to The New York Times, officials in New York, New Jersey, Connecticut and at least eight other states said Friday that they would probably seek the waivers.
We need to move to a new and more 21st century based education reform. 
Consider this as an alternative – No Child Held Back.
