The women’s lacrosse team travels east to Boston this weekend to face off against elite opponents in No. 1 Boston College and Boston University. No. 17 USC is at an all-time record of 12-12 in games on the East Coast.
The Trojans played Boston College last season in a nail-biting match in the team’s home opener at McAlister Field. USC put up a hard fight against the Eagles but was ultimately defeated in overtime, 13-12.
Following their match against the Eagles, the Trojans will play a follow-up match against Boston University. It’s been two years since USC last played the Terriers, a historic first meeting from which the Trojans came away with the win. USC looks to improve its overall record against the Terriers to 2-0 with a win on Sunday.
In last weekend’s games, USC defeated San Diego State 20-16 and Jacksonville University 15-10, improving to 3-0 on the season. In the first half, the Trojans led the San Diego State Aztecs 16-7. USC was able to weather the Aztecs’ comeback and hold on to their victory. 
The game against Jacksonville told a different tale. Going into halftime, the Trojans held just a 1-point lead in the back-and-forth game. The offense exploded in the second half to take over the game. Junior midfielder Kerrigan Miller scored 3 second-half goals to help propel the team to a win. 
Miller said she is not satisfied with the team’s 3-0 start to the season.
“We still have a long journey to go in order to get to where we want to be and reach our full potential,” Miller said.
This weekend brings the Trojans’ first ranked opponent of the season, making it a chance for the team to establish itself among the elite of women’s lacrosse. Miller scored a team-best 5 goals the last time USC played Boston College and will need to put up a similar performance for it to beat the dominant Eagles.
“If we place more focus on our development as a team, striving to play to our full potential, our record will take care of itself,” Miller said. 
Perhaps the biggest challenge for the Trojans will be slowing down Eagles senior attacker and last year’s Tewaaraton Award winner, Sam Apuzzo. Apuzzo scored 3 goals and assisted on the game-winning overtime goal against the Trojans last season.
Miller had nothing but good things to say about Apuzzo, her former teammate on the USA National Team. 
“She is by no means a player any team can underestimate,” Miller said.
This year, Apuzzo is averaging 4.5 goals per game, tied for fourth in the NCAA. 
With wins this weekend, the Trojans could extend their win streak to five and likely leapfrog in the NCAA rankings. Wins would also help down the road in May for tournament seeding. Securing the program’s first win against a No.1-ranked team will also boost team morale and confidence. 
“At the end of the day, the season is long, and the teams that are still playing at the end of May are the ones that are constantly getting better,” Miller said.
First draw is set for noon Friday at the Newton Campus Field.

You can learn everything you need to know about the Los Angeles Football Club within  five minutes of stepping foot in its stadium.
Banc of California Stadium is gleaming, especially when its facade catches the glow of a Los Angeles sunset. Yet it’s the energy within the bowl of the stadium that truly defines this club. Specifically, the north end of the stadium is a sheer wall of standing-room-only pandemonium. By kick-off, this section is filled with 3,252 fans with painted faces and flags that won’t stop waving until long after the final whistle. To watch an LAFC game is to experience a cacophony of black and gold.
It’s only been a year, but LAFC has already earned the right to say that it is the soccer club of Los Angeles. Sure, this team is the new kid on the block, but the tired nobility in Carson has been losing steam for ages, and the glitter of imported European stars will only keep the blood pumping for so much longer. As the Major League Soccer season approaches this weekend, the two teams will start the second leg of their fight for Los Angeles, and LAFC is poised to take the city.
In truth, LAFC and the L.A. Galaxy didn’t finish last season that far apart. The Galaxy ended the season just below the red line, missing the playoffs, but there were only three games of difference between the two teams. Yet week in and week out, it felt as if LAFC had much more to work with, mainly because the club’s fans were so desperately, unyieldingly loud in their support.
That momentum comes from the club’s mentality off the field, built off the motto that it was founded on — street by street, block by block, one by one. The club centered itself in this ideal before construction on its stadium began and, in the process, conquered the most important battle in winning dominance in the city — capturing Latino fans.
The club’s outreach programs truly worked street by street to create a network of fans in the heart of Los Angeles. LAFC recognized everything that the Galaxy did wrong — it didn’t plant itself in a suburb rather than in the city and didn’t appeal to a white “family friendly” ideal rather than to the Latino community that dominates local soccer fandom.
The MLS tried to recapture Latino fans in Los Angeles in the past with Chivas USA, an off-shoot of a Liga MX club, but that venture fell through. This time, however, LAFC made certain these fans weren’t missed. The club’s first signing was Carlos Vela, a Mexican national team star fondly referred to as “Carlito” by many Mexican fans. His acquisition was an incredible tactical move — he led the team in goals and assists last year despite missing a month of the season for the World Cup — and he also helped solidify Mexican fan support for the club.
In the months following Vela’s signing, the club’s emphasis on Latino fans became clear. The official supporters’ group crafted chants in Spanish as well as English, borrowing concepts from Liga MX and the Premier League alike. The team’s events took place at staple sites in downtown L.A., at Randy’s Donuts and Pink’s Hot Dogs and dollar stores alike. The club even released a jersey for Steven Beitashour scripted in Farsi, the Iranian defender’s first language.
The result has been a beautiful fan experience completely molded by a fanbase as colorful and vibrantly unique as Los Angeles itself. Fans wave the Korean, Vietnamese, Uruguayan and Mexican flags alongside the LAFC flags in the stands during games, and chants are sung in a mix of Spanish and English, with other fans quickly picking up the new language. LAFC is a celebration of this city’s rich history, its overlapping cultures and a common thread that brings them together — the game of soccer. 
I’ve covered LAFC since its stadium was just a skeleton, since its roster consisted of three players. I was drenched in beer in the supporters section when Laurent Ciman scored the first-ever goal on the team’s home turf. I’ve seen fans outlast an hours-long rain delay, roaring chants and beating drums even when the thunder drowned them out.
In the past year, I’ve seen enough of this club to know that it has legs. Something is different with LAFC. Its stadium has the hum of a championship team, the buzz of a storied club. The power that it holds among its fans is already greater and deeper than that held by the Galaxy, and if the club keeps winning, that momentum will only build.
It’s hard to say what will happen if LAFC doesn’t keep winning, but one thing is for sure — this team hasn’t been around for long, but it’s certainly here to stay.

With only three games remaining in conference play, the USC men’s basketball team finds itself in the middle of the Pac-12 standings as it looks to complete its first regular season sweep of UCLA since the 2015-16 season.
“We haven’t swept them in awhile, so to go there and get a sweep would be huge for not just us but the school in general because it’s a rivalry game,” junior guard Jonah Mathews said.
In its first matchup, USC defended homecourt and defeated UCLA by 13 points. The Trojans hope to produce a similar result when they step into Pauley Pavilion, where the Bruins are 12-5 on the season.
The Bruins enter the bout with a two-game win streak, having beaten Oregon and Oregon State by a slim margin of a combined 8 points at home. They were successful in those games in large part due to the play of their backcourt, which has carried the Bruins for much of the season. Sophomore guards Jaylen Hands and Kris Wilkes combined for 69 of UCLA’s 158 points in the team’s most recent victories and are the team’s leading scorers at 13.5 and 17.2 points per game, respectively.
USC managed to stop the high-powered backcourt in their first matchup, forcing Hands to commit six turnovers and holding Wilkes to 13 points on 6-of-15 shooting. 
“[Hands and Wilkes] are both good players, so you can only do so much,” Mathews said. “But we’re going to try to make it hard for them.”
The game will feature two of the Pac-12’s leading scorers in Wilkes and USC senior forward Bennie Boatwright. Boatwright scored 21 points in the first matchup and outperformed Wilkes throughout the night. All signs point to Boatwright displaying another dominant scoring output, as he has averaged 22.6 points through the Trojans’ last five games.
However, Boatwright’s success hasn’t carried over throughout the rest of the team.
Nearing the end of an inconsistent season, the Trojans are coming off one of their worst stretches as a team, suffering defeat in four of their last six contests and failing to bring a consistent product to the floor on a nightly basis. Following a dominant 66-49 victory over Oregon in which they stifled the Ducks all night, the Trojans let their last home game of the season slip away in a 67-62 loss to Oregon State. 
Even with the team’s recent lack of production, the Trojans still have their eyes set on their ultimate goal — making the NCAA tournament. USC is currently tied for fifth place with UCLA in the Pac-12 standings and one game out of fourth place, putting them just a strong effort away from securing a crucial first-round bye in the conference tournament.
“To finish in the top-four in the Pac-12 would be huge for us,” Mathews said. “With all the ups and downs we’ve been through, [it] would prove to everyone we’re still a contender and we can do it.”
The Trojans will tip off 6 p.m. against UCLA at Pauley Pavilion.

USC students seeking key health care items for discounted prices can now access these resources at any time at a vending machine on the first floor of King Hall. The vending machine carries contraception, condoms and even cough drops, cold and headache medication, all at reduced prices. Necessary and intuitive as a resource like this may be on a college campus, it was a long time in the making at USC, following strides made first by schools like UC Davis, Columbia University and others. 
Though the University has installed a Plan B vending machine after years of student activism and demands, the fight for student access to crucial reproductive health care can’t end here. As universities like USC across the country make important, laudable progress on protecting and expanding students’ reproductive rights, there is still much work to be done in one particular area: abortion access. 
Public universities in California — which, of course, don’t include USC — came close to carrying medication abortions paid for by private funding in their health centers, when a bill called S.B. 320 passed out of the State Assembly and Senate by a 2-1 margin. But the bill, which 60 percent of surveyed California voters supported, was vetoed by former Gov. Jerry Brown last September. 
According to Brown, S.B. 320 was “unnecessary” because — in Brown’s mind — abortion is already highly accessible. Brown is a white man who hasn’t experienced unwanted pregnancy in college. In addition, 43 percent of California counties lack abortion providers. At the time the bill was introduced, the average distance to an abortion provider was five miles from California State University campuses and seven miles from University of California campuses. Access to these clinics could come with substantial cost because most students in the CSU and UC systems would have to pay for transportation, and face varying financial barriers as college students. The bill itself first arose from student need and been proposed by University of California students who had either struggled to access abortion care firsthand or knew peers who had.
S.B. 320 was proposed to address a crucial gap in female college students’ health care needs, and account for the fact that seeking abortion care off campus often required students to miss class and responsibilities or shoulder steep financial burden. In more rural parts of California, travel to access abortion can easily be an all-day affair and involve inaccessible travel and lodging costs. 
Let’s be clear: With or without a bill like S.B. 320, California’s public university students are already seeking abortions via medication, which is highly safe and critical to empowering students to stay in school, graduate and have control over their lives. Every month, an estimated 519 UC and CSU students seek abortions via medication off campus, according to a UC San Francisco study.
That’s why S.B. 24, a new bill in the State Senate that carries on the mission of S.B. 320, is so important. Gov. Gavin Newsom expressed his support for S.B. 24, and with an even more solid pro-choice majority in the state legislature as of the 2018 election, there is reason to be optimistic.
Because USC is a private institution, S.B. 24 wouldn’t directly impact USC students. But that doesn’t mean we as young people don’t have a stake in it nor that we shouldn’t be involved in the fight to pass it. Not only should we lobby our state representatives to support the bill and encourage our peers to do the same, but we should also call upon our own University to follow the lead of its fellow California universities and offer the student body the critical health resource that many college students in this state may soon have access to.
The recent addition of an affordable contraception vending machine to USC’s campus marks a critical step in the right direction for promoting gender equity, safety and access to key health care for the student body. But however uncomfortable this reality may be for some, the fact remains that abortion is health care, and like emergency contraception and all other safe, legal health care, it must always be an accessible option for college students across all socioeconomic classes.

 Six former USC students came forward two weeks ago with accusations of sexual battery and harassment against Dennis Kelly, a men’s health doctor who practiced at the Engemann Student Health Center until August 2018. In light of these accusations, it’s clear that there is a long way to go in mending the relationship between USC students and Engemann’s practitioners. Since a Los Angeles Times report detailing sexual misconduct allegations against former campus gynecologist George Tyndall was published last May, the University has focused its efforts on improving Engemann services. However, it has neglected to mend the relationship between students and Engemann’s health care providers. While the administration plays an important role in overseeing ethical practice, the individual doctors who interact directly with students must also establish trust. The University must give students a voice in choosing the people who provide them treatment.
Doctors hired by USC should not only be qualified by the University’s standards, but also approved by students. Plaintiffs in the lawsuit against Kelly reported that Kelly’s remarks and behavior became demeaning once he learned that the patients identified as gay or bisexual. Similarly, reports of Tyndall’s misconduct included multiple accounts of Tyndall’s alleged behavior being “creepy,” along with accounts of students feeling humiliated during their appointments and emotionally traumatized long after, according to the Los Angeles Times. 
In the Tyndall case, University officials failed to take action even after learning about his alleged conduct through numerous reports filed by former patients.
Simply put, the University is not the best judge of what qualifies as a high standard of care for its students. It is time for students to have a central role in deciding which health care professionals they are comfortable receiving care from.
This means involving students in the screening process, a practice that has already been implemented successfully with employees at other universities. For example, at the University of Washington’s School of Computer Science and Engineering, students play a key role in hiring professors. Candidates for faculty positions give sample lectures, which student teaching assistants attend to determine whether or not they are a good fit for the student body and the school. At the end of the lectures, students provide written evaluations for administrators to consider in their hiring decisions. By giving the student body a voice in which professors become part of students’ academic journeys, the school has built a faculty team that students respect and trust.
Given the sensitive nature of sexual health, it makes sense to implement a similar student-centered approach to the hiring process at Engemann. Both Tyndall and Kelly were qualified doctors, but the discomfort and humiliation that students experienced under their treatment went unnoticed during the standardized screening process administered by school officials. 
The opportunity to interact with doctors before they are officially hired would allow students to evaluate whether or not those doctors are people they can trust and comfortably seek out for sexual health concerns, especially for students who are placed in vulnerable positions because they are unaware of standard practices. Students should be able to interact with doctors, gauge professionalism, conduct and style of practice. If students are able to interact with doctors before they are hired, the rest of the student body would be more likely to trust doctors at the student health center.
According to The Pharmaceutical Journal, the key pillars of building and maintaining trust between health care providers and patients are communication, honesty, competence and respect. In taking advantage of their patients, Tyndall and Kelly severely violated each of these principles. Their actions have tarnished not only their own careers, but also the credibility of the entire Engemann Student Health Center.
As Student Health Services administrators work to repair the relationship between doctors and patients, they have taken steps to involve students by holding a conversation series in which students have the opportunity to voice their concerns and advice. Hosting these talks after physicians have already been hired and simply talking about the breaches of trust is not enough. To truly place student interests at the forefront of health care, the University must begin actively including students in every step of reshaping the standard of care at the health center, beginning with the hiring process.

Entrepreneur and media mogul Maverick Carter will deliver the keynote address at the 2019 Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism commencement ceremony on May 10, according to an Annenberg news release. 
Carter co-founded media production company SpringHill Entertainment with longtime business partner LeBron James. Under Carter, the CEO of SpringHill Entertainment, the company has produced shows like NBC’s “The Wall” and YouTube Red’s “Best Shot.” It has also produced docu-series like HBO’s “Student Athlete” and STARZ’s “Warriors of Liberty City.” 
The news release said Carter’s digital media company projects have reached cross-cultural and diverse audiences because his stories impact not just athletes but musicians, actors and professionals of all fields. His platform led him to create a cultural movement titled “I am more than an athlete.”
Carter also co-founded UNINTERRUPTED, a multimedia content website. According to its website, UNINTERRUPTED is an all-digital sports network that launched in 2014. Carter has also collaborated with companies like Facebook and Warner Bros. Entertainment to globally distribute his content.
Carter’s upcoming projects include “What’s My Name,” a documentary about Muhammad Ali on HBO, and a series starring Octavia Spencer who will play entrepreneur Madam C.J. Walker. 
“I am looking forward to hearing his commencement address to USC Annenberg grads,” wrote Annenberg Dean Willow Bay in a statement to the Daily Trojan. “He’s an innovator, thinking about ways to enable all people — not just world-famous athletes —  to own their stories and elevate their voices.”  
Past Annenberg commencement speakers include philanthropist and media leader Oprah Winfrey, former First Lady of California and journalist Maria Shriver and television writer and producer Norman Lear.
In a statement to USC News, Bay said that she hopes Carter’s storytelling ability will inspire Annenberg graduates to venture on creative journeys and pursue their own respective careers.
Annenberg will honor nearly 900 students with bachelors, masters and doctoral degrees in the fields of communication, journalism, public relations and public diplomacy during commencement, following USC’s general commencement ceremony.

The Center for the Political Future hosted a discussion on Democrats who have announced their candidacy for the 2020 presidential election. 
The panel, which was moderated by Center co-director Robert Shrum,  included political consultant Stephanie Cutter, who served as deputy campaign manager for former President Barack Obama’s 2012 re-election campaign, Jane Junn, a political science and gender studies professor, and Adam Nagourney, Los Angeles Bureau Chief for The New York Times. 
Nagourney said he is interested in seeing what type of candidate Democrats will vote for and how this could affect their chances of winning the election.
“The key question in this election is whether Democratic primary voters end up going [for] somebody who they think has the best chance of beating Donald Trump … or whether they’re going to go with their hearts and go for the person that … expresses how they feel,” Nagourney said.
The panelists also discussed how the Democratic National Convention may change its debate format in 2020 to accommodate the number of candidates by randomly splitting them up over multiple days as opposed to one.
“[Debates] are one tool through an electoral process through which voters get a lens of what these people are made of,” Cutler said. 
Cutter said the number of Democratic candidates going into the 2020 election could be similar to the amount of candidates in the 2016 primary for Republicans. In order to win, Cutter said Democrats will have to gain voters’ attention. 
“Trump completely mastered how to get attention in a very crowded field,” Cutter said. “The Republican primary at this point four years ago was just about as big [as the Democratic 2020 field].” 
Panelists also mentioned how Trump’s re-election campaign will compel more liberal Democratic candidates to pull their platforms toward the political center, in an effort to appeal to moderate voters. 
Nagourney said recent actions by prominent Democrats like Sen. Kamala Harris’ discussions on abolishing private insurance companies and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez’s controversial Green New Deal could hurt Democrats’ chances of winning the presidency. 
“Some [Democrats], and I would include Senator Harris in this, don’t have that much experience in running for president,” Nagourney said. “You make mistakes, and somebody like Trump, or anyone with some experience in this knows how to seize on mistakes.”  
Panelists also commented on the role of identity politics in the election. Junn said the standard of white male leaders cannot be avoided on either side of the election.
“Whiteness and maleness has always been the standard by which we have come to see who is a legitimate political candidate, who is a leader, who is the person who should be the chief executive,” Junn said. 
During the question and answer portion of the event, Savanna Mesch, a senior majoring in communication, inquired about how young people can stay engaged in the election without becoming apathetic. 
Shrum said he believes young people are more likely to be involved in the 2020 election than in past elections.
“I think you’re going to see young people getting very involved in this campaign,” Shrum said. “I think their turnout is going to be pretty high in 2020; I think it’s going to be pretty high in the primaries.” 
Mesch said she attended the panel to learn more about the role of young voters in the 2020 election. 
“I’m also really interested in conversations about 2020,” she said. “I think the field is really crowded and with Bernie being so popular last time, I’m really interested to see how young people are going to digest this election as compared to last time.”

USC will join the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine’s Action Collaborative on Preventing Sexual Harassment in Higher Education as a founding member, University officials announced Tuesday in a letter to the USC community. 
The collaborative aims to prevent sexual assault and harassment by implementing systemic changes and policies at its member universities.  
“As a founding member of this NASEM collaborative, the University will play a substantial role in developing the scope and vision of this important project and is making a pledge of significant financial support for the next four years,” Executive Vice Provost Elizabeth Graddy wrote.
As one of 28 founding members of the initiative, USC hopes to accomplish four main objectives through its involvement in the consortium. According to the memo the collaborative seeks to raise awareness of sexual misconduct and discuss recommendations to approach it. The consortium also plans to share institutional strategies to reduce harassment, gather research results across institutions and develop a standard for measuring progress toward reducing and preventing harassment.
“This investment reflects the Provost’s deep commitment to address openly the issue of sexual harassment here at USC and to work together with our peer institutions to help prevent sexual harassment throughout higher education,” Graddy wrote. “These efforts are vital to upholding our core values and fulfilling our responsibility to our students, faculty and staff.” 
Nine professors from the Keck School of Medicine, the Viterbi School of Engineering, the Dworak-Peck School of Social Work, the Rossier School of Education and the Dornsife College of Letters, Arts and Sciences will serve as representatives on the NASEM collaborative alongside Graddy . 
Associate professor of emergency medicine Parveen Parmar,  one of the representatives in the collaborative, said she and other faculty attended a national meeting in Washington D.C. in November to discuss how leaders at various academic institutions have developed models to address sexual abuse on their campuses. 
“What was born of that event was movement toward this collaborative on addressing sexual harassment in science, engineering and medicine,” Parmar said.
Parmar said it is necessary to find new ways to address sexual harassment at USC to create a safe campus for all community members. Through the consortium, she said that USC will be able to learn about and implement models that have worked for other universities. 
“Like any other threat to public health on campus, sexual harassment is a threat to the health of our campus, and I think it needs to be addressed using those best practices that we can glean from a multi-institution collaborative like this,” Parmar said. 
Cynthia Herrington, another representative in the collaborative, said that in two weeks, representatives will meet to discuss their agenda for the four-year initiative. In the future, she said the collaborative plans to hold two national meetings each year, one for representatives and another for any interested institutions.
In light of sexual harassment allegations against two former campus doctors, Herrington said it is necessary for USC representatives to work with other schools to find potential solutions and discover new metrics to accurately measure sexual harassment incidents. 
“Because of the challenges that USC has faced, there’s a lot of brainstorming occuring presently, and for us to be able to work with other members of academia to find best practices, I just think it’s an imperative,” Herrington said.

Amid controversy surrounding another sexual harassment case at the Engemann Student Health Center, a current USC policy is alarming some students and staff. A policy from the University Faculty Handbook states that voluntary and consensual relationships between faculty and students are strongly discouraged ­but not strictly prohibited.
The policy acknowledges there is “an inherent power differential between faculty and students” and restricts relationships between a professor and a student who is actively in his or her class. However, according to the policy, a student can be romantically or sexually involved with a professor so long as their relationship falls within certain guidelines.
Academic Senate President Yaniv Bar-Cohen acknowledged that some believe it is difficult, if at all possible, for faculty-student relationships to be consensual.
“I know many argue that it’s not even possible to have a consensual relationship like this,” Bar-Cohen said. “If there’s a supervisory relationship, [students] have a lot of reasons to fear not being very friendly. Therefore the faculty member might view something as consensual or as a mutual interest when it might actually not be there, and I don’t think that we should even allow that possibility.” 
The policy has raised questions among the USC community as to whether or not students can truly consent to a relationship with a teacher. 
“A student would probably feel [pressured],” said Abraham Santana, a freshman majoring in mechanical engineering. “They might feel stuck in that relationship.” 
The Faculty Handbook recommends the faculty member in question inform their administrators of their relationships. The Office of the Vice Provost declined to comment on whether any relationships have ever been reported to their office or what its protocol is when relationships or conflicts within relationships are reported.
Several universities have already employed policies that explicitly prohibit faculty-student relationships in the last five years, including Stanford University, MIT and Columbia University. The University of Michigan changed its policy last week due to university involvement in litigation. 
Amad Ross, a freshman at Columbia University, commented on the impact of the ban on all faculty-student relationships at his school.
“There’s such a large power [difference] in most cases,” Ross said. “I think the risk is so high that even in cases where that relationship would be OK, it’s better to prohibit that relationship just because of the small number of cases in which a relationship would be detrimental to the student’s future.”  
Bar-Cohen said that relationships between faculty and students present high risk. 
“I’m not pretending [banning relationships] isn’t a sacrifice,” Bar-Cohen said. “Any time you take away someone’s right to do anything it’s a sacrifice. I just think for me, the risks versus benefits on this one is pretty easy. It’s a sacrifice worth making.” 
USC has assembled a task force to prevent sexual harassment on campus. One of the goals of the Joint Provost/Academic Senate Task Force is to limit sexual coercion.
Although relationships between students and faculty are currently permitted, a spokesperson for the Office of the Vice Provost told the Daily Trojan that they are still heavily discouraged.
“The Academic Senate has also endorsed the position strongly discouraging sexual relationships and sexual advances between faculty and any students at all, even those not in the faculty member’s class,” the spokesperson said. 
Some fear the lack of an explicit ban on sexual relationships between faculty and students counters the initiative created by the task force to reduce sexual coercion on campus.
“I think it’s pretty ridiculous that [this policy is] allowed,” said Lilit Yengoian, a freshman majoring in neuroscience. “I feel like it’s a threat to both academics and sexual harassment.”

The Undergraduate Student Government Senate voted Tuesday to provide additional funding to the Black Student Assembly after members of the cultural group voiced concerns regarding spring funding at a Senate meeting.
Each assembly and committee within USG receives a budget for the academic year at the beginning of fall semester. In the spring, the USG Budget Allocation Committee typically also provides additional funding due to the influx of spring admits. Currently, the committee is led by President Debbie Lee, Vice President Blake Ackerman, Senior Director of Programming Keisuke Fujiwara, Speaker Pro Tempore Matthew Crane and Treasurer Hunter Quartieri.
According to a USG Spring Over Enrollment Allocation document, USG proposed that approximately $617,500 be allocated to assemblies and committees last fall. BSA’s total budget for the academic year was $74,000. Additional funding increased BSA’s budget by $2,500 for the spring. But according to BSA co-director Mae Gates, BSA initially requested $9,500 in additional funding for the spring.
“What BSA is currently allocated is not equitable and needs to change,” Gates said. “Black students deserve the rights for equitable programming.”
This $2,500 increase in funding is the lowest of any organization included in the USG programming allocations. 
For example, the Asian Pacific American Student Assembly and the Queer & Ally Student Assembly received $12,000 and $3,000 in additional funding, respectively.
According to BSA, the organization projected they would need a total of $8,963 for spring events and programming. 
“We’re very, very spring heavy,” BSA co-director Nia Warren said. “We’re really relying on this extra money. This isn’t us trying to use it for thrills.” 
BSA has a series of large events planned for the spring, including the Mahogany Ball, Black Grad and Gearfest.
During the open discussion, Gates said BSA may have to cancel events this semester if the budget is not readjusted. 
“We do have a lot of money at USC … looking at how much need there [is], we don’t have enough to fund every single group,” Fujiwara said. “I want everyone to understand that a compromise was inevitable … I know the struggle of being [in] a marginalized community.”
USG allocates funds from its budget to cultural assemblies based on the assemblies’ fall spending records. According to Lee, the budget committee refers to invoices from cultural assemblies for future events and costs and considers consistency in previous financial documentation provided by cultural assemblies when deciding how to allocate funds.
“Something that was a heavy factor in our budget consideration was looking at how the groups demonstrated that they were able to meet their Fall 2018 threshold,” Lee said. “We recognize that there were some groups that really didn’t quite meet that threshold of what they projected to spend.”
Gates initially expressed concern over bias within the budget allocation committee. 
“I think right now we have an opportunity to amend what needs to be amended,” Gates said. “Hopefully make sure that USG shows … that black students deserve the equitable right to have that equitable programming.”
After holding a two-hour open forum with meeting attendees, senators held four separate votes to decide whether or not to increase BSA’s funding. 
By the end of the meeting, they agreed to grant BSA $4,000 from USG’s Professional and Academic Fund and $2,000 from the Discretionary Fund, in addition to the initial $2,500 allocated for the semester.  
At the conclusion of the meeting, BSA’s spring funding increased an additional $6,000 to a total of $8,500.
“As BSA co-director, this is a compromise that we are comfortable making,” Gates said. “I appreciate the time, I appreciate the thoughts, I appreciate all my assembly members and everyone gathered … for this.”

Some of the greatest basketball players never played a single NCAA game. Icons like Kobe Bryant and LeBron James went straight into the NBA from high school without ever having to risk injuries. The bottom line? It’s time to end the one-and-done rule.
According to StubHub, the average ticket price for last week’s Duke-North Carolina basketball game was well over $4,000. There was so much hype surrounding the game and Duke freshman Zion Williamson that even former President Barack Obama sat in the front row. 
Yes, it’s typically a big rivalry game, but that’s not the only reason why people were willing to purchase such expensive tickets —  getting to see Williamson play North Carolina was ultimately the primary motivation for many of those who walked through the doors of Cameron Indoor Stadium.
Zion Williamson has arguably become the biggest college basketball star in recent years due to his sheer athleticism and the virality of his recorded dunks. Unfortunately, he didn’t earn even a penny that night. 
Instead, the only thing Williamson got was an injury in the first minute of the game because his shoe broke.
Prior to the game, it was almost certain that Williamson would make millions of dollars as the first pick in the NBA draft, and also sign one of the largest shoe deals ever for a player coming out of college.
While his injury that night doesn’t look too serious, imagine if Williamson had torn his ACL. Everything he’s worked for and earned could have been taken away from him in an instant — the guy that people were willing to spend over $4,000 to watch would have made absolutely nothing from it. 
It isn’t fair for athletes to risk their potential value each night they take the floor to earn nothing while their respective universities are profiting off their talent. What’s even more illogical is that they aren’t allowed to sign endorsement deals while playing in college.
Collegiate athletes like Williamson should not be restricted from marketing themselves to their highest potential. Every shoe company would offer Williamson millions of dollars right now if they were allowed to, but instead, Williamson is left with nothing because of collegiate restrictions?
If Duke makes the Final Four in this year’s March Madness, and Williamson is healthy and playing, I’m confident the tournament will have its highest television ratings of the decade because people want to see what he will do next. 
From an NBA perspective, it would have been catastrophic if Williamson had suffered a career-ending injury in that game. With LeBron James getting older, the NBA is desperate to find a player that could become the face of the league. Many believe that Williamson has what it takes.
The NBA is a star-driven league — the general public typically watches basketball because it wants to see specific players play, not to watch good teams play. Ratings were so high for the league in the ’90s because Michael Jordan played. 
NBA ratings are likely to decline once James leaves unless a player with as much star power emerges into the league. If Williamson continues on his current path, he has the potential to become James’ heir. However, had this once-in-a-generation talent suffered a career-ending injury in that college game, the NBA could have lost millions of dollars in potential marketing value.
While collegiate basketball offers players the opportunity to market themselves and maximize their potential value on the national stage, it is not worth risking the opportunity to make millions of dollars. Williamson’s injury scare demonstrates that elite college athletes and the NBA have too much at stake to continue the one-and-done rule.

Sept. 12, 1970, was the first game of the season for USC and Alabama. At the time, the matchup was seen as a clash of two of the nation’s best collegiate football programs, and USC ended up routing Alabama 42-21. In hindsight, the game between Paul “Bear” Bryant’s all-white Crimson Tide and John McKay’s fully integrated Trojans, featuring its all-black backfield, served as a catalyst for the rapid integration of Southeastern Conference football programs.
“You don’t realize at the time [that] it’s happening,” said Sam Cunningham, USC’s fullback from 1970 to 1972. “You realize a day later or a year later, and that’s what happened to me. I realized what we were involved in and how it was a special game.”
Alabama’s racial climate 
Two years after the conclusion of the 14-year-long Civil Rights Movement, segregation was outlawed by the federal government, but in the Deep South, both political figures and a majority of the white population were still resistant to change.
“In some ways, slavery never ended,” said John Giggie, an African American history professor at the University of Alabama. “It just simply was transformed into a program of white supremacy.”
The University of Alabama resisted integration until 1963, when Vivian Malone became one of two black students admitted that year. George Wallace, Alabama’s governor, attempted to block Malone’s entrance to the university.
“The reason [the University of] Alabama had resisted integrating itself was because this integration was seen as a bellwether for integration,” Gigge said. “If University of Alabama was to remain all white, that would be a sign, a symbol, of the state’s efforts to maintain segregation as normal, as customary, as effectively the law of the land.”
No matter who was elected during this era, the governor became a figurehead for a population that was resistant to change. Wallace had lost his first governor race to John Patterson due to Patterson’s segregation centric platform.
“When [Wallace] lost to Patterson, he swore that he would never lose a race again over black questions,” Giggie said. “So he came out very aggressively in the next election that he won on his ‘segregation now, forever’ campaign.”
In an environment so heavily influenced by beliefs on segregation, the USC-Alabama game became a critical meeting for the fate of collegiate football.
The face of the Tide
Donning a suit and tie with a houndstooth emblazoned fedora to accompany his 6-foot-3 stature, Paul “Bear” Bryant was, unmistakably, the face of Alabama football.
Governing with an iron fist, Bryant expected nothing less than perfection from his athletes. Throughout his 25-year tenure at the helm of the Crimson Tide, Bryant amassed six national championships, 14 conference championships and 323 career wins.
But Bryant’s legend status wasn’t restricted to his university. To this day, Alabama has never had a professional sports team. Alabama football is the state’s professional sport. This setting allowed Tide coaches to become household names. 
“He is a legend and probably was a legend even by that time,” said Ken Gaddy, the director of the Paul W. Bryant Museum in Tuscaloosa, Alabama. “He was bigger than life, even at that time.”
Bryant also co-hosted the Bear Bryant Show, an hour-long weekly talk show. Although the show primarily analyzed Alabama football, Bryant also spoke about God, family and the country, furthering himself as an icon among both football fans and members of the Alabama community. Bryant’s show ran in the same time slot as NFL football yet consistently had better ratings than the live professional football games. 
The face of the Trojans
On the other side of the field, USC head coach John McKay, entering his 11th season at the helm of the Trojans, had an equally impressive resume. McKay hardly ever fell below a .700 win percentage on his way to a 127-40-8 career record. 
At this time, both the Trojans and Crimson Tide were widely respected as football powerhouses, but the teams could not be more different, as McKay’s Trojans sported a fully integrated squad. 
As a matter of fact, USC had its first black player in 1925 — guard Brice Taylor. McKay’s 1970 team was not only fully integrated, but it also featured USC’s all-black backfield, consisting of Cunningham at fullback, Jimmy Jones at quarterback and Clarence Davis at running back.  
“[My dad’s] view, in general, was that he truly didn’t care what color you were,” said J.K. McKay, John McKay’s son. “It didn’t matter. They were football players.”
In 1970 and 1971, USC had its worst two seasons in nearly a decade, finishing 6-4 in both. Heading into the 1970 season, USC was highly regarded, coming off a 10-0-1 season and Rose Bowl win. Alabama was sporting its worst season in the Bryant era. Regardless, both teams were seen as football powerhouses.
The addition of an 11th regular season game in 1970 created a spare game on the schedule. The historic USC-Alabama game was born out of friendship. 
“Bear Bryant and my dad were the closest of friends,” J.K. said. “Bear and his wife stayed at our house all the time in the offseason. They’d be at our house a lot.”
Though the game started as a friendly showdown between two of the greatest collegiate football coaches of all time, it would later become an unexpectedly significant match. 
Entering foreign territory
The 1970 USC football team made its way to Alabama, and although the team was apprehensive about entering the unknown of the deep South, its focus was on winning a football game.
“You see images on television, and the civil rights issues at that time were pretty intense. I understood that but never really thought about it,” Cunningham said. “My focus was to play a football game against a very good college football program.”
While lynchings, bombings and burnings were still prevalent in 1970, some players felt a sense of security solely because they were USC, and they were here to play football.
“You had those thoughts that [racially motivated violence] happens down here,” Jones said. “But we also had that feeling that we were absolved from that because we were USC, and this was more just football than it was the race thing.”
While the team was traveling through Alabama, it was greeted by racial slurs and gawking stares from white members of the Alabama community, Jones said. Though it was met with criticism from the majority of Alabamians, USC’s fully-integrated football team offered a glimmer of hope for black Americans. 
Jones said that as the USC team bus navigated the streets in the predominantly black neighborhoods of Birmingham, people went out onto their lawns and porches to cheer and give well wishes to what was more than just a football team.
“They saw us as a group of people that could maybe help make their lives better down there,” Jones said. 
When USC ran out of the tunnel that September night, however, the Trojans were greeted by a stark white crowd, as black Americans were still not allowed to enter Legion Field. The black community didn’t let that stop them from watching the game that would ultimately lead to the SEC’s integration.
“They were on rooftops and the hills where they could look into the stadium,” Jones said.
The game’s spectators witnessed a blowout. The Trojans were bigger, stronger and faster. Cunningham posted 135 yards on 12 carries, topped off with two touchdowns en route to a 42-21 USC win.
“[Alabama] hadn’t seen anyone like [Cunningham]: 6-foot-3, 210 to 215 pounds, [good] speed,” Jones said. “They were outmatched for someone like Cunningham coming through the holes that were wide [open].”
Jones dismantled the Alabama defense on bootleg keepers while aiding USC in a 559-offensive-yard effort, which  he heavily attributed to the strong talent among the Trojans.
“We just had so many horses,” Jones said in a postgame interview with the Los Angeles Times. “These guys are all so good that it really doesn’t matter who we have out there.”
Jones believes that a crushing victory aided in alleviating some of the racially-driven preconceived notions many fans had.
“[Winning] takes away a lot of the opinions people had about you going into the game, whether it is a race issue or a [talent issue],” Jones said.
Making the switch
Although he is mostly remembered for the awards he brought back to Tuscaloosa and his staggeringly great career record of 323–85–17, Bryant became the first head coach in the SEC to integrate a collegiate football team. 
In a Los Angeles Times article by Jeff Prugh titled “USC-Alabama Proved More Than a Football Game” published two days afterwards, Prugh wrote about his experience witnessing the shift that had already begun among the Crimson loyals.
“‘You know,’ said a man in a plaid shirt. ‘I sure bet the Bear wished he had two or three of them n—- boys on his team NOW. They were huge,’” the article read.
The following year, Bryant made the switch, as running back Wilbur Jackson, born and raised in Ozark, Ala., became the first black football player to play on a football scholarship at the University of Alabama. 
USC and Alabama met again to open the 1971 season. The game was much different this time, however. Not only was the game played at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum, but the Trojans were bested in a 17-10 game by a now albeit barely integrated Crimson Tide.
Though Jackson was a single, small speck in the massive dynasty that was Alabama football, Bryant’s decision was, for the most part, well-received by the Alabama community.
“If Coach Bryant was for it, then everybody else was pretty much for it too,” Gaddy said. “That made it easier for other people to accept and move forward.”
In the ensuing years, Alabama football continued to integrate and by the 1980 season, the Crimson Tide’s roster featured as many African American players as any other elite collegiate football team. For the remainder of the Bryant era, Alabama failed to fall below a .667 winning percentage.
In hindsight 
Players, coaches, football fans and analysts have had nearly 50 years to reflect on the historic game that took place that September night in Birmingham. At the time, it was football:  The University of Southern California versus the University of Alabama. 
Looking back at it, the game stood for much more — integration versus segregation.
Those close to the situation have a tendency to overstate the impact of USC and Cunningham’s effect on integration in the South.
It is impossible to deny that the game of football, a language Alabamians understood, served as a vehicle to aid in the Civil Rights’ efforts of great men like Martin Luther King Jr. and Malcolm X to prove that skin color should never dictate our beliefs of an individual or race. 
Football is a game, but for one September night in Birmingham, it was so much more.

“Women are machines for suffering. For me, there are only two kinds of women: goddesses and doormats.” 
While this quote reads like the harsh words of a serial misogynist, it was said by a man worth $500 million at the time of his death and who enjoys a status of nearly unparalleled veneration in our culture. Pablo Picasso — an artist whose influence was undoubtedly profound and far-reaching — was among a striking number of great creatives who were also destructive egoists. 
His own granddaughter, Marina Picasso, documented his appalling sexual misconduct and tendencies to objectify women in her memoir: “He submitted them to his animal sexuality, tamed them, bewitched them, ingested them and crushed them onto his canvas. After he had spent many nights extracting their essence, once they were bled dry, he would dispose of them.” 
Yikes. 
His body of work demonstrated a history of mythologizing himself as a Minotaur raping  women while they were asleep; his tumultuous personal relationships drove several of his lovers to suicide; he was an adulterer and abuser. Yet, he is still saluted by institutions and critics as a master of some of the most important artistic movements of the 20th century, and his name is synonymous with the standard for high art. 
In the #MeToo era, such egregious displays of toxic masculinity are condemned in every industry and at every level. At long last, male figures of power and distinction are being outed for their predation, and the ubiquity of their misbehavior is not only being laid bare but being taken to court. The likes of  producer Harvey Weinstein and director Roman Polanski are all but blacklisted, actor Kevin Spacey will never be cast again and singer R. Kelly will never sell another record. 
But in 2019 alone, Picasso is slated to be featured in monumental retrospectives on nearly every continent. Carl Andre, dubbed the art world’s O.J. Simpson for allegedly murdering his wife and fellow artist Ana Mendieta, has also enjoyed solo exhibitions at countless major museums. So how did the art world slip through the cracks in holding its prominent men accountable? 
One possible explanation is that nobody cares about a well-behaved artist, so immorality works to one’s advantage in the art world. Dereliction plays a commanding role in culture, and a chaotic mind is key to selling the artist as great. We are drawn to wildmen, to outlaws and rebels and scandal-makers, to assholes who are screwed up enough to enact fantasies we are too timid to probe ourselves — we relish them with a touch of admiration and a shiver of unease. 
What’s more, in art, the personality of the maker is inextricably intertwined with the work itself. The art world is littered with anti-Semites, womanizers and pedophiles, but one interpretation claims stifling these traits would fundamentally alter artists’ abilities to create the works they are acclaimed for.
This is a weak excuse for refusing to re-evaluate how we judge greatness. That the quality and profitability of the art market would be harmed is not enough to justify ignoring the malpractice of the art world’s key figures. In continuing to elevate works by people like Andre and Picasso, we are conveniently choosing to separate the artist from the art. But if #MeToo has taught us anything, it’s that inclusion means embracing more complex historical narratives and taking steps to right past wrongs. 
The question is not whether we can separate the art from the artist but whether we should. I believe unequivocally that we should. No one looks at a Picasso in a museum and immediately dismisses it because he was a deplorable human being. On the contrary, his art’s very placement in a museum setting legitimizes it as an invaluable part of art history. And as long as museums fail to acknowledge who he really was, he will never be seen as anything other than a genius. It’s therefore up to curators, critics and institutions to lead the charge in introducing evolved narratives and to demonstrate the fluidity of the art world. Picasso’s legacy can never be erased, but it can be rewritten to relate his misogyny to his work and to give visibility to the women who were his muses. 
Maybe one day the art world will stop romanticizing artists in spite of their terrible behavior. A girl can only dream.

Though we’re still over a year away from the 2020 presidential election, it seems like every prominent Democrat is already throwing their hat into the ring to become the party’s presidential nominee. And with the election taking over news media, keeping up and making sense of politics can be difficult, especially when broadcast news tends to ignore policy platforms and candidates’ qualifications to lead the country in favor of covering populism and sensationalism. 
Instead of tuning into CNN or Fox News to keep up with the political news cycle, check out these insightful podcasts providing deeper political analysis into the upcoming elections.
Keep it!
From the Crooked Media family that brought “Pod Save America” and “Lovett or Leave It,” “Keep It!” is at the intersection between politics and pop culture — one that appears to be increasingly prevalent each day. After all, more movies and television shows today are laden with political messages, and celebrities like Oprah Winfrey have as much 2020 presidential buzz as the high-profile senators who have declared their candidacies. 
With Ira Madison, Louis Virtel and Kara Brown as hosts with strong viewpoints, a thorough understanding of both politics and entertainment and just the right amount of humor for a politics podcast, “Keep It” guides listeners through understanding the ins and outs of this intersection well. 
Each week, Madison, Virtel and Brown discuss their perspectives on political news from the entertainment world (or entertainment news from the political world) and bring on a guest, usually an artist or director. Recently, they’ve featured Dan Levy, an actor from the popular television show “Schitt’s Creek,” and Barry Jenkins, who directed “Moonlight” and “If Beale Street Could Talk.” 
They also end every episode with the “Keep It!” segment, where each host chooses one person from pop culture news and proceeds to roast that person for whatever objectionable action they committed.
FiveThirtyEight Politics
FiveThirtyEight editor-in-chief Nate Silver is widely known for applying his knowledge of data journalism to his coverage of politics and sports and the FiveThirtyEight Politics podcast is much the same journalism with a merging of perspectives from political analysts. Producer Galen Druke, hosts the show, and is typically joined by senior political writer Clare Malone, managing editor Micah Cohen and Silver. 
Unlike most politically centered shows, where often only one perspective is represented as “right,” FiveThirtyEight encourages respectful debate. Despite having a variety of perspectives on most political issues, the group is made up of genuine friends — they disagree often, but no one ever has to be right. By presenting their various perspectives, the group informs listeners on sensible viewpoints and allows them to make their own stances about these issues. 
Aside from its weekly discussion show, the podcast is also home to more narrative-driven short series about political data journalism. For example, “The Gerrymandering Project” is a multimedia series exploring the process of redistricting and how it affects election outcomes. It has brought in-depth reporting on the history of and current litigation around the practice of gerrymandering. Paired with data models and interactive online graphics, “The Gerrymandering Project” paints a full picture of  what redistricting  looks like. 
It’s been a minute
NPR’s Sam Sanders has a lot of character, and he brings all of it to his podcast “It’s Been A Minute.” It’s not strictly a politics podcast — it generally discusses news, and its twice-a-week frequency allows it to have one news discussion episode a week and one longform interview with a cultural figure. 
But the dominance of politics in the news, whether it’s during the election cycle or not, makes it a frequent topic on Sanders’ show. Each week, he brings on two other journalists (whether they’re his NPR peers or other L.A.-based reporters) to discuss the news. 
The show is filled with fun segments, like the lead segment that asks each guest to sum up the week’s news in three words, and “Who Said That?” — a mini-quiz where guests hear a quote from the news and try to figure out who said it. 
It also includes interactive listener segments: Sanders often calls a listener local to a city where major news is happening, bringing a necessary perspective on news stories that often lose the emotion that comes with large changes to one’s city. 
For Sanders, it isn’t about what a major politician or local official says about an issue, but what normal American citizens have to say about it. 
The Weeds
With episodes every Tuesday and Friday, this Vox podcast isn’t concerned with always covering the latest or talking about the election horse race. Instead, it aims to put the news of today in context, to contextualize today’s biggest headlines and engage in deep discussions about complex policies. 
For example, some of its most recent episodes are discussions on “Medicare for All” and universal childcare plans. While the two have become well-known features of some Democratic candidates’ campaign promises, most news coverage only mentions it as an idea; few of them actually dig deeper into the issue to explore feasibility, specific policy ideas or cost. On “The Weeds,” Vox’s hosts do just that — avoid surface-level conversations about politics and campaigning in favor of specific, policy-based discussion. 
While this focus might make the podcast dry to some listeners, the show’s personalities keep it from becoming boring. Vox senior correspondents Matt Yglesias, Dara Lind and Sara Kliff, senior political reporter Jane Coaston and editor-in-chief Ezra Klein all host the show in various rotations and bring a lighter mood to otherwise uninteresting topics. 
They also have “Weeds in the Wild” episodes, where they conduct person-on-street interviews with Americans who would be most affected by certain policies or decisions.

The Joint Provost/Academic Senate Task Force on Sexual Harassment will present its final report to University administration in the next few weeks. Formed in the wake of a National Academies report examining sexual harassment in STEM academia, the task force seeks to develop recommendations that will create a zero-tolerance, respectful environment at USC, according to Provost Michael Quick. Given that one of its main objectives is to assess the “unique power dynamics” in relationships between faculty and doctoral students, it is impossible for the task force to ignore current regulations that do not prevent romantic relationships between students and faculty.
The 2018 Faculty Handbook “strongly discourages” sexual relationships between students and professors and acknowledges the pitfalls of such relationships. This statement’s wording is a recommendation, however. This choice renders the handbook powerless as a safeguard against impropriety because it lacks concrete directives. While the handbook does require faculty members to recuse themselves from teaching or supervising their significant others, preempting conflicts of interest fall short of prohibiting relationships altogether.
As a result of the incongruity of the Handbook’s intentions and its actual policies, the University not only fails to give clear direction regarding romantic relationships between faculty and students, but also renders students vulnerable to unequal and coercive treatment. To combat sexual harassment, the joint task force must advocate for a blanket ban on student-faculty romantic relationships.
A student-faculty relationship subjects the student to an inherently imbalanced power dynamic. The faculty member’s institutional power grants them influence over other faculty members and University officials. If the faculty member and the student are part of the same academic program at USC, the faculty member can significantly influence the student’s university experience and career prospects. Any power imbalance entails a lack of true consent, so a student-faculty relationship would not only be unequal but also vulnerable to abuse.
Some might argue that banning such relationships infantilizes consenting adults by depriving them of sexual agency. In a 2017 paper against blanket bans, University of Manitoba associate professor Neil McArthur asserts that when both partners are adults, power dynamics shouldn’t infringe on their rights to engage in a relationship.  He writes that the perception that unequal relationships negate consent is an egalitarian, subjective moral judgment. He argues that banning student-faculty romantic relationships imposes morality onto private intimate behavior, rendering it tantamount to prohibiting same-sex intimacy or abortions.
What McArthur dismisses as a moral judgment, however, is actually a documented reality consisting of many incidents of abuse. From 2010 to 2011, the University of British Columbia’s creative writing chair Steven Galloway had an affair a student in his department. A 2015 investigation found that the student’s failure to object to Galloway’s inappropriate sexual comments and advances was a result of unequal power dynamics. 
The University must recognize that the ramifications posed by an unequal power dynamic are not distant hypotheticals ­— they are real, inevitable and serious. As evident in USC professor Erick Guerrero’s alleged sexual harassment encounter with graduate student Karissa Fenwick, sexual injustice within the context of student-faculty relationships is not only costly to USC’s finances and reputation but also the trust that its students put in the University. USC has no room for failure; it must do everything in its power to protect students from sexual harassment, assault and abuse.
As long as the Faculty Handbook’s stance against student-faculty relationships remains vague and open to a wide variety of interpretations, unscrupulous individuals will continue to exploit loopholes in regulation to their advantage. It is incumbent on the joint task force to draft a recommendation demanding the explicit prohibition of all student-faculty romantic relationships. and when students and faculty build relationships primarily focused on academic discourse and professionalism, USC can shift away from a culture of harassment and toward a culture of respect.

Over the weekend, Sen. Dianne Feinstein made headlines for lecturing children and other young climate activists who were asking her to vote “yes” on the proposed Green New Deal, an ambitious resolution that aims to create jobs and stimulate the economy while tackling climate change head on. One young activist can be heard in a video of the confrontation with Feinstein saying that scientists have said there are only 12 more years to “turn this around.”
“Well, it’s not going to get turned around in 10 years,” Feinstein responded. 
But not with that attitude. Humans need to band together and create tangible change to avoid the catastrophe staring us in the face. Simple lifestyle changes — like washing your dishes differently — can leave a significant impact. 
So, what is the best way to wash your dishes? By hand? With the dishwasher? Leaving them out in your backyard and waiting for heavy rainfall?
Well, probably the third option, but that’s not too realistic. 
The best and most feasible option, hands down, is to ditch the hand-washing. 
To begin with, dishwashers minimize water use.
“Studies are showing more and more that, when used to maximize energy-saving features, modern dishwashers can outperform all but the most frugal hand-washers,” the American Council for an Energy Efficient Economy website said. 
How much water you’re actually using by hand-washing is easy to measure. Instead of letting the water run down the drain, put a bucket in the sink and see how much water it collects. You may be surprised. 
Most modern dishwashers use less than 10 gallons of water per cycle, and standard-size dishwashers made on or after May 30, 2013 are required to use only five gallons of water, per Department of Energy regulations. Compact dishwashers use even less — at three gallons per cycle. 
Not only do dishwashers almost always use less water than hand-washing, but they’re also more sanitary. To properly sanitize dishes, water needs to be around 140 degrees, too hot for most people’s hands. What’s more, dishwashing sponges are often teeming with bacteria. 
It’s important to use your dishwasher properly to maximize its energy and water efficiency. Loading the dishwasher correctly is a critical step. Though you should wait until the dishwasher has a full load, Consumer Reports warns against overfilling it, which can lead to dishes breaking and preventing water flow between the dishes. 
And skip the pre-rinsing by hand before loading the dishwasher. If you’re like me, it can be hard to resist scrubbing dried pasta sauce out of your bowl before putting it in the dishwasher. But this step is unnecessary and leads to water waste, in addition to energy wasted to heat water.
Modern dishwashers can handle dried foods — just scrape off the plate before putting it in the dishwasher. In fact, pre-rinsing your dishes can actually lead to dirtier dishes, according to Consumer Reports.
The fanciest dishwashers use a sensor to determine the cleanliness of the water in the machine. When the water is clean, the washing ceases. 
“If you’ve already rinsed off much of the muck, the sensor misreads the dishes as already fairly clean,” the Consumer Reports website reads. 
So, loading your dishwasher efficiently and washing a full but not overcrowded dishwasher is the most sustainable choice for cleaning your dishes.
In terms of changing your lifestyle to be more sustainable, loading your dishwasher with relatively dirty dishes seems like a pretty simple choice. I’m sure even Feinstein could get behind it.
