Spring football is in full effect on the USC campus. Last Saturday, the USC football team held its first scrimmage at the Coliseum. With the clock counting down until the conclusion of spring practice and the imminent season opener on Sept. 1, now is the time for the Trojans to start prepping for the future.
Though not one single snap has been taken, one can’t help but wonder who will follow in senior quarterback Matt Barkley’s footsteps. Who will be the understudy to the Heisman hopeful? Who will be the next leader of the USC Trojans?

Sure, the Trojans have time to spare before deciding the successor to Barkley, but it is necessary to take advantage of every opportunity to provide an adequate amount of experience before throwing the heir to the Trojan empire into the pack.
Redshirt freshman quarterback Cody Kessler seems the most likely to inherit the job. Kessler, who hails from Centennial High School in Bakersfield, Calif., is listed at 6-foot-1 and 210 pounds. Some have likened his talent to former USC quarterback Mark Sanchez. Though Kessler has not logged time for the Trojans because he redshirted during the 2011 season, he is primed to have his chance in the spotlight. Prep All-American, Kessler, whose play style is similar to that of the current USC offense, would be an easy fit in the offensive scheme.
But Kessler isn’t the only redshirt freshman making a name for himself. Max Wittek, the 6-foot-4 quarterback, is a product of high school powerhouse Santa Ana Mater Dei (and was teammates with current players Barkley, Holmes and Blackwell). An All-American, Wittek was also a member of the All-Trinity first team during his senior year as he completed 153 of 282 passes (54.3 percent) for 2,252 yards with 24 touchdowns and 15 interceptions.
In the Trojans’ first spring scrimmage, Wittek seemed right at home in the pocket. It is undeniable that Wittek possesses what the Trojan offense might need in the future — a strong arm and mobility. Like Kessler, Wittek redshirted during the 2011 season.
With the abundance of attention fixed on whether it will be Kessler or Wittek as the official backup quarterback, many forget that another prime candidate is still in the Kiffin arsenal.
Redshirt sophomore Jesse Scroggins hasn’t had the best of luck at USC. The 6-foot-2 quarterback was sidelined for the majority of the 2011 season after suffering an injury to his hand and thumb. Scroggins, a product of Lakewood High School, did appear in one game for the Trojans, although only for the final snap in the home duel against Washington. The All-American Scroggins, like Kessler and Wittek, has yet to throw a single pass (in a game) for the Trojans.
The top three candidates have little experience behind the Trojan offensive line. Now is the time, however, to properly evaluate all three quarterbacks and determine which will be the best fit. With some players possessing similar play styles, USC can utilize a system that will incorporate the best of both worlds and take advantage of all the various talents.
Spring practice is the most vital for the future of the Trojan offense. Every decision now sets the stage for the future of the USC football program. Allowing enough time to have the successor(s) gain confidence in their respective craft is crucial and necessary.
Though some might claim it is too early to start prepping for next season, it is in the best interest of the USC football program. Whoever will be serving as backup to Barkley in 2012 needs to be prepared for any situation. Without a doubt, the decision needs to be sensible, but not rushed.

With yet another victory yesterday, USC men’s tennis wrapped up nonconference play unscathed and is looking ready for Pac-12 action.
The No. 1 Trojans (19-0) took down No. 42 Boise State              (16-6) yesterday in a 6-1 victory at Marks Stadium to extend their win streak to 39 matches dating to February 2011.
No. 24 sophomore Ray Sarmiento clinched the win for the Trojans with a 6-1, 6-2 victory over No. 55 Damian Hume for a 4-0 USC advantage.
The Trojans’ first singles win came from freshman Roberto Quiroz, who defeated Nathan Sereke 6-1, 6-4 for his seventh straight singles win.
No. 16 senior Daniel Nguyen then ousted No. 48 James Meredith 6-2, 6-1 on court one for a 2-0 USC lead.
Nguyen, who was named the Pac-12 Player of the Week and has won 10 straight singles matches, cited the home crowd as a significant factor in his success.
“It’s great having the support from the home crowd,” Nguyen said. “All my friends and family came out, and it really boosts you up during the match.”
With the victory in hand, freshman Jordi Vives fell in a third set tiebreak to Boise State’s Scott Sears for the Broncos’ only point and Vives’ first dual match loss in singles this season.
Afterward, No. 30 freshman Yannick Hanfmann and freshman Eric Johnson both took their respective singles matches.
Hanfmann overcame Andrew Bettles 4-6, 7-6 (4), 1-0 (11-9), while Johnson defeated Filipp Pogostkin 7-5, 6-4.
Senior Steve Johnson and sophomore Emilio Gomez, ranked No. 2 and No. 41 in the nation, respectively, sat out from singles play. Johnson, who has won 51 consecutive singles matches, took a rest to nurse a sore shoulder.
Johnson took the court in doubles action with Quiroz, where they earned USC’s first win with an 8-4 finish over Meredith and Sereke. That left the other two USC pairs battling for the clinching point.
Both Trojan duos broke for 7-6 leads over their opponents, and Gomez and Hanfmann were able to pull away for an 8-6 win over Andrew Bettles and Filipp Pogostkin to clinch USC’s double point.
On court 2, Boise State’s Hume and Sears managed to battle back for a 7-7 tie against Nguyen and Sarmiento, who are ranked No. 21 in doubles. The two sides battled it out into a tiebreak, with the USC pair prevailing 9-8 (4).
“We really prepared ourselves for these matches,” Nguyen said. “We did a lot of running this last week, like 10 miles. We prepare ourselves to play long battles.”
Nguyen’s doubles partner shared similar sentiments.
“As a team, I think we’re physically fit,” Sarmiento said. “We’re top in the country and ready for the match to go the long distance.”
USC is now 5-0 all-time against the Broncos.
The Trojans will begin Pac-12 play with a four-game road trip, starting in Seattle, Wash., to face No. 17 Washington on Friday at 1:30 p.m.

After dropping both games of a doubleheader on Sunday at No. 2 Stanford, USC baseball managed to come away with an 8-4 win in the series finale last night.
Freshman pitcher Stephen Tarpley was impressive, going 6 1/3 strong innings, allowing two runs on eight hits, with no walks to his two strikeouts and lowering his ERA to 3.25.
It wasn’t exactly high-stress pitching for Tarpley. USC (14-8, 2-4) put up five runs in the first inning and never lost the lead. But that’s not to say they didn’t look back.
Clutch · The finale against Stanford was a pitcher’s duel, in which senior pitcher Andrew Triggs (above) held the Cardinal scoreless for six innings. - Corey Marquetti | Daily Trojan
Stanford (15-3, 2-1) got two back in the second, but then both teams were shut out for the next six innings. In the eighth, the Cardinal scored two runs with only one out, but the Trojan bullpen got out of the inning with the lead intact. Three insurance runs in the top of the ninth made it a stress-free last three outs for the Trojans.
“Going one-and-two is not what you want,” USC coach Frank Cruz said. “They stole those first two from us. But obviously it’s better to not get swept.”
Game one on Saturday was a classic pitcher’s duel. USC senior pitcher Andrew Triggs held the Cardinal scoreless for six innings but was matched by his Stanford counterpart Mark Appel, one of the top prospects in the upcoming MLB draft. Appel allowed just one hit in the first six innings, Triggs three. But after being sent down in order for four consecutive innings, the Cardinal broke the deadlock in the seventh with a pair of singles and an RBI-groundout.
Trailing by one and down to their last out in the ninth with Appel still on the mound, the Trojans got back-to-back hits, including a double from senior catcher Kevin Roundtree to put runners on second and third. Up stepped walk-on sophomore infielder Kevin Swick. Down to his last strike, Swick smacked a two-RBI single up the middle to dramatically vault the Trojans into the lead.
It appeared for a moment that Swick would be the hero. But with Triggs still on the mound in the bottom of the ninth, the Cardinal got a leadoff double, a groundout that advanced the runner to third and a sacrifice fly to tie the game. After a single, Stanford right fielder Austin Wilson smacked a crushing, walk-off two-run home run to give the Cardinal a 4-2 victory.
“In hindsight, I still would have left Triggs in,” Cruz said. “He’d only thrown 84 pitches going into the ninth; he’d been pitching really well. He’s our guy.”
Triggs went a complete 8 2/3 innings, allowing four runs on 10 hits, but was bettered by Appel. The potential first-round draft pick went all nine innings, allowing just two runs on six hits, with seven strikeouts to just two walks.
The nightcap of the doubleheader was a similarly crushing loss. Stanford put two up in the first inning, and the score stayed at 2-0 until the Trojans got one back in the fifth. Senior starter Ben Mount gave up one more run before departing after six innings of work.
USC stayed down 3-1 until the eighth, when the team loaded the bases with one out. But after getting one run across, a deflating double play groundout ended the inning and left the tying and go-ahead runs in scoring position.
Freshman second baseman Dante Flores led off the ninth with a solid single and was bunted over to second, but a pair of flyouts ended the game.
“We have to play better,” Cruz said. “We can’t keep losing series.”
USC travels to UC Irvine on Wednesday, before continuing conference play at Washington State next weekend.
Caption caught me as well, saw it on my phone along with an alert from my SC app that read: “Baseball Final Score USC 4 Stanford 8” what a mess.  So after reading artical, (oh yea), Trojans avoid sweep but on Tarpley’s arm! Triggs is a STUD but I was shocked to believe he threw another game so soon.
The caption under the picture is misleading and inaccurate. Does anyone pay attention to details?
Too bad it is not ready for the Football scrimmage on the 14th. Trojans would have a record attendance!

An investigation is underway into the disappearance of a student who left the university after last semester, Los Angeles County Sheriff’s detective Tamar Abraham said.
Elgin Stafford, 23, who was last seen on March 20 leaving his home in Carson, was pursuing a graduate degree in public diplomacy. Stafford received his Bachelor’s degree from UC Berkeley.
Vice President for Student Affairs Michael L. Jackson said he became aware of Elgin’s disappearance on Monday.
Searching · Elgin Stafford has been missing since March 20. - Ani Kolangian | Daily Trojan
Jackson said the school is working to gather more information about Stafford’s disappearance.
“We are trying to figure out what happened,” Jackson said. “Right now, we are all concerned. We hope that he turns up safe.”
Stafford, a 5-foot-10 black male who weighs 145 pounds, was last seen in a dark jacket, a black shirt and multi-colored pants.
The Dept. of Public Safety is not involved in the investigation, said David Carlisle, DPS captain for training and media relations.
“We will certainly assist the Sheriff’s Department in any way that we can,” Carlisle said.
Though Abraham said she could not provide details about the investigation, she said that the sheriff’s department is eliciting public assistance.
“It’s an ongoing investigation,” Abraham said. “He hasn’t been located. We will take any help we can get.”
Anyone with information about Stafford is asked to call the sheriff’s department at (323) 890-5500.

A recent study from the Pew Research Center found that a record 51 percent of Americans believe that religious conservatives have too much control over the GOP.
The economy was previously the key divider between Republicans and Democrats, but social issues are starting to gain a stronger hold, according to the poll.
Dr. Patrick Whelan, an assistant professor of pediatrics and National President of Catholic Democrats, said the shift toward social issues began in the 1980s.
“This shift has been going on for 30 years, starting when presidential candidate Ronald Reagan’s team engineered this strategy to corral religious conservatives,” Whelan said. “The 1980 abortion votes were indistinguishable between Democrats and Republicans.”
Kaya Masler, president of USC Students for Barack Obama and political director of USC College Democrats, said the problem facing the Republican Party is their fractured views on social issues.
“The Republicans are looking for a basis of unity; however, social issues do not unite the conservative party the way that they unite liberals,” Masler said. “Republicans are linked by fiscal policy more so than social issues.”
MacKenzie Gansert, a Republican freshman majoring in English, said politicians focus on social issues because there are normally only two sides to social issues.
“Staying away from education, economics and foreign policy is easier because social issues can be separated into black and white, and therefore a definite side can be chosen, making the candidate appear stronger,” Gansert said.
The Republican Party needs to shift its attention away from religious issues and focus more on the economy and fiscal policy, said Alex Kludjian, a Republican freshman majoring in political science.
“The Republican Party, through pandering to evangelicals, is not moving the party in the right direction,” Kludjian said. “The positions of social conservatives tend to be more restrictive. We are supposed to be a party of expanding freedoms.”

View Roundup 03-27 in a larger map
Crimes against a person
At 5:30 p.m. on March 25, DPS officers responded to a report of a suspect having punched an employee inside Starbucks and detained him for investigation.  The employee said the suspect was causing a disturbance and punched him in the shoulder when he attempted to escort the suspect out of the store.  The suspect was arrested and transported to Metropolitan Detention Center for booking.
At 12:04 a.m. on March 25, DPS officers responded to a report of a suspect threatening two students at McDonald’s.  The students were hiding in a restroom when the officers arrived and they said the suspect threatened to harm them without provocation while they were waiting in line for food.  The suspect left the location while the students were hiding and could not be located during a subsequent search of the area.  The officers then escorted the students to their residence.

Los Angeles Mayor and Chair of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority Antonio Villaraigosa announced Friday that Phase I of the Expo Line will open on Saturday, April 28.
All aboard · Phase I of the Expo Line is scheduled to open on April 28. The line will run from Downtown Los Angeles to Culver City. Phase II, expected to completed in 2015, will offer service to Santa Monica. - Phoebe Pan | Daily Trojan
The Expo Line runs adjacent to the University Park Campus on Exposition Boulevard and connects Culver City and Downtown Los Angeles. The line is 8.6 miles long and it will serve 12 stations, two of which are shared with the Blue Line, which runs between Downtown Los Angeles and Long Beach. The Expo line is expected to transport 27,000 passengers daily, according to Metro.
“The opening of Expo Line Phase I is a critical step towards creating the multi-faceted transit network that Angelenos deserve,” Villaraigosa said in a press release.
The line will run seven days a week and is expected to operate from 5 a.m. to 12:30 a.m.
Rick Jager, a Metro media relations representative, said it is likely that Metro will offer free rides on the new Expo Line during its opening weekend, April 28 and April 29.
“It will take board approval but in years past, every time we open up a line, we offer free rides on the weekend. [Villaraigosa] indicated that it looked like we would give free rides away on the opening weekend of the Expo Line,” Jager said.
To prepare for regular service when the line opens and integration with Blue Line service, Metro has begun testing the trains along the Expo Line seven days a week from 4:30 a.m. to 1:30 a.m., an increase from previous tests, which ran from approximately 11 a.m. to 1 a.m.
USC students need to be cautious when crossing the train tracks with the increase in testing, Jager said.
“Students need to be aware that from now until April 28 there will be testing,” Jager said.
Phase II of the Expo Line is expected to be completed in 2015, according to Metro. This addition will extend the Expo Line from Culver City to Santa Monica.
Keep in mind that this new line does not connect the USC area only to Downtown, but to every other point on the Metrorail network in Los Angeles County.  Metrorail is currently the fifth most extensive one in the United States, and is going to get bigger, probably up to the second most extensive within 10 years.  As of April 28th, you’ll be able to get on a train and go to NoHo, Hollywood, Koreatown, Pasadena, Long Beach, El Segundo, and dozens of other places in between.  Three other expansions coming on line within 4 years also.
Awesome I can’t wait to start using this.  Forget my car!!  Three stops near USC will really be a huge change.

President C. L. Max Nikias spoke at a Graduate Student Government Senate meeting Monday about the importance of graduate students as leaders of the university.
“As Trojans, you are natural leaders,” Nikias said. “Leadership is more than a title. … It is a responsibility to ourselves to be responsible to others at all times in moments great and small.”
This kind of graduate student leadership, Nikias said, has led the university to implement more programs benefiting graduate students in the past year.
Future · President C. L. Max Nikias spoke about USC’s goals for graduate programs at the Graduate Student Government’s meeting on Monday. - Ani Kolangian | Daily Trojan
USC spends $20 million annually on graduate programs, Nikias said. He, specifically, cited supplemental funding the USC graduate school will offer doctoral students for presenting research at conferences, attending seminars and workshops and pursuing publication of their work.
“Take full advantage of these programs,” Nikias said. “I wish I had them when I was a Ph.D. student.”
Nikias also said he is working to attract more world-renowned faculty to match the academic excellence he sees in USC graduate students.
“In any organization, the quality of the organization is all about the quality of the people. In a university, it’s the quality of the faculty and the quality of the students,” Nikias said.
Over the past two years, USC has added 441 scholars to its faculty as assistant professors or professors.
Nikias’ appreciation of graduate students extended past academics. He said he next plans to tackle the issue of graduate student housing to enhance their university experience.
“If you ask me what is the biggest need we have as a university, it is graduate student housing,” Nikias said.
He hopes to solve this problem by adding 3,000 new spaces for graduate students in the redeveloped Village at USC. A graduate student village within the complex is also among Nikias’ plans.
Many students said they were impressed by the headway Nikias has made with his high ambitions for the university.
“Nikias has shown tremendous fundraising initiative in terms of start of the art facilities and professors,” GSG Director of Academic Affairs Jaclyn Selby said. “And I’m very glad he restated his commitment to community partners and our Trojan neighbors moving forward.”
Others said they admired his guiding ethical principles.
“Overall, he is doing a good job and making the right decisions,” Phil Wu, a graduate student studying medicine and a GSG senator, said. “He has to be objective in his job, which can be difficult.”
Regardless of his many goals for USC, Nikias said the growth of students themselves remains his biggest focus.
“At the end of the day, as president, I feel I am the guardian of core values at USC,” Nikias said. “Commit yourself to being a great leader.”
The Daily Trojan is truly a lap dog!
Your editor needs to find a new profession. He/She has failed at this one–Truth and Dialtectic is dead. you know what I am talking about–nothing negative about Max or USC–WOW! Pathetic. From now on, I will only praise the Commisar! All hail censorship and denial of discussion. Long live fascism: China and Israel–that’s what did it huh? Israel–what a bunch of pusilanimous pussies–no guts, no story: Disgraceful.
Since you won’t publish my comments, I will take them to my Alumni group and read them there and let them know that the DT is bought and sold–just like Max, USC, and you–the DT, no doubt comes cheap.
I’ve never been so embarrassed to be a Trojan.
Core Values? Ethics?
Why are some of our biggest Partners also some of the biggest violators of human rights on the plant (according to Amnesty International) CHINA and ISRAEL–Who’s next Max–North Korea and Myanmar?
We are judging you by your actions Max, not your words. Let’s see some leadership in Truth, Values ,and Ethics not just words. Anyone who wants to “Run a Marathon at a Sprinters Pace” is bound to make some big mistakes. I hope you slow down, Max. This 24/7 huckstering of USC is not only unseemly but also dangerous–as shown by some of your more dubious decisions lately. I know you have to kiss a lot frogs to raise all that money you want, Max–but there has to be some limits.
We are all watching–not everyone is cheering the changes you are making. Take the “For Sale Sign” off of a few things, Max. Please.

Do you still spend hundreds of dollars on textbooks and course readers at the start of a new semester?
According to College Board, in 2011-12 the national average textbook costs at non-profit four-year on-campus universities was $1,213.
With the advent of digital media and mobile technology, the trend of paperback textbooks and printouts is a declining practice. The remarkable evolution from ink to pixels now causes most university students to access digital, rather than print, when reading course materials.
According to the National Association of College Stores, digital textbooks are expected to account for a 500 percent year-on-year increase in market share in reference to the course materials sold in fall 2012.
Cost-effective e-textbooks and materials make the option for students to go digital vital, as opposed to lugging hard-copy textbooks around campus. The student digital services offered by Amazon and other publishers leveraging cloud-based e-book distribution is already making electronic reading a ubiquitous student experience.
Recently, Encyclopaedia Britannica announced that it is ceasing publication of print editions and going digital-only. This is a big step for a company that has been in the printing business since 1768. In a world of infinite and instant knowledge, a $1,395 32-volume hardcover library that’s outdated the moment you crease the spine is destined to have plummeting sales.
Just a few days after the release of the much-anticipated new iPad 2, a Pearson Foundation study revealed that students believe tablets and other mobile devices will transform learning.
According to the study, among college students who own tablets, the iPad is the most popular (63 percent), followed by the Kindle Fire (26 percent) and Samsung Galaxy Tab (15 percent). These numbers certainly point to increasing popularity in digital readership among students.
With the ease and interactive features of e-book readers, mobile devices and tablets, students can experience improved retention and a wider variety of information media such as video or online media.
Not to mention, students tend to learn not only while seeing and reading, but also by doing. A perfect example of this would be when professors create custom apps and online blackboards to conduct skills evaluation, conduct virtual office hours and discussion sessions, or accept and grade assignments online. Classroom participation and annotation with skeleton notes is one of the assets that digital content provides. No doubt, students always find digital content easy to share as compared to the conventional paper notes.
“There are many advantages to go for soft copies of academic materials,” said Pankaj Rajak, a graduate student studying materials science. “One of my favorite feature[s] is that they give me the ability to search within the text, unlike the printed edition.”
Instead of boring static images, the incorporation of video, audio, interactive simulations, animations and even 360-degree visualizations and panoramas is definitely a boon for students and is reinventing the academic curriculum. Such interactive digital content is transforming passive learners into active participants in courses, thereby maximizing student engagement.
USC appears to be well aware of this evolution in e-textbooks and has continually updated its subscriptions to educational databases and purchased additional e-resources. USC Libraries is also planning to roll out an iPad checkout program to encourage student research.
If the trend continues, our backpacks might get lighter — and our wallets might retain their weight.

The link between the concept of behavioral economics and college students is critical thinking, the ability to gather relevant information from different fields of study to help us make a rational decision.
Christina Ellis | Daily Trojan
While most universities include critical thinking in their mission statements, it is essential for USC to provide more opportunities for students to improve their critical thinking and to carry those skills over into the professional world.
Economic theories are mostly built upon the assumption that people act rationally in their own self-interest. Economists have never pretended that they can predict individual behavior, but economic theories do a pretty good job of predicting how groups of people will act. Even Adam Smith’s “invisible hand” theory is predicated upon the idea that markets are controlled by people acting in their own self-interest.
Professor Fernando Zapatero, the inaugural holder of the Robert G. Kirby Chair in Behavioral Finance, teaches behavioral finance classes at the Marshall School of Business. To find the connection between behavioral economics and our everyday life, I interviewed Zapatero. He cited a specific example to explain how the Japanese have used knowledge of behavioral economics to analyze a financial market and help people make investment decisions. Japan is an aging country, and aging issues affect the country’s economy, saving mechanisms, price and investment products.
As a result, by analyzing people’s motivations, many  Japanese businessmen and technicians worked together and developed robotics to help improve senior care.
Zapatero has noticed that many of his students were able to solve complicated financial models like the Capital Asset Pricing Model, a model that describes the relationship between risk and expected return. But Zapatero has also noticed they are unable to explain some economic failures, such as the European economic crisis.
“The world is moving fast today, and students need to learn critical thinking skills to help them predict and understand how things are going to change and adjust situations correspondingly,” Zapatero said.
It only takes about 20 minutes in a shopping mall during a sales season, however, to dispel any notion that buying behavior is rational.
In Models of Man, Herbert Simon, Nobel Prize-winning economist, explains that people operate in an environment of “bounded rationality,” which means we never have perfect information and our behavior is therefore based on doing the best we can with what we know. He calls this phenomenon “satisficing.” But even when we have good information, we still act irrationally in some situations.
One of the puzzles that behavioral economics could help solve is what motivates people to make irrational decisions, by combining economics with the knowledge of other academic fields. Academic fields, such as anthropology and psychology, build a necessary bridge between traditional economic theories and real life human factors, both of which are key in the decision making processes.
Similar to many other business schools, Marshall places a strong emphasis on a number-based education.
Zapatero commented that many students would like more space in their class schedules to take classes outside their majors to expand their fields of study and have more opportunities to develop their critical thinking.
Faced with a global economy, driven by information and technology, one has to be able to deal with changes quickly and effectively.
The new economy places increasing demands on students’ ability to critically and creatively think as they head into a constantly evolving and increasingly competitive job market.
At the end of the day, it is crucial to realize that there is a gap between what we learn at school and the constantly changing job environment. Critical thinking skills would help us fill in the gap between the classroom and the real world and, thus, enable us to think well and solve problems systematically.
Therefore, students should have more options on campus to improve their critical thinking skills, which would be beneficial for their future study and career.

The trial of Dharun Ravi, a Rutgers University student accused of spying on and harassing his gay roommate in 2010, is not just a story of cyberbullying and possible homophobia. It is also a story that teaches us that in the age of social media we will be held publicly accountable for our private actions.
Max Rubin | Daily Trojan
On March 16, Ravi was convicted on 15 counts, the most severe of which was a bias intimidation charge. In September 2010, Ravi used a webcam to spy on his roommate, Tyler Clementi, while Clementi was on a date with another man. The bias intimidation charge deems Ravi’s behavior a hate crime driven by sexual orientation biases.
Clementi, who learned of Ravi’s actions after the fact, committed suicide shortly after the incident, on Sept. 22, 2010.
Even after exploring the facts presented in the media, it is difficult to affirm whether Ravi acted out of prejudice against Clementi.
The case paints a telling portrait of the consequences that come with a lack of awareness: The information that we put online immediately and irreversibly becomes part of an open, public space.
When Clementi asked Ravi to have the room to himself on Sept. 21, Ravi posted a tweet daring his friends to access his webcam and peek in on his roommate, just as he had done two days before.
In an interview with The Star-Ledger Thursday, Ravi said, “I knew my friends would think it was a joke because they know my sense of humor.”
In a “Letter to the Editor” in The New York Times, one man commented, “Mr. Ravi was an adult and unquestionably malicious and hateful in his actions.”
In an interview with Chris Cuomo, co-anchor of 20/20, however, Ravi denied such accusations, saying that he had assumed the tweet would only be read by his friends.
“We’re not really thinking about, you know, if someone else reads this, how are they going to feel,” Ravi said.
The trial and conviction reveals that people should think about the consequences of posting private information online, even if they’re just trying to get a laugh out of it.
Ravi’s Twitter account, though, was public and Clementi himself looked at it 38 times in the two days leading up to his suicide. Since the story first broke in 2010, people from all over the world have been exposed to these tweets.
Regardless of Ravi’s motives, there is a larger lesson to be learned from this.
The many social media websites, such as Twitter, that govern and drive our everyday lives are undeniably public places. By publishing our thoughts on such websites, we are converting private musings into public information.
As a result, we might need to answer for these private statements in the public realm. People who have never met us before — other students, co-workers, potential employees — might judge our characters based on what we post, even if we only mean it as a “joke.”
We live in an age in which the private and the public spheres are blurring together, and the consequences of which are not yet certain.

It was the first cable show to take home the Emmy for outstanding drama series three years in a row and last September, Mad Men did it again. It sired a wave of nostalgia that one backward-facing period drama after another hoped to ride into the ratings’ promised land.
The show’s ratings are by no means modest for cable — its season five premiere Sunday reached 3.5 million, the highest ratings in the show’s history — but to put that in perspective, a typical episode of American Idol for this season reaches around 20 million viewers. Mad Men might never have the mass appeal required to sustain an audience on one of the major broadcast networks, but the show enjoys a measure of cultural significance that arguably no other television program comes close to rivaling.
Even if Mad Men never breaks the double-digits in terms of the millions of eyes tuning in on Sundays, there’s no denying that the show is a certifiable trendsetter. In the wake of its fanatically anticipated two-hour return — if ever there were a case of absence making the heart grow fonder, this was it — it’s hard not to consider what, if anything, Mad Men is doing with all its cultural power.
Surely Mad Men’s greatest contribution to the pop cultural landscape is the rash of “retrophilia” that the show inspired in fans when it burst onto the scene in 2007. Roughly around the time Mad Men began edging its way into America’s heart, a national fascination with bygone eras — the 1960s, in particular — manifested in decisions ranging from outfit choices to TV programming schedules.
Credit for the long-overdue revival of interest in classic cocktails has to be given at least in part to the boozy workplace environment depicted in the show. What Sex and the City did for the Cosmo, Mad Men did for just about everything stiffer. To some extent, sartorial choices not just on the runway but also in fans’ day-to-day wardrobe choices began to reflect the style, sophistication and level of care suggested by Mad Men costume designer Janie Bryant’s impeccable attiring of characters on the show.
Studio executives have also gotten swept up in the flurry of whiskey-tinged nostalgia: We’ll never know exactly what was said in the pitch meetings for shows like Pan Am and the ill-fated The Playboy Club, but there isn’t the feeblest doubt in my mind that Mad Men was mentioned as a reference point when the idea for those sorts of retro-glamorous shows were being sold to ABC and NBC, respectively.
Considering its setting in the 1960s, Mad Men has taken some flack for its typically superficial engagement with the premier social issue of the day, segregation.
Don Draper’s (Jon Hamm) interaction with a black waiter named Sam in the first scene of the pilot episode seemed to suggest that race would play a justifiably large role in the historically set series, but the coming seasons failed to make good on the implicit promise: When the show has touched on race relations in the past, it’s typically been only in passing.
Creator and executive producer Matthew Weiner most likely made the creative choice to focus on his characters, rather than the socio political climate, early in the execution of his concept — and the decision is more than defensible.
The complexities of the show’s ever-changing romantic relationships, workplace dynamics and sexual politics are sufficiently engaging to keep audiences tuning in without the added gimmick of the 1960s. In many episodes, the time period feels almost incidental to the timelessness of the human drama that plays out every week.
As New York Magazine TV critic Matt Zoller Seitz put it, “The show’s main draw is behavior, observed with such exactness that one can imagine the show’s being transposed to the forties or eighties, with different clothes, slang and inebriants, but still delivering the same basic satisfactions.”
And Mad Men has delivered those “same basic satisfactions” almost unfailingly for four seasons now. But to continue with only the infrequent obligatory nod to the realities of life in the 1960s would be to bury in the sand the head of a smart show that prides itself on incisiveness.
That’s why Sunday’s season five premiere, bookended as it was with scenes addressing the way in which the simmering tensions of the civil rights movement began to come to a head in the later 1960s, was particularly promising. The series seems poised to tackle issues that it has largely skirted around in the past.
For a show as influential and trendsetting as Mad Men is, what it chooses to represent on-screen is almost a political move. If the pervasiveness of retro-fever for the ’60s is any indication, Mad Men packs quite a punch in setting the pop cultural agenda. Fedoras off to Mad Men for making good on the responsibility that comes with that amount of cultural clout.

Diggy Simmons has hip-hop in his blood.
His father is Joseph Simmons, aka Rev Run, a member of Run-DMC and one of the biggest hip-hop artists in music history, and Diggy’s uncle is Russell Simmons, one of the biggest hip-hop moguls in the music business. With these genes, he’s seemingly destined for greatness.

But Diggy did not simply ride the coattails of his elders’ successes; with ambition and talent, he has shown that he can stand on his own.
Diggy started a blog, “Life of the Jet Setter,” which helped him create his own fan base known as “jetsetters.” He posted his freestyle over the Nas track “Made You Look,” catching the attention of hip-hop listeners everywhere and prompting Kanye West to re-post the video on his blog.
Despite the pressure of big-name artist cosigns, debut hype and the family name, Diggy steps up to the plate, with Unexpected Arrival delivering one of the most bold albums any 17-year-old rapper could.
Diggy puts this confidence on display right away on the early tracks of the album. He officially announces his arrival on the track “Hello World,” full of stadium-sounding drums and a distorted voice yelling strongly “I’m here, and I’m here to stay” on the hook.
Simmons continues this show of swagger and confidence with “88,” in which he raps about rising to fame and fortune that could be traced back to 1988 even though he wasn’t born yet. Jadakiss brings his signature gritty rapping style to the song as well, describing his own life and financial success in 1988 when he was just 13 years old, ending his verse saying, “I’m still spending money that’s 24 years old.”
This confidence comes through especially on songs focused on girls, and none does this better than the lead single, “Do It Like You,” featuring singer Jeremih.
Diggy raps to his dream girl about how she leaves everyone else in the dust with the way she carries herself. He even lets out a bit of a serenade when he sings, “You’re such boss but carry yourself like a lady / The baddest out ya crew and that is not up for debating.” Though Diggy acknowledges that it seems “every rapper only wants that sexual healing / Marvin Gaye,” he makes a pretty convincing argument that he wants her for much more than that.
Lyrically, Unexpected Arrival has its share of songs that allow Diggy to simply flow over pretty good beats. “Tom Edison” has an up-tempo rhythm that incorporates rock music, such as electric guitar and drums.
Here, Diggy drops lines specifically intended for his critics, telling them “All you do is talk a good game like Bob Costas.” Similarly, he puts his wordplay abilities on display with lines like “On a scale of one through 10, I come after nine / You half of mine, so that makes you a Jackson Five.”
Diggy’s background is a prominent theme throughout the album, but he specifically focuses on this during the song “Unforgivable Blackness.”
Though the beat has a very cheesy “everyone come together” feel to it, Diggy raps about unity, about all black people being equally black, whether you come from an inner-city neighborhood or a wealthy family.
The first lines of the track are quite possibly its strongest lyrics as Diggy raps, “They wanna take away my black card ’cause I got a black card / Say I don’t rap hard ’cause I don’t act hard / But if I act hard, they would say that’s odd / And they would still hate, man, I don’t get that part.” Here, Diggy’s thorough and logical rap exemplifies just how intelligent and well-spoken he already is, despite his young age.
For such a young rapper to put out an album like Unexpected Arrival, Diggy should be more than satisfied with his work. Though the album seems to cater to a younger demographic at times, Diggy proves that age is nothing but a number for him when it comes to being able to put together a solid rap album. At only 17 years old, there is no doubt that Diggy will continue to improve in every musical aspect.
Though his arrival might not have been as unexpected as his peers, he has arrived, nonetheless.

Sometimes one can’t help but feel that audiences have grown complacent about what they’ll accept from Hollywood action films.
Action-packed · Rama, portrayed by Iko Uwais (left), packs a punch in Gareth Evans’ The Raid: Redemption. The film shines as an example of martial arts wizardry with its fresh take on action and brilliant choreography. - Photo courtesy of Sony Pictures Classics
With a glut of uninspired, creatively unenthusiastic, gutless assembly line products hitting theaters, it’s difficult to get excited about the latest addition to the genre.
The Raid: Redemption is the antidote to such feelings: It doesn’t fall victim to recent trends in blockbuster filmmaking — it kicks them in the skull.
The story is as simple as they come. Iko Uwais plays Rama, a newcomer to the Indonesian equivalent of a SWAT team that’s been tasked with removing criminal powerhouse Tama (Ray Sahetaphy) from the 15-story apartment complex he’s made his stronghold.
To put it mildly, things don’t go smoothly, resulting in a single-location action movie that, strictly on the basis of kinetic excitement controlled in one building, deserves to be mentioned in the same breath as Die Hard.
The film is stripped down to the base elements and it all works seamlessly.
The opening scenes give viewers all of the context they need, quickly and effectively ramping up to the titular assault that encompasses the rest of the film. The pacing is perfect, with not a second wasted, every scene and set piece evolving into the next to create a thrilling hundred minutes of entertainment.
This movie truly wins itself a place in the annals of martial arts cinema. Using the Indonesian fighting style, Pencak Silat, the combatants move hypnotically yet brutally, displaying each outburst of crushing violence in all its captivating glory. Movements flow seamlessly, and every scene is edited so that the audience can easily follow the chaotic sequence of events without ever losing track of the combatants’ positions in relation to each other or the environment that they transform into their arena.
As easy as it is to get involved in the action, some might be tempted to turn away when they see how unabashed the film is in its ferocity. The Raid: Redemption isn’t the most graphic movie out there, but when so many PG-13 films neglect to show any bullet wounds, it comes as a bit of a wake-up call when the blood really starts flowing.
More notable than just the visual gore, however, is the way every punch, kick, gunshot and cut is intended to have the maximum impact not only on the characters but on audiences.
Each perfectly choreographed fight builds to a deeply satisfying, cheer-inducing climax that leaves viewers wondering how the next battle can possibly live up to the constantly rising bar.
The actors are so good at providing physical thrills that the viewer could easily forgive them if they weren’t talented outside of the more frenetic moments. Even then, they prove themselves perfectly satisfactory.
Uwais is hugely likable as Rama and is fortunate enough to look like an inherently good person — some people just have the face of a protagonist, and he’s one of them. The villains facing off against Rama also provide commendable performances. Yayan Ruhian impresses as the unassuming “Mad Dog,” the main physical adversary in the film whose jaw-dropping martial-arts prowess raises the stakes considerably.
Tama’s other enforcer, Andi (Doni Alamsyah), is perhaps the only character who really looks like an actor, but he handles some of the more dramatic material thrown his way, giving weight to a narrative that does exactly what it should: add depth without slowing things down for a moment.
Even with the achievements of the other actors, the centerpiece is Uwais. His only previous credit is Merantau, another martial-arts film from Raid director Gareth Evans. These two seem to have found a formula that, if properly harnessed, could result in superstar status for both of them.
Sure enough, “Redemption” was recently added to the film’s title to indicate that the film is the first in a planned trilogy. Even at this early stage, it is readily apparent that, if Evans and the rest of the team can maintain the quality of this first installment, they’ll produce one of the all-time great action sagas.
To anyone who finds that notion enticing, now is the time to get on board.

Last Friday, it was revealed director Juan Carlos Fresnadillo will no longer direct the film adaptation of BioShock, Irrational Games’ Ayn Randian romp through an underwater city fighting tank-like monsters and scary little girls. Gore Verbinski had originally taken the director’s seat but hopped off after a fight over the film’s rating and finances. Fresnadillo seems to have left for the same reasons.
Mentioning video games and movies together usually spells disaster on a level of the inane and cheesy Prince of Persia. BioShock, however, could set a new precedent: its source material is actually intelligent and reflective, not focused on headshots and instant kills.
Storytelling has not always been a focus in video games. But that’s changing. With companies like Bioware and Naughty Dog crafting lovely stories around their games, we now have titles that would make great films, not just action-packed spectacles. Here are a few games that would do justice to storytelling.
Assassin’s Creed
The Assassin’s Creed series is every history nerd’s dream game. Ubisoft’s team has crafted amazing recreations of the Crusade-era Holy Land, Renaissance Italy and 16th century Constantinople. The story intertwines with real events, such as the fall of the Borgias and the Pazzi Conspiracy. On top of that it’s a story of assassins, Templars, and a dash of sci-fi. The action is fun – it’s parkour style running across the rooftops of old cities – but the story and characters make it memorable.
Dragon Age
Not all fantasy is hobbits and princesses. Well, Dragon Age does have a princess, but she’s a ruthless politician who will sell you out at a hint of dissent. Dragon Age, one of Bioware’s best-selling titles, takes fantasy tropes and drowns them in blood. Characters do things for selfish reasons, racial prejudice creates slums and terrible crimes, and mages are considered sins against God. Dragon Age gives the main character the option to be a paladin or a cutthroat, but the rest of the world remains intriguingly gray. A dark fantasy film where characters can be destroyed for their idealism or made great from their cruelty? Sounds like a movie version of the Game of Thrones series, and thus an awesome idea.
Mass Effect 
With the rerelease of Star Wars: The Phantom Menace, sci-fi fans are reminded how spotty the space opera genre has gotten. Mass Effect could be a series to challenge that notion. In the distant future, Commander Shepard gathers a team to take on the Reapers, a race of mechanical beings most people believe are a myth. The story drags characters across the galaxy but the emotional core remains on Shepard and his oddball crew. Mass Effect flouts many sci-fi tropes, such as alien races being totally homogenous in beliefs and attitudes.  Shootouts, moral ambiguity and inquiries into the nature of dark matter are par for the course.
Red Dead Redemption
Besides True Grit and Inglorious Basterds, the only good Western in the last decade has been a video game. Red Dead follows ex-highwayman Colton, a rough and tough rancher blackmailed into hunting down his former gang. Along the way he gets dragged into local rivalries, crazy plots, and a Mexican civil war. It’s a fun story that takes the best of the Clint Eastwood films, a dash of Spaghetti Western, and the satiric wit of the team behind the Grand Theft Auto series.

The Women of Troy nabbed two top-10 wins over the weekend, beating No. 7 Loyola Marymount 10-6 at home Sunday in pouring rain after escaping with a 9-7 road win over No. 4 Arizona State Saturday.
After nine different USC (15-3, 3-1) players scored against the Sun Devils (19-4, 2-2) on Saturday, sophomore two-meter Kaleigh Gilchrist broke out to score a career-high five goals against the Lions (11-8) in the gloomy conditions Sunday.
“[Gilchrist] really stepped up today, and we needed somebody to step up,” said USC coach Jovan Vavic. “She got a couple of early goals and her confidence went up.”
Gilchrist was the only USC player to score in the first half against Loyola Maramount, recording her third goal with 1:15 left in the second period to boost the Women of Troy to a 3-2 lead at halftime.
After that, the rest of the squad found their scoring touch.
The Women of Troy outscored the Lions 6-1 in the third period, recording goals on their first four possessions.
“We’ve been getting a lot of great opportunities in other games where we just haven’t finished,” said freshman driver Monica Vavic. “[The third quarter] was just a reflection of us finally putting the pieces of the puzzle together and finishing our shot opportunities.”
Junior driver Dominique Sardo started the streak with a laser that was assisted by Vavic.
Senior driver Nadia Dan tossed a bar-in score on USC’s next possession, then Gilchrist scored her fourth goal to give the Women of Troy a 6-2 lead.
The Lions then responded with a goal of their own, but Gilchrist answered back by evading a double-team in front of the net and pushing in a left-handed score to make the count 7-3.
Junior driver Chelsea Silvers and sophomore two-meter Colleen O’Donnell also recorded goals in the third quarter, completing the scoring surge and giving USC a 9-3 lead that was too much for the Lions to overcome in the final period.
“We took a little while to get started, so we knew we had to pick it up in the second half,” Gilchrist said. “We were being patient and worked on what we’ve practiced for so long, and it all just came together.”
The offense may have sparked USC in Sunday’s win, but clutch defense won the game for the Women of Troy on Saturday against Arizona State.
Going into the fourth period, the score was tied 7-7.
USC put the clamps on the Sun Devils’ offense, holding them scoreless in the final period while Dan and junior driver Blair Moody scored for the Women of Troy to give them the 9-7 win in the MPSF conference match.
“Our defense was excellent in the fourth quarter,” Coach Vavic said. “We really helped each other in transition and half-court defense. Then Nadia and Blair scored two big goals.”
Sophomore goalkeeper Flora Bolonyai recorded 13 saves, six of which came in the fourth period.
Arizona State attacker Alicia Brightwell, who led the MPSF with 2.84 goals per game before this weekend, was held scoreless by the Women of Troy.
“Flora really stepped up in the goal,” Monica Vavic said. “We knew that going into [the fourth quarter] we would need to have more energy than we had the rest of the game.”
The Women of Troy have two home matches this week, hosting Hartwick at 5 p.m. on Wednesday before playing No. 5 California in an MPSF game at 1 p.m. on Saturday.
