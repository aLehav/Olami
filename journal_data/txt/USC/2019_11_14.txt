In a letter to the USC community, Department of Public Safety Chief John Thomas and Chief Health Officer Sarah Van Orman warned students about the risks of drug use, particularly opioids. Since the start of the semester, at least nine students have died. Three of these deaths have been confirmed as suicides, and some of the others are still under investigation, but University officials suspect some of the deaths could be related to drug and opioid use.
In an interview with the Daily Trojan, DPS Captain Edgar Palmer said the recent student deaths sparked increased concern regarding drug use.
“There have been several recent overdose deaths or what are perceived as overdose deaths,” Palmer said. “We just don’t know [the cause] yet because the coroner’s report has not come back. So this is just an assumption, but in these recent deaths, narcotic abuse is something that has been considered.”
According to Thomas and Van Orman, students should be aware of the risks posed by prescription medications such as oxycodone, Percocet, Vicodin, morphine, fentanyl and heroin. 
“In addition to the direct effects of each substance, drugs shared for recreational use can be tainted or mixed with other substances to increase its effects, sometimes without a user’s knowledge,” the letter read. “This practice is rising and is linked to overdose and deaths.”
In 2016, the American College Health Association released a set of guidelines to help universities prevent and create strategies for treating opioid misuse among students. According to the Drug Policy Alliance, accidental drug overdose is the leading cause of death in the U.S. for individuals under 50, and nearly two-thirds of overdose deaths in 2016 involved prescription medication or illegal opioids.
California has also recently faced issues with recreational drugs such as cocaine being laced with fentanyl, an opioid that has caused thousands of deaths across the nation.
Palmer encouraged people in the community to support one another by identifying students who need help.
“I think that when you’re rooming with another student and that student is having issues, it is certainly my belief that someone is aware, and when someone is anywhere, I think the thing that people tend to do is keep quiet about it and pretend like it’s not there,” Palmer said. “And when something happens, it’s like, ‘Oh yeah, I saw that coming,’ so I think when you see someone in need or there is a problem, I think that — even anonymously — you need to alert someone.”
Students are able to anonymously ask for help from the University or recommend a peer by contacting Trojans Care 4 Trojans, an initiative from the Office of Campus Wellness and Crisis Intervention. 
“If you’re feeling like you might harm yourself, or you’re feeling like you’re having trouble coping, and you are using drugs and alcohol, there are means to get that student help,” Palmer said. “But it is something that we need to be made aware of.”
The letter encouraged students to seek treatment and to speak with their medical providers to discuss options. Thomas and Van Orman also told students about Naloxone, a nasal spray that can reverse the impacts of an accidental overdose that can be found at the on-campus pharmacy.
While Palmer said DPS hasn’t noticed a formal pattern indicating higher rates of drug use, he has witnessed an increase in students calling the department and seeking help.
“What I have seen more of is students that are calling because they need assistance, and we are happy for that in that the person recognizes they need help and they call us,” Palmer said. “We get to the scene, and we are able to connect them with some type of service.”

The fifth floor of the Engemann Student Health Center used to be empty. Now, complete with clean white walls, barren desks and empty cabinets, the USC Psychiatry and Behavioral Health Sciences floor will open its doors to students Monday. The floor, which is not yet fully staffed, will have one full-time psychiatrist, one part-time psychiatrist and four therapists ready to counsel and support students next week.
Steven Siegel, chair of the Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences, believes the floor will help students seeking mental health services.
“[The floor] is here really in recognition that seeking mental health services in the community is really difficult,” Siegel said. “And when you add on top of that how difficult it is to access mental health services to the fact that they’re widely distributed and it’s hard to get into, that doesn’t really fit into access for students.”
Siegel said it is difficult to find access to quality and affordable mental health care and the problem with health systems is nation-wide. He said that though USC is unable to control challenges that all universities and health care institutions face, establishing a special clinic on campus can help meet some of these needs.
“This was shell space — there was nothing here,” Siegel said. “The department worked with Keck Medicine at USC to come up with a plan for what would the idea look like.”
Nearly two years ago, Keck Medicine of USC approached the school with the idea of expanding facilities for students, faculty and staff. Over the past year, USC funded the construction of the fifth floor, which includes 18 counseling rooms, a group therapy room, nurses stations and a waiting room with a fireplace and a living wall of moss and plants. 
This past semester, Siegel said Student Health has noticed an increased amount of students seeking support and counseling from the health center. In the last three months, at least nine students have died, and Siegel said the entire community has been impacted by this grief and loss.
“This is a pretty stressful time at USC, and that stress and that grief has an impact on people,” Siegel said. “We have had a dramatic increase in the number of people coming in for care and … it is difficult [because] you are trying to be here in the mothership and at home base … but we also need to be out in the community.”
While there have been calls from University officials and deans encouraging students to seek resources during these difficult times, the plan to expand mental health services on campus has been ongoing.
“A few years ago we started having this conversation … saying we want to do more for students,” Siegel said. “Over a year ago, space was dedicated and resources were allocated. And while this may seem like something that is just appearing at this time, almost randomly, this has been multiple meetings every week for well over a year. [We planned] who to hire, how to staff it, what the design should be and how many rooms there should be — all of it.”
The floor comprises three modules, or pods, each with their own rooms and stations. The floor will open up the first pod and begin seeing students Monday. Though the floor will begin with a soft rollout of staffing, Siegel said the department hopes to take its time to ensure quality care for students, while also helping new staff get acquainted with equipment and technology.
“We are actively recruiting and interviewing people with a plan to staff out the rest of this to be fully functional by the beginning of next year,” Siegel said. “And by August 2020, we hope to have the full place up and running.” 
Currently, a concern among students is the lack of long-term therapy options on campus. While students may be able to seek counseling for a few weeks or months, long-term plans are not as widely available.
Siegel said that while one goal is to provide students with the long-term therapy that may have been lacking, the practice will also have to balance providing care to as many students as possible while maintaining the quality of that care.
“We have two goals: access and quality,” Siegel said. “And we’re cognizant that you have to be mindful of both. Yes, we are offering full-time therapy here, but also we believe in the idea that some people need long-term therapy and some people will be better served by a very focused plan of care … dictated by their needs.”
Additionally, students have been concerned about the wait times for booking an appointment at the health center. Robert Bacon, a junior majoring in health promotion and disease prevention, said while the health center provides great counselors for students to speak to, they can improve in other areas.
“They do a really good job when you actually get a session of being helpful, in my own experiences, of letting you know that they can talk about these issues over a longer span of time,” Bacon said. “But it is so difficult to get an appointment and they do kind of a bad job of not giving you other alternatives when you are still going through your issues.”
Bacon said while he was able to call his mom to discuss some ongoing challenges, not all students are fortunate in that sense.
“But not everybody has that so it is kind of unfair,” Bacon said.
Siegel said that while the model is not perfect, it will mature over the next six months. Students seeking support from the fifth floor will be referred from USC Student Health during the first few months of the floor’s opening.
“We’re committed to intakes, we are going to see patients, and among those students, many will still need to be referred to the community,” Siegel said. “And we will be referring a subset [to the fifth] floor — as many as we can. After the first six months, we anticipate that as we flesh out how this is working and what could work better and how are we triaging … We do expect there will be other paths in.”
USC Student Health fears students are unaware of the services the University provides. Siegel hopes students know they are able to visit the health center if they are in crisis or in need of immediate counseling.
“If you are in crisis, if you feel like you need help now — you will walk in and we will see you in person, right there, right now, today … It is not a new thing,” Siegel said. “And my fear is that people who are hearing that there is a three-week wait time, that is a three-week wait time for a routine intake for someone who would like to start counseling … but if you need care right now, walk into the third floor and we will see you today.”
Amber McKernan, a junior majoring in cognitive science, said she appreciates the health center’s ability to accommodate walk-in appointments. 
“One time, I went in for an emergency counseling session, because they have those now, where you can walk in, and I think that part is great,” McKernan said. “The only issue was that I had to fill out a bunch of paperwork before I got the counseling session, so that was a little bit frustrating. Because I feel like if I walked in and needed emergency counseling, then I should receive it right there without having to go through the paperwork process.”
However, McKernan said she admires Student Health’s work toward providing students with more accessible and higher quality care. She has visited the health center for appointments and commends the University’s commitment to creating support groups for students. These therapy groups range in all topics from sexual identity to parental divorce to gender spectrum-related topics to relationships.
“I am currently in one of those support groups, and I absolutely love it,” McKernan said. “I have two people who mediate it, and they are wonderful therapists that both work at Engemann, so that is something I am very happy that they are doing because I think it’s good to know that other students are facing the same kinds of difficulties.”
Ultimately, Siegel believes the floor is a great first step toward alleviating any concern with USC’s mental health resources. 
“It is just going to be a very small fraction of the need to start,” Siegel said. “That is not to say that it isn’t going to grow rapidly. But I do want you to understand that the first six months, we are going to be absorbing 10% of the referrals, and that is just a function of wanting to do this right.”

Kane Acosta, a junior majoring in music industry, has been crafting and recording his own music since he was 8 years old. 
Acosta discovered his stage name, Ashes to Amber, when he started writing a plethora of songs during a rough time in his life that symbolized his growth and transformation as an artist. 
“I wrote like a bunch of songs, just coming out through a period of my life where it was somewhat dark,” Acosta said. “And eventually through time, I wrote all this music, and I released everything that had happened, showing transition coming from ashes to amber, which is a reminisce of warm light it’s like the transformation of going from nothing to something.” 
The songwriter draws inspiration for his songs from the emotions he feels on a daily basis. His debut EP “Voodoo Blu,” which dropped in October 2018, gained popularity because of the song IRIS. This relatable love song speaks on the concept of love and that first moment when one person looks into the eyes of another and remembers that moment.  
“I usually don’t write music clear to a specific person,” Acosta said. “I probably write it toward a feeling because, for example, off of the ‘Voodoo Blu’ album, that was pretty much written off a weird feeling that would come out of somebody controlling a voodoo blue doll.” 
Before becoming Ashes to Amber, Acosta was an EDM artist in high school under the stage name Steedy Royce. After two years, Acosta realized EDM was not his style and that he wanted to create music with more meaning while connecting it to the emotions he feels.
“I wanted to play live instrumentation because that’s how I started, so immediately something I realized my sophomore year here [at USC], I just randomly found this other kid in music, his name is TJ [Wee], he’s a production major, and we just met up and just started making music,” Acosta said.
Wee, a junior majoring in music production, met Acosta briefly at the start of their freshman year and connected with him again a year and a half later through a mutual friend. Wee, who is currently Acosta’s producer, has been working musically with Acosta since last year.
“I think it’s just fun working with Kane just because he’s down for anything,” Wee said. “He’s very unapologetically him. He’s not classically trained or anything and he just kind of goes off his intuition and feel, and I think just the more we do it together, the more practice he’s getting … It’s just really fun to see the progression of our music through our releases and what we’re making.”
Wee said he sees the passion and emotion in the music Acosta creates and only hopes to continue working with him and releasing more music.
“We’ll probably end up working together for a long time, like for awhile just because we’re best friends,” Wee said. “We see each other every day, and I don’t see myself not working with him in the near future.” 
Lewis Caldwell, who works on the creative design of Acosta’s music, has known Acosta for more than a year and said he immediately took a liking to his friend’s music.
“Kane is a very unique person,” said Caldwell, a junior majoring in business administration. “He’s amazing, he’s like the most charismatic person I’ve ever met. He has so much energy, and I think that it’s so clear in his music. He absolutely just makes whatever he wants and releases it, and you can tell at the core of everything he’s doing, he’s just trying to fun and is succeeding at it.”
Caldwell said he will continue supporting Acosta in his endeavors and is greatly interested in seeing what else he will accomplish and what his future music will sound like.
“As far as I know, he has some music coming and he’s very excited about it and from what I’ve heard, in my opinion it’s better than what’s been released in the past, so I’m excited for that,” Caldwell said. “I think he definitely has potential to scale a lot.”
Acosta hopes to continue his career in this industry and making music that expresses relatable emotions. He eventually hopes to turn Ashes to Amber into a record label or a company that represents the opposite of what the major labels do today. He hopes to have a label that helps artists build their careers without having to be bound to a contract for years.

Toward the end of “Marriage Story,” Charlie (Adam Driver) sits on his couch talking to a social worker who has come to observe his relationship with his son as a result of messy divorce proceedings. In the midst of conversation, while demonstrating a trick he occasionally does for his son involving a box knife, he accidentally cuts himself. Despite the profuse bleeding, he attempts not to acknowledge it, feigning normality despite a wound everyone can see. 
This is what “Marriage Story” is ultimately about: the ways people hurt and how we attempt to move on with our lives.
The film tells the story of Charlie, his wife Nicole (Scarlett Johansson), their son Henry (Azhy Robertson) and the divorce driving their family apart. Charlie is a successful New York theater director, and Nicole was his muse for years, but she has now decided to move to L.A. to pursue a career on the big screen. Divorce papers are served, lawyers are hired and they’re off to the races.
The strength of this film, as with all of Noah Baumbach’s work (most recently 2017’s fantastic “The Meyerowitz Stories: New and Selected”), is in the writing. The dialogue is somehow simultaneously clever and naturalistic, combining moments that are too witty to be true with moments that are too true to be witty. 
He also plays a lot with perspective — early portions of the film are told almost entirely from Nicole’s perspective before switching to Charlie’s. Baumbach subtly uses each protagonist as an unreliable narrator, procuring empathy by showing us Charlie through Nicole’s eyes and vice versa. It’s an incredible little trick that I haven’t seen been used this well since “Certified Copy.”
The switching between perspectives would not be possible without a plethora of strong performances though. Driver in particular is a stand out and will definitely be a contender for Best Actor this year. He plays a man who is pretentious yet kind, aloof yet caring. He uses his strange brand of charisma to fantastic effect. Johansson is quite good as well, and there’s an amazingly funny side character played by Laura Dern. Robertson, who plays the couple’s young son, is also remarkably good, especially for his age.
“Marriage Story” is one of those films one can truly resonate with. One can feel Charlie’s pain as he struggles to prove he’s the father he believes he is, but also Nicole’s pain as she attempts to define herself by something other than her marriage to Charlie. 
It’s incredibly empathetic and understanding, turning words into knives and conversations into elaborate dances. Yet, its greatest achievement isn’t having the viewer understand why Charlie and Nicole were in love — rather, it’s understanding why they aren’t anymore.

Attendees at Tropicália last Sunday got to start their festival with one of the grooviest bands on the lineup: Skegss.
Hailing from Australia, the band brought their neatest and newest tracks to the big stage. Their tracks perfectly embody the sunny vibes of L.A. 
Their retro tracks are perfect for a road trip to the beach and sound like the soundtrack to a coming-of-age movie from the early 1990s. On one of their best tracks “L.S.D,” the band sings that even though it doesn’t know “What I’m doing’s wrong or if it’s right,” “I’m just gonna enjoy the sunshine.” Does it get more L.A. than that?
Last month, the group also dropped the meta music video for their track “Save It For The Weekend” — a perfect follow up to their dynamic 2018 album “My Own Mess.”
I caught up with the laid back rock ‘n’ roll band’s lead singer Ben Reed to talk about their music — and his answers make it clear that they want you to decide whether or not to stan the group.
You guys just got signed to Loma Vista in August — congratulations! What’s that been like so far?
Thanks. Yeah it’s been easy. They are keen to support us in whatever we want to do.
For someone just getting to know Skegss, how would you describe Skegss’ sound?
It’s rock ‘n’ roll I guess, lots of music from the ’60s and ’70s and anything up until now that probably are also influenced by that style.
Talk to me about your newest single “Save it For the Weekend” — the music video is frickin’ dope. What was that like?
It was kind of funny. We tried to make this cowboy video but it turned out terrible. We were horrible cowboys, so we kind of flipped it on its head and watched ourselves on the TV looking like dickheads.
If someone logs onto Spotify to check your music for the first time, what tracks should they listen to first and why?
Shuffle. They can figure it out if they like us.
How was performing at Tropicália? What do y’all like most about Southern California and why?
It was actually epic, the crowds were so fun for an early set. Watched a guy eating a burrito while having a good dance, was epic seeing a few of the Latin bands. They were really sick!
On one of your videos, someone commented: “I just want to be friends with them, they seem so chill.” I watched some of your interviews too and you guys seem like y’all are always just having fun and do seem super chill. How would you describe the group’s dynamic?
Well, we are all pretty different in a few ways. I think that’s why we all bring something to the table. But hanging out-wise, we like the same things like drinking beer, hangin out and eating yummy food, listening to tunes. I think most people enjoy those things.
Some of the lyrics in your tracks are relatable and talk of some tough, personal experiences. On “Up in the Clouds,” you sing: “I might live my whole life not knowing how I’ve survived up until now. And it’s all been worth it, it’s just hard sometimes in the heat of the moment. I can’t see through these eyes at times how the picture really sits.” Talk me through the lyrics.
I’m not sure, you know if it’s relatable to you. I’ll let you decide. 
I love y’all’s merch — who designed it and what’s the concept behind the merch’s designs?
Jack Irvine. He has done all our art since pretty much the start. We give him the songs and he tries to turn them into drawings, make them comical from his perspective. Thanks though. Stoked you like it; he would be too! I’ll let him know.
Lastly, this column is called “You Should Stan.” Why should people stan Skegss?
That’s something they can decide. But we are just doing what we are doing and if anyone wants to listen to our tunes or come to a show then cheers! 
Tomás Mier is a senior writing about up-and-coming artists. He is also the editor-in-chief of the Daily Trojan. His column “You Should Stan” runs every other Friday.

Two years ago, during one of my USC club lacrosse games, a timeout was called. At the end of the two-minute break, we did one of the several USC cheers we had in our rotation. I don’t remember which cheer it was, but I remember that, right after, a bunch of us went “Wooo!” as girls frequently do. 
One of my teammates then said something to the effect of “Oh please don’t do the ‘woo.’ Would the guys ever do that?” A few other girls agreed, and we stopped “doing the woo” in huddles. 
They weren’t wrong. Guys would probably not yell “Wooo!” before leaving a huddle. They’d probably grunt or yell in a deep voice instead. 
This was two years ago, so I’m definitely paraphrasing, but my teammate was making the point that a men’s team would never throw in the “Wooo!” before taking the field. And, to be taken seriously and be truly athletic, our women’s team needed to embody a men’s team. 
Something similar happened on the first day of my internship at a bank the following summer. Standing in a group of new acquaintances, another intern began to talk about the clothes she had bought for the summer — mostly blue and black pantsuits. 
“I’ve heard from so many people that since it’s a man’s world, you have to dress like as much of a man as possible in order to be taken seriously,” she said, referring to the finance world. 
Both of these seemingly insignificant comments have stayed in the back of my mind these past couple of years. I always knew they bothered me, but I never knew how to articulate what it was that I thought was wrong — until I recently read about a certain study. 
There’s a common misconception that women in the workplace are less confident in their abilities than men. The solution to this misconception is typically for women to release their femininity and take on more traditionally “masculine” traits. 
But this study showed that the so-called “confidence gap” between men and women doesn’t actually exist. Women self-report to be just as confident as men do. The difference is that men’s more traditionally “masculine” characteristics display this confidence more explicitly. 
“The problem isn’t with women not feeling strong in their abilities, it’s that it doesn’t always translate in the ways that men understand,” a post by the Instagram account @girlboss said regarding the study. “Just because speaking up during a meeting or asserting your expertise without being asked are standard signifiers of ‘being confident’ doesn’t mean that you lack confidence if you don’t do these things.” 
The takeaway, which is something I’ve always believed and this study confirms, is that you do not have to be or act masculine to be confident, powerful or capable — be it at the workplace or on a sports field. 
Powerful women can be warm, cheerful people. These traditionally “feminine” qualities should not be suppressed. Femininity does not equal a lack of confidence or preparedness. Great athletes can be women who wear a bow in their ponytail and let out a “Wooo!” before taking the field. 
This message applies to men, too. Men should not have to forgo their femininity or exaggerate their masculinity to be viewed as confident.
Conversely, if women want to act more “masculine” than “feminine,” that is completely fine. Both genders should be able to act however they choose. If a woman wants to take the field stoically, she should. If a woman wants to wear pantsuits to work, she should. 
But she should do these things only if she wants to and feels best that way, not because she hopes that forgoing her femininity will make others take her more seriously. We should stop perpetuating the idea that masculinity is superior to femininity and that acting masculine is the only way to be tough and powerful. 
I certainly do not blame my teammate for suggesting that we should slightly suppress our femininity. That’s what millions of young girls and women are taught to do all over the country and in plenty of places around the world. It has been ingrained in our society that to be feminine is to be weaker, less intimidating, less confident and less capable than men. Her suggestion was merely a product of living in that environment. 
But once women collectively embrace femininity and believe that it does equate to strength, energy and competence, the rest of the world will take note and start to believe it too. Wear a pink dress to work, have fun and yell “Wooo!” before leaving the huddle. Let the work you do on the field or in the office speak for itself. We shouldn’t have to be like the boys — we should just be us.

In many ways, this article is a letter to our fellow students. College-bound students can seem like zombies wandering aimlessly into universities without questioning why. For many students, getting to college is only the first step in a journey of exploration — joining a club, making new friends or finding one’s passion. These years are supposed to be the beginning of the rest of our lives, yet so many of us have no idea what to expect. 
In his book “Excellent Sheep: The Miseducation of the American Elite and the Way to a Meaningful Life,” Yale professor William Deresiewicz proposes that the modern college student should embark on a pilgrimage through the university, arriving at its shores and seeking educational enlightenment. Deresiewicz described ideas as “instruments of salvation” driven by a need to work things out on one’s own. Education is a method for individuals to discover what truly matters and determine their own sense of success.
The college experience isn’t identical for any student. However, by speaking to professors from various academic disciplines and creating lasting relationships with peers, we increase our chances of finding ourselves in this unique journey. 
Taking risks, posing questions and creating healthy debate is crucial to discovering what is important to you. The best time to take these leaps of faith is in college, where there are relatively low risks for potentially high rewards. 
Finding yourself does not occur instantaneously; it is a tiring process that continues long after our time at this university. For most of us, college is a formal transition to adulthood. Without parental supervision, we are free to make our own choices. We will make bad decisions, learn from them and grow as a result.
Exploration is the most fundamental aspect of college life, and it explains why we all enroll. But in our attempts to answer the question “What is college for?” we have returned again and again to two other topics: making connections and taking risks, both inside and outside of the classroom.
What is the value of creating connections in college? Our unique college experiences are framed by relationships with friends and mentors. By now, many have probably had conversations with roommates that lasted for hours. We may regret these conversations the next morning, realizing that spending the night talking about our aspirations instead of indulging in sleep is not the best idea. In these moments, however, our experiences with friends build foundations of support. We grow and learn from each other, becoming the people we can trust in difficult times, which is an invaluable aspect of the college experience.
Apart from meeting lifelong friends and mentors, college provides the chance to network with professionals through career fairs, guest speakers and connecting with alumni. With over 425,000 alumni worldwide, the unique opportunity to become a part of the Trojan Family allows students to explore global educational and career options. From gaining professional connections to receiving networking advice, students can reap the benefits of the vast Trojan network and get on a path to success.
Another fundamental element of college is getting out of your comfort zone. Many students are scared to take risks because they want to protect their GPA for graduate school or other postgraduate opportunities. They might also feel pressured to stick with their major rather than explore something new. And yet, according to records from the Dornsife College of Letters, Arts and Sciences, students will change their major two to three times during their undergraduate years.
In a university with such a career-oriented culture, perhaps the appropriate risk to take is focusing on life outside of academics. Deresiewicz states that students “need to get a job, but [they] also need to get a life,” referring to the importance of exploring beyond the academic realm of college. Many people think success in the classroom requires getting good grades, yet many cannot comprehend success outside the classroom. 
The biggest benefit of taking a chance outside the classroom is that it makes us happy. Joining clubs that you genuinely enjoy, such as an intramural soccer team or the board games club can positively impact your performance in the classroom. Extracurriculars are not solely for the purpose of moving forward in your academic path; they are also about having time to be selfish and explore activities that yield genuine happiness and personal growth.
It really boils down to finding out how much risk we are comfortable with both inside and outside of the classroom. Going too far out of our comfort zones could lead to more stress and uncertainty, while not pushing ourselves enough could lead to feeling dissatisfied or unfulfilled. The struggle to find a balance between comfort and healthy discomfort is both normal and unique to every person, so we each have to find our own way. 
College is about the journey, not the destination.

The No. 9 overall USC women’s soccer team will host Cal State Fullerton to open up postseason play at home Saturday after a 14-4-1 regular season earned it a No. 2 seed in the NCAA Tournament.
The Trojans finished 7-4 in Pac-12 play to finish third in the conference, losing their regular season finale to UCLA in a battle for second place last week. USC’s four losses have all come in conference play, as it has dropped games to Stanford, Cal, Washington and UCLA — all quality opponents.  
Heading into the weekend, the Trojans will be affected by injuries, as they have throughout the season. Star junior forward Tara McKeown has been out since USC played Oregon State Nov. 3 and will be questionable against CSUF, but senior midfielder Jalen Woodward, who has been out since the end of October, will make her return.  
McKeown’s potential absence may hurt USC offensively. Sophomore forward Penelope Hocking is likely to carry a heavier load to make up for her absence.  
Fullerton, on the other hand, took care of a weaker schedule to finish 14-2-4 on the season, but USC will be the toughest team it has faced all year. The Titans snagged an NCAA Tournament bid thanks to their undefeated conference record and Big West Tournament Championship. 
As major underdogs, the Titans will come in ready to fight and will play with a chip on their shoulder. They have already faced a few elimination games and have had the opportunity to develop their playoff mentality — high stakes the Trojans have not faced this season.
“We need to make sure that we match the intensity of a team that’s already a tournament champion,” USC head coach Keidane McAlpine said. “They actually have the advantage in that regard.”
Fullerton’s offense has been carried by senior forwards Maddie Bennett and Atlanta Primus, who have 12 and 11 goals on the season, respectively.  
“They are a very over-the-top, go-at-you kind of team,” redshirt junior goalie Kaylie Collins said. “They don’t want to really possess around and keep the game slow. They want a high-tempo kind of game, which we also enjoy doing.” 
McAlpine also added that the Trojans have to be more “refined” in what they do to improve their play and that CSUF will present challenges on both sides of the ball. 
“They are very, very good on set pieces, especially corners,” he said. “They do a great job in their defensive organization in terms of their pressing, and they get numbers into the box.”
Collins and her solid backline will look to slow the two offensive standouts and potentially add a ninth shutout to the team’s resume. Fortunately, the defense may at least have a sense for Fullerton’s offensive approach because the Trojans also rely on a dynamic offensive pair in McKeown and Hocking to handle their scoring.  
Regardless of the Titans’ strategy this game, the Trojans will look to overwhelm them with their firepower and elite talent. Both McAlpine and Collins emphasized the importance of USC playing the way they want to play.
“We are trying to focus more on ourselves,” Collins said about the team’s mentality heading into the game. “Coming in as the two seed, that gives you kind of a confidence boost I think, because you are playing a team that might have not had as a good season as you or that kind of thing. Honestly it’s just about going in and being able to play our game.”
The 64-team field in the NCAA Tournament is shaping up to be another highly competitive and intense postseason. The Pac-12 will receive strong representation as usual, with eight teams qualifying for the postseason. Four of those teams received a top-four seed in their bracket. No. 2 Stanford, which is coming off yet another Pac-12 Championship, earned a one seed while USC and UCLA both received No. 2 spots.
USC will be in the same quadrant as the ACC champion and No. 2 overall team in the nation, North Carolina, as well as No. 13 Oklahoma State and No. 15 Texas Tech.  
In recent years, USC has seen success and plenty of heartbreak in the postseason. In 2016, the Trojans were able to win the national championship, but 2017 and 2018 have featured two tragic losses decided by penalty kicks. 
This Saturday marks the beginning of USC’s hunt for its third national championship. If the Trojans want to avoid a third straight year of heartbreak, the team must come together to defeat a stacked tournament field starting Saturday.

In its penultimate game of the season, the 6-4 USC football team will head north to face the 5-4 Cal Bears. 
While the Trojans don’t completely control their own destiny, they still have a chance to set up an intriguing postseason. Now bowl eligible thanks to last week’s victory, USC still has a slim chance to win its division and earn a spot in the Pac-12 Championship Game with two wins and a Utah loss. 
A victory at Berkeley Saturday will be the first step along that road for the Trojans.
USC Offense vs Cal Defense
The Bears’ defense has been middle of the pack, ranked No. 55 in the FBS in total defense. Cal has been unspectacular against both the run and the pass, and the Trojans should have plenty of opportunities to get their offense going in both areas. 
USC freshman quarterback Kedon Slovis has put up big numbers in recent weeks, and he should have plenty of time to do the same against a Cal pass rush that shouldn’t bother him too much. 
Despite Cal’s middling success defending the pass, redshirt senior safety Ashtyn Davis and redshirt junior cornerback Camryn Bynum are both NFL-caliber talents; Slovis would do well to avoid testing them too often. 
Even with the potential absence of redshirt junior wide receiver Tyler Vaughns, Slovis will have no shortage of capable wide receivers. Sophomore Amon-Ra St. Brown is coming off the best game of his career, freshman Drake London has blossomed in recent weeks and senior Michael Pittman Jr. is on the verge of his first 1,000-yard season. Slovis and the USC passing game should once again have the opportunity for a banner day. 
In the run game, the Trojans could get a major boost as veteran running backs junior Stephen Carr and redshirt junior Vavae Malepeai could both return for the first time in over three weeks. 
Freshman running back Kenan Christon showed remarkable flashes in the duo’s absence, and their return should take pressure off the young back and keep him fresh. Utah dominated Cal on the ground more than two weeks ago, gashing the Bears for 231 yards. The Trojans might look to replicate that success with their potential returning weapons.
Cal Offense vs USC Defense
Cal should not provide the Trojan defense with one of its bigger tests of the year. The Bears have been lackluster on the offensive side of the ball, averaging only 308 yards per game. 
Cal’s offense is focused around a run game that is solid but unremarkable. The Bears average a healthy 125.7 rush yards per game, but that comes on an abysmal efficiency of 3.4 yards per carry. The Trojans have been strong against the run in recent weeks. Barring a meltdown, they should be well-prepared for Cal on the ground. 
The Bears fare even worse in the passing game, averaging only 183 yards per game and are potentially missing their starting quarterback, redshirt sophomore Chase Garbers, whose status is questionable. If he’s out, redshirt junior Devon Modster will likely take the reigns for the Cal offense.
Whoever it is, it’ll be hard for him to find success behind one of the country’s worst offensive lines. Cal’s lack of talent at the skill positions will also pose a problem for the Bears against an athletic USC defense — it’s hard to imagine the Cal quarterback finding open receivers in the short time he’ll have to throw.
Prediction: 35-10, USC
Last week, the Trojans seemed to be on the verge of a blowout victory after they ended the first quarter with a 28-7 lead against ASU. The remainder of the game went differently, however, and the Trojans barely hung on for a win in Tempe after scoring only 3 points in the game’s final three quarters. 
On the road again this week, expect the Trojans to finish the job this time. Unlike ASU or Colorado, Cal lacks the playmakers necessary on offense to make things difficult for the Trojans. Though the Bears will fare better on defense, the Trojans will still put up points, as they usually do. The Trojans average 30.5 points per game this season, and the Bears’ offense will find it tough to match that production.

A Cambridge Analytica whistleblower, who helped expose how the consulting firm collected users’ Facebook data to create psychological profiles for clients such as President Trump’s 2016 general election campaign, spoke to more than 50 students in the Geoffrey Cowan Forum Thursday about how social media platforms gather and use personal data.
The Annenberg Center on Communication Leadership and Policy hosted the whistleblower, Brittany Kaiser, who became popular after she was featured in “The Great Hack,” a 2019 Netflix documentary about the Cambridge Analytica scandal.
“One of the biggest issues in the world today is that we all live digital lives based off of the data that we produce every single day on various platforms and devices, and yet we do not have rights to that data,” she said. 
Kaiser said she started working with data to help politicians push their messages in high school and went on to work for political candidates such as Howard Hughes and later former President Barack Obama for both his senatorial and presidential race. Kaiser helped Obama build his social media presence by creating strategies to collect data on voters. 
“We started to use his page in order to collect basic data about people [such as]: do you care about healthcare, do you care about national security, do you care about the environment, and then we would use that data in order to make sure that you got segmented communications,” Kaiser said. 
While working at Cambridge Analytica, Kaiser learned the firm was collecting targeted data on millions of Facebook users to illegally sell to President DonaldTrump’s campaign during the 2016 presidential election, and she knew she had to report what was going on. 
“Any company that wants to collect data from us or even our government can collect data from us,” Kaiser said. “As much as they would like to buy and sell and trade that use it for whatever purposes without our explicit opt-in.”
Mittie Golding, a senior majoring in cinema and media studies, said she learned about Kaiser’s work when she watched “The Great Hack” in a School of Cinematic Arts class this semester. She said Kaiser’s talk gave her a new perspective on data collection and tech companies.
“Growing up in Silicon Valley, I’ve seen a lot of the way[s] that data impacts me, but we always learn about it there as a positive,” Golding said. “It’s really interesting to see its negative impacts and makes me think a lot about how I use social media and what I decide to share. “ 
Golding believes students can benefit from knowing about how big data can be used in a negative manner.  
“Having any sort of required class on learning how to do this would be interesting. I’d also like to learn what data the school collects on me … but I really think that, especially in 2019, this is something that everyone needs to know about.” 
Emily Olmos, a recent alumnus, enjoyed Kaiser’s talk and said more people should be aware of the data that is collected on them.
“I think it impacts everyone,” she said. “Something that she said that I hadn’t really thought of was how children in data [are used], because when I was 10 probably, I was on MySpace. I shouldn’t have been but I was. So like the fact that kids are able to, or have to give away their data is pretty crazy to me.”
