Vice President for Student Affairs Michael L. Jackson sent an e-mail letter to the student body on Tuesday evening, reassuring students that the university has no plans to ban bikes.
The letter is in response to a Facebook group titled “USC Bike Ban Civil Disobedience,” which says it plans to gather students to ride through the campus bike ban tomorrow morning. More than 2,300 people have said they are attending the event.
“I want to assure you that the University has no plans to ban bikes from campus,” Jackson said. “For many years, we have been engaged in a discussion with students, faculty, and staff regarding how we may assure pedestrian safety and accessibility — particularly in light of the increasing use of bicycles, skateboards, carts, and other wheeled transportation in the core of campus.”
The university has also created a “Bikes@USC” Facebook group for dialogue between students, faculty and staff about bikes, according to the letter.
“We hope to continue to a university-wide dialogue on this issue, in which we will consult extensively with students and student leadership,” Jackson said. “So that our campus stays a vibrant, attractive, and safe space for all members of the Trojan Family.”
The full text of the e-mail is as follows:
Dear USC Students:
We are aware that a number of students have discussed holding a peaceful “bike protest” on Wednesday, October 20, in order to demonstrate against a perceived ban on bicycles on our University Park Campus.
I want to assure you that the University has no plans to ban bikes from campus.  For many years, we have been engaged in a discussion with students, faculty, and staff regarding how we may assure pedestrian safety and accessibility–particularly in light of the increasing use of bicycles, skateboards, carts, and other wheeled transportation in the core of campus.
We hope to continue to a university-wide dialogue on this issue, in which we will consult extensively with students and student leadership, so that our campus stays a vibrant, attractive, and safe space for all members of the Trojan Family.  To this end, we have created a “Bikes@USC” Facebook group in order to stay in contact with any students, faculty, and staff who are interested in this topic.  I hope you’ll join the conversation and share your thoughts/ideas in an open and deliberative process.
Sincerely,
Michael L. Jackson

Vice President for Student Affairs


No Bikes@USC group on facebook = fail.
How about a Ban on Motorized Vehicles at USC page though?
http://www.facebook.com/pages/Ban-Motorized-Vehicles-at-USC/156406071064735
Can anyone find this “Bikes@USC” group?  Maybe I don’t know how to use Facebook well enough, but I can’t find the group.

The coverage of women’s sports in the mainstream media is about to get a huge boost, thanks to USC professor of sociology and gender studies Michael Messner.
Katrina MacGregor | Daily Trojan 
In June, Messner co-authored a study for the Center for Feminist Research at USC that revealed how media giants, especially ESPN, were starving women’s sports coverage. As a result, ESPN is launching a brand-new channel, called espnW, that is marketed specifically toward women. The channel will launch online this fall, with the possibility of becoming a television channel in the spring.
“They’ve made the commitment,” former professional tennis star Billie Jean King told The New York Times. “I don’t think there’s ever been this much planning, research and commitment before.”
Messner’s study found that ESPN’s flagship program SportsCenter devoted only 1.4 percent of its coverage to women’s sports last year, as opposed to 2.1 percent in 2004. It also found 96.3 percent of the lead stories on SportsCenter and on KNBC’s, KCBS’ and KABC’s sports news segments came from men’s sports.
Though adding espnW seems like a step in the right direction, Messner isn’t so sure.
“Yes, it’s going to give women’s sports fans a place to go,” he told The New York Times. “But it might ultimately ghettoize women’s sports and kind of take ESPN off the hook in terms of actually covering them on its main broadcast.”
Messner’s argument is met with mixed reaction in the female community. Although espnW will initially start out with a blog, online streaming video content and even a platform for mobile phones, it puts women on a different level, and some women see it as condescending.
“For those of us that have worked really hard to keep up with the boys, that’s kind of tough to hear,” said Julie DiCaro, the author of a Cubs fan blog, A League of Her Own, to The New York Times. “It seems like this is the broadcasting equivalent of making something pink and putting sparkles on it.”
The vice president of espnW, Laura Gentile, said the logo will not have pink in it and will cover mainstream sports as well as women’s sports. According to research done by each separate league, women make up a vast number of professional sports fans: 44 perfect for the NFL fans, 36 percent for the NBA and 45 percent for the MLB.
EspnW will cater to this population as well, and large companies see promise in the network — as Gatorade and Nike are founding sponsors. Gentile hopes that this network can become a staple in young women’s lives.
“The idea is potentially cultivating this fan base of women’s sports fans, where 10 years from now, girls are growing up truly feeling like ESPN is made for them and ESPN is truly their brand,” she told The New York Times.
If that is the case, Messner and USC have something to be proud of.
This is honestly the best case scenario for proponents of women’s sports coverage in the sports media. Calling it anything less than an encouraging gesture is just absurd. After all espn is a business, it’s looking to control market share and make a profit. If there was a significant demand to see 24 hour updates on women’s sports, it would already have been there. Same reason football garners such a large coverage percentage compared to other sports. This new espnW gives a shot for female sport fans, and if there’s demand then more coverage will follow. That’s the best any sports fan can hope for
[…] ESPN’s coverage of sports is dominated by male sports. But a study released this summer, co-authored by a sociologist at USC, has prompted ESPN to start moving…: […]

Maybe Three Dog Night was on to something with its 1969 hit song “One.”
The song presents a contrast to the value that being No. 1, regardless of how it is achieved, is of the utmost importance.
With lines like “One is the loneliest number” and “it’s the saddest experience you’ll ever know,” I can’t say I envy Chip Kelly and the Oregon Ducks when they come to town next week.
Sure, the 41-year-old lyrics were the basis of a song about broken hearts and the emptiness of falling out of love, but even for a team this university has no lost love for, I can’t help but feel a momentary smidge of sympathy. After all, it was not long ago that the Trojans stood atop the national polls, only to be knocked off by a lesser foe.
Not to discount the impressive season Kelly and his Pac-10-leading Ducks are having, but his team sits in the unenviable position of being the top dog at the least opportune time.
These words might be printed 10 days ahead of the Trojans’ clash with the Ducks, and they aren’t likely to stop you from jumping down from the walls of the student section should the unthinkable become a reality.
Nonetheless, as the lingering bye week forces all of us to continue to rest on the comfortable laurels of USC’s most impressive win this season, avoid defining the Trojans’ upcoming, Nike-clad conference foe by the scarlet number it has been forced to wear.
One glance at the numbers will tell you that Eugene, Ore., is a more desirable place to be if you prefer football prowess to a well-rounded education.
But beneath the one-sided stats, the eyebrow-scrunching numbers and the array of mathematical subplots, do not be enamored by the ranking.
Rankings at this point in the season are about as useful as citing Wikipedia in the bibliography of your essay.
No offense to the “reputable sources” that make up the committees that put out the weekly human polls, but in college football — a sport where fickleness and transiency are about as common as an undefeated team getting screwed out of the national championship game — labeling teams with artificial evaluations does nobody a favor.
Unless Oregon loses to UCLA this weekend  — which would mark the first such defeat for the Ducks at Autzen Stadium to an unranked foe since 2007 — it will be the third team in four weeks to hold the top spot when it comes to Los Angeles for a Pac-10 version of the Monster Mash.
If that isn’t enough to convince you stat-craving fanatics that the No. 1 ranking this time of year doesn’t mean much, then maybe a quick trip down memory lane will do the trick.
Going into Halloween weekend last year, No. 1 Florida and No. 2 Texas boasted the top spots in the rankings. Neither team won the national championship.
Texas and Alabama led the 2008 polls at the end of October. But come January, it was the Gators and Sooners who took their unified talents to South Beach for the Orange Bowl.
In 2007, the Buckeyes laid claim to the No. 1 spot at this point in time, but it was the LSU Tigers who ultimately held the crystal ball when the confetti came pouring down in New Orleans.
In fact, since 2002 there has been only one team who stood atop the AP and Coaches Poll at this point in the season (not counting USC’s now-erased 2004 campaign), and went on to win the national championship.
So to the idiot savants of the sports world, the lesson here is that rankings are trivial.
It’s the reason you couldn’t tell me who was No. 1 after the first 13 miles of the 2008 Boston Marathon or who was the last undefeated team in NCAA men’s basketball in 1997.
History is defined by these moments, big and small. Yet the numbers that summarize their significance are jammed into our almanacs, encyclopedias and, sadly, our tainted psyches.
We have come to grips with the fact that the majority of our statistical consumption is defined by this callous collection of data, but unfortunately this is the overwhelming problem.
Rankings tell a story; they speak to the immediate success of a team or individual, but in no way do they give us the whole picture.
In fact, at the end of the day, what do you remember most about a season?
Is it the number of weeks your team topped the standings or who raised the championship trophy that second Monday in January?
What shouldn’t get lost in my attempt to tear down the very fabric of college football is that Oregon, regardless of a numerical identifier, is a powerhouse program with a cavalcade of stars.
Quarterback Darron Thomas’ eye-opening season — 14 passing touchdowns while also leading Oregon to a nation-best 54.3 points per game and 567 yards per game — should be viewed with similar reverence as those of Heisman hopefuls and fellow duel-threat quarterbacks Terrelle Pryor and Denard Robinson. Accompanying Thomas in the Ducks’ backfield is the nation’s fifth-leading rusher in LaMichael James.
Combine those two gut-punching factors with a defense that led the conference in interceptions, sacks and the least amount of points surrendered up until their bye week this weekend, and the impending threat is apparent.
So to those of you looking to make your way to Los Angeles’ grandest athletic cathedral come Halloween Eve, should the Trojans somehow pull off their own Coliseum miracle, by all means jump with pride.
But do so knowing that a victory against the Ducks should be preserved for the sheer fact that it will mark a significant triumph over a high-caliber opponent, and not for how that opponent has been victimized by a system that chooses to aimlessly qualify Oregon with a meaningless badge of merit.

Following a 48-14 trouncing of the California Golden Bears, USC is looking past its bye week and instead at its Oct. 30 matchup against the No. 1-ranked Oregon Ducks.
Speed drill · Junior tailback Marc Tyler, seen here in practice two weeks ago, has been dealing with a slightly bruised tailbone. The USC rushing attack has been limited by injuries, but the time off will help it heal. - Mannat Saini | Daily Trojan 
The bye week practices are designed to “see where the freshman are at” and to allow starters to “take a little bit of a breather,” said USC coach Lane Kiffin.
Without the stress of game preparation, there is more time to allow redshirt junior tailback Marc Tyler’s slightly bruised tailbone to heal, along with more debilitating injuries to freshman tailback Dillon Baxter and senior tailback C.J. Gable. Senior linebacker Malcolm Smith and junior offensive tackle Tyron Smith did not practice Tuesday, and senior tight end Jordan Cameron was limited.
With these injuries, the Trojan rushing attack — which amassed 211 yards against Cal behind Tyler’s seven carries for 79 yards and a touchdown and Gable’s 13 carries for 72 yards — has taken a serious hit, and Tyler said it will require the entire stable of backs to challenge Oregon.
“Hopefully we’ll get [Gable] and Baxter back,” Tyler said. “We’re going to need all of us.”
—
The practices for the week occur during the early morning, allowing the coaches to recruit high school players in the afternoon. Tuesday’s 6 a.m. practice — the first of its kind in recent players’ memories — was kicked off by Bob Marley’s “Three Little Birds.” The reggae interlude was the lone down-tempo period during a morning of what freshman wide receiver Robert Woods called a “fast, quick practice.”
The practice was marked by a multitude of quickly executed offensive series’, brisk transitions from drill to drill, and culminated in a series of wind sprints.
“We’re focused on making sure we’re in good shape for this marathon — to run at a sprinter’s pace,” Kiffin said of the upcoming game.
The adjustment of tempo is designed to acclimate the team, particularly the defense, to the speed of Oregon’s “blur” offense. The Ducks have reeled off averages of 567 yards and 54.3 points per game this season, enough to be first in the nation in both categories.
Oregon takes an average of 15 seconds to run a play from the spot of the ball to the next snap. Even the most polished no-huddle teams typically require 20-25 seconds between spot and snap. This breakneck pace has proven fatal for Oregon’s opponents, especially in the second half — the Ducks have outscored their opponents 128-13 in the second half.
—
But if there has been any time for the Trojan defense to face the Ducks’ blur offense, it seems to be now.
The unit is coming off a performance in which it allowed only 245 yards of total offense to Cal, including a feeble 52 rushing yards, and shut the Bears out for the first half of the game. The unit also picked off two passes from Cal quarterback Kevin Riley.
Redshirt junior linebacker Chris Galippo said there was no significant development in film study before the Cal game, but rather, “we had just executed — as a whole, as a defense, as a unit.”
Furthermore, Galippo said his unit looked good for the test that Oregon will present, and has two weeks to continue to prepare.
“I’m sure we’ll be ready,” he said.

With Halloween looming at the end of October, pumpkins have formally arrived for their month in the spotlight.
Conspicuously resting in giant cardboard bins at your local produce section, pumpkins have transitioned from a delicious vegetable to a brief, smiley prop. This is a shame; there’s a whole meal waiting beneath the surface.
The orange color of a pumpkin tells you it’s overflowing with beta carotene. Pumpkins also have a relatively low caloric cost, and the seeds are a nutrient-rich, infinitely customizable snack.
So this year, don’t carve a pumpkin only to toss it out while you pick up a can of pumpkin purée — it’s time to have your jack-o’-lantern and eat it too.
Pumpkin preparation is fairly simple. If you’re carving the pumpkin for Halloween, scoop out the seeds as you normally would — an ice cream scoop or a large, wide spoon can especially come in handy. Run your hands through the mess of orange sinews to separate the seeds, place them in a strainer and rinse to finish the job.
To cook the pumpkin, begin by cutting it into quarters. Place on a foil-lined baking sheet, and put in a 400-degree oven for about an hour. The inside flesh should look soft and almost crumbly. Remove from the oven and set aside to cool. When cool, scrape the flesh from the shell and place in a blender and purée until smooth. Alternatively, mash the pumpkin with a potato masher. Refrigerate until ready to eat.
Once you have your pumpkin ready, it’s time to decide what to make.
Coffee and Brown Sugar Roasted Pumpkin Seeds
Social norms tell us to expect pumpkin seeds flavored only with a bit of salt and oil, but try these sweet seeds as a good way to stay awake during your next cram session.
You need:
½ Cup of pumpkin seeds
2 tsps. vanilla extract
2 tsps. instant coffee or espresso
4 tsps. brown sugar
1 egg white
Mix 2 teaspoons vanilla, 2 teaspoons coffee powder and 4 teaspoons brown sugar in a small bowl. Set aside.
In a small bowl, lightly beat the egg white. Pour some over the seeds, just so they are coated. You might not use all of the white.
Toss the seeds in the coffee mixture, making sure to coat thoroughly. Place on a baking sheet and put in a 275-degree oven for 20 minutes.
Pumpkin Waffles
Thinking beyond pie, the pumpkin lends itself especially well to waffles, a dish already familiar with pumpkin’s complementary flavors of cinnamon, nutmeg and cloves.
You need:
2 ½ Cups of flour
1/3 Cup brown sugar
2 ¼ tsps. baking powder
1 tsp. baking soda
½ tsp. salt
2 tsps. cinnamon
1 tsp. ground ginger
¼ tsp. ground cloves
4 large eggs
2 Cups buttermilk
1 Cup pumpkin puree
6 Tbs. melted butter
Cooking spray for the waffle       iron
Preheat the waffle iron. Whisk together the dry ingredients (flour through ground cloves) in a bowl. In a separate bowl, combine the wet ingredients. Whisk the dry ingredients into the wet.
Spray the waffle iron and spoon on the batter until it just covers the surface. Cook until the outside seems set — about five minutes.
Serve immediately, or keep warm in an oven heated to 250-degrees.
Enjoy.
Peanut and Pumpkin Curry Soup
Contrary to popular belief, pumpkin goes great in savory recipes. After all, it is just another squash. A Thai-inspired recipe like this accentuates a pumpkin’s natural inclination toward sweet food while still posing as something you can eat as a main dish for dinner.
You need:
4 Tbs. crunchy peanut butter
1 tsps. tomato paste
The juice and zest of one lime
1 Tbs. Thai fish sauce (or alternatively soy sauce)
1 tsp. of sugar
A small handful of fresh cilantro, stems included
2 red chilies, halved and deseeded (keep the seeds for a spicier dish)
4 cloves of garlic
An inch of fresh ginger, peeled
2 tablespoons vegetable oil
2 red onions, cut into thin arcs
2 Cups pumpkin puree
1 tsp. ground coriander
1 tsp. ground cumin
1 16-ounce can of coconut milk
Stir the peanut butter into a bowl filled with a cup of hot water until it dissolves. Add the lime, fish or soy sauce and sugar, and set aside.
Pull the leaves off the cilantro and set aside. Finely chop the stems, along with the chilies, garlic and ginger.
Heat the oil in a large pan and fry the onions for a few minutes, until they begin to turn translucent. Add the pumpkin, cook for a few more minutes. Stir in the chili mixture and the dried spices. Cook for a minute. Add the coconut milk and peanut butter mixture. Simmer for 15-20 minutes, until the soup begins to thicken. Add soy sauce or salt to taste. Garnish with chopped cilantro leaves and serve over cooked rice.
So whether you blend it, bake it or just munch on its seeds, don’t let your pumpkin go to waste in favor of the canned and processed alternative.

Terror! Voodoo! Suspense!
When people think of comic books, those words aren’t usually the first that come to mind. Instead, people tend to picture superheroes. And although superheroes are the dominant topic of American comic books, they are not the only ones.
At the dawn of the 1950s, horror was all the rage.
Darkness · The book features vintage comics from the era. - Photo courtesy of Abrams Comic Arts 
As World War II ended, the ever-growing superhero genre suddenly stagnated. In its place, the market turned toward the horror genre. The horror boom was short-lived, however, as government censorship quickly killed it. The Horror! The Horror!: Comic Books the Government Didn’t Want You to Read! is an attempt to preserve and showcase these lost works.
Selected and edited by Jim Trombetta, The Horror! The Horror! is a hybrid between a comic book collection and a history book. Featuring covers and excerpts from popular horror books from EC Comics (the publisher behind Tales from the Crypt!) and other companies, the book covers a wide range of spooky topics.
Beside the comic excerpts, the book details the rise of censorship in the comic book industry. Fueled by Frederic Wertham’s infamous book The Seduction of the Innocent — a book that denounced the entire comic book medium as promoting delinquency — Congress created The Comics Code Authority in 1954, a censorship program that nearly destroyed comics entirely.
The CCA was an independent organization that quickly put the kibosh on intense violence, supernatural elements, depictions of graphic crime and scary stories — the staples of the horror genre.
In eerie detail, Trombetta lays out the growing argument against comics, showing the movement’s increasing popularity side by side with the evolving storytelling in the horror genre.
What makes The Horror! The Horror! so enjoyable is its ability to transport the reader back to the early ’50s. It doesn’t make the decade feel like a Leave It to Beaver episode but instead gives the reader an impression of the cultural fears,  and lifestyle of the time.
Amid all of the horror in the comic books themselves, Trombetta highlights the anxieties of the people: fears of atomic warfare and communist threats, a desire to keep their children safe in a scary time. It was amid these fears that censorship took hold, and although it sounds quite silly now, the book gives a Bradbury-esque overtone to the real-life movement.
Trombetta chooses his material carefully. Alongside the history of the genre and its censorship, he adds breakdowns of popular horror topics, such as werewolves, skeletons and brainwashing. These in-depth chapters are short but entertaining, adding cultural context to the spooks in the panels.
For instance, the start of the Korean War saw a rise in stories about brainwashing, as the public feared American prisoners of war might come home with implanted thoughts from the North Koreans and Chinese. The Manchurian Candidate wasn’t the first story to use that fear as a plot point.
The comics themselves are a real treat. Although they might seem a little campy and timid compared to the torture-porn genre that many people now consider horror, the stories work as intriguing parables on the Cold War and the 1950s.
The included comics are split between excerpts and covers, but they work as both stories and as pictures. The comic book covers — published here on high quality paper with great color, as opposed to their pulpy original pressings — are detailed, entertaining works of art. Imagine a cross between pop art and a vintage horror movie poster — that’s one of the many covers in the book.
The art is a high point of the book. Before they really took off in the 1960s, numerous famous comic book artists tried their hand at horror stories. The Horror! The Horror! features the visually appealing early works of Alex Toth (the man who designed Space Ghost — back when he was an action hero and not a talk show host) and Steve Ditko (co-creator of Spider-Man and Doctor Strange) among others.
As an added bonus, the book includes a DVD with Confidential File, an early television show from the ’50s focusing on the “evils” of comics. It’s a great supplement to the book, helping to establish the cultural trends of the time. The show’s silly premise, complete with completely serious “experts,” makes it a perfect, unintentional comedy for the topic, much as how Reefer Madness became popular among the drug users it was trying to condemn.
The book is not a complete history of the rise of censorship in the 1950s, and it’s not a horror fan’s dream collection of vintage spooky comics. Still, The Horror! The Horror! is a great achievement in explaining a cultural fear, giving context to the sources and the reactions. For anyone looking for some old fashioned chills or an interesting bit of history, this is the book to get — especially with Halloween right around the corner.

Living in Los Angeles has its perks come Halloween, especially on the city’s outer edges where some of the entertainment industry’s best makeup and special effects artists live amid eerily disconnected suburban sprawl.
Localized haunted attractions have always been a seasonal offering in L.A.’s family-oriented neighborhoods, but the success of specialized theme parks such as Knott’s Scary Farm or Universal Studios’ Halloween Horror Nights has spawned homespun yard haunts, abandoned-lot takeovers and thrilling attractions for those who need more than a ghost and a skeleton to get their spine tingling.
Because of the resurgence of zombie and gore-centered horror films — such as Saw, 28 Days Later and the Hostel series — the tamer community projects are now living alongside adult-oriented, professional-grade fright fests.
Take Pierce College’s recent embellishment, for instance. Located in the San Fernando Valley, a place with no shortage of empty lots and expansive spaces to convert, the school’s long-running Harvest Festival — which has always featured a pumpkin patch, hay rides and tame, child-appropriate haunts — now conducts an after-dark FrightFair Scream Park, that features three mazes including a scare-filled corn field and a blood-splattered insane asylum.
Though Pierce College and other community attractions choose to build new structures from the ground up, other areas of Los Angeles are using existing buildings to craft elaborate themed haunts. Pasadena’s Old Town Haunt walks visitors through the basement and catacombs of the historical California Union Savings Bank Building, where mysterious occurrences have been reported for more than a century.
The Los Angeles Haunted Hayride is now in its second year, moving its multi-faceted haunts from 600-acre King Gillette Ranch in Calabasas to the former site of the zoo in Griffith Park.
A popular Halloween tradition, the hayride winds visitors through creepy forests and haunted woods before allowing them to walk through a towering maze made of hay and a slightly more docile group of rides known as “Carnival of Souls.”
The Queen Mary, permanently docked in Long Beach, amped up its budget this year, converting the boiler room and parking lot into a demonic five-maze attraction titled Dark Harbor. A definite improvement from the ship’s previous Halloween attempts, Dark Harbor was created by the same team that created last year’s wildly popular Silent Hill Haunt at Sinister Pointe in Brea.
The Sinister Pointe team also assisted the City of Garden Grove in its reclamation of an empty Black Angus restaurant, working with a film prop production company to turn the 10,000 square-foot space into a horror-filled maze called Diner of the Dead.
By reclaiming spaces such as empty parking lots, abandoned buildings and closed-down restaurants, and turning them into seasonal scares full of mazes, gory makeup and Hollywood-worthy special effects, the city is engaging in a quintessentially Los Angeles form of urban renewal.
Instead of building parks, upscale lofts or new outdoor shopping centers as most New Urbanism planners try to do, these unused spaces are being converted into temporary entertainment destinations that only the film industry can create.
With the economy still in a funk and developers more reluctant than ever to invest in permanently converting spaces, the transitory nature of these haunted attractions is a perfect solution for both landowners and haunt designers. For Angelenos hoping to escape the financial stress of their everyday lives, the growing number of oversized Halloween attractions spewing out of formerly abandoned spaces is a welcome, if not an ironic distraction.
In contrast to amusement parks that take on a Halloween theme this time every year — namely Universal Studios, Knott’s Berry Farm and Six Flags Magic Mountain — the local mazes, haunted houses and salvaged buildings give a fright-filled sense of community in pockets of the city that need it most. Indeed, many of the professional pop-up attractions operating this year expanded from yard or community haunts, which gained local popularity, that allow them to expand
Whether done by professionals or amateurs, each neighborhood has its own local Halloween attraction, ensuring that even in a city as large as Los Angeles, a holiday centered around going door-to-door asking neighbors for candy can continue to instill community pride.
With so many options for scaring oneself this Halloween, no one should have to give in to overpriced theme parks. The city is teeming with localized seasonal options for every taste and budget. In the entertainment capital of the world, it is these independent alternatives that will terrorize you the most.

Darius Rucker is well on his way to becoming a country sensation and a household name if his third solo album, Charleston, SC 1966, is anything to go by. The album, which dropped last week, currently sits on top of the iTunes chart.
Birthplace · Taking a cue from Radney Foster’s album Del Rio, TX 1959, Rucker’s new CD takes its title from his place and year of birth. - Photo courtesy of Capitol Records Nashville 
Rucker is primarily known as the front man of the rock band Hootie and the Blowfish, but he has shown wantly his country prowess as well. Rucker signed with Capitol Records Nashville in 2008, several years after embarking on his solo career, and released the highly successful Learn to Live at that time — his ticket to platinum record sales.
Now Rucker has released another solid album with several songs destined for the Billboard charts.
Fans of Rucker from his days in Hootie and the Blowfish will appreciate his transition to country, as his voice fits perfectly with the genre, while still retaining the style from his Hootie days..
Charleston, SC 1966 starts off with “This,” a regret-free song about his good and bad times and everything in between. “This” sets the tone for the album. Rucker is well into his solo career. He is grounded, self-confident and optimistic.
Rucker follows up with “Come Back Song,” which is both his first single off the album and another strong, guitar-driven number. In the song, Rucker asks an old flame to return to him.
Although singing about a lost love has been done too many times before, Rucker manages to make his version of it sound lively and fresh with a mid-tempo, breezy and acoustic opening that builds up during the chorus.
Rucker’s vocals are strong without being too deep and blend smoothly with his brand of tradition-influenced new country. Although he was born and raised in South Carolina, his voice only has a dash of a Southern accent, which adds a  charming touch  to his music.
Another stand out song is “Southern State of Mind” in which Rucker unapologetically references his Southern ways without any of the confrontational animosity that often accompanies songs concerning the same subject.
Instead, the song is dulcet and airy with friendly down-to-earth lyrics that really show Rucker for the Southern gentlemen he truly is, holding doors open for women, and smiling and waving at people in the friendly manner in which he was raised.
Rucker slows the pace of the album a little with the ballad “We All Fall Down,” but he doesn’t digress from his sound. Although the tempo is a bit slower, he still retains the power behind his vocals and the instruments while offering a message of atonement.
Despite the strong vocals, instrumentals and melodies, Charleston, SC 1966 is not a perfect album.
Its main flaw is its deviation into the careless feel-good country music cliché with the song “I Don’t Care,” which is quite suitably titled. The song features seasoned country artist Brad Paisley and utilizes bar-talk to focus primarily on riveting subjects such as which hours are appropriate for drinking beer and not caring if it’s not one of those times.
The song comes in late on the album and serves as a speed bump in the general flow. The song isn’t bad, but it feels a bit obtuse following the contemporary but sincere songs concerning love, the joys of everyday life and Rucker’s comfortable identity as a Southern gentleman.
Charleston, SC 1966 is not a groundbreaking country album, but it is strong, with enjoyable, catchy, well-written and well-executed songs. Rucker’s style is optimistic, and if there’s an album in need of a car CD player, it’s this one.

The air was filled with feverish anticipation on Monday night in the Annenberg Auditorium. Voices buzzed with excited conversation against the sizzling music pumped out by the sound system.
Photo by Nathaniel Gonzalez | Daily Trojan
Everyone awaited the arrival of the night’s speaker, whom associate professor of communication Josh Kun, a co-founder of Annenberg’s Distinguished Lecture Series, would interview.
As Carlos Hernandez, executive director of USC’s Latino Student Assembly, presented an introductory speech, the event’s main contenders entered through the side door. Kun eagerly led the way to the stage, followed by the evening’s focus of attention, genre-defying musician Manu Chao.
Kun began with simple questions for Chao about his background, giving some insight for those uninitiated into his history.
Chao is a world-renowned musician of Galician and Basque heritage (two distinct regions of Spain), despite being born and raised in Paris. His parents often had impassioned South American political refugees over for Sunday dinner, which, along with living in a bilingual home, profoundly affected young Chao’s view of national identity.
He explained that he prefers to pursue an identity that mixes cultures and creates an amalgam of customs and traditions rather than the singularity of just one country.
When asked by Kun to elaborate on what it means to be a “good Spaniard,” Chao rejected the idea of clinging to just one cultural identity and gave a response that would quickly become a trademark of the evening: “I don’t know.”
Chao often claimed to not know something before starting in on a lengthy explanation, where he seemed to slowly discover that he did in fact know and only needed a little more time to find the right words.
For Chao, finding the right words to describe an emotion or circumstance was vital in every response.
“If you have one, two, three sentences and can’t find the fourth, stop,” he said when asked where he finds inspiration for his music. “Don’t force it, let it flow.”
And in Chao’s case, language certainly flows with ease. During the interview with Kun, his answers seamlessly shifted between English and Spanish, with a healthy dose of Italian and French phrases for an extra kick. As Kun also pointed out, Chao once said, “To speak only one language is to not speak another.”
It quickly became evident that language, in its numerous forms, plays a huge part in Chao’s creative process. Throughout the conversation, Chao’s anecdotes and political opinions thrived on the diversity both in his life and in the world. He repeatedly expressed his belief that society’s greatest downfall is its tendency to construct separation, which hinders us from learning about each other and creating a stronger global community.
Live shows, Chao said, are a way for him to inspire the audience to take part in the music and create a larger community of people simply enjoying art. When footage of a recent concert was shown, every member of the on-screen audience was smiling or dancing, looking as if they had just come from a carnival festival.
To shed light on Chao’s progression as a musical innovator, Kun and Chao began to discuss the bands with which he performed. In the mid 1980s, he formed Les Hot Pants, during which the artist took inspiration from  English rock ’n’ roll such as The Clash, along with cultural music icons such as Cuban singer Bola de Nieve.
During these early years, the band mainly sang in English, which Chao explained was because they believed rock ’n’ roll music sounded best when written for the language in which it had been conceived.
One important opinion about the fusion of language and music that Manu upholds to this day is that language should not be used as a means to speak to a specific audience. Instead of viewing language as merely a tool, Manu demonstrated — through an impromptu performance of “Bienvenida a Tijuana” — that it’s the medium through which raw emotion can be conveyed to any audience, even if the exact dictionary definition is lost in translation.
Chao later formed Mano Negra, which became an outlet for his burgeoning desire to experiment with musical genres and a chance to mix diverse styles that had previously been separated. Again, he took the chance to reiterate that separation even exists in music and once the barriers are eliminated, truly inspired art can be created.
Almost every detail that Chao  told in a story or spoke about when prompted by Kun or the audience somehow related to the idea of unity through cultural appreciation and synthesis. Chao advocated an outlook that is aware of other cultures, thereby enhancing individual growth through knowledge and an ability to “find your own autonomy.” After a career filled with passionate dedication and subsequent success, Chao knows he is a lucky man.
“Luck can stand right next you and you can grab it, but if you haven’t worked hard you’ll get burned,” he said.

Campus is abuzz with the news that President Barack Obama will give a speech in Alumni Park on Friday to support Democratic Sen. Barbara Boxer and gubernatorial candidate Jerry Brown, who is also expected to make an appearance, according to the Los Angeles Times.
Alissa Masutani | Daily Trojan
Certainly, it is an exciting prospect. No matter your political inclinations, the opportunity to see a sitting president speak is a rare privilege.
Having Obama on campus will be great publicity for USC and is sure to help USC President C.L. Max Nikias’ ambitious fundraising goals. For the large number of students who support Obama, Friday will be all the more memorable.
However, the fact that Obama has to travel to Los Angeles to make a speech in front of Doheney  Library is a sad reflection on American politics.
The president is busy, to say the least. He is overseeing two wars, working on education reform, managing a record federal deficit and dealing with high unemployment, among other things.
On top of these, there are many important issues for which the president does not even have time to give serious consideration, such as immigration reform. The bottom line is that the president only has so much time to advance his agenda, and it is important for the country that he allocates that time judiciously.
Unfortunately, Obama has been spending the majority of his time lately campaigning for democratic hopefuls and incumbents in an attempt to shore up his party’s tenuous position.
As part of a national tour, the President recently held his biggest rally since the inauguration in Ohio where he boosted democratic support. The speech at USC will be part of a four-day tour of the Western United States.
The White House has made a calculated decision that Obama’s time will be better spent raising money for his allies than running the country from Washington. The sad part is that they might be right.
Experts from across the political spectrum agree that the Republicans stand to be overwhelmingly successful in November’s elections and that this will make passing any legislation much harder for Democrats. The greater the Republican gain, the worse the gridlock will become.
This is an unfortunate fact, because an even split in Washington is a sign of a fairly moderate electorate. Something is wrong with our system when the more moderate the electorate, the harder it is to pass legislation.
Another unfortunate reality behind Obama’s decision is the elevated position of campaign finances.
The main goal that Democrats accomplish by bringing Obama out to speak on a candidate’s behalf is helping that candidate raise money. Sadly, the campaign finance reform that had so much momentum a decade ago — and could subsequently have removed the need for this campaigning — was never passed.
If rules were put in place to limit the amount that candidates can spend on elections as well as regulate donations and Political Action Committees more thoroughly, incumbents would spend less time campaigning and more time actually doing their jobs.
Moreover, campaign finance reform would reduce the influence of special interest groups in Washington by taking away their greatest source of leverage.
Unfortunately, this doesn’t seem likely to occur anytime in the near future.
Ultimately, Obama’s excessive campaigning is a sad reflection on his performance so far. Many Americans are disappointed with his handling of the economy, the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, and healthcare. Obama has not used his political capital wisely, and now his party is paying the price.
This is particularly depressing for those of us who saw the promise of a new direction and better future in Obama. The campaign that was founded on hope and change has transformed into a presidency that has failed to deliver on those same messages.
Obama has not mishandled the economy or even the wars — instead, he was handed a near-impossible situation on numerous fronts the moment he stepped into office.
Anyone who was surprised at his healthcare initiative, for instance, was clearly not paying attention to what he actually said during the campaign.
However, Obama’s failure to communicate with Americans, handle the news media and consistently strike an optimistic tone is both surprising and disappointing given how well he did all of that  during the campaign.
Now, the president is forced to try to make up for it by making guest appearances at other campaigns.
His speech on Friday will probably be reminiscent of his campaign: stirring, hopeful and ultimately uplifting.
Unfortunately, Obama seems not to have mastered those same qualities in communication off the campaign trail — a trail he will continue to be familiar with until he does so.

Obama is a cardboard sham and a dangerous Marxist.
ANOTHER AMNESTY IF SENATOR HARRY REID RETURNS TO WASHINGTON
When does the US government get the right, to extort money from taxpayers to pay for illegal alien children education, health care and a huge number of undisclosed programs thatcater to these people? But if Senator Reid, Barbara Boxer, Nancy Pelosi and all their Democrats followers get returned to the corruption of Washington. Vice President Joe Biden has a similar voting record on illegal immigration to Reid, Boxer, Pelosi, including funding for Sanctuary Cities and no limit to money for illegal aliens. Mark my word the first thing they will do, is to pass the next Amnesty. We might not care to much for the elites in the GOP, but with the involvement of the Tea Party, the majority leaders will not be able to carry on the wishes of their corporate masters as before. With the hidden influences of the shadow government, led by George Soros they are rest assured to stick us with the 13 to 20 illegal immigrants shielded in Sanctuary Cities and States such as California. The Tide Foundation behind the Huffington press, the editorial heavily weighted down with Ultra Liberal George Soros cash.
 The painful result as analyzed by the Heritage foundation is we can add another 2.6 TRILLION dollars, to the US Government deficit of 13  TRILLION. In 2007, it was Senator Harry Reid and Sen.Barney Frank that forced through the legislation forcing banks to lend to high-risk borrowers (Low Income mortgagees) which has destroyed our housing market. U.S. Senate candidate Carly Fiorina will be a major blockade against the infusion of illegal immigration here and will not be passing a Path to Citizenship or AMNESTY.
We need to take a page of Europe and mass deport them, opening the way for jobs for Americans. This will take time using a new powerful revitalized identification program, for business to use and extract illegal labor. All these so called shovel-ready jobs using shady contractors should be forced to use E-Verify. However Senator Reid only allowed E-Verify to pass as a voluntary program. Harry Reid and his minions are a menace to our society, and him as an Incumbent and all the rest should not be allowed anywhere near Washington. He is certainly a tax and spend ultimate liberal, ready to drain your wage packet and purse by allowing illegal workers to join our Social Security benefit program. Interesting enough, FAIR has also diagnosed that annually we the taxpayers dish out another $113 Billion dollars, catering to pregnant women who steal into America, so they can collect benefits, low income housing for the instant citizenship children.
The Liberal press never gives the truth about an assessment of number illegal aliens settled here, or the incredulous costs to hospitals, the education system and a overcrowded prisons. Then again, neither political party will offer a genuine, in the American people’s interest to start self-deportation through Attrition. The state of Arizona has the right idea of the passage of SB1070 and I respect them for protecting their citizens and residents even though must fight  for sanity in the  federal courts.  As a blogger I can only give you an outline of costs to you.  Under the Democratic Senate and house they will keep on forcing you to pay for all these free handouts that the low income Americans are rejected for. Illegal alien women with Anchor Babies can immediately receive section 8 housing when they have three to six children. Read all the outrageous facts of where your taxpayer dollars go in the illegal alien gigantic pool of money.
Well termed “Anchor Babies” illustrates the economic costs to support at least 300.000 of these children of illegal alien females every year. Anchor babies born to illegal aliens instantly qualify as citizens for welfare entitlements and have caused enormous rises in Medicaid costs and stipends under Supplemental Security Income and Disability Income. In Georgia alone gleaned by a true patriotic American Frosty Woodbridge, ” Births of illegal aliens in Georgia cost to taxpayers (Remember, intentional or not, statistics where illegal immigration is almost unobtainable. 2000– 5,133 births cost: $13 million; 2001– 9,528 births cost: $23 million;2002—11,188 births cost: $27 million. Today I have just heard the State of Arizona is taking a stand on this fireball issue, that their county recorder offices are not issuing birth certificates to children of alien parents.
Its imperative you GOOGLE–the keyword “Anchor Babies Costs” and  read Frosty Woodbridges report and come think,all his reports? Read all the official articles and do your deeper investigation for yourselves. Its likely you will have heart palpitations over the dollar figures. In addition read about one illegal family and the money they are collecting from taxpayers. A Frosty says, “In California the cost for all five of their children for one school year exceeds $35,000.00 times 18 years for a grand taxpayer total of $630,000.00. This is only one family. No wonder California is $38 billion in debt.
To interate go to GOOGLE–and establish your own priorities of where taxpayer dollars should be going? Why should you enter this country without permission and immediately have access to other people’s money? On the non-profit website of NumbersUSA are all the answers you need to this spreading problem, including Immigration grades of both the Liberal Democrats and Republicans. If pro-illegal immigrant voters don’t remove Senator Reid, Boxer, Pelosi, Napolitano, Leader and Holder, we are looking at a perilous financial situation, a collapsing infrastructure and worse millions more economic migrants trying to slip into our country. The truth is either party is to blame for this mess, Republicans giving in to the profits of businesses using cheap labor. Then we have the Liberals and Democrats hoping to hold onto their power, by showing not for their love for illegal immigrants, but for future votes.
How is a Obama supposed to address the nation’s problems without the support of Congress, which implies electing representatives and senators willing to work with the president – not those whose major goal seems to be obstructing progress so they can return to the policies that enriched a few and beggared the nation.
The economic disaster was built over years. No one can turn it around in just 2. If jobs is your main concern, the only way to quickly increase jobs is stimulus. Corporations are sitting on large piles of cash because of weak demand. If you reject stimulus, you have to accept a greater downturn and a longer turnaround.
If Obama is such a rank amateur, you have to explain the success of big measures he did push through. Perhaps a novice who knows how to work through people of greater experience, such as Emmanuel, Reid, and Pelosi, is not such an amateur?
During the 1980’s, then presidential candidate Walter Mondale was heckled, showered with epithets and debris and forced to terminate his speaking appearance due to the activities of a small group of 28th street “Gentlemen.” That said, it brought shame upon our University. As a 3rd generation alumnus, I know from my own experience, and that of my forebears, that USC has always striven to be an open forum for thought and speech. I hope that the current student body, faculty and the “New” Administration will behave appropriately. Jean Marie Arouet (AKA: Voltaire) noted, “I will, unto my death, disagree with you. Yet I will, unto my death, defend your right to disagree with me.
“People don’t have jobs. More food stamps than ever. Etc. etc. etc. Obama COULD have turned it around, but it would have required him renouncing his socialist-leaning policies, which will never create a vibrant thriving healthy economy.”
Because Western Europe is doing oh so poorly, and the standard of living is so low there. Get off your high horses and perhaps travel around a bit more. Sure, a plethora of huge corporations are located in America, thriving. But the American economy only benefits the wealthy. Poverty is still high and the income gap distribution is continually widening. Socialism is not a bad thing. Get out of United States and experience what the world has to offer.
“But the American economy only benefits the wealthy. Poverty is still high and the income gap distribution is continually widening. Socialism is not a bad thing.”
I really hope you are a student because you still have a lot to learn.  The American economy only benefits the wealthy??  You’ve got to be kidding.  If/when you graduate, do you plan to work for the government instead of a corporation or yourself?  Where do you think the government gets its money to pay salaries and wages?  Hint: taxes from the evil corporations as well as the people who receive their goods and services from them (that includes you).  Grow up, donate your Che Guevara t-shirt to a homeless person and stop impersonating Pollyanna.
Yeah, it’s all Bush’s fault. Obama just needs more time!
Right. Hey kids in your ivory tower; listen up. America is careening toward bankruptcy.  And while both parties are clearly to blame for the situation — now pay attention, this is the really important part —  it is indisputable that over the last 20 months, Obama’s meddling in the private-sector, rampant out-of-control spending, and sheer ineptitude in realizing the job-killing nature of his policies — this has all pushed the nation closer to the precipice.
People don’t have jobs. More food stamps than ever. Etc. etc. etc. Obama COULD have turned it around, but it would have required him renouncing his socialist-leaning policies, which will never create a vibrant thriving healthy economy.
You gotta give him this: He’s been true to his principles. And as one of the previous comments noted, if you were paying attention during the election you shouldn’t be surprised at what you got. But the conservatives were warning about the dire consequences, and they were sneered at.
The more time he has to act, the more damage that will be done. 
And another bombshell is about to hit the American people too, in the form of some very bad news regarding some very large union employers. The Democrats really put their foot in it with this one. Wait and see.
If you think Mr. Obama is wasting precious time campaigning on behalf of Democratic candidates, wait until next year when he has to campaign for his own re-election.  At any rate, clearly his forte is giving speeches.  Is hot air adding to the global warming problem that he’s not addressing?
Unfortunately, Boxer and Brown will win their respective political positions, though they clearly are not appropriate candidates.  Boxer’s been there too long, hold s a very liberal agenda, as does Brown.  With that said, young people and the politically ignorant will vote them into office, as the Republicans have not provided a clearly experienced alternative.  Whitman and Fiorina may have been successful as CEO’s of their companies, but CEO’s have more power to control their agenda than a Governor or a Senator.  That’s why you don’t find many experienced corporate managers in political office.  With the problems in Sacto, the Gov is a dead place to be in right now.
Daniel Charnoff is a clueless individual. Like Bush did not campaign for others during his term in office. At least Obama doesn’t fall asleep in the evening watching TV instead of being hard at work to improve the country.
I agree that the president’s time is wasted in California. The “D” party in California is not only well funded, but also has a wide margin of voters registered to its party – the next largest voting block has 10% fewer registrants. If Boxer and Brown can’t win here, then they truly deserve to lose.
The Buckley decision (1976) by the US Supreme Court  ruled that money was a First Amendment right. So in the US you cannot prohibit the free spending of tens of millions by groups. You cannot prohibit Meggy Whitman from using $141.5 million (so far) of her “own” money . What the Courts have ruled is- you can put limits on contributions for candidates and political parties but not corporations. That’s why more Republicans get elected but not Meggy- she & Fiorina are flawed candidates.
My young friends, when you have watched the political scene as long as I have you will be able to see more clearly that you elected a rank amateur to the presidency.  This president took a normal, periodic recession and turned it into a serious downturn that is not over, and will not be over for some time.  This president and the academics that he has surrounded himself with have projected an anti-business tone that has succeeded, along with his super-majority in the House and Senate, in paralyzing the business community thus punishing the very people who put him in office with record unemployment along with eroding America’s economic position in the world.  The mantra of hope and change are laughable to those foreign leaders who are playing for keeps.
You claim it was, “a normal, periodic recession”??????
Do you forget that your candidate, McCain, decided to stop campaigning to work on the economy. 
It is and was anything but a normal recession.
“My young friends”. How condescending of you. Based on your nickname, I’m as old as you are. And I’ve been paying attention to the “political scene” probably longer than you have.
But that’s not the point of my post. Where you reveal yourself as entirely irrelevant is your claim that this was a “normal, periodic recession”. The only thing “periodic” about the worst recession since the Great Depression is that like every other major hit on our economy…it was caused by Republican policies and actions. Like clockwork, every time they’ve touched the economy since the 1920’s…America goes over the cliff.
You Cheap Labor Conservatives…always fighting for the rights of American comanies to ship all our jobs over to communist China…are laughable.
Did you copy the talking points for this article from the Fox “News” Propaganda Channel? Obama has performed MIRACLES in less than two years…when compared to the utter destruction left behind by the Republicans. And if he hasn’t solved every problem…we know exactly who was fighting and blocking him at every step. Those same Republicans who’d rather score cheap political points than help America. Meaningless article, mediocrity personified.
What a thoughtless piece. Is Obama responsible for the economic catastrophe he inherited? Is he supposed to turn that around overnight as if he is the CEO of the USA? How is he supposed to advance his agenda when congress is out of session? How can he advance his agenda the next two years if the GOP takes over? 
This is a poorly conceived piece with trite and unoriginal rhetoric.
[…] via Obama rally Friday shows skewed priorities | Daily Trojan. […]
[…] to get a damn thing done," then fine. But Obama's making a stop in Los Angeles to essentially preach to the choir about the importance of keeping certain liberals in key […]

“The next Annie Leibovitz” is just one of the names being donned upon Alex Prager, an up-and-coming photographer whose bright, punchy work is beginning to turn the heads of art lovers everywhere. Marie Claire featured the artist in a short blurb and compared her to Leibovitz because of her defined style and great success — so much so that she was included in the magazine’s list of “Women on Top Awards,” which profiles “the 18 successful women who are changing the world.
It’s hard to not like photos that have strong composition and are filled with a vibrant color palette, and while Prager achieves this, she goes the extra mile in infusing each photograph with a playful hint of a story. Indeed, a spectator might be originally grabbed by the beautifully bright, retro aesthetic of Prager’s photographs but when looking more closely, each photo reveals something darker, funnier, quirkier and sexier.
In her photo spread Polyester, Prager’s shots of stylish ladies (with names like “Lois” and “Rita”), the viewer gets glimpses of “Deborah” sexily smoking a cigarette while leaning on the trunk of a car, the rest of the scene obscured by the backseat, and a shot of “Irene” sitting in a bright yellow taxicab in front of a liquor store as rain and darkness surround her.
However, perhaps the best thing about Prager’s photographs is that although her photos are self-consciously over-the-top retro, they are also peculiarly timeless. “Molly,” for instance, stands in a vintage dress with hair platinum blond and coifed but she also holds a Starbucks coffee in her right hand. Prager’s photos, which at first seem so rooted in early 1960s America, are truly of no time: They have fantastical outbursts of the 21st century, giving them a surreal, secretive attitude.
Whether or not Prager really is the next Leibovitz, her work is starting to receive the attention it deserves.

USC Bike Ban Civil Disobedience was created as a Facebook event last week, and at the time of press approximately 2,300 students have replied that they are attending the event, with more than 750 saying they might attend.
The page said it intends to gather students to ride through Trousdale Parkway at 11:30 a.m. on Wednesday, in the midst of the 10 a.m. to 2 p.m. bike ban that extends through parts of campus.
The creator of the event declined to comment to the Daily Trojan, but said it was a grassroots movement and it expressed a larger desire of USC students to protest the campus bike ban.
The event information says, “Little by little, USC has chipped away at biking on campus. What started off as a ban in front of the bookstore a few short years ago now extends through the main passages of campus. Now they are removing bike racks to discourage people from riding. If we don’t stand up to them now, pretty soon USC will ban bikes altogether. How then are we supposed to roll out of bed ten minutes before class and make it on time?”
Though there has been discussion of changing USC bicycle policies by students and administrators, no policies have been changed. Bikes are only prohibited on campus in certain areas from 10 a.m. to 2 p.m.
Many students have posted on the event’s wall, both those who are in favor of the ban and those who are against it.
The event’s information also urges students not to take the protest too seriously, linking to a YouTube video of Europe’s “The Final Countdown.”

With the football team and an up-and-coming basketball team garnering a large student following at USC, other athletic programs are often left in the dark — not to mention club sports.
But in an effort to change this, the USC men’s club ice hockey team recently announced a partnership with the Anaheim Ducks and THE RINKS development program in an effort to create interest and increase the team’s marketability.
Though USC’s ice hockey team has been affiliated with the Ducks in the past, this new partnership looks to strengthen the bond and hopefully increase the popularity of ice hockey at the university, according to Art Trottier, General Manager of THE RINKS Anaheim and Westminster ICE.
“USC Hockey has already had a long-term affiliation with the Ducks, having called Anaheim ICE home for over 14 years,” Trottier said in a statement on the Ducks’ official website. “This partnership agreement is a natural extension of the strong relationship that already exists between the two organizations.”
The hockey team hopes to take advantage of the Ducks’ several press outlets as a means to build interest in the team. As part of this new agreement, USC Hockey will have a presence on AnaheimDucks.com, Anaheim’s radio and television broadcasts of games, and at select future Ducks home games.
USC also hopes the agreement will increase the team’s marketability, as the team will receive Ducks memorabilia, tickets and promotional items to be used in future USC Hockey auctions and raffles.
USC plays in the Pac-8 Conference. In the conference’s 16-year existence, USC has won eight of the championships, and is the reigning 2010 Champion.

To the dismay — or perhaps just the indifference — of many Hangover fans, it was officially announced that Mel Gibson will make an appearance in the Hangover 2 as a tattoo artist in Bangkok.
The film is scheduled to be released sometime in 2011, and will follow the original gang to Thailand for another round of shenanigans.
There are rumors, however, that Gibson’s arrival has not been well-received by other actors. Some say Zach Galifianakis, who became a hit with his portrayal of eccentric and socially underdeveloped Alan Garner, is protesting Gibson’s involvement with the film.
Because of the casting of Gibson, the film, for better or worse, will conceivably garner more media attention. However, regardless of the controversy, fans of the first Hangover can only hope that the second delivers just as many laughs.

The Compton Community College District recently awarded honorary degrees to 78 second-generation Japanese Americans who were unable to complete their undergraduate studies as a result of their relocation to internment camps during World War II.
A ceremony was held on Saturday as part of the California Nisei College Diploma Project, which seeks to eventually award honorary diplomas to all Japanese Americans, living or deceased, who could not obtain a degree because of their internment.
Many of the honorees, now in their 80s, traveled from across the country in order to receive their diploma. Margaret Yoshida, who was relocated to the Manzanar internment camp in Owens Valley shortly after completing junior high school, flew in from New Jersey to attend the ceremony.
“I really did look forward to graduating in a cap and gown,” Yoshida told the Los Angeles Times. “Now I’m going to be a great-grandma graduate.”
Assemblyman Warren T. Furutani (D-Gardena), a sponsor of the legislation that helped initiate the California Nisei Diploma Project, told the Los Angeles Times that the bill was “an attempt to finish unfinished business, tie together loose ends, and fulfill dreams that were deferred.”

The professional networking site LinkedIn now has a new program that allows college students to explore career options as they enter the job market.
LinkedIn and PricewaterhouseCoopers U.S. collaborated to create Career Explorer, a program that finds job positions within a student’s field of choice, charts a plan to achieve such positions based on the career paths of other LinkedIn users and lets students network with others in that specific field.
PwC is a company that is the largest employer of college graduates and works to help them develop their careers.
“We are dedicated to helping students find the right career path and build successful careers,” said Paula Loop, U.S. and global talent leader for PwC. “In that effort, obviously social media is important and so we actually reached out to LinkedIn and started having this dialogue on how we can work jointly to come to the shared vision of helping students prepare for their future careers.”
PwC is working with 60 schools, including USC, to incorporate the Career Explorer program. Since its release, the Career Explorer function has gotten a fair amount of attention, Loop said.
“Students like it. They can really see what it can show them about their career and career options. I think it’s getting a lot of good buzz,” Loop said.
In addition to connecting students with professionals in their field through LinkedIn’s network, the Career Explorer program helps to develop realistic expectations and goals by giving accurate descriptions and salaries of current jobs and by showing successful career paths of users, she said.
“It gives students an idea of what’s out there and how they should go about it; how they should be thinking about their career,” Loop said.
Although Career Explorer is especially targeted to college students’ needs, the program can be used by people of all ages who are researching potential jobs.
“It’s not specific to those in the business world. It’s for anybody,” Loop said. “From a broader scale, I think it would [be] a benefit to not only people that are considering what their major might be, so what university they might go to, [that has] to have that major and also certainly parents that want to help advise their children.”
Leigh Schneider, a freshman majoring in theatre, said the Career Explorer function seemed like a good tool for students.
“You got to get yourself out there, and as a theatre major, we’re told to go on different websites to network,” Schneider said.
Because LinkedIn memberships are free, Schneider said she thought the Career Explorer program would be an easy way to advance career connections.
However, many other networks are available to students that might be better suited for particular fields, Schneider said. For her major, she has been referred to multiple other sites. As such, the new program might not have a dramatic effect across campus with other networking  opportunities already in play.
“It’s one way to get yourself out there, but it’s not going to replace other ways,” Schneider said.
PwC and LinkedIn are hosting an event on campus today to acquaint students with the new Career Explorer program and to help students with their career development in the Ballroom of the Ronald Tutor Campus Center at 11 a.m..

The USC Catholic Center held the final Mass in its current building on Sunday. Our Savior Parish will be decommissioned to make way for a new church, scheduled to open in fall 2012.

Sunday Mass will be moved to room 101 of the Salvatori Computer Science Building while construction is underway.
Daily Masses will be moved to the Office of Religious Life in the University Religious Center.
The USC Catholic Center will move its operations to a temporary location in University Village.
“Out of the ashes of this old building will rise a beautiful new building on par with the rest of USC,” Father Lawrence Seyer said during the service.
Auxiliary Bishop of Los Angeles Joseph Sartoris presided over the mass. Other clergy members were also in attendance, many of whom are alumni of USC and the parish. The service included a special blessing for members who have received a sacrament — including baptism, first communion, confirmation or marriage — at the parish.
Following the formal Mass, a ceremony was held for the decommissioning of the church. Speakers included Joseph Boskovich, the chairman of the reconstruction, and Kathleen McCarthy, daughter of the founder of the Catholic Center.
“[This] means so much to me and my family,” McCarthy said. “I hope the students will treasure what has been done for them [and will] grow in their faith.”
Following the ceremony, Seyer removed the tabernacle — a cabinet that contains the Eucharist — and locked the doors of the church for the final time. The crucifix was then taken off the building, symbolizing the official closing of the church.
“There are tears because of the significance [of the old church], but also joy because of the building of the new church,” Seyer said.
In hard hats that read “Fight On!,” the organizers of the project broke ground, officially beginning the construction of the new church. After the initial ground was broken, students were also invited to participate in the event.
“I think it’s going to be an awesome facility,” said Rosalie Murphy, a freshman majoring in history. “It’s going to be cool to have a new, more functional space.”
The plans for the new parish were formulated eight years ago, under former USC President Steven B. Sample, who was present at the Mass and was part of the groundbreaking ceremony.
The plans for the new parish, estimated to cost $35 million, were announced in November 2007. The church has raised $33.5 million and hopes to raise the remaining $1.5 million during the 18 months of construction.
The project was initially estimated at $10 million, but the costs rose as plans for the church changed into a more traditional-style Catholic church and added an endowment, according to Clare Faulkner, the executive director of the Catholic Center.
“[The project combined] my love for USC with my love for faith and my belief in kids’ futures as the leaders of this country,” said Rick Caruso, a principal $6-million donor for whom the new center will be named.
“We look forward to building a church where [all] can worship,” Faulkner said.
The cornerstone for the new church was blessed by Pope Benedict XVI in May. The blessing was part of an eight-day trip by Seyer, former USC First Lady Kathryn Sample and other church members to the Vatican.
The new center will include a student union, a library, study areas and two courtyards, Caruso said. The center as a whole is designed to make ministry a more integral part of college life.
Caruso, however, said that he is excited about the chapel more than anything.
“Any great university has a great chapel, and USC is a great university,” Caruso said, “As long as the kids love it, we’ve done a great job.”

USC’s Tri Delta sorority kicked off the first day of its Fat Talk Free Week on Monday, an annual awareness campaign aimed at ending negative comments about female body image.
Tri Delta’s national organization began the movement in 2008, but this is the USC chapter’s first year participating, said Darcy Reinwald, a Tri Delta sophomore majoring in business administration who co-organized the event. Although the national organization’s motto is “End fat talk,” USC’s chapter is also employing the phrase “Healthy is beautiful,” said Kirstyn Shaw, a sophomore majoring in business administration who is also in charge of organizing the event.
“What we’re trying to accomplish is a healthy body image that’s about being fit, eating right and being comfortable with yourself,” Shaw said.
“Fat talk” refers to the kind of casual, everyday statements that reinforce thin as ideal and contribute to women’s dissatisfaction with their bodies, she said.
College campuses are potential hotspots for young women thinking about body image, said Sarah Banet-Weiser, associate professor at USC’s Annenberg School for Communication & Journalism.
“The ideal woman we see [in the media] is around college-aged. By virtue of their age, [college women] are exactly what the media and what cultural discourse are focusing on in terms of ideal femininity,” Banet-Weiser said.
Panhellenic Council President Laura Redfern acknowledged that these issues might be especially pervasive in the Greek community.
“Many girls feel under the spotlight a lot by sorority sisters or boys. If they don’t fit the ideal, they put themselves down,” Redfern said.
Banet-Weiser said raising awareness with events like Fat Talk Free Week is a legitimate way to approach — and ultimately improve — the conversation about body image and social pressures.
“What this sorority has tapped into is a recognition that we need to change the terms and language of discourse,” Banet-Weiser said. “The word ‘fat’ is still used everywhere … as a kind of epithet. … As long as that is happening, we [will] have a categorization system in our culture where thin is the side that is [seen as] most valuable.”
Although USC’s chapter is focusing on targeting Panhellenic members, it is also committed to letting all women on campus participate and recognizes that males can be involved in the conversation as well, Reinwald said.
“Since this was our first year, we wanted to open it up softly and really focus on sorority girls, and then girls across campus,” Reinwald said. “We would definitely be open to having the university a lot more involved in later years.”
Tri Delta will ask girls to take a pledge vowing not to make negative comments regarding body image during the week.
Participating girls will put their handprints on posters that Tri Delta will hang in front of its house on The Row to promote the cause and encourage healthy debate throughout the USC community.
In addition, members of the sorority will be tabling on Trousdale Parkway throughout the week to spread awareness by opening the pledge up to non-Greeks.
“The whole idea is to create an atmosphere across campus that promotes better body image … and ends unrealistic standards for our bodies,” Reinwald said. “If we eliminate it for one week, then hopefully it’ll keep going [from there].”
Redfern said she believes the event will inform individuals about their own criticism of themselves and others as well as inform men about how often women think about body image and weight.
“It’s a great exercise in thinking about stopping yourself before you say those negative things,” she said. “Ideally, people [will] become aware of how often they do talk about it.”
Banet-Weiser encouraged sororities to maintain an active role in promoting the conversation and to continue acknowledging and expanding the role of young men as well.
“This is just one element in a much wider continuum of cultural practices that we will need to address in order to actually change [the problem],” she said. “It is important [not only] that sororities are the ones that start this conversation, but that they are also the ones to continue it.”

The Seaver Plaza Food Court on the Health Sciences Campus opened last week after four months of construction, which had led HSC students and visitors to seek other dining options such as food trucks, students said.
Options galore · Students and visitors at the Health Sciences Campus can now dine at the newly renovated Seaver Plaza, which holds a Starbucks, Panda Express, Poquito Mas and the Marketplace. - Dieuwertje Kast | Daily Trojan 
“Before this opened, there were only food trucks or the hospital cafeteria,” said Calvin Cha, a first-year graduate student studying pharmacy. “I was pretty excited about the renovation when I heard that we were getting Panda [Express].”
In addition to Panda Express, the food court now offers Starbucks, Poquito Mas and the Marketplace, which stocks convenience goods and snacks such as fruit and sandwiches.
According to Kris Klinger, director of USC Hospitality, the decision to add these restaurants was to offer more and better choices for dining.
“In the past there were no branded concepts. There were not a lot of good options. Now we have better options than we had in the past,” Klinger said.
Phil Turner, assistant manager of the Starbucks in Seaver Plaza, said he is impressed with the increased quality that customers can expect from the renovated food court.
“I think the brand standards really promote a more consistent dining experience,” Turner said. “The biggest changes are the updated recipes and product selection.”
For hospital staff, faculty and students who frequent the food court, these healthier options are welcome, they said. Still, students without cars, like Cha, said they feel limited.
“Honestly, it’s one of the only places to eat at this school. There’s nothing within walking distance [of HSC],” Cha said.
HSC plans to celebrate the food court’s opening in the coming weeks.
Compared to the old Seaver Food Court and limited options students had before students said, this Seaver Food court is much improved.
“This is a pretty good place to eat,” said Kei-Cheuk Ng, a graduate student studying pharmacy.

Students and faculty on both USC campuses will practice their “drop, cover and hold on” techniques Thursday during the third annual Great California ShakeOut.
The ShakeOut is a statewide earthquake drill intended to inform the public about what to do and how to prepare in the event of an earthquake.
USC is one of 157 colleges and universities currently registered to participate in the event, which will take place at 10:21 a.m. Thursday.
Steve Goldfarb, a fire safety and emergency planning specialist, said it is extremely important for USC to take part in this drill.
“If people know what to do and how to react in the event of an earthquake, it will prevent injuries,” Goldfarb said.
USC has participated in this event for the last two years, and it has been very successful, he said.
This year, for the first time, USC has recruited more than 200 people to facilitate the drill on campus. Called ShakeOut drill ambassadors, these faculty members have been given the training and instructions to lead the drill in their particular areas of campus.
In addition to the drop-and-cover drill, training exercises will be held by various emergency response teams on campus. These teams will review emergency plans that are already in place and practice setting up Department Operations Centers and command posts. They will also test the communication abilities between the University Park Campus and Health Sciences Campus.
The Department of Public Safety, USC Facilities Management Services, USC Auxiliary Services and others will come together to help with the event.
Statewide, more than 7 million people have signed up for the ShakeOut, which is sponsored by the Earthquake Country Alliance.
Last year, 6.9 million Californians participated, Goldfarb said. With the catastrophic earthquakes in both Haiti and Chile this year, interest has peaked even further.
Goldfarb said he believes recent research indicating that an earthquake along the San Andreas Fault will occur sooner and be larger than previously thought is also increasing public interest.
This report, released in August by researchers at UC Irvine and Arizona State, has had many people talking about the possibility of the “big one.”
In addition, a 2008 study cited by ShakeOut organizers indicates that there is a 99.7 percent chance of a large earthquake occuring in California within the next 30 years.
Though the drill is not mandatory, Goldfarb said he strongly encourages just a few minutes of participation from students and staff in classes, offices and residence halls across campus.
Isha Awasthi, a junior majoring in business administration, said she believes the drill will be helpful for both students and emergency responders.
“I think it’s important just so people have continued awareness,” Awasthi said. “If we don’t do the drill, people might forget.”
Goldfarb said students wishing to learn more about the event can visit the USC Safety and Emergency Preparedness page on Facebook.
