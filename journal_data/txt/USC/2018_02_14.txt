Former California Gov. Gray Davis sat down for a conversation with the USC Jesse M. Unruh Institute of Politics director Bob Shrum at Wallis Annenberg Hall on Tuesday. During his talk, he discussed the upcoming gubernatorial election and the future of the nation’s political climate.

This event marked the third installment in the institute’s semester-long Political Conversation series, which aims to facilitate on-campus discussion with notable politicians, political operatives and policy experts.
The evening began with Davis’ thoughts on the state’s current gubernatorial race. Davis, who served from 1999 to 2003, said he believes the race will be tight.
“The race seems to be pretty close,” Davis said. “It’s going to be a horse race and it’s going to be divided north and south.” 
In his talk, Davis emphasized the importance of empathy politics, in which politicians are more focused on the interests of their constituents. 
“In politics it’s all about helping you, not helping Gray Davis or Donald Trump,” Davis said. “It’s about helping you have a better life. You’ll be happier, you’re family will be happier, you’ll do better, you’ll be more charitable, your business will hire more people”
Though critical of Trump, Davis acknowledged the administration’s progress in reshaping the federal judiciary but voiced optimism when it came to environmental and state politics. 
“The science is strong,” Davis said. “The damage to the climate and the planet is so clear that I think it will be hard for him, serving in a four-year time frame, to win on climate change and I think we have a strong case on offshore drilling.”
Davis predicted that the next U.S. President will be the opposite of Trump: a “humble, respectful, library-type,” who will represent a repudiation of both the character and policies of the current administration.
On the future of the Democratic party, Davis said that every elections race is a referendum. 
Through events like Davis’ talk, Shrum said he hopes that students will understand the diligence and commitment politicians bring to their work and that solving these nationwide issues is a task easier said than done. 
“Most of what I hope out of this whole series is that students will interact with real political actors from the real world,” Shrum said. “I think that will change some of the stereotypes some folks have and maybe even encourage some involvement.”
Carlo Santiago, a freshman majoring in political science, attended Davis’ talk and felt that it changed his outlook on national politics. 
“He made me think that [Democrats] don’t have a candidate to challenge Donald Trump [in 2020], but if there was one that … was inspiring, touches on jobs, appeals to Democratic working class voters, then there’s a chance Democrats could win the White House again,” Santiago said.

The Undergraduate Student Government Senate rejected the bylaw amendment proposal to add a new advocacy director by a vote of 9-3 on Tuesday.
Senator Christine Bradshaw spoke at the USG meeting on Tuesday about current projects that USG is developing. Catherine Liang | Daily Trojan
This was the first proposal rejected by the Senate this academic year. The proposed repurposed Director of External Affairs position under the advocacy branch, was meant to increase political engagement among USC students. Many senators feared that the spirit of the position could be corrupted by partisan allegiances.
Senator Preston Fregia was vehement in his opposition to the new position. When the position was proposed two weeks ago, he referred to an article from The New Yorker, which described the influence of conservative groups on student governments in many top universities. USC was mentioned in the article, connecting the University’s student government with the conservative nonprofit Turning Point USA. A recent Daily Trojan investigation referred to documents that linked USG President Austin Dunn to TPUSA.
“[The New Yorker piece] talked about this idea of people being influenced by outside institutions,” Fregia said. “And to be honest, I thought that maybe it could be someone like a senator, but I didn’t know that it was the head of the institution: Austin Dunn.”
Senator Natalie Antounian spoke in favor of Dunn and Vice President Morgan Monahan at the meeting, saying that their track record in office for supporting progressive policies spoke for itself.
Senator Katie Bolton led the charge in favor of the amendment for the new advocacy director, noting low political involvement among college students as justification for adding this position. Bolton said she consulted directly with Alec Vandenberg, co-director of the Service Student Assembly and architect of the proposal.
“Despite the fact that students make up a huge constituency, politicians have little incentive to faithfully represent our interests because we do bother to not involve ourselves in the process,” Bolton said. “We don’t vote and we don’t advocate for ourselves. Unsurprisingly, our priorities are largely neglected.”
Senator Blake Ackerman also spoke against the proposal. He voiced concerns regarding partisan bias and how it would be an issue regardless of whether it was conscious bias.
“I think that this position would become partisan because at the end of the day, students have their own positions and backgrounds,” Ackerman said. “Our job is not to use our backgrounds or use our positions as leverage.”
Bolton continued to press her point regarding student involvement in politics, describing how the new director could help students exercise their desires to become involved.
“By having an organizer in place that can facilitate that participation and empower students to make their voices heard, the … barrier to entry is decreased,” Bolton said.
Senator Tyler Matheson noted the abundance of questions and reservations regarding the amendment, saying that this was cause for concern. He suggested that the position be moved to programming, but that otherwise it would be unnecessary.
“All of advocacy is about issues,” Matheson said. “They advocate on behalf of students on issues and if we have to particularly say that this position can’t do that, it just makes no sense to do this.”

For Nazeli Khodabakhsh, a second-year student at the USC Gould School of Law, finding opportunities to give back to the community has proved difficult. However, USC Gould has been in the process of developing clinics — one of which is focused on immigration — throughout Los Angeles for students like Khodabakhsh to apply legal knowledge from her classes.
USC Gould School of Law will be hosting the immigration clinic on Feb. 24 in partnership with the Armenian Youth Federation Burbank Varak chapter and the Armenian Cultural Foundation. Photo from the AYF West website.
The Gould Immigration Clinic will be hosting a Citizenship Clinic on Feb. 24 with the Armenian Youth Federation Burbank Varak chapter and the Armenian Cultural Foundation. 
The clinic, which will be held at the ACF Burbank Youth Center, will assist legally permanent residents with their naturalization applications. 
According to Khodabakhsh, a member of the AYF Central Executive, citizenship clinics are just one of the projects the Gould Immigration Clinic facilitates. 
“The idea is to have students have hands-on experience working with real clients,” Khodabakhsh said. “We’re all supervised by our professors and for the immigration clinic, each one of us gets maybe 10 clients that we’re responsible for throughout the year. We help them file for immigration benefits, different kinds of visas, people seeking asylum — we help with all of that.”
While planning the upcoming clinic, Khodabakhsh served as a liaison between the AYF Burbank chapter and the Gould Immigration Clinic. Khodabakhsh added that the partnership between the two organizations allowed them to reach a broader range of people who may be interested in naturalization. 
“We have sort of like a small army to reach out to individuals and ask, ‘Are you a citizen? Are you interested in becoming a citizen? We have this free project that can help you,’” Khodabakhsh said. “We have different contacts within our communities, so USC is maybe 15 miles away from Burbank but it seems like two different worlds — we really focus on the Burbank area and reaching out to people there but USC has its own contacts and its own people who have been interested in these clinics in the past.”
According to Dulce Sanchez, the USC Gould Immigration Clinic’s program manager, the outreach process for clinics begin a month or two in advance. Sanchez was in charge of coordinating citizenship clinics throughout the L.A. area. 
“We put together the flyers, send them to the community centers, to libraries, churches, adult school community colleges, and share it with folks that may be interested in naturalizing,” Sanchez said. “If there are lawful permanent residents in the area interested in naturalizing, they’ll give us a call at the number listed on the flyer.”
Sanchez said that during this process, they also screen the lawfully permanent resident for eligibility to waive an application fee and provide resources for those who cannot afford them. 
“We have had a lot of folks come to a previous clinic who have expressed interest in naturalizing for some time, but for whatever reason didn’t have the financial means to pay the $725 fee so we’ll go ahead and assist them,” Sanchez said.
Sanchez said that the clinic’s other co-sponsor, the ACF, have also helped with outreach, especially throughout the Armenian community. 
“They’re more tapped into that community, whether it be families that come to their center or are in surrounding areas,” Sanchez said. “I’ve been supervising our students so that they can conduct outreach in the areas nearby, such as Glendale [and] North Hollywood, just so that we can expand this service to as many people as possible. 
Khodabakhsh said that she finds immigration law fascinating and hopes to help as many people naturalize as possible due to the rights and civic responsibilities that come with becoming a citizen. For example, once someone becomes a citizen, they are granted voting rights and do not have to undergo the risk of getting deported.
“Once you have a green card, or [become a] lawful permanent resident, that also allows you to stay, but if you commit certain crimes or anything you could be deported,” Khodabakhsh said. “But a lot of people don’t necessarily know that, and so they’re like, ‘I can stay with a green card forever, I have legal status.’”
According to Sanchez, the Gould Immigration Clinic is a resource that is available to all students at USC, especially those who have questions regarding citizenship or are undocumented and are seeking help. Sanchez said that all students can volunteer at the Gould Immigration Clinic and was “in awe” of the work students have been doing, such as helping their community to gain more substantive knowledge on immigration laws.
“[Students] are interested in pursuing a career in immigration law, so this has given them a preview of what a career in that field may look like,” Sanchez said. “It’s been a great opportunity for students and I hope that many more students will consider volunteering at our future clinics.”

The USC Leonard Davis School of Gerontology and the nonprofit Youth Movement Against Alzheimer’s launched YouthCare on Tuesday, in an effort to provide resources to patients with Alzheimer’s and dementia.
According to the press release, this partnership is intended to help those in need and to change the lives of caregivers, students and patients. 
“Our mission statement is to unite generations toward a common cause of fighting dementia and Alzheimer’s’ disease to ultimately not only spread awareness, but also look for care solutions and the burden of caregiving,” said Jay Gopal, the director of caregiving programs at YouthCare.
The program pairs undergraduate and graduate students from USC to work with and provide care to older adults with early-stage dementia. These students will work three-hour shifts once or twice a week, Gopal said.
According to the press release, the time the students spend with the patients will create a better sense of community and foster close relationships. The program has recruited over 20 USC students to serve as caregivers. 
“YouthCare is an accessible way for students to interact one-on-one with older adults to understand the reality to put a face to Alzheimer’s and to work towards a solution,” said Sarah Wong, the president of the USC Student Gerontology Association. “The timely solution right now is to systematically treat the symptoms and that the future in caregiving will help as well.”
YouthCare founder Nihal Satyadev and Gopal, both UCLA alumni, began a similar program at UCLA in 2015 called TimeOut @ UCLA, which also focused on respite care and support for older adults.
Satyadev said that dementia caregivers in the United States face the problem of being unable to work for service providers that offer positions less than 10 hours per week. 
YouthCare offers the option to work three or six hours a week at a low rate per hour, giving a reassuring opportunity for those caregivers who are still seeking employment. 
“For caregivers, it’s really important for them to take a break from their stressful life in taking care of family members who have the disease,” Satyadev said. “Forty percent of caregivers who work with family members with dimensions are diagnosed with depression. We believe that this is a key mental health solution to decrease the rates of depression.”
Being involved with YouthCare allows students to develop a geriatric service skill set by having real-life interactions and relationships with Alzheimer’s patients, Wong said. 
According to the press release, for the first time in history, about 20 percent of Americans will be in the age group over 65 in 2030. The number of patients diagnosed with Alzheimer’s disease is expected to drastically increase from 5.5 million to 11 million in 12 years.

Shauli Bar-On | Daily Trojan
Self-identified white nationalist Richard Spencer was invited to speak at the University of Cincinnati on March 14. No, the school did not deny the controversial speaker the right to speak. They did not refuse to give him a venue, a microphone or a platform. They just asked for him to pay $11,000 for security. Spencer found this unreasonable and filed a federal lawsuit on Monday. 
Let’s first examine why schools like the University of Cincinnati need security for speakers like Spencer in the first place. Sure, the argument could be made that the inflammatory words of such speakers cause students to protest. And it’s true they have the right to protest —  but take a look at the First Amendment one more time: They have the right to peaceably assemble. Just because several students choose to violently exhibit their disapproval with certain speakers does not mean it should be the speaker’s responsibility to maintain the order. The school ought to control its own students — and write its own checks.   
It’s also important to analyze which speakers generate the need for high-cost security. The vast majority of elite colleges in the United States are liberal. The liberal to conservative professor ratio is 12:1, and younger voters tend to vote Democrat more often than Republican. By nature, the liberal voice is also a much stronger voice than its conservative counterpart. Liberal student activism is significantly more apparent on a variety of issues including economic progressivism, abortion rights, labor rights, environmental justice and so forth. The progressive agenda is more concerned with challenging the status quo, while the conservative one tends to favor the way things have always functioned. Therefore, it is natural for those who want to instigate change to have their voice heard more than it is for those eager to maintain the status quo to have theirs heard.
As such, protests against conservative speakers are much more common. They also have occasionally turned violent. In response to speeches from conservative commentators like Ann Coulter, Milo Yiannopoulos and Ben Shapiro, we have seen potentially dangerous protests at a number of schools nationwide including UC Berkeley, the University of Chicago, Claremont McKenna, UC Davis and the University of Washington.

Some argue that no one is responsible for maintaining and defending speakers’ platforms. Hate speech is unprotected. We know this simply isn’t true in a democracy that must allow for even the most extreme of positions to be tested in the marketplace of ideas. 
Others contend that the speaker is responsible, but this is an illogical answer. Protecting the rights of those with ideas that are in the minority is a fundamental right in the United States. Imposing security fees on speakers is a covert way of blocking them from speaking. It is a way of letting the majority — albeit sometimes just a very loud and disorderly group — block the minority from presenting its viewpoints publicly. 
Lastly, others argue the responsibility of providing spheres for free speech falls on  the universities themselves. As institutions of higher education and debate, schools have the obligation to allow speakers of all viewpoints. The responsibility to protect students should fall on them, not their guests. 
While it may make sense to advise controversial speakers to bring bodyguards for their own protection, whose responsibility is it to ensure the safety of the students? Who must protect students from potential violence as a result of what should be peaceful protests? The university, of course.

Reporters Tess Owen and Josh Marcus opined on Vice News on the double-edged sword of white supremacist Richard Spencer last year: “Richard Spencer has put American public universities in a legal quagmire: Allow him to speak, and face exorbitant security costs and the possibility of injuries or death. Or don’t let him come to campus, and risk a lawsuit and the prospect of paying a white supremacist directly in the form of a judgement or legal settlement.”
Well, it looks like the University of Cincinnati has tried a workaround: Let him come, but make him pay for security. The university’s requirement of Spencer to pay nearly $11,000 for security during his planned talk — what Spencer’s attorney Kyle Bristow called a discriminatory and unconstitutional “speech tax” — has now resulted in a federal lawsuit against the university. The university’s president, Neville Pinto, said that the security fee is merely part of standard policy.
“The university has historically charged security fees and costs for the rental of any of its facilities by an outside entity,” Pinto said in a press release. If that’s true, then Spencer’s argument that he was discriminated against is not grounded in facts. The bigger, more interesting question is whether requiring campus speakers to pay for their security at all threatens the values of free speech.
Yet, in the court system, Spencer has powerful First Amendment precedent on his side. The 1992 Supreme Court case Forsyth County, Ga. v. The Nationalist Movement determined that fees for permits for public demonstrations could not depend on the estimated cost of protecting public order — because that would tie the amount of the fee to the content of the speech. But given the hundreds of thousands that other public universities have spent on Spencer and other speakers, an $11,000 fee is more than reasonable — which is key, because the law in Forsyth failed partially because they did not have “narrowly drawn, reasonable and definite standards.”
Of course, Spencer could easily avoid a $11,000 fee; if his rhetoric were less hateful or his message less incendiary, he wouldn’t require so much security. But Spencer isn’t going to do that because he is, as The Atlantic put it, a “troll.” He seems to enjoy pushing the boundaries of what he can and can’t do, and raising up a firestorm in media and the court system when he is challenged.

Those concerned about the spread of white nationalist ideologies — of which Spencer is the modern figurehead — should realize that engaging in this debate is playing into Spencer’s strategy.
If Spencer wins in court, he will speak at the University of Cincinnati — and force any university to pay for his security at other colleges, as well. It would allow him virtually unfettered access to platforms for college students, provided campus groups are willing to invite him. It would hamstring universities to scramble for tens or even hundreds of thousands of dollars to pay security, potentially redirecting the funding from other necessary resources; the UC Berkeley paid $600,000 for a speech last year by conservative firebrand Ben Shapiro, while the University of Florida said they planned to spend $500,000 for Spencer’s speech. Amazingly, UC Berkeley spent just under $1 million — $1 million! — to host right-wing provocateur Milo Yiannopoulos. As the budgets for public universities continue to shrink, a legal requirement to shell out hundreds of thousands to controversial speakers poses a serious threat to the core mission of public schools.
So proponents of the First Amendment who despise Spencer and his disgusting message find themselves right back where they started. Maybe this is a challenge for higher education institutions to strengthen themselves and reject white supremacy in every form — to hire more faculty and administrators of color, to hold steadfast their commitment to diversity requirements in core classes, to pour funding into need-based scholarships for first-generation students, to create more robust cultural centers and to work more deliberately to create inclusive campuses and foster cross-cultural understanding. At its core, that means a greater financial and administrative commitment to combating white nationalism. 
It will take more purposeful effort. But it might create a more tolerant, inclusive and respectful future, not just on our college campuses, but also for the nation as a whole.

The annual Cupid’s Undie Run, which takes place in cities nationwide on the weekend before Valentine’s Day, is a fun-filled charity event that raises money for research into finding a cure for neurofibromatosis, a genetic disorder that causes tumors to form on nerve endings. Over 300 participants gathered for the Los Angeles iteration of the event at The Victorian in downtown Santa Monica, dressed in underwear, fluttering Cupid wings and sequined costumes. Despite the seriousness of the cause, the runners danced and laughed before embarking on a mile-long run to the beach and back.

“It’s a fun excuse to dress up and go on a fun little jog and dance and be with friends. It’s a really great event,” said Kate Logan, an attendee dressed in tighty whities and a flannel shirt. 
To participate, runners paid a $40 entrance fee, but many also competed to raise additional money for the cause. In total, the Los Angeles event brought in over $46,000, and 17 events across the country on Saturday made over $2 million altogether. 
The run is organized by Cupid’s Charity, a nonprofit started by a group of college students in the Washington, D.C. area when one of their friends was diagnosed with neurofibromatosis. 
“The first one was small, but they made $60,000 in a day,” said Steve McKenzie, a board member for the charity. “These were just a bunch of fun loving guys in their 20s, so they started branching out to more cities and a real organization.”
Neurofibromatosis affects approximately 1 in 3,000 children in the United States. It has three levels of severity, and can lead to cancer, losses in hearing and eyesight and painful growths around the spine and brain stem. Most symptoms begin to appear in early adulthood and can worsen over time, increasing the risk of premature death. 
Cupid’s Charity, which also organizes other charity events, donates all of its profits to the Children’s Tumor Foundation. Since the first Undie Run in 2010, the organization has raised over $15 million for neurofibromatosis, making it the largest source of non-governmental funding for research into the condition.
“There aren’t a lot of treatments and that’s unfortunate, but through our work here and Children’s Tumor Foundation, there’s a lot more clinical trials of more treatments on the horizon, so that we can continue to improve people’s lives,” Amy Boulas, Cupid’s Charity executive director, said. “That’s really powerful.”
Recently, the funding from the Undie Run has supported the creation and testing of a tumor suppression drug. 
“In some of the trials, with some kids, they’ve been able to shrink the tumor 50 percent,” said McKenzie, who also serves on the board of the Children’s Tumor Foundation. “Many of these tumors grow around the spine, the brain stem, places where surgery is extremely risky, sometimes not feasible, so if you can shrink the tumor it is fabulous.”
The seriousness of the cause did not deter participants from having some serious fun, however. Music boomed across two dance floors, and participants ate, drank and showed off their costumes at photo op areas throughout the event space. When the time finally came to run, they laughed and waved as passersby shot them confused looks.
“I’ve worked with non-profits for several years, this one’s a little bit more cutting edge, a little more out there, a little bit more fun than some of the more traditional, staid biking and running events out there,” Boulas said. 
Participants seemed to agree. “It’s like being at a wedding without a bride and groom,” runner Allen Natali said. “We’re all bridesmaids here.”

Hate is a strong word, especially when it comes to a day that’s dedicated to the opposite emotion, but my distaste for the revered holiday has only increased over the years. Don’t get me wrong; I think love is a wonderful concept, and I love discounted chocolates the day after, but the holiday most definitely rubs me the wrong way.
Art by Effren Villanueva | Daily Trojan
On Valentine’s Day, the difference between people who are single and those who are taken is never more apparent. For those who are single, Valentine’s Day is a blatant reminder of their relationship statuses. People have not-so-jokingly deemed it Singles Awareness Day for a reason, but on top of that, the day might trigger an unwelcome memory of an ex or bitter thoughts about an unrequited lover.  However, the day is a good opportunity for us single people to push through the sparkly hearts and impractical stuffed bears and practice some self-love. We can settle down with ice cream to binge watch our favorite series (as if we don’t do that already), and wait out the 24-hour time period that thankfully comes only once a year, before returning to our normal routines the following day.
The second group involves those who are taken. I use the term broadly to include a wide scope of people. From those in committed relationships to others who are in the “talking” stages, Valentine’s Day primarily acts as an excuse for couples to flaunt their relationship statuses while the former category looks on. Let’s be real — the luxury, 100-count boxes of roses are mainly for Instagram feeds and set unrealistic standards. They’re no more than fuel for a capitalist system, shrouded by the lovesick premise of the occasion. 
I suppose I should address the gray areas, too. Valentine’s Day can be the “make it or break it” mark for budding relationships. While it could be the final nudge toward becoming an official couple, it can also create issues for those who have yet to define the relationship but don’t want more than they already have. One person may be expecting a nice dinner and the promise of a grand future, while the other just wants to sit in the dorm alone. Cue the frosty feelings.
Feb. 14 forces us to stop and examine the concept of love and our understanding of it, as painful or joyous as that may be. But do we really need to devote an entire day to the notion of love and undying affection? It creates enormous pressure for both single people and those in relationships alike in a way that detracts from the original intent. Besides, people can demonstrate their care for their loved ones any day of the week, with or without the fanfare.

Valentine’s Day isn’t just a holiday for couples, it’s a holiday for celebrating love, whether that be love for your family, friends, pets, school or community. Some may say that Valentine’s Day is only fun and enjoyable when in a relationship, but it’s important to remember that romantic love isn’t the only love you can celebrate. 
Shideh Ghandeharizadeh | Daily Trojan
My parents would always get me presents for Valentine’s Day and give me an extra hug or a kiss that day, in celebration of the love we share as family. It was the same thing with my grandparents. Celebrating love doesn’t happen a lot, especially in a modern world more focused on current events and business and so often characterized  by hate. 
Valentine’s Day is a holiday for people of all races, genders, sexual orientations and social classes; it doesn’t exclude or discriminate. This holiday is a reminder that there is love in the world to be spread and shared with others. It’s a day to show those you love that you acknowledge their love and respect for you, and that you want to reciprocate it. I love Valentine’s Day because I feel fulfilled seeing my family happy and spreading love and positivity. Sometimes it can be hard for people to come to terms with not having a significant other, but that doesn’t mean they aren’t loved or cherished. 
Another thing I love about Valentine’s Day is the spirit of community it promotes. In elementary school, we used to exchange Valentine cards and candy. It wasn’t about who we had a crush on or who our friends were, it was about making someone feel special. Getting someone a gift or even just telling them you care can be monumental in making them feel special and appreciated. 
In the spirit of community, Valentine’s Day creates bonds between single people. They have their own parties and get each other gifts, celebrating each other and the holiday in doing so. Leslie Knope, a character played by Amy Poehler on Parks and Recreation, created Galentine’s Day, a Feb. 13 holiday on which “ladies celebrate ladies.” 
Valentine’s Day doesn’t just promote the love couples have for each other, but is about celebrating and loving the important people in your life. People criticize it for developing into a materialistic, Hallmark-dominated holiday, but it’s so much more than that. It’s a day to cherish loved ones and bring together those who mean the most to you.

Kitty Guo | Daily Trojan
At first, I didn’t realize that my column would be running on Valentine’s Day. And once I did, I resolved to continue right on with my predetermined schedule, amour be damned.
But in the deepest, darkest recesses of my heart, I’m secretly a sucker for these holidays — you know, like Thanksgiving and Christmas, denigrated as corporate money-making scams by cynics and promoted as joyous occasions for spreading love, cheer and goodwill by idealists. I try to play myself off as the former; really, I’m the latter. 
So, in the spirit of curdled ardor, I’ve decided to write about one of the most dysfunctional love stories of all time: Lolita. 
This won’t be a book review, because there is nothing I can say about Lolita that hasn’t already been said a million times — not its luxuriously undulating locution, its thicket-dense puns and jeu de mots, its structural complexity and its deliciously polarizing quality. I’m vastly underqualified to write about this artistic and literary tour de force. I’m capable only of genuflecting to Nabokov’s genius; I merely hover around the flame of his brilliance, fraught with the danger of getting scorched. 
One cover edition of Lolita, featuring the bare, knobby knees and saddle shoes of a schoolgirl, also includes a Vanity Fair quote: “The only convincing love story of our century.” I disrespectfully disagree with this sentiment. Let’s get one thing straight: Lolita is not actually a love story. Lolita is the story of a depraved, manipulative, ego-tripping homicidal maniac who took advantage of the trust of a vulnerable child so he could get his rocks off. And I’m censoring myself here. 
But for a good many of my formative years, like so many other pubescent girls discovering the double edged sword of sexuality, I thought it was. To be fair, Humbert’s rosy prose and duplicitous litotes have taken in many clear-headed adults who have long left those tumultuous, hormone-engulfed years behind. Precocious yet puerile, itching to shed my corporal form yet thrilled at the power it afforded me, I longed for someone older and wiser who could teach me his worldly ways. I envisioned a Humbert singling me out as special, affirming my dreams and desires as legitimate. 
Thankfully, I never took the next step to turn these fantasies into reality, as some girls do to disastrous results. I’m much too shy and risk-averse for that. Perhaps I was semi-aware, paradoxically, that any man who would openly express interest in a 14-year-old would cease to be a knight in shining armor and expose himself as the slimy, perverted creep he is, so that any consummation of my imaginations would simultaneously shatter them. 
Lolita has become so entrenched in the cultural consciousness that everyone already possesses preconceived notions of the novel, whether they have read it or not. The term “Lolita” has become synonymous with an underage temptress, as ignoramuses labor under the delusion that she was the one who lured him into sin with her juvenile feminine charms. In fact, nothing could be further from the truth; Lolita is the story of a relationship between a twisted, pedophilic, abusive adult and the child he victimizes, and the sooner the heinously misguided myth that the two are in any way on equal footing is dispelled the better. 
Happy Valentine’s Day, everyone!

Trojans’ freshman wide receiver Joseph Lewis IV was arrested Monday afternoon on charges of domestic violence, ESPN’s Kyle Bonagura reported. Los Angeles County Jail records show Lewis was booked at 4:45 p.m. and released early Tuesday morning. USC announced he is currently suspended from team activities. 
According to USCFootball.com, Lewis is suspected of inflicting corporal injury on a spouse or cohabitant. A corporal injury is defined as a domestic battery that leaves a visible injury on the victim. The initial booking sheet said the arrest was made at 2 p.m. in Los Angeles and that the bail was set at $50,000. The felony charge carries a maximum punishment of four years in prison if Lewis is found guilty. Lewis is set to appear in court on March 6. 
According to Bonagura, LAPD officer Mike Lopez stated that the case will be presented to the Los Angeles County District Attorney’s office in the near future. The LAPD did not release any specific details about the incident. 
A five-star recruit out of Los Angeles’ Hawkins High School, the 6-foot-2, 205-pound player was 247Sports’ fourth-ranked wide receiver and 31st-ranked overall prospect in the class of 2017. 
Lewis saw minimal playing time in his debut season appearing in three games and catching four passes for 39 yards. Against Washington State, Lewis recorded two catches for 21 yards, with a long of 14. 
He was positioned to take on an expanded role next season with the departures of receivers senior Steven Mitchell Jr. and junior Deontay Burnett, who declared early for the NFL Draft. 
“USC takes all reports of domestic abuse seriously and is cooperating fully with the law enforcement investigation,” a USC spokesperson said in a statement e-mailed to the Daily Trojan. “While this student code of conduct issue is being investigated, the student has been suspended from all football-related activities. Student disciplinary records and student conduct proceedings are confidential at USC and protected by law.”
USC is scheduled to begin spring practice in early March. It is unclear if Lewis will be able to participate, given his current suspension. 
Redshirt freshman Tyler Vaughns and sophomore Michael Pittman Jr. will return as the team’s top two leading receivers from last season.
CORRECTION: A previous version of this article contained a photo of a player that was incorrectly identified as Joseph Lewis. The photo has been removed. The Daily Trojan regrets the error.

On Wednesday, the No. 15 ranked USC men’s volleyball team will make the short trip to Westwood to take on the No. 2 ranked UCLA Bruins. After recently losing to No. 7 BYU in a four-set match, they will look to continue the momentum from their previous five-set match victory against Stanford. 
Setting up for success · Freshman setter Chris Hall (6) sets up freshman middle blocker Sam Lewis (23) for a shot against Stanford last Thursday. No. 15 USC’s win over the Cardinal represents the team’s signature victory so far this season. Ling Luo | Daily Trojan
The Trojans will rely on the versatile hitting from junior Ryan Moss. They will look to senior outside hitter Jack Wyett and junior outside hitter Gianluca Grasso to execute on offense while also contributing strong defense. Redshirt junior Connor Inlow will continue to be an offensive force in the middle blocker position, and junior libero Matt Douglas will try to run the Trojan defense for setters redshirt senior Gert Lisha and freshman Chris Hall. All the players will look to hit tough serves to put UCLA out of system. 
The Bruins have junior Christian Hessenauer, a strong right-side hitter in the opposite position. They will also depend on senior outside hitters JT Hatch and Jake Arnitz. Senior middle blocker Oliver Martin will pose a threat to the Trojans along with freshman hitter Grant Maleski. Setter Micah Ma’a will bring his consistency to the court to help UCLA find its rhythm. 
The Bruins have had a successful season so far, recently sweeping Concordia in Irvine in their MPSF opener. They currently hold a 13-1 record, while the Trojans are 4-8. UCLA has hit at least .400 in their last four matches, displaying their consistency and discipline. 
USC’s players will have their work cut out for them, but they are focusing on themselves and their game. 
“It’s going to be a hard-fought battle,” senior opposite hitter Jon Rivera said. “They’re a top ranked team and we’re on the road. It’s gonna be difficult. We’re preparing the same as we do every week because we’re just trying to get better on our side of the net.” 
After a rocky start to the season, redshirt junior Jack Wyett said he sees plenty of room for improvement.
“All we can do is control what’s on our side of the net,” Wyett said. “We have an extremely talented roster top to bottom, so once we piece that together we can beat any team.”
While the Trojans still have a substantial amount of building to do, they are working on some specifics to beat UCLA.
“We’re working on our blocking mainly,” sophomore opposite hitter Aaron Strange said. “Making sure we’re solid on our pin blocking, because when we played BYU we struggled to adjust on our opposite pin blocking. Their hitter killed us. Other than that, defensive tenacity. Getting those random balls that skimp over the net to set up a good play so we can make a good hit. And we’re working on serving. Just consistency across the board and making adjustments.”
The men’s volleyball team will have to find its confidence going into UCLA and rely on their trust in each other as teammates. They will use this game to improve and follow this away game with another game on the road as they travel to No. 12-ranked Pepperdine on Saturday.

Last season marked a huge step forward for the USC beach volleyball team. Not only did they capture the national championship for the third consecutive year and win the Pac-12 Championship last May, but they also finished the season nearly undefeated, with their only loss coming from the UCLA Bruins. 
The Trojans return a shot against Pepperdine last season. Daily Trojan file photo.
The Trojans also cemented themselves among the elite programs in college sports history by becoming the first beach volleyball program to win three consecutive titles. 
While 2017 was all about continuing to make history, the 2018 season will be yet another opportunity for USC to continue its dynasty and cement itself as the standard for beach volleyball programs across the nation.
The preseason No. 1 Trojans will once again be led by head coach Anna Collier, who enters her seventh season as the leader of the team with a 146-18 overall record and an .890 winning percentage. After guiding her team to an undefeated 2015 season and the AVCA National Championship, Collier became the first head coach to reach the 100-win plateau after USC tacked on a program-best 34 wins in 2016. In 2017, Collier continued to lead the program with yet another national championship and a 38-1 season.
This season, however, the Trojans will look to new and old faces to continue their run as the pinnacle program in the nation.
The biggest loss for this year’s Trojan team will unquestionably be the departures of senior All-Americans Kelly Claes and Sara Hughes. The duo posted a perfect 48-0 record in 2016 and dropped just one set on the year, extending their remarkable winning streak to 73 matches in a row dating back to the 2015 season. 
In 2017, Claes and Hughes continued their run of dominance by posting a 55-1 record and solidifying their reputation as the most elite duo in NCAA history. Now, the pair is dominating the AVP professional circuit. 
Among those who will look to soften the blow of losing two beach volleyball legends will be senior Terese Cannon, an all Pac-12 second team performer last year and will be looked upon to take on a bigger load. Also, the Trojans brought in reinforcements in the form of four freshmen: Tina Graudina, Haley Hallgren, Maja Kaiser and Sammy Slater. 
Among the group, Graudina, who hails from Latvia, stands out as the first-ever international recruit in the program’s history. She recently captured gold at the 2016 CEV European U22 Championships in Thessaloniki, Greece, the 2015 CEV U18 European Championship in Riga, Latvia, and the 2014 CEV Youth Continental Cup in Umag, Croatia.
The Trojans will be faced with a solid test to open the season at the Arizona State tournament on Feb. 24, where they will face Pac-12 rivals Arizona State, Nebraska and Cal Poly. 
Soon thereafter, the Trojans will face their first true challenges of the season when they face perennial championship contender Pepperdine as well as crosstown rival UCLA at home on Feb. 28. UCLA finished last season as the No. 5 team with a 30-6 record while Pepperdine finished as the runner-up to the Trojans and ended the season with a 27-5 record. Both matches will be broadcast on the Pac-12 network.

The NBA season can be a slog for players and coaches alike, especially leading up to the All-Star Break, which begins later this week. At this point in the year, teams have played nearly 60 games in three months without more than four days of rest in between contests. It’s an exhausting stretch both physically and mentally for athletes.
That’s part of the reason why on Monday, Golden State Warriors coach Steve Kerr chose to break up the monotony by letting his players coach against the lowly Phoenix Suns (18-40). Draymond Green (who was out with a finger injury), Andre Iguodala and David West drew up the team’s plays during timeouts, and the Warriors smacked the Suns by 46 — of course they did.
Golden State did this, like so many of their other incredible basketball feats, because they can. The Warriors are essentially a self-driving car at this point.
When Kerr missed extended time during the 2016-17 season due to back pain, interim coach Luke Walton went 39-4 and landed a job with the Lakers for his, um, efforts (anyone could have coached the Warriors to at least 30 wins during that span). They went on to record the best regular season record in NBA history.
It may seem like another example of the Warriors being the Warriors, and doing whatever they want because they know they’ll probably win anyways, especially against Phoenix (at least one Suns’ player, veteran forward Jared Dudley, saw the move as disrespectful). But maybe Kerr is onto something here.
“It’s the players’ team, and they have to take ownership of it,” Kerr explained to ESPN’s Chris Haynes. “As coaches, our job is to nudge them in the right direction, guide them, but we don’t control them.”
I read that quote and started thinking about the role of coaches in the NBA. Do players really need them in order to be successful or could they run a team on their own?
Some NBA coaches play vital roles in their team’s successes. The San Antonio Spurs’ Gregg Popovich is obviously one of the greatest coaches of all-time in any sport, so we can go ahead and excuse him from this discussion. Other than the five-time NBA champion, the league’s elite class of coaches looks pretty thin.
Kerr and the Boston Celtics’ Brad Stevens have been revelations since arriving at their respective teams. Both changed the Warriors’ and Celtics’ culture and on-court mentality, in the process making each team elite in a very short time span. Meanwhile, the Miami Heat’s Erik Spoelstra, the Mavericks’ Rick Carlisle and the Houston Rocket’s Mike D’Antoni are regarded as some of the game’s greatest tacticians, perpetually leading barren rosters to overachieving seasons (and winning championships with talented rosters). 
Outside of that group, most NBA coaches are expendable and liable to be fired at any time, especially when a star player clashes with them. It happened when Orlando Magic center Dwight Howard demanded coach Stan Van Gundy’s departure in 2012. It happened when Stephon Marbury disagreed with basically every coach he played for. It’s even widely accepted that LeBron James made the decision to cut ties with Cleveland Cavaliers’ head coach David Blatt in the middle of the 2015-16 season. 
If most coaches are mere figureheads and players run teams anyways, maybe it’s time for the player-coaches to emerge as an option for teams in the NBA. 
It’d be a great way for aging athletes to transition into the coaching world seamlessly (unlike recent player-turned-coaches who were fired quickly such as Derek Fisher, Jason Kidd and Earl Watson). They’d already carry the respect of their peers, along with the ability to reach and motivate them. In basketball, where overall offensive philosophy is paramount over individual play-calling, players could slip in and out of the coaching role more freely than in other sports. 
Player-coaches were commonplace in the NBA during the 1960s and 70s. For example, NBA legend Bill Russell coached and played for the Celtics for three seasons. In an NBA era when coaches are as inessential as ever, it’s time for a revival. 
“It’s their team,” Kerr said to ESPN. “I think that’s one of the first things you have to consider as a coach.” 
In such a player-driven league, maybe it’s time to consider having players coach themselves. 
Here are a couple of things I enjoyed in sports this week. 
Chloe Kim
In a U.S. Winter Olympics team devoid of big-names besides Shaun White and Lindsey Vonn, 17-year-old snowboarder Chloe Kim has taken the country by storm. On Monday, she captured the gold medal for halfpipe with a stunning score of 98.25. In many ways, she’s the perfect Olympic star for today’s generation — she’s the child of immigrants and she tweets about food in between runs. In Pyeongchang, the United States found its next star in Kim. She’ll no doubt anchor the U.S. Olympic team for years to come. 
JuJu’s social media post of the week
Former USC and current Pittsburgh Steelers wide receiver JuJu Smith-Schuster can’t stop going viral. This time, he posted a video of his mom nagging him to do chores. “I’m an NFL player, I can’t be brooming and sweeping this trash,” Smith-Schuster pleads, to which his mom replies, “You ain’t sh-t. Hurry up.” NFL star or not, you’re never too old to disobey your mom.
