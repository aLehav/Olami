When examining the music industry of the past decade, one may be hard-pressed to pinpoint exactly when streaming platforms were introduced. The emergence of services like Spotify and Pandora and their progression from start-ups to industry behemoths, seem blurry. 
Still, it is certain that the vast majority of us have logged on to one of these sites and streamed our favorite artists at one time or another. Yet, student musicians and other industry professionals contend that streaming has been detrimental to artists’ bottom lines for a variety of reasons.
The low royalty rate paid to artists for each stream poses the most glaring issue. Shortly after the boom of Spotify and Apple Music, the price paid to artists per stream on each platform has been a point of contention between the tech industry and the music business. Today, a musician on Spotify would need close to 90,000 streams to match the U.S. monthly minimum wage of $1,472 — a paltry royalty rate to say the least. 
Also, musicians have vocalized their distaste for streaming services and the effect they’ve had on the overall perception of the value of music. Jay-Z went so far as to call streaming platforms “criminal” and believes that streaming has enabled the general public to “feel like music is free.” 
In the past, artists like Beyoncé and Taylor Swift have famously restricted their music from distribution on streaming platforms with free tiers, opting instead to only include their work on services that require paid subscriptions.
Musicians and industry professionals have concerns surrounding music streaming that are both valid and understandable. However, streaming culture has brought about myriad benefits both for the music industry and society as a whole.
Perhaps the most obvious benefit of streaming is that practically the entire last century of recorded music is now available to us at the click of a button. Gone are the days of scouring through record stores only to walk out empty-handed. Today, every new release is delivered to our devices on Friday mornings alongside our weather forecasts and news briefings.
Streaming culture should also be commended for increasing the accessibility of a musical artist’s work. Decades ago, aspiring musicians were tasked with tracking down any and every record label employee they could find in hopes of getting their demos heard. Even then, there was no guarantee that they would be signed to a label. Today, anyone with access to Pro Tools and a suitable microphone can have their work heard. Yes, this means that even the bad apples can be picked, but it also provides countless opportunities for extraordinary musicians around the world to share their music when they could not have otherwise. 
Moreover, streaming is slowly turning the music industry back into a business that is predicated on singles instead of albums. On the surface, this may not seem like something to celebrate, especially from an industry perspective (after all, album sales bring in way more money than singles). Nonetheless, record labels can use this trend to their advantage. Instead of giving new artists multimillion-dollar advances to record full-length albums, they can cut costs in order to focus on one-song or two-song releases, or even short EPs. Doing so would offset the potential loss of low album sales and allow for other efforts — like marketing and merchandising — to be funded more.
True, music streaming companies still have lots of work to do to increase the amount of compensation given to artists who distribute their work through each platform. The general public should reflect on how streaming has impacted the ways in which we consume and value music: Are we more appreciative of the craft now that we have access to everything that’s ever been produced? Or are we increasingly treating it as a disposable commodity?
In any case, streaming tends to be unnecessarily criticized and derided, especially from an industry perspective. The executives over at Spotify and Apple Music are going to depend on users pressing play for quite a while longer, and the music industry has no choice but to accept and adapt to this.

As the rest of campus lay dormant on a rainy Saturday morning, over a thousand people made their way to the third-annual USC OWN IT Summit, a day-long event celebrating women’s empowerment. The summit, full of glass-ceiling demolishers, eager academics and open discussions, was a sharp contrast to the day’s gloomy weather.   
The summit was put together entirely by students. Attendees attended two breakout sessions of their choice along with longer speeches and panels throughout the event. Among the 150 guest speakers were Erin and Sara Foster, co-creative heads for Bumble; Maryellis Bunn, founder of the Museum of Ice Cream and Willow Bay, dean of the USC Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism. 
In Bovard Auditorium, actress and outspoken transgender activist Laverne Cox addressed the packed house with personal stories of discrimination and spoke about the importance of intersectional feminism.
“Intersectional feminism … has really been about expanding the category of womanhood,” she said. “I stand before you today as a black transgender woman claiming my womanhood.” 
Erica Wenger, co-executive director of USC OWN IT, said the rain affected the summit’s outdoor activities, such as the marketplace, where sponsors had booths for attendees to sample products.
“Thursday night we made a last minute-decision to do our rain plan, which was very expensive, but obviously very worth it,” Wenger said. “We moved the marketplace [from Alumni Park to VKC], and we put a huge tent over lunch.”  
In an afternoon breakout session titled “Wellness & Womanhood,” Jessie De Lowe, co-founder of the lifestyle blog How You Glow, spoke about her experience becoming an art therapist. De Lowe, who studied art and psychology at the University of Colorado, discussed the ways traditional Western medicine often fail to address women’s basic mental health needs.
“I found that in the art classes, there was way more [therapy] occurring than even in some of these other classrooms,” De Lowe said. “[Art has the power] to create this really healing environment for people to open up.” 
The summit featured speakers covering topics from religion to aerospace engineering. Carlin Pappas, a senior majoring in journalism, attended a breakout session on corporate social responsibility. 
“I learned a lot,” Pappas said. “I think one of the big takeaways [was that] consumers are more likely to associate with a brand that does social activism.” 
Attendees also heard from three women who founded their own companies that focus on the needs of consumers in new and innovative ways. Tina Sharkey, co-founder and CEO of Brandless — an e-commerce company that sells all of its products for $3 each — said her company seeks to build trust with consumers.
“People don’t want to be buying from companies that they don’t trust or admire,” Sharkey said. “Every day for us [is] day two. Because on day one we listen, and on day two we build.”  
Francesca Macrae, a senior majoring in political economy, echoed Sharkey’s sentiments on brands. 
“Consumers are more willing to support brands that no longer are just trying to push a product, but are using their platform to push a message,” Macrae said. 
Wenger said she was happy with the event. She said Cox and the Bumble creatives were among her favorite parts of the event. 
“One of my cousins actually said this was a day she was going to remember for years and [that] changed her life,” Wenger said. “Overall, we just kept hearing really positive feedback.”

After her mother passed away during her freshman year of high school, Alexis Augustine found that therapy became an outlet for her to address her mental health. But when she told some of her family and friends that she had been seeking professional help, she was taken aback by the judgement that followed.
As a result, Augustine, then a high school senior in New Orleans, founded Change the Stigma, a nonprofit initiative dedicated to fostering meaningful and inclusive discourse about mental health among young people.
“I didn’t get the reactions from people that I wanted,” said Augustine, now a freshman majoring in psychology. “It was heartbreaking — and out of that, I started reaching out to people to see if [others] wanted to talk about [these issues].” 
When she began reaching out to her friends to join Change the Stigma, Augustine realized that more people needed to be in a safe environment to comfortably discuss their mental health struggles.
Founded in 2017, CTS originally began for students in Augustine’s community to work toward the destigmatization of mental health issues through open discussions. 
Since then, the nonprofit has grown into an organization that centers its efforts on arts initiatives dedicated to the broader topics of diversity, mental health, equality and representation. Augustine helped coordinate public productions at local theaters and creative spaces with fellow CTS members.
“We make a production that highlights a [stigmatized topic],” Augustine said. “The performances are supposed to be thought-provoking.”
Augustine said that during a production in 2017, which showcased spoken word poetry, musical numbers and even a live jazz band, she found that audience members were moved by a performance illustrating the transgender experience. 
“The ones that I have put on at home have really changed a lot of people’s minds on certain things,” Augustine said. “My grandma went to my show and she’s very old school … [and] said that she has never thought about these types of things.” 
When Augustine came to USC in August, she was determined to find a group of creative and dedicated students with similar aspirations to establish a campus chapter of the nonprofit. Through her dance minor classes, Augustine met freshman Isabella Allen, a freshman majoring in dance. after discovering that they shared similar interests, Allen became CTS Vice President.
“Especially while we’re being educated in an institution [such as USC], it’s good to have discussions on things that are not brought up in regular lectures,” Allen said. “[We should be] open to growing in your awareness of things outside of your own life or personal life and learn[about] other people’s own experience.” 
Augustine said that a shared passion for encouraging creativity and increasing awareness about mental health issues is what initially brought the two students together.
“Psychology is my major, and dance is my minor,” Augustine said. “Dance is [Allen’s] major and neuroscience is going to be her minor … [so she was the] perfect person to be my vice president.” 
Augustine and Allen spent last semester organizing a team of eight freshmen from various schools and backgrounds at USC to join the organization. The unique team comprises students majoring in accounting, public policy and environmental studies, among others. 
CTS member Yahm Steinberg, a freshman majoring in theatre, said she hopes that CTS can bring students together to address issues such as discrimination through different art mediums.
“I do think there are a lot of harmful stigma and stereotypes in society that contribute to bigger problems, like microaggressions are ultimately something that build up and lead to things like racism, anti-semitism, sexism,” Steinberg said. “Art is a beautiful way to try and make a change … and as someone who considers themselves a social activist and artist, the combination of the two things are appealing to me.” 
CTS was officially recognized as a USC student organization this semester, and Augustine already has a topic for the organization’s first production on campus. 
“[Allen] and I are really interested in dance therapy,” Augustine said. “I want to highlight how art is therapeutic and how that can change stigma.” 
Though the production is still in its planning stage and doesn’t have a performance date yet, Augustine is excited to welcome new members to the organization. Nearly 100 students expressed interest at Thursday’s involvement fair, according to Augustine.
“We’re going to have a lot of talented minds to bounce ideas off of,” Augustine said. 
Augustine hopes that through CTS, USC students will help change the climate surrounding mental health issues.
“This is needed in a lot of people’s lives,” Augustine said. “Just discussion about the things we are not discussing … [and] especially with college-age students, [for us] it is a very vulnerable time so I think it could be beneficial to be open.”

The USC Sol Price School of Public Policy is one of six top public policy universities collaborating for a new Public Affairs Diversity Alliance, according to an announcement by American University on Jan. 3.
The Alliance consists of Price, the Maxwell School of Citizenship and Public Affairs at Syracuse University, the Ford School of Public Policy at the University of Michigan, the Sanford School of Public Policy at Duke University and the Evans School at the University of Washington. For the first two years, the Alliance will be spearheaded by the American University School of Public Affairs. 
Each participating university will hire up to two Alliance postdoctoral fellows or visiting scholars each year to support diversity within the school’s upper-level programs. After the fellows are instated, they will be guided by a mentor from their own school, as well as a mentor from another participating university. 
Throughout their studies, the fellows will also be provided with programming that will be centered around their post-graduation careers.
LaVonna Lewis, the associate dean of Diversity, Equity and Inclusion at Price, will oversee the integration of the Alliance fellows at USC. 
“Having more students of color coming through is one benefit,” Lewis said. “And I think it’ll help both the research and the learning environments on those campuses because you’ll have alumni and participants who will bring in different perspectives to campuses.” 
Increasing diversity among faculty improves outcomes for underrepresented students, according to a study by Gary Oates, a professor at Bowling Green State University. By joining other Alliance schools, Price hopes to strengthen its emphasis on diversity and better outcomes in terms of faculty placement,  Price Dean Jack H. Knott said.
Jorge Tapia, a first year graduate student in public administration, said more students want universities to prioritize diversity in their faculty. 
“There’s an expectation from students to see diversity in their professors and faculty,” Tapia said. “I think it’s kind of a reflection of the times that we’re living in to kind of see more diversity in the line of academia.” 
The academic background of Price faculty varies, with professors specializing in a wide range of topics and coming from universities from across the country. However, some Price students feel that the racial diversity of the faculty can be improved. Of the 27 tenured faculty members in 2016, 21 identified as white while one identified as black, three as Asian and two as two or more races. There were no Hispanic or Latino tenured faculty members in 2016. 
“There’s a lot of intellectual diversity, but I wouldn’t say there’s a lot of racial diversity,” said Andy Kim, a freshman majoring in public policy.
Knott hopes to inspire other universities to increase the diversity of doctorate programs, while increasing the diversity of Price itself by successfully recruiting and supporting fellows, according to an article on the Price School website.
“We hope this mentorship and nurturing of postdocs into good jobs becomes a model other schools want to emulate,” Knott said in the article. “In the future, some of these schools will want to join the Alliance.” 
Lewis said the Alliance’s programming will attempt to create an inclusive learning environment with a robust research agenda. She also plans to make any programming held at USC available to other Price postdoctoral fellows who could benefit from diversity networking and events.
“When we’re hosting programs that are a part of the Alliance, we’ll make sure that our other students will be available to access that programming,” Lewis said. “Our idea is kind of blending and making sure what’s considered … best practices get shared to as many students as possible.” 
The universities are expecting their first Alliance fellows in Fall 2019.

Presidential exploratory committees are already being formed, and there is a tension in the air as the U.S. braces for 2020. Even a normal election season is characterized by polarizing headlines, polarizing people and polarizing ideas. It’s unpleasant, and it’s bizarre; complicated ideas are marketed as simple binaries, people argue with their friends and have to awkwardly watch as people like Michael Bloomberg try to relate to farmers in Iowa. Even worse, this won’t be a normal election. President Donald Trump is the physical manifestation of a strawman argument, and that’s going to make everything in the presidential election season go from terrible to even worse. 
However, despite the negative aspects of an increasingly political culture, election season is something to embrace, not dread. 
In the U.S., and at USC in particular, aversion to political involvement is not new. According to the Pew Research Center, only 56 percent of voting-age citizens casted ballots in 2016, trailing the voter turnout rate of most other developed nations. Political apathy is even more dire at USC. 
In 2016, UCLA was able to register over 10,000 students in a voter registration competition against the University, while USC only registered 411. Since the VoteSC 2018 initiative, USC has seen a sharp increase in voter registration levels, yet the student body still proportionally trails its less population-dense crosstown rival — and the general population — by a significant margin. 
USC’s political apathy may have understandable causes, but such justification is selfish. People don’t engage in the political process because they read headlines that imply they must take action, and that scares them away. Many people would rather not pick a side at all than educate themselves on issues and risk being questioned about their decisions. This risk-averse behavior assumes that because one is involved in politics, politics comes to define them. And by abstaining from participation, they absolve their culpability in the outcome. 
This viewpoint is flawed for many reasons. Politics isn’t just about the voter. Politics is about people born 40 years from now who want ample access to drinking water. It’s about people in Yemen whose villages run the risk of being wiped off the face of the Earth every minute of every day. It’s about the patient with an autoimmune disease who wonders if she’ll have to choose between shelter or medical treatment if her insurance provider is given permission to charge extra for her pre-existing condition. 
In a democracy like ours, the fate of these people lies in the hands of voters. The majority of Americans and the majority of USC students are eligible, voting-age U.S. citizens. 
Abstaining from politics leaves decision-making to disproportionately powerful private actors with vested interests in advancing their profits rather than the common good. Political apathy abandons vulnerable populations in need of the support that could be easily given if more Americans didn’t see politics as a mess. 
The upcoming election and its ensuing changes to legislation, executive positions and other parts of government aren’t the most interesting to talk about, and it’s definitely not the most pleasant, but those concerns are secondary when compared to the needs of those whose fate lies with public policy. 
Granted, increased engagement doesn’t ensure better outcomes, but it does encourage more authenticity. By surrendering political impact, one also surrenders its effects on one another, leaving people to be governed by lawmakers elected to protect only the shrinking minority of the population who put them in power.  
In political conversations, USC students should not shut down, but instead listen. Even if they aren’t interested, it’s a civic duty to be involved, because no matter how little students believe these issues affect them, so many others are affected. Regardless of how little students understand at the moment, it’s going to be on the test in November 2020, and people are counting on voters to pass.

What would Jane Jacobs do?
This question is part of the Facebook page URL for the group New Urbanist Memes for Transit Oriented Teens, a page where members partake in discussions about public transit, share memes about gentrification and construct maps of transit lines connecting all the Taco Bells in Austin, Texas. The members’ sacred text is revolutionary urbanist Jane Jacobs’ masterpiece, “The Death and Life of Great American Cities,” and their vision is the most efficient city: one that runs solely on electricity, without a single car in sight.
Younger generations are often written off when it comes to politics and policy change — Generation X and millennials comprise the majority of the voter population, but have low voter turnout, according to the Pew Research Center. Despite these numbers, young urbanists turn out for issues that affect them on the municipal level.
As a proud NUMTOT member, I’ve been mired in discussions about the San Francisco Bay Area Rapid Transit system and its efficiency in connecting over 100 miles of track along Northern California’s most densely populated area. As a result of  these online discussions, I’ve participated in several BART surveys, as well as the D-CA 17th District town hall in San Jose, where community members raised local concerns about how opening a new BART station affects their lifestyles and the city itself.
 NUMTOT members’ passion for urbanism seeps into the minds of even those not even in the group — I share my love for all things trains with almost anyone I travel with, and lament the use of ride-hailing services instead of public transit to exasperated Lyft drivers.
The most recent Millennial Impact Report from 2017 found that “millennials are driven to engage locally more than nationally. Even those who engage nationally don’t reduce their local activity as a result.” Many of the issues they advocate for have direct consequences on their own lives. The Guardian reports that the various interests this age group has — environmentalism, equality and affordable housing — intersect with urbanism.
It makes sense: Younger generations are worried about the state of cities, the state of the environment and the density of human life due to the ensuing threat of overpopulation. They raise awareness of cross-city parallels like poor highway planning and excess car fuel emissions through niche memes and sardonically aware texts posts. 
The goal? To share a laugh, but also to teach others more about local issues and ideate solutions for the long term.
Almost 135,000 members strong, the page has many relatives — NUMTinder was created for those interested in urbanist issues to find possible romantic relationships, and an entire page exists dedicated to memes solely about New York City’s Metropolitan Transportation Agency. 
These groups aren’t all relegated to Facebook — the Instagram community of urban photographers is hundreds strong. Some very popular Reddit threads explore experiences on public transit and city planning, and Tumblr accounts like McMansion Hell, a satirical commentary blog on excessively and inefficiently ornamented suburban houses, intend to “educate the masses about architectural concepts, urban planning, environmentalism and history.”
But beyond social media platforms, the increased interest in urbanism is visible in traditional education and career pathways. The Price School of Public Policy enrolled 2,028 students last fall, an uptick of almost 200 students from the year before. Apps like CitySwipe, described by the Guardian as “Tinder for cities,” aim to gather opinions of the general public and promote more inclusive urban planning. 
Younger generations are interested in policy change that affects their daily lives, an increase in bike lanes and caps on fuel emissions to lower smog levels. This doesn’t mean they are politically unengaged. 
This column is a beginner’s foray into the state of city matters. I hope to spark interest in the rise of urbanism and all of its related social issues — gentrification, homelessness, inequality — and perhaps incite readers to take action, whether it be participating in the upcoming election or entirely switching one’s field of study to urban studies and planning. By sharing my own experiences, I hope that others may find cities and urban life just as beautiful and problematic as I do.
Breanna de Vera is a sophomore writing about urban planning. She is also the opinion editor of the Daily Trojan. Her column, “Where the Sidewalk Starts” runs Mondays.
