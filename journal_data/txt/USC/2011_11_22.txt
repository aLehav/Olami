The Center for Population Health and Health Disparities (CPHHD) at USC and UCLA are making a combined effort to take on cardiovascular diseases in Los Angeles.
The organization, which came up in May 2010, is currently examining eight grocery stores in the eastern part of the city as part of its efforts to provide healthy food items in the area. Organic foods and vegetables have been made available in general stores, where, earlier, canned sodas and cigarettes were being provided.
To bring about this change, the organization covered about 150 stores and spoke to their owners, customers and neighbors to understand the food dynamics in the region. The changes to business owners were now suggested and they accepted it after much deliberation.
A transformation can be seen, for example, in the “YASH The House,” which was a traditional grocery and liquor and snuff store. It now houses fresh vegetables and fruits from surrounding farms and grown organically. The vegetables include cauliflower, peppers and green beans.

With Thanksgiving just around the corner, many USC students have already left campus for their homes and families. This year, however, Thanksgiving break is notably more expensive, from flights to turkey.
Orbitz Worldwide noted a jump in demand for Thanksgiving airfare, resulting in an 11 percent cost increase for flights to 10 of America’s top destinations. Flights to New York saw the most drastic jump, increasing 20 percent to an average round-trip price of $342. However, flights to Los Angeles are not far behind, rising 12 percent to $429.
This spike in airfare is accompanied by a rise in hotel fees as well, with the average hotel rate for 25 of America’s hot destinations rising nearly 5 percent, according to TravelClick Inc.
For those who belive they are saving travel costs by driving to their Thanksgiving destination, think again: Gas prices reached the highest levels in history last week. The average price in the Los Angeles-Long Beach area was a record 66 cents higher than this time last year, reaching $3.82 per gallon.
In addition to elevated airfare and hotel costs, the American Farm Bureau Federation predicts that the cost of a Thanksgiving dinner for 10 people will increase by 13 percent, the most notable increase in two decades. The cost is now estimated to be $49.20, $5.73 more than the 2010 projected cost. The biggest chunk of that cost is the price of turkey, which has increased due to high demand in the US and globally.

Snoop Dogg and Wiz Khalifa starring in their own stoner flick? Sounds like potentially one of the worst ideas to come out of the music business lately — but then again, there was P.O.I.
Yesterday, the two rappers, dubiously known for their association with and admiration of Mary Jane (and we’re not talking Watson here), released the track listing for the sound track to their upcoming film, Mac and Devin Go To High School.
If the title isn’t enough to make you wonder how Snoop Dogg is going to pass off as a teenager for an entire hour and a half when his music has literally been around for longer than most current USC students have been alive, then the song titles will make you wonder just how high Snoop and Wiz got the record companies and film studios when they okay’ed the sound track.
Let’s take a look:
“Smokin’ On” feat. Juicy J
“I Get Lifted”
“You Can Put it in a Zag, I’mma Put it in a Blunt” — imagine this one being read out at the Oscars for Best Original Song. Maybe Billy Crystal could pull it off.
“Young, Wild & Free” feat. Bruno Mars — already pretty popular, but still most definitely about weed.
“French Inhale” feat. Mike Posner — honestly, these are just getting a little tiring at this point.
And those are just the highlights. There’s no doubt that the other half of the album is just as classy and  PC as the aforementioned tunes. If its the case, this movie is shaping up to be on the undesirable list, for sure.

With the USC-UCLA rivalry game fast approaching, the battle is making its way into Hollywood. The film industry is awash with stars from the two schools  — celebrity USC grads include George Lucas, Judd Apatow and Bryan Lourd, while Francis Ford Coppola, Stacey Snider and Jack Black are some of the more well-noted UCLA alums. So, it came as no surprise when Trojan Will Ferrell and Bruin alum Will Forte engaged in some good-old trash talk ahead of the big game.
In an interview to The Hollywood Reporter (THR), Will Forte raised the ire of Trojan fans by saying, “I don’t really associate with USC fans. A certain type of person goes there — they aren’t good people. They’re very entitled, the type of person that will not hold the door for an old woman. They’ll intentionally walk a blind person into traffic. That’s what you’re working with at that school.”
Ferrell, though, responded in kind. The Step Brothers star told THR, “It’s funny  — ever since USC surpassed UCLA in the U.S. News & World Report rankings, there’s been edginess among the Bruin faithful. We have always maintained athletic dominance, and now that we have academic superiority, you just feel sorry for people who have anything to do with UCLA.”

For most of Pac-12 volleyball play, it looked as though the season finale between No. 1 USC and No. 4 UCLA would decide who took the conference title.
The Bruins took some luster off that matchup last weekend by losing in an upset to Arizona, ceding the Pac-12 crown to the Women of Troy, but make no mistake — USC has plenty of motivation to conclude the regular season by beating its cross-town rivals.
In USC’s home opener earlier this year, UCLA came in front of a record crowd at the Galen Center and swept the Women of Troy to kick off conference play.
There’s been a bad taste in USC coach Mick Haley’s mouth ever since.
“We walked in here, put [5,385] people in the place, and stunk it up and lost 3-0,” Haley said. “We’re going to do everything we can to beat the Bruins, I guarantee that.”
Fortunately, even if that doesn’t happen, the Women of Troy are in great position to claim a No. 1 seed in the 64-team NCAA tournament.
Their title of the champions of the Pac-12, arguably the best volleyball conference in the nation, will no doubt hold weight with the selection committee.
Haley is ecstatic that his squad could earn that title a week earlier than expected.
“You can only go so long before you crash,” Haley said. “This [match] gives us a break before the [NCAA] tournament starts. We’ll be up for UCLA. We’ll play hard, we’ll try to win, but it’s not like we have to.”
Haley stressed that the team is preparing hard, but admits there is definitely more of a relaxed atmosphere in practice this week.
The preparation is fun, we’re looking forward to the match,” Haley said. “We would look forward to it anyway, but we won’t be as tired and we won’t be stressed.”
Since their loss to the Bruins, the Women of Troy have won 19 of their 20 matches, only losing on the road to No. 10 California, and enter the season finale on a seven-match winning streak.
UCLA, on the other hand, has been upset in two of their past four matches, skidding through the end of its schedule and essentially handing the Pac-12 title to USC.
Despite that, the two teams are evenly matched.
Both squads rank in the top five of the Pac-12 in hitting percentage, opponent hitting percentage, kills, assists and digs.
Even though the Bruins swept the Women of Troy in their last matchup, Haley is confident this time will be different.
“They were better organized than we were at that time,” Haley said. “I think we’re a much more patient team now, I think our lineup is solidified, I think we look comfortable.”
Senior outside hitter Alex Jupiter set the program record for kills (1,804) over last weekend against Arizona, and senior setter Kendall Bateman will look to put herself in the record books this weekend, needing only 40 assists to claim the school record.
“[Bateman] is the best, no matter what the record says,” Haley said. “With the number of three-set matches we’ve played this year, if she sets the record, that’s doubly special.”
USC travels to Westwood to play the Bruins on Friday at 5 p.m.
