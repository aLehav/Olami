Philadelphia rock band Dr. Dog has made a splash in the national music scene in recent years as it has gained increasing media exposure — and rightfully so.

With a hard work ethic, the band members are no strangers to life on the road. Supporting the release of its new album, Shame, Shame, Dr. Dog embarked on its most recent world tour, with concerts scheduled at a variety of venues from the beautiful mountains of Aspen, Colo., to the cosmopolitan city of Barcelona, Spain — all for the sake of sharing its new collection of wonderfully crafted songs.
In recording its new album, the five-piece made a big leap forward as it shook up its usual album-making process.
For the first time, the musicians decided to forgo recording in their home studio — where they crafted all five of their previous albums — and hired an outside producer to help their group take the next step in their natural evolution.
Producer Rob Schnapf — who has worked previously with Beck and Elliott Smith — helped Dr. Dog create an album full of intricate harmonies and soaring melodies that firmly establishes the band as one of today’s most promising rock outfits.
Shame, Shame — made available to listeners a week early through National Public Radio’s free online stream — doesn’t stray off too far from the gritty and timeless sound the band has come to be associated with.
With clever arrangements and detailed harmonies, the band’s exceptional songwriting places it somewhere in between the genres of indie rock and baroque pop.
While the group has drawn comparisons to The Band and the Beach Boys, the men of Dr. Dog admit that their broad influences also extend out to include ’90s lo-fi band Pavement and experimental songwriter R. Stevie Moore.
Interestingly, the new album draws up a contradiction in its tone. While the lyrical content deals with the melancholy themes of gloom and despondency, the shining harmonies and cordial piano riffs convey a sense of warmth and hope.
In the spirit of the album, bassist Toby Leaman wrote “Station,” a song that carries with it a strong sense of longing and home sickness.
“It’s the only song I’ve ever written about touring or anything like that,” Leaman said in a statement published on the band’s website. “It’s also about how my wife and I bought a place in Wilmington, Del., and it worked out great for us, but we both miss Philly. It’s also about leaving to go on tour, leaving over and over again.”
The meticulous orchestration on “Station” consists of slide guitars, delayed drums and warm harmonies yet never sounds too busy.
Instead, all the instrumental elements support the essence of the song. Capturing raw emotions, this well-crafted song is built on strong instrumental foundations. With its sluggishly cozy quality, the song sounds like a porch-side jam session on a lazy Sunday morning.
Not surprisingly, the new album finds a large source of inspiration in the band’s hometown of Philadelphia.
Guitarist Scott McMicken wrote “Shadow People” — just one of the album’s many highlights — about living in a unique West Philadelphia neighborhood full of flamboyant personalities. Overwhelmed by the extensive wackiness of the community’s characters, McMicken sings It’s the right night for the wrong company / There ain’t nothing here to look at / Move along.
“Philly has been such a big part of our lives, and I feel like on this record it finally took over and made its way into our music,” McMicken said on the website. “There’s a line that says, I stole a bike from the Second Mile and saw a band play in the basement. The Second Mile is this thrift around the corner from my house, and there’s so many basement shows in West Philly, like noisy, artsy bands.”
The brittle vocals on the track are reminiscent of Wayne Coyne’s characteristic vocal qualities on the Flaming Lips’ famous song “She Don’t Use Jelly.” Yet the playfully interweaving piano and guitar lines along with the bright vocal harmonies make the track sound distinctly unique.
While Dr. Dog has been putting out records since 1999, Shame, Shame makes it evident that it doesn’t intend to stop anytime soon.
Like a breath of fresh air, Dr. Dog’s musical sensibilities rejuvenate the listener.
In today’s mainstream rock, it’s rare to find a five-piece band for which the instrumentation complements itself without clashing.
This makes it just that much more fun to listen to Dr. Dog, a band that cleverly uses the tools it has on hand to craft compositionally thick yet catchy songs.
Thanks for this. Other than the fact that I love Dr. Dog since I too come from the Philly area, they are a great band and I’m happy to see that they’re receiving recognition across the country. =)

In last week’s The New York Times review of Dum Dum Girls’ I Will Be, which debuted March 31, the critic could not get through even the first clause of his opening sentence without labeling the shoegaze-y pop-rock outfit an “all-female” band.
Yes, the group’s name does invoke a specific gender and, yes, frontwoman Dee Dee often prefers decadently patterned tights and short shorts over the standard rocker uniform of jeans and a T-shirt for live performances.
But should the group’s fashionable good looks and its feminine name — which, by the way, pays homage to both Iggy Pop’s “Dum Dum Boys” and The Vaselines’ 1989 album Dum-Dum — imply that Dee Dee and her bandmates should be patting themselves on the back for overcoming their handicap of femininity to produce an album that can play in the big leagues alongside their male indie-rock counterparts?
This dropping of a gender distinction when discussing rock music, whether indie or mainstream, is just one of many in a field that has historically been dominated and typified by men.
Last month, the Los Angeles Times published a cover story on L.A.’s lo-fi rock scene currently flourishing at the Downtown all-ages venue The Smell. Unlike previous articles on contemporary L.A. musicians and the unassuming hole-in-the-wall venue that has quickly become an indie-rock sanctuary, the Feb. 7 article, which was sectioned into interviews with Best Coast, Pearl Harbor, Nite Jewel and the aforementioned Dum Dum Girls, was overly preoccupied with a minor quality that each musician biologically had in common.
From the title — “Queens of L.A.’s lo-fi scene” —  to the sub headline — “…a new crop of female rockers…” — to the opening sentence, which referenced nearly every “all-girl punk band” from the Go-Gos to Sleater-Kinney and the most recently defunct Mika Miko, it was apparent the Los Angeles Times believed that what was fascinating about these artists was not the music they were creating, but how they managed to play guitar and keyboards with manicured fingernails.
And even though Angeleno music advocates cannot be anything but giddy for these homegrown artists, the increasing popularity of these women is twofold — just like the ones who rose to fame before them.
The bright spotlight currently shining on these swaggering, musically inclined females converges with last month’s release of the rock ‘n’ roll biopic, The Runaways. The film, which is based off Cherie Currie’s Neon Angel: A Memoir of a Runaway and stars Kristen Stewart and Dakota Fanning, depicts, like every other rock ‘n’ roll biopic, the rise and fall of the hard-rock band that formed in Southern California in the mid 1970s.
But what makes this biopic, even if it is only mediocre at best, a standout among its celluloid peers is the The Runaways’ distinguished legacy as being the first — for lack of a less-exhausted phrase — all-female band.
The brainchild of then-teenagers Joan Jett (guitar), the late Sandy West (percussion) and iconic record producer Kim Fowley, and rounded out by Lita Ford (lead guitar), Jackie Fox (bass) and Cherie Currie (lead vocals), The Runaways catapulted to international acclaim with its self-titled debut record in 1976. But more so than its music, which was grounded in hard-edged beats, punk angst and arena-rock guitar shredding, the short-lived Runaways garnered most of its fame by its provocative image.
The Runaways’ “all-female” foundation inherently possessed a certain kind of kitsch, and Fowley, known for cultivating novelty bands, did not pass up the chance to capitalize on the group’s groundbreaking lineup.
“There’s only two places men want to see women,” Fowley says in the film, “and that’s in the kitchen or on their knees.”
The movie, too, exploits its feminine wiles to its full potential, from the opening frame of menstrual blood splashing onto already-stained concrete to the media hype of Fanning and Stewart’s racy make-out session. Although written and directed by a woman and centering around female protagonists, the film’s marketing seemed to cater to men, highlighting everything a teen male would want to see — scantily clad girls engaging in hypersexual activities.
Unfortunately, more than 30 years after a dolled-up and well-underage Currie thrust her hips into her mic stand à la David Bowie, music’s glass ceiling, though noticeably cracked, is still far from being shattered.
What’s most intriguing, however, is how these gender-specific labels abound in only particular genres of music. With the exception of “diva,”  which typically denotes a woman, rarely does one read about a “female pop star” or “female country singer.” As women remain the chart-toppers and largest money-makers in those genres, their voices will proceed to dominate the airwaves.
Yet rock ‘n’ roll, with an alpha-male image at its core, continues to function as a boys-only club, leaving the girls who would rather strap on an electric guitar than a sweet-tempered acoustic to pave their own paths.
In an early scene in The Runaways, a leather jacket-clad Jett sits in a school classroom opposite an elderly man gently strumming an acoustic guitar. She rolls her eyes as he asks her to model his fingers and play a simple G chord.
“At least teach me ‘Smoke on the Water,’” Jett begs. “I know you know that one.”
“Girls don’t play electric guitar,” he responds.
The man continues to ignore her pleas and move his fingers from a G to a D chord, expecting Jett to follow. Instead, she plugs the amplifier into her guitar, kicks back her chair and wails away, drowning her teacher’s protests in a wave of electric screeches.
To you, Joan Jett, I say — “Rock on.”

Like most fairy tales, Into The Woods begins with its characters already steeped in conflict.
The play, written by Stephen Sondheim and produced by the USC School of Theatre as part of its annual spring musical, jumps straight into action.
Ever after · The USC School of Theatre students who comprise the cast of Into the Woods embody familiar characters, including Rapunzel, Red Riding Hood and Cinderella. The play runs until April 11 in Bing Theatre. - Photo courtesy of USC School of Theatre 
The story opens with a mother explaining to her son the need for sacrifice if their family hopes to stave off starvation, a baker and his wife contending with infertility, a girl with golden curls and a red cape embarking on an ill-fated trip to visit her grandmother in the woods, and an overworked young woman enduring the unjust terms of her servitude while her cruel stepmother and stepsisters prepare for a ball.
Remarkably, this staggering amount of action is somehow orchestrated to appear as if happening almost simultaneously.
Little do these characters — including such recognizable fairy tale figures like Jack (of beanstalk fame), Red Riding Hood and Cinderella — know that their paths would cross very shortly and change the course of their lives forever.
Into The Woods takes well-known childhood fairytales and weaves them into a tangle of wants and desires through a narrative centering on the Baker and his wife on their quest to conceive.
A witch — who happens to be the Baker’s neighbor — informs the couple of a curse that she placed on the Baker’s father years earlier when he stumbled into her garden in search of some greens for his pregnant wife (he pocketed a few of her magical beans at the same time). In addition to the curse, she also took his first born child, the Baker’s sister.
The plot of the play hinges on the Baker and Wife’s quest to reverse the curse placed by the Witch on their family, a task requiring the Baker and his wife to come up with hair as yellow as corn, a cow as white as milk, a cape as red as blood and shoes of gold.
It is on this hunt that their paths cross with those of their neighbors and the characters are forced to decide how far they will each go — both physically and ethically — to achieve their deepest desires.
The all-student cast does a phenomenal job of portraying the variety of emotional struggles the characters they embody must endure through the performance.
The dark musical features grim issues, such as death, loneliness and poverty, alongside instances of humor stemming from the characters’ quick wits.
Although many of the fairy tales portrayed within the musical are immediately familiar, Into The Woods takes a fresh angle and adds sudden twists and turns that leave audiences guessing at each character’s fate until the final curtain falls.
The audience is offered a close look at each of the characters’ internal struggles in such a way as to make it almost impossible not to empathize; Into The Woods makes each story and character relatable, even the Wicked Witch.
By the story’s close, all the characters find themselves in places they never imagined, with lives they never planned. Only then are they forced to decide if the process of searching for their desires was worthwhile or if they actually had everything they always wanted in the first place.
Although each of the characters might not have found what they intended as they ventured into the woods, their wishes in one way or another were granted. They are each left with more than they began with and soon realize that no matter what their individual turmoil was, they were not alone. The characters were so intent on arriving at their destinations that they do not appreciate the journey until its end.
Like all other fairy tales, Into The Woods offers lessons that can be applied in day-to-day life. Much like the characters in the play itself, audience members might walk away with a new outlook on their own personal wants. If not, they will at least have been entertained — the performance is nothing if not deeply engaging — with a new perspective on the same bedtime stories they grew up with.
…did this “reviewer” even see the show? This has got to be the most generic article I’ve ever read. You might as well have pulled directly from a Wikipedia synopsis of the show. If you had, it might even be more personal. That cast deserves better than this.

Program Board confirmed exclusively to the Daily Trojan that this year’s Springfest lineup will be headlined by recording artist T-Pain and hip-hop duo Clipse. T-Pain, whose past recordings include collaborations with the likes of Chris Brown, Akon, Lil Wayne and Flo Rida, is perhaps best known for his trademark — some would say gratuitous — use of Auto-Tune technology. According to representatives from Program Board, the “Bartender” singer’s contract was only recently finalized.
Springfest will be held Saturday, April 10 in McCarthy Quad and will also feature performances by student musicians including sophomore Natalie Angiuli and junior Antonio Pontarelli.
I’m sorry I missed Pontarelli.  His music on his Myspace is rad.  T-Pain was horrible; no surprise there.
Antonio Pontarelli’s finale with the USC drumline. ROCKED and was the highlight of the day. I only wished that they would have played longer. Let’s bring them back next year to headline!
Joseph, you obviously haven’t seen t-pain live….believe it or not, he CAN sing WITHOUT autotune really well.  I’m actually really excited for the show.  I mean really, at least watch some youtube videos or something before you hate on him…
> I thought this was supposed
> to be a progressive university? 
Surely you’re joking.
I don’t know about the headliners, but I checked out  Antonio Pontarelli’s website and he is playing at 4:30. He is an exceptional rock violinist with an impressive list of accomplishments and he deserves the support of the USC body.! I would tell everyone that you know to show up! I haven’t heard the other USC student that is playing, Natalie Angiuli. But she deserves the USC support too! We need to promote our own artists who are probably much better than the headliners! Rock on USC!
This is the first Springfest I’m actually excited for. ALL the past few years’ headliners have been mediocre, but at least T-Pain will be mediocre and hilarious. Don’t get me wrong, I’m waiting for the day when we can get some talented acts like Miike Snow or Liars (or how about ANY electric or house music?!?), but for now, I’ll settle for “Buy You A Drink”. Shawtayeeee….
I agree with joe.
How were the artists chosen?
I thought this was supposed to be a progressive university? Instead of getting artists who put on a great liveshow or are doing unique things in music today, we’re spending mountains of money on an autotune stip club musician and two guys who haven’t put out a good record since the early 2000’s? With all of the money spent on T-Pain (who undoubtedly will suck live) you couldve gotten 5-10 other quality bands with great live shows. 
I don’t know what I’m more disappointed in, USG and the Program Board or the student body and the way our music tastes are represented…
KSCR throws a much better festival with (I’m assuming) less than a tenth of the budget.
Can non-USC students attend? If so, how much are tickets?
Springfest is free to USC students. Just show up at McCarthy Quad and have a great time!
What time does it start?
Do you need your student id or tickets?

California-born residents comprise the majority of the population of the state for the first time in more than a century, according to a USC study released last week.
According to the study, California’s percentage of foreign-born residents grew from 15.1 percent in 1980 to a peak of 27.4 percent in 2007. This number, however, is expected to decline to 26.6 percent in 2010.
Los Angeles County shows parallel trends, the study shows. Foreign-born residents grew from 22.1 percent in 1980 to 36.2 percent in 2006. But that percentage is expected to fall to 35 percent this year.
Meanwhile, the percentage of residents native to the state is projected to increase from 45.5 percent in 1980 to 54 percent in 2010. In Los Angeles, the native share is predicted to rise from 40.8 percent to 49.4 percent within the same time period.
USC professor of urban planning and demography Dowell Myers, who co-authored the the Los Angeles Times study, said the recession and stricter immigration enforcement were two key factors responsible for the change in numbers — fewer migrants are coming in and more are leaving because they can’t find work.
Gary Toebben, president of the Los Angeles Area Chamber of Commerce, told the Times that the decreased percentage of migrants to California was not surprising. The Los Angeles area alone shed a net 450,000 jobs since 2007, and the state has lost 1.5 million, he said.  Many migrants left the state and to seek jobs elsewhere.
Toebben told the Los Angeles Times that a smaller pool of potential job candidates might compel employers to eliminate pay cuts and furloughs made during the recession.
An increased percentage of native Californians could be good news for the state, several analysts said. Children born to immigrants complete more years of schooling, speak better English and earn more income than their parents, according to several studies.  Natives to the state are also three times more likely to stay in California than their migrant counterparts, Myers said.
While I was born too, here in “California” basically It is A very wonder place to live .
I perfer  to be educated in my home town, which I have grown a-custom to.

The second of six public opinion polls conducted by the USC College of Letters, Arts & Sciences and the Los Angeles Times found large shifts in attitudes among California voters regarding immigration policy and the economy, according to results released Monday.
According to Ann Crigler, chair and professor of political science, a number of students were involved in formulating questions and doing research for the poll. She said getting students involved with the project was crucial for them to understand how to do research.
“It gives them a much better understanding of how to analyze the polls they read in their daily lives, and they also think about politics in general and how to get people interested in it,” she said.
Still, the project would like to have more students involved in formulating questions and analyzing results, according to Dan Schnur, director of USC’s Jesse M. Unruh Institute of Politics, who said there will be a series of upcoming events for students interested in getting involved in the project.
“Our goal is to gradually get students more involved,” he said. “We think this will be a very unique learning experience for students interested in learning about politics and public opinion.”
The newly released poll, which surveyed 1,515 registered California voters on public policy issues such as health care and immigration reform and the 2010 gubernatorial and senate races, found that 47 percent of voters said they opposed denying illegal immigrants social services funded by taxpayer money, while 45 percent supported it.
Schnur said these results show a significant shift in voter opinion.
“Historically, California voters have opposed services to illegal immigrants and their families,” Schnur said. “We’ve seen a much higher level of support in this poll.”
Though only 10 percent of voters surveyed said the nation is headed in the right direction, many are pleased with the health care reform bill, with 52 percent saying the country will be better off now that President Barack Obama has signed the bill.
In the race for governor, one of the key points stressed was Republican candidate Meg Whitman’s business background and her fundraising ability, which representatives from USC and the Los Angeles Times agreed have led to her three-point lead over democratic candidate Jerry Brown. Whitman currently has the support of 44 percent of voters, while Brown has 41 percent. 
“The biggest weakness of a female candidate running for president or governor is being perceived as not being able to take on CEO positions and her advertising has tackled this head on,” said Linda DiVall, a republican pollster from the Los Angeles Times.
Lauren Korbatov, public relations director of the USC College Republicans, said she feels that Meg Whitman’s business background, in particular, makers her a better candidate for governor.
“I think she has a very strong chance of winning the election,” Korbatov said. “Her business experience is a huge asset because California is facing a lot of economic problems right now.”
The poll also found that voters are more confident in the nation’s economy than in California’s.
Bobby Almeida, president of the USC College Democrats, said that the pessimism in California about the economy stems from the lack of confidence in the current Republican leadership.
“That’s why we need to elect Jerry Brown,” he said. “When he was governor, California created 1.9 million new jobs, and that’s what we need in this economy.”
One of the unique features of this poll, according to Jane Junn, research director and professor of political science, is its emphasis on understanding the dynamics of swing voters — those voters registered as ‘declined to state.’
“We know that elections are won or lost based on swing voters, and to understand their dynamics we designed this poll to understand the preferences of candidates among swing voters,” Junn said.
Schnur echoed the importance of swing voters, saying that future polls will likely continue to place emphasis on them.
“We hope to continue this in other polls,” he said. “‘Declined to state’ voters are one of the fastest growing groups in California. By looking in greater detail at [these] voters, you not only get a better sense for the electorate in this year’s elections, but you get a sense of what the electorate of the future will look like.”
The College and Los Angeles Times plan to release another poll in June and three more polls before the 2010 elections for governor and Senate in November.
“found that 47 percent of voters said they opposed denying illegal immigrants social services funded by taxpayer money, while 45 percent supported it”
Schnur should have taught these students better. You don’t put double negatives and pretzel sentences in polls like that unless you’re deliberately trying to skew the answers. It’s no surprise that you found more people who “opposed denying” than past polls have found “support” spending taxpayer money on entitlements for illegals. Either Dan failed to teach the students about wording questions for objectivity, or more likely, the LA Times was deliberately teaching them how to twist the questions to get the results they want. Which is, I suppose, good training for a job in American journalism.

The Annenberg Foundation has donated $10 million to the Annenberg School for Communication & Journalism and the Keck School of Medicine to help fund scholarships for incoming students in both schools.
Big money · The Annenberg Foundation recently donated $10 million to the Annenberg School for Communication & Journalism and the Keck School of Medicine. - Tim Tran | Daily Trojan 
The Wallis Annenberg Endowed Scholarship Fund will provide scholarships of up to $35,000 to incoming Keck students and up to $25,000 to incoming Annenberg students. Scholarship recipients will be chosen based on academic merit and financial need.
Leonard Aube, executive director of the Annenberg Foundation, said Wallis Annenberg chose to make the donation because of the rising cost of higher education.
“Wallis recognizes that across higher education it has become more and more expensive, and it’s been harder and harder for families to gain access,” Aube said. “She felt compelled to want to provide and strengthen the university’s ability to provide financial resources for the students.”
According to Aube, Wallis Annenberg chose to donate to Keck because the cost of attending medical school is significant, and she wanted to ensure that a broad range of students could have access to financial support.
Keck Dean Carmen Puliafito said Keck will use this grant, which is being split evenly between the two schools, as an opportunity for the school to attract the most talented students.
“It’s going to be a tremendous help for our medical students,” Puliafito said. “We will be able to recruit outstanding candidates and give the necessary financial aid.”
Annenberg Dean Ernest Wilson said this money will also allow the Annenberg school to recruit a diverse range of outstanding candidates.
“The money is used entirely for scholarships, and we think that is so important because we want to be able to attract a student body that is economically and culturally diverse,” Wilson said. “The purposes of the grant serves the purposes of the school; the ethics and morals of the gift is to help underprivileged kids learn more about communication and journalism.”
Not only does Wilson see this gift as an opportunity for incoming students but also as recognition of the Annenberg school’s work.
“The donation means that we continue to be recognized by our supporters and stakeholders outside of the school and that we continue to do very important work in the fields of communication and journalism,” he said. “It sends a message to our faculty members, our current students, our graduates and most importantly future Annenberg students.”
Aube said he thinks there is mutual excitement for Wallis Annenberg and the future student beneficiaries of the scholarship.
“Wallis is excited that there is an opportunity here to provide resources, and it’s going to be a tremendous assistance for [students] and their academic career, so I think there is mutual excitement for them on both sides of the equation,” he said.

Because of a technical glitch that went unnoticed by administrators, book lists were not initially available on the fall 2010 schedule of classes, despite the university’s announcement that lists would be added for all courses.
The university announced in February that book lists would be available for all courses in the fall schedule of classes in compliance with a new federal law that goes into effect in July and requires all schools to publish textbook information in their course catalogues. The move, administrators said, was intended to help students monitor their textbook costs as they selected courses for the upcoming semester.
But when the schedule of classes went online in early March, the book lists were nowhere to be found.
“There was an error generated by having more than one registration term active at one time,” said Ken Servis, dean of academic records and registrar. “We had registration open for summer 2010 and fall 2010, so the system didn’t display the book lists for fall.”
Once brought to the attention of administrators, the error was fixed at noon on Monday. Since then, the lists have been accessible via a small textbook icon next to each class on the online schedule of classes. It includes each textbook’s title, ISBN and new and used prices.
Though not all students had noticed that the book lists were absent, many are glad to have the chance to view them now.
“Now that they’re there, they’re really helpful,” said Samantha Howell, a sophomore majoring in international relations and political science. “I tend to buy all my textbooks online, and the lists make that process a lot easier.”
For students, the technical error was fixed just in time: Registration for undergraduates begins at 8:30 a.m. Tuesday.
“Thankfully, nobody had registered yet, so it doesn’t really make a difference,” Servis said. “It’s the first time we’ve had two terms open for registration, which is why there was a glitch.”
Lisa Zhao, the vice chair and textbook campaign coordinator for USC’s California Public Interest Research Group said it is important that the problem was fixed in time for registration.
“Students have a right to know what textbooks they’re using and how much they will cost before they register for classes,” she said. “I’ve had to drop classes because the textbooks were so expensive, and the book lists stop that from happening.”
Though the technical glitch has been resolved, many classes are still missing their book lists. This year, teachers were required to submit their book lists by Feb. 22, six weeks earlier than the previous deadline, and Servis said many professors missed that deadline.
Zhao said she thinks it is important that all professors take the time to determine their book lists early.
“The [new] requirements also make sure professors know about the prices of their own textbooks,” she said. “A lot of the time they don’t know how expensive their textbooks are. Hopefully now they’ll be more conscious.”
Aside from costs, the textbooks help students decide on classes based on their academic interests.
“It definitely helps a lot of people choose which classes they’re going to take,” Zhao said. “Students need to have a good overview of how many books they’re going to read and whether they’re interested in those books. If they’re deciding between two classes, a list of material helps weigh out which to take.”

The rainy weather in the Bay Area last weekend proved to be an unavoidable obstacle for the USC women’s tennis team.
First, the No. 18 Women of Troy (11-7, 3-1) headed to Palo Alto, Calif., to take on No. 12 Stanford (14-1, 3-0) on Friday. Because of the threat of rain, Stanford and USC agreed to play singles before doubles, but only five of the six matches managed to finish even a single game in the first set before the rain poured down.
Long weekend · Junior Maria Sanchez’s nine-game singles match winning streak was ended this weekend when she lost to California’s Jana Juricova in three tough sets. - Geo Tu | Daily Trojan 
With more rain forecasted, the match was postponed to Sunday. Stanford and USC were also previously rained out on Feb. 27 in Los Angeles in a Pac-10 exhibition match.
On Sunday morning, the match resumed though risk of rain persisted.  Again, the teams began with singles play. Stanford picked up two quick wins on courts four and six, as USC junior Lyndsay Kinstler fell 6-1, 6-1, and USC freshman Valeria Pulido lost 6-1, 6-3.
But the Women of Troy were quick to tie it back up 2-2, posting wins from both sophomore Alison Ramos and freshman Danielle Lao in three-set matches. No. 26 Ramos upended her Stanford opponent, No. 61 Lindsay Burdette, 6-3, 6-3. Meanwhile, No. 30 Lao had a little more trouble taking down No. 69 Stacey Tan of Stanford. Lao lost the first set 4-6 but came back to finish off Tan in the next two sets, 6-1, 6-4.
Stanford retaliated with a victory on court five, putting Stanford back in the lead 3-2. This left the match in the hands of Stanford’s                No. 8 Hilary Barte and USC’s No. 2 junior Maria Sanchez at the top court.
Sanchez took the first set 6-3, but Barte didn’t stop without a hard-fought battle, getting the second set over Sanchez 6-4. During their third set, the rain began to fall again, forcing the match indoors. In the end, it was Sanchez who had the last word. She triumphed over four match points, racking in a tough third-set win in a tiebreaker 8-6.
“It took mental toughness, skill and heart to win that match. We are all very proud of her,” Ramos said of Sanchez’s win.
This left the match even at 3-3, as the rain caused the doubles matches to be suspended. The doubles action will be resumed at the           Pac-10 championships in Ojai, Calif., on April 22, but only if the result is needed to decide the      Pac-10 conference champion.
Sanchez said she was disappointed that she couldn’t continue play.
“I was hoping to play the doubles point since I definitely felt like we had the momentum going,” she said.
Ramos also agreed with Sanchez, as she had hoped her team could break Stanford’s 159-match winning streak at home.
“It is a little frustrating we couldn’t finish the match and that there is no winner or loser,” Ramos said. “It’s an odd feeling to tell other people that we’re tied.”
The Women of Troy felt their performance against the Cardinal was a good indication of how good they can actually be.
“It was invigorating to tie it back up,” Lao said. “We had our top three players beat their top three, which shows the potential that we have. Now we just need to get to a point where we can all perform well on the same day to clinch a big win.”
The day before continuing the match with Stanford, USC faced       No. 12 Cal (14-4, 2-1). Though the weather was clear, USC couldn’t pull off the upset and lost to the Bears 5-2.
After doubles and four singles matches, Cal gained control of the match 3-2. The deciding singles matches both ended with close three-setters in Cal’s favor.
Cal’s No. 3 Jana Juricova ended Sanchez’s nine-game winning streak in a three-set match, 6-3, 5-7, 6-3. The two had previously dueled in another three-setter in February at Marks Stadium, where Sanchez handed Juricova one of her few losses of the season.
The Bears continued to power through even though they already clinched the match. Ramos struggled to finish off Cal’s No. 44 Mari Andersson on court two. Ramos took the first set but fell in the second, 3-6. With the final set knotted at four-all, Andersson held serve to go up 5-4 and then broke Ramos for a 6-4 win. Andersson managed the comeback to wrap up the Bears’ second 5-2 decision over USC this season.
“It’s difficult to tell whether we will play the point against Stanford considering our chances of winning the Pac-10 team title,” Ramos said. “In order for us to win the title, we must remain undefeated for the rest of the matches and we must count on other teams to lose.”
USC will play Arizona State and Arizona at home this weekend.

Robert Farah and Steve Johnson continued to rack up wins and accolades Sunday in La Jolla, Calif.
The No. 8 senior and sophomore duo participated in the 121st Pacific Coast Doubles Championships — the second-oldest tennis event in the United States — and took home a trophy bearing the names of tennis greats Arthur Ashe and John McEnroe, as well as current USC coaches Peter Smith and Eric Amend.
Accolades · Senior Robert Farah and sophomore Steve Johnson used their extra time in Northern California to play in the USTA event. - Geo Tu | Daily Trojan 
Following two impressive conference victories against California and Stanford on Friday and Saturday, Farah and Johnson played in the USTA-organized event, where anyone — not just collegiate players — can participate.
“It’s different for us to be in an open tournament and just playing doubles,” Smith said. “There are very few tournaments with just doubles.”
In addition to featuring athletes from all levels, the matches were decided in a best-of-three-set format as opposed to the typical eight-game pro set used in dual matches.
“The format is different, but that doesn’t make a difference,” Farah said. “[Johnson] and I are used to the format from all of our years of playing tennis.”
The players played in a more relaxed environment, outside of the tension-filled dual-match season.
“Every match has its own brand of pressure,” Smith said. “There is a lot of pressure as a USC player, but there is no pressure in the Pacific Coast tournament, just carefree play.”
After being postponed because of rain, the semifinals and finals were played out Sunday.
In the day’s first match, the second-seeded Trojan team overcame the comeback effort of top-seeded Brent Davis and Jeffrey G. Tarango to win 6-2, 4-6, 6-4.
That victory set up a rematch against the Stanford’s No. 1 team of sophomores Bradley Klahn and Ryan Thacher.
On Friday, during the Stanford match at Marks Stadium, Farah and Johnson defeated Klahn and Thacher 8-3.
The USC duo repeated its earlier result with a 6-3, 6-2 victory over the Cardinal duo to join the ranks of Pacific Coast doubles champions.
“[This was a] big confidence boost for [Farah] and myself,” said Johnson of beating Klahn and Thacher twice during the weekend. “We have put in a lot of hard work, and we are playing really well together. We have been returning well and playing really smart.”
Tarango, a former ATP pro, is a huge win.  Also, the caption of the photo is wrong.  La Jolla is near San Diego – in Southern California, not Nor Cal.

The comparison began the minute running back Joe McKnight committed to play football for USC rather than homestate Louisiana State University in 2007.
He was going to be the next Reggie Bush.
Bush, who declared for the NFL draft in 2006, left a legacy at USC after winning the Heisman Trophy in 2005 and cementing his place as one of the best running backs the Trojans have ever seen grace the Coliseum.
His 2005 rushing numbers: 1,740 yards, 16 touchdowns and an average of 8.7 yards per carry.
His 2005 receiving numbers: 37 receptions for 478 yards, two touchdowns and an average of 12.9 yards per reception.
And after returning one punt for a touchdown early in the season, Bush simply didn’t receive many more punts to return. Opposing teams opted to kick the ball out of bounds rather than deal with the superstar who had skills that made five-star recruits look like they were playing the wrong sport.
Bush’s final line was staggering, and he rightfully took home the Heisman Trophy following his junior campaign.
Then, like many expected, he turned pro.
USC was left without the flair and excitement that Bush provided when the Trojans played the 2006 season, but 2007 was to be different.
Joe McKnight was to be the new man.
The new Bush.
But he never was.
McKnight showed glimpses of greatness at times, but he battled injury problems throughout his stay in the Cardinal and Gold, and he never did seem to grasp the concept of holding onto the ball all that well.
Only after declaring for the NFL draft after the 2009 season did McKnight state that the lofty expectations placed on him to be the next Reggie Bush negatively affected his play on the field.
“I could have been better,” he said.
“That’s what my biggest problem was, trying to be so much like [Bush], instead of just being Joe McKnight and playing Joe McKnight football,” he added.
McKnight’s most recent season, his best at USC, ended with 1,014 rushing yards, eight rushing touchdowns and an average of 6.2 yards per carry. He also caught 22 passes for 146 yards, but didn’t score a single receiving touchdown.
Those stats are very un-Bushian.
So now, the question still remains.
Who is the “next Reggie Bush?”
That may be impossible to answer. Maybe, just like the NBA question of who is the next Michael Jordan, there is no one that can fill Bush’s cleats.
Maybe Trojan football will never see another star juke, jump and, yes, even push like Bush did during his time at USC.
Or maybe, just maybe, the next Bush has arrived.
Lane Kiffin seems to believe in the latter.
The new USC head coach has compared new freshman running back Dillon Baxter to none other than No. 5 himself.
And unlike McKnight, Baxter, who graduated early from high school so he could enroll at USC in January and participate in spring practice, likes the comparison.
“It’s an honor to be compared to Reggie Bush,” the 19-year-old said.
Just like Bush, Baxter hails from San Diego and possesses the quick, make-you-miss moves that Bush had in college.
Nothing can be proven until the season begins and Baxter shows what he can contribute as a Trojan, but early in spring practice Baxter is being used at a number of different positions, similar to Bush. Baxter has seen time at running back, receiver and even quarterback on the field.
“Hopefully, I’ll get all these positions down,” Baxter said. “I’m not sure where I’ll be playing. They’re going to move me around once I get all the running back plays down.”
At Mission Bay High School, Baxter impressed recruits by not only rushing for 2,974 yards but also throwing for 1,922 yards as quarterback.
Those are skills even Bush didn’t bring with him to the college level.
Baxter has all the potential to make the big plays with his arm and legs.
Maybe it’s time to dust off No. 5’s old cleats. We might have a perfect fit.

Although snow and freezing temperatures are not characteristic of Los Angeles, the warm climate presents no challenge for students who desire to ski.
Airborne · USC Ski and Snowboard club member Abe Kislevitz, who graduated from USC in 2009, created the club’s website on which followers can watch club-produced videos and keep up with the team. - Photo courtesy of Nicole Kucera 
Every weekend about 30 to 40 members of the USC Ski and Snowboard club travel to Mammoth Mountain to hit the slopes.
Club President and ski club coach senior Chris Nelson, heads a group of 107 members that has been making a name for itself. The USC freestyle ski team, which is a part of the club, competed in its first nationals last year and won the event. It then narrowly defeated University of Colorado at Boulder to defend its national championship title March 6.
The USC freestyle ski team is composed of Nelson, along with juniors Ben Gunton, Chris Farro, Caleb Farro and freshman Matt Cook, who all traveled to Sunday River, Maine for the five-day competition.
With more than 500 competitors at nationals, the USC freestyle ski team made its mark in the freestyle skiing competition — that includes slope style, half pipe and skier cross, by sweeping the event. Junior Caleb Farro, placed first overall in freestyle skiing, followed by Cook in second place and Gunton in third.
Because he tore his anterior cruciate ligament and broke his wrist last year, Caleb Farro was only planning to support the team and have fun skiing at the competition. Without much preparation for nationals, he still claimed first place.
“I was stoked to be back. But my doctor doesn’t even know I’m skiing right now. I’m definitely not cleared,” he said.
Along with Caleb Farro, Cook was able to set the stage for the USC ski team when he won the half pipe during the opening ceremony.
“[Cook] was the only kid from USC to make the finals, and he went against five kids from Colorado,” Chris Farro said. “When he won, we all went nuts.”
According to Nelson, Cook’s win was crucial to prove that, despite being from sunny Los Angeles, the USC ski team was legitimate competition.
“A lot of people don’t associate SoCal with skiing, and this entire competition was a way to show more people what we’re all about,” Gunton said.
Not only did the USC ski team prove that it belongs among the top ski teams in the nation, but it also did so funding.
“Most schools like University of California at Santa Barbara sent their teams to Maine, but we had to pay $4,400 out of pocket,” Caleb Farro said.
The Recreation Club Council at USC provided the ski club with $3,000, and clubs can also earn up to an additional $1,000 if they present the RCC with a valid reason for why they need the funds.
“After winning nationals in Boulder last year, we thought we could get some more funding, but [RCC] only gave us an extra $375, which was kind of like a slap in the face,” Nelson said.
According to Chris Farro, not many students even know that the ski team competed at nationals, let alone won nationals two years in a row.
Chris Farro and Cook, however, chose to attend USC over schools like University of Colorado at Boulder specifically because of the ski club’s website.
Abe Kislevitz, a fall 2009 graduate, created the team website, USCSnowSports.org, four years ago to highlight the club’s activities.
“I wanted to get people to realize what we’re doing in Los Angeles and get the word out about our ski team winning,” Kislevitz said.
The highly interactive website has videos of the team, including a recently created 3-D video. Last year, these videos had 250,000 views on YouTube and 187,000 views since January 2010 alone.
“A lot of kids from the East Coast even follow our videos,” Kislevitz said. “I’ve had people come up to me and tell me that they’ve seen the videos and want to come to USC to ski on our team.”
For the ski club, it’s not the weather that presents the obstacle; it’s demonstrating to the public that Southern California schools can shred.
It’s about time the ski team got a little publicity!!! The videos on the website (uscsnowsports.org) are mind blowing considering that none of these guys are sponsored. You would think that double back flips and such would get you some flow… Check it out!

When I came to USC as a freshman, I was overwhelmed by how different it was from my home in Mumbai. In order not to seem out of place, I tried adopting a new lingo and way of life; I even tried altering my accent for it to sound more “Americanized.” Today, I can’t help but think how much easier things would have been if I had had someone to help me during that time.

USC has enrolled more international students than any other university in the United States. According to statistics presented by USC’s Office of International Services, an impressive 5,919 international students were enrolled in USC in the 2008-2009 academic year. Moreover, international students make up nearly 9 percent of the total undergraduate student population.
Yet, USC does fairly little to ensure a smooth transition for these students into a new culture.
According to the OIS website, the International Student Orientation, an orientation program for incoming international freshmen, promises to “acquaint new international students with USC [and] help students become more comfortable with the Los Angeles area and U.S. culture.”
During my orientation, the only way that the program aimed to help students “become more comfortable with U.S. culture” was a 20-minute PowerPoint presentation about culture shock.
Yes, acclimating to culinary differences, facing prejudices and dealing with unfamiliar cultural standards are some of the many challenges that incoming students inevitably face as a result of moving to a foreign country.
However, psychological adjustments, such as loneliness, loss of identity and homesickness, are also significant issues that international students often have to deal with.
“It was so hard to see others’ parents coming to USC for Parents Weekend, while mine were so far away,” said Gita Advani, a sophomore majoring in business administration and accounting from Singapore.
Although the staff of Office of International Services does offer assistance with issues related to personal and academic concerns, many students choose not to take advantage of this largely because of the fact that they find it uncomfortable or unnecessary to approach a staff member with their personal problems.
“I go to the Office of International Services only when I need to get a signature before traveling,” said Sahil Khandwala, a sophomore majoring in business administration (international relations) from Mumbai.
An integrated international student mentor program that pairs each incoming international student with a student mentor of the same nationality or field of study would be ideal in aiding this transition. Mentors and mentees could share their individual experiences, address academic, cultural and social concerns, and, most importantly, form a lasting bond of friendship.
USC offers a number of mentor programs for specific groups, including programs like the LGBT Peer Mentoring Program for gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender students and the Marshall Connections Program for incoming Marshall students. However, USC lacks a specialized mentor program for incoming international students.
To provide a positive experience for these students and ensure that the benefits of having a diverse student population are reaped, USC must offer support to international students through a strong mentor program.
Who better to provide this support than our fellow Trojans?
Amrita Parekh is a sophomore majoring in communication and psychology.
Amrita, well written article. But why would you expect USC to be the same as Mumbai. I am an international student too. I was late and missed the orientation. Heck! I didn’t even know where the Registration Building was. I just asked other students and got around. I only needed help with the immigration matters.
I think international students should venture out , join some volunteer group make friends. The best orientation you can get is from friends and your seniors.
I thought the Parkside residences were intended to create a community among/with international students.  How is that working out?
Are there any events geared towards international students (as a whole, not just by specific nationality/ethnicity/region)?  I recall the I-House at Cal regulary put on events; that seemed to create a sense of community among the international students.
Amrita, you obviously communicate in English well. But other international students who come from countries in which they’re not immersed in English, that is, the British didn’t colonize their countries, got a much harder time adjusting. Count your blessings.
Yes, I know it’s unrealistic and thoughtless for USC to try to acclimate you to Angelino/U.S. culture with a cursory and brisk “20-minute PowerPoint presentation about culture shock.”
USC is just trying to add to the “international student admission” numbers so to raise its academic prestige. It’s a silly game USC is playing without regard to the psychological ramifications of students like you who still feel like something is lacking.
wtf do you mean by count your blessings? Should we be glad that the British colonized us?

If you think soft money is the dollar bill you dropped in the pool and a stock portfolio is a fancy folder, you’re not alone.
Many college students don’t have the kind of personal finance savvy to guide them to a debt-free life.
Knowing how to spend, earn and save money is as essential to American life as sharing, caring and having social skills — so why doesn’t every high school graduate in the United States know what a mortgage is?
Hye You | Daily Trojan
In the midst of a financial crisis where jobs come far and few between, money — and the skills to maximize its use — is the key to creating a generation that can weather the difficult economic recovery we are currently experiencing.
College students are at a crucial time in their lives where they develop the spending and budgeting skills for their adult lives. They often depend on credit cards and student loans, which they might not understand, to get them through school.
Some students can only attribute their knowledge about personal finance to experiences growing up.
It’s normal for students like Alana Muntz, a freshman majoring in political science, to not be completely familiar with terms like “credit score.” She attributed most of what she knew about spending money to her parents.
“My parents gave me an allowance and taught me how to divide it into savings, spending and charity to give to church,” Muntz said.
She also has a credit card.
“My mom set it up for me,” she said. “It’s to establish credit, or something like that.”
Upon applying for a credit card, all the introductory literature spews terms like “APR,” “average daily balance method,” “credit line” — terms not taught in school. It’s up to the individual to care enough to read and truly understand the fine print.
It seems that only certain students like Andy Matsuzaki, a junior majoring in economics, bother to look up what those terms mean.
“You have to have an interest in personal finance,” he said. “I spent time hanging around Barnes & Noble reading up … it was time-consuming and difficult, but I saw the benefits.”
Matsuzaki credited his peers’ poor spending habits to short-term thinking.
“Students don’t have a lot of money in the first place … it doesn’t hit them until it’s overwhelming,” he said.
Short of personal interest and research, however, some students recognize that financial intelligence should have a place in higher education. The fact remains that personal finance should not be an optional pursuit but something all college students should be well versed in.
Caitlin Price, a junior majoring in business administration and accounting, chose to help coordinate a series of personal finance workshops in conjunction with the USC Marshall Partners, an academic support group.
“The major areas we wanted to focus on make or break someone in the finance world,” Price said.
Featuring sessions on housing, budgeting, investing and taxes, the series includes an hour-long program where professionals speak about these intimidating but practical subjects.
Price, whose father works in private equity and mother serves as a brand manager, grew up with a business-oriented mind. She held a full-time job every summer, starting in the sixth grade. After years of hard work, she bought her own car — and now takes full responsibility for her financial life as an aspiring investment banker.
“[Students] need to be educated on finance topics,” she said. “They need to be proactive in their own financial lives.”
Price pinpointed five basic tenets that young spenders should follow. Not only should they know how to manage a budget and what impacts their credit score but also how to do their taxes, understand the true value of money and acknowledge that they are not in a vacuum.
“Students don’t recognize that things like the health care bill will impact them financially,” Price said.
At the end of the day, it is up to us to take responsibility and educate themselves. There’s certainly not a lack of resources.
Sure, the personal finance section of the library may seem dry and dense, but small steps, like reading the Wall Street Journal, looking out for free workshops provided by Marshall, actually reading the cheesy brochures that explain financial concepts at local banks and employing resources such as the Internet, can enable students to take a more active role in their own practical lives — beyond dropping loose change into a piggy bank.
After all, one can never really know when the next rainy day — or recession — will occur.

USC sophomore Jennifer Song, who has been looking to use her USC career as a springboard to the professional ranks, had a strong showing over the weekend at the Kraft Nabisco Championship — the LPGA’s first major tournament of the 2010 season.
Song finished 21st overall against a challenging field with a score of 1-over 289 (71-71-76-71) — ahead of the highly-touted young phenom Michelle Wie who finished 27th overall.
Competing as an amateur, she also earned low-amateur honors to the surprise of very few.
“She just knows how to grind,” Andrea Gaston, the team coach at USC, told Southland Golf Magazine following Song’s solid outing. “I think her game is suited for very difficult golf courses because she has the mental toughness to stay in the game. She doesn’t let anything really get to her.”
The sophomore’s strong finish was largely due to an impressive performance early on in the four-day tournament. As of Friday night, with the first two days in the books, Song was tied for 10th overall after posting a score of 2-under 142 (71-71), positioning herself toward the top of the competition.
It now appears Song will be making the jump to the professional ranks rather shortly. Earlier this year, Song announced that she’ll turn professional following June’s Curtis Cup Match, a biennial women’s amateur tournament between the United States, Great Britan and Ireland.
“I’m definitely excited to be a professional player because that’s what I want,” she told the media.

Apple products never fail to draw crowds on their release dates. The iPad was no exception: More than 300,000 iPads were purchased Saturday through in-store transactions and pre-ordering.
In addition, more than 1,000,000 applications and 250,000 electronic books were also purchased off iTunes. Apple also helped promote their product by offering downloads of more than 30,000 free e-books.
Because of the iPad’s size, certain applications are more enjoyable than on any of Apple’s previous iPod products. Imagine games, movies and television on a larger screen.
Keynote, Pages and Numbers from Apple’s iWork suite are also available in Application form allowing users to work on slideshows, spreadsheets and word-processor documents on the go.
It will be interesting to see the long-term effects of the iPad on the economy. How will this product affect the publishing industry, bookstores, journalists and authors?
A USC professor recently made a good point about the advent of the iPad: He said that the majority of the features offered on the iPad were already available on multiple other pieces of Apple hardware he already owns.
Is the ability to fit books, papers and comics into one (somewhat) manageably sized piece of equipment worth the $499 price tag?
Will students soon be carrying their iPads and Kindles to class instead of a collection of bulky textbooks? If so, how would this have an effect on our Student Bookstore?
As much as I adore my three iPods, Macbook and iPhone, I can’t say that I am going to rush off to purchase the iPad, but I won’t rule it out as a future investment. I’m sure within the next 12 months the second generation will be out anyways: Why not wait?
