America is in the midst of breaking away from an overly stylized sound, distasteful rap lyrics and pretty faces with flawed voices, to well-versed musicians with breathtaking harmonies and raw yet catchy sounds – the United States is facing another British Invasion.
Musical artists and bands like Adele, Florence and the Machine, Mumford & Sons, Muse and Radiohead have dominated multiple Billboard charts, headlined countless music festivals and even weaved their way into various American movie soundtracks.
These acts have opened up a new arena for British bands, enabling them to play concerts and radio shows, and to attract new audiences.
BBC, Britscene, About.com, and Time magazine listed multiple new British artists — most of them only in their twenties — to watch out for in 2011. Each of these artists and bands is taking music to new heights by bringing powerful vocals and eclectic arrangements that resonate with listeners.
Ed Sheeran
Ed Sheeran resembles a light hearted Joshua Radin with his youthful sweet voice, calm acoustic guitar and charming lyrics in his single “The A Team,” which charted No. 3 in the United Kingdom.
Sheeran first gained recognition with Jamie Foxx and through multiple videos on YouTube. He is releasing his first album with Atlantic Records on Sept. 12.
Jai Paul
Jai Paul, another young talent, is a complexity of falsetto harmonies, throbbing bass and warped synthesizers.  His debut single “BTSTU” peaked as a sample in Drake’s “Dreams Money Can Buy,” and recent rumors of an album have been stemming since Jai Paul released a preview of one of his songs, “Baby Beat.”
James Blake
James Blake appears to be a combination of Paul and Sheeran, but he distinguishes himself beyond his high Justin Vernon-esque vocals and disjointed beats by including elements of dubstep.
He was initially recognized for his cover of Feist’s “Limit to Your Love,” and has only shown more depth through his late winter album James Blake, which characterizes more of his strange, enticing sound.
Laura Marling
Laura Marling, originally part of the British indie band Noah and the Whale, has gone solo. Her strong, mature voice combined with folky accompaniments, low rattling guitar plucks and the occasional banjo in “Rambling Man” and “Devil’s Spoke” from her second album I Speak Because I Can demonstrate her sultry intrigue and talent.
Marling is releasing another album, A Creature I Don’t Know, on Sept. 13, which is sure to showcase more of this young artist’s brilliant work.
Smoke Fairies
Smoke Fairies, created by Katherine Blamire and Jessica Davies, epitomizes the talented female musicians rising up in Britain.
The pair was established when they were just preteens, gaining recognition by forcing Jack White (lead singer of The White Stripes) to listen to their single in a bar. White was impressed, and Smoke Fairies has since been able to debut in
larger venues such as the iTunes festival in London.
 
Be sure to check out the group’s 2011 summer album, Through Low Light and Trees, which provides captivating eerie blends of echoing harmonies with light guitar strings.
The Joy Formidable
The Joy Formidable, established in 2007, has gained recent popularity with its spring album The Big Roar. The group re-released one of its earlier singles “Whirring,” causing the album to become a booming success.
Lead singer Ritzy Bryan sounds like an older Tegan and Sara, and her soft, raw voice is illuminated with driving beats and catchy background vocals.
 
Tribes
Although Tribes is still only a Myspace band, it has released an EP, We Were Children, and the band just announced its fall 2011 tour, which is unfortunately only in the UK so far.
YUCK
Yuck released an album earlier this year as well, titled Yuck. Both of these bands’ albums beckon Nirvana fans who are nostalgic for Kurt Cobain’s gritty grumbles and garage band instrumentals, yet also want driving songs that have an upbeat kick.
 
The always-shocking Lady Gaga, pop diva Britney Spears and auto-tune master Lil Wayne better start combining forces or creating new material because the rich melodic female vocalists, genre mixing young males and grungy bands of England are starting to trump the U.S. charts and will ultimately become the new music scene in America.

Nearly every art lover dreams of one day traveling to a different country to witness amazing pieces. But the art lover in you doesn’t have to leave Los Angeles to witness great art from different cultures.
Artsy lights · Chris Burden’s “Urban Light” has become a visitor-favorite at LACMA and proves to be a rewarding art experience coupled with LACMA’s various foreign exhibits, like “Art of the Pacific.” - Photo courtesy of LACMA
A few museums in Los Angeles allow you to widen your aesthetic awareness and learn about different cultures without having to buy a plane ticket.
LACMA 
Only a stone’s throw away from the posh outdoor mall The Grove, LACMA houses a considerable amount of art from different cultures.
The Pavilion for Japanese Art takes you on a trip down a spiraling pathway where, by the end, you’ve seen artwork, armor, sculpture and ceramics all the way from 3000 B.C. to the 2000s.
One of LACMA’s newest additions is the collection “Gifts of the Sultan: The Arts of Giving at the Islamic Court,” which boasts 200 works of art, some even dating back to the eighth century.
The collection also contains the Ardabil Carpet, a breathtakingly intricate Iranian rug — one of two made back in the 1530s.
“Art of the Pacific” takes you to yet another world with its holdings of Polynesian and Melanesian objects, from an impressive drum collection to masks and statues. The museum also boasts a collection of Latin American Art and an exhibition from Californian Tim Burton.
LACMA is open every day except Wednesday, until 8 p.m. Bring your ID and pay only $10 for admission, with the exclusion of the Tim Burton exhibition. After your visit, stop by Chris Burden’s “Urban Light,” the fascinating sculpture made of street lamps, to take that iconic L.A. photo you’ve always wanted.
 
LACMA is located on 5905 Wilshire Blvd.
Japanese American National Museum 
If the Japanese art at LACMA left you thirsting for more contemporary Japanese work, you can visit the Japanese American National Museum in Little Tokyo. Not only is the museum an ideal location for learning about Japanese American history, but it also offers artwork by Japanese artists.
“Kip Fulbeck: part asian, 100% hapa” is a series of photographs of people who are Hapa — half Asian or Pacific — taken by artist Kip Fulbeck. The exhibition shows portraits along with writings of the subjects, which probe into the meaning of identity and race.
For the comic book and animation lover in you, the museum also houses a collection of work by Stan Sakai, the genius behind the samurai rabbit cartoon figure Usagi Yojimbo. The collection not only contains artwork, but also comic book art, toys and even a short documentary on the cartoon creator.
The museum is open Tuesday through Saturday from 11 a.m. to 5 p.m. and Thursday from 12 to 8 p.m. Students with ID pay $5 and entrance is free Thursdays from 5 to 8 p.m. and every third Thursday of the month. Luckily, there are plenty of sushi places nearby if all this artwork gets you hungry.
 
The JANM is located on 369 East First St.
Chinese American Museum 
Downtown Los Angeles houses a good number of hidden art places waiting to be discovered. Similar to the JANM, the Chinese American Museum downtown offers a comprehensive history of culture but also feeds your hunger for some art.
The museum houses artifacts dating from the early 1900s but also fuses the past with the present with its newest exhibition “Dreams Deferred: Artists Respond to Immigration.”
An exploratory collection that crosses a variety of mediums, this exhibition tackles the issue of immigration to America and the struggles involved.
The graffiti art, sculptures, multimedia works and more are created by local artists and present a wide range of cultural background with works from artists like Guatemalan graffiti artist Cache and the American iconic street artist Shepard Fairey.
You’ll be able to see not only their reactions to immigration issues at hand today, but also the aesthetic abilities that have garnered these artists fame so far.
The museum is open Tuesday through Sunday from 10 a.m. to 3 p.m. and students with ID get in for only $2. Walk or drive over to the nearby historic Placita Olvera and choose from a variety of Mexican restaurants and maybe even try a chocolate-filled churro.
 
The Chinese American Museum is located on 425 N. Los Angeles St.

Los Angeles is a hub of international food, culture, religion and, of course, fashion. The city boasts trending fashions from countries all across the world, including India, China, Paris and even our own uniquely American designs — so you can find clothes to fit your style no matter where you’re from. You just have to know where to look.
Jade alert · Bohemian Crystal, on Maple Avenue, is home to droves of beads and jewelry, most of which are made in China. Here you can get everything from jade beads to wooden and seashell necklaces. - Laura Cueva | Daily Trojan
Looking for amazing Indian harem pants or tunics? There’s no better place for unique and authentic international wardrobe than Los Angeles’ Fashion District. Few shops sell authentic international fashions, but the ones that do sell them at a complete steal.
Style in Fashion, an importer and distributor of Indian fabrics and clothing, sells some of the most magnificent and ornate Indian fashions around. Located on Olympic Boulevard in the heart of the Fashion District, bright colors and patterns adorn the walls in the forms of dresses, tunics, skirts and tops.
Some are impressively complex: pastels, some featured with intricate designs stitched into the fabric and accessorized with beads and dangles. Others are more simply designed but equally beautiful, like all-white tunics with smaller,
crocheted embellishments.
Once you’ve found an outfit, walk down Olympic Boulevard to Maple Avenue to Bohemian Crystal, a bead shop with imaginative accessories. Nearly every piece of jewelry is made in China, adding a unique Asian flare to the necklaces, bracelets, earrings and headwear.
From jade bead pieces to wooden and seashell necklaces, you can customize your jewelry or buy it straight off the rack, making this a one-stop-shop for everything pretty, lovely and bead-dazzled.
For something a little more authentically Asian, try Los Angeles’ Chinatown or Little Tokyo. These are centers for their respective fashions: Chinatown has the Saigon Plaza, in the Chinatown Plaza, and Dynasty Center; and Little Tokyo has the Japanese Village Plaza, all of which offer fantastic deals on imported fashion.
You can find embroidered silk dresses in most of the shops in Chinatown. The craft and handiwork that goes into making these pieces is often worth the hundred-dollar price tag. Cheaper dresses can be found, but you can also haggle with storeowners and get them to drop the price significantly.
Similar to the Downtown Fashion District, Chinese-inspired tops and wraps hang from shop walls and dress mannequins, so you can quickly see the styles and ask for the ones that most catch your eye.
Knitted caps, which are very in right now, are often hidden in the racks in Chinatown shops. Though it takes a dedicated shopper to find them, chances are you’ll be wearing them out of the store.
Little Tokyo’s Japanese Village Plaza is much less hectic and just as worthwhile. Customers aren’t allowed to touch the delicate kimonos in most of the shops, but if you ask, a clerk will show you his most popular pieces and how to wear them correctly.
You can find Japanese make-up kits, jewelry and other accessories in the plaza as well, and even a select number of American-style (think Forever 21) blouses, bottoms and summer dresses, imported directly from Japan.
If you’re just looking for random styles with no particular country in mind, the Fashion District is probably your best bet. Walk one block and you’ll stumble upon everything from African-style animal and safari print specialty stands to Hawaiian and tropical wear shops.
Of course, if you don’t have the stamina to withstand a hunt through the Downtown fashion alleys, you can always go to Forever 21 at The Grove. They’re fully stocked with Bohemian tops and dresses, Mexican style embroidered tops and hippie skirts for every girl’s taste. And you may just see a celebrity while you’re there.

The expression “as American as apple pie” is used in the United States with a certain tinge of pride. Apple pie defines anything typically American, despite the fact that it might not entirely be a product of America.
Fork deeper into the history of apple pie, and you’ll find that the apple pie reflects the essence of American culture. When the first colonists arrived, America didn’t even have the apples that we now pick at orchards or pay a ridiculous amount for at Seeds marketplace. The only native apples available were crab apples, a wild breed with a “puckerful” tartness, not ideal for dessert pies, so colonists brought apple seeds over to grow their own orchards.
Take a stroll through the city streets now, and you can see the same “apple pie” phenomenon still happening between ethnic enclaves. Or, better yet, taste the different “apple pies” across the city baked according to ethnic preferences.
They might not be inspired by “American” apple pies, but that’s just how the United States and apple pies are anyway. Nobody knows who created the world’s first apple pie, just as nobody knows the exact definition of a “true American,” because Americans come from all sorts of backgrounds. So why not enjoy and celebrate them all?
Take empanadas: small, stuffed and crimped pastry pockets that have origins in Spain and Portugal (and perhaps even the Arabian Peninsula), popularized in the United States by immigrants from various regions of Latin America. These mini, portable pies have a flaky, triangular-shaped exterior and are usually stuffed with savories like meats and cheeses. But at Argentinian Empanadas, in West Los Angeles, they are also available with an apple filling similar to that in apple pie. Superior Grocers at the University Village also sells these apple empanadas in its bakery section.
In Koreatown, apple pie takes the form of a flaky, puffy pastry. The sweetness tends to be mellow. Paris Baguette in Koreatown (also a popular bakery chain in Korea) sells them as a crunchy, buttery package, enveloping a sticky, chunky apple filling that has more tart and less spice than traditional American apple pies.
At any Korean grocery store (the closest is Han Nam Chain store on Olympic Boulevard), you can also find boxes of “apple pie” in the snack section with individually packaged strips of puff pastry, crowned with a slick of shiny apple jam. Don’t expect anything revolutionary — they are, after all, prepackaged goods — but it’s still an interesting look at what kinds of tastes Koreans prefer in apple pie.
The quintessential American pie route, however, might be the fried apple pies served at McDonald’s, even if food snobs and health nuts will scoff at the blasphemy of it. The McDonald’s in the United States no longer serves apple pie fried, but elsewhere across the world, from Hong Kong to Singapore to Mexico, good ol’ pies fried by the whole are still served.
You can get a pricier and fancier fried apple pie at Luna Park near Wilshire. Its glorious pie is served drizzled with caramel sauce and oozing with slowly melting caramel ice cream, good enough to satisfy the infamous American sweet tooth and make any dentist howl.
So is there such a thing as an “American” food? Other typical American foods, such as pizza and hotdogs, also have origins in other cultures, although Italians and Germans would have a hard time accepting our New York-style delivery pizza and mustard-and-relish-topped ballpark hotdogs have any roots in Naples pizza and bratwurst. Likewise, the Chinese scorn the American chop suey and fortune cookies served in paper cartons, and no proud Mexicans would accept Taco Bell as traditional Mexican cuisine.
But that’s what makes the United States unique and fascinating, and why it is, indeed, an apple pie culture: a distinct creation and experience popularized through a combination of imported flavors and histories.
GREAT article, Sophia. You raise some interesting thoughts to “crunch” on.

In the ethnically diverse city of Los Angeles, use your appetite to take you on delicious and educational adventures around the globally rich world that is La-La Land.
Ethnic treasure · Restaurants like City Best Chicken, on Pico Boulevard, might not look like gourmet powerhouses from the outside, but the kitchens on the inside produce tantalizing meals that satisfy stomachs. - Brandon Hui | Daily Trojan
Forget Hollywood and Santa Monica Promenade. The true gems of Los Angeles are the numerous ethnic hole-in-the-wall eateries dotted all over the city, far from the elusive, camera-happy tourists and high-brow celebrities. But you’ll need to dig a bit.
Thai cuisine 
Street food in a Buddhist temple
Slip into Wat Thai Temple, a Buddhist sanctuary in North Hollywood, just a small distance away from the heavily commercial Thai Town. The enclave typically draws in the devout, but every weekend it lures in the hungry as well. That’s because the temple sells authentic Thai dishes like som tam (spicy, crunchy papaya salad), kanom krok (savory coconut rice pancakes) and kwaytiao reua (wide rice noodles in rich beef soup) for low prices. Be there early; good food runs out fast.
Mexican cuisine 
Taco stands
For those looking for a place closer to campus, hoof it up to Downtown’s Taco Mexico at the corner of Ninth Street and Broadway. It’s nothing frilly — just a simple white taco shack serving Mexican comfort food like al pastor (spit-grilled pork), lengua (beef tongue) and cabeza (roasted cow head) tacos. One tip: Don’t think about the nature of the meat. Just eat and enjoy.
Nepalese and Tibetan Cuisine
The Maikhan
Tara’s Himalayan Cuisine in Culver City is one of the few authentic places in Southern California serving typically ignored Nepalese and Tibetan dishes.
The interior is designed like the inner abode of a Maikhan (Tibetan nomadic tent) with glowing candles, lanterns and dark tapestries. Be aware, however, that this cuisine is heavy on the spices. The star dish is the yak chili, strips of dried bovine flesh — think beef jerky — sauteed with tomatoes, onion, bell pepper and liberal spices. Ask for a basket of fresh-baked, chewy naan as well to sop up the sauce or tame the heat.
Korean cuisine
Traditional tea house
At first glance, Koreatown seems to offer mostly all-you-can-eat bulgogi and galbi (Korean barbecue) houses and soju (Korean liquor) karaoke clubs, but for a more intimate exploration into Korean cuisine, wander into Hwa Sun Ji, a tranquil, petite, 18th-century style teahouse tucked under an obscure building on Wilshire Boulevard.
Refrain from ordering the usual black or green tea. The best and most authentic teas from Korea are the ones brewed from humble roots, fruits and grains. Try the yujacha, a refreshing, zingy tea made from the yuzu fruit, or yulmucha, an earthy tea made from roasted Job’s tears grains. Hwa Sun Ji also offers traditional Korean desserts, such as han-gwa, a colorful medley of cookies made from rice, flour and honey.
Mediterranean cuisine 
Chicken grill
For a hole-in-the-wall, City Best Chicken at Pico Boulevard is poorly hidden. You’ll smell the delicious char of marinated meat before you even spot its giant sign. Once you reach the entrance you can see whole chickens sitting on the outdoor grill on the way in, and by the time you enter the diner-style restaurant, you will know what the centerpiece of the menu is: chicken kabob, chicken shwarma, the half-chicken plate, you get the idea.
Something about the way the bird is cooked must seal in all the juices because the flesh is tender with pure Mediterranean marinade, served fresh off the grill. The restaurant also offers you four generous side dishes: usual sides like Greek salad, hummus, babaganoush, dolmas, basmati rice, tzatziki and fries.
Parking is limited, but if you do find a spot, you can sit and enjoy your meal at the communal picnic benches outdoors.

USC is a vibrant community with many attractions. Students, however, should not lose sight of USC’s greatest asset: Los Angeles. Strap on some sunglasses, straddle up the fanny packs and put on a little sunscreen. It’s time to be a tourist and discover some of Los Angeles’ finest hot spots.
Exposition roses · The Rose Garden at Exposition Park is a brief tourist getaway that, albeit off campus, is just a brief venture on Exposition Boulevard, around the corner from USC’s campus. - Carlo Acenas | Daily Trojan
Some attractions are immediately within walking distance. Across the street south of USC is Exposition Park, home to the peaceful Rose Garden, the California Science Center, the Natural History Museum and the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum, the stadium of the USC Trojans football team. And just west of the intersection of Jefferson Boulevard and Hoover Street is the Shrine Auditorium, the scene of award shows throughout the year.
Now, the rest of Los Angeles awaits. Just two miles separate USC from L.A. Live, an entertainment and dining hub of activity and, the location of both the Staples Center, the home of the Los Angeles Lakers, Clippers, and Kings, and the Los Angeles Convention Center.
Places not within walking distance are typically a bus or subway ride away. Despite the public transportation system’s bad reputation, it is incredibly efficient and can take residents to nearly any
destination.
Hollywood Boulevard and Sunset Boulevard are just a short ride away via Metro’s Red Line. Tourists stroll along the Walk of Fame, catch a free taping of Jimmy Kimmel Live!, browse the shops at the sprawling Hollywood & Highland complex, hike up to the Hollywood sign or take one of the infamous tours that take patrons past the homes of various celebrities. Sunset Boulevard and, most notably, the Sunset Strip is a hub for the nightlife scene with an extensive concoction of clubs and music venues, including The Roxy and Whiskey-A-Go-Go.
Keep heading west on Santa Monica Boulevard (yet another trendy area) and land in Beverly Hills to wander through the shops on Rodeo Drive.
Another upscale shopping destination, The Grove, is just a short bus ride (Metro line 217) away. It is full of stores and restaurants that cater to a college student’s budget, at least more so than Rodeo Drive. And if the timing is right, visitors can catch a live taping of Extra with host Mario Lopez.
Still not satisfied with Los Angeles’ trendy areas? Well, Downtown Burbank is home to even more shops and restaurants, in addition to various movie and television studios. There, one can snag tickets to see a taping of The Tonight Show with Jay Leno, The Ellen DeGeneres Show and Lopez Tonight.
But enough about activities on land, it’s time for a day at the beach. The area certainly does not lack for beaches, but the most popular ones tend to be Santa Monica and Venice.
Santa Monica, home to the famous pier and miniature amusement park, is a tourist hotspot with its enormous beach nicely complemented by the shops and dining at the adjacent Third Street Promenade. Venice Beach, however, is far more eclectic, with a lively mix of street performers and various beach vendors.
Of course a tourist’s trip is not complete without visiting amusement parks, of which there are no shortages.
Options include Disneyland in Anaheim (a single bus ride away — Metro line 460), Universal Studios Hollywood (a subway ride away), Knott’s Berry Farm (accessible by the same bus that goes to Disneyland) and Six Flags Magic Mountain (car needed). For extra fun and scares, check out what these parks have to offer around Halloween.
Finally, cap off any day by taking a trip up to Griffith Observatory (a free attraction) to view its various exhibits and take a look at the stars and planets through telescopes.
Students at USC should not take the extremely diverse and exciting city of Los Angeles for granted.
Just try to avoid a certain area in Westwood; it is not a very good neighborhood.
 
 
 
 
 
Really? Lopez Tonight? That show was cancelled a few days ago…

On any given weeknight, a college student might be sitting at the library with loads of homework anxiously awaiting the weekend. But not every weekday has to be dreary — to help alleviate the routine, the Levitt Pavilion in MacArthur Park and Memorial Park in Pasadena are offering a plethora of free concerts through September.
Ethnic singer · Moreno’s Guatemalan influences make her songs unique as they incorporate both Spanish and English verses. - Eva Recinos | Daily Trojan
And on a warm Saturday night, singers Gaby Moreno and Ceci Bastida said hello to a crowd of Angelenos settled down on blankets or the grass to see these colorful, talented acts at MacArthur Park.
Concerts like this one are free thanks to The Mortimer Levitt Foundation, which was created back in 1966. The foundation raises funds to expose new and exciting acts to communities like the one around MacArthur Park.
For those unfamiliar with this part of Downtown Los Angeles, it is one that is constantly bustling with street vendors, shoppers and screaming kids.
If you speak to a Los Angeles native, you’ll probably be warned about the high crime rate, but rest assured, the police presence was felt during the concert, both with patrol cars and Segways.
When Gaby Moreno hit the stage, located toward the back of the park, around 7 p.m. Saturday night armed with a guitar, it felt a little more like a cozy get-together than a concert — in the best way possible.
This Guatemalan musician has a sweet voice that rivals pop darlings Corinne Bailey Rae and Colbie Caillat. Moreno started with the saccharine tune “No Regrets,” with both Spanish and English verses. Her voice was heartfelt and smooth, but able to stay afloat during louder parts of the music, provided by her accompanying band.
Tunes like “Ave Que Emigra,” which Moreno dedicated to “everyone who came to this country looking for a better life,” were equal parts emotionally engaging and naturally danceable. But her most intriguing tune was “Garrick,” a song based on a poem. Here, the music and singing got theatrical with playful trombone notes perfectly complimenting Moreno as she showed her range.
Mexican native Ceci Bastida took the stage next, with a drum at her side and a full band backing her. With bright red boots and an attitude that filled the stage, Bastida showed she was in command and knew how to put on a good show.
Bastida’s energy didn’t let up as she moved her entire body to the rhythm of her raucous music. During the cymbal-happy, energetic “Veo La Marea,” Bastida sang confidently and even showed off her talent on the melodica, a small keyboard the musician blows through while hitting the keys. “Controla” had a dangerously seductive bass line and an irresistible hip-hop vibe, aided by Bastida’s DJ and two trombone players. Each song was louder than the next, with Bastida and bandmates never losing energy as the next explosive track started.
Bastida addressed the crowd at one point, saying, “You’re welcome to stand up too. I wish I had drinks for all of you.”
The statement soon got a couple of groups dancing energetically near the stage.
Though the spotlight was on her, the band’s chemistry was obvious, with trombone players dancing while providing background vocals. Their sounds fused well with the smoother DJ scratches, and at times Bastida and her drummer seemed perfectly synchronized as she aided him in loud pounding.
When Bastida came back for a satisfying encore, there was a sure sense of camaraderie among the audience, which ranged in ages and ethnicities. The pavilion stage went dark after her set, but the energy still seemed to be pulsing as concertgoers picked up their belongings and headed into the night.

If you’re a fan of nightlife culture, then you’re no stranger to electronic dance music. With origins dating back to the 1960s, EDM is not merely a music genre, but a collective of various sub-genres, trance, house, techno, dubstep and electro. A musical revolution once exclusive to raves and underground clubs, EDM is progressively garnering mainstream popularity.

Today, one need not visit dance music “meccas” such as Ibiza, Spain; Goa, India or Berlin to witness their favorite artists play. Los Angeles has become a hotspot for EDM — offering world-class nightclubs that invite superstar DJs on a frequent basis. Additionally, Southern California plays host to some of the world’s best musical festivals such as Coachella, Electric Daisy Carnival and the Love Festival.
Markus Schulz
In the last 10 years, Markus Schulz has fused the musical identities of progressive house and trance into his own creative persona to forge an inimitable hybrid sound. Following several highly ranked positions, Schulz pushed his way into the top 10 of DJ Magazine’s Top 100 chart, landing at No. 8 in 2008 and 2009. Schulz also hosts his own weekly radio show, “Global DJ Broadcast,” heads the progressive electronic label Coldharbour Recordings and maintains an active production schedule remixing new tracks.
 
Schulz will be preforming at Avalon on Aug. 20.
Felix Da Housecat, Paul Oakenfold & Funkagenda 
One of America’s longest running dance-music festivals returns for its 19th-annual Southern California date. The Generation Celebration returns with two massive arenas of music featuring the best in house, trance and progressive.
Headline artists include house music sensation Felix Da Housecat, popular for his electroclash and pop-house sound; Paul Oakenfold, one of the world’s first DJs to introduce progressive and ‘Goa trance’ to the mainstream crowds; and Funkagenda, the UK tech house giant infamous for his edgy and acid house influenced beats.
 
These three will headline the Love Festival at Oak Canyon Ranch in Silverado, Calif,. on Aug. 20.
Deadmau5 
Ranked as world’s fifth-best DJ and house artist of the MTV Video Music Awards, Deadmau5 is undoubtedly one of the most influential and forward thinkers in the electronic music industry. His spontaneity and explosive energy on stage allow him to excel as a live performer — primarily playing his own, original material, assembling tracks on the fly and using cutting edge computer technology, including software he’s helped write himself — an approach that’s catapulted Deadmau5 into dance music’s A-list.
Although Deadmau5 initially gained popularity because of his signature style of progressive music, his live performances are an eclectic mix of house, electro and techno. One can expect lots of hypnotic melodies, long breakdowns and a dash of gut-wrenching techno from this superstar DJ’s sets.
 
Deadmau5 will be preforming at the Hollywood Palladium on Aug. 25.
i can’t wait for the love festival! i go every yearrr! <3

So, your summer reading fell by the wayside once again? Not to worry, for there are plenty of interesting books to keep you occupied for the upcoming months.
To circumvent the approaching monotony of homework assignments and busy work, or to expand your literary horizons, check out the following books, all of which transport audiences to different times and explore themes still relevant today.
The Help by Kathryn Stockett
The Help serves as a wonderful mixture of easy reading and heavy subject matter, which lets you focus on the topic at hand rather than get bogged down in needlessly long passages.
Although the novel was released in 2009, it has received renewed media attention after the release of the movie version on Aug. 10. With this media crossover, there’s always the question of whether or not to read the book. In this case, the book is a must.
The story takes place in Jackson, Mississippi, and is written from the points of view of three different characters: Miss Skeeter, a young white woman taking a stand for “the help;” Aibileen, a housemaid who finds the courage to tell her story; and Minny, Aibileen’s sassy best friend who follows Aibileen’s lead to come out with the truth.
Stockett switches perspectives brilliantly, always making the reader hungry for more of each story as she paints a moving depiction of racism in the 1960s.
Queen Defiant by Anne O’Brien
Queen Defiant tells the story of
Eleanor of Aquitaine, a woman who lived in the 12th century and earned the title of Queen of both France and England in her lifetime.
If you’re a history buff, the first few pages reveal the potential the book holds: Family trees of the main historical figures that appear throughout the book and a map displaying the territories of France, Aquitaine and Anjou are sure to entice.
The rest of the story is interesting and
alluring as it maintains a steady pace. O’Brien does not try to whitewash Eleanor, nor does she portray her as unforgivable. Instead, Eleanor’s character is easy to identify with.
For example, Eleanor’s sex scenes are actually important to the plotline instead of serving as extraneous details simply to add length. In a story filled with adulterous relationships, a monk-like king and even the Second Crusade, how can you go wrong?
The best part of the novel is the truth behind it. O’Brien was a history teacher long before she was an author, so (one can hope) she did not deviate from the original history.
The September Society by Charles Finch
The September Society is the second in a series of mysteries by Charles Finch that tell the story of Detective Charles Lenox of London in the mid 1800s. A murder has occurred at Oxford, and Lenox must revisit his college years as he investigates the case.
Lenox is an interesting main character, if not the best detective in the world, but he admits to his shortcomings, and his relationship with neighbor Lady Jane is endearing. Finch fleshes out Lenox’s character outside of his being a detective, and also includes some history and fun facts.
The book contains some descriptions of Oxford that can be a bit long and seemingly irrelevant, but ultimately they don’t take away from the book’s integrity.
Finally, there are some certainly unexpected twists in the book, and although Finch’s book is not on the level of an Agatha Christie mystery, it’s certainly an enjoyable read.
It’s always nice to be transported to a different time, which  The Help, Queen Defiant, and The September Society all allow readers to do.
So if you are looking for an escape from the tedium of schoolwork, or would simply love to learn more about another era, curl up with any one of these books and relax for an hour or two.

For incoming college freshmen and continuing students, it never hurts to think of fitness. With a free gym available and all of the horrors of college eating — bring on the ramen — it is never a bad thing to consider exercising or trying out healthier eating habits. Unfortunately, much of the fitness world focuses exclusively on a narrow, modern view of health that ignores successful methods from around the world.
Student bikers · Although students might not realize it, riding a bike is not just an efficient way to get to class, but it can also be a superb way to achieve a rewarding aerobic, cardiovascular and muscular workout. - Daily Trojan file photo
There’s a strong homogenization of American workout methods when it comes to fitness, in literature and in practice. Heavy weight lifting, mixed with chemical-laden pre-made protein drinks with the idea of getting “swole.” It’s that or heavily modified food intake aimed at some narrow diet. These might, and in many cases do, work, but better options are out there.
Take Bruce Lee as an example. He was relatively short and weighed only around 140 pounds, and yet he stands as a pinnacle of fitness. His body fat was almost nonexistent and every muscle was well built. He accomplished this through a mix of aerobic and anaerobic exercises, mostly through martial arts.
A Shaolin gongfu master, Lee drew on generation-old teachings. He believed in complex exercises that worked multiple muscles across the body rather than just isolated muscle building.
Since strong body parts are useless without coordination and skill, try to do workouts that focus on the whole body to build strength, instead of splitting things up to build size.
Not everyone has the time for the intense workouts gongfu demands. For quick, everyday exercise that’s also extremely practical, go Dutch. Ride a bike.
While visiting the city of Amsterdam, it was hard not to notice the multitude of bicycles lining the streets. People are fit. It’s a city with a multitude of bakeries and pastry shops, not to mention beer houses full of rich ales, yet the people are active and healthy. Biking offers great cardiovascular exercise, strengthening the lower body while being easier on the feet than running.
And it’s practical for college. Although last year there was a bit of a crisis over the continued presence of bicycles on campus, the fact remains they will stick around. Plus, they are a great way to get around, especially if you need to get to another class across campus in a short amount of time. Although Los Angeles is a car city, opt for the tried-and-true method from around the world and bike.
And when it comes to diet — the other key to a healthy body —try slowing down when eating. The United States tends toward quick, fast-paced eating habits perfect for a busy schedule but terrible on the body. Around the world, particularly in European countries, portions are smaller, and eaten at a much slower pace. These are countries where pastries and other fatty foods are common staples, and yet the people tend to stay slim. So stop, sit back and enjoy a meal. Don’t rush.
As for what to eat, look to the traditional Greek diet. The so-called “Mediterranean diet” is often cited as one of the best, and longest enduring, diets in the world, but the Greek diet in particular is the most beneficial. It is high in vegetables, meat, seafood and good fats like feta cheese and olive oil. Foods such as bread or sugars are minimal to nonexistent in the diet, keeping fat gains low and vitamins and minerals high.
Cutting out the sugars helps the body stabilize blood sugar levels and gives more energy to the body and burns fat. Is it as cheap as a ramen diet? No, but much better for you in the long run.
Similarly, a bit of exercise after each meal can be advantageous.
There’s an old Chinese proverb that says walking 100 steps can lead to increased longevity.
Muscular contraction activates certain chemicals in the body
—glucose transporter type 4 or GLUT-4 — to help move calories into muscles rather than build fat cells. A few quick exercises after eating can put that energy toward things other than fat.
Then there is stress. College can be an extremely stressful time on its own, not counting the sleep deprivation and caffeine dependence. In this case, why not try meditation? Buddhist meditation is practiced around the world, and works well. This does not mean going “omm” a lot.
Instead, focus on controlled breathing and putting the mind toward a good memory or goal. Simply stepping back from school work and resting the mind for a bit can do wonders and prevent mental burnout.
Fitness is more than just muscle size and nutritional supplements. Humans practiced healthy habits, and powerful workouts, for centuries. Sometimes the trick is to look outside of the mainstream for better options, and in this case, the world offers many useful methods.

Summer is almost over, but even incoming freshmen can look forward to a thrilling assortment of video games this fall. And we’re not talking about American ones.
The fall’s new releases are part of a surprisingly diverse amalgam. Several of the most highly anticipated video games were designed by companies across the world and are slated for international releases in the coming months.
From the gruesome zombies of Dead Island to the lighthearted Tanooki Mario, these internationally based bestsellers are ones to look out for.
Dead Island — Sept. 6
Sick of fighting zombies in dull apocalyptic adventure games? Try fighting them off with three of your friends.
In Dead Island, players ward off the undead in an open-world paradise on the fictitious island of Banoi. The story follows a handful of characters staying at the utopian island’s luxurious Royal Palms Resort where a sudden outbreak infects the residents and quickly leads to a movie-inspired zombie apocalypse.
Polish developer Techland makes Dead Island stand apart from similarly themed games with an emphasis on survival, weapon customization, exploration and melee-style (disorganized hand-to-hand fighting) combat.
In addition, the game features an array of characters from across the world. Logan is the epitome of an all-American muscle man, whereas Xian Mei is a savvy, intelligent traveler from China.
You’re bound to enjoy this game more than the average shooter scenario, given its unique combat-style and assemblage of versatile characters.
Batman: Arkham City —
Oct. 18
In this exciting sequel to the award-winning 2009 Batman: Arkham Asylum, the Dark Knight returns for more daring, haunting adventures against the criminals of Gotham.
Like its predecessor, Batman: Arkham City serves as a wonderful tribute to the eerie cinematography found in Christopher Nolan’s 2008 film.
But this new game stands on its own. The introduction of Catwoman as a playable character allows for a potentially broader female audience. With her own levels and power-ups, the frisky feline pushes the game in a new
direction with more challenging and versatile game play.
Although Batman is a quintessential American superhero, Arkham Asylum and Arkham City were designed by British game developer Rocksteady Studios.
The series of video games has already garnered positive feedback around the world. In fact, Arkham Asylum earned a Guinness World Record for “Most Critically Acclaimed Superhero Game Ever.”
With such high expectations, there’s no doubt that Arkham City can easily steal this spot from its companion.
Super Mario 3D Land —
November 
Although 3D technology is fizzling faster than Mario’s invincible star power, Nintendo has vowed to wow the world with its first major platform game for the Nintendo 3DS this November.
Not much is confirmed in terms of storyline, but the game appears to be a continuation of the Super Mario Galaxy series. Both the Galaxy games and Super Mario 3D Land were developed by the same team and are similar in terms of graphics, items and overall game play.
To capitalize on the 3D aspect and maximize game play, however, Nintendo has chosen to incorporate a combination of 2D- and 3D-style sequences as a capstone to Mario’s latest transition.
In a surprise to many fans, Nintendo also confirmed the reintroduction of Tanooki Mario from Super Mario Bros. 3. The form turns Mario into a raccoon-like animal with a handy tail for floating and attacking.
Although Nintendo has scheduled a worldwide price cut for the poorly selling Nintendo 3DS in the upcoming month, the Japan-based company has high hopes for Super Mario 3D Land to increase sales internationally following its release.
Different storylines and nuanced styles in these new releases are iconic of the cultural expansion of the industry and subsequently unite gamers across the globe.

The best way to experience a country is to walk its streets, eat its food and have an amusing misadventure that involves stolen passports and mistaken identities. But when a plane ticket isn’t affordable, foreign cinema is the next best thing.
Though film has existed as a means of entertainment and an exploration of art, it has also expressed a country’s vision of itself. To watch foreign films is to see an aspect of a country’s soul and history.
Watch enough of a country’s cinema and the viewer begins to see common threads. Korea, for example, seems to have a penchant for gory revenge films. Jee-woon Kim’s 2010 I Saw the Devil follows a secret agent’s gory manhunt for his fiancée’s killer as the secret agent becomes a monster himself.
Revenge films in Korea, however, are rarely about simple vengeance; they traditionally concern either family or relationships. In Chan-wook Park’s 2002 Sympathy for Mr. Vengeance, a brother goes on the warpath after black market thugs swindle him out of his money and a kidney, which he sold to pay for his sister’s own kidney transplant. Korean culture places a huge emphasis on family. Who says family values can’t have some carnage on the side?
Cinema also expresses a country’s ideals, as in 1950’s Cyrano de Bergerac (remade in 1990). The romantic panache synonymous with France is clear in this classic, a swashbuckling drama of a man who romances his ladylove through the letters of another man. And 2006’s quixotic Paris Je t’aime, a compilation of short films, is full of whimsical French passion.
Whether it’s death as a cowboy or a nuclear mime family, these French films are love letters to Paris. Recall, however, the French riots not so long ago, where the most passionate thing burning was cars, not romance. A film like 1995’s La Haine shows a completely different side of France, rife with racial and social tensions and far away from baguettes and billet-doux.
Foreign cinema even exhibits a country’s pride. With China, much of this pride lies in its past, as seen in wuxia films, such as 2002’s Hero with Jet Li and 2000’s Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon with Chow Yun-Fat. Though it’s unlikely Chinese heroes performed physics-breaking ballet battles in the woods, the films encompass a time period when China was the most advanced nation in the world.
Other times, a film set in an historical era can be a reflective and critical look at a former time period, such as the 2006 Spanish dark fantasy Pan’s Labyrinth. A look past the fairies getting their heads bitten off finds a brutal look at Franco-era Spain.
But just as The Hangover II does not comprise the pulsing spirit of America, not every foreign film cares to condense a country’s psyche. Take Russia; it is one of the largest countries in the world with rulers as different as Catherine the Great and Joseph Stalin, neither of whom was Russian.
One of Russia’s highest-grossing films, Timur Bekmambetov’s 2006 Day Watch, is a frenetic beast of good vs. evil, high-flying CGI and howling Euro rock. Yet it keeps its philosophical focus on desperate hopes and failed dreams — think Dostoevsky with less eloquence and more vampires.
On the flip side, Joseph Stalin’s favorite film was a song-and-dance comedy called Volga-Volga.
To look at one or two foreign films as a complete portrait of a country is stopping short. Film is an international form of self-expression, not a direct representation of a country or its ideals. Given some nations’ penchants for civil wars, a country’s people doesn’t always have the same values. But delve into a country’s cinema and soon you will start to see common threads that weave together to give you an organic look at a country.
