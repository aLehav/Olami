Book-shaped cake pan: You can bake your book and read (eat?) it, too. $22 on Amazon.

For the coffee lover
The Aeropress ($29.95)
Chances are, the coffee connoisseur of your life is either in a complicated relationship with their Ikea French press or being debilitated by the hands of their $10 Mr. Coffee bean-burner … I mean drip machine. Don’t let them suffer anymore! Introduce The Aeropress: The one-minute, single-serve coffee and (kind of) espresso maker. Though this lil’ gem sounds too good to be true, it’s the real deal. There’s about a 30-second learning curve and when your apartment mate gets their recipe down, you have my blessing to enter them into the World AeroPress Championship.

Hario Coffee Mini Mill Grinder ($21) Cardinal Coffee Rule #1: Thou shalt not brew pre-ground coffee. Okay, so maybe I tend to break this rule more than I am proud to admit, but I totally wouldn’t if one of my friends got me this lovely thing for Christmas (ahem). I’m telling you, if you’ve never experienced the joy of freshly ground coffee, you’re missing out. The flavor notes are ten times more apparent and, to focus on the real issues here, it makes your kitchen smell delectable. Bless both you and your roommate with this glorified pencil-sharpener looking contraption, and you will both be gifted by the sweet, sweet smell of coffee. Trust.

Tasteful Coffee Prints ($20-35)
If your favorite espresso expert is anything like me, they’re probably a liiiiitle bit pretentious (in the most acceptable way). Basically, they curse the uprising of vector art and the current print market for their favorite beverage simply will not do. That’s with The Department of Brewology comes in. Run by former barista and current illustrator, Mr. David Salinas, The Department is home to some of the most aesthetic prints on the market, and no matter your friend’s preferred brewing method, you’ll be sure to find a print to fit their life.

A Drinking Vessel (potentially free)
So maybe you can’t afford a $20 present this year. That’s chill! I promise you, your coffee companion doesn’t have enough things to drink coffee out of. Mugs? They need one. Personalized mugs? They need ten. Fancy-schmancy Zojirushi thermoses that keep hot drinks hot for up to hours? They need one in every color. Anything’s fair game.

Coffee! ($5-40) When in doubt, just get ‘em something you already know they love: Coffee! There are a TON of specialty roasters right here in L.A., and you’d have to try to not find something your brew buddy won’t love. From Stumptown to Urth Caffé, everyone’s out here trying to sell what they believe is a great cup o’ joe.

Former USC assistant coach Todd McNair is allowed to proceed in his defamation lawsuit against the NCAA, a California appellate court ruled on Monday.
The three-judge panel ruled in favor of McNair after the NCAA appealed to have the lawsuit thrown out.
McNair, who coached at USC from 2005-2010, was given a show cause penalty by the NCAA for allegedly being aware of violations that former running back Reggie Bush committed while at USC and lying to investigators.
McNair filed the lawsuit in June of 2011, claiming libel and slander. Monday’s decision by the appellate court supported the ruling of a Superior Court judge in 2012, who also rejected the NCAA’s efforts to have the case thrown out. The panel noted McNair had a “probability of prevailing on the merits” of his defamation lawsuit.
The NCAA can either ask the appellate court to reconsider its decision or appeal to the California Supreme Court.
“McNair presented admissible evidence, which if credited by a jury, indicates that he did not know about the NCAA violations, in which case the operative statement is susceptible of a false meaning,” the court ruled.
While the court threw out McNair’s claim that the penalty resulted in him losing his job at USC, it could reignite the debate over the harsh sanctions levied against the school’s football program as a result of Bush’s violations. If, indeed, McNair was unaware that Bush received improper benefits during his time at USC, the NCAA could not have sanctioned the school without a university employee being aware of Bush’s activity.
In its ruling, the court stated that the NCAA’s investigation centered on a two-minute phone conversation between McNair and Lloyd Lake, a would-be marketer who provided Bush with illegal benefits. But the court, citing an interview with Lake, cast doubt that McNair learned about Bush’s activity from Lake.
“Nowhere during Lake’s description of the two-minute call did Lake ever say that he informed McNair of, or that McNair claimed knowledge about, the agency agreement and improper benefits,” the court ruled. “Instead, Lake speculated that Bush told McNair, or that McNair knew from osmosis because ‘he was around a lot’ and ‘watched.’”
In addition to a two-year bowl ban and loss of 30 scholarships over three years, USC was forced to vacate its 2004 BCS national championship and its wins during the 2005 season as part of the sanctions levied by the NCAA in 2010. Bush also voluntarily forfeited his 2005 Heisman Trophy.
