Though public diplomacy is a well-known phrase when it comes to international issues, Director of the British Council to the United States Paul Smith stressed his preference of the term “cultural relations” on Thursday at an event hosted by the USC Center on Public Diplomacy.
“To a degree, I would argue that [cultural relations] does differ quite significantly from public diplomacy,” Smith said. “The relationship really is about trying to engender trust between people who may not initially have reason to trust each other.”

The importance of understanding other cultures remained the focus of Smith’s talk to an audience of about 30, many of whom were graduate students in the public diplomacy master’s program.
“Getting public diplomacy to happen is the challenge of our times,” Smith said.
To Smith, the use of the term “cultural relations” also better encompasses the efforts that he has been a part of throughout his career.
“Over the years, the British Council has moved towards using another phrase and that phrase we use is cultural relations,” Smith said. “We believe that all the work that we do comes from the umbrella of that phrase.”
Smith previously served on the British Council in Nigeria, Burma, Chile, Germany, Bangladesh, New Zealand, West India, Egypt and Afghanistan before coming to the United States last August as Director of British Council and Cultural Counsellor at the British Embassy in Washington D.C. In line with his experience, Smith emphasized the importance of all nations having diplomacy efforts.
“It is an essential attribute to most countries’ international foreign policy to have public diplomacy programs,” Smith said.
Smith likened nations to a “four-legged chair” rather than the traditional “three-legged stool,” explaining that the three traditional legs of governance, economics and security are not enough to support a nation.
“If it’s a three-legged chair, it’s going to fall over,” Smith said. “That fourth leg is culture.”
Lauren Allison, a first year masters student in public diplomacy, came to hear Smith because of his vast experience in the field of public diplomacy.
“I find it really fascinating,” Allison said. “It’s really great to have someone at USC who has insight and 30-plus years of experience in cultural diplomacy around the world.”
Kia Hays, a second-year student in the masters program on public diplomacy, said she enjoyed how Smith’s talk mirrored a lot of what she was learning in the classroom.
“I agreed very much with a lot of what he said,” Hays said. “It is nice to see a professional saying the same things we see in an academic setting.”

The human brain is full of complexities — it can be both a great asset and an aggravating impediment.
Surviving · Professor Saks says her tenure at USC has given her the support to deal with juggling her work, relationships and her health. – Courtesy of Elyn Saks
Elyn Saks, a professor at the Gould School of Law who also served as its associate dean for research and is the Orrin B. Evans Professor of Law, Psychology and Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences, knows this all too well: She received a diagnosis of schizophrenia and acute psychosis when she was 21 years old.
“I sometimes say my mind has been my best friend and worst enemy,” Saks said. “Worst enemy for obvious reasons, best friend because when I’m working it keeps me productive and keeps me occupied.”
Saks thrives while successfully juggling therapy, medication and relationships and still enduring the social stigma that surrounds mental illness.
“I sometimes say my mind has been my best friend and worst enemy,” Saks said. “Worst enemy for obvious reasons, best friend because when I’m working it keeps me productive and keeps me occupied.”
Saks initially did not intend to enter education. While at Yale Law school, she represented psychiatric patients and children and continued her pro bono work after graduation at the Yale Legal Services Mental Health Law Project. She wanted to be a public-interest lawyer, but her experience teaching in Connecticut led her to apply for teaching positions across the country.
“USC was my best offer,” said Saks, who joined the USC law faculty in 1989.
Though Saks believes she made the best decision for her, she initially had regrets about entering the teaching field.
“I kind of felt I sold out a little when I became an academic because I wasn’t in the trenches,” Saks said. “People have different aptitudes and ways of contributing and, for me, just writing stuff that people who are good advocates could take and use was where my best contribution could come.”
However, Saks said her experience in the academic field has proved rewarding. Her gratification comes from working one on one with students.
“I enjoy helping people navigate and get resources and referrals [as well as] being a model for someone, and an ‘I-can-you-can’ type,” Saks said.
Saks is supported by good therapy, medication, family, friends and her work at USC.
“USC is an incredibly generous, kind, supportive, nurturing and intellectually stimulating place,” Saks said. “Putting all these supports in place for professors and students to thrive … it’s an incredible place.”
After winning a MacArthur Foundation genius grant in 2009, Saks founded the Saks Institute for Mental Health Law, Policy, and Ethics, which looks at mental health through an interdisciplinary lens.
Students get a unique perspective from Saks. Susie Morris, a third-year resident in the psychiatry program at Los Angeles County-USC Medical Center and an intern at the Saks Institute, said Saks’ teaching comes with a uniquely helpful perspective because Saks has first-hand experience with a mental disorder.
“[I find her] more credible because she is working from the inside looking out,” Morris said. “She offers a different perspective because she was actually hospitalized herself, which isn’t something you can truly learn about just by reading a book.”
Saks was hospitalized for one month in 1978 and four months in 1979. In 1982 and 1983, she was hospitalized for five months and has not been hospitalized since.
Paul Garcia, one of Sak’s former students and a current second-year law student, views Saks’ honesty as a vital addition to his learning experience.
“It was really interesting and compelling, given her life narrative, to not only be in a class and hear her talk openly about some of the struggles she’s faced, but also to see the quality of her work and how well known she is in the field,” Garcia said.
Saks is nationally renowned for her work in the mental health industry. In 2007, Saks published her memoir, The Center Cannot Hold: My Journey Through Madness, after her friends encouraged her to tell her story.
“I had twin goals in writing it,” Saks said. “To give hope to people who suffer with schizophrenia and understanding to those who don’t.”
Saks explains how “people who are struggling, hurting or in pain could get treatment and could get relief but they don’t because they don’t want the stigma so they suffer” instead of coming forward and admitting to their condition.
“To me, the biggest problem with stigma is that it deters people from getting care, but there are also other problems,” she said. “It makes you feel lesser and stay in hiding.”
Even Saks struggled with accepting the need for medication. But she said once she did use it continuously, her life got better.
“I used to say I don’t want to use a crutch,” Saks said. “Now I say that if my foot were broken of course I’d use a crutch. Shouldn’t I treat my neurotransmitters as gently?”
Through her efforts in the field of law, Saks exemplifies her own belief that people carry overtly low expectations for those with mental illness: A doctor once told her that she should settle for being a cashier.
Saks acknowledges that not every person with her condition will attain an academic position like her but said support will go a long way. Saks’ main hope is to continue illuminating issues of mental health through her love and work.
“People with psychiatric illness want what everyone wants,” Saks said. “In the words of Sigmund Freud: ‘to love and to work.’ So, when you see someone who looks like they’re having a hard time, or they tell you they’re having a hard time be sympathetic, be empathic, try and be a good friend, try and be supportive and realize that mental illness is really no different from diabetes or other conditions.”
Prof. Saks’ story is certainly quite encouraging for anyone struggling with with mental health issues, whether their own, or loved ones. Her own personal contribution to understanding the issues involved is much appreciated.

Bikes are a popular method among students for getting around campus, but issues arise when they mix with other forms of traffic.
Designated bike lanes, which were implemented along the often-crowded Trousdale Parkway last semester, were put in place to ease the traffic flow. However, students have complained that the lanes have failed to live up to their promise.
Wrong way · Prior to the bike lanes, a Dept. of Public Safety survey found nearly 25 percent of undergraduates were involved in accidents. — Austin Vogel | Daily Trojan
In a survey conducted prior to the lanes’ installment, nearly 25 percent of USC’s undergraduates said they had been involved in a collision within the past year. Dept. of Public Safety Captain David Carlisle said that it is unclear whether the lanes have prevented further collisions since most incidents go unreported.
Some students, such as Jeremy Chen, an undeclared freshman, expressed reservations about the lanes’ effectiveness.
“[The lanes] help, but not to a large degree,” Chen said. “There are times when … [Trousdale] still seems super congested.”
Vice President of Student Affairs Michael L. Jackson said the boundaries created by the lanes were meant to show students where to ride or bike safely.
“When I walked in the center of campus before, I felt vulnerable,” Jackson said. “But the lanes have helped me feel safer.”
Ekua Armah, a sophomore majoring in psychology, said though the lanes make it clear which way to go, the issue arises when pedestrians cut across the bike path and interrupt the flow of traffic.
“It’s annoying,” Armah said. “People wander aimlessly into the lanes and just aren’t paying attention to their surroundings.”
Some students complained about the inconvenience of dismounting bikes during peak traffic hours, as well as the difficulty of entering and exiting the only designated bike lane on campus.
“Since the lanes are only on Trousdale, it is really hard during rush hours to exit the lanes and make your way through all the people to get to other parts of campus,” Armah said.
USC hired Kendall Planning and Design  last October to formulate a comprehensive plan to make the campus friendlier to bikers and pedestrians alike. Principal Architect Alison Kendall said there is significant room for improvement.
“The bike lanes are only the beginning,” Kendall said.
Kendall said she, along with a consulting team, came up with hundreds of recommendations for improvement.
Though some ideas would work on the issue in the long term, Kendall emphasized that there are still more immediate solutions, like educational programs.
Kendall said passing out plans that show bike routes and give a “basic overview of the rules of the road in L.A.” would allow bikers to familiarize themselves with the lanes and learn how to safely travel around campus and the city.
Though there are currently no plans to expand the lanes or alter existing policies, Kendall will be speaking on a panel with community service officer Charles May, as a part of the “Campus Conversations” speaker series in March.
“This is not something you solve all at once,” Kendall said. “There’s plenty of potential for improvement.”
During the first several weeks of the fall semester, DPS officers were stationed along the lanes to enforce the lane policy.
“The lanes have been very effective when officers are there on Trousdale and 34th,” Carlisle said. “It’s been easier since people know where to go and there seem to be less collisions within the lanes.”
The stationing of officers to enforce the policy is only temporary; however, Carlisle said soon officers will only be there when staffing allows it.
“[I] hope the positive behaviors will continue, as it is in the best interest of everyone,” Carlisle said.
Jackson observed that pedestrians only followed protocol when DPS officers were present last semester.
“Some people were just rude and inconsiderate and didn’t pay any attention to [the lanes],” Jackson said of the unguarded lanes.
USC Bookstore employee Rachel Diggs is less sure of the lanes’ future effectiveness.
“People are still going to take their own path, regardless of the rules,” Diggs said.
Christina Nour, a freshman majoring in civil engineering said,  the lanes can cause more harm than good if not used appropriately.
“The lanes can help if people use them the way they are meant to be used,” Nour said. “But when bikers don’t ride in the bike lanes and pedestrians don’t walk in the designated walkways, then there’s chaos.”
I was very skeptical about the sharrows when they were installed, but they’ve appeared to work much better than I expected.  Still, to be really effective, it should have been done with the strategy that was proposed by one of the teams making suggestions – if the bike strips were asphalt while the pedestrian parts were textured cobblestones, then they would both be much more visible, and naturally encourage bikes to stay on the smooth pavement.
When I ride my bicycle on these “orange” sharrows, I find their position to be counter intuitive…I have to ride on the left going from Adams to Expo Blvd (instead of the right).  Unfortunately, if there are a lot of people walking on the sharrows, one doesn’t know they are even there.  Since Trousdale is the only designated area for bicyclst…I would recommend that there are bike lanes and perhaps an orange color painted on the surface of the corridor, so that pedestrians and bicyclsts can see where they should be located.
I completely disagree — though it does take a little getting used to in terms of riding on the left (though its only the left portion of the right half of the roadway, so its not THAT hard), I really appreciate how simple and aesthetically pleasing the cardinal and gold sharrows on the ground are. When coupled with the silver blockades every few yards, I think that’s all you really need to show people where to go. Plus, as new generations of Trojans come in, the rules of the road become second nature. I’ll be the first to say as an older student, I forget sometimes about the lanes, but every Freshman I know is quick to follow them because that’s all they know. With time, the lanes will work out!
We should be thankful that USC, in this instance, is not trying to duplicate the stupidity of its crosstown rival.
Bicycles are a natural in a campus setting, always have been, and always will be.
If pedestrians need helmets, radar, and training in how to walk safely, i.e. not wearing headphones or texting or chatting, so be it.
While cyclists can use a refresher course in politeness, and we really need to school them on how not to get killed on the street – no zigzagging, no iphones, no wrong-way riding, no running stop signs, on campus, in bike lanes, they are not the problem.
If you’re riding a bike, ride in the bike lane. If you’re not riding a bike, walk in the pedestrian lane. Simple!
Accomodating bikes is important.  They are a cost effective, environmentally friendly, efficient form of transport.  Building bike infrastructure is extremely cheap in comparison to car infrastructure.
Support the cycling movement in the USA
Sometimes it takes awhile to modify behaviors…but I am optimistic that there will be improvement. Convenience and safety can both be achieved.
Student logic and self importance always brings a smile to my face.

USC has suspended head baseball coach Frank Cruz pending an internal investigation into whether his program violated NCAA bylaws by spending excessive time working with players, the university announced Thursday.
Assistant head coach Dan Hubbs will lead the team as interim head coach, as the Trojans head into their alumni game on Sunday at Dedeaux Field. Cruz was entering his third season with the Trojans.
NCAA rules limit the number of hours players can spend participating in activities supervised by coaches. The investigation will probe whether excessive countable athletically-related activities occurred during Cruz’s watch.
“We take any potential NCAA infraction seriously,” Athletic Director Pat Haden said in a statement. “USC Vice President for Athletic Compliance Dave Roberts and his staff will investigate whether the baseball program exceeded the allowable CARA hours, and will do so diligently and expeditiously. Pending the results of the investigation, we have suspended Coach Cruz from all coaching duties.”
After Sunday, the Trojans will take on Cal State Fullerton on the road.

Singer has recognized USC’s impact on his successful career with a $5 million naming donation made to the Bryan Singer Division of Critical Studies, according to the School of Cinematic Arts.
Singer said he is “honored to give back” to the school that in many ways started his career.
“In a way, I began my career in the division of Critical Studies at USC,” Singer said. “Watching great films and learning how to think about film from the faculty transformed me as an artist and as a person.”
Singer’s donation is intended to help USC students follow in his footsteps by offering them courses focusing on a wide range of media, from major Hollywood films to content on Internet outlets such as YouTube. Students in the program also learn how the changing forms of media affect greater society.
Singer’s various projects since his graduation in 1989 have grossed more than $2 billion worldwide, making him one of the most successful filmmakers today. He is currently in pre-production for the film X-Men: Days of Future Past.

Riding a four-game winning streak, the USC women’s tennis team is set to face off against host team Virginia in the first round of the ITA National Indoor Intercollegiate Championships in Charlottesville, Va. this weekend.
Seeded third in the tournament behind UCLA and Duke, the Women of Troy (4-0) have a tough draw in the opening round against a Cavaliers team that will have heavy support from the crowd. Heading into the match, USC is looking to record its fifth straight shutout in as many games this season, which would mark the first time that has happened since 1982.
“Virginia is a tough, challenging team, and they really match up well against us and it should be a good match,” USC head coach Richard Gallien said. “We’re healthy physically and mentally, and we are ready to go out there.”
Last season, the Women of Troy also came into the ITA National Indoors undefeated (5-0) but were seeded at No. 16 in the tournament. After upsetting No. 8 North Carolina in the first round, USC would make it all the way to the semifinals — the first time that had happened since 2003 — before bowing out against UCLA.
On the doubles’ side, junior Kaitlyn Christian and sophomore Sabrina Santamaria have won two consecutive ITA National Indoor Doubles titles and currently sit at the top of the national rankings.
Virginia will present a stiff test for the Women of Troy, not only because of the home field advantage, but because of their ability to match up with USC in both singles and doubles. Led by freshman Julia Elbaba, who currently ranks No. 4 in the nation, the Cavaliers also boast a pair of ranked players in Stephanie Nauta and Li Xi, who sit at No. 43 and 44, respectively.
Nauta and Xi form one of the nation’s best doubles tandems and their No. 10 ranking is indicative of their strong play, which includes a trip to the finals of the 2012 USTA/ITA National Indoor Intercollegiate Championships where they fell to Christian and Santamaria. Though the pair of Erin Vierra and Maci Epstein did not make it as far in the 2012 USTA/ITA Indoor Championships, they are ranked higher nationally, at No. 5, than their teammates.
Virginia automatically qualified for the tournament because of their status as the host team. The Cavaliers have played just one match so far this spring, defeating VCU 5-2.
The Women of Troy will counter the Virginia attack with a quartet of ranked singles players as well, led by senior Danielle Lao. Though the rankings have not changed, the new polls this month should see a rise for each of the girls. Sophomore standout Giuliana Olmos, in particular, might see her name attached to a ranking this time around.
The Jan. 29 Pac-12 player of the week has shined brightly in USC’s strong start to the year, and Gallien has been extremely impressed with her hard-nosed style of play. Already returning a strong lineup from last season, the addition of Olmos helps make USC a NCAA title contender.
With a win against Virginia, the Women of Troy will play against either Texas A&M or have a rematch with No. 6 North Carolina in the next round.
“There’s no one in this tournament who can bully us,” Gallien said. “We just need to go out and play to our ability.”

After dropping three out of four games during a four-game homestand, the Women of Troy will head north this weekend to take on the Washington State Cougars on Friday and the Washington Huskies on Sunday.
The Trojans (8-13, 5-5                            Pac-12) are looking to recover from their sluggish efforts at home last weekend after losing 63-60 to Utah on Feb. 1 and 65-49 to Colorado at the Galen Center on Feb. 3. USC led at halftime in both games before being outscored, outshot and outplayed by their opponents in the second half.
In the loss against Utah, sophomore guard Ariya Crook and junior forward Cassie Harberts combined for 29 of USC’s 34        second-half points, finishing with 20 and 19 points, respectively. The Trojans, however, could not stop Utah’s hot hand in the second half, as the Utes shot 57 percent from the field.
“We are on a quest to put together 40 minutes of good basketball on both offense and defense,” USC head coach Michael Cooper said. “It’s going to take more than one half of good basketball to win the game, and I feel that as a team, we have learned that.”
The story of the Colorado game was turnovers, as USC committed 13 turnovers in the second half and 19 total for the game. The Trojans lost their 31-26 halftime lead and threw away an opportunity for its first win against a ranked team; Colorado was ranked No. 22 at the time.
“We need to value the basketball a lot more than we usually do,” Cooper said. “When we beat ourselves, it’s very easy for other teams to beat us because they don’t have to put forward the giant effort that it takes to beat us.”
This Washington road trip comes at a good time for the Trojans, as they defeated both schools in their first meetings at the Galen Center earlier in the year.
Washington State (8-13, 4-6          Pac-12) is coming off two big wins last week against Arizona State and Arizona. The team is led by freshman guard Lia Galdeira, who is averaging 14.7 points and 5.2 rebounds per game.
In their first meeting on Jan. 13, the Women of Troy took Washington State down to the wire. Tied at 59 with just four seconds left, Crook was fouled and knocked down two clutch free throws to take down the Cougars, 61-59. With the win, the Trojans improved to 4-0 in Pac-12 play — their best start since the 2004-05 season.
Since that emotional win, the Trojans have struggled to find their groove, losing five out of their last six games and dropping to the middle of the pack in the conference, as they enter the second half of Pac-12 play.
“Going on the road, these two games are going to be very important for us,” Harberts said. “I feel that if we come out and play not only one but two good halves of basketball, we should be able to come out on top.”
The Washington Huskies               (16-5, 8-2) are currently on a six-game winning streak after also taking down the Arizona schools last week. They defeated Arizona 74-65 and Arizona State 74-61. If the Trojans are going to stop one player, it needs to be Jazmine Davis, who had 37 points in their last meeting. Davis is the Huskies’ top scorer with 19.8 points per game.
“She’s definitely a scorer, but if she scores 45 or so points and we still win the game, I’ll be fine with that,” Cooper said. “However, we are definitely going to put up a better defensive front up against her.”
Washington received votes in the AP poll this week, but is currently unranked. In their first meeting on Jan. 11, USC rolled over the Huskies 81-72, putting up a season-high in points. Four players finished in double figures.
USC-WSU is scheduled to start at 6 p.m. on Friday, while USC-UW is on tap for a 1 p.m. matinee.

As if signing day wasn’t annoying enough for the Trojans.
The Los Angeles Times reported Wednesday that redshirt freshman tight end Junior Pomee was recently arrested and now faces felony charges of burglary, possession of stolen goods and grand theft. He was found passed out at The Row with a plethora of electronics on him.
Really?
Pomee “was charged with five felony counts, including burglary, grand theft and three counts of receiving stolen goods including an iPad, an iPad Mini and an iPhone 5,” according to the article.
I read a comment in the story about Pomee that said something to the effect of, “Wow, a USC player gets arrested? That’s surprising.” And that got me thinking.
Last year, fellow columnist Joey Kaufman wrote about the arrest of basketball player Ari Stewart when he was busted with marijuana. He talked about then-USC head coach Kevin O’Neill and how one of the main reasons he was kept around despite a poor season was because of his ability to keep players clean. I agreed. I really liked O’Neill. He’s a good guy and a pretty good coach, honestly. And minus the Stewart issue, he kept the program out of trouble.
So where does this leave Lane Kiffin, then?
Now, I’ve been hard on Lane. I’ll be the first to admit it that I haven’t always liked the job he’s done. On the whole, however, his program has stayed out of trouble. There haven’t been major scandals dealing with players. The deflated ball scandal is another story, as was the Cody Kessler jersey scandal. But when it comes down to it, Lane has done a pretty decent job keeping his players in check.
Now, Kiffin is facing a crossroads of sorts: A lot of people want his head after USC’s 7-6 record in 2012. Recruiting didn’t go too well on Wednesday, despite the high-caliber recruits, because they lost some key athletes to UCLA and Notre Dame. Pomee’s situation does not make Lane look any better.
But at the end of the day, I really can’t fault Kiffin here. He didn’t steal the iPads. He didn’t get charged with grand theft. A coach can preach all he wants about the need to stay clean. Kiffin has probably told his players to stay out of trouble. But he can only do so much. He can’t be everywhere at once. Dealing with 75 high-quality Division I athletes from varied backgrounds is difficult. All the players aren’t going to be in the same place at the same time every weekend. Kiffin can’t keep tabs on them 24/7. And we really shouldn’t expect him to.
Kiffin has coached players who have done great things in the community that should be praised. Matt Barkley, T.J. McDonald and Robert Woods all went on                      a well-documented trip to Haiti to help the less fortunate last year. For all the negativity surrounding Kiffin, he has as many, if not more, players who have their heads on straight. For every Pomee incident, there have been three players doing community service and making positive impacts. Kiffin might not be the world’s best coach, but, for the most part, his players don’t make off-the-field mistakes.
Pomee’s problems off the field do not fall solely on Kiffin. Despite what you might think of him as a coach, this was Pomee’s issue and Pomee’s only. If Kiffin had stolen an iPhone 5, then that would be his fault. But he didn’t. His job is to coach a winning team and to lead young men. He is supposed to keep these guys in line. And except for this slip-up, he’s done a fabulous job. There comes a point when Pomee has to be held responsible for his actions and his crimes. Kiffin can only do so much.

Though losing is not a common theme for USC’s sports teams, it’s even harder to swallow for the men’s volleyball team, which has followed up its 2012 championship appearance with three straight losses and a 2-4 record.
Nonetheless, the Trojans will look to shake off their slump Friday night as they take on Long Beach State to try to salvage a victory from their three-game road trip.
Tough times · Sophomore Robert Feathers and the Trojans have dropped matches to UCSD, Pacific, Pepperdine and Cal State Northridge. – Ralf Cheung | Daily Trojan
After a 2-1 start that saw USC avenge their finals loss to 2012 champion UC Irvine, the Trojans have dropped three straight games by a 3-1 score. Following a loss to Pacific to end the homestand, the team failed to establish momentum en route to losses against Pepperdine and then Cal State Northridge on Monday and Wednesday night.
“There’s been some bad and there’s been some good,” USC head coach Bill Ferguson said. “Our digging has got to be better. That’s our hallmark and we’re typically one of the better digging teams in the country. Our blocking has been fantastic, so we just need to settle down our offense a bit.”
Before the match against Pepperdine, Ferguson wanted to see more impactful performances from various players, including redshirt junior opposite Tanner Jansen and redshirt freshman outside hitter Austin Rysyk. Indeed, those two powered the offensive attack against the Waves, as Jansen notched a team-leading 16 kills, while Rysyk chipped in 10 of his own. With the exception of blocking, however, Pepperdine edged USC in digs (28-22), service aces (8 to 5) and attacking percentage (.255 to .208), all of which contributed to the decisive victory (23-25, 18-25, 27-25, 22-25).
“We did some very good things; we blocked very well,” Ferguson said. “Unfortunately, we didn’t do so well on defense on the back row. We had a real solid match from Tanner Jansen, which helped spread out our offense and helped the left-side attackers a little bit. We got key blocking from [sophomore] middle blocker Ben Lam.”
Jansen enjoyed a field day against Cal State Northridge, recording a career-high 24 kills to pace the Trojan attack, but it wasn’t enough, as the hosts pulled away with a 25-17, 18-25, 25-21, 25-22 victory. The Trojans hit well at .324 (with Jansen reaching .475) but the defense failed to contain the Matadors, who hit .471 on the strength of 40 kills between opposite hitters John Baker and Brandon Lebrock.
While the losses are tough to swallow for a team that registered just seven total losses last season, Ferguson stressed the need to continue improving and making any lineup changes that would benefit the team.
“We’re going to try to solidify who’s going to play on the left side for us,” Ferguson said. “Rysyk played well against Pepperdine and [sophomore outside hitter] Cristian Rivera has come in and done well. We need more production from our pin attackers on the left side. As far as the match is concerned, Long Beach State has great fan support and is playing some of the best volleyball in the country, so we’re going to take things day by day and refine what we do.”
Following the match against the 49ers, the Trojans will return to the Galen Center for a four-game homestand, starting with a match against Cal-Baptist Wednesday night at 7 p.m.

The Trojans face two highly ranked teams from the north this weekend when they play host to Cal and Stanford, respectively. The action gets underway Friday at 1:30 p.m. when the No. 2-ranked Trojans face the No. 13 Bears at Marks Stadium, with the second game against the      No. 18-ranked Cardinal on Saturday.
Rock-solid start · Sophomore Yannick Hanfmann (above) and the USC men’s tennis team have yet to lose a game this season as they make a run at a fifth straight national championship trophy. – Ralf Cheung | Daily Trojan
Cal is 3-0 this season in Intercollegiate Tennis Association play and is led by senior Christoffer Konigsfeldt, ranked No. 42 in singles. Konigsfeldt missed Cal’s previous 5-2 victory over Pacific last weekend as he represented his native Denmark in the Davis Cup. Freshman Mads Engsted, ranked No. 93 in singles, might see a familiar foe in Trojan sophomore Roberto Quiroz. Engsted and Quiroz met in the Sherwood Collegiate Cup earlier this year, and the match went the full three sets — including a tiebreak — with Quiroz emerging victorious, 5-7, 6-2, 7-6(4).
The team is aware that a keener focus is necessary when facing conference opponents such as Cal and Stanford. USC head coach Peter Smith emphasized the importance of strong preparation in facing Pac-12 teams.
“It’s time to get it going,” Smith said. “We had three matches over the weekend, and the goal was to get seven matches in before we play a top-20 team.”
Despite having played a multitude of matches including two doubleheaders, the Trojans haven’t faced much adversity on the road to Pac-12 play. In four of their seven matches, the Trojans didn’t drop a single match. When asked how he felt about the team’s preparation in spite of the seeming lack of a visible challenge, Smith insisted that he felt the team was “very prepared.”
“We’re right there; we’re right where we want to be,” Smith said.
In contrast to the Trojans, the Cardinal have faced plenty of adversity to open the season, dropping matches to No. 26 Texas A&M and TCU at home. The Stanford men’s tennis team is 3-2 on the season and the schedule only gets progressively tougher for them entering the National Team Indoor Intercollegiate championships, with a match against No. 3 UCLA on Friday before facing No. 2 USC on Saturday.
The Cardinal are led by sophomore John Morrissey, ranked No. 39 in the nation. It was Trojan sophomore Eric Johnson who knocked out Morrissey at the Sherwood Collegiate Cup with a 6-3, 6-3 victory in the second round. The results earlier this year might give the Trojans confidence in their game plan, but the team remains on guard.
“Cal and Stanford are obviously two very good teams,” sophomore Jonny Wang said. “You can never take anything for granted. The Pac-12 is one of, if not the strongest conference in the nation. Having so many ranked teams means any match between these teams are going to be tightly contested.”
Junior Ray Sarmiento will return to the lineup after playing only one leg of the two matches last Sunday. Sarmiento felt that the team didn’t need to do anything differently to prepare for its opponents.
“We’re just going to keep working hard and get our bodies ready,” Sarmiento said.
Sarmiento has played out of his usual No. 1 position at times this season with junior Emilio Gomez filling in aptly in his stead. When asked if he would retake his No. 1 position with the beginning of           Pac-12 play, Sarmiento was gracious in his response.
“It doesn’t matter, I mean, we’re all playing well,” Sarmiento said, citing Gomez’s success in particular.
Gomez picked up Pac-12 player of the week honors for his play at the No. 1 spot last week. This week, the honor went to another Trojan, freshman Max de Vroome.
De Vroome secured five straight doubles wins with partner Quiroz and five straight set match victories last week, including the thrilling clincher against No. 16 Texas, which saw de Vroome fight back from behind in both sets to win the match in tiebreaks.

Though more than a third of the country was busy watching the Super Bowl (or at least the commercials) last weekend, a sizable audience was willing to see a zombie try to fall in love.
Barely anyone, though, wanted to see Sylvester Stallone shooting up criminals in Bullet to the Head. You’d think Stallone would make for some easy marketing for a New Orleans-based movie during a New Orleans-based sports event, but that’s probably giving him too much credit.
But the rebound that the industry has been looking for might happen this weekend. The weekend before Valentine’s Day has been a good launching pad for genre films that might not necessarily be the top choice for couples on V-Day but the best choice for their respective release dates.
Last year was one of the biggest February weekends of all time, with both The Vow and Safe House opening at more than $40 million and Journey 2: The Mysterious Island bringing in the family audiences. This year, though, doesn’t quite have the same pedigree with the releases of comedy Identity Thief and Steven Soderbergh’s Side Effects.
Identity Thief, which was originally scheduled for a summer release but was moved back to avoid competing with Iron Man 3 and Star Trek Into Darkness, is the latest film from Seth Gordon, the director of Horrible Bosses and Four Christmases. This film unites him with Bosses star Jason Bateman and Melissa McCarthy in her first starring role since her breakout role in Bridesmaids. She’ll also be starring alongside Sandra Bullock in The Heat this summer, so this might end up being a big year for her.
The plot involves one man who has to join forces with the woman who steals his identity and has been wrecking havoc on his credit rating and social standing. It’s certainly a trendy take on the “anti-buddy” comedy genre, and though the trailers have been pretty funny, one wouldn’t exactly say that it’s going to be a comedic event like Horrible Bosses turned out to be.
What that film has going for it is its unique stunt casting, such as Jennifer Aniston as a diabolical sex bomb or Colin Farrel as a balding, cocaine-sniffing despot. Here, both of the actors are playing mostly to type, with Bateman once again playing a straight-collared guy caught up in a crazy predicament.
Though Bateman is known for that and has made a career out of it, it hasn’t always worked for him at the box office. In the same summer that Horrible Bosses came out, The Change-Up bombed just a month afterward.
The secret weapon here is McCarthy, who hasn’t had this prominent of a role yet. There’s plenty of people that still laugh from her performance in Bridesmaids, not to mention the CBS TV series Mike and Molly, so people might check this film out just for her.
There really hasn’t been a straight-up comedy at the box office in a while (well, one that wasn’t a complete catastrophe like Movie 43), so there’s an audience craving a good laugh. A lower-$20 million opening is most likely.
The other new release is Side Effects. Soderbergh, who claims he will be retiring after this feature, has been directing like a storm lately. This feature will mark his fourth film in a 15-month period, with 2011’s Contagion, 2012’s Haywire and the breakout hit of the summer, Magic Mike.
This one has a bit more intrigue than male strippers (and that sound you hear is millions of women disappointed with that news). Side Effects, written by Scott Z. Burns and starring Jude Law, Rooney Mara, Catherine Zeta-Jones and Channing Tatum, is a drama-thriller showing the ramifications of a new prescription drug and the domino effect it has on the people closest to it.
Though the trailer certainly seems compelling, the mystery behind the side effects of the drug is legitimately confusing. It’s difficult to describe to a passerby what the film is actually about or what’s at stake, even if you’ve been following the film.
The film does have a strong cast behind it, not to mention this is the first film that Mara has been in since her Oscar-nominated turn as Lisbeth Salander in The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo, but the indecipherable plot as shown in the trailer and the advertisements might be too dense for most people.
An opening in the $10- to $15-million range should be seen as a victory — especially since Soderbergh has kept his recent films on such a tight budget — but it wouldn’t be shocking to see it gross under $10 million. Whether or not this is truly his last film, there is a part of me that wishes the acclaimed director will be able to finish his career on a positive note. Regardless, though, this might not be the most stellar weekend for the box office, but if you’re craving a couple of star-studded films, a trip to the movies might be necessary.

Xiayi “Shirley” Zhang lives four minutes from the heart of Central Plaza in Los Angeles’ Chinatown. Over a plate of pad see ew and a coconut at Via Café, a Vietnamese restaurant tucked into the historic plaza, she explained that she moved to Chinatown in 2007 after leaving USC because her Chinese heritage is important to her.

Since that time, Zhang joined the Chinatown Business Improvement District, a group working to let others see how what Zhang already knows: that Chinatown today is not only culturally relevant, but also hip and vivacious.
And to do just that, the group has some special features planned for this year’s Chinese New Year Festival, which celebrates the Year of the Snake.
The biggest party of the year in Chinatown will begin on Saturday, Feb. 16 and run throughout the weekend. The festival has something to stimulate all of the senses, starting with touch: Chinatown will attempt to break the previous world record for the largest modular origami piece, which was made using nearly 60,000 units. Zhang said the committee came up with the idea as a way to make the weekend memorable and also to unify participants. Everyone at the festival is encouraged to participate: There will be paper and instructions to go along with the setup so that people of all ages can join the festivities and help out.
Attendees will make the modular origami into the shape of a snake to honor this year, the year of the snake. The goal is to use 80,000 units because eight is a lucky number in Chinese culture.
“What better way to start the New Year than with a new world record?” Zhang said.
The festival has also planned many visual elements to excite the eyes, including the 114th annual Golden Dragon Parade, which will feature Los Angeles Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa and Los Angeles Police Department Chief Charlie Beck as grand marshals and the new Miss Chinatown with her court on the floats.
After the parade, there will be cultural performances at Central Plaza, including some of the best acrobats and contortionists in America in addition to juggling and ribbon dancing.
It won’t be hard to hear the auditory element, as LA Weekly will sponsor a live music stage that will feature various indie bands and a singing competition.
As for tastes and smells, all the self-proclaimed foodies can grab a bite from food trucks such as Kogi Korean BBQ, deemed “the godfather of food trucks,” Zhang said. Seoul Sausage, which won the Great Food Truck Race, will also be present to serve fusion Asian cuisine. There will also be a craft beer garden that will feature only local breweries such as Eagle Rock Brewery, Angel City and Monkfish Brewing Co.
With all these events, Zhang hopes to increase public awareness of the amenities that Chinatown has to offer so that Chinatown can reach its full potential and thus feel more alive.
“It’s something that I live and breathe everyday,” Zhang said. “There’s a lot of unutilized space in Chinatown that I would love to see developed. I would like to see Chinatown open later at night, and see more vitality in the community.”
Zhang is not the only one excited about revitalizing Chinatown. Many residents of Chinatown feel the same way. Osceola Refetoff, a Montreal native, has been living in his studio apartment right in the heart of Chinatown for about a little over year. Refetoff said he regrets that more young residents don’t move to Chinatown.
“[It has a] vivacious spirit and unique architectural charm,” Refetoff said. “[It’s a] unique opportunity to live on a walking street so close to downtown, yet [it’s] so quiet with a small-town feel.”
There’s a lot to offer in this small corner of Downtown Los Angeles, from its culture, historical significance and amenities. This year’s Chinese New Year Festival could prove to be the perfect leap that Chinatown needs to really showcase the vitality it offers Los Angeles.
“Chinatown’s an experience, and it’s meant to be shared,” Zhang said.

Though the Massman Theatre stage might be smaller than a typical stage used for a show as big as Chicago, director Shaya Mulcahy and producers Manuel Prieto and Patrick Phillips manage to make the space work for student run production.
All that jazz· Seniors Lexie Lowell (Roxy Hart) and William McGarey (Billy Flynn) make crime cool in the Cardinal Theatre Productions’ Chicago. The actors show their versatility with multiple song and dance numbers. – Sarah Wu | Daily Trojan
The Independent Student Production was brought to life by Cardinal Theatre Productions, an organization founded and managed by students.
In the musical, the orchestra proves itself right away as being perfectly capable of following the intricate score with great accuracy and intensity. Large numbers such as “We Both Reached for the Gun,” which includes extreme tempo changes, are no problem for the pros in the pit, who, aside from the percussionist, are spread out on an elevated platform hanging above the action upstage.
The stage itself, however, is not elevated — it leaves the front row of the audience on the same level as the actors. The acting space noticeably lacks many other significant levels, but the small cast uses vivid movements and clever blocking — to avoid too many actors from standing or sitting at the same height; this markedly provides much-needed variation to enhance the show’s aesthetic appeal.
Not only are the lead actors generally well-rounded and dynamic, but the talent also extends into the chorus members. In group numbers such as the final courtroom scene and “Velma Takes the Stage,” the actors on the margins of the scene often seize more attention than those singing the solos — but in a good way, of course.
Freshmen ensemble members Kevin Paley and Henry Boyd are particularly pleasing to watch in the background of a scene. Their ability to stay focused on their performances at times when the leads naturally attract the audience’s attention — a task more difficult than one might think — creates very special moments in which everyone on stage seems completely drawn into the world of the story. This commitment really lets viewers completely immerse themselves in the production.
At the end of the day, though, it is the leads that shine. Ian Shain, who plays the innocently dimwitted Amos, gives his character an unexpected complexity. He moves between innocently stammering with big eyes and rounded shoulders to shouting angrily and excitedly with rapid, violent gestures — all within his classic musical theatre number, “Mr. Cellophane.” Shain’s versatility nurtures his character’s changing mental state and provides for a genuine performance.
The character of Amos, however, only succeeds because of the opposing force that is his wife, Roxie, fashionably portrayed by Lexie Lowell. Though the duo’s comedically imbalanced relationship has the tendency to get lost in the fast-paced storyline, thanks to the pair’s mastery-level acting they were able to make it work.
But where the production excels in performance, it lacks in some areas of production design. Costumes are kept to a bare minimum, with most of the actors wearing the same outfit when portraying different characters. Set pieces are also sparse; a table was the largest prop onstage.
Nevertheless, the simplicity of the stage design does not detract from the show’s effectiveness in maintaining its imaginative universe, where lawyers and murderers can sing and dance with impressive joviality, as they do in the twisted courtroom extravaganza “Razzle Dazzle.”
Such creativity is everywhere in the acclaimed script of Chicago, which is structured as a story told within the frame of a vaudeville-esque nightclub performance and therefore demands that a narrator introduce certain songs. This production made the interesting choice of having the conductor of the orchestra be the narrator. This unique decision enhances the realism of the event by further intertwining reality with the surrealism of the show.
And the script offers opportunities for ensemble members to shine: Another standout chorus member is the talented vocalist Nisha Balsara, who plays the Hungarian murderess in the girls’ ensemble number “Cell Block Tango.” Her voice is clear and strong in her singing and her dialogue, which is also performed in fluent Hungarian. Making full use of the talents of its student creators, the production also utilizes Balsara’s choreography skills in her dance number.
The rest of the cast does a great job as well. Will McGarey performs a greedy Billy Flynn much like a suave Don Draper would in his opening striptease “All I Care About.” He croons his way through the night and contributes an excellent complement to his female co-stars’ raspy jazz singing.
Another of these wonderful belters is Meghan Mahowald, who plays Mama, the prison matriarch. Mahowald’s performance refreshes with a deeply resonating voice that contrasts with her female counterparts.
The dimly-lit number “Roxie” stands as an example of all of the best aspects of the production. Lowell’s feisty Roxie character embodies the spirit of the show, and the wonderful male ensemble carries her to full fruition with their winning smiles, quick feet and truly spectacular voices.
 
Chicago runs through the weekend, and rush tickets are available at the door.

C’mon.
The immature grammar, syntax, and word choice are only the beginning of the author’s inability to write a decent article. All personal opinions aside, several of the facts are incorrect, including the caption on the picture and the complete omission of both the choreographer, Ariel Improta, and the lead, Velma Kelly, played by Brenna Bloom. In addition, the author’s lack of knowledge concerning both costumes and set production design in any musical, let alone an ISP in a black box theatre, is embarrassing. Throughout a musical, the ensemble often remains in the same costume. In the Broadway production of Chicago, Roxie Hart did not change her costume at all. In this production of Chicago, Roxie Hart, played by Lexie Lowell, had four different costumes, not including several small details that were added depending on the scene.  The set design was very complex for an ISP in a black box theatre, and incorporated design elements that other ISPs could not hope to afford, such as the extensive tressing and lighting elements. The lighting contained hundreds of cues, more than many professional productions. The production team managed to fit a live band smoothly into the set design, incorporating them seamlessly into the performance without impeding the actors. Clearly, this author is uneducated on the production design of any musical, and should therefore refrain from reporting on them.
I thought it was extremely creative the way they used lighting in this musical. It was beyond what the current production on broadway uses. I wonder why the reviewer did not mention a performance schedule, ticket prices and address of theater. I had to find it via google. Also, I saw this production and the photo captioned as “all that jazz” is not from the number. Did the writer even see the show?
I seriously doubt that the author of this article has ever seen a piece of theatre before. “But where the production excels in performance, it lacks in some areas of production design. Costumes are kept to a bare minimum, with most of the actors wearing the same outfit when portraying different characters. Set pieces are also sparse; a table was the largest prop onstage.” Really? It’s a dance heavy show in a black box; what more do you want on stage? The costumes were brilliant and it’s not uncommon for ensemble members to keep the same costume throughout a show. Chicago’s production and tech was among the most complicated and well executed I’ve ever seen at USC and this article doesn’t even come close to doing it justice.
Shaya Mulcahy is the director and Manuel Prieto and Patrick Phillips are the producers. You also forgot to mention the lead, Brenna Bloom, who plays Velma and the very talented choreographer of EVERY DANCE NUMBER, Ariel Improta.

Thank you for your concern with after-hours health care in the Engemann Student Health Center. We have increased our hours in recent years to provide seven-day-a-week coverage during the academic year as well as extended hours in the evening Monday to Thursday.
We have an on-call triage service 24/7 when we are closed as well as a physician and counselor on backup call for that service. However, when emergencies occur in the middle of the night and the issue cannot wait until the next morning, it is better to be in an emergency room, and one should call 911. It would be prohibitively expensive to adequately staff our health center 24/7 with the services, support and security needed for emergency cases for the hours suggested. In addition, the student health center is not equipped to handle severe traumatic injuries or illnesses. The cost of such an intervention would significantly impact the services we provide every day of the week. It would require a large increase in the student health fee or significant charges for services now covered under the health fee.  We have worked hard to provide excellent services and supplemental health insurance at a combined cost that is better than the vast majority of our peer universities.
We are in the process of updating all information in our phone system and on our webpage. We are always open to suggestions that will help us improve or correct the information provided. We also have implemented a new call center that has vastly improved the response to students who call in for assistance and appointments.
Each year the student health center has approximately 90,000 patient encounters, processes about 50,000 laboratory tests and 5,500 X-rays and serves our campus community through our Office of Wellness and Health Promotion.  Overall, our approval ratings from students are very good (95 – 96 percent positive approval ratings). We have strong quality assurance protocols and programs that help us identify ways to improve our services and promote activities that help students enhance their health. I sincerely appreciate letters like these as they bring matters to our attention that we can examine and continue to problem-solve.
Thank you for your feedback and please do not hesitate to contact me directly with any other concerns you would like me and our staff to review. Please note that our website  www.usc.edu/engemann has a button at the bottom for providing feedback to us.
 
Larry Neinstein M.D.
Executive Director of Engemann Student Health Center
Professor of Pediatrics and Medicine
How about an opt-out from your ridiculous and as-yet-unused student health fee? It’s bad enough having to jump through hoops to submit an insurance waiver. Because I have a real doctor I’m subsidizing the services that you provide to those who don’t. It’s pretty annoying.

Two decades since gun violence erupted on the scene at the USC Medical Center in 1993, Los Angeles County has decided to move on from the incident by planning to remove metal detectors and scanners from many major medical centers by the beginning of this summer.
According to the Los Angeles Times, L.A. County plans to remove 26 more metal detectors by June 30. With this move, it seems that commercial interests are becoming more of a concern that the issue of safety. And the removal of these security measures, prompted by the 1993 incident that left three wounded,  is a bit of a scary step — especially since there isn’t even a back-up plan.
Though the metal detector system might not be great, there’s no reason to scrap it. Until there is a new system in check, it is best to keep preexisting safety measures, especially for a sense of reassurance in a time warped by the issue of violence in public areas nationwide.
Walking through a metal detector in order to enter a hospital might not initially give off the most welcoming of auras, and might even suggest that the hospital could be unsafe, even dangerous. But unfortunately, this is now the world that we live in. Even hospitals — havens of hope and recovery — aren’t as safe as people like to think.
Hospitals, as welcoming as we want them to be, have to make safety a genuine priority, and if that safety can be found in metal detectors — the best that can be offered as of now — so be it.
This proposal to remove more metal detectors is creating quite an uproar from both sides; some hospital personnel say that taking away the detectors creates a more inviting atmosphere in hospitals, while others just don’t feel safe without it because, after all, just because it’s a hospital doesn’t mean that violence with weapons can’t happen there.
It’s not just the perceived intrusiveness of metal detectors and other safety equipment that some hospitals appear to be concerned about but rather, in an ironically selfish way, their financial interests, which hinge on getting people through the doors. What’s more ironic is that the force behind this new competitive nature between medical centers is the Obama administration’s healthcare overhaul, according to the L.A. Times. The plan to help those in need of affordable medical services is indirectly causing the county to take down security measures that have been in place for a reason, though that impetus arose two decades ago. By creating an increasingly competitive marketplace, the new healthcare system inadvertently increases danger. Safety cannot be compromised, especially not to give way to the forces of commerce.
Those who remember the 1993 incident are wary of removing the detectors, a system that probably could have prevented the entire episode, according to the L.A. Times. We owe it to those who have been hurt in gun-related incidents to keep up this current security system unless another, better plan is ready to take its place. As of now, metal detectors are the strongest bet that hospitals have against dangerous weapons making it inside.
Supporters of the removal have cited an Annals of Emergency Medicine study in September 2012 that “found hospital shootings [to be] rare” and “typically involve a ‘determined shooter,’” but it’s simply worth it to be prepared or have some sort of preparation for those “rare” moments, because, as they always say, it’s better to be safe than sorry.
Granted, metal detectors are not the best way to close all the loopholes in ensuring security — not just at hospitals, but anywhere, whether it’s the airport or important government buildings. However, hospitals are places where lives are saved, and people ought to benefit from the best security possible. Even if the technology can’t catch every determined criminal, at least there is a bit of assurance to cling to.
Sometimes, that might just be enough; the sense of being secure makes a world of difference.
Until there’s a better system in place — which won’t be soon, seeing that America’s still on the fence on what to do about gun violence in the nation — L.A. County should not act so quickly without deliberation on what’s ahead and if the safety alternatives it has in mind will be any better.
