Among the many political discussions on campus was the USC Students for the Justice of Palestine’s event “Poetic Injustice: Writings on Resistance and Palestine” Wednesday evening. The event featured Remi Kanazi, a Palestinian-American activist and author who speaks and writes about Israeli-Palestinian relations and some of the issues taking place in the region. 
The event began with an introduction from Yuonf Irshaad and Aliza Khan, co-presidents of the Students for the Justice of Palestine. 
The first part of the event was a brief discussion on American politics and the current state of affairs, given the election victory from President-elect Donald Trump. When asked about how not to feel discouraged and how to continue to make positive social change despite the political outcomes that may take place in the future, Kanazi emphasized the importance of the various social justice groups coming together and working toward a common goal. 
“Things are more intersectional than ever before. We must double our efforts and come together as a community,” he said. 
Kanazi discussed the importance of making change on a grassroots level.
“Local politics matter, local fights matter,” Kanazi said. “There is power in local fronts.” 
Despite what happens, Kanazi said he has hope for this generation and what can be achieved in the next couple of years. 
“As bad as things are, I’m looking forward to the future,” Kanazi said. “I’m excited to see what the younger folk will do for the future.” 
Following the discussion, he recited some of his poetry from his book Poetic Injustice: Writings on Resistance and Palestine. The poems covered a variety of topics, ranging from the Israeli-American relations and how that affects Palestine, to other major social issues taking place around the world. 
The first poem was called “Nothing to Worry About” and discussed his views on how many people turn a blind eye on major racial and social justice issues in the United States and across the world, such as racist drug laws and unfair prison systems. 
“You put on your noise-canceling headphones to block out the sounds of the ambulances,” he said, a line from the poem.
The poems that followed discussed U.S.-Israeli relations, his beliefs on the power of divestment, and Palestinian-Israel Normalization programs that took place in the ’90s. He closed with a collection of poems that focused on the the use of social media and activism. Kanazi said that though using social media to make progress is important, it is just the beginning and actual work should be put in to make progress. 
“Twitter never has been and never will be the start of a revolution. Activism has to extend beyond 140 characters,” he said, reciting from his poem, “Dear Twitter Revolutionary: You Are Not That Badass.” 
One of the ways he urged students to make this change is by joining on-campus social justice groups and movements. 
“You don’t want to write a status to get likes; you need to make actual change. Whatever issue drives you really does matter,” Kanazi said. “We will never get to a perfect world, but we can at least get to a better place.”

Hailing from Boston, two young DJs came together in 2001 to revolutionize a genre of music in a way no one had thought possible. This duo, Soul Clap, comprises of musical tastemakers Charlie Levine and Eli Goldstein. Since their inception, Soul Clap has released a series of mixtapes, singles, EP’s and albums that showcase a unique fusion of house and funk music. 
More recently, the duo has been touring internationally to share their eponymous second studio album, Soul Clap. In an interview with the Daily Trojan, Soul Clap spoke about their career and anticipation for their upcoming performance on Friday at Los Globos.
Daily Trojan: You guys are on tour right now promoting your new album. Can you tell me about that experience so far?
Soul Clap: We started out in Europe for most of October and had some great gigs. Then we hit Berlin, London, Milan, Amsterdam, and Oslo. We also went to Stockholm for the first time on this tour which was really cool. Now we’re back in North America. Last weekend, we did Montreal, D.C. and Miami and we are heading up to the West Coast on Thursday. It’s been a lot of of running around. Overall, this tour has been really exciting for us because we are doing a lot of live performances where we get to play music from the new album, which is more fun than our usual DJ sets. 
DT: What was the process of creating this new album like?
SC: We started with jam sessions in Tallahassee at George Clinton’s P-Funk Studio and we were jamming there when we got the invitation to collaborate with him. So that was where it all started, which was about three years ago. Then over the next three years, we pulled our music together. We worked out some ideas here in Brooklyn and then it all came together in Barcelona earlier this year where we just went straight into the studio. It was a long and location-filled process. 
DT: What was it like working with singer George Clinton?
SC: First and foremost, he gave us a new confidence in our music. To have that sign off from the godfather of funky music … was really amazing. He welcomed us in and we met his family and all of these musicians and the people who work with them and are close with them. That has been amazing for us personally and musically. Also just watching George work was so inspirational. He’s got a crazy work ethic even in his 70s. He has tireless energy and a vision for how music is supposed to sound that inspires him to put sounds together in a way other people wouldn’t think of. 
DT: Can you tell me about how Soul Clap got started?
SC: We met in high school in Boston. A mutual friend introduced us because we were both DJing. There weren’t too many DJs back then so that was a huge connection. We also shared a lot of musical tastes and loved going to raves. So it was exciting to meet someone who was in a similar situation, and we decided to start making music. 
DT: What were some of your early influences and do you still find yourself going back to that same type of music for inspiration?
SC: There is actually an album we were listening to last night called Timeless by Goldie. It had a huge influence on us then and is something that both of us listen to this day. We’ve actually sampled that album before. On top of that we are influenced by so many different styles from hip hop, to jazz, to drum and bass to house. Back when we started, there was this culture of rave music back then that DJ Dan was creating and that was a huge inspiration for us. But one thing that has never changed is that we’ve always been influenced by a wide range of music. It isn’t just one genre or style or tempo. 
DT: Do you guys have a dream collaborator you hope to work with in the future?
SC: We would actually love to work with R. Kelly. He’s been an inspiration to us. I know he’s a complicated character, but musically he’s such a genius. And there are some other, younger DJs and artists that would be exciting to work with. Kaytranada is someone that we love and would be dope to collaborate with. Other old school people like CeCe Peniston, who sings that song “Finally” from the 90s, would be amazing. 
DT: What’s next for you guys after the tour?
SC: We will definitely keep writing music. We have a lot of cool opportunities in the upcoming year. There’s a record label called Classic from the United Kingdom, which has been around for a long time and we are going to be doing stuff with them. We are also going to put out some more remixes. We are really excited to create and share a lot of new music in the coming year because it took so long to make two albums so now we are really motivated. 
DT: Do you guys have any advice for kids that are trying to become DJs?
SC: The best advice we have to give is to find a unique voice for yourself. You have to be inspired to do something original and that is really you. Otherwise, there’s no point because there are so many DJs out there trying to do the same exact thing. If you’re going to play the same song that someone else is playing then go stay home. So with that, if you have a desire to make music and think you have unique voice then cultivate it. Take your vision and try to share it with the world. 
DT: So what was the process of finding the voice of Soul Clap like?
SC: We had a lot of mentors from the older generation that taught us about producery [sic]. The best resource for young people are all of the books out now that talk about producers and the history of raves and disco. It’s a good idea to just figure out where it all came from because it is invaluable to know the history in order to have a perspective. There is so much sampling going on even on modern songs with records from the past; and it’s a huge advantage to understand the sounds. That’s why we would also say try and listen to as much music as possible. 
DT: You guys have a performance coming up in Los Angeles soon at Los Globos. What can people expect from your live show?
SC: It’s going to be hella lit! It’s really going to be great. At Los Globos, we are going to be playing all night so we can really take you on a journey and get your body moving. The idea is to get your mind working and your body moving. 
Soul Clap will perform at Los Globos on Nov. 11.

Leonardo DiCaprio’s venture around the world in an effort to expose the disastrous effects of climate change in the National Geographic documentary, is commendable. In the documentary, Before The Flood, DiCaprio spoke with locals, professionals and powerful leaders such as Barack Obama and Pope Francis. Throughout his trip, DiCaprio witnessed firsthand the industrial pollution in Beijing, the clear cut ancient boreal forests in Canada, the incinerated rainforests in Indonesia and the rapidly melting glaciers in the Arctic.
DiCaprio’s passion for immediate change was inspiring. However, his sense of urgency was offset by a failure to probe further beneath the surface. At the end of the documentary, I couldn’t help but ask myself how exactly I was supposed to enact change for the environment. I was waiting for his recognition of animal agriculture as the top contributor of climate change. 
My lack of clarity wasn’t misguided. Instead, it was a result of DiCaprio’s repeated confirmation of the evident problems followed by a doom-and-gloom phrased question. For instance, DiCaprio declared that the U.S. was the greatest emitter of greenhouse gas throughout history and how vital it was for people to help the developing world transition before it would be too late. This statement was then followed by “So, how do we fix this?” 
Similarly, when discussing electrification all over the world, DiCaprio said our energy sources needed to be “different.” He ended with the question, “How can we possibly turn this all around?”
Halfway through the film, with no concrete, enactable solutions, I frankly became frustrated. DiCaprio’s apprehensive stares into the distance, though poignant, were well-suited for Hollywood, but not for the salvation of planet Earth. 
Instead of probing deeper into animal agriculture, DiCaprio continued to educate viewers about the pressing issues: the fossil fuel industry; collapse of the coral reefs; melting of the Arctic; rising sea levels; and the solutions: sustainable energy alternatives; the carbon tax; and voting for the right politicians (seems we’ve reached the point of no return now that climate change nonbeliever, Donald Trump is now president). DiCaprio should have continued to expand upon Eshel’s proposed social reforms. 
The ending frames, featuring consumer advice, says “It is up to all of us, consume differently, what you buy, what you eat,” a dramatic ending. While powerful in sentiment, DiCaprio would be sure to ignite change had he actually incited how to do it. 
First and foremost, make an effort to reduce your consumption of animal products. This includes both meat and dairy products, since the industries work in conjunction with one another and release the majority of greenhouse gas emissions. Although many of the products we buy have palm oil in them, the only way to dismantle these large industries that dig for oil at the expense of our ecosystem is to stop buying their products. Try to cut back on your purchase of processed foods, produced by companies such as Doritos, Quaker and Kraft, and instead make homemade meals with locally grown produce — you can buy these at USC’s weekly farmer’s market. Try to purchase your groceries from neighborhood grocery stores, such as Yummy.com Neighborhood Market, Lassens and Trader Joe’s. When I buy a stalk of kale, for instance, I’ll keep half of the stalk in the refrigerator for salads and the other half in the freezer for smoothies. I store my bananas, spinach and mangos similarly. Similarly, I buy non-perishable foods in bulk, like almond milk, rice, oatmeal and nuts. A large bag of oatmeal usually lasts me an entire semester. 
Now that we have the facts it is up to us to take action. While reducing your travel time, showers, food waste, trash and water usage are all great ways to lower your carbon footprint, nothing compares to the elimination of meat and dairy from your diet. Whatever step you take to get there is a step toward a grand solution for the reconstruction of our Earth, for its current inhabitants and for future generations. 
Tessa Nesis is a a sophomore majoring in NGOs and social change.  Her column, “The Sentient Bean,” runs on Thursdays. 
You realize the solution is simple yet complex, right? Stop burning fossil fuels but create renewable energy to support life throughout the world. We should’ve started 20 years ago. The facts have been there meaning the solution has been there as well.

This season, USC basketball might field its most talented roster since Tim Floyd’s 2006-2007 Sweet Sixteen team that featured the likes of Nick Young and Taj Gibson. While it may not make a deep run in the NCAA Tournament, USC could very well remain on the bubble for most of the season and could earn a middle seed like last year’s squad that finished .500 in Pac-12 play. However, this team has an extraordinary amount of young talent; its ceiling is limitless. The Men of Troy tip-off this pivotal season Friday night at 8 p.m. at the Galen Center against Montana.
Coach Andy Enfield enters his fourth year with the reins of the program, and he has a team built for his electric run-and-gun style of play. USC’s success will hinge upon the ability of underclassmen to execute his gameplan by exhibiting superior athleticism, 3-point shooting and pace without fouling in abundance or allowing excessive offensive rebounds — both of which were problems that plagued last year’s squad. 
USC returns a core of three starters from last year’s team that set school records in 3-point baskets (266) and blocked shots (215). First, junior guard and captain Jordan McLaughlin returns after having led the team in points per game (13.4) and finishing second in assists per game (4.7). A lot of pressure weighs upon McLaughlin’s finally healthy shoulders. He spent the last two offseasons nursing shoulder injuries, but this summer, he played in Australia with other Pac-12 student-athletes and also found time to work at Nike.
Junior guard Elijah Stewart (9.8 PPG), who led the team in 3-point shooting percentage (42.9 percent) should assume a starting role in the absence of Katin Reinhardt, who transferred to Marquette. As a recruit, Stewart was projected to become USC’s best guard, but inconsistent play during the last two seasons have left a lot of room for improvement. Despite USC’s impressive depth at guard, Stewart will have to play consistently better than last year if the team is to get back to the NCAA Tournament. 
Finally, sophomore forward Bennie Boatwright, who averaged double-digits (11.5 PPG) and was the  co-leader in 3-point baskets (60) also returns. At 6-foot-10, Boatwright played the three and the four last year, and he stretches the floor as well as anyone. However, to take his game to the next level this year and compensate for the loss of 6-foot-11 Nikola Jovanovic, Boatwright is going to have to defend the post, rebound and play more offense on the block. Though he lost a lot of this offseason to a hip injury, he recently got back to full strength and is in good spirits. 
“I feel like I’m a better player because of it,” he said. “I am working harder every day.”
These three returners will most likely start on Friday night along with a fourth: Sophomore forward Chimezie Metu. Metu showed flashes of brilliance last season with his domineering blocks, sky-high dunks and polished 18-footer. However, he only scored in double-digits six times last year en route to averaging just 6.4 points per game. Foul trouble kept Metu on the bench in many games. Thus, he only averaged 18 minutes per game in Pac-12 play, and in that time, he managed to garner 4.5 fouls per game — a remarkable feat that must go unrepeated. As a sophomore, expect Metu to exhibit more discipline. He is also much stronger. The 6-foot-11 forward entered college weighing 205 pounds, but this season he will play at 220 pounds. 
USC’s final starter will probably be redshirt sophomore Shaqquan Aaron, the 6-foot-7 guard who redshirted last year after transferring from Louisville. Aaron adds length to the backcourt. He is a premier perimeter defender and a shot creator. Without Julian Jacobs, the team’s consummate playmaker a season ago, USC will rely upon Aaron to handle the ball occasionally and create opportunities. 
Charles Buggs, a graduate transfer from Minnesota, will likely be the first big man off the bench and a crucial replacement to fill the void left by the big shoes of Jovanovic. At 6-foot-9 and 230 pounds, Buggs can stretch the floor. He shot 31.9 percent from distance last season for the Golden Gophers, but worked on his shot this offseason. Buggs is recovering from knee surgery, so his minutes could be limited in pre-conference play. 
In June, USC landed a third transfer in guard Derryck Thornton of Duke — the highest-rated transfer in the nation. He will have to sit out this year, but his experience as a starter at one of college basketball’s top programs will hopefully pervade USC’s culture and inspire the team.
Of the four freshmen, four-star recruits Jonah Mathews and De’Anthony Melton should contribute immediately. Both are excellent spot-up shooters and athletic defenders. Last year, Mathews averaged 24.1 points per game for Santa Monica High, leading his team to the CIF Southern Section 1A title. Getting off to a hot start this season is of paramount importance to Mathews.
“I want to come in a scorer and not be stagnant,” he said. “I want to set the tone as a freshman, looking forward to my next years here.” 
Meanwhile, Melton led Crespi High to back-to-back state championships while averaging 20.0 points, 9.3 rebounds, 4.3 assists, 3.5 steals and 1.2 blocks per game. His versatility makes him a threat to enter the starting rotation even before conference play begins. 
Three-star recruits Nick Rakocevic and Harrison Henderson — 6-foot-11 and 6-foot-10, respectively — could see significant minutes pending Buggs’ and Boatwright’s health and Metu’s foul problems. Rakocevic, a Chicago Tribune First-Team All-State selection last year in Illinois, sports an intrepid post-game. The question is whether or not his moves will translate to this level before he gains more muscle. Henderson, a Texas implant, is yet another 3-point threat at Enfield’s disposal. He will be an option to stretch the floor if Boatwright has to play limited minutes due to injuries or fouls.
This USC team is built to fly, and it just might. It has a precarious balance between youth and upperclassmen, raw athleticism and tailored craft, speed and size, but it has outstanding leadership in McLaughlin, Enfield and his staff.
“Jordan is one of the best leaders I’ve been around in my life,” Mathews said. “He doesn’t get mad at us freshmen because he’s been there through the whole process. Now that it’s about to be game time, the freshman are acclimated, and we know what to do.” 
Despite the youth, Enfield does not underestimate the maturity and teamsmanship of this squad.
“They understand the importance of every game,” he said after the team’s penultimate preseason practice. “We have a young, exciting team, and my message is to enjoy the moment, because this is what you work for your entire life and especially in the offseason.” 
When the season begins on Friday, nervous butterflies will flutter around the program as fans wait to see whether or not last year was a fluke or the harbinger of the Enfield era everyone wants to see: The one where “Slam City” becomes a household name, and the Trojans string together Pac-12 Championships and deep NCAA Tournament runs.

The women’s volleyball team has two big games against Stanford and Cal on Thursday and Saturday, respectively. The team has had a somewhat bumpy season, with losses to inferior opponents, but winning enough to sport a 16-9 overall record and an 8-6 mark in conference play.
This will be the Trojans’ second time seeing both Cal and Stanford, as they played the two teams at home a litle under three weeks ago. USC beat Cal 3-0, but then lost to Stanford that same weekend at home. While it may seem more difficult to be successful on foreign courts, so far this season, the Trojans have played very well on the road, going 6-1 in away games.
This season, senior libero Taylor Whittingham has proved to be an indestructible force for the Women of Troy. Even through a knee injury, she has been breaking barriers as a libero that would be difficult even if she were completely healthy. This past week, Whittingham was named Senior CLASS Award Finalist, showing her dedication both on and off the court. She also received the Pac-12 Defensive Player of the week and is sixth in USC’s all-time career record book in digs. 
Other members that will look to contribute on the court this weekend include freshman outside hitter Khalia Lanier and senior setter Alice Pizzasegola. Pizzasegola was named to the CoSIDA Academic All-District team this past week for excelling considerably in the classroom and on the court. Lanier continues to have an impressive freshman season — this past weekend she recorded 12.5 points along with 3 blocks and 10 digs to complete her 12th double-double. 
Head coach Mick Haley said he believes there will be successful outcomes this weekend at Stanford and Cal. The Trojans fell to Stanford 3-0 in October, which he attributed to fear of their size. The Cardinal have a few players that tower at 6-foot-8 and 6-foot-6, heights that the team had not faced before. Stanford is also currently tied for first in the Pac-12. 
“I think we have a chance to win,” Haley said. “We play well at Stanford, so we’ll see what happens.” 
Playing at Cal can prove difficult because of the crowd. The Bears have a large arena in Haas Pavilion and typically have a large turnout for games. However, the last time USC faced Cal, they handedly beat them 3-0. 
“We just prepare for going in there and having [Haas Pavilion] echo,” Haley said. “If they’re bringing in the band, it will be rowdy, but we just have to play well.” 
Overall, Haley said the Trojans have been steadily getting better — improving in aspects of their game such serving, passing and hitting. Most importantly, their communication has improved, which is essential to being successful in volleyball. Now that it is November, it is important that the team fix everything they can to do well in post-season.
Haley believes the Trojans’ road success has to do with the togetherness of traveling. They have little distractions and are able to focus more on the games at hand. Hostile crowds may exist, but the Women of Troy have managed to overcome that and play their best. 
“Where we are with our team, we are getting better, and that’s what I ask for in November,” Haley said.
The Women of Troy will face Stanford today at 7:30 p.m. and Cal on Saturday at 3:00 p.m.

For a few sweet weeks, football and basketball season will overlap. Starting on Friday, the men’s basketball team starts their next March Madness campaign. This Saturday, the football team has the chance to pull off one of the greatest upsets of this season when they face the potentially playoff-bound No. 4 Washington Huskies. 
As these programs continue to attempt to break into the stratosphere of the elite teams, they are bolstered by the success and popularity of their NBA and NFL counterparts. Sure, USC has a long-standing tradition of great NFL players — and that’s probably an understatement — but the reason that USC is a storied program is partly due to what happens to Trojans after they graduate.
The basketball team is now entering that critical phase. On the cusp of becoming a conference-leading team, the Trojans have some doubts entering this year since they lost so many players, two to the NBA draft and several others as transfers.
Julian Jacobs and Nikola Jovanovic, the two players USC lost to the NBA last year, are D-League players. However, there is hope for the glory of USC basketball players to live on, primarily through Toronto Raptors guard DeMar DeRozan. He is already averaging 33.7 points this season and is a popular player following a gold medal performance with Team USA in Rio this summer.
The other most well-known player in the NBA is unfortunately a grown man who calls himself Swaggy — Lakers guard Nick “Swaggy P” Young. Young is averaging 14.5 points through eight games this season.
Of course, how successful USC’s season is has nothing to do with the performance of these two guards, but the future of the program does have something to do with them. Just as the prestige of our football team has, in part, grown over a long time through NFL successes, the basketball program will gain more national recognition if it consistently churns out top prospects and players who make an impact on their NBA teams.
It’s too early to say whether Jacobs,Jovanovic or both will have impactful NBA careers, but unlike the NFL, which doesn’t have a developmental league, it can be difficult for players to break through with their teams constantly drafting newer, younger, better talent each June.
Despite the underwhelming amount of USC alumni in the NBA — there are five including DeRozan and Young — the recruiting hasn’t been strong enough to help or weak enough to hurt the Trojans. With just one recruit in the ESPN 100 from last year, the Trojans will have a hard time competing with Pac-12 powers Arizona, Arizona State and UCLA who brought in two, three and three players in the top 100 respectively.
While a dearth of recruits may not negatively impact the team this year — USC returns four major contributors — it is imperative to continue a winning tradition. A strength for Enfield has been bringing in transfers, such as redshirt sophomore forward and Louisville transfer Shaqquan Aaron who should have an immediate impact on the team. Redshirt senior forward Charles Buggs is eligible this year after transferring from Minnesota  during the offseason, and the Trojans recently signed a Duke transfer, Derryck Thornton, who, will have three seasons of eligibility remaining after sitting out this year.
Enfield has begun building a solid foundation for the future, which of course can only be bolstered by success on the court — both at the Galen Center and in the NBA. This is the Trojans’ year to take the next step and compete once again for a conference championship. Eyes will be on USC to improve upon last year after being knocked out of the NCAA tournament in the first round, but they have the infrastructure in place with their main contributors to be able to make that leap.
On the flip side, with only four returners who regularly see the floor, there will be a lot of pressure on newcomers to make an impact. This is the year to do it though. The newest Trojans have the biggest opportunity in front of them, but of course basketball is a team sport and as their motto says, “It takes a team.”

USC football continued preparations at Howard Jones Field on Wednesday, as the Trojans travel to Seattle to face the undefeated Huskies on Saturday, still with an outside chance at topping the Pac-12 South if they manage to pull off the upset.
And the Trojans’ determination to do so was evident throughout practice this week. Recordings of barking dogs, screaming crowds and the Washington marching band provided the best imitation of Husky Stadium. USC has pulled out all the stops in an effort to gain an edge against Washington, but players credited a daily routine as the one that has helped the team progress throughout the season.
“Iron Sharpens Iron”
Every practice, the first-team offense and defense go head-to-head, and those in attendance get a chance to see matchups such as junior wideout JuJu Smith-Schuster taking on junior cornerback Adoree’ Jackson. The team calls it “iron sharpens iron.”
“You get a real look at real starters in the Pac-12 — nothing can substitute for that,” junior safety Chris Hawkins said. “Going against [redshirt freshman quarterback] Sam [Darnold] and JuJu really helps us.”
As a team that believes in its own talent, the Trojans think no one will push them harder than their teammates.
“We’re always challenging each other in practice,” senior linebacker Michael Hutchings said. “And it’s paying off.”
Housebreaking the Huskies
Wednesday’s practice also focused on an efficient, pro-style Washington offense that has averaged 48.3 points per game: second best in the FBS. Head coach Clay Helton called the Huskies “the most balanced team we’ve played.”
“They just line up and play good, sound football,” he said. “That’s the mark of a Chris Petersen team.”
Indeed, Washington has threats scattered all over the field, from running back Myles Gaskin to the big-play receiving threats of John Ross and Dante Pettis. But most eyes will likely be focused on the Huskies’ quarterback: Heisman candidate John Browning.
“He’s really a general for their offense. He gets everybody going,” Hawkins said. “He doesn’t really make mistakes … and he gets the ball to his receivers.”
Facing a tough task this weekend, Hawkins called for the squad to rally around Helton.
“I will say this. This is his biggest game,” Hawkins said of his coach. “We’ve got to go play for him and for ourselves. We want to bring USC back to where it used to be, and this is a big step in that way.”
“We can’t worry about anyone else,” Hawkins summed up. “The season is on the line every week.”
Injury Update
Helton also provided updates on injured Trojans. Defensive tackle Stevie Tu’ikolovatu made progress coming off a platelet rich plasma injection in his knee, and Helton said he “wouldn’t be surprised” if the redshirt senior played on Saturday.

The women’s basketball head coach Cynthia Cooper-Dykes announced that the Trojans had two top-20 ranked guards sign letters of intent for the 2017 season. Both Shalexxus Aaron and Destiny Littleton hail from California and are ready to join USC in order to create legacies of their own. 
“We paved a way,” Cooper-Dyke said. “Now it’s time for them to put their own bricks down that path.”
Shalexxus Aaron, ranked as the 16th best guard in the nation according to ESPN, is a 6-foot-1 guard from Martin Luther King High School in Riverside. Aaron has been proving herself on the court as the league MVP her freshman year. 
“Shalexxus is an athletic perimeter prospect with length, wingspan and a versatile skill set,” Cooper-Dyke said. “She is a great fit for our style of play and adds to our size and length on the perimeter. Shalexxus can deliver in transition, finish at the rim, has 3-point range and is active on the glass.” 
Along with Aaron, Littleton will also be joining the team in 2017 as a 5-foot-9 guard from The Bishop’s School in La Jolla. On top of winning CIF awards for Freshmen, Sophomore and Junior of the Year, she is currently 905 points shy of passing the California state scoring record, with her senior season  still to go.
“Destiny is a strong, crafty combo guard who really can score the ball,” Cooper-Dyke said. “She is physical, delivers off the bounce, has a quick release on her jumper, and can handle and pass in a fast game.”
Both of these guards are key additions to the Women of Troy, especially since senior guard Jordan Adams graduates in the spring. These players are examples of the constant growth that the women’s basketball team is striving for in order to be a top program in the Pac-12 and the NCAA.

On the night of the election, the Canadian immigration website continually crashed. Google Trends shows a spike in searches for “Canadian immigration” starting at 11 p.m. According to The Telegraph, American internet searches for “emigrate” steadily increased throughout election night as well. Of course, moving to Canada memes and tweets weren’t invented Tuesday night. In 2012, the internet had plenty of fun ridiculing people tweeting that they were moving to Canada after the Supreme Court upheld the Affordable Care Act. The Canadian website crashing, presumably due to increased traffic, is different. This was the result of people actually panicking over the potential of a Trump presidency and attempting to see how they could leave the country. 
I am writing this the morning after the election and know for certain now that Donald Trump will be the 45th President of the United States. 
Part of me also wants to move to Canada. However, if the Trump upset Tuesday night proves anything, it’s that this country has its work cut out.
On the one hand, the election Tuesday night was not a surprise. A country founded on and still steeped in white supremacist values voted for the candidate endorsed by the KKK. But on the other hand, I was surprised. I woke up Tuesday morning anxious. But I was anxious about my essays, readings and laundry piling up. I actually felt rather confident about a Clinton win. So, when Trump won Florida, North Carolina and Pennsylvania, I was shocked. And looking at the exit polls, I am even more shocked. CNN exit polls show that white people 18-29 voted in larger numbers for Trump. In fact, when looking at both age and race, as well as gender and race, Trump won every white demographic. Yes, that includes white women. 
Less than a month ago, after the Trump tapes and accusations of sexual assault, FiveThirtyEight released a graphic of what the electoral college would look like if only women were to vote. The country looked overwhelmingly blue. But after these election results, it seems clear that it was not gender that decided the election — though Hillary Clinton was undoubtedly hindered by her gender — it was race. White people, both men and women, elected Donald Trump president. And that’s why moving to Canada is simply out of the question. 
The results of this election were the culmination of resentment — some justified and some not. The grievances of working class Americans cannot be ignored, but the target of this anger must never be marginalized communities. Disillusionment with government has been misdirected at Muslims, immigrants and the LGBT community. 
Trump capitalized on these real frustrations, using them to fuel xenophobia, transphobia, Islamophobia, ableism and more. 
Ignoring the causes of Trump’s success, whether by moving to Canada or becoming apathetic about the political process in general, does nothing to protect these communities that have been so negatively impacted by the toxic rhetoric of the 2016 campaign. 
It is time for white people, myself included, to do some real soul searching. Don’t give your homophobic uncle a pass at Thanksgiving dinner. Don’t laugh when your friend makes a racist joke. The bigotry that Trump brought to light was already a danger to marginalized communities long before the election. But now that he has rendered it more visible for those of us who had the privilege to ignore it before, it is our responsibility to make sure we are working to positively change our culture. A Republican-controlled Senate, House and executive branch is frightening for women, people of color, queer people and undocumented immigrants. And while it may seem like there is little we can do now, it is vitally important that we reach out to those most likely to be impacted, offer our support and work to heal as a country.

So much to say in breaking down this article…. But let’s start with this:  Anyone else find it ironic that Democrats upset with our election results are researching Canada’s immigration laws in anticipation of a move, given that they don’t seem to believe immigration laws matter in the first place?  I get the distinct impression they don’t believe in following immigration laws.
The writer expresses her latent racism — “Part of me also wants to move to Canada” — by completely dismissing our neighbors to the south.  Why, when NIMBY white liberals protest Trump, do they promise to flee only to Canada?  What’s wrong with Mexico, the country most liberals so vociferously defended against Trump’s claims about Mexican illegal aliens?  Her offensive comments triggered me, I’m afraid of microaggressions, and demand my safe space!
Here’s the deal – for all the empty promises of celebrities fleeing to Canada or elsewhere is Trump got elected – all those liberal hypocrites would rather live in the US with a Trump prez than anywhere else in the world. That is a fact. That is how awesome and badass the US is. We should take more pride in being Americans and not let “patriotism” be a liberal punchline synonym for “racist”. The fact these threats meant we can finally get rid of sanctimonious Lena Dunham and Chelsea Handler, among others makes me very happy. Although I know they will never follow through on their threats because although they expect all politicians to mean what they say – these vacuous celebrities never do. I also strongly disagree every one of the 60 million people who voted for Trump did so because all 60 million of them are racist. You do realize many of those whites that voted for Trump also voted for Obama both times? Perhaps more people despised lying crooked Hillary and wanted to send her a proverbial finger at the polls? Only the most liberal, insular person would feel all white people need to take a good long hard look in the mirror and confront what they have done. This is ridiculous. And this myopic thinking i also why you all were blindsided in this election – keep it up.
Funny, and so shortsighted and agenda driven are you, that Trump’s repudiation of the KKK doesn’t matter.  It goes to show you that women can be bullies, too.  Your micro-agressions are too numerous to count and the safe-room is locked!  There comes a time when people like you who renounce the cornerstone of democracy – elections – have to leave.  Just leave and stop disrupting the truly productive folk.  Grow the hell up. The push back is on, baby!
Here we go. Another article has the same liberal view as always. Keep saying ‘Love Trumps hate’ and yet did exactly what they said Trump supporter would do after they lost – bullying, violence and totally against the first amendment when other people disagree with them.
You keep saying ‘do not judge’ yet now blaming everything and tagging all Trump supporters with xenophobia, transphobia, Islamophobia, ableism without even listen to their voice. Now, you want to force other people with different opinions to be silent, which would cost you another republic presidency four years later for sure.
I assume you already checked out the exit poll result from CNN/NYT. Now, the fact is, for the people with college degree, Hillary has only 4% thin lead. What makes you think your are the central of universe? You are not even get enough support from college degree voter to call yourself ‘majority’ statistically. Even in California, Trump gets 33%. But have you ever found anyone around you saying they support him? Nope! Because we are undercover. We know what would your liberal would do if you know we support him. We will get ignored, bullied or maybe fired. Trying to silence the people with different opinions, that’s not Democracy. That’s actually called Fascism. You can do this to us, then one day someone else would do the same thing to you. When you are mocking ‘low educated, poor red neck Trump supporter’ , we slap your face by voting our president.
Wake up and communicate with the other side. World is not just black and white, blue and red. Keep denying won’t help you understanding the rest of the world.
The polls conducted did not factor in the Tom Bradley effect.  A small fraction of the voters lied to the pollsters that they would vote for Clinton when they were really intending to vote for Trump.  In the case of the Californian gubernatorial race between Tom Bradley and Robert Deukmejian in 1982, the polls over-inflated Bradley’s potential y 14 percentage points; and it was a close election with the latter scraping through by an absolutely  paper-thin majority.   My estimate of the Bradley effect was about 7 percentage points for the Clinton-Trump election, and that was clearly reflected in the battle-ground states.  Since Clinton was a white candidate who supported non-white minorities, I estimated half of the the Bradley effect in this case.

What was once a proud nation with an innovative past and a consistently bright future has turned into a cheap roadside attraction filled with enough Elvis impersonators, Walmarts and Big Macs to fulfill the declining standards of Americans far and wide. As a country we have come to accept mediocrity, whether it be in the arts, the sciences or even our once-proud free market tradition. We were once sending citizens to the moon and boasted some of the greatest scientific advancements known to civilization. Now times of objectivist thought and human advancement have given way to social justice warriors and postmodern inference. Our standards are low. As we fail to take ourselves seriously, others will be quick to discount our actions.
Perhaps the greatest victim to our low standards is the American presidency. What was once a serious decision in the lives of Americans has transformed into a lifestyle statement. Our founding fathers fought the Revolutionary War to break ties with a repressive government, Susan B. Anthony campaigne for women’s right to vote and countless members of the civil rights movement fought for the equal representation of minority groups. However, when we reach the ballot box we tend to forget our proud history and take a sacred decision as seriously as a Starbucks order.
Not even the presidency is off-limits to America’s domesticated culture anymore. Donald Trump, as most are aware, was a well-known television personality, which by twisted fate has become synonymous with the modern presidency. American politics has come to a place where reality TV stars are elected for their popularity over their merit. Yes, one could attempt to argue that Trump was a “fine businessman.” However, in reality, it was his persona and personal brand and not his tact or skill that managed to keep his real estate empire afloat. As Americans, we have come to value veneer as opposed to substance. The structures that support our dreams and aspirations are unfortunately no longer valued. So long as our pursuits appear to trend toward results which may, but probably won’t, happen, we are completely satisfied — most notably in our recent pick for president.
We were once told to ask not what our country could do for us, but what we could do for our country. Instead we voted a demagogue into the highest office in the once-free world. So in a few weeks’ time as we dine this Thanksgiving, with the tawdry American tradition of football blaring in the background, remember that America was once a proud country which held itself to high standards and understood real values. If we play our cards right, even in these challenging times, America can once again value its future just as much as its past.
YOUNG AMERICANS PLEASE READ THIS MESSAGE
THIS IS A MUST READ FOR ANYONE WHO ISTHINKING ABOUT WHAT JUST HAPPENED IN THE ELECTION. PLEASE CIRCULATE THIS MESSAGE ON CAMPUS!
It is hard me to believe that so many young Americans and Democrats are fearful of President Elect Donald Trump and The New Republican Party. Today’s Republican Party is the party protecting Americans rights and future. READ THIS ARTICLE.
These young people are protesting for a candidate whose message and history was that of corruption. The families Clinton Foundation is the center of the corruption. TAKE THE TIME TO READ ALL THE CLINTON FOUNDATION HISTORY OF CORRUPTION. THE OLDER GENRATION LIVED THROUGH IT THAT IS WHY THEY VOTED FOR REAL HOPE AND CHANGE.
Facts the Protesters do not know but need to hear.
AFRICAN AMERICAN CHILDREN ARE SUFFERING IN POVERTY IN THE US. THESE ARE FACTS. DO YOUR RESEARCH. PRESEDENT ELECT DONALD TRUMP LET AMERICA KNOW, 4 out of every 10 African Americans children under the age of 6 live in poverty. Think about these statistics. By the Democratic Party keeping this culture down it will create many more Americans with potential that will end up becoming in one way or another dependent on American Government. President Elect Trump offers a strong contrast to the historical norm. Let’s educate minorities, build minority infrastructure hubs and create jobs and opportunities for the minority cultures. THE MESSAGE AND PLAN IS REAL
97 MILLION AMERICANS are out of the work force. The US has about 350 Million people. The current administration was not reporting the actual facts.
The media is controlled by organizations looking to create a nationalized government. The reporters feel they are doing right because the information they are being feed by manipulated groups. Here is an Example and a dose of Truth.
 For starters, The Clinton’s used her Foundation as a way for people to gain access to Hillary’s State Department. Of the 154 people who had an audience with Secretary Clinton, 85 of them donated to her Foundation in some manner.
It is important to note that these weren’t small donors either. The 85 people gave a combined donation of $156 million to Clinton’s charity.
The Clinton Foundation has also received a number of donations which were from abusive and anti-American nations. This alone undercuts Hillary’s claim that she wanted to be a champion for minorities and women. These nations included Saudi Arabia, which has a notable ban on women operating a vehicle and is against gay rights. How many Americans are aware of this fact? The bigger question is why people especially young people would blindly follow a party and individual that was bought and paid for by special interests.
Bernie Sanders and the election process were manipulated so he did not win by the DNC. You do not hear the media talking or reporting about it. The past two DNC heads which we know about manipulated the selection process of the democratic selected candidate.
The reason Americans elected Donald Trump is because he is a true businessman and has the instinct and intelligence to lead our nation. He called out all the problems.
He is not represented properly by the media. It is propaganda. He was an amazing businessman and also in the T& A Industry. He was amazingly successful in both industries. Think about it, when a comedian develops an act, is that truly who the comedian is as a person. NO
Donald J. Trump is a true American hero. People who never stopped to research him or just blindly believed the media are being fooled. The 60 Million, Yes 60 Million American who voted for President Elect Trump, took the time to understand his true message.
Even if you doubt him, give him a chance. You will eventually look at him as an American Hero.
In history we had another President who used the same ideas to change and make America great. His name was Ronald Regan. He was a movie actor who starred in Bedtime for Bonzo. He became one of the great American Presidents in our history and helped all American People. Give President Trump a chance. Learn the real facts, Study WikiLeaks. God Bless America.
This is an opinion article for Americans to really consider.

The hesitation is first shown in “Race Car.” The poem discusses how things were moving quickly and I didn’t want it all to end. I have to continue to fuel the relationship to keep it going, and the second I hesitate to fuel it, the car will stop. However, I don’t want it to stop, and I know that for something this precious, I can’t let the fuel run out.

In “This is real,” I wrote about how I realized that the relationship is real and it isn’t something I should fear. Despite how much I hesitated, I always remember why I shouldn’t.
Steven Vargas | Daily Trojan
“Mindless” is an experimental poem I did that follows the same topic. It is about how I got so familiar with the relationship that I couldn’t imagine my life without it; I didn’t want it to crash.

One reason why I worry about maintaining relationships — both platonic and romantic relationships — is because of time and conflicting schedules. We all have our own lives, and I do not like to have a relationship interfere with them. In “Everyday” I wrote about this feeling. There are times when I want time to freeze so that I can keep these relationships, but we all have our own responsibilities that do not wait.
Steven Vargas | Daily Trojan
The last poem, “People,” is about how we understand other people. We can try and write about them in books, but sometimes words aren’t enough to describe people or how we feel about them. We are too abstract to be put into words.

Trevor Sochocki | Daily Trojan Stronger together · Dozens of students came together in an impromptu gathering Tuesday night after election results handed Donald Trump the victory. Speakers expressed fear for minority groups, including undocumented immigrants and people of color, and urged young people to make a change by voting in local elections.
Hahahahahahahahahahahahahaha, this is freakin hilarious. Buried deep in the US Constitution, next to the stuff about fraternities being placed on double secret probation, you will find an article detailing how student rallies can be used to overturn the results of a fair and legal election.  
What would the day be without college snowflakes gathering to show the rest of us how morally superior they are to the rest of us.
Snow Flakes got butt hurt!
Hey College kids, if you rally hard enough it will overturn the election result.

Students, faculty and staff gathered to watch the election results and listen to insights from experts and special guests at Wallis Annenberg Hall on Tuesday evening prior to the election.
Jenny Chung | Daily TrojanThe final countdown · Dan Schnur, director of the Jesse M. Unruh Institute of Politics, moderated a discussion on what to expect on election night Tuesday afternoon in the Wallis Annenberg Hall lobby.
The hour-long panels weighed in on the role of media in the election as well as expectations the analysts had on the night’s results.
Geoffrey Cowan, a professor and the former dean of Annenberg, facilitated the first panel, entitled, “Behind the Scenes on Election Night: Journalists, Campaigns and the Special Role of the Associated Press.”
The panelists discussed the behind-the-scenes of major networks and the candidates themselves.
Susan Estrich, a Robert Kingsley professor of law and political science at the USC Gould School of Law, ran Democratic presidential candidate Michael Dukakis’ presidential campaign in 1988. Through the lens of her experience, she recounted the candidates’ possible feelings during election day.
“All of a sudden, there’s nothing to do but wait,” she said. “He’s or she’s, hopefully, trying to look calm and relaxed,” Estrich said. “When the cameras leave, will the candidate be calm and relaxed? No. They’re sitting there, looking at six screens, making telephone calls and saying, ‘what do you hear?’”
Major news outlets send reporters all over the country to make observations and combine them with the poll results, according to Sue Cross, executive director and CEO of the Institute for Nonprofit News and former senior vice president of the Associated Press.
“Voting and counting the votes is a very grassroots thing,” she said. “There’s no federal system; it’s a vast network. The way you’re getting those numbers is from over 4,000 people trained in advance.”
Roger Smith, editor for the USC Center for Health Reporting and former national editor of the Los Angeles Times, provided the perspective from a print angle. Smith believes this election cycle focused on coverage of the people.
“There’s been a big change in the way news organizations are approaching [elections],” he said. “You have to publish constantly, all the time. And that’s what’s going on today.”
Between the two panels, students, faculty and staff gathered together to watch CNN announce the first live results.
Dan Schnur, the director of the Jesse M. Unruh Institute of Politics, facilitated the second panel, titled “What to Expect Tonight.”
The panelists discussed significant states and figures the audience should look for during election night, as well as the importance of various Senate races.
Justin Wallin, chief operating officer and chief marketing officer of Probolsky Research, looked to Florida and Virginia as keys for winning the White House.
“We’re really looking for Florida,” he said. “Both of [the candidates] really have to win that.”
Trump ended up winning Florida by a narrow margin, while Clinton took Virginia.
Third-year law student Chase Bakaly agreed with the importance of Florida, but also looked to his home state of Virginia for a tight race.
“The northern part of the state [has] changed immensely the past couple of years,” he said. “It’ll be interesting to see how Sen. Kaine influences that vote.”
According to Wallin, the Trump campaign will get the initial lead in Virginia, but he should feel more comfortable with the lead once poll results from Northern Virginia are reported.
“Certainly Virginia,” Wallin said. Virginia’s kind of funny. We’re expecting to see some earlier terms favoring Trump. It will be very close.”
Robert Shrum, Carmen H. and Louis Warschaw Chair in Practical Politics and political science professor, emphasized that Clinton will win through Florida.
“If she wins Florida, there’s almost no plan for Trump,” he said. “If she carries Ohio, she carries Michigan, you could be on the edge of an electoral college landslide.”
Clinton would go on to lose both Florida and Ohio, with Michigan still too close to call at press time.
Lily Vaughan, vice president of the USC College Democrats and editorial director of the Daily Trojan, said she was interested in voter turnout and margins of victory.
“In this election, I’m interested in the overall results of each state,” she said. “But, more specifically, how red the red states turn out and how blue the blue states turn out.”
The panel also discussed the importance of Senate control.
According to Bakaly, the executive and legislative branches will also have to choose at least one new Supreme Court Justice.
“The implications go far beyond tonight,” Bakaly said.
City Controller Ron Galperin also came as a special guest to speak about the importance of the election night.
“Many years from now, you are going to remember this night, and the history that is being made,” he said.

Though the presidential race may have garnered the most attention last night, several important California elections, including statewide and local initiatives and the senate race, were also decided.
Some of the most widely anticipated ballot propositions covered gun ammunition registration and background checks and marijuana legalization, both of which passed. The senate race between Kamala Harris and Loretta Sanchez, which Harris won, also attracted significant interest.
With the ballots counted, students and faculty weighed in on the potential consequences of these propositions and elections and how they may affect California in the years to come.
Proposition 63 drew out very different responses from students.
“I voted yes [on Prop. 63 regarding ammunition background checks],” said Lena Tavitian, a sophomore majoring in economics and business administration. “For gun control, you need to increase regulation. Hopefully it will make it harder for people to get ammo.”
Diego Hernandez, a sophomore majoring in physics, thought Prop. 63 may infringe on Californians’ second amendment rights.
“I’m pro guns… and I disagree with any type of gun control on any ballot,” Hernandez said. “This is just another example of democrats trying to take away our second amendment rights. It bodes poorly for California, because we already have some of the strictest regulations.”
Hernandez also commented on Proposition 64 regarding marijuana legalization, saying that increasing access to drugs may prove to be a mistake.
“The law is misleading in a way because, although it legalizes marijuana, it also heavily regulates it, which may create another problem,” Hernandez said. “I don’t believe marijuana should be made legal because it’s a gateway drug.”
Jordan Tolentino, an undeclared sophomore, offered a different perspective, saying that legalization will reduce enforcement expenses.
“We waste a lot of time, money and resources, especially on law enforcement, for people who are smoking and in possession of marijuana,” Jordan said. “I feel that if we legalize marijuana, we will help destroy the black market in California for marijuana. We can allocate our resources for law enforcement much more wisely if we legalize marijuana.”
According to Christian Grose, an associate professor of public policy, California Attorney General Kamala Harris prevailed in her senatorial race largely because of her persona and presence, not her policies.
“California had its first major statewide race under the new top-two primary system where the two general election candidates were both candidates. Because the voters chose between two Democrats, other factors beyond partisanship were at play,” Grose said. “Because both Sanchez and Harris were Democrats, more voters likely evaluated which of the two was perceived as better on non-policy dimensions. Harris won as she appeared more polished and better prepared to many of the states’ voters.”
Dan Schnur, director of the Unruh Institute of Politics, commented on the role millennial voters played in passing many of these referenda.
“I think what’s most interesting about the outcomes of these initiatives is how young voters in California seem to have weighed in in a much more progressive fashion on most, if not all, of them, than their parents or grandparents,” Schnur said. “While California in general is a deep blue state and leans decidedly leftward, the youngest California voters are the most aggressively progressive on these issues and almost certainly fuel the outcomes.”
Schnur also noted that, in spite of the attention paid to national races, local and statewide election results may actually have more of an impact on voters’ daily lives.
“National elections get all the attention,” Schnur said. “There’s more glamour attached to them, and they attract the attention of the entire country. But ultimately, a voter can make a much greater difference in a campaign for a local or statewide office, or a local or statewide ballot initiative. Even though these elections tend to get less attention, in the long run they can be just as, if not more, impactful.”

Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump won the 2016 election on Tuesday night, beating out Democrat Hillary Clinton in a narrow and largely unexpected victory.
Of the 11 battleground states — Colorado, Florida, Iowa, Michigan, Nevada, New Hampshire, North Carolina, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Virginia and Wisconsin — nine went to Trump.
There was a tense flip-flop between Trump and Clinton up until the last electoral votes came in. Bob Shrum, a political science professor at the USC Dornsife College of Letters, Arts and Sciences and longtime political consultant, explained his concerns when Donald Trump gripped 244 electoral votes.
“At the beginning of the day, they said it would take a miracle for Donald Trump to win,” Shrum said. “At this point it would take a miracle for Hillary Clinton to win. She is losing states Democrats almost always carry.”
It was a miracle that never came.
Near 11:30 p.m. PST, Trump was able to win the state of Wisconsin and garner 276 total electoral votes, six votes more than the necessary number to be president. Shortly afterward, Clinton called Trump to concede the election.
The results garnered mixed feelings in students watching the votes come in.
Doctoral student Erica Silva met the results with uneasiness, especially in contrast to the optimism expressed in the 2008 and 2012 elections.
“My freshman year, we watched Obama win the election, and the mood on campus was one of joy and hope,” Silva said. “Right now I think that the mood here is one of despair, one of shock, one of disbelief. We’re not really sure what’s going on.”
Conservative voices were also present. Diego Hernandez, a sophomore majoring in physics, said that he was overjoyed and relieved by the prospect of a Trump presidency.
“I think it [is] a very trying time for Americans, so in a sense I’m a relieved that Hillary didn’t win, mainly because of Supreme Court nominations,” Hernandez said. “We need to keep a conservative majority on the court. I’m hoping [Trump] will be able to get the recipe of success right, but I think no matter what he does he will always be a step above Clinton.”
Over the past several weeks, most major polls had predicted a Clinton victory. As of Tuesday morning, The New York Times gave Clinton an 84 percent chance of winning, though the Dornsife/Los Angeles Times Daybreak Poll stood out for its prediction of a Trump win.
Students largely reflected this divide between the polling predictions and the actual results, expressing surprise and shock.
“I did not expect this at all. I thought it would be a very easy win for Hillary,” said Thomas Demoner, a junior majoring in business administration with a concentration in cinematic arts. “I never really took Trump seriously. I’m a little embarrassed, [because] he’s definitely going to decay the country’s image.”
Sophie Greensite, a junior majoring in economics, mirrored Demoner’s statements, especially in regard to the numerous swing states that Trump won.
“I’m worried for our country,” Greensite said. “Trump just instills such a divisive rhetoric in people, and I don’t stand for anything that he says. I think that he’s only going to serve to further separate our nation.”
Ted Steinberg, a junior majoring in policy, planning and development, said that he accepts the results of the election despite being taken aback by them.
“I am shocked but also somewhat ashamed that I’m shocked,” Steinberg said. “We always hear that the polls aren’t 100 percent, and here we are trusting the polls a little too much, in part out of a cautious optimism that I guess came around and bit us.”
Senate results were announced on Tuesday night as well, with Republicans winning 51 seats and Democrats winning 47, leaving a Republican majority. The House of Representatives also maintained its Republican majority, with 235 seats announced to the Democrats’ 185.
Nitika Johri, a senior majoring in cognitive science, said that the advent of a Republican president coupled with a Republican majority in Congress was extremely concerning.
“I’m feeling pretty disheartened and a little bit scared,” Johri said. “A Trump presidency is scary enough, but what’s scary to me is also having Republicans hold the House and the Senate and what is going to happen with the Supreme Court justices. I feel scared not only for myself as a colored female, but I feel scared for a lot of the people who have expressed interest in being Democrats or being progressive.”
A newspaper should never describe an event as a “surprise.” Surprise to whom? I, an ordinary person, was not at all surprised. I don’t know anyone who expressed support for Hillary Clinton, and she was a terrible candidate, on the issues and stylistically.
Mr. Trump better understand his mandate; people want a robust economy and jobs, jobs, jobs.  With a Republican Congress to support this mandate, there are no more excuses.  Let’s unite and get to work.
Just know that 7 out of 10 Americans voted for Donald Trump.  I was the largest landslide victory since Ronald Reagan.  The “hope and change” mantra of Obama has been a failure and now it is time to take back America from the progressive Left and get back on track.  Even Hillary Clinton says that the best days of America is about to come.  And that will be under the guidance and leadership of President-elect Trump and the cooperative spirit that he will bring to Congress to get things done.  God help us all.
1) Sure not a landslide in the popular vote which is the truer reflection of our country!
2) “7 out of 10 Americans” is a bold-faced lie. 26.4% of eligible voters in the US voted for Trump. 26.5% voted for Clinton. 44.4% didn’t vote at all — and I wonder how many of them couldn’t because of voter suppression laws made by Republicans. “Sad!”
You are correct with the popular vote  number.  But what voter suppression laws are you referring to and why do you think Republicans are behind them?

Our worst fears came true last night.
Donald Trump —  the arrogant, alt-right, bombastic candidate of hate — will be the 45th President of the United States.
Donald Trump — a man who built his campaign on the rotten foundations of misogyny, bigotry and fear-mongering — will be the next leader of the free world.
We stand solemn today. We stand in both shock and shame as we’ve watched this man grow from a sideshow display of political mockery to our newly elected head of state.
Like countless college students across the nation, we foolishly enclosed ourselves in liberal echo chambers while hundreds of miles away in gaping pockets across America, the voices of mostly white, working-class males, screamed out “Trump, Trump, Trump!”
In our attempt to celebrate progress, promote diversity and encapsulate the shifting demographics of America, we neglected to acknowledge a sect of the American electorate that felt both disenfranchised by these very trends and excluded by the institutions that promote them.
This election made one thing frightfully clear: There exists two Americas, and only one of them was getting our attention.
We ignored the demographic that whole-heartedly believed in a country that was broken, that needed barriers to be fortified, that needed to turn away diversity to achieve stability. That is the population of people that bought into Trump’s disgusting rhetoric.
They were invisible from the media, invisible from the polls, and in their eyes, invisible to the institutions in Washington.Trump gave them a voice, a scapegoat and most importantly, visibility.
Ironically, these legions of Trump supporters saw themselves disintegrating from the cloth of modern America; but perhaps, it is now the progressive, diverse body of America that has little place.
As a member of the press corps, we cannot help but feel we are partially to blame. We were complicit in the rose-colored lenses of “unity” and “togetherness” that the Clinton campaign projected and the idea that Trump’s America did not and would not ever exist.
Countless veritable publications covered Trump, the bombastic celebrity, for his widely publicized gaffes and his petulant social media tirades. They argued that his ideology attacked marginalized people — women, people of color, religious groups, immigrants, the LGBT community — and if elected, the America we know from history books would crumble. And this, though true, failed to fully address the people on the other side. In their vision for America’s prosperity, the white, working-class man — the poster child of the Trump voting bloc — does not prioritize the interests of traditionally marginalized people. Legions of silent Trump supporters whom he represented were left uncovered in the media’s narrative.
We at the Daily Trojan are as guilty as any media outlet of just this. We ran countless opinion pieces, labeling Trump as “unqualified,” a “racist,” a “sexist,” a “xenophobe” and even “orange,” but never did we treat him as a viable voice for an American populace that felt betrayed by our government. Of course, our dismissals of Trump did not deter these voters from voting for Trump, because they themselves felt dismissed by us.
The America we saw was one paved with the promise of a brighter, more equal future for all. A major political party had just nominated its first female candidate for president following the election of the first black president, and to us, America was making strides to form a more perfect union. This, however, was not the America they saw. The America they saw was leaving them behind, and they felt unheard and discouraged by the American political system.
With the election of Donald Trump, our viewpoints have shifted. While we, on liberal college campuses across the country, lamented a step backward for the country we want to live in, they see a brighter future, with a candidate that will not cast them aside as yesterday’s polling numbers.
But this comes with dangerous consequences.
We cannot downplay the historic significance of this outcome, even beyond the loss of our first real chance to elect the first female president. This is an election that will have a profound impact on our generation, as all of us will now graduate into Trump’s America.
For many of us — quiet masses staring at our television screens last night with mouths agape and eyes misty — this might appear to be a time of despair. This might appear to be the time to give up on a nation which seemingly has stepped decades back into its hateful past.
Despair, however, is not the answer. Now more than ever, our generation must continue the critical mass of activism that burned throughout this election season to carry America to where it should be — a progressive beacon of hope, opportunity and democratic purpose.
America let us down last night, but that does not mean we turn our back on her. In the words of Hillary Rodham Clinton, we are indeed stronger together, and by uniting in purpose, we can propel this nation back into its rightful track. Yes, there are two Americas, but we must continue to fight until we are, once again, one.

BERNIE AND YOUNG AMERICANS WERE BETRAYED BY THE MEDIA.
THIS IS A MUST READ FOR ANYONE WHO IS THINKING ABOUT WHAT JUST HAPPENED IN THE ELECTION. PLEASE CIRCULATE THIS MESSAGE ON CAMPUS!
It is hard me to believe that so many young Americans and Democrats are fearful of President Elect Donald Trump and The New Republican Party. Today’s Republican Party is the party protecting Americans rights and future. READ THIS ARTICLE.
These young people are protesting for a candidate whose message and history was that of corruption. The families Clinton Foundation is the center of the corruption. TAKE THE TIME TO READ ALL THE CLINTON FOUNDATION HISTORY OF CORRUPTION. THE OLDER GENRATION LIVED THROUGH IT THAT IS WHY THEY VOTED FOR REAL HOPE AND CHANGE.
Facts the Protesters do not know but need to hear.
AFRICAN AMERICAN CHILDREN ARE SUFFERING IN POVERTY IN THE US. THESE ARE FACTS. DO YOUR RESEARCH. PRESIDENT ELECT DONALD TRUMP LET AMARICA KNOW, 4 out of every 10 African Americans children under the age of 6 live in poverty. Think about these statistics. By the Democratic Party keeping this culture down it will create many more Americans with potential that will end up becoming in one way or another dependent on American Government. President Elect Trump offers a strong contrast to the historical norm. Let’s educate minorities, build minority infrastructure hubs and create jobs and opportunities for the minority cultures. THE MESSAGE AND PLAN IS REAL
97 MILLION AMERICANS are out of the work force. The US has about 350 Million people. The current administration was not reporting the actual facts.
The media is controlled by organizations looking to create a nationalized government. The reporters feel they are doing right because the information they are being feed by manipulated groups. Here is an Example and a dose of Truth.
 For starters, The Clinton’s used her Foundation as a way for people to gain access to Hillary’s State Department. Of the 154 people who had an audience with Secretary Clinton, 85 of them donated to her Foundation in some manner.
It is important to note that these weren’t small donors either. The 85 people gave a combined donation of $156 million to Clinton’s charity.
The Clinton Foundation has also received a number of donations which were from abusive and anti-American nations. This alone undercuts Hillary’s claim that she wanted to be a champion for minorities and women. These nations included Saudi Arabia, which has a notable ban on women operating a vehicle and is against gay rights. How many Americans are aware of this fact? The bigger question is why people especially young people would blindly follow a party and individual that was bought and paid for by special interests.
Bernie Sanders and the election process were manipulated so he did not win by the DNC. You do not hear the media talking or reporting about it. The past two DNC heads which we know about manipulated the selection process of the democratic selected candidate.
The reason Americans elected Donald Trump is because he is a true businessman and has the instinct and intelligence to lead our nation. He called out all the problems.
He is not represented properly by the media. It is propaganda. He was an amazing businessman and also in the T& A Industry. He was amazingly successful in both industries. Think about it, when a comedian develops an act, is that truly who the comedian is as a person. NO
Donald J. Trump is a true American hero. People who never stopped to research him or just blindly believed the media are being fooled. The 60 Million, Yes 60 Million American who voted for President Elect Trump, took the time to understand his true message.
Even if you doubt him, give him a chance. You will eventually look at him as an American Hero.
In history we had another President who used the same ideas to change and make America great. His name was Ronald Regan. He was a movie actor who starred in Bedtime for Bonzo. He became one of the great American Presidents in our history and helped all American People. Give President Trump a chance. Learn the real facts, Study WikiLeaks. God Bless America.
This is an opinion article for Americans to really consider.
Too little too late. Screw you.
It would appear that this paper and the so called “editors” failed to look at the New York Times exit polling based on race, age, and ethnicity. Trump won more Latino, Black, and other race votes than Mitt Romney did. In some cases 11% higher. While the increase in whites for Trump only went up 1%. So you have a baseless claim that “disenfranchised whites” won Trump Office, the facts are against you. And the continual identity politics and race baiting by this paper now and in the past is only causing a division in our society. It is the politicians who are responsible it is the press that shapes public opinions.
Not to mention he also Polled better with 18-25 year olds than Mitt Romney did as well. I see inferences to the uneducated working class whites in here. Who went heavily towards Trump, but we don’t talk about the 80+% of uneducated working class blacks that voted Hillary. Get real.
The campi of America are isloted bastions of liberalism that are desperately out of touch with American society.  You only have to look at Pac 12 school, University of Colorado that once fancied a establishing a “conservative” chair within their faculty.  It is many years since I saw a study of the faculties of western states (was a University of Oregon or Oregon State grad student thesis) with liberals holing better than 90% of the positions which is way over the top compared to our society levels.
American did not let anyone down last night.  America worked as the free country of America should work.  What makes our country so wonderful and great, is, we are a free country who gets to choose who we want to lead us, and as freedoms are suppose to work, the majority wins. We are not a North Korea where, if you don’t vote for the person in power, you are killed.  Therefore, they have elections where 100% of the people have to vote for that one person.  More than 50% of American last night did not believe that the “Progressive movement” is the beacon of hope, opportunity and democratic purpose. The freedom to vote is how Americans, regardless of privilege or economic status, maintain the power to hold their elected representatives accountable for the decisions that impact their lives.  A free society that has the opportunity to vote for which ever candidate they believe can give us beacon of hope, opportunity and purpose. So you will never have 100% of the people agree…..but the wonderful thing is, we have that opportunity to have our say in our free country, who we think is the best to run our country. Last night, the majority of our wonderful country of America, expressed that freedom.
WE ALL THE PEOPLE. BERNIE AND YOUNG AMERICANS WERE BETRAYED BY THE MEDIA.

As a conservative, I have to say this is an excellent piece by the DT. I particularly liked the discussion on the echo chamber that many university campus’s have become. Regardless of which side you are on, and echo chamber where only your own opinion is reinforced is never a good thing.
