The seventh annual USC Women’s Conference covered topics of female empowerment and the road to female success in the workforce on Thursday around the University Park campus.  The Women Thrive panel was one of many events at the conference and hosted women in the professional world, including many alumnae, who spoke about their journey to success.
The conference aimed to empower and connect women by inviting successful women in the workforce to share their stories. The theme this year was “Be Bold and Thrive!” The conference consisted of a series of events running from 9 a.m. to 5:30 p.m. There were two workshop sessions early in the day, and then the panel took place in the afternoon.
Among the speakers was Lynda Resnick, owner of Fiji Water and POM Wonderful among other companies, who said she and her husband Stewart made a promise to use their success to give back to the world.
“About 30 years ago, Stewart had the opportunity to buy what they call a ‘carbon black’ company,” Resnick said. “Yeah, we could have made a lot of money making tires or whatever the company was going to do, but we really made a decision that day … [to give] back to the Earth, not [take] away from it.”
After helping improve the infrastructure of the Central Valley town of Lost Hills, Resnick said she realized how much her work helps her give back.
“We’re all the same in this planet,” Resnick said. “Isn’t it just luck and privilege that puts us here? I never forgot one day how lucky I am, and I feel that [my] occupation is inherent in what I do to give back.”
Elizabeth Rosenbaum, film director and USC alumna, said she’s had to adapt to the climate of the business world in order to find success.
“The way I’ve felt like I’ve navigated through the landscape is to go against my own nature. I was raised to be very polite and to, you know, not be too pushy … [But] that’s not how you have to behave in the film industry,” Rosenbaum said.
In addition, Rosenbaum explained how being rejected from jobs and projects has helped push her to where she is today.
“I’m not deterred by rejection, and I think that’s something that’s very against my nature and a lot of my girlfriends’ as well,” Rosenbaum said. “For me, I’ve had to turn my whole attitude from getting rejected as kind of like a dare or a fun challenge, because otherwise you would be under your covers every day in this industry. Whatever is on my bio, there’s 10 times more things I’ve gone up for that I didn’t get, and that’s hard sometimes, but I’ve started to kind of enjoy it.”
USC alumna Sara Happ, founder and CEO of Sara Happ Inc., a cosmetics line known for popularizing the lip scrub, said the toughest thing about having a business is preparing for failure.
“I think what’s toughest about it is forcing problems before they happen and being calm and having a plan in place for when they do,” Happ said. “You want the best outcome … but it’s being prepared for the failures that will inevitably happen and being really, really optimistic and taking big risks that are calculated right and then planning for when it all goes wrong.”
Compton Mayor Aja Brown, a USC alumna, said she wanted to be the city’s mayor because every city deserves a good leader.
“I was discontent about the way my city looked, and I just think that every person deserves to live in a community that has everything that it needs and it deserves to have great leadership,” Brown said. “After trying to convince some decent people that I know to run, they all pointed the fingers back at me, so I decided to take the challenge and I stepped out there, and about a year later I won.”
Brown said she believes she won the election by being genuine to voters.
“In my experience as an urban planner, I have been able to get some great projects done and give [back to] the communities I served,” Brown said. “I had a track record … I was truly just a person that had done the work and was really able to see what the issues were and provided a plan.”
According to Brown, women shouldn’t wait for opportunity. Instead, she encouraged leaders to step up and take positions.
“Don’t wait for someone to invite you to run for office, because they never will,” Brown said. “If you think that you have the leadership skills and you’re passionate about it … you need to step in and fill that role, because people need great leaders, and I think women naturally are just amazing leaders and you really have the tools enabling to bring people together.”

The class of 2015 voted to support USC Troy Camp with its senior class gift.
According to a press release from USC’s Office of Annual Giving, this year’s poll had the closest vote in senior gift history. Out of the four different organizations, USC Troy Camp narrowly won with 35 percent of the total votes.
The JEP Community Van was the runner-up with 33 percent, followed by USC Good Neighbors with 19 percent and USC Friends and Neighbors Day with 13 percent of the votes.
“The USC senior gift is a time-honored tradition that unifies each graduating class and recognizes its unique contribution to USC,” according to the senior gift page on the USC website. “The USC Senior Gift provides an opportunity for each senior to foster their long identity as a member of the Trojan Family.”
Troy Camp is one of the oldest and largest student-run philanthropies on campus, according to its website. It provides mentoring and leadership programs for students in South Los Angeles.
This year’s Senior Gift Advisory Board is aiming to set a new record for participation in the senior gift with 97 percent of the graduating class, in hopes of raising $20,000. The senior gift campaign begins on March 23 and will end on June 30.

Tommy Talks hosted the first ever SpeakEasy event in the Annenberg Innovation Lab on Thursday night, featuring speeches by students Ariel Sobel and Dylan Deluca about social issues of importance to students.
Tommy Talks had previously hosted larger speaker events, usually featuring three to four speakers who spoke for about 20 minutes each.  They wanted something more relaxed and social, however, so they inaugurated the SpeakEasy series on Thursday night.
The idea behind SpeakEasy is to give students the chance to come together and share their experiences. Madisen Keavy and Anna Skelsey, the two students leading the event, wanted it to be more of an open conversation about whatever students wanted to discuss.
“We want to provide a space where [students] can talk about things that are irking and exciting to people,” Keavy said that in order to achieve this, the organizers prompted speakers and students to talk about what they were most passionate about.
Skelsey started off the event with a speed dating activity, so that all the attendees could meet each other before the speeches started.  She wanted to create a sense of community, respect and trust before the conversation got going.
The event was conducted as an open forum. Ariel Sobel, a sophomore majoring in writing for screen and television, spoke about how saying “thank you” has become uncomfortable for this generation and students used this speech to strike up conversation.
“My generation has grown to fear saying ‘thank you,’” Sobel said. Her speech focused on how “thank you” has grown to encourage us to feel guilty and it makes it difficult to value ourselves.  She also mentioned how it is difficult for women to have self-confidence because they always feel like they don’t deserve compliments.
“My generation of women is not entitled to feel good about themselves,” she said. “I wear makeup to conceal my flaws, not to play up the good things.”
Shane Mileham, a junior majoring in computer science, said that men experience a similar feeling, but diffuse it through jokes.
“You can’t make a joke about something that you’re good at. The jokes you make about stuff you’re good at are suddenly not funny; they are conceited,” he said.
Skelsey agreed, she thought that people are constantly putting themselves down in order to compliment someone else.  To make sure that everyone knew their value, Skelsey encouraged the group to brag about the things they had done to get into USC.
One student started his first company when he was 13.  Another volunteered at the soup kitchen by his house every week for his entire senior year.  A student from India started a dance society in her high school within three weeks because there wasn’t one. One by one, students were asked to brag about themselves so they could realize their true value.
Sobel then concluded the talk by encouraging the students to accept that they are really good at things.
“You should not make yourself small to make other people feel bigger,” she said.
Sobel’s speech was followed by a speech by Dylan Deluca, a freshman studying communication and cinema, who talked about the moment he came out as gay in high school. Deluca talked about how he thought that coming out was a worse experience than he had imagined.
“Coming out was like being branded with a pink sparkly letter that elevated me from the level of normality to the level of novelty, a posh accessory that could be toted around like the last season’s hottest purse,” he said.
That started another group discussion, one about how people are often branded for what they do and not for what they are.  “Being a blonde girl in the University of Southern California’s Greek System carries a lot of connotations, but that doesn’t define me,” Skelsey said.
Aneesha Madhok, a freshman studying theatre, was inspired by the novelty of SpeakEasy.
“It allows people to actually stand up for themselves and actually address issues that you won’t really address on a daily basis.”

It might be the beginning of March, but the USC football team is gearing up for the 2015 season with guns blazing and 50 Cent blaring on the loudspeakers. For players, spring practice is a time of mental and physical preparation, learning the playbook and bonding with teammates.
Spring practice features an environment unlike any other. The nonstop adrenaline from coaches, trainers, players and managers is on show as the team gears up for the spring game on April 11.
On Thursday, players participated in position-oriented drills, sprints and a number of dynamic stretching exercises. They then went into game scenarios with the offense facing the defense — minus the contact of course. Redshirt senior quarterback Cody Kessler has clearly picked up where he left off last season. Kessler threw for more than 3,800 yards in 2014 and posted a remarkable 39 to 5 touchdown-interception ratio. Kessler looked to be in a good rhythm with his receivers during Thursday’s practice, as did soon-to-be redshirt sophomore signal caller Max Browne.
Kessler lost his primary target in dynamic senior wide receiver Nelson Agholor, who connected with Kessler a whopping 104 times this season. Agholor is off to the NFL, but freshman wide receiver JuJu Smith looks poised to become the team’s top receiver in 2015. Smith racked up 724 receiving yards in 2014, wearing the storied No. 9 jersey previously worn by former USC star wideout Marqise Lee.
Speaking of Lee, he and former USC wide receiver Robert Woods were in attendance on Thursday, pacing the sidelines and appearing to be just as locked into practice as the players wearing helmets out on the field. Lee and Woods comprised arguably the most formidable wide receiver duo in all of college football in 2011 and 2012. It would not be a surprise to see the Trojans’ passing attack put up stellar numbers in 2015, though, as Kessler is a wily veteran who has returned for the final act of what has been an outstanding career thus far.
USC’s aerial attack should be prolific, especially seeing as Smith should be even more dominant this upcoming season. Sophomore wide receiver Darreus Rogers is another player to watch out for in 2015, as his production (245 yards, four touchdowns) should increase this year.
Of course, freshman cornerback Adoree’ Jackson should be electrifying on both sides of the ball again in his sophomore season, assuming he continues to play wide receiever on offense as well. A major storyline this off-season will be whether or not Jackson is leaning towards exclusively playing one of the positions, but he is so talented at both that Trojan fans will likely see the dynamic playmaker all over the field again in 2015.
Kessler, and the entire offense for that matter, looked sharp and displayed noticeable chemistry in spring practice. Of course, the defense does not have the opportunity to make any tackles during these  contact-free practices, but some excellent players are filling in the holes from this past season’s departures. Former linebacker Hayes Pullard is currently preparing for the NFL, but his successor appears to be Lamar Dawson, who will be a redshirt senior in the fall. Dawson missed the second half of the 2013 season and all of the 2014 campaign. Dawson is thrilled to be back on the field and looks like he will fill the void at “Mike” inside linebacker, the role Pullard filled previously. The defense reacted to a big play at the end of practice, and while he may not have been visible in the conglomeration of white shirts, one can only assume that he was in there celebrating with the rest of the defense.
“We like to compete with each other,” Dawson said. “We just want to make sure we are finishing at the end of practices.”
This kind of laser focus is not lost on Dawson’s fellow linebacker Jabari Ruffin. Ruffin has been impressed by the level of play from the defense thus far. “The biggest strength of this defense is just how hungry we are,” Ruffin said. “We want to win.”
The energy at spring practice is contagious. Every big play, whether it is a circus catch by a receiver or a well-diagnosed play leading to an interception by a linebacker merits an enthusiastic reaction from the players. Even some die-hard Trojan fans were in the stands at practice, frantically checking their rosters in hand to see who had just made the         jaw-dropping play on the field.
Even though there are still six months before the Trojans face Arkansas State in the season opener, getting into this kind of rhythm and building this kind of camaraderie in March will not hurt the Trojans’ cause.

With spending on intercollegiate athletics at an all-time high, universities around the country will stop at nothing to put themselves ahead of the pack. Whether it’s state-of-the-art facilities or flashy, over-the-top jerseys, colleges will do everything in their power to win the arms race.
The concept of an arms race in collegiate sports, also known as exorbitant spending on intercollegiate athletics, has been around for quite some time. The concept has become increasingly popular as of late with the success of schools like Oregon and Boise State. Both schools struggled historically in football before embracing this new technique.
Oregon, which prides itself on wearing a different jersey combination each game, has become a national powerhouse due to improved recruiting, though a brand-new practice facility didn’t hurt the Ducks, either. Meanwhile, Boise State was able to increase its recruiting efforts and join the national conversation by becoming known for its blue turf and flashy uniforms.
USC, a football powerhouse since the 1930s, has even joined the arms race. In 2012, it opened a brand-new $70 million athletic facility, the John McKay Center, to aid in recruiting, and it worked. Despite heavy sanctions, the Trojans were able to bring in a string of solid freshman classes. Even former coach Lane Kiffin highlighted the importance of improving facilities.
“It does help in recruiting,” Kiffin told NBC Sports in 2012. “It helped with last year’s class, just them knowing that this process was being done, that they’d be in that building. It does have an impact on recruiting. It has already had an impact on [the last couple of] classes.”
There is a line that USC must not cross when it comes to the arms race, however. Last week, reports surfaced that the football program was considering new helmets with a drastically changed logo. The Trojan face, which normally sits in the middle of the helmet, would now be blown up and cover the entire helmet, similar to how Arizona State’s pitchfork engulfs their helmet. This came after the deemed success of changing the usual cardinal helmet to a glossy red last season.
Most schools that have embraced changing their uniforms are schools that have struggled historically. Schools like Oregon and Boise State have no history, no championships and before this year, no Heisman winners.
Meanwhile, USC has one of the richest histories with 11 national championships, six Heisman winners and more first-round draft picks than any other school.
The Trojans, however,  have essentially played with the same uniform combination since their inception. The change to “shiny” helmets this past year made me sick to my stomach.
You don’t see other powerhouses such as Alabama, Ohio State or Penn State messing around with uniform changes or shiny helmets. These programs know what their uniform stands for: history.
Flashy uniforms aren’t what sells an athlete to join a program. It’s the years of legacy, the championships, the professional players that all play into that consideration. I recently had the privilege to take a tour of the Coliseum for my journalism class. One area that had a lasting effect on me was the recruiting lounge.
Upon entering the room, you are greeted by a large wall detailing all of USC’s accomplishments. If you turn to the right, you’ll see a wall with all the names of the Heisman winners, from Charles White to Marcus Allen to Matt Leinart. In the large standing area to the left of the entrance, there are pictures of all the USC players currently playing in the NFL.
These are images that resonate with recruits who are considering where to spend their next three to four years.
Instead of changing what has worked for so long, USC should embrace its history, one not many schools can compare with.
As USC showed this year, it can still recruit with the best of the best. There’s no need to jump to a tactic that schools with no winning history have used to try to jump-start their programs.
When it comes to college football, USC is a staple in the minds of many. The Trojans have so many things that sell themselves. If a recruit really cares that much about flashiness, then he isn’t meant for the Trojan lifestyle. USC has and always will be about one thing: winning championships.

After sweeping Colorado in its two regular season matches by a combined 35 points, the USC women’s basketball team looked to make it three-for-three as it prepared to defend its reign as Pac-12 Tournament champions, but Colorado had other plans in mind.
No. 8 seed USC went cold late in the first half and was unable to overcome the halftime deficit, as No. 9 seed Colorado took out the defending       Pac-12 champions 75-63 at KeyArena in Seattle, Washington.
Junior guard Brianna Barrett led USC (15-15, 7-11 Pac-12) with 18 points, four rebounds, three assists and two steals. Sophomore guard Jordan Adams and senior forward Kaneisha Horn scored 10 points apiece, along with seven and six rebounds, respectively.
Senior forward Alexyz Vaioletama, USC’s leading scorer with 12.3 points per game, was held in check by the Buffaloes. She finished with four points and seven rebounds on 0-of-13 shooting.
Haley Smith led four double-digit scorers for Colorado (14-16, 6-12 Pac-12) with 16 points. Jamee Swan added 15 points, five rebounds and four blocks, while Lexy Kresl finished with 12 points, seven assists and five rebounds.
The two squads played an extremely close, physical game at the start, as the largest lead in the first eight and a half minutes was a mere three points. A lob to beat the shot-clock by Horn cut the Buffaloes’ lead to 15-14, but things would change from there. Colorado would get hot, using a 13-4 run to break the game open, while USC was unable to get the shots to fall. A 7-2 run by USC got them back into it, but the Buffaloes made some shots late to hold the advantage.
The Buffaloes would enter the half with a 39-27 lead, thanks in part to 58 percent shooting from the field. USC kept up their strong offensive rebounding, picking up 11 in the first half. It didn’t translate into points, as the Women of Troy only landed 23 percent of their shots. Colorado outrebounded USC at halftime 19-18.
“We absolutely have to have a sense of urgency,” head coach Cynthia Cooper-Dyke said at halftime. “We’ve got to attack the basket, but more than just take shots, we’ve got to finish shots. It’s important that we move the ball from one side of the floor to the other. We’re getting bogged down on one side of the floor and trying to make things happen. Get the ball, reverse the ball, and try and make things happen.”
Halftime came at the perfect time for USC, as the Women of Troy came out strong in the second half, jumping out to an 8-2 run and looking like a completely different team from the end of the first half. However, the Buffaloes started warming up again, keeping the Women of Troy from getting too close. A 13-5 run by Colorado midway through the second half gave them a 16-point lead, their largest of the game to that point.
The Women of Troy made a late push to try and mount the comeback, taking advantage of the Buffaloes’ early foul trouble, but were unable to hit enough shots to overcome the early deficit.
“Every time we made a run, Colorado came back and either got to the free-throw line or knocked down a three-point shot,” Cooper said.
Efficiency was the key for the Buffaloes, who shot 53 percent from the field for the game, 71 percent from behind-the-arc and 87 percent from the charity stripe, compared to 29 percent, 17 percent and 63 percent for USC, respectively. USC outrebounded Colorado 41-38, including 23-6 on the offensive glass, and committed only seven turnovers compared to the Buffaloes’ 17.
“We have a lot of really good freshmen,” Adams said about the future of the team. “We’re not losing half of our team, so I think we’ll have a good foundation.”
The Buffaloes will play No. 1 seed Oregon State (26-3, 16-2 Pac-12) in the quarterfinals on Friday, March 6 pm on the Pac-12 Network. USC is not projected to earn a spot in the NCAA tournament but has a chance to earn a spot in the WNIT.

With the exceptions of George Lucas and the late Stanley Kubrick, no filmmaker has done more to popularize science fiction than Ridley Scott. His two greatest achievements, Alien and Blade Runner, are universally acknowledged as classics of the genre, pop cultural touchstones whose thematic and stylistic influence cannot be overstated. Both movies are due to receive extremely belated sequels within the next few years, and each will be helmed by a talented up-and-coming director. The similarities end there, however, because while Alien deserves a quality follow-up, Blade Runner demands to be left alone.
Why, you ask? First of all, Alien is already an established franchise. The original film, which burst onto screens in the summer of 1979, remains a note-perfect synthesis of horror and science fiction, a futuristic twist on the “old dark house” narrative — a group of people are trapped in an enclosed environment and targeted for death by a malevolent entity — that relied on atmosphere, tension and H.R. Giger’s nightmarish creature designs to terrify audiences. It also introduced viewers to the courageous, no-nonsense Ellen Ripley (Sigourney Weaver), the last survivor of the doomed ship Nostromo and one of cinema’s first true action heroines.
James Cameron’s 1986 sequel Aliens expanded the world and drastically altered the tone of the series, swapping claustrophobic, slow-burn horror for the red meat gristle of a war movie. The result was a hit with audiences and critics alike, and Weaver found herself in the running for a Best Actress Oscar after Ripley revealed a softer side, rescuing the orphaned Newt (Carrie Henn) from a horde of ravenous “xenomorphs” and trading banter with the irascible Corporal Dwayne Hicks (Michael Biehn) and the selfless android Bishop (Lance Henriksen). Ripley’s maternal bond with Newt culminates in an epic showdown with the monstrous alien queen, a standout sequence that would stand as the apex of Stan Winston’s visual effects wizardry prior to Jurassic Park in 1993.
After the success of Aliens, the quality of the series quickly went downhill. David Fincher has since matured into a masterful filmmaker, but his debut feature Alien 3 is a slick, soulless slog through hell that dispatches beloved characters with what amounts to glib nihilism. Jean-Pierre Jeunet’s much-maligned Alien: Resurrection, with its failed Ripley clones and silly-looking alien-human hybrids, actually succeeds at being an amiably bizarre space opera — Joss Whedon penned the predictably snarky screenplay — but it’s far too in love with its own half-baked cleverness to measure up to the works of Scott and Cameron.
Now, 36 years after the release of Alien and on the heels of Scott’s polarizing but visually resplendent pseudo-prequel Prometheus, Fox has announced that the franchise’s fifth installment, currently slated for a 2017 release date, will be directed by Neill Blomkamp, the South African auteur behind District 9 and the newly released Chappie. The director, a longtime fan of the series who attracted the studio’s interest after posting homemade concept art featuring an older Ripley and a battle-scarred Hicks, should prove an excellent choice to revive the brand, which has been diluted after years of subpar video games, last year’s Alien: Isolation notwithstanding, and two dismal Alien vs. Predator movies.
Blomkamp’s work has the same lived-in, blue-collar aesthetic that made Scott and Cameron’s films so visually distinctive from the gleaming future-scapes of their genre contemporaries in the late ’70s and ’80s, and he has demonstrated a real knack for orchestrating character-driven carnage on a massive scale without losing the plot, even though he came perilously close in the ham-fisted third act of Elysium.
Even more exciting, both Weaver, who worked with Blomkamp on Chappie, and Biehn have expressed interest in signing up for the project, leading to widespread fan speculation that the events of Alien 3 and Alien: Resurrection are being ret-conned in favor of an alternate timeline, a storytelling mea culpa typically reserved for the cluttered mythologies of comic books. I personally hope the rumors are true, mainly because it would allow for the return of Henrikson’s Bishop, whose charm and naivete always served as a nice conversational counterbalance to Ripley’s take-no-prisoners attitude.
So what about Blade Runner? The 1982 neo-noir is every bit as celebrated and influential as Alien, and it’s never received any kind of follow-up before (with the exception of three non-canonical novels written by K.W. Jeter), so why isn’t the news of its sequel being greeted with more elan? For the majority of fans, the major sticking point is the decision to have Harrison Ford reprise his role as replicant hunter Rick Deckard.
The original film’s ending leaves it purposely vague as to whether or not Deckard himself is a replicant, an android with a tragically short lifespan of four years. In fact, the debate has raged among film fans for decades, spurred on by Scott’s decision to continually release different versions of the movie, including 2007’s definitive “Final Cut,” which contains omitted dialogue snippets and some choice dream imagery of a unicorn. Having Deckard appear as an older man will effectively ruin one of the greatest unsolved mysteries in the history of cinema. It would be comparable to Quentin Tarantino revealing the contents of Marcellus Wallace’s briefcase in Pulp Fiction or Christopher Nolan allowing Cobb’s totem to topple at the end of Inception. There’s simply no need.
Is there a way to make a Blade Runner sequel the fan base can get behind? Perhaps. Just as the Alien franchise had to make do without the Ellen Ripley character for the better part of 18 years, the world of Blade Runner goes far beyond the trials and tribulations of one lonely, soul-sick executioner. As the old saying goes, there are eight million stories in the naked city. We’ve only heard one. Hopefully the sequel’s director Denis Villeneuve, who brought such wicked intensity to the kidnapping drama Prisoners and last year’s identity crisis thriller Enemy, can find another worth telling.

It is widely acknowledged that USC is home to many celebrities. From film stars to best-selling novelists to Olympic athletes, USC faculty and students are no strangers to fame. Now, the same can be said of the USC hospitality staff.
Josh Trovato of the Parkside residential dining hall is a contestant on the newest season of Hell’s Kitchen.
Hell’s Kitchen is a cooking competition hosted by Gordon Ramsay, a notorious British celebrity chef. Ramsay eliminates a contestant each week, and the winning chef receives a head chef position at a well-known restaurant. The show is now in its 14th season.
Originally from New Jersey, Trovato studied at Johnson and Wales University in North Carolina, graduating cum laude in 2010. At Johnson and Wales, Trovato founded a hockey team and was dedicated to his schoolwork. After graduation, he moved to New York City, where he landed a job with Danny Boome, a chef with his own reality show on the Food Network. He credits Boome for giving him a glimpse into how food and television could be combined. Working his way up the ladder, Trovato got a position as head chef at Tree Bistro and eventually a restaurant management job in Times Square. Still, he found himself wanting more from life.
“I began questioning myself, wondering if what I was doing was enough, and it wasn’t,” Trovato said. “So I decided to get into acting.”
After landing small roles in films such as The Wolf of Wall Street and The Amazing Spider Man 2, Trovato found a new passion for being in front of the camera, but was still enthusiastic about food, too. “Being able to combine them was my new goal,” Trovato said.
He found an advertisement for Hell’s Kitchen casting on Craigslist, and after many rounds of auditioning, Trovato was thrilled to be chosen as a contestant on the show.
“You have to have a certain entertainment value to get on the show,” Trovato said. “You have to be watchable. If no one wants to watch you, you’re not going to get on the show.”
After first moving to L.A. for filming, Trovato decided to stay permanently. He was enamored with the people, the weather and the natural beauty of California.
“I said I would never do another winter,” Trovato said. “California is my destiny. I think God brought me here.”
He credits Hell’s Kitchen with bringing him to L.A. and said it was the best experience of his life thus far.
Trovato said that even though the show has not aired yet, it has changed his life for the better.
“It led me to California. I feel at home here. It put me on path for the rest of my life,” Trovato says.
Even though he cannot disclose how far he has made it on the show, it is clear that it has had a tremendous impact on his life. He believes that the show has allowed him to succeed to a point he could never have imagined reaching at age 26.
Working with Ramsay was a dream come true for Trovato.
“He is probably the coolest guy in the world,” Trovato says. “He has such a presence. He has an aura. You really want to impress him.”
Though he doesn’t want to disclose too much, Trovato did say that his interactions with the chef would be fun to watch. He said that a true friendship with Ramsay came out of doing the show, and that he learned so much just by being around Ramsay.
Luckily for USC students who eat at Parkside, Trovato brings what he learned from Ramsay to work each day.
“I try to teach the guys at Parkside the stuff I learned from him. That’s pretty cool, to say you’ve eaten food inspired and taught by Gordon Ramsay. Not many people can say that,” Trovato said.
Trovato enjoys sharing what he has learned about cooking, management and the food industry with students. USC management, his employees and the students have all been very encouraging and are excited to see him on TV, according to Trovato. Since he had to keep the show a secret for a long time, Trovato said he is relieved to share his excitement with his coworkers and the students. “They make me even more pumped for it to air. I am so glad we can enjoy it together,” Trovato said.
USC also threw a viewing party at URBNMRKT for the show’s season premiere on March 3.
“USC has been so amazing to me … from the job, to the premiere party, everything they’ve done for me,” Trovato said. “I can’t thank them enough. USC is a great place to be, whether a worker or a student.”
Hell’s Kitchen airs on Tuesdays at 8 p.m. on FOX.

Though discrimination based on religion, race or sex dominates many disputes, one particular court case receiving a significant amount of attention is Equal Employment Opportunity Commission v. Abercrombie & Fitch Stores, Inc., which was argued before the Supreme Court last week. In 2008, Samantha Elauf, then a 17-year-old Muslim girl, was denied a sales model position at retailer Abercrombie & Fitch because of her hijab, or headscarf. Elauf and the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission brought a lawsuit against the retailer, and a lower court sided with Elauf. Since Abercrombie won on appeal, however, the case was taken up by the Supreme Court. Looking at the combination of Abercrombie’s famously employed “Look Policy,” Abercrombie’s legal history, Elauf’s interview and Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, one could conclude that Abercrombie & Fitch has denied Elauf a job based on her religious affiliation, a gross act of discrimination.
Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 states that it is illegal to “fail or refuse to hire or to discharge any individual … because of such individual’s race, color, religion, sex or national origin.” The Supreme Court’s decision on this case could force society to rethink the balance between religious rights and employer responsibility. This is not the first time Abercrombie’s actions have landed the company in a headscarf-related lawsuit. In 2008, a woman named Halla Banafa claimed that a manager at Abercrombie’s Milpitas, California, location chose not to hire her because of her headscarf. In a similar case, Umme Hani Khan, who worked at one of the company’s Hollister stores in San Francisco, was fired in 2010 after a district manager ordered Khan to remove her hijab.
Abercrombie’s decision not to hire Elauf could have been because of her lack of qualifications, not her headscarf. Nevertheless, the assistant manager who interviewed Elauf gave her solid marks on the three “competencies” outlined in Abercrombie’s Look Policy required for the job of sales model: “outgoing and promotes diversity,” “sophistication and aspiration,” and “appearance and sense of style.”
Elauf said that at the end of her interview with Abercrombie, the assistant manger told her that they would call her about orientation in a few days. Heather Cooke, the assistant manager who interviewed Elauf, explained that her conversation with her boss started with a discussion about Elauf’s religious headscarf and ended with the decision not to hire her or inform her of the new decision. Abercrombie denies that its decision had to do with Elauf’s religious affiliation, instead contending that her appearance would impact its brand identity. However, it seems as if these decisions are only hurting the brand and labeling Abercrombie as a discriminatory employer. A job applicant’s hiring should be based upon her qualifications and passion rather than her choice of dress, especially dress related to religion.
Some have noted that taking off the headscarf is not a difficult adjustment to make and a decent sacrifice to be made for a job. Undermining the religious value of wearing a headscarf, however, should not be the price to pay for a job that would not impact the customer experience at an Abercrombie store. Because the interviewer and her boss specifically spoke about Elauf’s religious headscarf being the deciding factor of her employment, it is clear that Abercrombie & Fitch has repeated religious discrimination against an employee.
Though some argue that there are bigger problems to deal with and that it is easier to disregard discrimination cases like these altogether, it is still important to treat every discriminatory act, large or small, as an indication that discrimination is an ongoing battle that cannot be ignored.
As long as the Muslim population remains around 1% of any given country they
will be regarded as a peace-loving minority and not as a threat to anyone. In
fact, they may be featured in articles and films, stereotyped for their
colorful uniqueness:
United States — Muslim 1.0%
Australia — Muslim 1.5%
Canada — Muslim 1.9%
China — Muslim 1%-2%
Italy — Muslim 1.5%
Norway — Muslim 1.8% 
At 2% and 3% they begin to proselytize from other ethnic minorities and
disaffected groups with major recruiting from the jails and among street gangs:
Denmark — Muslim 2%
Germany — Muslim 3.7%
United Kingdom — Muslim 2.7%
Spain — Muslim 4%
Thailand — Muslim 4.6% 
From 5% on they exercise an inordinate influence in proportion to their
percentage of the population. They will push for the introduction of halal
(clean by Islamic standards) food, thereby securing food preparation jobs for
Muslims. They will increase pressure on supermarket chains to feature it on
their shelves — along with threats for failure to comply.
France — Muslim 8%
Philippines — Muslim 5%
Sweden — Muslim 5%
Switzerland — Muslim 4.3%
The Netherlands — Muslim 5.5%
Trinidad & Tobago — Muslim 5.8%
At this point, they will work to get the ruling government to allow them to
rule themselves under Sharia, the Islamic Law. The ultimate goal of Islam is
not to convert the world but to establish Sharia law over the entire world. 
When Muslims reach 10% of the population, they will increase lawlessness as
a means of complaint about their conditions (Paris — car burnings, etc.). Any
non-Muslim action that offends Islam will result in uprisings and threats
(Amsterdam — Mohammed cartoons).
Guyana — Muslim 10%
India — Muslim 13.4%
Israel — Muslim 16%
Kenya — Muslim 10%
Russia — Muslim 10-15% 
After reaching 20% expect hair-trigger rioting, jihad militia formations,
sporadic killings and church and synagogue burning:
Ethiopia — Muslim 32.8%
At 40% you will find widespread massacres, chronic terror attacks and ongoing
militia warfare:
Bosnia — Muslim 40%
Chad — Muslim 53.1%
Lebanon — Muslim 59.7% 
From 60% you may expect unfettered persecution of non-believers and other
religions, sporadic ethnic cleansing (genocide), use of Sharia Law as a weapon
and Jizya, the tax placed on infidels:
Albania — Muslim 70%
Malaysia — Muslim 60.4%
Qatar — Muslim 77.5%
Sudan — Muslim 70% 
After 80% expect State run ethnic cleansing and genocide:
Bangladesh — Muslim 83%
Egypt — Muslim 90%
Gaza — Muslim 98.7%
Indonesia — Muslim 86.1%
Iran — Muslim 98%
Iraq — Muslim 97%
Jordan — Muslim 92%
Morocco — Muslim 98.7%
Pakistan — Muslim 97%
Syria — Muslim 90%
Tajikistan — Muslim 90%
Turkey — Muslim 99.8%
United Arab Emirates — Muslim 96% 
100% will usher in the peace of “Dar-es-Salaam” — the Islamic House of Peace
— there’s supposed to be peace because everybody is a Muslim:
Afghanistan — Muslim 100%
Saudi Arabia — Muslim 100%
Somalia — Muslim 100%
Yemen — Muslim 99.9% 
Of course, that’s not the case. To satisfy their blood lust, Muslims then
start killing each other for a variety of reasons.

It is exceedingly difficult to get most people in my generation, the millennials, to care about politics. What isn’t difficult is getting us to care about results. Bridging the gap between the process of politics, which doesn’t interest us, and the outcome, which does, holds the key to voter apathy, particularly among the young folks that older generations frequently complain about.
To see why, look at how we spend most of our time. We are a group that constantly plugs into our devices (an average of 43 times a day, according to Entrepreneuer), but rarely to connect with one another. In fact, the term “social media” might be the most misleading concept label of the decade, mostly because when people are on Facebook or Twitter, they are anything but social. In reality, most of us do it to escape. We scroll through Facebook newsfeeds during class, meetings and meals, and we sink into the lands of Pandora or Spotify as soon as we get up from the table.
The implication of all of this is that we aren’t using our powerful potential as a generational force to reshape politics. Consider this week’s column a call to change that. I’m certainly not asking everyone to become political gurus, but I think more people need to be invested in the process.
Our lack of connection to the world could not come at a worse time. One of the most significant threats to global stability, ISIS, is fighting a war of ideas in the Middle East that is founded upon principles of hate and intolerance and strengthened by world leaders who fight back with brute force and more intolerance. Congressional leaders such as John Boehner are also dutifully ignoring climate change, another monstrous threat to world safety, because they “aren’t scientists.”
And yet, overwhelming polling data shows that millennials are both more tolerant and more environmentally conscious than generations before. These are just two snapshot examples, but the point I’m making is that our elected officials need to hear our important voice. For some reason, however, we aren’t willing to speak.
Bob Shrum, a veteran political strategist and former speechwriter for Ted Kennedy and Bill Clinton, summarized it for me this way: “They can invent a 21st century politics and a 21st century America, but they have to be engaged.” And then, the big question: “If they don’t, who will?”
Inventing a 21st century politics starts with two acknowledgements. First, most of us don’t have the window of opportunity for 24/7 politics. Most of the time, I write about wonky policy issues, and I know it will only reach a very small slice of folks. Second, no one expects us to know everything about every issue, and we don’t need to. Those people might win episodes of Jeopardy!, but the rest of us just need to use the knowledge we do have in more creative and active ways.
For those who do bleed politics, rebranding participation is the lynchpin to the solution — we have to get past the notion that volunteering for a nonprofit or becoming outraged on Facebook satisfies our political obligation, because it doesn’t. It will continue to make the majority of important decisions that will shape our lives as long as we live in this country, and we have to be a part of them, be it through attending town hall meetings on issues we care about or taking a specific action that we know will have tangible results. Consider the Internet: While great innovators like Steve Jobs and Bill Gates helped commercialize the Internet, it was invented by the United States military, and only later did it become available to the public.
But the Internet has been responsible for as much disconnection as it has connection. To use it well, technology has to connect us to results and let us know we are making change. In June, when Last Week Tonight host John Oliver urged viewers to comment on the Federal Communications Commission website ahead of a major Internet regulation decision, he bridged that gap. Around 45,000 individuals (I’d wager mostly millennials) finally knew that they could act on something they cared about and see results — the FCC website received so many comments that it crashed for a day, and last week it approved the regulations Oliver called for.
The fulcrum this all turns on is what a friend described to me recently as “actionable intelligence.” For us millennials, it’s hard to engage in public policy just for the sake of doing it. We’d rather do it for the sake of seeing real results, which requires being provided the knowledge that what we do is being heard and acted upon. The challenge for older generations is this: If you want our involvement, you have to do more than give us articles to share, and you have to stop wondering how to “make us care.” It’s the difference between voices on the echo chamber of Facebook and public comments that shut down the FCC’s website.

Facebook just recently implemented a new suicide prevention plan that aims to identify people who may be feeling suicidal. Friends can report whether someone has written a concerning post, and that will generate an automated response to direct that person to available options for help. The new tool has great potential to save lives, and demonstrates that social media platforms can make a difference in the fight against cyberbullying.
In the Digital Age, the increasing presence and power of social media, such as Facebook, Twitter and Ask.fm, is a phenomenon that millennials in particular have embraced. Yet, the usage of social media is not without its risks. Sites such as Ask.fm have been said to facilitate online bullying, having been linked to at least nine suicides teenagers between 2012 and 2013.
The Internet provides a screen of anonymity for bullies and this encourages them to push their behaviour to extremes. Children or teenagers who cyberbully are often bullies in real life too. Social media platforms just provide another means for bullies to attack their victim. Indeed, Mark Terebin, one of the founders of Ask.fm, argued that social media platforms are “just a tool which helps people to communicate with each other, same as any other social network, same as phone, same as piece of paper and pen.” He adds that it is up to individuals to take responsibility for their actions because people make their own decisions when it comes to their behaviour online. Social media platforms are merely neutral spaces that can be corrupted and used for ill such as cyberbullying, or be a tool for change and used for good, such as bringing awareness to ALS.
Social media platforms have already made progress towards increasing safety on the web. Facebook, as mentioned above, has implemented its suicide prevention plan and Ask.fm has made its ‘Report’ button larger to make it easier to report online abuse and hired more staff to more vigorously moderate comments. Mark Terebin, one of the founders of Ask.fm, argues that it is “just a tool which helps people to communicate with each other, same as any other social network, same as phone, same as piece of paper and pen.” He adds that it is up to individuals to take responsibility for their actions.
But cyberbullying and suicides linked to social media won’t end if only one party takes responsibility for the problem. Cyberbullying is a societal problem that won’t be going away in the near future. At the very least, we can all try to minimise the harm from all sides — at an individual, school and company-wide level — to take a little time and effort and stop those cyberbullies.

Even when you’re spending your semester abroad an ocean away, headache-inducing responsibilities like figuring out housing for the next year will follow you around. Luckily enough, I’m spending my time in the heart of Seoul. In what seems rare for a city that has achieved its level of urbanization, Seoul is surrounded by hills and mountains, many offering convenient escapes from the rush of city life. One such convenient site is Gwanak-san, which lies right behind Seoul National University, a short subway and bus-ride from Yonsei University.
Wanting to get some fresh air, I set out for an exploratory hike at Gwanak-san (which translates to Gwanak Mountain) with my roommate. It turned out that we weren’t the only people with the idea in mind. While I wasn’t entirely certain about how to get to Gwanak-san and which routes to take, a stream of people visibly prepared to go hiking greeted my roommate and I as we got off our subway train and made our way to the street. When in doubt, following the crowd isn’t necessarily a bad way to start.
Hiking culture is popular in Seoul and you can tell by the way people are outfitted – head to toe in apparel specifically designed for hiking, as well as outdoor backpacks that appear to be stuffed. As my roommate and I progress on our hike, the contents of the backpacks are revealed to most likely be food. While hiking in Korea is a way to exercise and maybe let off any pent-up frustrations stemming from city life, it’s also a way to gather with old friends and share a good time with them by stopping at an appropriately cleared area and spreading out a picnic. Also, once you hike up far enough, you can observe Seoul’s metropolitan sprawl through the fog — not necessarily pretty, but the city views are impressive.
I find it worth noting that most people out at Gwanak-san that day were older, maybe around the same age as your parents or even grandparents, but I also saw a few college couples, as well as parents with children. Sure, hiking isn’t the hip thing to do in a city like Seoul, but nature doesn’t fail to attract admirers, young or old. Spending a few hours on the trails of Gwanak-san gave me but a taste of what the mountains of Seoul have to offer, and I can’t wait to continue exploring throughout the rest of my weekends.

Emily Goldberg | Daily Trojan. Photo from left to right: my dad, my mom, Rosario, me, Emilia Dimare (another USC student who I live with), and Julian.
My mom had been waiting to meet my host mom in Madrid ever since I got my housing assignment. Even when all I knew about my host family was that I would be living with a woman named Rosario Perez, my mom had already affectionately nicknamed her “Mamá Rosario.” (I’d later find out that Rosario has a husband named Julian, and a 9-year-old grandson who sometimes stays with us, named Ulysses.)
This past week, my mom finally got her chance to meet Mamá Rosario when she and my dad came to visit. I wasn’t very optimistic, however, about how the long-awaited meeting would turn out. The anxiety leading up to this felt similar what introducing in-laws will be like.
Rosario and her husband Julian are 75 and 83 years old respectively, and don’t speak a lick of English. Rosario can be a little particular, extremely blunt, stubborn and most of all – sassy. She is the sassiest 75-year-old I’ve ever met. My parents only know a few words and phrases in Spanish, and though my Spanish has gotten much better since I got here, I wouldn’t call myself fluent yet so I was a little nervous about having to translate through a meal. Yet regardless of the language barrier, both sides were eager to meet.
Rosario insisted that my parents come over for dinner. I told her not to make too much food (as she usually does) and she assured me that she would only make “aperitivos” or tapas appetizers. Of course the “aperitivos” were more than enough for a full meal: she prepared a salad, traditional “gambas al ajillo” (shrimp with garlic and olive oil), meatballs, ham and cheese, grilled peppers, olives and a Spanish tortilla.
After the two-hour “appetizer” my parents left the apartment and with a sigh of relief I knew it could not have possibly have went any better. My host parents were patient as I attempted to translate throughout the evening, the food was great and overall it turned out to be a really special occasion. I could tell Rosario took so much pride in her food, her home and how she’s been taking care of me for the last month and a half. She paraded around the tiny apartment making sure to show my mom every room, corner and closet, and constantly asked how the food was and if my parents needed anything else.
Even though my parents and host parents couldn’t communicate in the same language, they managed to get along really well. By the end of the night it felt like a real family dinner, and made me realize how lucky I am to have not only a loving and supportive American family but an equally great Spanish family too.

**SPOILER ALERT**
For those coping with severe withdrawal symptoms, Friday was a fabulous day for the House of Cards addict. After that brief tease a few weeks ago, Season Three is here to stay. When Season Two wrapped up with that breathtaking scene of Frank in the Oval Office, a lot of viewers were probably thinking, “Now that he’s President, where is the show going to go next?” And the answer is: politics.
Season One and Two essentially flirted with the politics of politics; how a Congressman uses every trick up his sleeve — bills, political allies, leverage in Congress — to manipulate his way to the presidency. With this new season, the drama is actually starting to explore political scenarios that run parallel to current issues in Washington D.C.
Though in reality, Vladimir Putin has never allegedly tried to kiss First Lady Michelle Obama, the underlying tension in Russian-American relations doesn’t just exist in the world of House of Cards. Moreover, the discussion about taking action in the Middle East and the tragic human cost of drone attacks are all very hot topics in the current political forum. By addressing these real issues, the political drama is not just making a statement about the complex social network that is Capitol Hill, but it’s also taking a critical stance on the way Washington D.C. handles these pertinent issues.
 
As always, however, we as viewers should be wary of distinguishing the show’s politics and real politics. In a television show, it is, after all, the narrative that foregrounds all else — not a balanced and accurate portrayal of our political capital.

Spring break…so close, yet so far. All you have to do is get through the last stretch of midterm season. Instead of stressing about all the tests you have next week, use one (or all) of the methods below to ace those midterms and feel confident going into spring break.
1. Get to Leavey earlier in the evening. With more tables open, in addition to the fact that you’ll be more awake, you’ll have more freedom and time to study. An added bonus: the feeling you get when you leave Leavey BEFORE midnight.

2. Make a study schedule that sets aside time every day to study. Not only will this help prevent you from procrastinating, but also in retaining information way more than cramming the night before the test. At least, that’s what Professor Lavond, who teaches a psychology class on learning and memory, says.

3. Study for 20 minutes at a time and ask yourself, “What did I just read?” before taking a break. This method takes advantage of our short attention span but also ensures better recall.

4. Think about what it’ll feel like when you’re done with all your midterms and on spring break. For me, this method is weirdly motivating. A potential future feeling of satisfaction and confidence motivates me to study harder.

5. Sleep! This goes in hand in hand with a spaced study schedule. By studying a little every day, you can get those wonderful eight to ten hours of sleep and can take your test feeling refreshed.

6. Make a study guide with friends in your classes, but ultimately study alone. Let’s be real: no studying actually gets done when you’re with your friends. Instead, use your friends to come up with a comprehensive study guide; this form of cooperation speeds up the studying process and makes studying alone more bearable.

7. Stay healthy! Make sure to eat three meals a day and avoid contact with people who are sick. Be super careful; the flu tends to go around during midterm season.

8. Lastly, don’t procrastinate! Arguably the most obvious method but also the most difficult one to follow through, being on top of everything seriously makes the difference. Use the above methods in combination to prevent procrastinating.
