As the Daily Trojan reported on Feb. 13, the Central American Network released a petition to change the name of El Centro Chicano to El Centro. With a growing population of Caribbean, Central and South American students, there have been many voices echoing the petition’s sentiment. 
Approximately 300 students signed the original petition put out by CAN.
CAN realized that although many students signed the petition, it was important to develop an inclusive and collaborative process for finding the right name for El Centro Chicano to ensure that the cultural center’s name represented a larger majority of the Latinx community at USC.
Since then, CAN, the Latinx Student Assembly, Latina/o Graduate Student Association and El Centro Chicano have formed a coalition to find a more inclusive name for the Latinx resource center. Each organization brings a different perspective to the group and continues to focus on elevating the voices of students. Given the demographic changes and political climate in the country, all four organizations agree that the time for change is here. 
A name change for El Centro Chicano would affect 14.1 percent of the student population at USC — almost 7,000 students. 
During the 1970s, when El Centro Chicano was created, the Latinx population in California and Texas was comprised primarily of Mexican Americans.
USC was located in a community that made up the largest Mexican population outside of Mexico. At that time, Movimiento Estudiantil Chicanx de Aztlán (MeChA) student leaders requested a student office space but were denied the request. These students were persistent and MeChA student leaders petitioned the USC administration for a student space in the Student Union Building which eventually led to the creation of the Chicano Taskforce at the University. 
After years of struggle and fighting, El Centro Chicano was established in 1972. The term “Chicano” was chosen to symbolize the struggle for political consciousness and inclusion.
Forty-six years later, the term Chicano continues to mean many different things to different people. At its foundation, Chicano was a term used to emphasize a collective consciousness, a collective race called la raza cosmica (the cosmic race). The Chicano movement sought to empower Mexican-Americans by creating an identity for themselves, as “Mexican” had become a derogatory label. After a large influx of Caribbean, Central and South American  people immigranted in the 1980s — many of them refugees of civil war and dictatorships — many Latinos in the United States that do not feel included when they see the term Chicano. 
The request for a name change for El Centro Chicano is not new to the cultural center; students have been asking for this change since at least 2005. As we face another era of political instability, it is imperative that we stay united as a community and be more inclusive than ever before.
The coalition has begun a research phase to ensure that El Centro Chicano can better fulfill its mission of inclusivity. Since February, we have hosted several events where we have brought each of our members to discuss how they feel about the current name. We hosted a Power Pan Dulce meeting where we invited Mary Ann Pacheco, an El Centro Chicano founder, to learn more about the center’s history. We also hosted a second Power Pan Dulce meeting with a panel of alumni and Carol Sigala, who helped found El Centro Chicano. They spoke about their experiences at El Centro Chicano and how they feel about the proposal to change the name of the cultural center. Each organization in the coalition has hosted other satellite events to keep the conversation going.
We sent out an anonymous survey through each of our organizations and to USC alumni, faculty and staff to learn more about how each individual perceives the term Chicano and how they identify themselves. The survey received 200 responses, 129 of which were from current students. 
In the survey, 86 percent of current USC students viewed the term “Latino/Latina/Latinx” as a broader, more inclusive way to describe our population. The survey also allowed for respondents to provide input on not only a new name but also what El Centro Chicano can do to have more inclusive practices. 
We are hosting a town hall on Tuesday from 5 to 7 p.m. next week in TCC 302 to hear the voices of the entire USC Latinx community — students, alumni, faculty, staff and community partners.

On Wednesday, the Daily Trojan released our Spring Supplement, “A Home Away From Home,” which outlines ongoing struggles with access to affordable, convenient and safe options for students and community members.
Elizabeth Gu | Daily Trojan
In our conversations with USC students, a number of them described their search for off-campus housing as a confusing process to navigate, and one that left the many students who are first-time renters vulnerable to exploitation from predatory leasing companies. USC students only have guaranteed access to accommodations through USC Housing for their freshman and sophomore years. After that, with USC housing options often filled by underclassmen, many juniors and seniors who have never rented before or are unfamiliar with housing in the area are left to search for a place to call home in the surrounding area with little support or resources from the University.
Students have reported issues with various management companies in the USC area for years. Most notably, in 2016, leasing company Stuho missed multiple completion deadlines of the Element apartment complex, leaving hundreds of students who had paid for and signed leases scrambling for accommodations during the school year. Our reporting found multiple landlords in the area who were engaged in questionable and unethical practices, such as evicting community members in an attempt to make room for USC students. 
A mix of limited affordable housing options and a lack of awareness about these options has led to USC’s substantial population of transfer students struggling to find housing by themselves with limited time, as well as many students opting to commute, and experiencing isolation from the USC community as a result. 
The University must accept responsibility for its students’ struggles to find reliable housing that fits their needs from ethical  landlords in the USC area. As a starting point, the University must play an active role in helping  situate students who do not acquire USC housing.
This can be accomplished through creating an updated, thorough registry that not only publicizes affordable housing in the area, but also gives students access to references about others’ experiences with landlords. In creating this registry, the University should ensure landlords and buildings known to partake in unethical or predatory practices are excluded from the registry.
Although USC offers an alternative housing resource webpage, it contains only links and information for weekly legal counseling aide on housing, and state-sponsored documents about tenants’ legal rights and protections. As a resource, this webpage is simply inadequate for the many students who have never signed a lease before or do not live near the South Los Angeles area — especially when they are about to sign year-long leases to management companies in USC’s backyard. 
USC is a powerhouse in the South L.A. community; it is one of Los Angeles’ biggest employers and a top-tier institution of higher learning. With that status, it has greater obligations and responsibilities within the community to ensure the safety and shelter of those in the “Trojan Family.” The University also has to disavow exploitative housing managers and landlords, who utilize students’ lack of knowledge to their advantage and disregard the rights of the South L.A.’s many low-income residents. 
The establishment of USC Village last fall was marketed as the ultimate solution to accessible housing for USC students. n addition to leaving many USC students still struggling, the Village also came at the cost of community members losing housing and storefronts. Intentionally or not, the University has already played a role in pushing vulnerable demographics from their homes and communities; now, it has an even greater obligation to take a stand against exploitative landlords and housing managers in the community, and guide students away from giving patronage to these entities. 
USC must create a registry that refers students seeking outside-housing only to trusted and ethical sources, publicizes affordable housing options and ensures that students are aware of other students’ experiences with certain management companies. And in addition to this, the University must provide more accessible counseling services to protect students from being taken advantage of. One approach could be to set up a physical office space where students can make appointments or walk in to discuss their specific needs with a counselor, or come to ask questions and seek legal advice if they feel a landlord has made a suspicious request.
USC policy guarantees housing for only first and second-year students. But shelter and living conditions are an integral aspect of students’ educational experiences, affecting their ability to focus on academics, practice self-care and participate in the surrounding community. The University has an obligation to ensure students are aware of affordable options and additionally steer them away from predatory or unreliable sources of housing. Otherwise, it must accept responsibility for enabling unethical practices in the community and the subsequent  exploitation of students.

Lily Vaughan | Daily Trojan
I hesitated before writing about DAMN., and its historic Pulitzer win. I’m no music expert, much less a critic, and I know even less about musical evaluation than the complex history of rap itself — a varied amalgam of musicology and cultural expression, neither of which I’m really qualified to evaluate. But there’s always been another dimension to the art, emerging out of the ’80s and ’90s and finding itself so purely expressed in the sizzling poetry of DAMN. — political visibility, and historical witness. These are my arenas. They’re also the reason DAMN. unequivocally deserved its Pulitzer win, and why the rest of us could only hope to be able to express our truths and our fears as succinctly, artfully and authentically as Compton’s Kendrick Duckworth, DAMN.’s “Kung-Fu Kenny,” America’s Kendrick Lamar. 
It would seem remiss of me to not begin with the musical legitimacy of the album, part of the reason it not only deserves its recent accolade but is also eligible at all to be considered, its salient messages aside. The Pulitzer music jury selected it by unanimous decision, calling its collection of 14 dynamic tracks “virtuosic” in nature. The choice to honor a popular, profitable idiom — one that is abrasively, outspokenly so — is a significant one, though not necessarily new. Music critics have previously lamented the jury’s failure to recognize jazz when it was avant-garde, to recognize minimalism in its heyday — perhaps it is a sign of necessary evolution that they are not making the same mistake with hip-hop, an art in its zenith. 
The board’s administrator Dana Cadey stated, “It shines a light on hip-hop in a completely different way. This is a big moment of hip-hop music, and a big moment for the Pulitzers.” This year’s selection is somewhat of a sociopolitical statement in and of itself. In other words, are the distinguished institutions beginning to legitimize rap? And does rap really need or care to receive this sort of affirmation? From this perspective, it seems the institutions are reaching to catch up with rap phenomenon, rather than the other way around. 
Shideh Ghandeharizadeh | Daily Trojan
More importantly, though, the album’s considerable musical chops pale in significance to its complex array of political and cultural messages. DAMN. is not just another example of the palpable self-awareness of rap, but of Kendrick’s considerable talent in building testaments to his own modern black experience in America, and those of his community. The album is a piece of historical witness; a snapshot of a culture whose ability to weave the personal and the general, sexual and devotional, the joyous and violent, cannot possibly be overlooked. Somehow in its poetry and interwoven nature, DAMN. surpasses the political messages of its contemporaries to challenge a white-dominant industry to publish, publicize and celebrate the experiences of forgotten populations.
In this manner, Lamar doesn’t just push musical boundaries — he certainly does innovate within a rapidly dynamic genre; but he also has created in this album a vibrant act of political journalism. He recognizes the backlash from white-dominant narratives against rap and its nature, an art largely expressive of certain pieces of black culture — “DNA.” is a particularly poignant track, and includes a sample from FOX News’ Geraldo Rivera accusing rap of “doing more damage to the African American community than racism” — and seems to offer a pithy, subversive answer: Fine. We will not discuss jewelry, women, parties — instead we will pull back the veil on the America left behind in a racialized power structure, the framework Rivera and others perpetuate. Thus, DAMN. is an audacious counter-offer: Let’s see if they enjoy that any better.
Common might be clever; Jay-Z is often palpably blunt (re: “The Story of OJ”). But Kendrick’s political expression is poetic — and truly, artfully personal and general, balancing both the testament of his own life and times as well as the injustices still pervasive in what he synthesizes as a general black experience. “FEEL.,” “DNA.” and especially “DUCKWORTH.,” were painful self-examinations, finding a personal narrative within a system and an experience so naturally political, and so often politicized — often by opponents to movements of justice or advancement. By contrast, tracks like “HUMBLE.” and “BLOOD.” explore a dramatic, often philosophical, occasionally Biblical struggle to satisfy both morality and survival. These are a collection of pieces that artistically explore the effects of actions of others, the silence and negligence of stakeholders in an unequal society — those who are, often, his listeners. Lamar stands out especially because his witness is nuanced; there is a conflict and a divide within himself, expressed equally as raw as the divide he observes in American society. As journalist Julia Craven so adeptly noted, “‘DAMN.’ is a comprehensive explanation of the black struggle today that deserves its spot in the history books … Lamar is documenting the reality we live in. ‘DAMN.’ is really an oral history.” 
To bear witness is a political act, as necessary as campaigning, voting and volunteering; to act politically through art is a part of our civil discourse, and an integral part of the manner in which American democracy has always operated. Recognition of Lamar’s work exists dually as recognition of his struggle; it is hard to imagine that the young artist of “Swimming Pools,” could have ever been mentioned in the same breath as Zora Neale Hurston or Maya Angelou, but his poetry also counts. Gritty and street-wise, biting and unafraid, Lamar made the direction of his bars clear to all as early as his Grammy performance in 2016 — standing in handcuffs in front of a white silhouette of the African continent, labeled “Compton.” He performed before millions of American — and white — eyes.
The power of the human narrative expressed within oppressive institutions is not always written in the thinkpieces of national newspapers or the chapters of nonfiction novels or testified in letters read aloud to Congress — sometimes it hides in plain sight, in mainstream commercialized products. But Lamar is not hiding; in his case, this power shines.

“Film can change people’s lives,” said Eleanor Cho, who started the club Spotlight On Hope at USC because of her conviction in the power of film. Through various workshops, the club teaches cancer pediatric patients and their families how to create stop motion animation.
Maansi Manchanda | Daily Trojan
On Thursday, Cho and the club screened 10 films, which were all produced by workshops from the organization. They were screened on Thursday at the School of Cinematic Arts. The filmmakers watched their own movies on the big screen and participated in a Q & A session afterward.
Spotlight On Hope Film Camp was originally founded at UC Riverside. Cho, a senior majoring in film and television production, brought the organization with her when she transferred from UC Riverside to USC.
“I remembered how Spotlight on Hope provides free film workshops for pediatric cancer patients and their siblings,” Cho said. “I really wanted to bring that to USC.”
Spotlight on Hope launched its first workshop at UCLA back in 2013 when the organization’s original founder Cassie Nguyen, a pediatric brain cancer survivor, brought the idea to Think Ten Media group, an organization that aims to create media projects that inspire change.
Nguyen said she initially started the organization because she knew how important it was for cancer pediatric patients to have opportunities to be social with family and friends. 
“I was diagnosed with cancer when I was 16,” Nguyen said. “Having friends, going shopping and going to the movies are so important to you as a teenager. When I was just in the hospital, I couldn’t be around my friends because I was fighting for my life.”
When Nguyen recovered, she said she was motivated by her experience to start Spotlight On Hope. At first, the program focused on giving pediatric cancer patients a place to socialize. But as she continued conducting workshops, she realized the workshops improved participants’ mental wellness as well. 
“Spotlight On Hope gives kids the opportunity to explore their imaginations,” Nguyen said. “The program offered me a way to escape into the make-believe world.” 
Currently Spotlight On Hope at USC is trying to expand so that it can host workshops in hospitals, Cho said. The organization wants to help all children with chronic illnesses, not just those with cancer diagnoses. 
“I think art in general can change people’s lives for the better,” Cho said. “Just the process of imagining something and bringing it into reality is transformative. Knowing that you have the ability to bring things to life is really amazing.”

With social justice movements such as #MeToo going viral on social media and U.S. Senators working to advance legislation to combat sexual harassment, some professors at USC decided to take the matters into their own hands.
Terence Fitzgerald and Erik Schott, professors at the Dworak-Peck School of Social Work, have spread the movement through emails to student, staff and faculty at the school with tips and statistics. Image courtesy of Terence Fitzgerald.
In 2017, USC Dworak-Peck School of Social Work clinical associate professors Terence Fitzgerald and Erik Schott co-founded the “It Ends” movement to educate male audiences about how to combat sexual harassment and violence. 
To spread the message of the movement, Schott said weekly emails are sent to students, staff and faculty in Dworak-Peck with statistics and tips that people can use to help combat sexual harassment and violence on campus. Some of the tips provide ways to intervene in situations, such as alerting the nearest authorities like residential assistants. Fitzgerald said tips like these can play a significant role in eliminating this issue. 
“If we want to end homophobia, we need to get the heterosexual community involved,” Schott said. “If we want to end racism, we need to get those who hold the dominant power, which in our country are Caucasian people, involved. We need to get the men involved with the issue on how to stop sexual assault against women. This movement won’t change unless those who hold the power also change it as well.”
According to Fitzgerald, all men have a role in advancing the cause of justice for survivors of assault and should be educated on this issue. Both Fitzgerald and Schott said they want to foster an environment at USC that is positive for men and women. 
“We want to create something lasting, not something that is like a once-a-year type of thing,” Fitzgerald said. “We want to make sure that we are present throughout the years. We want to improve our campus climate so that it is free of sexual harassment, so that’s free of violence and assault.”
Currently, the movement has only reached out to Dworak-Peck students and faculty members because the co-founders wanted to start off small. Next semester, Schott said he hopes to expand the movement to other colleges, such as the Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism, the School of Cinematic Arts and Marshall School of Business. 
Once the whole campus is involved, Fitzgerald said he wants the movement to spread to other universities across the nation. 
“I wanted to get involved with this mission because I am a huge believer in the power of advocacy,” Dworak-Peck graduate student Gabriel Reyes said. “I believe in how much strength that these types of events and movements bring to different students and supporters.” 
The movement’s largest event of the year, a Round Table Dialogue with Leaders in the Movement, will be hosted on Tuesday in Vivian Hall. 
According to Schott, the conference is meant to encourage men to pitch ideas, learn how to speak up for victims and survivors and eventually put an end to this issue. 
“I hope that the men who join this movement learn to understand this epidemic and hopefully know what steps they can take to do one small thing to help change this,” Schott said. “We want to give some tools to not only to start a dialogue, but to also intervene the next time they see someone being harassed. Giving these individuals the tools and the empowerment to speak up will make a difference.”

As a senior in high school in Arizona, Pooja Dhupati recalls learning about the influx of children from Central America enrolling in United States public schools.
Senior Pooja Dhupati and sophomore Molly Solem visited Belmont High School for Campus Beautification Day. Photo courtesy of Pooja Dhupati.
“The schools were figuring out what to do with them,” said Dhupati, a senior majoring in sociology and public health. “Also, Arizona is a very conservative state, so it didn’t always have the kindest narrative about that.”
According to the Los Angeles Times, the nation has experienced waves of more than 100,000 immigrants from Central America in the past five years. Most of these refugees are unaccompanied minors who encounter language, cultural and financial barriers. 
Dhupati is the president of the Community Health Connection, an organization founded at USC two years ago. The organization connects marginalized communities with partners who provide food and health services, or overall aid for them to better adapt to environments that can seem foreign or even hostile.
According to Dhupati, the organization hosts health fairs at local schools that connect families with various advocacy nonprofits, legal aid groups, immigrant rights coalitions and community clinics. Some of these organizations include Planned Parenthood, California Immigrant Youth Justice Alliance and Dignity Health California Hospital Medical Center.
These organizations and clinics have extensive experience serving vulnerable populations in Los Angeles, and many immigrant families and minors encounter barriers accessing these resources, Dhupati said.
“There are so many reasons these communities and mixed-status families are scared to go to the doctor and I thought, ‘What if this kid got a cold or something? His schedule is already so tight,’” Dhupati said. “Health is the foundation [to] all of this. To be able to focus on your education, you should first need to have health for any of this to happen.”
According to Dhupati, the Community Health Connection is currently partnered with six high schools throughout the Los Angeles area. 
Dhupati said Belmont High School is one of the more active institutions that have gained a reputation for welcoming immigrant enrollment. According to the Los Angeles Times, one in four students from Belmont High School are Central American minors who  escaped from social and political upheavals in Central America. This surge of young refugees has forced educational institutions within the Los Angeles community to reimagine the role of schools and administrations in students’ lives, Belmont principal Elsa Mendoza said. 
“Historically, Belmont High School, being in the middle of downtown Los Angeles, has seen many of these families and children come to settle in this area and enroll in our school,” she said. “[We] provide them English language classes so that they are learning the language. They are getting additional support in their core content classes, along with coaching from the teachers.” 
According to Mendoza, many immigrant students have to maintain a delicate balance of working long hours and meeting academic requirements. On top of work and school responsibilities, they also battle the emotional strain.

USC Leonard Davis School of Gerontology professor Valter Longo’s research into how fasting and diets can protect against aging and diseases was awarded a $10 million grant from the National Institute on Aging. The grant is to be given out in $2 million installments over the next five years, a USC news release said. 
Longo is the primary investigator in a project involving researchers from USC and Harvard University. While Longo’s research focuses on how food can affect aging, the program grant applies to a variety of interventions to prevent aging through the regeneration of cells, systems and organs. 
Longo, who is the director of the USC Longevity Institute, designed a low-calorie diet that mimics the effects of fasting. Part of the grant funding will examine how his diet affects cellular regeneration and aging. 
“We propose to improve these fasting-mimicking regimens, test their effect on mouse health span and test the hypothesis that they promote both cellular protection and stem cell-based regeneration in multiple systems,” Longo told USC News.
Three other researchers at USC and Harvard are receiving part of the grant to fund their projects, including one that looks into how humanin, an amino acid compound known as a peptide derived from the mitochondria, could protect against age-related diseases like Alzheimer’s and cancer. That project will be led by Davis School of Gerontology Dean Pinchas Cohen.
Another project, led by Harvard professor James Mitchell, will investigate how hydrogen sulfide affects cellular stress resistance and longevity, which could have implications for stem cell regeneration. 
USC gerontology research professor Todd Morgan will oversee experimental protocols for the entire program, ensuring that mice and other animals used in the projects are standardized among collaborators. 
“These studies will contribute to the identification of drugs and interventions to treat and prevent multiple diseases by acting on the aging process and on multi-system regeneration and rejuvenation,” Longo told USC News.

Visitors of this year’s Los Angeles Times Festival of Books will witness a new exhibition, designed to push the definition of storytelling into a new dimension. Newstory will make use of creative storytelling to bring improvisation, immersive entertainment and more to the festival, showcasing a plethora of exhibits you’ll have to see to fully understand.
Photo from Facebook.
Clint Schaff, the vice president of strategy and development for the  Los Angeles Times, was in charge of the Newstory programming this year, and said he was primarily drawn to artists and public figures who were making use of as many resources as possible to share their messages.
“I was first looking for storytellers who do their craft across more than one medium,” he said. “I was really interested in that conversation of not just how they do that one thing well, but how they choose to express themselves in one medium versus another, at any given time in their life or career.”
While curating the lineup, Schaff saw almost no limits to what could be considered storytelling, driving him to find unlikely combinations that would mesh well with the rest of what Newstory had to offer. Referencing record producer Moby, who will be featured in conversation with author Bob Lefsetz on Saturday, Schaff noted how the artist’s restaurant in Silver Lake, which donates 100 percent of its proceeds to animal rights organizations, was a form of storytelling that he’s excited for visitors to learn more about.
“I’ve been listening to Moby’s music since the early ’90s, and I actually don’t catch a message of animal rights in the music itself,” he said. “That’s him telling a story through food, culinary storytelling.”
Moby won’t be the only musician sharing his story at the festival this year; KRS-One, Ali Shaheed Muhammad of A Tribe Called Quest and many others will also be present at Newstory to interact with the audience. Schaff is particularly excited about an exhibition that will be put on by 1500 or Nothin members Larrance Dopson and James Fauntleroy II, acclaimed producers who have worked with artists such as Sam Smith, Beyoncé and Rihanna. As part of the Spotify Secret Genius series, they will produce a brand new song right in front of the audience, taking suggestions from the crowd to directly involve them in the creative process.
Schaff hopes visitors will leave such exhibits not only entertained by what transpired on stage, but inspired to follow their own passions and share their own creations with the world as well.
“A lot of festivals have the effect of having the audience think, ‘Wow, those people on stage do something that I could never do,’” he said. “The tools of storytelling have democratized so much over the last couple decades, but I think the fear of not doing it well enough remains for many.”
For many years, the Festival of Books has involved elements of storytelling beyond the boundaries of the page, but Schaff sees Newstory as the next step for the festival to keep pace with the ever-changing creative landscape. Although books and traditional writing remain at the center of the festival, Newstory will allow visitors to broaden their experience while they’re on campus over the weekend, and imagine what legendary authors of prior generations would have been able to accomplish with the technology of today.
“If John Steinbeck, Mark Twain or George Orwell were doing their thing today and had a story to tell, I’m not certain they’d do it through a book, I think they might do it on a YouTube channel,” Schaff said. “They might do it on a Snapchat [Discover] platform. Or maybe more to the point, I think they would probably do it on both. That’s the privilege of the time that we’re living in right now; we have access to these tools, and we wanted to celebrate that, especially given that those industries are so important to L.A.”

The Los Angeles Times Festival of Books is, obviously, focused on books. But it’s also an exploration of Los Angeles’ culture through literary media and beyond — and this includes the art of food. In addition to the book talks and signings, there will be panels on food, cookbooks and culinary culture.

The festival features five different food-related events Saturday spread throughout the day. Four of them will all be in the same location: the Pacific Sales Cooking Stage, located between Waite Phillips Hall and Leavey Library. Natalie Morales, the West Coast anchor for the Today show as well as a journalist for NBC News, will kick off the food panels by talking about her cookbook At Home with Natalie. At 12:30 p.m., professional boxer Laila Ali, the daughter of Muhammed Ali, will talk about her book Food for Life.
The first food panel will take place at Seeley G. Mudd at 2:30 p.m. The panel, titled “Food: The New Culture,” will require a ticket, which can be purchased online for $2 before the event. Moderated by L.A. Times columnist Gustavo Arellano, the former publisher and editor of the OC Weekly, this panel consists of National Geographic writer and former Newsweek correspondent Dan Stone, and chefs and authors Andrew Friedman and Edward Lee.
At the same time at the Pacific Sales Cooking Stage, celebrity chef and restaurateur Jet Tila will talk about his 2017 book 101 Asian Dishes You Need to Cook Before You Die, an accumulation of his many years as a chef that also harkens back to his roots growing up in a Chinese and Thai household in Los Angeles.
Saturday’s final food event is a talk by Alison Clare Steingold, author of The L.A. Cookbook, a collection of recipes from some of the best eateries in Los Angeles. Steingold will be accompanied by master baker pastry chef Roxana Jullapat.
Sunday features five food events as well: four book talks and one panel. 
The first talk is at 11 a.m., and features media personality and chef Devin Alexander, New York Times bestselling author of the Biggest Loser cookbooks, and most recently, author of a diabetes-conscious cookbook You Can Have It. 
Wallis Annenberg Hall will host the food discussion panel on Sunday at noon. The panel is titled “The Evolution of Mexican Food in Los Angeles” and is moderated by USC professor and author Sarah Portnoy. Eater L.A. contributor Bill Esparza and Guerrilla Tacos creator Wes Avila will engage in discussion about tacos, Los Angeles culture and everything in between. 
At 12:30 p.m., the Smollett family will talk about their book The Family Table on the Pacific Sales Cooking Stage. This will be followed at 2 p.m. by Valerie Bertinelli discussing her book Valerie’s Home Cooking. Sunday’s food talks will wrap up at 3:30 p.m. with the second appearance of Avila. He will discuss his book Guerrilla Tacos: Recipes from the Streets of L.A.
Beyond these 10 food events, there will be plenty of food trucks and stands around campus as well for festivalgoers to taste L.A.’s food as well as learn about the people that make, write about and discuss L.A.’s food culture. The Los Angeles Festival of Books runs from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. on Saturday and 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. on Sunday.

Photo of Celeste from Facebook.
The annual Los Angeles Times Festival of Books will take place on campus from April 21 to 22. In addition to a slew of authors and literary events, the festival will also host a variety of musical performances over the course of the weekend. These artists hail from across  the Los Angeles area, but many of them are affiliated with USC, either as current or past students and professors. This list provides a rundown of the USC-affiliated acts, all of which will take place on the USC stage, located in Hanh  Plaza. 
Saturday: 
Celeste Butler – 2 p.m.
Celeste Butler is a senior majoring in popular music. She is a seasoned musician, already having performed at the STAPLES Center, the Moonlight Amphitheatre and the Copley Symphony Hall. Her music reflects her gospel roots and is influenced by modern R&B, EDM and pop. Butler will perform songs that embody love, culture and community.
Kinglii – 4:20 p.m.
Kinglii consists of a trio of USC students: vocalist/guitarist Mark Adam, bassist Eddie Stone and drummer Jarren Heidelberg. Like Butler, all three are currently seniors majoring in popular music. They started working together to support Adam as a songwriter and became a unit over time. From the start, they have never been afraid to create unconventional forms of music.
“We’ve experimented with utilizing everything in and outside of the usual rock band idiom: from guitars, keyboards, to kazoos and various percussion elements,” Stone said. 
Now they wear t-shirts are emblazoned with the slogan, “genre is dead” and the band reflects this motto with its blended R&B, folk and pop melodies. The band has been performing live for the past two years, including such venues as Tommy’s Place and the Trojan TV Soundstage. They will be performing songs from their debut EP, “Fellas,” which was released this past October, as well their funk-dance song “Body Language.” 
“We hope that the audience will leave feeling better connected with themselves, and/or with a loved one because of the stories we tell and our contagious energy,” Adam said. 
LAMI – 5:30 p.m.
LAMI is the stage name for Lami Friebe, a sophomore majoring in  popular music. He is a rapper, singer, drummer and pianist who comes from a family of musicians. His musical style has been influenced by hip-hop artists such as Kendrick Lamar and J. Cole, and jazz artists will perform five of his pieces from current projects, as well as music from unreleased and upcoming projects. 
“I want the audience to leave having felt like they went on a musical journey through different styles and be able to have a stronger appreciation for hip hop, as well as appreciating the hard work and musicianship on stage … and to just have a fun time listening and dancing to my music,” Friebe said. 
Sunday: 
The USC Marching Band will kick off the day’s performances at 10 a.m., paving the way for the following acts. 
The Kinetic Winds – 11:40 a.m.
The Kinetic Winds, founded in August 2017, is a quintet comprising five USC Thornton School of Music graduate students. The group is led by bassoonist Amber Wyma, clarinetist Sergio Coelho, oboist Chris Fujiwara, horn player Sean Holmes and flutist Emma McCartney. They have performed a variety of different pieces, even rearranging ones intended for full orchestras.
The Blue Agave – 2 p.m.
The Blue Agave is a Latin musical performance project created by Andy Abad and Stephanie Amaro, a husband-wife duo. Abad is currently a professor of popular music at USC and Amaro is a Grammy-nominated artist who has been heavily involved in the L.A. mariachi scene. The couple delivers traditional bolero and flamenco music infused with rock and dark surf elements. 
ALAJE – 4:30 p.m.
ALAJE, or the Afro-Latin American Jazz Ensemble, will take the stage for the final performance of the festival. Its musical style is rooted in Afro-Cuban influences, especially rhythms from Brazil and Cuba combined with jazz sensibility. The band frequently features special guests and pieces arranged by students, making this “little big band” a favorite in the Thornton community. Sixteen ALAJE  band members, including graduate and undergraduate students, will perform on Sunday, led by faculty director Aaron Serfaty.

Karan Nevatia | Daily Trojan
My introduction to the world of podcasts was quite fitting — one of the first articles I was assigned to write for my high school newspaper was about a class where students were making podcasts rather than writing an essay for one of their units. 
I talked to a few people at my school who were already enthusiastic podcast listeners and found their passion inspiring. They introduced me to Serial, which, despite having already broken out of the niche world that podcasts still mostly inhabit and entered the mainstream, I hadn’t yet heard of. 
They told me about Welcome to Night Vale, a fictional radio show reporting on the town of Night Vale, where, according to the podcast’s creator Joseph Fink, all conspiracy theories are true. The podcast is a supernatural dark comedy, a feat of modern magical realism that’s created a cult following of tens of thousands of listeners. 
So it was only natural for me to download the first episodes of each story. And immediately, I was enraptured. Both podcasts were so different — Serial was a serious, investigative story that developed throughout each episode, and Night Vale was a creative work of worldbuilding and humor. 
But both had something no other form of storytelling could provide. They created soundscapes in my headphones that thoroughly engaged me in the worlds they existed in; I felt like I wasn’t just hearing a story, I was existing in a space where that story was occurring around me. 
My podcast consumption snowballed from there. I subscribed to nearly every NPR podcast I could find, from Shankar Vedantam’s Hidden Brain, which delves into how psychology applies to our everyday decisions, to Radio Ambulante, NPR’s first-ever Spanish language podcast. Despite having only learned the minimum amount  of Spanish to pass my high school language requirement, the use of sound in Radio Ambulante made the stories as understandable as any other. 
During my senior year, I decided that I wanted to make my own podcast. I tried to start one at my school newspaper, but between the extracurriculars I was involved in, college applications and challenging classes, I never found the time to do so. 
Instead, I started writing reviews of podcasts for my school newspaper — what started out as full-length articles for my school newspaper would soon turn into my podcast review website, where I wrote reviews of 100 different podcasts in 100-word blurbs. Although it took me nearly a full year, I completed it toward the end of my first semester at USC, and I was proud to have something to show for my obsession with podcasts, even if it wasn’t a podcast of my own. 
It was this semester at USC that I made the transition — from podcast connoisseur to podcaster. I still continue to talk and write about podcasts all the time (this column is a good example), but I finally found myself behind the mic this semester. 
I am enrolled in a class called “Aural Culture.” In the course, we consider everything about how sound functions in society — from the physics of how sound works in the first place to how music and sound art serve as integral parts of our communities and entertainment. Podcasts, naturally, were a major part of the class. 
For my final project, I made a podcast on my own. Although my only experience with the Adobe Audition audio editing software was in an introductory journalism class where we spent a week or two creating audio stories, I was able to put together a fun story with a voiceover, some natural sound and some musical undertones, the elements of podcasts that made me love them in the first place. 
And of course, the Daily Trojan gave me the opportunity I had been working toward since my senior year of high school — creating and hosting my own podcast. I pitched a news discussion show to our editor-in-chief Emma Peplow, and after much deliberation, we decided to name it “General Education.” 
Each week, two guests and I discuss our favorite stories from the pages of the Daily Trojan. Although it took forever to make sure everything went right when we first started the podcast, now, recording the podcast is easy, and each episode seems to be better than the last. 
And then — one week ago — I I was offered an internship with Pineapple Street Media, a podcast production company that produced some of my favorite audio stories. With this internship, my role in the world of podcasts is no longer just as an obsessive fan or an amateur podcaster — I’m now a part of the magic.
Pineapple Media has shared stories like Missing Richard Simmons, a longform podcast that investigated why the actor and fitness instructor decided to disappear from public life, and With Her, the podcast where Pineapple Street Media co-founder Max Linksy interviewed then-presidential candidate Hillary Clinton. 
Needless to say, I am elated to begin working there. 
So, to close out my final “Honest to Pod” column of the semester, I want to thank everyone who made the development of my relationship to podcasts possible. To the assigning editor at my high school who inadvertently sparked my love for podcasts. To the people I interviewed who told me about their favorite podcasts. 
To my best friend Meghan, who was the person who held me accountable to finishing my podcast review website on the days I felt like giving up. To my aural culture professor Bruce Smith and teaching assistant Dexter Booth, who taught me so much about sound that I otherwise would’ve never considered.
To lifestyle editors Kitty Guo and Kenan Draughorne, who let me have this column at the last minute even though applications were well past due. To Jonathon Xue, our multimedia editor, who has to put up with listening to the sound of my voice over and over again when he edits and produces General Education every week, transforming it from a raw cut of stuttered and mispronounced sentences to a clean and professional audio story. 
To Emma Peplow, our editor-in-chief, who encouraged and supported starting General Education despite my lack of podcasting experience and who puts up with me constantly pronouncing her last name completely wrong at the end of every episode. To associate managing editor Kylie Cheung, who found and sent me Pineapple Street Media’s internship application, and who encouraged me to apply when initially I doubted my qualifications for it.
And finally, to Maddy Sprung-Keyser, Jess Hackel, Jenna Weiss-Berman and Max Linsky, all of whom work at Pineapple Street Media, who saw something in me and my love for podcasts and decided I was worthy of the opportunity to make podcasts with them. 
Karan Nevatia is a freshman majoring in journalism. He is also the news editor of the Daily Trojan. His column, “Honest to Pod,” ran every other Friday.

The USC men’s volleyball team lost to No. 4 BYU in Provo on Thursday night in its Mountain Pacific Sports Federation playoff game.
Sunny Dong | Daily Trojan
Coming off a remarkable upset against No. 3-seeded Pepperdine, the No. 6 Trojans hoped to use their momentum to take on the overall top-seeded Cougars, who earned a quarterfinal bye last weekend. 
Before the game, head coach Jeff Nygaard spoke about the different dynamics of postseason play. 
“Regardless of what happens in the regular season, once you get to the playoffs, everybody’s at the same level, at the same footing,” Nygaard said. 
BYU did not take USC lightly and reminded everyone why they are the favorite to take home the championship. With a 21-6 record on the season (10-2 in conference), BYU had already defeated the Men of Troy twice this season, both times 3-1. 
In addition, the Cougars demonstrated an ability to close out games against fellow ranked foes, such as Grand Canyon University, Lewis University, UC Santa Barbara and Ohio State, all of whom defeated USC. Conversely, USC’s predominantly underclassmen squad consistently showed great flashes of potential by hanging tight with teams for half or most the game before being unable to close sets in the final points. That proved to be the case once again against the Cougars; USC was tied 12-12 in both the first and second set, and even led 21-20 in the third set, before eventually losing all three by margins of 25-17, 25-17 and 25-22. 
For the Trojans, star redshirt junior outside hitter Jack Wyett went out in his final game with a relatively average 10 kills. His fellow junior outside hitters Gianluca Grasso and Ryan Moss were also held below their usual production; Grasso finished with nine kills, three aces and two blocks, while Moss had seven kills and two blocks. Freshman middle blocker Sam Lewis, who is expected to be one of the bona fide leaders next season, finished with four kills and two blocks. 
BYU won with a collective effort throughout the night. Senior outside hitter Brenden Sander had 12 kills, while freshman opposite hitter Gabi Garcia Fernandez had 12 kills. Sophomore outside Cyrus Fa’alogo also chipped in 12 kills. As a team, USC was significantly outhit .529 to .205, out-digged 24 to 13 and out-aced six to three. 
Overall, it was a bittersweet season for the Trojans to say the least. After starting the year off in the top 15, the Trojans stayed in it for the first half of the season, but failed to collect a win against another ranked team. 
With only four departing players and many young players, the Trojans seemed to find joy in trusting the process and believing the results would come with time. 
At times, they were able to see the payoff at times, most notably their big-time Senior Night win versus crosstown rival UCLA, as well as their quarterfinal upset against Pepperdine. 
Though their season is over, the team redefined its idea of success relative to what they had going for them, and in doing so, set the stage for even greater things in the coming years. 
While USC will look largely the same on paper next year, fans can expect a completely different product on the court with a year of experience together under their belts and fresh motivation to prove the next phase in their collective growth.

It’s rivalry weekend in Southern California as the 18-15 USC Trojans face off against the 13th ranked 22-10 UCLA Bruins across town at Jackie Robinson Stadium. 
The last time the two teams faced off was at the Dodger Stadium College Baseball Classic on March 11. The game ended dramatically, as USC junior left fielder Lars Nootbaar hit a go-ahead home run late in the eighth inning to bring the game to a 3-2 win for the Trojans.
THE SEASON SO FAR
Ling Luo | Daily Trojan
SC The team hopes to come ahead again this time around, since they have not done very well against ranked teams — they hold a 2-5 record against teams that are ranked. They lost all their games against the Stanford Cardinal and only earned one other win against Arkansas.
Despite holding an above .500 record in overall play, the Trojans possess a 6-9 record in conference play, ranking seventh in the Pac-12 standings. The Trojans have yet to win a Pac-12 series against a higher ranked team, having lost to Stanford, Washington and Arizona.
After starting the season on the right foot with a 7-1 record, the Trojans have fallen short, going 11-14 over their last 25 gamesand look far from the team they were at the start of the season. Both the defense and the offense have not played well thus far — or at least not up to the standards of a typical USC baseball team.
“Well, we got to try and win as many games as possible from here on out,” head coach Dan Hubbs said after the loss to UC Santa Barbara on Tuesday. “I still believe that this team is capable of going on a run, but we have to play well. We have to pitch well and we have to play well.”
On paper, the UCLA Bruins are the favorites going into the weekend. The Bruins rank eighth in the country in ERA with 2.85, while the Trojans have a lackluster 4.76 ERA in comparison. The Bruins also have a better batting average, .277 compared to the Trojans .248, and a better on base percentage; .397 over USC’s .332.
PLAYERS TO LOOK OUT FOR
There are a few players to watch in the series this weekend. For the Bruins, sophomore outfielder Jeremy Ydens leads the team in batting average with an average of .378 in 98 at-bats this season. Along with Ydens, sophomore infielder Chase Strumpf has proved himself as the team’s primary slugger, as he has already crushed 8 home runs. He also holds a .333 batting average this year.
On the USC team, freshman shortstop Ben Ramirez is a player to watch. After suffering a broken wrist earlier in the season and being out for about a month, he has come back into the Trojans’ lineup and immediately made an impact both offensively and defensively. He has batted .319 average this season, the best batting average for the Trojans. 
Junior first baseman Dillon Paulson is another player to watch for on the Trojan team. After hitting 2 home runs in the 6-1 win against the LMU Lions, Paulson now leads the team with six home runs on the year. Nootbaar follows closely behind with 4 home runs.
EXPECTED STARTING PITCHERS
Most likely pitching for the Bruins is senior pitcher Jake Bird who in nine starts has an impressive 1.65 ERA, while allowing only 11 runs all season. He has posted 36 strikeouts on the season. Despite his rather impressive numbers, he is not unbeatable. He holds a 4-2 record entering this series. 
Freshman pitcher Zach Pettway has been equally impressive this season and is also a viable option to start at the mound for UCLA. He holds a 5-1 record with a 2.85 ERA while leading the team in strikeouts with 43. He’s been impressive at defining the strike zone, walking only nine batters this year. 
For the Trojans, freshman pitcher Kyle Hurt will most likely hit the mound this weekend. He has been inconsistent all season, but flashed pure brilliance earlier in the year year when he threw a no-hitter against Utah. And while he has struck out 42 batters so far this year, he hasn’t shined all season. He holds a 2-3 record on the year with an 4.20 ERA. 
Both teams hope to improve their respective records and standing within conference play. The games will take place at Jackie Robinson Stadium Friday night at 7 p.m., Saturday at 4 p.m. and Sunday at noon.

After snapping their three-game losing streak in a win over the San Diego State Aztecs, the Women of Troy, now ranked third in the Pac-12, are headed to Tempe, Ariz. to take on the Arizona State Sun Devils. The match will be the last of USC’s conference and regular season schedule.

The Pac-12 conference game against the Sun Devils carries substantial weight. The Trojans currently sit at 5-4 within the Pac-12. With a loss to the Sun Devils and a win by the Oregon Ducks over the first-ranked Colorado Buffaloes, the Women of Troy would sit at a tie with the Ducks at 5-5 within the division. The Trojans are 1-1 against the Ducks thus far in 2018.
Earlier this season, the Trojans overpowered the Sun Devils 14-3 at McAlister Field. Despite heavy showers, the Women of Troy’s first ever conference game within the Pac-12 ended up being their first-ever win as members of the conference.
The Sun Devils currently stand at 6-10 for the season and are ranked No. 6 in the Pac-12. Their season has fluctuated repeatedly; despite their record, they do have a few impressive wins under their belt for the season.
The Trojans have been preparing for Arizona State all week after last week’s triumph over San Diego State in their final home game of the season.
The 17-7 win improved USC to 7-0 all-time against the Aztecs and 35-10 all-time at McAlister Field. The win was also the Trojans’ first win over SDSU since USC left the MPSF conference.
“This win against the Aztecs was an awesome way to end the home schedule and sums up the last four years with the team,” USC senior goalie Gussie Johns said after logging her 12th career game with double-digit saves, and her fifth of the season (11 saves). 
“This win was really special and a great experience,” Johns said. 
Leading up to the match this week, the Women of Troy practiced hard and fixed errors from the previous matches with hopes of a win over SDSU. Their hard work and effort reflected on the field when it came to game time, winning the match with a 10-point lead. 
 Sophomore midfielder Kerrigan Miller caused two turnovers for her 68th-career CT, and in the process moved into third in the program’s history. Miller was pleased with the win against the Aztecs.
“Feels great that we got this win for the seniors and it’s a great feeling to win our last home game,” Miller said. 
The Women of Troy have been a successful group throughout the season, but they still need strong performances from their graduating seniors — each of whom played a vital role in their big win over San Diego State on Senior Day.
All-American senior defender Lydia Sutton scored her first goal of the season last week to go along with an assist. However, her impact was felt the most on defense, where she recorded five ground balls and caused four turnovers against the Aztecs.
 The team should also expect big performances from its leading scorers: Miller, who is coming off a 2-goal and two-assist performance and sophomore attacker Izzy McMahon who scored 4 goals to go along with one assist against the Aztecs.
 A win this weekend would make the Trojans a lock to hold the third seed in the conference. With their conference standing on the line, the Women of Troy look to dominate this weekend to secure their spot as the third-ranked team heading into the Pac-12 Tournament.

Ollie Jung | Daily Trojan
At this point next week, Sam Darnold will represent the future of an NFL franchise.
We’ve waited a while: The former Trojan quarterback’s professional future has been the talk of the entire football universe ever since his 27-yard bomb nestled into Deontay Burnett’s arms against Penn State in January 2017. After over a year of constant scrutiny and wild swings of opinion, the time for speculation is almost over.
Darnold will almost certainly be selected within the first five picks of the NFL Draft next Thursday. And upon inking his approximately $30 million contract, he will shoulder the burden of ending years, possibly generations, of misery for his new team’s fanbase.
With the top four selections split between two cities, Darnold will likely find himself in either Cleveland or New York (barring a surprising trade). Each presents a massive challenge — pressure that has crushed the greatest of college quarterbacks — and if he is the top overall pick, as many expect him to be, that pressure will be all the heavier.
Can the 20-year-old survive in Cleveland, where he could become the youngest starting signal caller in the NFL? The Browns have been where quarterbacks go to die since the franchise rebooted in 1999: The franchise’s four first-round quarterbacks in the last two decades have combined for 114 touchdown passes — 53 fewer than the total Andy Dalton has compiled across seven not-so-remarkable professional seasons.
Then again, would he be better off with the Jets, which might be the only franchise that can rival Cleveland’s level of dysfunction? The Browns may have the league’s worst reputation as quarterback developers, but Gang Green can give them a run for their money. New York drafted at the position in four consecutive years (2013-2016) and have so far gotten a total of 37 starts from those selections — the vast majority of which came from Geno Smith, who threw 25 touchdowns and 34 interceptions before fracturing his jaw in a locker room brawl and losing the starting job in 2015.
Things don’t look quite as bleak across town, but joining the New York Giants comes with its own significant hurdles. Darnold may benefit from being Eli Manning’s backup and learning the ropes like Aaron Rodgers did behind Brett Favre in Green Bay, but upon inheriting the starting job, he will also inherit the pressure of succeeding the Manning era, which spanned more than a decade and yielded two championships. It also doesn’t help that Manning has struggled behind one of the most porous offensive lines in the league for the last few seasons: a nightmare Darnold won’t be keen to relive after taking eight sacks against Ohio State to conclude his USC career.
And if he fails to hit the ground running in his new home, Darnold will also have to cope with a media firestorm that will make last season’s ill-fated Heisman Trophy campaign a cakewalk by comparison. As unfair as it may be, Darnold enters the league with the pressure of being both a high draft pick and former Trojan quarterback. Even though Carson Palmer just retired from the NFL with over 45,000 career passing yards, public perception of USC signal callers remains fairly poor following first-round disappointments Matt Leinart and Mark Sanchez.
Of course, the heavier the pressure, the greater the opportunity. Darnold has the chance to be the first Trojan quarterback to play in a Super Bowl, and if he fulfills the potential scouts see in him, he could be immortalized as a franchise savior.
Joe Thomas, the long-time Browns left tackle, was spot-on when he courted free-agent quarterback Kirk Cousins in February.
“I hear Cleveland is nice this time of year,” he tweeted. “[That] is, if you’d like to have a statue someday…”
Indeed, Darnold might get a key to the city if he can bring an end to Browns fans’ decades of suffering or wipe the memory of “The Sanchize” from Jets Nation. There could even be a poetic element to succeeding Manning with the Giants — shades of Mickey Mantle replacing Joe DiMaggio.
Or it could all go wrong: Darnold’s turnover issues could carry over to the next level, or unforeseen injury could derail his career as we have seen with the likes of Andrew Luck and Sam Bradford. Trojan fans won’t think it likely after watching Darnold lose just three games in two years while bouncing off every hit laid on him.
Unlike the start to his collegiate career, however, the 20-year-old won’t be an underdog when beginning his NFL journey. But after Darnold arrived at USC anonymously before departing with a Rose Bowl and conference championship, maybe he’ll find life that much easier starting from the top.
