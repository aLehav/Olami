It seems that with every passing day, two phrases grow in popularity: “Print journalism is dying” and “We are the technologically savvy generation.”
In a way, it is true. Everything is online, and that has hurt the print industry. At the same time, social media is on the rise, and many teenagers and college students have grown up with online networking sites such as Facebook and Twitter.
It seems that the Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism listened to those phrases. The school recently announced that the print journalism and broadcast journalism majors will be changed to print and digital journalism as well as broadcast and digital journalism. This is extremely good news.
Despite the announcement, there is no overt shake up. Current print journalism majors can stay with their current majors and not make the switch, and the change in curriculum has not been immediate. The name change comes on the end of a decade of a journalism school slowly shifting toward online media.
The new major offers insight into three major views on the school’s part: It is not stuck in the past, it is embracing new media and it is not wholly abandoning the basics that have made journalism work. Instead of making a stubborn decision to stay in one era or rabidly jump on every new trend, the school is staying focused on the big picture.
Print journalism, despite what the doomsayers might say, will never die. Yes, newspapers are losing circulation, and profits are falling because of decreased advertisement sales. However, will the The New York Times or Wall Street Journal really fade away? It is highly unlikely. They are major parts of the economic and informational well-being of the country and the world. More than likely, the print industry will continue the trend it is currently on: sharing content with both an online and physical publication. So yes, the actual hard copies are decreasing in circulation, but the institutions of print journalism are still going strong.
There is another reason why print journalism will survive. Even as bloggers and Internet users begin to contribute content as citizen journalists, many still lack the writing format, style and ethics of the print journalism industry.
Newspaper and magazine content is relatively trustworthy because there is a guarantee of oversight. Editors constantly fact check and make sure articles do not violate any ethical standpoint. This allows for a level of impartiality. With rogue news sources such as blogs, there is oftentimes no oversight, and the content has a greater likelihood of descending into an opinionated rant.
By not abandoning the print side of the major, the school is ensuring that, even as print institutions expand to the Internet, the next generation of journalists does not lose its sense of professionalism. And in a time when self-appointed punditry and opinion seem to be all the rage, this is a good sign.
At the same time, the new major’s name suggests an expansion in the courses offered. While the print and digital journalism major is currently identical to the print journalism major in terms of curriculum, that does not mean that new, social media-focused classes won’t emerge in the future.
If those cliché sayings are true, then we really are the tech savvy generation. Sure, Generation X had hacking and a cyberpunk mentality, but college students, no matter what their engineering or computer skills, are familiar with e-mail, social networking and web content, whether they realize it or not.
Looking at news agencies today, there is a sense of clumsiness when it comes to social media. While there are many people at the major news networks who know how to effectively use social media, there sadly is a large number who do not. Pundits who awkwardly ask for Twitter or Facebook comments only hurt their credibility. They clearly do not know what they are talking about. Our generation, with basic knowledge and with classes that might be offered under this new major as it expands, can help integrate social networking with the flow of news.
The new major is nothing revolutionary at the moment, but it shows significant promise. The school seems to understand the necessity to adapt to the changing times, and yet stick with what works. I look forward to progressive new courses.
It looks like I have a new major.

PRINT and BROADCAST journalism are not dying — IDEOLOGICALLY LIBERAL journalism is dying. People want to be able to get objective facts and unbiased news from their media (usually online), then turn to the editorial page or their favorite cable channel for the commentary. All over the country, left-wing newspapers and magazines like the NYT, LAT, WaPo, and Newsweek are losing circulation and flirting with bankruptcy, but strangely, the Wall Street Journal is doing fine. How can we explain that? Could it be that the WSJ doesn’t print editorials on the front page?

Economical woes have been pinned as the source for everything from a stuttering Wall Street to formulaic article leads blaming the economy.
A recent New York Times article, however, pinpointed another institution cracked by financial problems — the higher education grading scale.
The article brought to light a recent trend in law schools around the country to augment graduate students’ grades en masse. Loyola Law School Los Angeles, for example, will be retroactively adding 0.333 to every grade its students have received in the last few years.
Like many professional graduate programs across the country, Loyola’s change in grading structure was put in place to give students a boost in a tougher job climate.
Giving students better chances at law firms — some of which record the grade inflation, others of which don’t — also helps keep the rankings at the school constant in a time when many graduates are unemployed.
“If somebody’s paying $150,000 for a law school degree, you don’t want to call them a loser at the end,” said Stuart Rojstaczer, a former professor at Duke University, in an interview with The New York Times. “So you artificially call every student a success.”
USC’s law school changed its curve last year to be more lenient, as did many West Coast schools, including our crosstown rival.
Grade inflation is one of several gimmicks graduate schools are using to boost their new, fledgling alumni, including paying companies to take them on for trial periods or holding recruiting seminars earlier in the year. But while students can use as much help as they can get in a tough job market, grade inflation is ultimately risky business.
Like monetary inflation, it’s only a matter of time before the value of the letter grade itself decreases exponentially; this trend foretells a bleak future where college grads will be wallpapering their rooms or making fires with diplomas that are worth less than the paper they’re printed on.
Some law schools — such as Stanford — have eighty-sixed letter grades altogether, opting for the pass/fail system. Perhaps this is the way to go — like steroids in professional sports, grade inflation tips the playing field on its end, regardless of which schools take part.
This inflation is a quick fix, but most likely will not be able to ride out the economic turmoil. Schools would do better to rely on padding their career seminars than their students GPAs.

A competitive GPA helps, but isn’t the magic answer to this dismal economy; even if you attend an Ivy. 
Wow commonsense, you act like your MBA is commensurate to going to med school or some other competitve/rigorous program. The study of business is a man-made “science” that tries to predict human behavior in the economy. In a nutshell it’s as futile as a liberal arts degree a la sociology, economics, and the likes. MBAs are a joke.
Either you pass the Bar exam or you don’t; that is what determines who practices law. Grades are irrelevent so a switch to a pass/fail system makes the most sense.  Figures Stanford would be ahead of the curve (pun intended).
Seeing that this writer is a cinema major, I now understand why she has no clue on this matter.

While news of NCAA sanctions imposed on USC stole headlines these past weeks, news of major conference reconfiguration in the college football world will reverberate just as long, if not longer, throughout the league. In a time inevitably shrouded by USC’s doubtful future, for the Pac-10 Conference, a bit of good news came in the form of expansion.
Effective in fall 2011, Utah and Colorado will become official members of the Pac-10, changing the landscape of the conference’s football outlook and  all other sports as well.
“The addition of the University of Utah … continues to strengthen the Pac-10’s goals of becoming the country’s leader in college athletics,” said Larry Scott, the conference’s commissioner.
Colorado will leave the Big 12 Conference and the Mountain West Conference will lose Utah.
“The University of Colorado is a great fit for the conference both academically and athletically and we are incredibly excited to welcome Colorado to the Pac-10,” Scott said.
Furthering the reconfiguration game, Boise State agreed to make the jump from the Western Athletic Conference to the Mountain West Conference, and the Big 12 lost another team when the University of Nebraska announced it would leave in 2011 to join the Big Ten Conference.
The Big Ten’s 12th team signals the institution of a Big Ten championship game beginning in 2011, according to Commissioner Jim Delany.
With Nebraska and Colorado gone, many expected the rest of the Big 12 teams — now numbering only 10 — to entertain offers for membership in other conferences as well.
Some thought the new conference realignments meant that the advent of the long-awaited “super-conference” — featuring perhaps four primary leagues across the nation numbering 16 teams each — was close, but the Big 12’s holding together cut those thoughts short.
Scott and the Pac-10 reportedly hoped to create a Pac-16 by inviting other Big 12 teams, including Texas, Texas A&M, Texas Tech, and the Oklahoma schools.
However, Texas defended its membership in the Big 12 and declined the Pac-10’s offer, saying the remaining teams in the Big 12 would stay together.
The loss of Utah leaves the MWC with nine teams, meaning the conference might not be done courting universities this offseason.
“I can’t predict we are finished, but we are continuing to look to grow the Mountain West Conference,” MWC commissioner Craig Thompson said in a statement.
For now, college fans continue the wait to see which of their favorite teams begin calling a different conference home.

In an effort to better prepare students to enter an industry that is becoming increasingly more focused on the web, the Annenberg School for Communication & Journalism has changed two of the majors it offers to students.
The school informed students Monday that two bachelor of arts degrees — print journalism and broadcast journalism — have been renamed. Annenberg students can now major in “print and digital journalism” and “broadcast and digital journalism” beginning this fall.
Long known for the convergence philosophy behind its curriculum — all Annenberg students take classes in print, broadcast and online journalism, regardless of their specialty — the school made the decision to rename the majors to better reflect what was going on within its classrooms.
Dieuwertje Kast | Summer Trojan
“The change was in recognition of a program that’s really evolved over the last three or four years,” said Kay Heitzman, executive director of public affairs and special events for Annenberg. “The name just wasn’t representing what was going on in journalism education right now.”
Annenberg is also planning an “extensive curriculum rehaul,” according to Laura Castañeda, the assistant director of the School of Journalism. The new majors reflect these upcoming curriculum changes, she said.
“We’re hoping to integrate the majors a lot more than they have been. Traditionally, we’ve tried to converge them at some points,” Castañeda said. “What we’re going to try to do in the future is to integrate them a lot more … students have to learn the fundamentals of all of them.”
Despite the impending changes, school officials have said students currently majoring in either print or broadcast will have to take no additional classes to earn the new degrees. They also have the option to keep the traditional degrees rather than make the switch.
Ultimately, Castañeda said, the name change reflects Annenberg’s ongoing effort to best prepare students for a transitioning journalism industry.
“We were one of the first [schools] to try and change the curriculum a bit and since then a lot of schools have done the same thing. It’s just a continuation of something we started a long time ago,” she said. “We’ve had lots of time to look at the curriculum, reassess it, talk to students about it. It’s something we’re going to be doing every few years.”
Students wishing to change their major to include the digital emphasis should contact Annenberg Student Services or their academic adviser.

Parking spots — always elusive in Los Angeles — are a prized commodity on USC’s campus, and many students have been attempting to grab a spot by whatever means necessary.
This spring and summer have seen a rash of students forging or altering the monthly parking permits that allow access to parking structures on campus. According to DPS Capt. David Carlisle, there have been 18 reports of falsified parking permits since April, with six so far this month.
“It’s a common report,” Carlisle said. “Students try and create a fake parking permit or alter an existing permit, trying to make accurate copies of the permit in order to avoid the monthly parking fee.”
Carlisle said USC Transportation, which patrols the parking lots around campus regularly, has a simple system to catch altered permits. All USC-issued parking permits have corresponding barcodes, which transportation officials can scan to determine their veracity.
If a student’s permit is found to be false or tampered with, USC Transportation immobilizes the car by placing a boot on it, which can only be removed when the owner pays existing parking fees and fines for the fake permit — USC Transportation’s website lists fines as anywhere between $100 and $1,000.
Students whose cars have been booted are also referred to Judicial Affairs for further action.
Carlisle said the influx in permit modifications could be a combination of more forgeries and stricter  enforcement on the part of transportation officers.
Since parking is at a premium, will the new USC Specific Plan help solve this problem?

Unlike the rest of us, musicians have the option of playing secret gigs to show appreciation for their backers — for those times when a thank-you card just isn’t enough.
Android · Janelle Monáe has been called by Sean P. Diddy Combes one of the most important signs of the music producer’s career. - Photo courtesy of Jessica Holmes Photography 
To that end, burgeoning recording artist Janelle Monáe performed an exclusive set Saturday night at legendary music producer Bob Clearmountain’s Berkeley Street Studio in Santa Monica, Calif. Santa Monica’s own KCRW 89.9 FM hosted the event, meaning the public radio station was probably entitled to some of the gratitude the 24-year-old was dishing out to early supporters of her music and career.
With its low lighting and cozy, nicely worn, mix-matched couches, the venue chosen for the performance lent itself well to the tenor of the evening. Somehow the very intimate tone of the small area effected a large, concert-like feel. By 8 p.m., the studio was packed and abuzz with a palpable eagerness for the 5-foot-2-inch, tuxedo-wearing David Bowie protégé.
Though no stranger to the New York and Atlanta underground music scenes, Monáe hopes to break into new markets with the drop of her first full-length LP, The ArchAndroid. The album takes listeners on a psychedelic journey through the past, present and future. Complete with soulful injections of ’60s pop, jazz and experimental sounds of futuristic hip-hop, Monáe’s most recent release also shakes up the norms of the music industry by incorporating scores from musicals, world music, film soundtracks and influences from artists such as Michael Jackson, James Brown and Stevie Wonder.
A consummate musical storyteller, Monáe continues the narrative arc of Cindi Mayweather, the main character from her debut and Grammy-nominated album Metropolis: The Chase Suite, on The ArchAndroid. According to the story Monáe weaves on the new album, Cindi was sent to free the androids of Metropolis from an oppressive secret society that has used time travel to suppress love and freedom throughout the ages.
Monáe performed her material with drama and theatricality, marching on stage robed in black like some kind of angel of death, her two dancers wearing the same thing. She only sang a few songs the entire evening, leading with “Dance or Die.” The song, the second track from The ArchAndroid, describes the violence, ignorance and oppression that exist in Metropolis. In the chorus, Monáe speaks directly to the androids and tells them to keep dancing and keep playing their music to find the peace and freedom they seek.
Later in her set, “Tightrope” allowed Monáe to flaunt her impressive James Brown-like footwork and get the crowd up on its feet and dancing. This energetic song stressed staying focused on what matters most: According to Monáe, that’s making good music.
With the release of The ArchAndroid, Monáe is seeing her career rise to new heights. The young co-founder of the Wondaland Arts Society — a collective of creative songwriters, musicians, producers, dancers, actors and bloggers — will soon be honored by the American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers for her innovative new sounds.
This summer she will also be going on a nationwide tour, occasionally appearing alongside the likes of Erykah Badu, Common, The Roots and Kings of Leon.
Monáe’s unique songwriting and vocal stylings are sure to guarantee her a place in the experimental music pantheon once she gets a firmer footing in the industry, but until then listeners can enjoy watching every step of the star in the making’s progress.

It seems that the only thing the gifted storytellers at Pixar Animation Studios can do better than craft a gorgeous and heartfelt narrative is introduce new strains of guilt to moviegoers.
Out of the box · Andy’s toys find themselves carted off to Sunnyside Day Care Center as the 17-year-old prepares for his departure to college in Toy Story 3. The film was released in theaters on June 18 nationwide. - Photo courtesy of Walt Disney Pictures 
In the wake of 2003’s Finding Nemo, for instance, some still have yet to forgive themselves for tapping on glass fish tanks in their youths. Humans the world over reconsidered their relationships with insects because of 1998’s A Bug’s Life, and 10 years later, WALL-E showed scores of 21st century audiences the error of their wasteful ways.
Besides staying on the cutting edge of the latest in computer wizardry, the technologically innovative animation studio always seems to be one step ahead in the shame game as well. Toy Story 3, the most recent and presumably final installment in Pixar’s industry revolutionizing Toy Story franchise, continued the studio’s trend of beautiful films that make audiences squirm with guilt over something they never knew they needed to feel guilty about. As of Friday, moviegoers can no longer plead ignorance in the event that they commit the unspeakable atrocity of taking the disposal of old toys lightly.
Since releasing the original Toy Story in 1995, Pixar has thrice succeeded in engendering real empathy for its plaything creations. Many fans who have grown up watching the decade-spanning series have become unabashedly attached to the characters from the film, and will be relieved to learn that their emotional investment won’t be without a return. The majority of the franchise’s most beloved characters return in this, the studio’s third foray into animating the inanimate, two notable exceptions being the chronically short-of-breath Wheezy the Penguin and Woody’s sheep-tending love interest, Bo Peep.
Toy Story 3 finds the toy-loving Andy of yesteryear all grown up and, at age 17, gearing up to leave home for college. When the trash bag in which Andy put all his childhood companions — intending to stow them in the attic — is accidentally put out on the street for curbside garbage pick-up, the toys mistakenly conclude that Andy is through with them once and for all.
Thinking themselves abandoned by their owner, the toys are all too happy to hop into a cardboard box full of donations destined for the nearby Sunnyside Day Care. Buzz, Jessie, Bullseye, Rex, Hamm, Slinky Dog, Barbie and Mr. and Mrs. Potato Head are thrilled to arrive in Sunnyside’s idyllic Butterfly Room — a veritable dreamscape for neglected toys. They soon learn that their assignment is actually for the neighboring Caterpillar Room, where the kids are younger and, as they quickly realize, rougher on their toys. But even beyond the gratuitous wear-and-tear, there is something sinister about the Sunnyside chain of command, and Andy’s toys find that getting out of day care might not be nearly as easy as getting in.
Toy Story is that exceedingly rare franchise in which each successive sequel doesn’t merely match the caliber of its predecessor but surpasses it. Toy Story 3 builds on the solid foundation established by the two previous films, retaining their strengths and expanding on them.
State-of-the-art technology has enabled Pixar to consistently release feature-length and short films that reflect the latest in animated moviemaking innovation. Because the available technology has improved substantially since the first Toy Story film debuted in 1995, the studio has had to struggle and sometimes reign itself in to create films that are consistent in their look and feel. Nonetheless, Pixar permitted itself to flaunt its animation prowess on a few separate occasions within the film.
The talented animators showcased their ever-expanding arsenal of technological know-how with a particularly spectacular action sequence that opens the film and also with the introduction of more than 150 new characters like the plush Lots-O’-Huggin’ Bear and a translucent purple octopus called Stretch, both of whom were created to appear to have textures that were previously impossible to render.
All of Pixar’s staggering advances come together for a remarkably beautiful film that, even if not for its engaging story, would merit a watch on the basis of its visuals alone. Cinemas like Hollwood’s El Capitan Theatre — which not only presents the film in tasteful 3-D but offers a supplemental carnival-like experience at the Toy Story 3 Fun Zone — make the film even more worth checking out.
In addition to being a tour de force of digital artistry, Toy Story 3 benefits from great vocal performances by an embarrassment of high profile voice actors. Returning headliners include Tom Hanks as Woody, Tim Allen as Buzz Lightyear and Joan Cusack as Jessie, with Don Rickles (Mr. Potato Head), Wallace Shawn (Rex), Jon Ratzenberger (Hamm) and Blake Clark (Slinky Dog) also reprising their roles to ensure consistency throughout the films. Newcomers Ned Beatty and Michael Keaton — lending their voices to an emotionally burdened Lots-O’-Huggin’ Bear named Lotso and a sartorially savvy Ken doll, respectively — contribute to the already strong vocal cast.
The Toy Story films have always benefited from the complexity and roundness of their characters, and the actors who breathe life into the animators’ creations are more than a little responsible for the delightful believability of the whole toy chest of vibrant personalities.
Of course, Toy Story is principally a plot-driven franchise. Even so, it shouldn’t come as any surprise that the story would be central to Toy Story 3. With nearly 11 years in the interim between the last film and the current one, the perfectionists at Pixar have had ample time to make Toy Story 3 the beautifully polished product that an estimated $109 million-worth of audiences saw in the film’s opening weekend.
That includes perfectionism in the development stages as well, especially in the form of unwillingness to compromise with a subpar or forced-feeling script. The story driving the film feels consequential and high-stakes, but is ultimately engaging for fans who have followed the tribulations faced by Andy’s toys since the mid-’90s. Two emotionally charged scenes that occur near the end of the film — similarly powerful but vastly different — are almost guaranteed to elicit tears, and comparisons to the moving “Carl and Ellie” montage in the beginning of last year’s Up are certainly warranted.
Toy Story 3 is beautiful and unforgettable, and even if it should turn out to be the final chapter in the now-classic series, the brilliant Pixarians responsible already have plenty to be proud of — namely, the wonderful trilogy they will be leaving behind.

Hats off to Rooney: In spite of a barrage of plugs for the band’s newly released record Eureka (the official motto of the Golden State), a set list consisting almost exclusively of songs that could each serve in a pinch as the California anthem and the near-constant waving of a modified version of our state flag by someone stationed alternately onstage or in the standing-room-only crowd, the band’s performance Saturday night at The Music Box at Hollywood’s Henry Fonda Theater somehow managed to never feel more like a gubernatorial campaign rally than a rock concert.
Eureka! · Robert Schwartzman (right) — who once starred opposite Anne Hathaway in 2001’s The Princess Diaries — is now a songwriter, guitarist and vocalist for the quintessentially California rock band Rooney. - Katelynn Whitaker | Summer Trojan 
Experimental four-piece Black Gold and Topanga, Calif.-based The Young Veins — a relatively new venture featuring two former members of pop-punk outfit Panic! at the Disco — both opened for Rooney.
Vocalists Eric Ronick and Than Luu led Black Gold through a half-hour set beginning at 7:30 p.m., with bassist Kerry Wayne-James and guitarist Alistair Paxton filling out the group. Ronick’s charisma and evident appreciation for those who turned out early to hear the group play were patently endearing, and only strengthened an already strong set.
Although chief Panic songwriter Ryan Ross also pens the bulk of The Young Veins’ material, the new project represents the first time Ross has acted in the capacity of a frontman since Brendon Urie stepped up from singing backing vocals when Ross fell ill and began fronting Panic! at the Disco. Ross’ onstage banter with two-time bandmate Jon Walker betrays the musicians’ familiarity and made for a comfortable dynamic. Like Pretty. Odd., Panic’s Beatles-inspired final release before the band’s July 2009 schism, The Young Veins’ sound draws inspiration from retro-rock with its laid back rhythm and vaguely peacenik-y lyrics.
Rooney led off with its 2007 hit “When Did Your Heart Go Missing?” and, despite a new album to promote, still honored the top vote-getting fan requests submitted to the band’s website — all things considered, it was a thoroughly egalitarian set, and one that embraced the band’s past rather than gloss over it.
“Holdin’ On” and “I Can’t Get Enough,” both from Eureka (the latter of which is also the first single) were also very well-received.

After sitting atop the college football world for as long as I can remember, the NCAA Infractions Committee finally laid down the gauntlet on the USC athletics program.
It was like waiting for former Heisman-winning running back Reggie Bush to score a touchdown — you knew it was coming but you weren’t sure when it would exactly happen.
And then it happened.
For all those times Bush imposed his will on helpless linebackers and stifled secondaries, the NCAA has now imposed its will on the USC athletics program — in a big way.
I’m sure I don’t need to remind you of the sanctions.  Maybe the Lakers winning their 16th NBA championship in franchise history diverted some of the attention off the Trojans, but the reality is that the sanctions are still set in stone.
But were the sanctions justifiable and fair?
You might be thinking, “What is the difference between the two?”
Well, just is the root of the word justifiable; the definition means “in accordance with standards or requirements.”
So, in accordance with NCAA rules, the Trojans did violate them — and if you break rules, there is bound to be some consequence.  I agree the punishment handed down on the athletics program was justifiable.
But fair?
I always hear that life isn’t always fair — and I believe that wholeheartedly.  I’ve always wondered why some people have unbelievable athletic talent and I don’t.  It’s like watching Kobe Bryant swish double-clutch, off-balance, fade away 30-foot jump shots — oh, the poor defender,  because that is not fair.
And the sanctions handed down on USC were definitely not fair.
It is a broken system that the NCAA should be responsible for.  ESPN ranks high school athletes like they are future superstars; they glorify these student-athletes to be the next LeBron James and televise games like they are professional athletes.  To put it plain and simple, you might as well pay these ordinary high school student-athletes if you’re giving them extraordinary star treatment.
And high school is only the beginning.  College athletes are showered with attention by the media, fans and, yes, the students — in a sense, they are idols.  And college is just a stepping stone, or roadblock, for some to the professional level — or that is where most athletes probably think they will be in a couple years (that is another problem in itself).
That is where sports agencies and marketers come into the picture.  You have these businessmen waving wads of Benjamins, offering irresistible deals and giving those seems-too-good-to-betrue speeches.  What do you think happens?
Yes, I’d take it too.
The hype and the attention undoubtedly are ingrained into players’ heads.  Heck, if I was shown on television every weekend, rated the No. 5 player overall in the 2012 class and talked about almost nightly on Sportscenter, you can bet that would inflate my ego.
And after collegiate sports, that means taking my game to the professional level — and if I’m hyped that much by the media, you can count it a sure thing that I’ll be playing for the next 15 or 20 years.
But showing college games on national television brings in revenue for the NCAA and so does selling collegiate apparel.  Sure, the NCAA took away all victories in which Bush participated but did they give back the money they earned when he was the face of college football?
I didn’t think so.
And to punish new freshmen recruits for what?
Well, the NCAA essentially placed the blame for the transgressions of another former player on them — and they will have no choice but to endure the punishment for someone else’s cardinal (and gold) sins.
The freshman had no association with Bush and, last time I checked, why should other people be accountable for the actions of somebody else who broke the rules?
It’s like handing out a punishment to an innocent bystander accused of stealing.  In both cases, it’s the wrong place at the wrong time.
Unfortunately, the sanctions are set in stone — USC has said it will appeal, but who knows what will happen after?
A variety of time-taking procedures will be set into motion as soon as the appeal is released, and we really don’t know how long it will take.
For USC football, a turbulent season transitioned into an even more turbulent offseason.  An overall record of 9-4 and a trip to the Emerald Bowl were OK as a consolation prize — or maybe not — but those certainly aren’t expectations the city, the school, or the fans envisioned.
Sometimes, you have to deal with what life gives you whether it be just or unjust — fair or unfair.
Despite all this, the NCAA should take a hard, long look at themselves in the mirror and examine their own blemishes because there are definitely a lot of them.  To say they don’t have any problems to worry about would be a crime — and that would definitely be unjust and unfair.

Former USC guard Dwight Lewis talked often about it.
It was, like many college basketball players, his dream — his eventual goal: being selected in the NBA draft.
Quick · Guard Dwight Lewis, who spent four years as a starter in the Trojan backcourt, has worked out for the New Orleans Hornets and Dallas Mavericks, among other NBA teams, in pre-draft workouts. - Dieuwertje Kast | Summer Trojan 
Thursday, Lewis’ dream may well come true. The 6-foot-5, 215-pound guard has a good shot at landing in the second round of the 2010 NBA draft alongside teammate Marcus Johnson.
“I know it’s something that they’ve dreamed about for the past four years,” said Jio Fontan, a teammate of Lewis and Johnson on the USC squad last season. “I think they’ve both got a shot.”
Both players have been making the rounds in pre-draft circles over the last few months, Lewis reportedly working out for the New Orleans Hornets and Dallas Mavericks and Johnson for the Los Angeles Clippers.
All three of those teams possess second-rounders they could use to select either of the former Trojans.
If they are not selected among the 60 picks making up the two rounds of the draft, Lewis and Johnson will presumably test the undrafted free-agent waters by attempting to latch on to a team through summer-league play, which can lead to more opportunities.
It’s a process many college players have perfected in recent years. Former Marquette guard Wesley Matthews wasn’t selected in the 2009 draft but signed a summer-league contract with the Utah Jazz.
By the time the 2010 playoffs came around, Matthews was starting in Utah’s backcourt and playing  the third-most minutes on the team.
Matthews isn’t all that different a player than Lewis, weighing in just five pounds heavier and owning a similar slashing style of play on the offensive end. The Jazz guard is perhaps more polished defensively than USC’s draft hopeful, but Lewis often earned praise for stout defending during his USC career.
Lewis accomplished a good deal in his four-year Trojan career, becoming the career-leader in games played in USC history while also leading the team in scoring in each of his final two years.
When most players left in a mass exodus at the conclusion of the 2008-2009 season, Lewis stayed — the only returning starter for the 2009-2010 season.
That, combined with his ability to consistently convert clutch shot opportunities late in games, gave him the status as de facto leader of the new era of the USC basketball program under first-year coach Kevin O’Neill.
“Dwight is  definitely a big-time shot-maker,” Fontan said. “And, Dwight, with him having a great career at USC, being drafted would be something that’s big for not only him but for our program too.”
Where Lewis is known as a do-everything-well-but-nothing-great type of player, Johnson’s reputation is very different.
His athleticism trumps most every player in the draft — and his defense isn’t too far behind — but his shooting needs significant work.
For that reason, some NBA draft experts see him as a perfect second-round selection for a team with an established starting five.
Give him structure and an opportunity to develop those shooting skills and Johnson could very well develop into a this-generation edition of 2000’s lightning bolt Darius Miles as a dunking specialist.
“Marcus has that athleticism and the ability to play defense,” Fontan said. “And he’s been working really hard.”
As have the rest of the 100-plus hopefuls who will sit and wait Thursday when the draft begins at 4 p.m. PST on ESPN.
One prospect won’t have to wait: Kentucky point guard John Wall will almost assuredly become the first overall pick of the draft when the Washington Wizards get on the clock Thursday.
After him, most expect Ohio State guard Evan Turner to be the selection of the Philadelphia 76ers, although nothing is set. Other college players expected to go in the lottery include Syracuse forward Wesley Johnson, Georgia Tech forward Derrick Favors, Georgetown forward Greg Monroe and North Carolina forward Ed Davis.
Basketball powers Kentucky and Kansas each have a host of players expected to go high in the draft. The Wildcats have centers DeMarcus Cousins and Daniel Orton, forward Patrick Patterson and guard Eric Bledsoe. The Jayhawks have center Cole Aldrich and guard Xavier Henry — plus point guard Sherron Collins, who is expected to go in the second round.
