Jessica Zhou | Daily TrojanBalancing the budget · Graduate Student Government President Victoria Montrose said that Senators will vote on the budget next week.
Members of the Graduate Student Government discussed plans to revise the GSG budget in order to address transparency issues at their first meeting of the year Monday in the Ronald Tutor Campus Center.
GSG President Victoria Montrose explained that there was controversy last semester surrounding the previous budget, as many believed it lacked transparency. Additionally, there were inaccuracies, such as accounting errors, in the budget, and the administration of the University made changes to GSG’s budgeting procedures that made the budget obsolete. 
The biggest change proposed is the elimination of carryover funds. In previous years, GSG had been able to draw on a reserve of money comprised of funds that had gone unspent in previous semesters. This allowed GSG to allocate funds without entering budgeting for them. 
The revised budget, however, will remove these loopholes, as Senators will have to account for each expense, making sure to capitalize on funds allocated to them each semester, in order to ensure there are none left over. GSG Finance Director Zachary Farbod Molarabi said that GSG was not taking these steps because of a lack of funds, and that revising the budget did not mean that GSG would not be able to afford as many activities as before. 
“Please don’t be misled that we are in the Great Depression,” Molarabi said. “We just want more accountability.”
The funds going into the budget will be given to GSG at the beginning of the year, instead of breaking it up by semester. While there might be slightly less money to spend, due to funds being based on current figures of student enrollment, Montrose made assurances that the new system would alleviate stress associated with uncertainty surrounding the amount of money that would be available in the second semester.
The new budget would eliminate the accounting errors found in the April budget, as well as optimize spending by finding ways to cut back on expenses. 
One way to accomplish this is through refining the language of each  transaction For instance, the Senate Initiatives section of the new budget allocates $3,500 to financing individual Senator projects that may have previously been done through surplus funds. If the project is successful for a year after its inception, the GSG can vote on making it a permanent line item.
“The revised budget shows a push towards transparency and accuracy for where we’re spending our funds,” said Alaina Austel, a second-year PharmD student in the USC School of Pharmacy. “It’s really pushing towards being accountable for how we’re spending our money, and making sure it’s utilized [to the] best of its capabilities. They’re trying to detail through specific wording the rules of each committee and how much of the budget is being projected.”
The new budget still has $30,000 in funds that have yet to be purposed. Montrose proposed for these funds to be added to the Senate Initiatives section, but the final solution will be voted on before the new budget is approved.
Dylan Wilmeth, a PhD candidate in geological sciences, said that the budget is a step in the right direction for efficiently dealing with funds. 
“It definitely seems that more accountability is going to be present. There is a large Excel spreadsheet with hundreds of cells,” Wilmeth said. “The budget is going to be more streamlined as well. You know where the money is going, and that’s really important.”
The meeting also included an introduction by GSG Vice President Kris Coombs, who explained his position and provided updates on the Child Grant Program, which he spearheads. Currently, the program is implementing a separate balance tracker after they ran out of funds during the summer. The program is also reimplementing adviser approval before students can receive a grant to make sure the money is being spent wisely, as well reinstating checks to make sure students have reached out to other sources for funding their research before reaching out to GSG.
The program Kris Coombs runs in the Travel Grant Program, not Child Grant. Though we are also piloting a Child Care Subsidy Program this year, led by Chris Records, Director of Campus Affairs.

Warren Poh | Daily TrojanPowering up · Thirty-six parking spaces on the Health Sciences Campus are reserved to charge electric vehicles beginning this year.
USC Transportation has enhanced the University’s electrical infrastructure to meet the increasing demands for electric vehicle charging stations. This is in response to an increase in the number of people using electric vehicles at both the University Park Campus and the Health Sciences Campus. Currently, both campuses have a total of 58 charging spaces for electric vehicles.
“At this point, we are trying to catch up to demand,” said David Donovan, associate director of HSC.  “There is already sufficient demand for more EV charging spaces, While we hope that people will use them and continue to grow the EV program, right now we are still trying to catch up to the existing demand.”
HSC has 36 charging spaces. The “level” of the station indicates the charging power — the higher the level, the more power and shorter charging time. The San Pablo parking structure at HSC, which has 32 Level II charging spaces, opened last January, while the remaining Level II charging spaces at HSC are in the Biggy parking structure. 
“The Biggy structure is owned by the University, and we built four charging spaces there, which was the only number it could handle from the electrical infrastructure standpoint,” Donovan said. “When we built the new San Pablo structure, we built it keeping in mind the capacity to add new spaces.”
At the moment, there are 22 electric vehicle charging spaces at the UPC, two of which are level III charging stations. The level II spaces are located at the Figueroa Street structure, Grand Avenue structure, Royal Street structure, Downey Way structure, Lot 2 and Lot SSRI. 
“One way to grow the program is to build new construction,” Donovan said. “Those are the big projects coming online next year.”
USC Transportation will be adding 56 level II charging stations at UPC by the end of Spring 2017. Twenty-four of these stations will be constructed at the University Village, and the remaining 32 stations will be at the USC Shrine building. In total, there will be 114 electric vehicle charging spaces available across both the campuses for those with a USC permit.
“The 114 EV charging spaces are as many as we can put in right now,” Donovan said. “We have already maxed out the University’s electrical infrastructure in terms of adding spaces to existing facilities.”
According to Donovan, if required later, they could add more new construction or do a massive redesign of the University’s existing electrical infrastructure, but that is not expected to happen anytime soon.
Even with an increase in the number of charging stations, the spaces are limited. Hence, any vehicle that is parked in that space and plugged into the charging station must be actively charging at all times. Otherwise, the owner may be cited for reserved space violation, according to the USC Transportation Rules & Regulations Handbook. The handbook also states that any vehicle parked in the EV space without a USC permit, without being plugged in and actively charging, or parked in an EV space after charging has been completed, will be fined $80 for a reserved space violation. The rate for using the charging station is $0.25/hr., in addition to the permit rate.
According to Karla Heidelberg, director of the USC Environmental Studies Program and associate professor of biological sciences and environmental studies at the Dornsife College of Letters, Arts and Sciences, USC’s commitment to installing more electric charging stations is a positive move that helps to promote awareness of alternative technologies that make the U.S. less dependent on oil imports.
“With much of our petroleum imports located in politically volatile countries, the United States is vulnerable to price spikes and supply disruptions,” Heidelberg wrote in an email to the Daily Trojan. “Facilitating the use of hybrid and plug-in electric vehicles instead of conventional vehicles can help reduce U.S. reliance on imported petroleum and increase energy security.”
Similarly, Heidelberg said, the use of electric vehicles will also help move the U.S. toward a more environmentally-friendly future by reducing emissions.
“As Provost Michael Quick has noted, we must prioritize and transform education to address difficult and intractable ‘wicked’ problems such as sustainability, so that our students become comfortable as future leaders that continue these beginning efforts,” Heidelberg wrote. “Hopefully this is one of many future steps to make USC a greener university.”
Students such as Jereme Barnett-Woods, an electrical engineering graduate student, applauded the University’s actions because of the benefits that they see from the proliferation of electric charging stations.
“The increase in EV charging stations will help convince people who want to buy an electric vehicle to actually get one since it allows them more freedom with where they can travel to,” Barnett-Woods said.

The USC Shoah Foundation Center for Advanced Genocide Research held its first conference on the Guatemalan genocide this week to bring together researchers for informative panels on the little-known history of this era in Latin America. The conference, “A Conflict? Genocide and Research in Guatemala,” began Sunday and will continue through Wednesday.
Attendees included award-winning activist and professor Victoria Sanford, as well as Fredy Peccerelli, a forensic anthropologist and 1999 winner of the CNN and Time Magazine “50 Latin American Leaders for the New Millennium.” 
In the 1980s, the Mayan people were targeted within Guatemala for protesting against a repressive government. According to the Holocaust Museum of Houston, around 200,000 people went missing or were killed, and 1.5 million people were displaced when the Guatemalan army obliterated villages. The conflict lasted around 36 years and ended with the 1996 Oslo Accords. However, since the 1990s, the genocide has been somewhat pushed aside and forgotten. 
The Shoah Foundation’s mission is to share the stories of genocide survivors through the platform of audio-visual interviews. The organization has collected close to 53,000 survivor testimonies from 63 countries in 41 languages and hopes that their videos will help to better convey the lives of the survivors and teach future generations. The Shoah Foundation and its partners aim to bring attention to the genocide and share the unheard stories of the Guatemalan victims. 
Brigitte Suhr, an attendee that worked in Guatemala through the Guatemalan Truth Commission, emphasized the need to stay up-to-date with what is happening in the country. Like many participants, Suhr hopes to see an increased awareness of the genocide and accurate representations of the accounts of the victims. 
Sanford, a professor at Lehman College, presented a similar idea in her speech.
“We know this knowledge must be shared,” Sanford said. “How do we keep the voices and the survivors at the front?” 
Fredy Peccerelli, who worked with the Mayan peoples as a member of the Guatemalan Forensic Anthropology Foundation, painted a picture of the “raw emotions” of the people in the community. With the help of families, Peccerelli and his crew have been able to further research the conflict and identify genocide victims. Furthermore, through collaboration with the Shoah Foundation, 217 interviews have been conducted and the victims have shared stories of rape, mass murder, the loss of loved ones and the psychological aftermath of a genocide.
Conference speakers emphasized that genocides are not a thing of the past, as there are ongoing genocides in Syria and throughout Africa; however, through education, future generations can learn how to tackle these issues. 
“Education is one solution to the problem, along with certain political matters, so it’s a complex of things,” said Wolf Gruner, director of the Shoah Foundation. “But we need to change so genocide will not happen again. First and foremost, we want to raise awareness and spread knowledge.” 
Stephen Smith, UNESCO co-chair on genocide education and a member of the Shoah Foundation, explained that through resources like Shoah Foundation’s iWitness — the online compilation of all the video interviews that the foundation conducts — younger generations can learn and prevent mass genocides. 
“We really can’t compare human suffering, but the causes and consequences of violence in genocidal societies we need to understand better and deeper,” Smith said. “Our attitudes really do matter to the way in which the world works.” 
The conference is one in a series of events meant to address genocide in Latin America, including a conference co-hosted with UNESCO last Friday. The Shoah Foundation also partnered with Visions and Voices to bring Rebeca Lane, a Latin-American hip-hop artist, to campus on Tuesday. Lane was raised during the time following the Guatemalan Civil War and Guatemalan genocide and is not only an artist, but also an activist, sociologist and educator.

The online, progressive-leaning show The Young Turks premiered live on the TV channel Fusion at Wallis Annenberg Hall on Monday.
The show kicked off its live 12-week college tour at USC. It accompanies a weekly show in which the hosts discuss political issues and world events.
The live show featured a panel, which included hosts Ana Kasparian and John Iadarola, the show’s creator Cenk Uygur and Nando Vila, the vice president of programming at Fusion and a commentator on the show. The panelists discussed current issues such as the legalization of marijuana, climate change and college tuition with a live audience composed of USC students.
Olivia Deveau, a freshman majoring in journalism, said that she wished there was more female representation on the panel. However, she appreciated the point of view that the lone female panelist, Kasparian, offered.
“I don’t necessarily agree with [Kasparian] because of her past opinions,” Deveau said. “[But] it was nice to hear her say some things that I really do agree with and hear her advocate for the millennials.”
The panel also focused on the importance of young voters in the next election, who Kasparian said should not be underestimated. 
“When you hear about young people in the news, it is typically negative,” Kasparian said. “They’re not lazy, they’re the most educated generation. A lot of the criticisms are unfair.”
While all the panelists agreed that millennials will be a deciding factor in the election, Uygur said that calling millennials “smarter than their parents” on TV is “toxic” for older television viewers.
“They can swing an election if they get active. As progressive as millennials are, watch out — -we could make a tremendous difference,” Uygur said. 
Uygur and Iadarola agreed on the influence young people have on the election. Iadarola explained that The Young Turks has been influencing the media with what the show is doing online. On YouTube, the show dubs itself “The Largest Online News Show in the World.”
“We feel that we can take what makes TYT different and superior and try to spread it,” Iadarola said. “It will make us better and other media better.”
Though the show is followed by a wide array of students for its progressive ideals and leanings toward Bernie Sanders, members of the Armenian community have been against the show’s title, which Armenian Students’ Association member Syunik Zohrabyan called “inflammatory.”
Zohrabyan explained that a political group in the Ottoman Empire called the “Young Turks” implemented the systematic genocide of the Ottoman Armenians and other ethnic groups of the empire in 1915.
“What if this was instead the ‘The Neo-Nazis’ or ‘The KKK’ coming to speak and broadcast live from Annenberg to discuss global climate change?” Zohrabyan said. “For USC to give a platform to an organization that glorifies a government killing its own people is degrading to this University’s reputation.”
Uygur explained that the show’s name “has nothing to do” with the historical reference.
“Young Turks means young progressives looking to overthrow the established system,” Uygur said. “There’s a common English definition of that phrase, and that’s what we’re going for.”
Matthew Yeh, a senior majoring in business, said he has been following the show for more than five years, and felt “starstruck” seeing the journalists he loves.
“Unlike mainstream media, they are very honest and talk about things that aren’t usually talked about,” Yeh said. “They aren’t afraid of taking the position that not a lot of people agree with.”
Despite his following of the show and interest in topics they cover, Yeh said he is not sure if he will cast his vote in the upcoming election in November.
“I’m not well-versed, so I don’t want to make an uneducated vote, but it seems to me that one vote won’t make a difference,” Yeh said. “But the show explained that millennials being involved in the elections is crucial to make change.”
The Young Turks will continue to tape their show from different universities across the country for the next 11 weeks. The show will broadcast from George Washington University in Washington, D.C. next Monday.

Trevor Sochocki | Daily TrojanScoring machine · The men’s water polo team does not lack prolific finishers, and Lachlan Edwards delivered 11 goals over the weekend.
Men’s water polo’s junior 2-meter Lachlan Edwards claimed his first MPSF Player of the Week award after a scoring barrage over the weekend for the No. 2-ranked Trojans.
Edwards recorded 11 goals in three matches over the weekend in wins over UC Santa Barbara, Whittier and LaVerne to lead USC in scoring. He had a hat trick against the Gauchos, and 4 goals each against the Poets and Leos, tying a career high in goals set last season. His 12 goals so far this year is second on the team to fellow junior driver Mateo Morelli’s 13.
The Australia native is no stranger to finding the back of the net. Edwards scored 31 goals as a true freshman in 2014, and last season was third in scoring on the team with 40 goals, putting up 11 multi-goal matches. He also earned All-American Second Team, All-MPSF Second Team and NCAA All-Tournament Second Team honors last year.      
The No. 2-ranked men’s water polo team is off to another hot start as it seeks another NCAA championship appearance. The team has begun the season 5-0 and faces Stanford in Palo Alto on Saturday in a match televised on the Pac-12 Network.

It’s no surprise that USC’s football team is the focus of campus in the fall. They’re preparing for their first conference game against No. 7 Stanford this Saturday. But although all the attention is on them, there are other teams in the fall who have started their seasons strong and deserve support from Trojan fans as well. 
The No. 2 men’s water polo team deserves national attention in its own right. They’ve won nine national championships, six of those consecutively from 2008 to 2013. They’re 5-0 right now and dominated their competition this past weekend, outscoring three opponents 67-7. 
The Trojans have consistently been dominant in the pool in recent seasons, which makes for a fun time as a fan. Junior Lachlan Edwards led the team with 11 goals in their three weekend matches. Their near constant success makes for an entertaining and enjoyable time for Trojan fans. 
They will also make the trip up to Palo Alto to face No. 5 Stanford in their first MPSF match of the season on Saturday. 
The women’s soccer team had a huge 3-0 upset of No. 8 North Carolina on Sunday, handing the Tar Heels their first loss of the season. It’s a huge victory against a historic women’s soccer program, and the first win in four matches against UNC. It was the most goals the Tar Heels have allowed since a 4-3 overtime loss back in 2011. The victory was the fifth-straight game where redshirt senior goalie Sammy Jo Prudhomme and her defense allowed no goals. 
The Women of Troy also beat LMU on Friday 2-0, with senior midfielder Morgan Andrews leading the team with two goals on the weekend. 
Between women’s soccer’s two home matches, there was an average attendance of 510. That’s approximately 300 fewer than their opponents this season have averaged. It’s already a higher average attendance than last season (498), but it’s barely a third of their opponents’ average attendance last season of 1,524. 
The Women of Troy are a dynamic, exciting team on a five-match win streak. With a dominating win against the Tar Heels under their belt, USC has the momentum to make noise this season and compete for the top spot in the Pac-12. 
The No. 21 women’s volleyball team is also on a long win streak. After dropping their first three matches of the season, the Women of Troy have won six straight matches and 10 of their last 11 sets. They won the Rice Adidas Invitational this past weekend. Senior middle blocker Elise Ruddins was named the tournament’s Most Valuable Player with 25 kills and 16 blocks. She was joined on the All-Tournament team by junior opposite hitter Brittany Abercrombie and freshman outside hitter Khalia Lanier. Abercrombie had 25 kills and eight blocks and Lanier had 36 kills, eight blocks and five aces through the weekend.
Attendance has also been less than optimal on the court: So far, there has been an average of 626 people in attendance in the Women of Troy’s six home matches. Last season, when the Trojans were the top team in the nation for the majority of the season, they averaged 1,705 in attendance, but their opponents’ average was still more — 2,127 fans. 
Despite their rough start, the Women of Troy have found a rhythm and consistency on the court. Their matches at the Galen Center are interesting and entertaining. The atmosphere is lively and a great time for USC fans. They host the Pac-12 Challenge this week and will face Oklahoma and Maryland on Thursday and Friday, respectively. 
Taking a look at the attendance figures is indicative that the Trojan Nation can do more to support USC’s teams. Just because football captures the attention of most people, these teams are playing well and feature a great atmosphere to cheer them on. 
There is no doubt that all eyes will be on the gridiron in Palo Alto come Saturday, but it’s important to remember that USC has other programs that deserve their fair share of attention.

Benjamin Dunn | Daily TrojanCarryover hopes · Senior wide receiver Darreus Rogers had a career high seven catches in Saturday’s win. He was one of 10 wide receivers who made grabs, a trend that the Trojans hope continues against Stanford.
USC started off its post-Alabama schedule with a 45-7 blowout win over Utah State on Saturday at the Coliseum, though there is still room for improvement. 
For a team that was beaten 52-6 by the No. 1 Alabama Crimson Tide at AT&T Stadium in Arlington, Texas, just a week ago, Saturday’s win was necessary. To not only be beaten in a season opener for the first time in 14 years, but to fall by 46 points in front of millions dealt a huge blow to the confidence of the USC football program.
After the 46-point defeat, head coach Clay Helton said that what happened was not a true representation of his team’s potential. 
“Obviously one game does not make a season,” he said. “[The Crimson Tide] played to their potential. The cold hard truth is we did not play up to ours.”
On Saturday against Utah State, the Men of Troy played to their potential on all sides of the ball despite some minor hiccups.
Discounting sophomore left tackle Chuma Edoga’s undisciplined ejection early on, USC was efficient on offense, punting just twice all game, far less than the  nine punts it kicked against Alabama. Redshirt junior starting quarterback Max Browne and backup redshirt freshman Sam Darnold seemed to settle into their respective roles as they combined for 28-of-37 passing for 244 yards and four touchdowns through the air. 
In contrast to 2015, USC quarterbacks spread the ball around the field, hitting 10 different receivers as senior wide receiver Darreus Rogers led all Trojans with 82 receiving yards off of seven catches. 2015’s leading receiver junior JuJu Smith-Schuster caught seven passes as well for a total of 56 yards and two touchdowns. 
The visible improvement in Rogers will be something that Browne and Darnold could potentially exploit down the stretch, with Smith-Schuster likely to draw added coverage. 
On the ground, USC executed with even more different faces than the receiving corps. On Saturday, nine USC rushers gained a total of 178 yards and a touchdown on 44 carries (4.0 yard average). While the Trojans’ yards per carry average against Utah State can be improved from runners such as heavy-duty back sophomore Ronald Jones II, sophomores Dominic Davis and Aca’Cedric Ware — along with Darnold — gave USC hope in its rushing attack. 
Though, looking ahead to Stanford this Saturday, the Men of Troy are coming in as heavy underdogs. 
For a defense that allowed just 49 yards on 26 carries to Utah State, this week will test the physical and mental toughness of USC’s run defense.
Not only does Stanford feature Heisman hopeful Christian McCaffrey, but it also includes one of the most stout offensive lines in the Pac-12.
“It’s basically weight room against weight room,” redshirt senior Stevie Tu’ikolovatu said to ESPN. “I think the thing we need to do is be stout in the middle and expect those downhill runs all game and just prepare our body for it because we’re going to be sore the next day.”
For a Stanford offense devoid of any superstars in the pass game, McCaffrey is a majority of the Cardinal offense. This season, the Castle Rock, Colorado, native has rushed for 126 yards and two touchdowns on 22 carries with 40 yards on seven receptions. McCaffrey can simply do it all, which is a blessing and a curse for a USC defense that allowed 465 yards of total offense to Alabama, including 242 rushing yards and a 73-yarder by Damien Harris. 
If USC is going to upset Stanford in Palo Alto, the team will have to increase their mental toughness this week in practice and on the road. Ejections from offensive linemen, drive-killing penalties and other mental errors will need to take a back seat against a potential playoff team.
Though USC will be tempted to go for big plays on the defensive side, ultimately consistent containment and third-down play will end up having more of an effect on the game. Early on against Alabama, USC was dominant, recording four sacks, but failed to contain Alabama, especially around the goal line as freshman QB Jalen Hurts took two rushes in for touchdowns of seven and six yards, respectively. 
Saturday’s game against Stanford will be a statement game for a USC season in flux. Either the Trojans will rebound back into the national conversation, or be a setback as USC looks toward a daunting schedule against tough opponents in Washington, Oregon, UCLA and Notre Dame.

Sophomore left tackle Chuma Edoga has lost his starting job but will not face a suspension following an ejection in last Saturday’s game against Utah State for shoving an official, head coach Clay Helton announced on Sunday.
Edoga’s ejection came in the first quarter of USC’s 45-7 win over the Aggies. Edoga was pushed to the ground by Utah State linebacker Alex Huerta on a play where redshirt junior quarterback Max Browne was sacked, but retaliated by throwing a punch at Huerta. Edoga then stood up and appeared to run toward Huerta. When the official attempted to restrain him, Edoga pushed the official, drawing a flag and an ejection.
“Poor decision by a young person who got over-emotional,” Helton said after the game. “[Edoga’s] got to be smarter. There’s no excuse. That could cost you a game. As you can tell, we’re still learning as a team.” 
Since the ejection occurred during the first series of the game, the Pac-12 stated that no further suspension was necessary because the ejection constituted a full game. 
In USC’s latest depth chart, redshirt senior Chad Wheeler is listed ahead of Edoga at the left tackle position. Wheeler, who has been battling plantar fasciitis, took over for Edoga after the ejection and will start against Stanford on Saturday.
“I had a chance to talk to Chuma, and he was embarrassed by it and it doesn’t reflect who he is,” Helton said to ESPN. “He got caught up in the moment and got overly emotional and made a poor decision.”
Redshirt senior offensive tackle Zach Banner also weighed in after the game.
“Extremely disappointed in Chuma [Edoga] today,” he told ESPN.
Edoga’s ejection is the latest in a string of concerns both on and off the field for USC. In the opener against Alabama, redshirt senior defensive end Jabari Ruffin was ejected for stomping on an opponent’s groin and was suspended for the first half of the Utah State game. Two other players — sophomore linebacker Osa Masina and redshirt sophomore defensive end Don Hill — are currently indefinitely suspended for their involvement in a sexual assault investigation.

Brian Chin | Daily TrojanDynamic Darnold · Sam Darnold hands the ball off to sophomore Aca’Cedric Ware. The redshirt freshman is a dual-threat quarterback.
Look down the list of starting quarterbacks at USC in recent history and the names leave no doubt that — over time — each one emerged as a clear-cut leader under center, from Cody Kessler to Matt Barkley to Mark Sanchez.
Things are a little more uncertain this time around. While head coach Clay Helton tapped redshirt junior Max Browne to succeed Kessler, Helton has also made sure to give playing time to redshirt freshman Sam Darnold, the youngster who forced a spirited quarterback competition.
“The performance by Sam Darnold at such a young age in both spring and fall camps has made us very confident as a staff that Sam could enter any game and our offense would not miss a beat,” Helton said last month when he announced Browne as the starter. “Though we will not rotate quarterbacks, we do envision using Sam’s unique athletic skill set for special situations throughout games this season.”
Through two games, Helton has stuck to his word. Darnold spelled Browne for two series in the opener against Alabama. Against Utah State on Saturday, the redshirt freshman was installed in a red zone situation early in the second quarter and then played the entirety of the fourth quarter.
While Browne is still clearly the No. 1 man, Darnold is right behind him and giving Helton reasons for more playing time.
“We were up 31-7, and thought it was a great opportunity being up four scores that it was his opportunity to get better,” Helton said, explaining why Darnold took over in the fourth quarter on Saturday. “He’s one snap away from being a starter. He did a great job. Came in and provided us with two touchdowns.”
Darnold said after the game that he wasn’t surprised he played extended time.
“We had a pretty comfortable lead,” he said. “I don’t think I’m going to throw a lot of pick-sixes to change that. I’m happy with the coaches trusting me to put me in that situation.”
On Darnold’s first play in the red zone during the second quarter, he connected on a screen pass to sophomore wide receiver Deontay Burnett for a 13-yard touchdown. His second touchdown pass came on a 15-yard strike to junior wide receiver JuJu Smith-Schuster, threading the needle on target through several Utah State defenders.
Darnold knew “pretty soon” that Smith-Schuster would find an opening.
“In the red zone, we knew they play cover-4 and they like to zone off that linebacker,” he said. “I knew that JuJu was going to be able to sneak in right behind [the defender]. It was a great play call.”
The throw seemed as great as the play call. Darnold’s main strength is his ability to be a dual-threat — he has a strong arm and is able to zip the ball to receivers while being able to extend a play and run for yardage.
“I’m definitely trying to get the tempo up because the defense doesn’t know what’s coming,” Darnold said on his style of play. “Tempo’s a huge key when I go out there and play ball.”
In contrast, Browne has a strong pocket presence and has been touted for being an efficient game manager. But Darnold has picked up a few tips from his counterpart.
“He does a great job of staying in the pocket and being able to step in and throw when you know there’s guys around him,” Darnold said on Browne. “That’s something I’ve learned from him because usually, when there’s pressure I like to escape, try to make plays even when I can stay in there and make a throw.”
Darnold’s situation is unique. As a redshirt freshman, he is the presumed quarterback of the future — just as Browne was when he waited behind Kessler for multiple seasons.
But unlike Browne’s tenure as a backup, Darnold is being used in crucial situations, such as in the red zone or on third-and-short plays. His opportunities will be limited, but they will also come in high-pressure situations, meaning he is often coming in cold off the bench.
“It’s pretty hard,” Darnold said. “Coaches and people watching on TV, they don’t really care. They just want production.”
Darnold admitted he felt pressured to make a big play and impress right away. He grieved over one play during the Utah State game when, instead of handing the ball off to a running back, he pulled it back and wound up getting sacked.
Though he warms up on the sidelines every series, nothing replaces actual game experience.
“It’s always good to get those reps,” Darnold said. “On any play, Max could go down, and I’m the guy now.”
Speaking to the media after the game, Darnold did not bite when repeatedly asked about wanting to be the starter. Though, for Browne, knowing the talent right below him on the depth chart has to be interesting.
“It’s different, but if it helps our team I’m all for it,” Browne said on Darnold replacing him in the red zone. “I think the past three or four years has taught me to mentally roll with anything.”
He may have to roll with Darnold being on his heels for a while. On a day when Browne threw his first touchdown pass, so did Darnold. On a day when Browne had his long-awaited chance to lead USC to a victory, Darnold was a contributing factor and received almost as much attention.
In fact, they both have the same amount of touchdowns — two. And despite a smaller sample size, Darnold’s quarterback rating through two games is 155, while Browne’s sits at 107.4. But Browne has a slight edge in completion percentage — 62.7 perecent compared to 60 percent for Browne.
Darnold said he and coaches discuss nearly every day at practice which situations he will be inserted into, and that he has to be ready when called upon — even after an extended period on the sidelines.
“When we’re in the red zone or in close third downs, I know my number can be called at any time,” he said. “I’ve got my mouth piece ready and my chin strap in. When they say, ‘One-four, get in the game,’ I’m ready.”
Barring a letdown from Browne, this will be Darnold’s role — waiting his turn and attempting to showcase his abilities whenever he has the chance. If it all goes accordingly, though, Browne will soon pass the baton to him, and all the reps he received as a redshirt freshman will become valuable experience for Darnold.
“It’s a great grooming tool for him,” Helton said.

During my junior year of high school, my friend Billy, who is my guru for everything in the world of electronic music, showed me something called a boiler room on YouTube after a session of mixing music. He explained to me that these were invite-only shows where an artist, usually a DJ-producer hybrid, would show up and play a set of his or her music as well as music he or she personally loved for an extended period of time. In the particular boiler room that Billy showed me, a guy named Kaytranada was playing a show in Los Angeles. It was incredible.
 How a guy like this could have escaped me at the time was beyond me, but I instantly fell in love with his song selections in the show, which were a mix of original songs, remixes and old-school jams that I nerd out over every time I hear their opening riffs. Needless to say, Kaytranada stole my heart that night, and the more I watched his other boiler rooms and interviews, the more I got to like him.
He had an unhealthy love for ’90s R&B, hip-hop and a neo-soul sound, much like I did. It was like someone had raided my Spotify playlists and meshed them all together to make something new and interesting. As a person, he’s very mellow and laid-back, especially around people he doesn’t know too well, but when the music is playing, he’s in his own world and he dives in head first. He’s quirky and hilarious, making up a lot of dance moves on the fly and just going along with whatever his body is doing with the music in the background playing. Much like an angsty suburban pre-teen discovering Linkin Park for the first time, I thought to myself, “Finally! Someone who understands me!”
 Fast forward to May of this year, during a trip back to my home state of Michigan. Before heading up to Ann Arbor for a weekend with some of my buddies, Spotify gives me a notification saying that Kaytranada has finally released a full-length album called 99.9%. Of course, this new album accompanied the entire car ride, and my high expectations were not only matched, but also exceeded. 
The best way I try to describe Kaytranada’s style to people who have never heard it before is say that it’s “boogie” music. It has many elements that old disco and R&B tunes had: the typical “four on the floor” sound, snares that crack and pop louder than a fresh bowl of Rice Krispies and catchy instrumentals all throughout the majority of his songs. In addition, his unique bass and synth sounds are guaranteed to make a beat that will have you moving in your seat. At times, it comes together in a way that is very difficult to put a label on, and for those songs, instead of trying to place it in a genre for people to relate to, I simply tell them they have to listen and judge for themselves.
 99.9% doesn’t deviate at all from this sound, so I was more than happy to have Kaytranada doing what he does best on a studio album. Songs like “TRACK UNO,” “LITE SPOTS” and “BULLETS” radiate that trademark Kaytranada-boogie feel. I swear, the bass is so profound in these songs; you feel it in your entire body, making every nerve and blood cell bump along to the beat.
 Kaytranada also has tons of indie superstars make appearances on this album, some of which made me geek out in excitement when I saw their names. Craig David makes an appearance on this album. For those of you who don’t know, Craig David had one of the hottest R&B tracks back in the day called “Fill Me In,” and then, just like that, he was gone, becoming a forgotten remnant of my childhood like I Spy books. However, for the track “GOT IT GOOD,” David comes out of irrelevancy and shows that his vocals haven’t faded after all of these years, and the way he harmonizes over a grimy bass and uplifting synths makes a match made in heaven.
Vic Mensa also makes an appearance on this album on the song “DRIVE ME CRAZY,” lending his syncopated rhyming to a Kaytranada beat that switches between minimalistic to angelic to make a great go-to song for people looking for a more alternative rap song, which rings true for many, since the song was released as a single before the album dropped.
 This album also introduced me to Anderson .Paak, who is finding a lot of success these days with a new album and an appearance on Schoolboy Q’s new album Blank Face LP. .Paak’s raspy voice and ability to glide over a track contrast perfectly with the beat on “GLOWED UP.” The bass and snare hit so hard on this album that when I first heard it in the car, the rearview mirror shook like Jell-O in an earthquake. This is one of the most interesting beats I’ve heard this year, since the bass and snare are aggressive with no relent, but the uplifting synths mellow the entire song out, creating a lovely yin and yang effect.
 For me, this was the perfect album to start my summer off right with. It had a perfect mix of songs that could move my feet without fail, but it also had a good blend of songs to just sit back and relax to. With the wind blowing through my hair and the sun beating down on my face, I thought back to when I first heard Kaytranada in a basement a couple of years ago, and I thought that nothing had changed that much.
 He was a role model then, and he still is. He’s someone who isn’t afraid to put him and his alternative music taste out there for people to form an opinion about, and he’s found success doing it. By sharing very similar music interests, it’s easy to see a small fraction of myself in Kaytranada and his special brand of weirdness. It’s easy to go along with the flow and play what the crowds want to hear, but Kaytranada plays what he wants to hear, and if the crowds don’t like it, tough. That kind of individuality is important as an artist, and to this day, I still struggle to find the middle ground of personal passion and pandering when it comes to my own creative endeavors. So, here’s to you, Kaytranada, and thank you for showing me that being weird isn’t what loses the interest of your fans; it’s not being authentic.

Photo courtesy of USC Glorya Kaufman School of DanceFocus on him · William Forsythe (above) founded the The Forsythe Company in 2005 after building a career in ballet and visual arts. In Fall 2015, he joined the USC Kaufman School of Dance as a professor.
For the first time, the USC community will have the opportunity to glimpse into the mind of renowned choreographer William Forsythe.
“Focus Forsythe: The Choreographer’s Process” is a lecture presented by Visions and Voices in conjunction with the USC Glorya Kaufman School of Dance. A combination of both performance and discussion, “Focus Forsythe” will be the first time Forsythe will discuss and engage in his creative process with the entire USC community since he joined the faculty at Kaufman in 2015. 
The unique event will open with a performance, by Kaufman students featuring Forsythe’s choreography, and continue into a conversation with Forsythe. The discussion will be moderated by Jodie Gates, vice dean and director of the Kaufman School of Dance. Joining them will be Jill Johnson, dance director at Harvard University and Christopher Roman, artistic director of DANCE ON ENSEMBLE, both of whom regularly work and collaborate with Forsythe. The conversation will revolve around how Forsythe’s creative inspirations impact the process and driving force of his work.
Forsythe has worked professionally in the dance scene for more than 45 years. He danced early in his career with the Joffrey Ballet and Stuttgart Ballet and later proceeded to even found his own company, The Forsythe Company. Forsythe is applauded for reshaping the classical form of ballet into a modern, dynamic genre and has significantly worked to advance dance as an art form. His undeniable legacy has earned him the title of Commandeur des Arts et des Lettres by the government of France and the selection in 2002 as a founding Dance Mentor for The Rolex Mentor and Protégé Arts Initiative. 
Forsythe has also created new technological methods of dance education, documentation and research as well. He collaborated on the computer application, “Improvisation Technologies: A Tool for the Analytical Dance Eye,” which was developed in 1994 and is utilized as a teaching tool by professionals across the working dance industry and academic world. Forsythe launched “Synchronous Objects for One Flat Thing” in 2009, which is a digital program that allows the user to visualize choreography.
“Focus Forsythe” marks the launch of “Fall for Forsythe,” a celebration of Forsythe’s innovative work, which will last through the month of October. “Fall for Forsythe” is presented by the Kaufman School of Dance, The Music Center and the Los Angeles County Museum of Art, and it will encompass various events ranging from student and professional dance performances to lectures by Forsythe. The festivities will culminate Oct. 21 to 23 in a grand, final performance at The Music Center with performances by Houston Ballet and San Francisco Ballet among other spectacular dancers.

The filmmaking industry has always been known as an “all-boys club,” but that nickname is something USC’s Women of Cinematic Arts is taking concrete steps to fix it. “Hollywood is often referred to as a ‘male-dominated industry,’ and that’s because the men in power hire their friends, who are also men,” said Sarah Jones, president of WCA.
This is the inaugural year of their Feminist Media Festival, a year-long event that will accept and judge student work, host workshops on a multitude of media-related topics and connect students to a wide network of filmmakers, professors and alumni.
“WCA has been around forever, and we’ve always kind of supported minorities in cinema,” Jones said. “The issue is, we found that we’d be meeting and talking about these issues, which is helpful to understand them, but nothing we did would actually solve them.”
An idea first envisioned last spring by WCA board member Neda Davarpanah, the Feminist Media Festival quickly became, according to Jones, a “collaborative effort” between both WCA’s alumni and student boards. Aided by former President Allison Begalman, Jones and her team worked through the summer to plan the festival.
For WCA, the festival’s emphasis on networking and community building is crucial in making tangible change. It is important to Jones that the festival is embedded “in the context of making content and encouraging people to network and actually [make] solid connections.” This networking mindset also factors into the types of media the festival will accept: Short films, up to eight minutes long, in genres ranging from documentary to narrative to experimental, as well as animated and interactive content. The festival does not, however, accept scripts, a deliberate choice, Jones said. Screenplays are oftentimes written by individuals, and the culture the festival wishes to promote a culture of teamwork and community.
Those who wish to submit projects must first register for the festival, which includes a $5 fee. All work is due by March 1. Half of the team must be female, and projects must encompass the festival’s theme of “Overcoming Adversity,” as well as pass the Bechdel test (i.e. feature two women who are shown discussing something that is not a man).
The workshop portion of the festival is something WCA hopes will focus on both creative and practical aspects of the industry, with topics on gender representation and also life after graduation for film students. Since the workshops will run through spring, WCA plans to structure them based on topic according to what Jones calls the “traditional production structure.” Fall semester will focus on workshops in development, casting and pre-production. As the year progresses, topics will veer toward production and eventually post-production and distribution, following the chronology of a film being made.
The festival is open to students of all genders and fields of study.
“Feminism is everyone’s issue. It’s not just a woman’s issue,” Jones said. “And it’s going to get solved by everyone coming together to address gender representation in media, whether that’s negative representation of women or unrealistic representation of men.”
The opening ceremonies for the Feminist Media Festival will be held on Sept. 15 at 7:30 p.m. at the Ray Stark Family Theater, located in the School of Cinematic Arts complex. The keynote speaker for the event is Haifaa Al Mansour, Saudi Arabia’s first female director (known for WADJDA, 2012), and the night will conclude in a mixer where festival participants can network.

Georgetown University’s President John J. DeGioia announced on Sept. 1 that the university developed a plan to atone for its historical participation in the slave trade. This plan includes revising the university’s approach to admissions to offer preferential treatment to descendants of the 272 slaves the university sold in 1838. Preferential treatment favoring the descendants of slaves will roughly equal the “boost” children and grandchildren of alumni receive, DeGioia claimed. The announcement has received wide attention in the wake of a report by The New York Times earlier this year, which detailed how the university survived financial hardship through participation in the slave trade exceeding that of any other elite education institution.
Georgetown’s plan ultimately divides itself from the traditional model of affirmative action, not through offering the utopic, ill-defined goal to establish a “diverse campus,” but by emphasizing the modern relevance of the past, and recognizing the role of minority students’ ancestries in their opportunities and academic careers as students. Additionally, through the admissions plan, the university directly and transparently assumes responsibility for past wrongdoings, bringing the history of African Americans back into the modern dialogue where it belongs. 
In spite of this new approach, its overarching roots in racial justice render it vulnerable to the common arguments against affirmative action, a controversial issue in the wake of the Supreme Court’s June ruling favoring the University of Texas, Austin in Fisher v. University of Texas at Austin. The decision upheld the right of universities to be conscious of race in admissions in order to foster diverse campuses. Relevant to Georgetown’s admissions plan, the holistic nature of college admissions is worth noting amid exaggerated accusations of “reverse racism.” Race is, after all, one of many factors ranging from academics, leadership and relevant extracurricular roles to students’ world experiences and backgrounds which admissions officers take into consideration. For example, admissions officers might note pervasive research revealing how students of color are more likely to face discrimination and harsher disciplinary action than white students, as early as elementary school. 
Affirmative action is most often argued against through portraying it as “reverse racism,” but others also misleadingly present it as a detriment to minority students: Some claim that students of color admitted into prestigious schools will not be able to graduate. Alternatively, others argue race-based admissions’ potentially diverse effects on Asian-American students. This can sometimes be the case, but race cannot be understood as a disproportionately decisive factor in the admissions process.
Race-based admissions are advocated for progressives, but progressives have their own criticisms of the traditional model of affirmative action. It has important, positive intentions, but in terms of implementation, it is flawed in failing to set clear goals. The quintessential goal of affirmative action is often stated as the promotion of diverse campuses and yet, more often numbers rather than diverse communities are the actual result. Even amid statistically inclusive surroundings, students of similar backgrounds tend to naturally pool together into segregated, homogeneous communities, limiting authentic cultural exchange, which is crucial to higher education and preparation for the “real world.” Cultural exchange, after all, is not necessarily a consequence of creating a proportionally varied campus and in this sense, the goal of affirmative action is flawed in its lack of a clear definition of what constitutes a diverse campus, and what students should retain from this.
This is what makes Georgetown’s approach to race in admissions such a unique precedent, as it neatly executes a very clear goal of acknowledging, understanding, and taking responsibility for a crucial chapter in history that must never be forgotten. Cultural understandings and portrayals of slavery, segregation, the racist implications of the American criminal justice and mass incarceration systems and ongoing discrimination as ancient history create the illusion that these consequential societal constructs bear no effect on the opportunities of today’s black students versus those of today’s white students, whose families were never subjected to racial disenfranchisement. The extent to which historical racism has affected modern African-American communities was recently examined by the United Nations Working Group of Experts on People of African Descent in February, as it called for modern “reparations” in the form of investment into African-American communities affected by poverty.
Where traditional models of affirmative action emphasize proportionally diverse campuses, Georgetown sets a bold precedent by reminding a nation of the importance and relevance of its past to today’s students of color and, in that same vein, of the importance of taking responsibility for that past.
Imposing today’s “values” on behaviors reflecting prevailing standards more than 150 years ago is insane.   One aspect of immaturity is dwelling on trial matters.  The GT president is immature in the extreme.

An underground economy of cheating and “professional” writing is at your fingertips — at the price of academic integrity and guilt, of course. As higher education continues to add stress to students looking for academic perfection, an industry of high-level cheating is on the rise, allowing students to pay hundreds to thousands of dollars in exchange for customized essays, homework solutions or online-exam testing. While academic fraud has long existed in the scholastic milieu, businesses are using the student desperation for a diploma as a tactic to slowly grow a cheating economy. 
This type of work puts heavy emphasis on “contract cheating.” Contract cheating operates by allowing students to complete academic work as if they had created the work themselves, by paying dues to a third party, who then produces the work for the student. Even more so, the industry has expanded to include taking an entire class for the client. Thus, it is imperative that universities and faculty implement new strategies to motivate students to learn intrinsically — that is, learning as a purpose and reason. By developing an intrinsic love for learning, cheating incidences are projected to decrease. 
Students give into the temptation of the artificial production of their “work” by paying an outside party to complete their tasks so that they can score higher, pass the class and thus beat the system. Whether it be a custom-written essay, problems solved for a physics homework set or taking an online exam, contract cheating is slowly making its way to be accessible at the hand of all students — including USC students.
The cheating culture in the U.S. education system has existed for centuries. However, more recently business have been exploiting student desire for academic perfection by providing services for students that promote educational malfeasance. While this is so, we must also realize that student cheating is due to the campus climate — that is, the hypercompetitive culture of American universities that propel students to opt into higher levels of cheating. As competition for graduate and professional school admission increases, the incidences of cheating (via platforms such as AffordablePapers.com, All Answers, and PrestoExperts) skyrocket. PrestoExperts, for example, is a technology company that specializes in counseling services in health, technology, finance and law. The website, launched in 2014, has thousands of independent freelancers who are able to provide to-go counseling and educational help in a variety of subjects. Not surprisingly, a portion of users on PrestoExperts are college students utilizing the service to engage in academic fraud. The idea behind these platforms is so that those who have questions can link up with those who have answers. According to the creators of these services, marketplaces that promote the exchange of information is a recipe for efficiency. 
Yet, efficiency that operates an on-demand model that propels academic dishonesty provides an unfair advantage for students who produce authentic work, rather than paying a third party to complete their work. To understand why students opt into these services, we must recognize the large amount of strain placed upon students to perform well academically. In response to academic stress, students often give into the temptation to buy their grades. Ultimately, these temptations brew into acts of crime — and too often, no punishment. 
While it is clear that the new cheating economy poses a threat to the experience of learning, it is not so clear who is to blame — our dishonest, unmotivated students or the increasingly competitive nature of American universities. Both should be held equally accountable, as they both contribute to the expansion of a cheating economy. Unmotivated students need to garner a stronger passion for intrinsic learning, while academic institutions need classes that promote academic wellness.

Have you ever wondered what it’s like to be in a kaleidoscope? Last Saturday, Tame Impala delivered a performance that I would assume closely parallels just that. 
The sold out Greek Theatre in Berkeley was filled with Tame Impala enthusiasts and Kevin Parker memes. Vivacious and alive, me and my crutches felt the vibrations throughout the amphitheatre and my torn ACL. It wouldn’t have been the same without Unknown Mortal Orchestra, who started the night off with song, “From the Sun.” Setting the tone for the night, lead singer Ruban Nielson scaled 40 feet up the light tower while singing “Stage or Screen.”
Loud, crowded, yet in a way, feeling at home, I was surrounded by 9,000 other people who were all here to experience the psychedelic Australian band. As one, we were joined together under the influence of Tame Impala, ready for the inspiration Kevin Parker had to give. To add to the vibe, tech and sound guys in white lab coats came out and set up. It was time, and one by one, members of Tame Impala began walking out.
Whitney Levine | Daily Trojan
Despite being on painkillers (while drinking a few sips of alcohol here and there), Parker succeeded in making this the best performance I’ve seen given by Tame Impala. He was personable and outgoing, however, I felt like it would’ve been more interactive had fellow members also participated in engaging the audience, rather than remaining quiet. Nonetheless,  the stage performance overall was exceptional with Kevin Parker’s unorthodox background visuals. It was like he was playing a mind game on us while simultaneously performing. 
Tame Impala succeeded in visualizing our inner thoughts, while playing an 18-long setlist full of insecurity and vulnerability demonstrated through Parker’s delicate yet strong voice. Tame Impala’s setlist for the night featured a variety of tunes ranging from all three of their studio albums, also including Mark Ronson’s “Daffodils.” Upon hearing a brief intro of “Nangs,” the night really took off with “Let It Happen,” with not a single person sitting. Tame Impala is basically a psychedelic second coming of Jesus if I’m being perfectly honest.
Whitney Levine | Daily Trojan
It felt surreal being there witnessing this band that has made such a great impact on many people’s lives, and it felt surreal being there with great friends who shared the same passion for this band with me. The sound Tame Impala gives us listeners a sense of belonging. While a lot of his earlier music focused on the isolation of being human, finding one’s identity and unrequited love, the transition to third album, Currents, gives us a sense of comfort in that it’s really easy to tell the confidence in Kevin Parker and Tame Impala. I felt this was a clear parallel at the show, as the performance in its entirety projected confidence and strength, in most all aspects.
