The Undergraduate Student Government presidential and vice presidential tickets debated their platform points on important campus issues Monday night in the Campus Center, preceding the first day of elections Tuesday.
The tickets, the first consisting of Program Board Finance Director Edwin Saucedo and USG Director of University Affairs Austin Dunn and the second of Senatorial Aide Charlie Henriquez and Residential Student Government Vice President of Programming Cole Pham, were asked questions by Dan Schnur, director of the Jesse M. Unruh Institute of Politics and Neha Wadekar, a graduate student pursuing her master’s in journalism.
Following their opening remarks and a brief moment of silence in memory of a student that had passed away earlier that night, the panelists asked the presidential candidates about sexual assault on campus.
Henriquez advocated for the hiring of a sexual assault examiner on campus to oversee cases of sexual violence.
“Our ticket, something that we’re really advocating is the hiring of a sexual assault examiner,” Henriquez said. “This is somebody who is trained to see these cases and make sure everything is being taken care of medically and legally. If we can bring someone like this to campus, I think this is something that can actually help the USC community overall from all places.”
When Wadekar noted how all four candidates are men, Saucedo stressed the importance of student input to help shape sexual assault policies.
“I can’t live through the experience of a woman on campus, I can’t put myself in their own shoes, but what I can do is inform myself as much as possible,” Saucedo said. “Another one of my platform points is to invite student leaders from student advocate groups.”
In the next segment of the debate, the vice presidential candidates took turns questioning the opposing presidential candidate. Then the candidates for vice president fielded questions from the moderators themselves.
When asked about the potential of a fall break, Pham, who is from Louisiana, spoke of the importance of extending Thanksgiving break to give students — especially those from out of state — more time to spend with their families.
“Simply because for students traveling across country such as me, it’s much easier to stay home for the extra four days because two days is [the] only instructional time that is off,” Pham said.
Dunn instead advocated for a separate fall break, in lieu of an extended Thanksgiving break, in order to give students more time off to benefit their mental health.
“The purpose of [a fall break] would be to give students a creative time for stress relief as opposed to an additional partying time or time to be with their families,” Dunn said. “As great as that is, that’s not what the institution is looking to do.”
The debate then shifted back to the presidential candidates, where the question was raised about how the presidential hopefuls would stand up for students without alienating administrators. Saucedo said that it was important to cooperate with administrators and consider their point of view.
“There will be times where we have to reach compromise, but that compromise shouldn’t have to be at the expense of the student body,” Saucedo said.
Henriquez emphasized that the administration should serve students.
“The administration is nothing without the students. The administration is here for students, just like USG should be,” Henriquez said.
After a second round of questioning and a rapid-fire question round, the candidates delivered their closing statements.
Saucedo-Dunn closed the debate by saying that they want to represent the entire student body.
“This campaign is about something bigger than just us two. We really want to understand different issues that every single student on campus experiences, and that’s something we want to continue going into the upcoming school year,” Saucedo said.
Henriquez-Pham spoke about how honored they were to be given the opportunity to represent the Trojan family.
“I would like to express for USC and my love for this new home I’ve found from coming from so far away, and I really just hope through our platform I can give that love and feeling of home to others at USC,” Pham said.
The event ended with several brief presentations by potential USG senate candidates. Voting will take place from Feb. 9-11 in Hahn Plaza.

A USC student was found dead in Founders Apartments, located on the corner of Portland Street and West Adams Boulevard Monday.
The Los Angeles Fire Department initially responded  at 2:45 p.m. to the report of a non-responsive person, later declared dead at the scene.
According to Captain Andy Neiman, commanding officer of Los Angeles Police Department Media Relations, there was no evidence of struggle or foul play.
The deceased has been confirmed as a student from out of state, but age and gender have not been confirmed. Neiman could not confirm who initially found the body.
Authorities are in the process of contacting the deceased’s family. Affected students will be provided with access to mental health care and will also be able to temporarily relocate to other housing locations.
The Los Angeles County Department of Medical Examiner-Coroner, has yet to determine the cause of death.

A delegation of Keck healthcare workers, National Union of Healthcare Workers representatives and USC students presented a letter addressed to the University President C. L. Max Nikias on Feb. 8, informing him that 900 members of the NUHW will conduct a strike at Keck School of Medicine of USC, in addition to requesting his help in bringing the protracted contract negotiations between Keck and the NUHW workers to a close.
The delegation gathered outside the Bovard Administration Building and then proceeded to Nikias’ office, whereupon they were halted outside the building and directed to the Senior Vice President for Administration Todd R. Dickey’s office to deliver the letter. The letter was left in the care of the front desk secretary. When the delegation asked to speak with someone from the administration, they were told that there was no one available and that somebody would get back to them in the future.
The letter was signed by a number of community members and interest groups, including the Coalition Resistance LA, the Student Coalition Against Labor Exploitation and a number of reverends and rabbis from surrounding religious institutions. It mentioned fair compensation for work and the role of USC in providing an adequate standard of living for its employees and spur “economic development, enhance family stability,and address income inequality.”
“We are not asking for much. We are just asking for the same benefits that anybody working for USC has,” said Keck healthcare worker Herbert Palacios.
Nine hundred NUHW workers plan to strike Feb. 10 at Keck.
“With respect to the work stoppage by Keck employees, we can emphatically say that our organization continues to offer competitive benefits packages that attract top talent” Keck said in a statement regarding the strike Feb. 10.

Irina Bokova, director-general of the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization, came to USC Monday to discuss the organization’s role in using education to counter violent extremism. The Q&A was moderated by Stephen D. Smith, executive director of the USC Shoah Foundation and the UNESCO chair on genocide education.
The idea for UNESCO formed in 1942 during World War II when leaders met to discuss how the world should be rebuilt after the war and how to prevent further wars. For 70 years, UNESCO has aimed to improve the world through education, science and culture.
“UNESCO is the United Nations organization that promotes cooperation in education, sciences, culture and communication,” Bokova said. “Since war started, it’s in the minds of men, and now we say women also, of course, that the defenses of peace should be built. It’s so topical nowadays [to] see extremism and violence, [but we] see once again how strong the soft power of sciences, of culture, of heritage, of education [are] in order to make this world peaceful.”
Bokova further talked about how important it was to focus on goals on smaller scales in addition to global problems.
“One of our biggest roles, in effect, is to transform societies,” Bokova said. “But in order to transform a society, it is not enough just to declare a commitment to a universal value. It is extremely important, but [we also] see what [the] local arguments and tools [are] and how to push the buttons.”
One of UNESCO’s primary duties is to identify sites of cultural importance for future preservation. One of their primary concerns right now is the destruction of cultural sites by ISIS, and they want to ensure that sites, such as Palmyra in Syria, are preserved.
“One of the most important contributions that UNESCO has brought to the world is the concept of common heritage of humanity,” Bokova said. “The basic criteria is outstanding universal value. The convention was adopted in 1972 and now we have more than one thousand sites. I think this is an extraordinarily revolutionary concept for the time. We see now in Syria and Iraq heritage like Palmyra [and others] which testify to how humanity evolved, how cultures permeated each other.”
Bokova used the ancient monument Palmyra to give the audience an idea about why violent extremists, particularly ISIS, destroy historical landmarks.
“I think they destroy precisely because history delegitimizes them,” Bokova said. “History shows that there are different cultures, and all of them contributed to the wisdom of humanity. Palmyra is one of those monuments that has in its beauty and its engravings a little bit of the Greco-Roman culture, a little bit of influence of the Christian culture, of the Mogul culture. It is really one of those monuments that shows that humanity is diverse, and this is precisely the diversity of humanity that they want to destroy.”
UNESCO wants to work with young people to educate them about this extremism.
“[We want to] try to change the narrative of the history because maintaining this diversity is important and engaging young people, who sometimes fall prey to these extremists with radicalization, to show that there is another history, there is another narrative. The truth about history is different from what these extremists want to impose on the world,” Bokova said.
For Bokova, changing this narrative begins with education.
“The importance of equitable, inclusive and quality education and lifelong learning for all,” Bokova said. “We believe, without it, we cannot have a sustainable development of profiteer education or tackling some of the issues of youth and jobs. The new concept is about global citizenship education.”
Bokova believes education is the starting point to ending violent extremism.
“This is why we think that this youth radicalization and extremism does not have a place,” Bakova said. “Of course I know that only education maybe is not only panacea, but it is important. This is how we open these young minds to a different story.”
Eric Roth, a master lecturer in the Dornsife College of Letters, Arts and Sciences, asked Bokova why education is UNESCO’s primary tool to combat extremism and why there is so much violent extremism today despite all of our modern resources.
“The biggest challenge is to bring the global to the local, to make this bridge between the global and the local,” Bakova said. “In most of our programs and activities, this is how we translate our universal values or quest for human rights or tolerance to a local context so that it works.”

The Department of Public Safety changed security staff providers for the campus perimeter from Staff Pro to Contemporary Services Corporation on Monday, making CSC the sole security personnel company used by DPS.
CSC employees will now serve as ambassadors at fixed off-campus locations, gate check-in locations from 9 p.m. to 6 a.m. and at several busy on-campus areas during the evening, such as Doheny Library, Leavey Library and Tutor Campus Center.
The change from Staff Pro to CSC was brought about by input from the USC community as well as internal logistical needs within DPS.
“Based on the feedback we’ve gotten from students and our officers, we feel that it is probably better to have one company oversee all the ambassador positions,” DPS Deputy Chief David Carlisle said. “We feel that CSC is the better fit for USC.”
The new CSC hires will be stationed at campus entrances that are open after 9 p.m., greeting students and other guests while monitoring the flow of people in and out of campus.
Prior to last semester, CSC was the only provider of security staff for DPS. However, once CSC’s contract expired, Staff Pro made a very competitive bid for the gate posts and secured the contract for last semester. Carlisle maintains that this was “strictly a business decision, and had nothing to do with CSC’s services.”
Originally meant to create a greater sense of continuity for on-campus security — since Staff Pro already provides personnel at student dorms — DPS has decided to end its experiment with Staff Pro and make the change to CSC once more, this time for the long haul. Both companies made similar bids, and CSC’s culture seems to mesh more seamlessly with that of DPS’s own officers and personnel, Carlisle said.
In addition, it is easier for DPS administrative officials to coordinate with a single company’s supervisors, streamlining day-to-day communications and operations.
USC Housing will continue to use Staff Pro for checking students and their guests into dorms, and other departments may choose to contract with Staff Pro separately.
The change to CSC for perimeter security was partly inspired by feedback from students, some of whom were dissatisfied with the quality of service provided by Staff Pro.
“There were many times when I noticed that Staff Pro employees were on their phones or tablets. They were listening to music or had their earphones on. How are they supposed to monitor their surroundings if they are preoccupied with their phones or watching movies?” Cheryl Hagan, a freshman majoring in criminal justice, said in an email to the Daily Trojan.
This is in contrast to the exceptional service she said she received from CSC’s gate personnel.
“The staff that CSC hires seem very friendly and take pride in their work,” Hagan said. “They are always vigilant and proactive to ensure that we and our campus are safe.”

Each year in Professor Clark Hansen’s Writing 340 class, Hansen poses a question to his students.
Last semester, Hansen gave his 40-odd students the option of working on a semester-long case study he usually assigns or the chance to complete a more difficult case study that held the promise of winning a $1 million prize. The class is part of the writing requirement for the Marshall School of Business, and hundreds of students take the course any given semester.
In the Fall 2015 semester, three students took Hansen up on his offer, putting their hats in the ring to compete in the Hult Prize Foundation’s case competition that is taking place in five world cities. Next month, those three students will be flying to Shanghai, China to pitch their sustainable city idea. They are one of 50 teams selected to attend the regional finals for the Hult case competition.
The three-student team is made up of Ricardo Galvez, a senior majoring in international relations and global business, Matyou Kohanbash, a senior majoring in policy, planning and development and Phuong Nguyen, a senior majoring in policy, planning and development.
“Because it was a required class, I went along with what I had to do,” Nguyen said. “But when given the opportunity to do more, it was like a real chance to make a difference in people’s lives.”
The question posed to the team was: “How can you build a business that will double the income of 10 million people and address urban crowding?”
Since 2009, the Hult Prize Foundation has been posing global crisis questions to university students. Last year, another USC group was selected to attend the regional finals, according to a Jan. 22, 2015 Daily Trojan article. This year, the winning team will be presented their prize by former U.S. President Bill Clinton.
Case competitions are usually associated with business students. Yet, what makes this year’s team from USC unique is that none of the team members are in Marshall. In addition, all of the team members are first-generation college students from immigrant families. Galvez’ family is from Mexico, and he is the first generation from his family born in the U.S. Kohanbash arrived to America with his family from Iran. Nguyen emigrated from Vietnam when she was four.
The three team members said their origins have allowed them to approach the question through a diverse lens. The team said they wanted to go to Shanghai to pitch their idea because it was culturally different from the areas the three of them were from.
“Our diverse backgrounds really allowed us to have a broad outlook on poverty and suffering in the world,” Nguyen said. “I think that’s why the three of us gravitated toward this project because we want to make a difference on the world in a broad way.”
Their idea is still under wraps and will not be revealed until they pitch it in front of the panel of judges in Shanghai.  Yet, the team said this process has revealed many of their personal strengths previously unknown to them. Before getting the news that he and his team had made it to the next round, Galvez said he felt overwhelmed by the talent present in the USC student body and wondered how he would differentiate himself.
“This is my opportunity for me to reassure myself to not ever underestimate myself because you never know what could happen as long as you go the extra mile,” Galvez said.
Kohanbash echoed Galvez’ sentiments.
“You feel like you’re representing your friends and all your past,” Kohanbash said. “You get a chance to prove yourself, your work ethic and your idea as something more than just an idea.”
The team leaves for the case competition on March 8. The two-day competition begins on March 11.

While the thrill of reclaiming the coveted Victory Bell hasn’t quite worn off, USC’s athletic programs now look forward to recovering another prize from their crosstown rivals: the BMW Crosstown Cup.
The Crosstown Cup may be less familiar than the Victory Bell to the casual fan, and not just because of the recent name change. When current Trojans were growing up, the year-long athletic competition between the rival programs was called the Lexus Gauntlet. When Lexus’ sponsorship ended in 2009, the competition went without a commercially-branded title until 2014, when it was handed off to another luxury car brand: the BMW dealers of Southern California.
Business partnerships aside, the Crosstown Cup’s true importance rests on results, whether on the field, in the pool or on the court. In a rivalry this tense, bragging rights are usually a sufficient prize. Still, the Cup gives each school’s athletic program something to fight for: the Cup is a tangible symbol of intangible dominance. Tera Novy, a senior thrower for the track and field team, knows just how important it is to run the city.
“Winning the Cup would mean that all the athletes’ hard work paid off,” Novy said. “It supports the notion that we are the better school in L.A.”
The USC-UCLA rivalry has always been unique: nowhere else in the nation do two programs compete as fiercely as the Trojans and the Bruins compete for the right to call a city their own. Sure, Ohio State and Michigan may be able to claim that they have the most brutal football rivalry, and Duke and North Carolina may be fierce competitors in basketball. Even so, it’s difficult to find a rivalry as important as the one shared between USC and UCLA because of geographic and championship implications.
The Buckeyes and Wolverines are separated by a state line, a great lake and 185 miles of highway. The Trojans and Bruins are separated by one freeway, “The 10,” as students of both schools call it — to the disdain of our out-of-area rivals. And, while the Blue Devils and Tar Heels stand just about as far from each other as USC stands from Westwood, the level of competition in every sport except for basketball just isn’t quite the same in that rivalry. The Bruins and Trojans hold the most and third-most NCAA championship titles across all sports, respectively, and those totals are increasing nearly every season.
“The USC-UCLA rivalry is unlike any in college athletics, with two universities of such academic prestige and athletic tradition sharing the same city,” USC Athletic Director Pat Haden said on the official Crosstown Cup website. “No matter the sport, whenever the Trojans compete against the Bruins, it is an intense battle.”
Note USC’s precedence in Haden’s description of the rivalry: even the placement of words carries weight in the battle for the City of Angels.
The crosstown rivalry dates back to the 1920s, but the official competition began during the 2001-2002 school year. It would be an understatement to say the first competition lived up to expectations: the schools’ athletic programs tied under the Lexus Gauntlet scoring system, and USC was awarded the victory in a tiebreaker because it had the edge in head-to-head matchups.
And what could they possibly do for an encore? The Trojans and Bruins tied yet again in the second year of the competition; this time, UCLA came out on top with more postseason head-to-head wins. The Gauntlet was passed back and forth across the 10 Freeway for six consecutive years, until USC went on the competition’s longest winning streak, taking the trophy for five years in a row until UCLA re-claimed it in 2013. Since then, the trophy has changed hands once per year, until it came to rest in its current home in Westwood at the end of the 2014-2015 season.
Once again, competition is tight to earn the Cup. After last week’s men’s basketball victory over the Bruins at a sold-out Galen Center, USC leads UCLA by 5 points under the official Crosstown Cup rules: each school earns 10 points for winning more head-to-head matchups against the other. In the event the schools tie, each program is awarded 5 points. Because of this scoring system, the standings are fluid and not always intuitive. For example, when UCLA beat USC to win the men’s water polo national championship back in December, there was no change in the standings; since UCLA already had the edge in head-to-head matchups, winning the national championship carried no more weight than any other victory.
Should UCLA and USC end up tied at the end of the season, there are three ways the tie can be broken. In the event of a tie, the trophy will be given to the university with the most head-to-head wins. If the result is still tied, the Cup goes to the university with the most head-to-head wins in the postseason. If neither of those criteria can determine a clear winner, the university that wins the most Pac-12 championships in sports where both universities field a team would be crowned the victor at the end of a nail-biting year.
In this type of nasty rivalry, it doesn’t take a tied final result to elicit excitement as the year in sports reaches its final leg. With only 75 of the 190 total points claimed in this year’s Crosstown Cup, there is a long road ahead before either school reaches the 100 points necessary to bring home the trophy. With the conclusion of last Thursday’s basketball game, the schools will match up 17 more times across 12 different sports before the end of the school year.
In the midst of the season, it’s tempting to think that the rivalry exists only in the here and now. It’s easy to forget that, as these games are being played,  the future of each program rests, in a way, on the outcome of each crosstown matchup. Many potential recruits who are being considered for one school are also considering the school down the freeway, and what better way to help make their decision easier than trouncing the competition in a head-to-head matchup?
“Winning the Crosstown Cup allows us to show everyone that this is our city,” redshirt senior swimmer Lucy Worrall said. “Both schools are at a similar standard academically and athletically … it helps when we are recruiting athletes who are also looking at UCLA.”
Worrall and company will take on the Bruins’ women’s swimming team this Friday in Westwood for the next installment of this year’s Cup slate. While the Trojans hold a slight edge so far this season, history and reason suggest that the current five-point lead will not be enough to run away with the trophy. Winning back the Victory Bell in the fall was a good start, but Trojans and Angelenos everywhere will have to wait another three months to see if USC has truly returned to ownership over the City of Angels.

The clash of metal echoes through the gymnasium of the Physical Education Building as sparring partners focus their attention on the sword in their hand and the opponent across from them.
The fencing club at USC is hard at work, late at night, in order to teach and prepare the many fencers that come through the program. Not only do beginning fencers learn all of the ins and outs of the sport, but eventually, they can work their way up to national rankings as many of the more experienced fencers have done.
The fencing club was founded at USC in 1926. Originally the group was solely a team for males. One of the initial members was Douglas Fairbanks, who was  a founding member of the School of Cinematic Arts.
Since its inception, the group has grown to the point today where there is a core group of about 25 members coming on a regular basis, an impressive turnout for fencing.
“It’s a lot considering a team is capped at four people,” senior president Christophe Pellissier said.
The team welcomes new members every semester and begins to train with them, teaching fundamentals before inexperienced fencers ever get their hands on a weapon.
“Most members of our club have no experience fencing when they join,” Pellissier said. “We spend the first couple weeks of every semester teaching them the basics, proper movement, proper form and everything before we even let them hold a weapon.”
The new and returning members alike are taught by two coaches that the fencing team hired over a decade ago: Derek Cotton and Scott Frank. Cotton serves on the Fencing Officials Commission.
Once a fencer is ready for their first weapon, it will likely be a foil. Foil is the most common fencing weapon and the one that most fencers begin with. With a foil, each fencer can only score with the tip of the weapon as opposed to and part of the blade. The target area in a foil is restricted to the torso, and even if both fencers strike the other, only one person will get the point based on the offensive and defensive moves that were taken.
The other two types of fencing for more experienced fencers are saber and épée. In saber, the target area is the waist and above, including the head and arms. Unlike foil, the fencer may earn a point for contact with any part of the weapon, not just the tip. In épée, the fencer earns a point by making contact with any part of the body using only the tip of the weapon.
In a typical practice for the club, there is a balance of group work and skill work based on the specific weapon.
“We all stretch and warm up and do drills together,” Pellissier said. “Warm up drills probably take an hour to an hour and a half, at which point we transition to free fencing where we divide up by weapon.”
The group isn’t just training for fun. The team is part of the Intercollegiate Fencing Conference of Southern California, where USC is a very competitive member. Last year the men’s épée team placed sixth in the league and the men’s foil team came away with second. In league play, three fencers from each school face each other individually and compete in a round-robin format with the first team to five of nine victories being deemed the winner. The league season runs from October to late February.
During the month of February, the USC team also hosts a national tournament in honor of alumnus Fred Linkmeyer. Linkmeyer was a three-time national champion who graduated from USC in 1931. The tournament is sanctioned by the United States Fencing Association, meaning fencers can earn their national rankings by competing in the tournament.
All of this preparation goes toward the collegiate fencing national championships held annually in April. This is another tournament that USC has fared well in over the years. Last year, the USC men’s team placed eighth nationally out of the 42 teams that were competing. The men’s foil team also placed second overall with one foil placing first individually.
This year the Trojans are hoping to be just as successful as the women’s side of the club continues to grow.
“Men’s épée is our most competitive team so far,” Pellissier said. “We’ve been building up our women’s teams a lot this year. We have a very competitive women’s épée team and our women’s saber team is also getting more competitive.”
The team is split roughly half-and-half into male and female demographics according to Pellissier.
In the months leading up to April, the team has high hopes for how they will finish the season.
“We’re planning on having a much stronger showing at nationals this year and trying to get a few fencers to place individually,” Pellissier said.
For Pellissier and students across USC, fencing provides an athletic experience unlike anything else. Members of the club include graduate students and even a few faculty members. For undergraduate students though, nearly the whole range of USC schools is represented in the membership and creates a unique team-building atmosphere to compete in along with a chance to get away from everyday anxiety.
“It’s really relaxing to be able to just go work out and stab people,” Pellissier said, referring only to the scoring system of fencing. “It’s a really cathartic sport in that regard but really intense mentally. It’s a way to get away from the normal stress of school.”

Point totals can be deceiving.
USC sophomore star guard Jordan McLaughlin put up just nine points against UCLA at the Galen Center last Thursday, but his command of the floor is improving with every game.
In that win over the crosstown rivals — to complete the regular season sweep — McLaughlin continued to look like one of the best at his position in the entire country. He helped USC to its 18th win of the season, an 80-61 rout of the Bruins.
McLaughlin’s impressive play has naturally been a major talking point for any USC fans who like to make comparisons. The sophomore is right up there with the best of the best, including Maryland’s Melo Trimble and Indiana’s Yogi Ferrell.
Trimble is consistently lighting it up for the Terps, as he has guided his team to 21 wins by early February. Trimble’s game has few foibles and his vision on the floor is stunning. The silky smooth sophomore has drawn comparisons to Steph Curry. Trimble excels in pick-and-roll situations and is lethal when he attacks the basket, able to dish it off to a big man at the rim.
Likewise, Ferrell — a senior leader on a talented Hoosier team — has been one of the most exciting players in all of college basketball this season. Ferrell is unselfish. His passing is exquisite and his work rate is never to be questioned. Ferrell led IU on a 25-0 run to end the first half at Michigan last week, looking borderline unstoppable in the process.
McLaughlin missed time last season due to injury, but he has stayed healthy in the 2015-2016 campaign. He has already logged over 700 minutes of game action, playing just over 31 minutes per game. The one-two punch of McLaughlin and junior guard Julian Jacobs has been an absolute handful for USC’s opponents this season.
McLaughlin is shooting better than 45 percent from the field and is nearly hitting 42 percent of his shots from beyond the arc. His three-ball has been big for USC this season, but it will be massive for him moving forward.
In order to be one of the most feared guards in the NBA, developing a jump shot is essential. Rajon Rondo, Jeff Teague and Kemba Walker are all pro guards who refined their jumpers to take their game to the next level. McLaughlin has nailed 40 3-pointers this season, one less than Maryland’s Trimble and 12 less than Indiana’s Ferrell. The veteran Ferrell has seen his deep ball improve from roughly 30 percent during his freshman year to almost 46 percent during his senior year. McLaughlin is only a sophomore and is enjoying similar success from downtown.
McLaughlin’s game is incredibly well-rounded and his skill in pick-and-roll situations is evident. He effortlessly spreads the ball around and always seems to find the open man.
With the resurgence of Trojan basketball as a whole, there has unsurprisingly been a return of USC players garnering national attention. For a program that has produced the likes of Taj Gibson, DeMar DeRozan and Nick Young, the rise of McLaughlin has been a welcome sight for the faithful.

The USC men’s basketball team returned to the rankings Monday in both the AP Top 25 and the USA Today Coaches Poll. The Trojans are the No. 23 team in both rankings.
The Men of Troy are coming off a big 80-61 win at home over UCLA last Thursday to finish 3-0 on their recent three-game homestand. They defeated Washington State on Jan. 28 and Washington on Jan. 30 at the Galen Center.
USC had been unranked the last two weeks since leaping into the AP Top 25 three weeks ago. Coming after a three-game win streak in which the Trojans defeated Arizona in four overtimes and UCLA on the road, it was the their first appearance in the Top 25 since 2008.
But they relinquished their spot following back-to-back losses in Oregon to the Ducks and Beavers on Jan. 21 and Jan. 24, respectively.
Currently sitting 23rd in the nation, the Trojans are ahead of Texas and Wichita State in both the AP Top 25 and USA Today Coaches Poll. Their inclusion gives the Pac-12 three representatives in the polls, as the Trojans join No. 11 Oregon and No. 17 Arizona.
This time, the Trojans will look to remain ranked in the Top 25 for longer than a week. They take on Arizona State on Friday and No. 17 Arizona Sunday on the road, both of whom they beat at home earlier in the season.
USC enters Friday’s game with an 18-5 overall record and a 7-3 clip in conference play, good enough for second in the Pac-12 behind Oregon. On Monday, USA Today predicted the Trojans to enter the NCAA Tournament as a No. 4 seed. Eight conference games remain on the schedule for the Men of Troy.

While it is a university’s job to cultivate good citizens as much as it is to produce graduates with high levels of human capital, some of USC’s past and present character-building attempts have been wasteful and unintentionally regressive. On Jan. 27, the Department of American Studies and Ethnicity hosted an open forum to discuss the progress that university standards have made in producing socially and fiscally conscious community members. Many of the panelists questioned the removal of the diversity general education requirement which was replaced by a broader canon of core literacy classes, echoing some student complaints that by not having a separate requirement for “diverse” studies, the university is complicit in perpetuating an “unsafe” campus climate. However, this logic could not be further from the truth.
The diversity general education requirement, as well as the differentiation of Western versus global studies, incubated a sense of otherness entirely counterintuitive to its intentions. The old GE requirements divided its cultural studies into the GE I, Western Cultures and Traditions, and GE II, Global Cultures and Traditions. By dividing our cultural studies into Western, “Global” and “diverse,” the University was normalizing Western, or implicitly, white culture, while stratifying and objectifying the history and humanities of all other cis, heteronormative, white writers and thinkers.
Furthermore, the existence of the diversity GE in conjunction with the apparently growing number of GEs in general bears a significant cost on low-income students, who simply cannot afford to spend dozens of units of tuition on classes which have no economic value to them. While removing the diversity GE was a step in the right direction, the new GE standards as a whole entailed two steps back, as now there are eight required categories plus a general education seminar, whereas there were previously six required categories, not including the diversity GE.
Going forward, if USC really wishes to create a tolerant campus environment which promotes a multitude of viewpoints and voices, it should condense the GE program for the sake of practicality and converge Western, global and diverse culture into one study of the humanities: human culture.
Few people today really fit into the boxes for which these lines were originally drawn. When intersectionality comes into play — looking at different aspects of people’s identities, such as gender, race, sexuality, etc. — nearly everyone now is “diverse,” so why reimplement a separate but equal standard for historically marginalized groups, when we could instead just integrate them into our studies? There is no reason why Toni Morrison should not be studied next to Walt Whitman or Henry James. And even if you instinctively want to separate them on the basis of Whitman and James being a part of the “dead white man” canon, recall that Whitman himself was homosexual, and although his writings may not explicate feelings of oppression, there remains an inherent intersectionality in them.
USC should drastically cut down its GE program to three courses, one of which should be a quantitative course, another analytic and the third a humanities course. By making a single humanities requirement, USC can gradually remove the sense of social stratification that marginalized cultures may feel in being neglected from main history and literature classes. Instead, we may create a campus climate which celebrates us all under a single humanities course.

Last semester saw significant changes to the university general education curriculum — most notably, its removal of the diversity requirement. Whereas students who began college before Fall 2015 were responsible for satisfying six general education categories, including a course focused on diversity, new core standards eliminated the diversity requirement and replaced it with two additional categories entitled “Citizenship in the Global Era” and “Traditions and Historical Foundations.”
Some have lauded the change as a positive step in improving the general education system, but the removal of the diversity requirement threatens to have serious repercussions for the university’s academic culture.
In a diversity forum hosted by the Department of American Studies and Ethnicity in January, students, professors and administrators discussed the impact these new general education requirements would have on students’ curriculum and the campus community going forward. Though some panelists explained that the diversity requirement was not exactly removed but merely expanded in scope, ASE Associate Professor Shana Redmond raised the important point that without the intentional usage of the word “diversity,” its distinctive academic importance risked being lost within the rest of the general education curriculum.
Though there is nothing wrong with providing a wider global scope to every student’s undergraduate education, diluting the diversity requirement within the broader label of “global perspectives” fails to highlight the importance of having the requirement in the first place. The diversity requirement was implemented for the very purpose of providing students with the knowledge and analytical skills necessary to understand and respect diversity. In a university that boasts of so many different fields of academic study, such a goal is difficult to achieve without instituting some sort of requirement that is geared toward all students, regardless of their college or their area of study.
While it is certainly true that diversity should be as deeply embedded in all aspects of academic life as possible, instituting a diversity requirement is the only way to ensure that all students  study issues related to racial, ethnic, gender, socioeconomic, sexual orientation or religious diversity in ways that may not have necessarily been offered to them otherwise. By mandating that students enroll in at least one course geared toward these types of diversity that exist both on campus and in society at large, the University can ensure that this important part of every student’s liberal arts education is satisfied.
Last semester’s campus-wide conversations surrounding the Undergraduate Student Government’s Campus Climate Resolution is a testament to the fact that students care about instilling a university culture that respects and promotes diversity. But these conversations shouldn’t be left to weekly senate meetings and campus forums. If the University hopes to prepare students for responsible and thoughtful citizenship in our increasingly pluralistic and diverse world, then it must do more to ensure that diversity remains a fundamental cornerstone of a USC education.
Reimplementing the diversity requirement for all undergraduates is the best and most efficient way to do that.

On last week’s episode of Real Time with Bill Maher, legendary feminist activist Gloria Steinem claimed that Hillary Clinton is losing support among young women, because “when you’re young, you’re thinking, ‘Where are the boys?’ The boys are with Bernie.” She also asserted that men become more conservative when they age, while women become more radical, apparently explaining why 63 percent of women over the age of 45 support Clinton over Sanders, according to NBC News. Although she has now issued an apology, Steinem’s original statements reflect a pervasive view among women over 30, Madeleine Albright included, that young women are bad feminists if they don’t support Clinton. And even taking into account her rapidly backpedaling Facebook post in which Steinem says that young women are actually “activist and feminist,” Steinem still fails to consider what Hillary’s lack of support among young women really means — the feminist movement has evolved.
Steinem was right about one thing: Hillary Clinton has lost the youth vote. In Iowa, Bernie Sanders won 84 percent of voters under 30. This cannot be attributed to the condescending assertion that young women are trying to please men or the unsupported claim that younger women are just not as radical. Rather, Clinton’s lack of support among women under 30 marks a very important shift in the feminist movement. Young feminists are simply not interested in identity politics.
Identity politics is the idea that political beliefs or movements are formed around a person’s identity — their race, gender, class or other identities. While this can create important networks of support for people from similar backgrounds, it has one serious drawback — people cannot be boiled down to one aspect of their identity. This problem was toxic for the second wave feminist movement, which often ignored other aspects of women’s identities, such as their race or sexuality or class. Second-wave politics may partially explain Gloria Steinem’s statement.
Steinem was a crucial figure in the feminist movement of the ’70s. But her comments about the 2016 election serve only to illustrate just how far the feminist movement has come since then. While she may believe that there is something inherently radical about a female president, younger feminists aren’t buying it.
A female president is no longer equated with a feminist victory in the minds of women under 30. This does not mean young women are less radical or less likely to be feminists. In fact, it points to a more comprehensive, more inclusive view of politics and progress. After the second wave, feminism means something more than supporting women. It means supporting LGBT women. It means supporting undocumented women, poor women and women of color. It means tackling the roots of oppression that not only cause misogyny, but also cause ableism, racism and transphobia.
So, when Hillary Clinton claims to be a feminist, younger feminists look to her record rather than her gender. And when women under 30 find that she was against gay marriage until 2013, voted for the Iraq War and has a Super PAC largely supported by Wall Street, these factors outweigh her self-proclaimed feminist label.
All of this is not to say Hillary Clinton has not faced sexist attacks while running against Bernie Sanders. Any comments about her “shrill” voice or her appearance are surely misogynistic and point to a culture that is still uncomfortable with powerful, women leaders. But dismissing Clinton’s lack of youth support as sexism or ignorance only prevents an important discussion about the role of identity in politics.
Kimberlé Crenshaw coined the term “intersectionality” in 1989. Riki Anne Wilchins wrote the essay “Why Identity Politics Really, Really Sucks” in 1997. Feminism has changed — and mostly for the better. Gloria Steinem can continue to ignore the revolution that feminist politics has undergone in the last 30 years, or she can attempt to genuinely recognize that young women are concerned with something beyond the gender of their president — they’re concerned with ending discrimination and oppression in all of its forms.
 
Feminism IS Identity politics. When you see everything through a lens of class structure you are a Marxist. Period. Millenials need to read about the Redstockings, Steinem and her CIA connections and stop parroting the tenets of a movement that is more cult than anything else.
Millennial feminsts are also part of the problem. When will feminists quit being so infantile and comprehend that the battle has already been won in the United States and nations like it? It is time to grow up and move on. This constant propaganda of telling us that we are opposed when we aren’t is not healthy and does a great disservice to the issue of human rights . And whether feminists like it or not, the reality is that we are the most privilidged group of women on the planet.

To say Ryan Reynolds has had a rough time playing roles in tights and capes is an understatement — he was in a terrible attempt of bringing the Green Lantern to the screen, he was the Hannibal King in the more than rough-around-the-edges Blade: Trinity and in X-Men Origins: Wolverine — a film that anyone would have trouble finding at least one good thing to say about. His first time playing the character Deadpool was so grossly distorted, it was unrecognizable. However, Reynolds is getting a second shot at the character, and it looks promising.
In Marvel’s latest release of Deadpool, Reynolds plays the Merc with a Mouth, also known as Deadpool. For those who are unsure who this character is, the best way to describe him is a raunchy, hilarious, charismatic and straight-up bizarre mercenary who treats the fourth wall like it was never there to begin with. He’s not a hero, but he’s not a villain either; he simply does what he wants.
Deadpool is about Wade Wilson, who develops near-inoperable cancer and goes through a risky operation that gives him superhuman healing powers. The treatment cures him, but his new benefactors have ulterior, evil motives that include turning him into a slave, and the treatment leaves his entire body scarred and disfigured and turns his mind unstable. In order to exact revenge on the people who left him debatably worse for wear, he develops an alter ego named Deadpool: a masked vigilante who is lethal, nearly indestructible and simply refuses to shut his mouth.
Deadpool is an efficient killing machine and leaves a trail of bodies wherever he goes … right before making a crude set of jokes to lighten the mood. This will likely be the strength of the movie, as it will do what X-Men Origins: Wolverine failed to do with the character — let him talk. It seems like common sense to let a character whose nickname is “the Merc with a Mouth” to actually open his mouth and let viewers see why he’s earned the nickname, and thankfully, Marvel realizes this. Reynolds is a funny guy, and it seems like the movie is going to let him simply do his thing on screen, which will be a treat for the audience. He’s waited a long time to make this movie, and he plans on making the character something moviegoers won’t forget anytime soon.
This movie is also a treat for comic book fans who can’t get enough of Deadpool, since the movie has the potential to create  a faithful representation straight from the comics. With the last showing of the character, however, this isn’t saying much, as it’s hard to go anywhere but up from rock bottom. If the trailers prove anything, this character dismantles the fourth wall, is weird but lovable and can be a mercilessly effective killing machine without taking anything seriously. In other words, this is copy and pasted right from the comic books, which is great news for longtime fans and newcomers alike.
The only potential drawback to this movie is that it could be trying too hard to wash their hands clean of the previous portrayal of the character. If it hasn’t been made clear by now, the last time Deadpool was on a screen was horrifically awful. The trailers alone will make someone laugh, but nobody likes a movie that panders to the crowd for cheap laughs. It’s easy to see that the character is meant to be funny, but the danger here is trying too hard to prove their point. This is unlikely, as Reynolds would have easily dropped the project and waited on a better attempt before making another inaccurate and just plain bad attempt at playing the character.
Deadpool is shaping up to be the contender for the funniest movie that Marvel has made to date. Marvel has proven that they can make movies alternative to the superhero genre with the sleeper hit Guardians of the Galaxy, and Deadpool looks to be like the next alternative movie that moviegoers who are sick of the stereotypical superhero movie will want to see. Anyone tiredsick of the capes and do-gooders who want to see a funny, action-packed movie with a very out-there character will want to see Deadpool this Friday. To quote the man himself, “This is a different kind of superhero story.”

If you’ve spent any amount of time in New York City, you have no doubt seen food carts selling halal on what seems like every street corner in Manhattan. In the city, the food stands are as integral as the city’s MetroCards. One of the better-known sellers, The Halal Guys, branched out to franchise beyond the East Coast and have opened a restaurant in Long Beach in an attempt to bring a taste of Manhattan to the West Coast.
The success of the original Halal Guys cart encouraged the owners to open two sit-down restaurants in New York city and then multiple locations worldwide. The first Southern California location opened in Costa Mesa. The second location opened in Long Beach earlier this year. For those who balk at the idea of trekking to Long Beach, The Halal Guys’ website states they will soon open a location in Koreatown. Growing from a small food cart to brick and mortar restaurants in various countries is no easy feat; however, it is no surprise to anyone that has enjoyed The Halal Guys.
Currently, the Long Beach restaurant is the closest to USC. Nestled between a Wingstop and a Chipotle, the restaurant holds its own in the vast shopping center. Although it’s only been open for a few weeks, word has definitely gotten around as there are hardly any empty tables and the line can extend to the door on weekends — though this might be attributed to the small size of the restaurant. There are only two main items on the menu: platters or pita bread sandwiches. The protein choices include chicken, gyro or falafel — falafel is the only vegetarian option while the gyro is beef. There are also sides and baklava for dessert. The food is prepared in an assembly line in front of the customer.
The platters come in large or small sizes and come with rice, pieces of pita bread, lettuce and tomato. The small size is by no means a puny serving and is extremely satisfying.  The chicken platter is a safe bet for the first timer who is wary of trying a new restaurant; the most popular combination is chicken and gyro. The chicken is served over rice with no odd seasoning or artisanal twist. The chicken and rice are genuinely good but nothing special. It is almost unbelievable that something so simple can create such an impressive cult following.
The secret is probably the white sauce. The white sauce and the hot sauce are added as toppings as the last step in the assembly line. This hot sauce truly is “hot” and even someone who has an affinity for spicy foods should take caution. However, the white sauce is nothing short of addicting. It’s definitely difficult to pinpoint the taste of it; it’s not rich or extremely flavorful, yet it seems to enhance the flavors of the entire platter. It is not uncommon to hear patrons ask for more white sauce or for some on the side. Thankfully, The Halal Guys has packets of the sauce to take home, for a surcharge. The white sauce is a must-try for every customer.
For around $10, customers can have an extremely satisfying meal in Long Beach. There are no frills in the restaurant and it does not have any “hipster” touches so prevalent in modern eateries. It is worth the commute from USC. If not for the food itself, then it is the perfect chance to jump on the bandwagon and see what everyone is raving about. The opening of The Halal Guys in Southern California gives Californians a taste of New York in a welcoming environment. It is the first New York City transplant opening this restaurant. There is no better way to wait for Shake Shack to open in West Hollywood than to hop on the Metro blue line and have some halal in Long Beach.
 
Puke!

Last Thursday evening, approaching midnight, I was pacing back and forth in my apartment. I was listening to a 1971 recording of Richard Strauss’ Der Rosenkavalier played by the Wiener Philharmoniker, conducted by Leonard Bernstein and starring Christa Ludwig and Gwyneth Jones. This recording, a jewel that I found very recently at a secondhand shop in Los Feliz, is one that I soon found myself listening to over and over again. The richness and complexity of Strauss’ late-Romantic orchestrations provided a pleasant distraction from my current predicament; it was also on this night that I decided to break things off with Roland.
“Hey, we need to talk. Can you call me?” I wrote.
Roland is a guy — rather, the guy — whom I have been casually dating since last August; the same guy that doesn’t seem to want any emotional intimacy beyond the casualness of our already informal encounters. And for a while, I didn’t necessarily mind this uninterested demeanor because I was also uncertain of what  I wanted as well. However, after the fourth month of dating, I began to notice his adamant resistance against taking our relationship to the next level. It seemed that for every step I was trying to take forward, he was taking two steps back  from me.
It’s been about six months since Roland and I first started seeing each other, and it wasn’t until about two weeks ago that I realized how much he was holding me back. For one, he has been so emotionally unavailable that I began to wonder how seriously he even took our relationship. He also held me back from allowing myself to explore more intimate relationships with other people. Though there was nothing preventing me from seeing other guys — which I did, from time to time — I still felt the need to stick around with Roland, mostly because I just didn’t want to be alone.
To be frank, the sole reason I didn’t end things with Roland sooner was because subconsciously, I would rather have what I had with Roland than to have nothing at all. I am always the one who advocates for self-love and independence outside of a romantic relationship, and I realized I wasn’t following my own advice. But if there is one thing I know about human nature, it’s that seldom do we practice what we preach. Once my subconscious began to surface, I knew it was time to pull the plug.
After I sent that text, Roland called me almost right away. I’m not sure exactly what he thought we were going to discuss, but he seemed surprised when I told him I thought we should part ways. I explained that it was  clear we’re both looking for something different, and there wasn’t really any point to continue what we had going on if there wasn’t going to be some sort of rewarding future between us. He said he was disappointed but also understood. Things ended civilly with no feelings hurt, and we agreed that there would be no hard feelings between us. Things would be well.
I’m not going to lie — I did take some sort of pride in being the heartbreaker versus the heartbroken, as it was a situation that I was not accustomed to. Usually, I’m the one who is broken up with and left wailing in my room with Wagner’s “Liebestod” from Tristan und Isolde playing on loop. But following the breakup, I didn’t waste my time wallowing or feeling sad over the situation.
Though I wouldn’t call what Roland and I shared to have been especially rewarding, I wouldn’t call it a waste either; though I definitely prolonged my decision to end things sooner, the situation as a whole allowed me not to resent my own loneliness. This time around, I don’t necessarily feel the overwhelming pain of heartbreak but rather a sense of freedom to dictate the course of my own relationships and not compromise my own happiness to avoid solitude. And if there is one thing I’ve taken away from Der Rosenkavalier,  it is far better to bow out gracefully than to continue unhappily.

Elizabeth Gu | Daily Trojan
Relationships are hard. That’s an easy lesson to learn. What makes a relationship worth all of the labor that goes into building it? That’s a much more difficult question to answer.
I didn’t have an answer to that question when I came to college. In high school, I was always guarded. I kept my emotions extremely close to the vest. When I came to USC, that mindset didn’t change. I was dating more, but I hadn’t found anyone worth keeping around for particularly long. 
During my freshman and sophomore year, it was easy to remain detached, so it took me falling flat on my face for someone that I was crazy about to realize that I needed to change. It wasn’t hard for me to be interested. We had a startling amount in common. Similar personalities, backgrounds, likes, dislikes, she almost seemed like my female counterpart. After going out a few times, she left me feeling completely entranced.
But even though I was enamored with this girl, I could never feel completely comfortable with where I stood. For every great date or conversation we would have, there would be broken plans or a missed text to counter it. While the highs of our relationship would feel euphoric, the lows were soul extinguishing. The rapid oscillations between the two would regularly consume my thoughts and leave me confused, frustrated and exhausted.
I realize now that I spent far too long trying to figure out what we were on my own because I was too scared to ask her what she thought about what was going on or what we were. Months passed, summer came and went, and I still didn’t have a clear answer. Eventually it got to a point where I couldn’t wrap my head around what was happening anymore, and I finally had no choice but to ask her how she felt.
We talked that night for what felt like an eternity, but I finally started to see the full picture. To put it in the most blasé of terms, we wanted different things. I finally wanted a standard relationship with someone that I liked and felt like I could rely on. We had both had our fair share of crazy relationships and hookups in the past, but I liked her enough to be willing to put all of that in the rearview mirror for something more stable.
Suffice it to say, she didn’t feel the same way. She still wanted to have “experiences,” to take advantage of what USC could do for her. Being in a serious relationship wasn’t a part of that plan. I couldn’t blame her for that. After all, everyone wants to come out of college feeling like they got more than just a diploma and a desire to evade their loan officer at all costs. The college experience is singular and the adventures that can happen at a place like USC rarely happen in a person’s life again.
But what I didn’t understand was why she thought being in a relationship would somehow take away her freedom to have those experiences. I was crushed. That I couldn’t make it work with someone that I was so clearly compatible with made me feel like a failure, and I couldn’t help but feel like it was my fault that things didn’t work out.
We didn’t really talk after that night. We would run into each other on occasion, talk briefly and part amicably. I didn’t mind these encounters too much. Even though there wasn’t anyone new in my life, I was having great semester without her and always had something to do or somewhere else to be. I thought that meant that I was over things.
Right before the semester ended though, we decided to take a break from the madness of our lives and catch up for a bit. I told myself it wasn’t a big deal. It was just coffee after all. Plus, it would be nice to talk to her again. But within 15 minutes of being out with her again for the first time in months, she nonchalantly mentioned her plans to study abroad the following semester.
I felt absolved when I first heard it. Her exiting my life for a foreign land would finally put an end to the run-ins at parties, the “he said she said” between mutual friends, and allow me to finally move on to greener pastures. But after talking and swapping stories late into the night with her again I had a startling realization. Despite the lows that our relationship put me through, I had missed her, and it made me sad knowing that after that night was over it was going to be a very long time before I would get the chance to talk to her again.
The struggle of romance in college is just that, it’s college. People are going to disappear from your life. That can be for the summer, a semester abroad or even forever after graduation. The more you care about these people, the harder it is to say goodbye, if you’re lucky enough to even get the chance. Some could interpret that as cynicism, but I don’t really see it that way. Caring about someone is beautiful, and it’s always better to have had those people in your life than to push them away out of fear that they’ll leave you.
I think Daniel Jones, the editor of The New York Times “Modern Love” column that actually inspired Love U, said it best: “People work really hard trying to game out how they can avoid heartbreak or pain or unpleasantness, thinking life is best without those things. Others, meanwhile, seem to approach life with an eager curiosity, wanting to experience it all, good or bad. Bring it on, they say, whatever ‘it’ may be. Those are the happy ones.”

“I have a friend who keeps wanting to hang out. He’s really awesome, but I fear he likes me more than platonically. How do I non-awkwardly, non-confrontationally, non-friendship-destroyingly relay the message that I am uninterested in a more-than-friends relationship but still really would like to be homies?!?!”
Making yourself a little less available is a generally effective way to curb any thoughts that you might be into him, and hopefully he takes the hint. Don’t go out of your way to confront him about his suspected feelings — lest you come off as presumptuous — but definitely be straightforward about your disinterest if he makes a move or says something. Attempting to protect him from the truth with ambiguity will ultimately be more hurtful than the temporary discomfort of making it clear that this is a closed door. An old adage to guide you through the aftermath: It’s not weird unless you make it weird.
