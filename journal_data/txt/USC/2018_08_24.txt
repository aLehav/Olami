Since 1972, the Student Academy Awards has recognized directors like Spike Lee, Robert Zemeckis and John Lasseter before they went on to have successful film careers. Now five USC students announced as finalists for the award may join their ranks.
The Student Academy is a program created by the Academy of Motion Pictures, Arts and Sciences to award innovative student filmmakers for achievement in documentary, animation, alternative and narrative film. The application is free, making it accessible to talent from diverse backgrounds.
Alumna Kelley Kali Chatman made a narrative film called “Lalo’s House,” which examines child sex trafficking on the island of Haiti.
“The cool thing about the Student Academy Awards is that there’s three slots,” Chatman said. “You can win gold, silver or bronze, but nonetheless you’ve won a Student Academy Award. It’s just remarkable.”
Chatman initially came to Haiti to study children’s rights and living conditions as part of her anthropology background. After the 2010 earthquake, she returned to help with relief efforts.
“I caught wind of a Catholic orphanage where the nun was allegedly putting 11- and 12-year-old girls out for prostitution, allowing men to come in and sleep with them for money,” Chatman said. 
The discovery prompted eight years of research and film, during which she returned to Haiti periodically.
“What I came to find out was the nun wasn’t officially ordained by anyone,” Chatman said. “There’s a lot of organizations in Haiti and around the world that pose as benevolent organizations to put on a front and allow for sex trafficking to happen to children.” 
Chatman’s project didn’t fully take off until after she was accepted into USC. Submitting the trailer in her application, she found the support and funding to realize her vision and get others on board as well.
“They saw my passion,” Chatman said. “They saw that I was backed up by USC and they said, ‘Okay, we have got your back. We’re going to make this movie with you.’”
As a Student Academy finalist, she’s grateful for the support she’s received. In turn, she wants audiences to see her film and realize the extent of trafficking in their own communities.
“I’m writing from a place of experience, but I want it to be known that this isn’t just a Haitian issue, it’s a world issue,” Chatman said. “We all need to wake up and see the signs and learn what the signs are and start to protect our children better.” 
Mahaliyah Ayla O’s narrative film “Masks” focuses on mass shootings. As a survivor of a mass shooting at five-years-old and a queer woman, O felt a connection to the Pulse nightclub shooting in 2016.  
“One day I was in my room, and the story just came to me in a flash ad I just had to get it out, so I wrote it down,” O said. “Initially, it wasn’t like ‘Oh yeah, I want to make a film, and I want to do this and that.’ It wasn’t really a conscious process.” 
The idea didn’t surface into a film until she was asked to rework her master’s thesis after the professor she worked under left in the middle of the semester due to an emergency.
“I shared that story with [my advisor] that I’d written just alone in my room, not intending to share with anyone, and she thought it had potential,” O said. “She encouraged me to start developing it.” 
O hopes “Masks” will create further conversation around gun control law and teach people to treat each other with kindness during their limited time on earth.
“Overall the message I hope for them to leave with is to love each other,” O said. “While we’re here, think love first. That’s the most important thing.” 
Graduate student Yiying “Nikki” Li’s documentary “Love & Loss” follows two disabled women on their journey to find love and connection. Li immigrated to America when she was 17 years old and befriended a woman with a brain tumor. After she passed away seven years ago, she felt compelled to share her friend’s experience.
“She always told me how she was very lonely,” Li said. “[It] made me want to do something that can shine a light on disabled people or people who have terminal illness that also want to look for love [and] also try the best to live out their life.” 
To create her film, Li spent a year building relationships with the two women whose stories she wanted to tell. Afterward, Li pitched the idea to her Advanced Documentary 547 class.
“I was lucky that my film was selected from seven other documentaries at the time,” Li said. “We got funded by the school and got to use the equipment and all the facilities from school.”
After the screening on May 4 this year, Li had a quick turnaround to make the June 1 deadline. Even though her professors encouraged her to submit her piece, she was shocked to even make the semi-finals.
“Student Academy is so legitimate … it’s so prestigious.” Li said. “All the best film schools in the world … submit it. I did not think I would get it.” 
With the only animation film of the USC finalists,  alumna Yu Yu wanted to explore what people are willing to do for loved ones who have passed on in her piece “Daisy.”
“Even when people know the loved ones [are] no longer there, the search for them still never ends,” Yu said.
Using stop motion, Yu animated the entire film from her apartment.
“I like to explore characters pursuing their desires, yet in a disturbing manner,” Yu said. “There is nothing wrong with wanting something, but it is important how people go about achieving it.” 
No matter who wins on Oct. 11, the finalists gain exposure and networking opportunities through their nominations.
“I’ve not focused on competition,” O said. “I feel really grateful that we’re getting opportunities to be shown, whether that be a small audience [or] large audience — and obviously the Student Academy Awards has a huge platform.”

The new student veteran housing building is located on 32nd Street and can house up to 10 veterans. (Emily Smith | Daily Trojan)
Last spring, Brandon Wexler would wake to the sound of his alarm blaring at 5 a.m. every morning, after sleeping only three hours the night before. He’d pull on a T-shirt and a pair of jeans and shuffle out the door to walk his dog before his morning commute to USC. 
Wexler would then stumble into his vehicle, still rubbing the sleepiness out of his eyes. Fighting the endless red lights and cars’ wheels that seemed to be glued to the streets, he’d pull up to USC just in time to scramble into his 8 a.m. lecture.
Unlike the majority of undergraduate students, Wexler, a student veteran and senior majoring in cognitive psychology, did not live near campus. He lived 20 miles away in San Pedro.
This year is different, though. Now he only has to walk 10 minutes to get to campus. Along with seven others, Wexler is living in a new complex near campus reserved specifically for student veterans, many of whom face the constant struggle of commuting to campus on a daily basis, hailing from as far as Bakersfield, Oceanside and even Desert Hot Springs.
“Because we’re older, many of us have families and so maybe you buy a home somewhere and your family is there,” Wexler said. “And of course, your spouse has their business there or they’re working there and your kids are in school there. You can’t just uproot them and take them and move them to USC.”
Wexler, who is the president of USC Veterans Association, is the resident advisor for the new student housing, which is tucked along 32nd Street across from the Shrine Parking Structure. The complex is home to both a single-story and a two-story house with 10 bedrooms and six bathrooms rented to any student veteran, regardless of gender or class. Veterans pay $1,075 a month to live there.
“Being on campus like this — it’s hard to put into words how much less stressful and less strenuous it is,” said junior Evan Hagen, a student veteran who also used to commute from San Pedro. “Career fairs, all kind of professional development opportunities, the ability to partake in clubs really closely — [commuting] really detracted from the full experience of actually being here. Sometimes it almost felt like treating it like community college.”
As the complex turns into home, the veterans hope to use it as a way to further assimilate themselves into USC by hosting get-togethers so that the rest of the student community can get to know them. They also want the housing complex to become a way to keep their own community deeply connected. The student veteran population at USC consists of around 800 people.
“For all the veterans that are going to be able to partake in that, we’re all going to be able to support each other be there for each other if we need it and clear our minds together and figure stuff out if we need to,” Hagen said.
Though many of the veterans taking advantage of the new housing are single, those with families can still live there as long as their dependents don’t permanently live with them. Some are using the housing to cut their commute during the week and are planning to either visit or receive visits from family on the weekends, Wexler said.
Many of the veterans that have typically stayed near campus throughout the years have done so on their own, but have found themselves in a different situation than most USC students since they enrolled in college after serving in the military.
“It’s a little awkward being in your thirties and having had a 20-year military career and then moving into the Lorenzo where you have to share a bedroom with somebody,” said Wexler, who recalled a situation where a male graduate student veteran was assigned to room with two 19-year-old women.
The idea to create the veteran student housing came up last year and was developed by the USC Veterans Association and the University. As the plan developed, those working on the project looked into accommodating the veterans’ Monthly Housing Allowance into USC Housing’s payment calendar, which normally expects students to pay each semester in full, according to Kris Klinger, assistant vice president of USC Hospitality and Radisson Hotel. They also focused on making 12-month housing assignments available to the veterans rather than the typical eight-to-nine month assignments for which students are typically housed at the University.
Though the veterans have only been living in the housing since Aug. 15, those involved with its creation are already thinking about the future.
“Our goal is to see how we can continue to evolve,” Klinger said. “The veteran community here at USC is fairly strong and supportive through different groups and entities. The possibilities are unlimited. It’s just what’s next and looking for those opportunities and now all our eyes are open to that and what can we do next.”

Mark Schoofs, a Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist, will use his experience to strengthen the investigative journalism program. (Photo from USC Annenberg News)
On Tuesday, the Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism announced that that Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist Mark Schoofs will be leading the school’s investigative journalism program. 
“I think the best thing about [Schoofs] is not only that he knows how to write and how to produce stories across platforms that are important today, but he’s used to working with an array of young journalists,” Gordon Stables, the director of journalism at Annenberg, said of the school’s newest hire. “For students, the chance to get to work with one who has tremendous experience in teaching younger journalists on how to do this work in a way based on industry standards is a wonderful opportunity.”
Before joining USC, Schoofs worked at BuzzFeed News, where he established and led its investigative team in 2013. He also served as an editor for ProPublica and was an investigative reporter for The Wall Street Journal.
“It’s a career of 30 years and understanding deeply, how to do investigative reporting so that you get the documents, the interviews and the facts that are necessary, then have it written or presented in a way that hits,” Schoofs said. 
During his time at BuzzFeed News, Schoofs and his team of reporters covered an array of investigations. For example, reporter Katie Baker discovered sexual harassment complaints from over 180 people regarding the nationwide Massage Envy spa. Although the company initially made no efforts to address the issues, they eventually announced changes to instruct franchisees to handle sexual assault allegations after the investigation was released. 
The team is also known for investigating the alleged wire transfers involving President Donald Trump and Russia, with offshore companies linked to his former campaign chairman Paul Manafort. They eventually uncovered that the FBI was scrutinizing the Russian Foreign Ministry for having over 60 international money transfers. 
“What BuzzFeed in particular has taught me is how to use the digital world to make stories explode,” Schoofs said. “BuzzFeed is probably the most sophisticated digital media company in the world. Seeing, watching and thinking about how people interact with great investigations that are only presented digitally is incredibly useful.”
Schoofs hopes all of his past experiences will inform his teaching and his philosophy for the investigative reporting program at Annenberg.
“[It’s important for students to focus on investigative journalism] because that’s ultimately the journalism that can make the most difference in the world,” Schoofs said. “You uncover wrongs that are so fiercely kept secret, that it requires a huge investment of time and resources to expose them. So that kind of journalism is essential, it’s the core of all journalism.”
Stables said Schoofs’ first responsibility with the University’s faculty will be to evaluate and develop different ways that the school can expand investigative reporting in its curriculum and extracurriculars. 
“I hope that [students] learn and take from his passion to tell important stories in a thoughtful way,” Stables said. “I hope that they [the students] can share his passion and his energy to help guide their vision and their stories.You don’t always get to see someone at the peak of being a professional and of the influence they have to want to come and want to be apart of a university environment. We’re just really fortunate.”

Hosted by radio veteran Ian Chillag, “Everything is Alive” is a new sort of fiction drama: Each inanimate object is played by an actor, who improvises a conversation with Chillag in the studio. (Photo courtesy of Radiotopia)
The era of true crime podcasts is over. In an attempt to replicate the success of hits like “Serial” and “S-Town,” audio storytellers have been mass-producing true crime podcasts. Consequently, the true crime genre has lost its novelty across media platforms, and its satirization has been notably evident in both Netflix’s 2017 series “American Vandal” and The Onion’s first-ever podcast “A Very Fatal Murder.”
So instead of listening to yet another true crime podcast, try “Everything is Alive.”
The show is part of the podcast medium that’s slowly taking over. It’s a type of audio storytelling that’s been around since the birth of radio — serialized fictional audio dramas. Think about the possibilities: We can tell stories in the wildest of fantasy worlds without needing exorbitant special effects or movie magic. 
There are some amazing bastions of audio-fiction that are already well-established podcasts, such as “Welcome to Night Vale,” the absurdist dark humor series, and “The Truth,” a podcast that brings short fiction to life with cinematic production featuring amazing voice acting and perfectly choreographed sound effects and music. 
“Everything is Alive” is now joining the ranks. The conceit of the podcast is exactly as advertised — it asks listeners to exist in a world where the most mundane inanimate objects live full lives. 
The podcast is produced by audio veteran Ian Chillag for Radiotopia.   Chillag has worked on shows like the Peabody Award-winning “Wait Wait Don’t Tell Me” and Terry Gross’ “Fresh Air.”
His first foray into fictional audio is just as brilliant as those shows. The beauty of “Everything is Alive” lies in its simplicity. It’s set up as an interview show, where Chillag talks to an inanimate object — in the first episode, he interviewed a can of cola. And in the most recent episode, he interviewed a pillow. 
Each inanimate object is played by an actor, usually a comedian, who engages in a completely improvised conversation with Chillag. The semi-longform interviews are delightfully intimate, revealing simple truths about objects we take for granted in everyday life. They illuminate details about the innumerable systems and processes that allow the object to exist in the first place.
Giving such simple objects an identity through voice forces listeners to develop a greater appreciation for the objects, especially since the items being interviewed are entirely unremarkable — they’re not rare gems or complex inventions. And the concept, that basic idea that everything is alive, allows for imaginative storytelling that’ll keep you captivated from start to finish. 
But the podcast will stay with listeners for much longer than the length of each episode. There’s something slightly melancholic about the way Chillag conducts the interviews, and how his guest objects respond. Each episode is marked by philosophical discussions that we rarely articulate or think deeply about. For example, Chillag asks the can of cola what it feels like to have someone drink out of him, launching a genuinely moving conversation about pain and death. 
Chillag and the actors bring a sincerity to the podcast that is necessary for its success, and it allows them to discuss very human emotions and values from a decidedly non-human perspective. 
At the same time, “Everything Is Alive” remains comedic. The music choices and interview questions often are an understated satire of common public radio interview stereotypes — while it isn’t the main purpose of the show, it demonstrates a certain awareness of the inherent silliness that accompanies interviewing inanimate objects. 
At first glance, this podcast seems absurd — and it is absurd, in every possible way — but it also a paints an intimate portrait of everyday objects that results in a poignant and touching commentary on what it means to be alive, and what it means to be human.

“Searching” differs from other technological thrillers in that the story is told entirely through computer screens. It does so through the use of FaceTime calls, news footage and text messages. (Photo from IMDb)
In recent years, filmmakers have started incorporating modern technology into their stories. While visuals have been delivered through computer screens in the past, directors are now trying to have their entire narratives be told strictly through  technology. This sounds like a gimmick; however, writer and director Aneesh Chaganty uses this format to his advantage in his suspenseful directorial debut “Searching.”
The story follows David Kim (John Cho) as he tries to find his missing daughter (Sara Sohn). The last major movie to use this tactic was “Unfriended,” by director Levan Gabriadze, who had most of the movie’s story play out over a Skype call. But, Chaganty innovates the ways in which this movie’s storytelling style can be progressed.
Driving Chaganty’s narrative is information relayed through FaceTime conversations, news footage or simple text messages. Telling the story using screens allows for other details that will be appealing to some viewers. Even if the film is focused on one computer, it can still convey the passage of time, as videos and pictures spanning many years will flash on screen, giving the audience a concise view of characters aging, Many clichéd moments, such as the tiresome quote, “Your mother would’ve been so proud,” don’t feel as insufferable because they happen through text conversations.
Using screens to convey information also allows for minor subplots to take place without disrupting the main storyline. At the Q&A following SCA’s exclusive screening of the film, Chaganty mentioned an eHarmony subplot where a potential match contacted Kim, and her messages changed based off what was happening in the movie. He said that he enjoyed experimenting on with other elements on the desktop as he was setting up basic pages like the Internet and FaceTime.
Aside from the cinematographic beauty, most of the film is marginally good, except for the affectionate opening scene and Torin Borrowdale’s beautiful score. Cho delivers a standout performance as David Kim. Although his character is paper-thin, he gives a believable performance through his concern and anger. 
This movie’s best element, however, is that its subtlety. Though “Searching” has not been marketed as a film about the Asian American experience, Chaganty’s careful curation of details, for instance messages that say “eomma” and “appa,” Korean translations of mom and dad, respectively, make the film representitve of Asian culture.
“[Searching] behaves as if we’re past this moment where we’re talking about representation, and there is no need to talk anymore about it because it’s normalized,” Cho said in an interview with Entertainment Weekly. “It’s an Asian American family and it’s very specifically a Korean American family, and yet that doesn’t have any bearing on the story that we’re telling.”
In many Hollywood productions, this element of diversity feels forced into the narrative, and the latter becomes secondary to this motive; it becomes diversity simply for the sake of diversity. When many Hollywood productions are praised nowadays, it’s primarily just for the inclusion of minorities. However, the best instances of on-screen representation are when it comes naturally, like in “Aliens” or “Mad Max: Fury Road.” “Searching” is a tense thriller that just so happens to star an Asian American man.
For all its decent moments, “Searching” succeeds with this element. Normalizing marginalized groups in the way that Chaganty and Cho did is vastly effective. It’s important to tell Hollywood that this movie’s biggest achievement was putting Cho in a normal role and not labeling it as “Asian-led,” because representation in media will only progress through normalization.
For those who just want a satisfactorily tense experience, this movie is worth seeing at least once. For those who care about on-screen representation, however, “Searching” is worth watching because it is so much more than a stereotypical thriller in many ways.

On Wednesday night, Queen Latifah and Common reunited at the Hollywood Bowl as a part of their “Jazz at the Bowl” series. The two previously co-starred in the 2010 romantic comedy “Just Wright.” (Matthew Philips | Daily Trojan)
Many a night during Los Angeles’ arid summers, the Hollywood Bowl comes alive, filling 17,000-plus seats with patrons hoping to catch one of their favorite performers. On Wednesday, fans had the chance to catch twice the action. As a part of the iconic venue’s “Jazz at the Bowl” series, the powerful double-headlining bill of Queen Latifah and Common provided for a night of unbridled positivity and unity.
Common first graced the stage shortly after 8 p.m., coming out with as much passion and vigor as a freshly signed artist with nothing to lose. Dressed in a blue tracksuit, Common delivered inspiring lyrics touching on heartbreak, political strife and the struggles of growing up in Chicago’s South Side. 
Over the years, the large-hearted street poet has built an empire of gospel-influenced rap backed by soulful instrumentation, and his musical ensemble reflected that. Straying from the expensive visuals and thunderous bass of many of today’s hip-hop performances, Common enlisted a live band complete with a backing vocalist and deejay. 
One of the show’s most powerful moments came at the end of “The People,” when Common condemned the mass division he felt was perpetuated by political parties, corporations and the media. He instead offered a solution to “the people” — to embrace and celebrate each other as human beings. Common suggested that if the country could accomplish this, there would be no more Michael Browns, Philandro Castilles or Sandra Blands — only peace. 
Afterwards, Common raised his fist and uttered the opening lines to “Letter to the Free.” In an effort to increase audience participation, the MC and entertainer made his way down into the Bowl’s boxes filled with wine-sipping patrons and got them on their feet. When he finished handing out high-fives, he hopped back on stage for a tribute to his mother. He recalled her words of wisdom about how the success of the individual does not equate to the success of the community, a mantra he claims to have lived by his entire career.
Common certainly saved the best performance for last. Audible gasps could be heard from the audience after his keyboardist played the first few notes of the Academy Award-winning track “Glory” from the 2014 film “Selma.” In the song, the Chicago-born MC spits empowering lyrics touching on the historical resilience and strength of black America over the centuries, and Common expertly captured the track’s heaviness live, with the audience eagerly hanging on to every last word of his verses.
The building anticipation between sets was cut immediately when Queen Latifah took the stage at 9:45 p.m., coming out to her Grammy-winning jazz record “I’m Gonna Live Till I Die.” The at times larger-than-life figure could not have been more comfortable entertaining a crowd of thousands. Armed with an understanding smile and casual demeanor, Latifah immediately put the anxious hordes of fans at ease. Her stage presence was a balancing act between an unrestrained rebel and a nurturing mother figure, similar to many roles Latifah’s held in television and film. 
At 48 years old, Latifah still has a voice that can drop jaws and fill hearts. She and her band spanned her storied career in the performance, seamlessly switching from her early hip-hop singles to soulful ballads to recreations of her solos from the musicals “Chicago” and “Hairspray.”
However, to imply that Latifah’s performance was hers alone would be dishonest, as she gave her backing band the spotlight at every opportunity she could. On several occasions, the Queen cheered from the sidelines while her trumpeter, lead guitarist and two drummers exchanged stadium-shaking solos. True to her influences from American jazz and Afro-Cuban music, Latifah added a three-piece brass section and conga player to her traditional band, both of which were among the most integral parts of her performance.
As well, Latifah allowed plenty of shine for her three backing vocalists, all of whom easily held their own with staggering emotion and range. Upon the opening notes to “I Wanna Be Down,” Latifah brought out fellow hip-hop pioneer feminist MC Lyte to trade verses and banter. Much in line with the show’s casual magistry, the pair’s chemistry was more comparable to two friends reminiscing than two artists working together. 
After the performance, Latifah explained to the audience that, on her stage, ladies come first, she will unapologetically keep it as such. The timely side commentary quickly detoured into her signature Grammy-winning anthem “Ladies First.” Afterwards, Latifah concluded the evening’s festivities with a charged performance of “U.N.I.T.Y.,” imploring her attendees to adopt the song’s unifying message in their own lives.
As a whole, the pair of performances were as riveting as they were uplifting. Both Common and Queen Latifah unequivocally encouraged their audiences to unite in their common humanity, rather than divide among racial, political and economic lines. Their music was the vehicle for this message, and those in attendance responded with laughs and hugs as they exited.

Freshman wide receiver Amon-Ra St. Brown shows off his athletic talent in practice before the season opener against UNLV. (Emily Smith | Daily Trojan)
Less than a week and a half away from their opener against UNLV, the Trojans have been rounding into game form over the last few practices. The practices this week have been noticeably more intense, with jarring hits and frequent confrontations throughout both days, and the team seems to be itching for the chance to play live football. Thursday was a slow day, as practice was closed to the media. However, head coach Clay Helton addressed the press afterward.
Mock game prep
The team has been preparing for its mock game Saturday, which Helton says it will treat as an away game. The coaches plan to run about 40 to 45 plays, many of them against a simulation of UNLV’s scheme. After the game, the coaches will begin putting together their two-deep depth chart, which will be released by Sunday. 
Don’t expect the starting quarterback to be revealed then, however; Helton made it clear that the depth charts will not give away the decision at QB1, which will be announced later. Helton has continuously maintained that the three-man race is still ongoing and that there’s no clear frontrunner, but all indications point to freshman JT Daniels being the man for the job.
St. Brown’s role
Helton further clarified the coaching staff’s plans for freshman receiver Amon-Ra St. Brown, after weeks of speculation about where he’d be lining up, with veterans redshirt sophomore Tyler Vaughns and junior Michael Pittman Jr. expected to hold down the starting spots out wide. St. Brown had been used almost exclusively as an outside receiver throughout most of camp, until yesterday when he took some reps from the slot with the first team with Vaughns and Pittman out wide. Helton explained that they plan to move St. Brown across the formation early in the season, and that he will play both in the slot and outside in different personnel combinations alongside the two veteran incumbent starters and the other receivers on the roster.
He went on to clarify that St. Brown would play in the slot from the first game, but that he’d be outside 75 percent of the time. St. Brown has had an exceptional camp — he’s been ready to play Division I football from the second he stepped on the field for training camp. It’ll be worth paying attention to how many touches the Trojans can get him in games.
Injury Update
Redshirt senior center Toa Lobendahn, sophomore left tackle Austin Jackson and junior linebacker Jordan Iosefa were held out for what Helton described as “preventative measures” in order to help take some wear and tear off their previous injuries. 
Senior right tackle Chuma Edoga has been battling a hip issue that caused him to miss a few practices last week. Although he’s been practicing, he seems to still be fighting through the injury, as Helton noted that they’d have to monitor that injury throughout the season. Redshirt junior Ykili Ross was absent from practice on Thursday after his outburst in the middle of a drill on Wednesday. Helton said Ross is taking personal time off, and that he’ll provide further updates on his situation come Monday.

Originally, I wanted to write a column expressing my dissatisfaction with how Major League Baseball markets its stars, but it’s a common feeling that’s already been written about by many sports columnists. Instead, I want to focus on the organizations that are doing their player marketing right. 
This mismarketing phenomenon has been most evident with Mike Trout, the five-tool outfielder from the Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim. Simply put, the guy is an absolute beast, and he’s just the right player to become the face of the MLB. Aside from his skills on the diamond, Trout is a stand-up guy. The 27-year-old from Millville, N.J. interacts with fans and plays the game with class — yet the MLB has failed to adequately market him.
I enjoy watching and analyzing baseball in any form and at every level — professional, semi-pro, college, you name it. But my favorite level of baseball is Little League. Even though I look forward to watching the Little League World Series every summer, I have never thought about why I enjoy watching preteens play ball until now. 
I think a lot of it is the novelty of seeing 12- and 13-year-old kids play at such a competitive level on an international stage. Little League could easily focus solely on the game itself, only showcasing the talents of these young players (ahem, MLB). Rather, the LL organization has done a fantastic job focusing on the personalities of the kids. For those who haven’t watched a Little League World Series game, each game is preceded by  a “get to know the players” segment. This allows the individual players and teams as a whole to showcase who they are; it humanizes the youth-athletes in a way that MLB hasn’t done with its players. 
The face of the LLWS this year has been Alfred Delia, better-known as “Big Al.” The 12-year-old from Middletown, N.J. let fans know what he is all about in his TV introduction. 
“Hi, my name is Alfred Delia,” he said. At home they call me ‘Big Al,’ and I hit dingers.”
Fans and the media ate this up. Within weeks of his now-famous TV appearance, Big Al had gone viral on Twitter, caught the attention of pro athletes, been featured in numerous articles and even appeared on “Jimmy Kimmel Live.” Baseball fans are clamoring for his autograph and pro players, including New York Mets third baseman Jose Bautista, are asking for photos with him.
Amazingly, Big Al is signing autographs for fans who would be indifferent about receiving a signed baseball from the majority of MLB players. That is just baffling at first glance, but it actually makes a lot of sense because he isn’t just another baseball player — he is “Big Al.”
Last year, I was standing with one of my friends in the crêpe line at the McCarthy Dining Hall and behind us was USC kicker Chase McGrath. In utter disbelief that he was standing next to the USC kicker, my friend turned and whispered to alert me of McGrath’s presence.
As humans, we are constantly searching for social connection; we look to relate with others. Professional and even collegiate athletes seem to be so far removed from society we can’t fathom that these players exist in the same world as us — much less eat at our dining halls.  Our tendency to regard athletes as supernatural beings is really a strange phenomenon. We, the media, are a bit desensitized to this as we talk to athletes on a regular basis. The average fan is shocked by just casually running into an athlete, let alone having a conversation with one.
This summer, USC Athletics has done a superb job humanizing USC football players. Several short videos have been released featuring the interests and future aspirations of the team members. I only hope that USC Athletics has the resources and time to expand this project to other sports and showcase more of the diverse, interesting athletes and coaches we have. 
My favorite stories at Daily Trojan have been profiles on athletes and coaches. I cherish the ability to show an audience that these gladiators are more than what we normally recognize them for on the field. Each athlete and coach has a personal story and it’s a shame that these stories go largely untold by the organizations that represent them.
Perhaps this disconnect dilemma is the media’s fault for not properly covering the players. However, professional and collegiate organizations have just as much as a responsibility to market their athletes as humans and not just athletes. 
With social media at the forefront of immediate communication and the ability to showcase athletes as more than a player in a game, organizations have no reason to not market their players in this way. Organizations like MLB should learn from the examples set by Little League Baseball and USC Athletics. It makes the viewing experience much more engaging and fun for fans.

Senior forward Leah Pruitt (center) celebrates by embracing her teammates after scoring a goal in the 2017 season. (Emily Smith | Daily Trojan)
After their 1-0 victory on the road against UC Irvine to start the season on Aug. 16, the Women of Troy will face off against Cal Poly for the home opener on Friday, Aug. 24 at 3 p.m. On Sunday, the Trojans will travel to Malibu for a 1 p.m. matchup against the Pepperdine Waves.
It was a hard-fought battle for the Trojans at UC Irvine, but they managed to claim the victory. UC Irvine won the Big West Conference last season, and came in ranked first in the conference during preseason. To claim this victory on the road is an impressive feat for the Women of Troy and a solid way to start the season.
“Today was a really tough battle against Irvine, they played extremely well,” head coach Keidane McAlpine said. “It’s exactly what we needed to start the year. We showed some toughness and got the goal that we needed in front of a great crowd on the road and found a way to win.”
Redshirt junior Natalie Jacobs was the key player for the Trojans against the Anteaters as she netted the only goal of the game. Jacobs recently joined the Women of Troy as a transfer student from Notre Dame, where she led her team in goals in 2017. The goal was special for Jacobs not only because it helped the team win, but also because it occurred on her birthday. 
“Actually, I prayed, before [the goal], I’m not even kidding!” Jacobs said. “And then Leah sends a perfect ball, and I kind of blacked out for a second, and then it went in.”
The goal came off of an assist from senior forward Leah Pruitt. Pruitt will play an important role for the Trojans this season, as she has already scored 10 goals and has assisted on 12 more in her career. She was a part of the 2016 team which won the national championship, and earned All Pac-12 second team honors last season.
In the team’s first game of the weekend, the Women of Troy will host Cal Poly at McAlister Field at 3 p.m. on Friday. Cal Poly, ranked eighth in the Big West preseason coaches poll, had a goalless draw against Marquette last Thursday. The Mustangs are coming off of a 7-9-3 season last year, but the Trojans have yet to beat the Mustangs in their last three matchups. 
Senior defender Chelsea Barry is a player to watch for Cal Poly in Friday’s game. The talented defender was named to the Big West Preseason All-Conference team, and will look to lead her team from the back this season. She will try to keep a clean sheet against the Women of Troy on Friday and stop players like Pruitt from creating any chances at goal.
Following the match against Cal Poly, the Trojans will face their toughest test of this young season as they travel to Pepperdine on Sunday for a 1 p.m. game. The Waves were ranked 18th in the preseason polls after winning back-to-back WCC titles and making the second round of the NCAA tournament last year. However, Pepperdine is yet to meet its potential this season, having been shut out against both Kansas and Texas Tech.
Senior Hailey Harbison is expected to lead the Waves in this game. She was named the West Coast Conference Defender of the Year last year and this season, was named to the watch list for the MAC Hermann Trophy, the most prestigious award in women’s collegiate soccer, given to the best player in the nation. 
Trojans will look to continue their strong start to the season as they aim for another deep postseason run.

Junior outside hitter and first team All-American Khalia Lanier prepares to serve an ace. (Daily Trojan file photo)
The women’s volleyball team begins its 2018 campaign in the Trojan Invitational at Galen Center on Friday with a match against the University of Kentucky. The team will also face Creighton and Northern Iowa on Saturday in the round-robin tournament. 
Ranked 10th in the AVCA national preseason coaches poll and second in the Pac-12 preseason coaches poll, the Trojans field a strong team in 2018. They are led by junior outside hitter Khalia Lanier, last season’s leader in points and kills, and senior setter Reni Meyer-Whalley, 2017’s leader in assists. Also returning are senior libero Victoria Garrick, who was first on the team in digs and third in assists, and senior middle blocker Brittany Welsh, third on the team in blocks.
The Trojans lost a true star in All-American opposite hitter Brittany Abercrombie, who was second on the team in both kills and blocks. With Abercrombie showcasing her talents with the Team USA Pan Am Cup preliminary roster instead, the Trojans will need to find a suitable replacement if they want to live up to their ranking.
USC has added five freshmen to this year’s squad. Middle blocker Abby Hansen, at 6-foot-4, is an intimidating presence with the potential to be an offensive force. Setters Ashley Humphreys, who went undefeated throughout her high school varsity career, and Raquel Lazaro, who won two Spanish National Championship gold medals, also join the fray. The newcomers are topped off with powerhouse outside hitter Brooklyn Schirmer, who comes off winning a club national championship and competing for Redondo Union High School. 
These aren’t the only new faces, however. This weekend will also mark the beginning of the Brent Crouch era. The newly minted head coach, who inherited a winless Portland team in 2014 and led them to their winningest season in 25 years by 2016, was given the top job in January. 
In addition, middle blocker Jasmine Gross transferred to USC for her junior season. Gross excelled in her two years at Pepperdine, earning All-West Coast Conference first-team honors twice and ranking fourth in the nation in blocks per set in 2017 with 1.52.
The Trojans take on fifth-ranked Kentucky in their first game of the season Friday at 7:30 p.m. The Wildcats are an aggressive and dangerous offensive team, finishing fourth in both hitting percentage and kills per set a season ago. They return their top two leaders in points in junior outside hitter Leah Edmond and sophomore outside hitter Avery Skinner.
This is a tough opponent for the Trojans to face in their opening game. Kentucky is prolific, having made it to the quarterfinals of last year’s NCAA Women’s Volleyball Championship tournament, and should only improve as its young stars mature. However, the Trojans should be able to put up at least a good fight, as they made it just as far in last season’s bracket.
USC faces Northern Iowa the following morning at 10:30 a.m. The Panthers are unranked but not to be underestimated. They boast the high-scoring hitter duo of Piper Thomas and Karlie Taylor, who combined for an incredible 1,166 points last season. They rode these two stars to the most kills per set in the nation in 2017. Northern Iowa set up Thomas and Taylor well, ranking second in assists per set a year ago.
UNI did have to replace leading server Bri Weber, however, so the Trojans should look to take advantage of any shortcomings early in plays. 
Finally, the Trojans play 13th-ranked Creighton Saturday night at 7:30 p.m. The Bluejays are another strong offensive team, albeit not as intimidating as Kentucky or UNI. They ranked 14th in hitting percentage and 18th in kills per set in 2017. 
Creighton also returns its two best scorers from last season in senior outside hitters Jaali Winters and Taryn Kloth, both of whom topped 350 kills. Liberos Brittany Witt and Samantha Bohnet, who each had at least 28 service aces and 109 assists, will be leading its defense.
This weekend is a test to see what the Trojans are made of. Their performance against two top-12 teams in the country and perhaps the best offensive team in the nation should be a good indicator of just how good USC can be this season.

Walk into any one of the seven Starbucks locations within a one-mile radius of USC’s campus and I guarantee that your go-to order has changed: Your normal iced caramel macchiato is conspicuously strawless. 
In early July, I picked up my drink at Starbucks, which had a new lid resembling the top of a sippy cup, and reveled in the amazing feeling that I was saving the planet. Kevin Johnson, president and chief executive officer of Starbucks stated: “For our partners and customers, this is a significant milestone to achieve our global aspiration of sustainable coffee, served to our customers in more sustainable ways.” It wasn’t only me who felt victorious in this feat. The Walt Disney Company, another major corporate player, has also promised to ban single-use plastic straws and stirrers by mid-2019. Some cities across the country are now considering the trendy ban; major metropolitan areas like Seattle and San Francisco have been pushing through legislation to engage in similar efforts. But banning straws is not enough.
Back in March, USC’s Environmental Student Assembly launched a petition to ban the use of plastic straws in campus dining halls. ESA’s successful campaign parallels the movement that is currently sweeping the nation. The petition, which garnered over 1,000 signatures, aimed to ensure that all waste coming from dining halls would be 100 percent compostable — a goal hindered by the use of straws.
Similar to USC’s ESA, many people all over the country look at these tangible policy outcomes as a victory in the pursuit of environmental justice — but, we have only cleared the first hurdle.
USC students are lucky that  ESA recognizes that the plastic straw ban is only the first step in creating a more sustainable environment, it’s difficult to make the same claim about corporations like Starbucks and Disney. This small act is only meant to placate the public’s concern for the environment. Urging companies to take up larger and more beneficial projects, like aiming for a zero waste product or creating more ethically sound practices, is a hard feat. 
Many critics of the straw ban movement are quick to point out that plastic straws seem like a very small piece of a much larger problem. Straws make up about 4 percent of the amount of plastic waste in the ocean, but only .03 percent of the eight million tons of waste. Straws make up such a small percentage of the plastic polluting our waters that it does not make sense to focus all of our attention specifically on it.
It seems that viewing straw bans as a glorious win for the planet and a win for corporations only distracts from the true problem. The problem with small policy changes is that they deter organizations and institutions from effecting positive and long-term change. The straw ban is merely a Band-Aid solution on a bullet hole and stalls more productive conversation.
To make an actual impact, the straw ban needs to transcend its titular focus — the straw. While the straw ban quickly gained the support and sympathy of many after a disturbing video of a sea turtle with a straw up its nose went viral, straws are not and should not be the only issue. The movement must expand its message to encompass all single-use, or disposable, plastic items. Products like water bottles, soda cans, plastic bags, stirrers, food packaging, shopping bags and many more plastics must also be included in the conversation. As global citizens and stewards of the planet, we have a moral obligation to highlight and act on some of the more pressing reasons why our oceans are dirty, our air is polluted, marine life is suffering and landfills are overflowing.
And in addition to shining a spotlight on the direct hazards of single-use plastic products, we must be educated on the entire process of their creation. Once the public realizes that fossil fuels and greenhouse gasses play a large role in the production of these items and that only a small percentage of all plastic is recycled, the movement can finally move beyond straws.
We cannot let the straw ban become more damaging to the environment than the straws themselves. A small win should not distract us from pursuing other crucial policy actions. Because once we think that the work is done, we forget about the problem.
So remember, next time you order a drink at Starbucks, skip the straw. But think about the other ways you can help save our planet.

The $270-million renovation of the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum recently reached its halfway point. Amid the ongoing construction, however, the USC football team and the Los Angeles Rams will still be playing at the venue this season. The University’s first home game is on Sept. 1 against UNLV, and though gameplay will not be affected by the renovation, the fan experience will be. With football season approaching, fans should consider taking public transportation instead of driving, and put aside their negative perceptions of public transportation. 
The construction on the Coliseum’s west side has already eliminated 1,200 parking spaces. But it doesn’t stop there. On the south side, construction on the Scholarship Club Tower means one less entry gate. In addition, fans won’t be allowed to walk through the construction zone surrounding the Coliseum.
There’s only one feasible solution to these problematic changes: public transportation, especially the Metro light rail. 
Interestingly, only about 339,000 people out of the 13 million residents in the Los Angeles metro area use the Metro light rail on an average weekday. But general ridership is decreasing every year, and one concern is safety. According to a Metro survey from 2016, almost 30 percent of riders left the system because they did not feel safe. Another concern with the Metro is that it takes much longer than driving. 
LAist columnist Matthew Tinco writes, “Why wait 30 minutes for a 20-minute bus ride when you could drive the distance in 10?”
Indeed, it can be tempting to call an Uber or Lyft when looking at the estimated time of arrival on a Metro route. For many people, however, the mental shortcut that attempts to make an immediate decision — in this case, negative perceptions of the Metro — may be to blame.
“Availability heuristic” is a term first coined in 1973 by psychologists Amos Tversky and Daniel Khaneman. It describes the human mind’s tendency to place more importance on the things that it can easily conceive, falling into the mental trap of “If you can think of it, it must be important.” They proposed that the availability heuristic occurs unconsciously and often reflects the world in a negative light. Here’s a simple example: After seeing articles about child abductions, parents often begin to believe such tragedies are far more likely than they actually are,
This so-called availability heuristic does not protect us from potential dangers but rather adds to our pre-existing paranoia. 
The biggest problem with our mental shortcut such as the aforementioned example is that certain events tend to resonate in our minds more than others. Excessive media coverage and stories about the risks of the Metro may come up and stand out in our minds — because the event is unusual, our brains place a greater significance, leading us to assume the event is much more common that it really is. 
Thus, Uber and Lyft ridership remain in good standing. People don’t take note of the reported incidents involving Uber and Lyft; they conveniently avoid the assaults, harassment and fatal accidents that Uber and Lyft drivers have been implicated in. 
The Metro is easy to use, relatively cheap and has stations that are only a short walk from the Coliseum and Galen Center, some close to L.A. hotspots like downtown Santa Monica, Pershing Square and Universal City. The system is in fact the third most comprehensive in the nation, trailing only New York City and San Francisco, which is impressive considering Los Angeles is geographically larger than those two cities combined.
Personal security shouldn’t have a price tag. The fear of feeling unsafe, however, is not a valid excuse to not take the Metro. The number of tragedies from cars and Uber or Lyft speaks for itself. In the last five years, there have been 18 alleged kidnappings, 384 alleged sexual assaults, 101 alleged assaults and 51 deaths attributed to ridesharing services, according to the Taxicab, Limousine & Paratransit Association. Compared to those numbers, the Metro, where major crimes are rare, may be safer than the ridesharing alternative.
The renovation of the Coliseum is a new opportunity to not only physically influence L.A. residents to take the Metro, but also to fight our impulsive judgment of the immediate information available to us.
