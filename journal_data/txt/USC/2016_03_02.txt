The men’s tennis team will head to La Jolla to compete in the Pacific Coast Doubles Championships beginning on Thursday.
The Trojans are coming off a 5-2 loss on the road to UCLA on Tuesday.
The tournament will kick off at 3 p.m. with the final scheduled to be played on Sunday. It is the 127th edition, making this tournament the second-oldest tennis event in the United States.
The field of participants includes top teams in the nation, including UCLA, Stanford, Cal and Rice — all ranked in the top 30. Along with top teams, top coaches and alumni will be present. Coach Peter Smith will be partnering with former Trojan great Kaes Van’t Hof, and they will face freshman Michael Plutt and junior Oliver Welsh, the third doubles from Bryant University in Rhode Island.
The Trojans currently don’t have any nationally-seeded pairs, but they have been playing constantly with the same pairs throughout the spring. The first doubles pairing will be junior captain Nick Crystal and freshman Laurens Verboven. The duo was able to upset No. 3 Mackenzie McDonald and Martin Redlicki of UCLA in their last match.
“We’re enjoying playing together,” Verboven said. “We needed some time to get to know each other well, but we play a great doubles out there. In practice, we always try to play together, making the situation as realistic as possible.”
Crystal shared his previous experience with the newcomer.
“We played the whole spring so far,” Crystal said. “Coach has done a really good job putting us together. [Verboven is] a really good doubles player, and we matched really well together.”
This tournament will allow the team to work on their doubles skills while still having the competitive stimulus.
“It’s a really fun tournament. We’re going to go practice our doubles, which we can definitely work on,” Crystal said. “We can we get some much deeper practice, rest our bodies a little and get ready for the rest of the season.”
Seeded fifth in the top half of the draw, Crystal and Verboven will face the third doubles from UC Irvine of seniors Jonathan Hammel and Tyler Pham.
The second doubles pairing will be senior Max de Vroome and freshman Jack Jaede. The pair has currently seven wins this season. They are seeded 13th in the top half of the draw and will face junior Thomas Bennett and sophomore Jamie Malik, the second doubles at Rice University.
Third doubles junior Rob Bellamy and freshmen Jake DeVine have been playing together throughout the season. They will face another unseeded pair of senior Wyatt Houghton and freshman Gunther Matta of Cal.
Junior Thibault Forget and sophomore Tanner Smith are pairing up for this tournament. They will face the 10th seed in the bottom half of the draw, represented by senior Felipe Rios and junior Max Tchoutakian from Baylor. His match will feature two French players, one on each side.
Sophomore David Laser teamed up with freshman Logan Smith and they will play freshman Kyle Butters and senior Toby Mitchell of Boise State University’s first doubles pairing.
Following the tournament, the Trojans will take on Tulsa on the road on March 12.

Fresh off of an undefeated run in 2015 that culminated with the program’s first-ever AVCA National Championship, the No. 1-ranked beach volleyball team will be in a prime position to repeat its success and win it all once again in 2016.
The upcoming season will mark the first year of beach volleyball being recognized as an official NCAA sport, in addition to becoming the first ever season of Pac-12 beach volleyball. After going 28-0 in 2015 and claiming the school’s 123rd national team title, the Women of Troy have been ranked preseason No. 1 by multiple media outlets, including the AVCA National Poll and by DiG Magazine.
While the early expectations may loom large for the Women of Troy, fifth-year head coach Anna Collier will return some firepower in 10 letterwinners from last year’s squad. USC boasts a good mix of experience and fresh faces in their line up with the top three pairs being made up of upperclassmen — five of whom are juniors — while the four and five pairs consist of a freshman, a sophomore and two former transfers.
“Interestingly enough, I actually think we have an even tighter-knit group than last year, and we’re also pretty deep,” Collier said. “I really think we’ve got the correct pairs playing together and ultimately in the correct order.”
Among the returning players are junior All-Americans and reigning AVCA Pairs National Champions Kelly Claes and Sara Hughes. In just their first season playing together collegiately, USC’s No. 1 duo went an impressive 44-3 overall in 2015 en route to becoming the third USC pair in a row to claim the pairs title.
Now, the two will look to cement themselves as the best beach duo in the nation and make another big run together this season as the Women of Troy’s indisputable on-court leaders.
Also returning will be the experienced pair of senior Alexa Strange and junior Sophie Bukovec. Last season, both were named AVCA All-Americans for the first time in their careers after going 33-10 overall at USC’s No. 2 position and will provide key leadership and stability in 2016. Juniors Nicolette Martin and Allie Wheeler, who went 31-5 together at the four spot in 2015, move up one flight to stand at the No. 3 position this year, while sophomore Jenna Belton and freshman Abril Bustamante will suit up together in their place at No. 4. Rounding out the pairs will be sophomore Jo Kremer and graduate student Zoe Nightingale, debuting at the No. 5 position.
With one AVCA national championship already under their belts, team captains Bukovec and Hughes are hoping their team can leave an imprint on this the inaugural season of NCAA beach volleyball.
“Our main goal is ultimately to win the first ever NCAA National Championship, because this is the first official year as an NCAA sport,” Hughes said. “That’s really what our team is striving for.”
However, the team knows that the road to the championship in Gulf Shores, Alabama, won’t be easy.
“I think that because we are ranked No. 1, we have a pretty big target on our back,” Hughes said. “It’s going to be about us taking things one point at a time and one match at a time. Then, we’ll get to that ultimate goal of winning the national championship, which I really think we can achieve.”
Bukovec also noted that the early pressures of being the No. 1-ranked team in the nation will be a challenge that the Women of Troy are up for.
“Expectation goes hand in hand with pressure, and that’s something I think our team is really good at handling,” Bukovec said. “We’re just going to come out and use it as fuel for each and every match.”
Collier was more frank in describing what her team needs to do in order to repeat as national champions.
“Honestly, I think we’re going to have to play better than we did last year,” Collier said. “Everybody wants to win the first NCAA Championship, so everything is elevated. Every team that lines up on the opposite side of the net will play their best match against us, so we need to make sure that we not only know that, but also know that we’re still going to win in the end.”
In addition to the star-studded roster, USC boasts an impressive coaching lineup as well. Collier herself is a former three-sport athlete and All-American at USC and has coached women’s beach volleyball teams in a pair of Olympics. Named AVCA National Coach of the Year in 2014, Collier has compiled a 74-15 record as USC’s first and only head coach. Also returning to the sidelines as volunteer assistant is former gold medalist and two-time beach volleyball Olympian Dain Blanton, while Ali Lamberson comes to Troy in her first year as assistant coach. Lamberson, formerly a volunteer assistant at Tulane, brings 25 years of experience as a player, coach and administrator and has worked with Collier for more than 20 years.
With all of these factors put together, Collier thinks she has the recipe for success.
“I’m expecting us to come out and play some good, solid, elite volleyball, which I always call ‘USC volleyball’ because it’s true — we are elite,” Collier said. “So, I think if we can just play USC volleyball, we’re going to be fine.”
USC will begin their quest to win the first-ever NCAA Beach Volleyball Championship this weekend in Malibu for the Pepperdine Kick Off. The Women of Troy will face off against four of the nation’s top six ranked teams in this tournament, starting with No. 3-ranked Hawaii on Saturday at 10:15 a.m., followed by a match against host and No. 2-ranked Pepperdine at 12:45 p.m.

Tuition will increase by $1,978 for the 2016-2017 school year, according to the website of USC’s Financial Aid Office.
A screenshot of the website showing the changes went viral on social media Tuesday night.
The administration did not release a corresponding statement alongside the increase. Instead, the estimated cost of attendance was updated on the financial aid website, sometime after Sunday night. The Office of Financial Aid did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

The total estimated cost increased from $67,212 for the current academic year to $69,711 for the 2016-2017 year.
The largest source of the estimated $2,500 hike can be attributed to a 4 percent increase in tuition fees. The second greatest source of increase from room and board costs, which are calculated from the average living costs of students living in on-campus freshman housing and includes a standard meal plan.
There was also an estimated $300 decrease in the cost of books and supplies, and a $300 increase in personal and miscellaneous costs. The only fee to stay constant is the transportation fee, which has stayed at $580. None of these changes have been explained yet.
The USC board of trustees meet annually to set tuition fees. No students are included on the board.
In 2015, a resolution calling for a tuition freeze was authored by current Undergraduate Student Government President Rini Sampath, Assistant Director of the Academic Culture Assembly Luis Vidalon-Suzuki and USG marketing assistant director and Senator-elect Paul Samaha. Despite the resolution passing in the USG senate in November of last year, the College Affordability and Financial Transparency Resolution has not been implemented by the administration.
Holly Huber, a sophomore studying biomedical engineering, commented on the tuition hikes and mentioned the resolution that passed was passed by the Senate.
“I think it’s outrageous that the university isn’t listening to the student voice,” Huber said. “Their first priority should be the students; obviously USG had a huge movement to pass a resolution to stop the tuition hike, and [the administration] just did not listen.” Huber said.
Overall, Huber expressed confusion at the lack of transparency between the administration and the student body.
“I don’t understand what their priority is, if not the student voice,” Huber said.
 
UPDATE:
In a statement, Provost Michael Quick said that tuition increases, using 5-year averages, are at the lowest in 50 years.
“The University has made great strides in limiting the tuition increases to maintain affordability, while increasing services to students,” Quick said.
Quick said that the actual cost of attendance is lower than the stated cost of attendance for most students due to USC’s financial aid programs and that USC graduates have lower average debt and loan default rates compared to graduates of other private universities. He also said that the University absorbs some costs that are not reflected in tuition payments.
“We estimate our tuition rate only covers 2/3 of the actual cost of education,” Quick said. “The university covers the balance, because that is part of the commitment we make to our students.”

The USC Environmental Core, also known as E-Core, hosted a student rally advocating for the use of solar panels on campus Wednesday at 12:30 p.m. in Hahn Plaza.
The event began with a speech from Keoki Kakigi, a first-year masters student in green technologies program and a leader in E-Core’s Go Solar campaign. Following this introduction, students assembled in Hahn Plaza and began chanting in support of solar power for USC. Phrases used by the group included “This is the hour for solar power!” and “Be bright! Use the light!” The rally concluded when Kakigi delivered a letter from E-Core to the office of President C. L. Max Nikias, as well as a list of signatures from students in support of the Go Solar campaign.
The Environmental Core’s goal for the Go Solar initiative is that 10 percent of USC’s energy will come from solar power in the near future, according to its website. Ideal locations to install solar panels on campus include the Galen Center, which features the University’s largest roof area and the upcoming USC Village, whose roofs will already be solar ready in compliance with LEED standards when construction ends.
With approximately 284 days of full sunlight in Los Angeles each year, E-Core sees the implementation of solar panels on campus as an easy decision, offering a means of saving money in the long term while bolstering USC’s commitment to sustainability and environmentalism with tangible efforts, which would also serve to enhance the University’s international reputation and appeal to incoming students.
“Climate change is most imminent threat to the world, and we would love to see USC, which projects itself as a cutting-edge, world-class university solving the world’s biggest problems, do its part to help mitigate the biggest problem facing us today,” Kakigi said.
In spite of these advantages, Kakigi said that the administration has noted several drawbacks to the plans advocated by the Go Solar campaign. A major concern of university officials is the aesthetic problems posed by the panels themselves, which many think would detract from the campus’s collegiate Gothic architectural style. Furthermore, the estimated five years it would take for the solar panels to pay for themselves is too long for many administrators, who have also found it difficult to attract donors for this project.
Though Sustainability 2020 has stated its commitment to be more environmentally conscious willingness to consider solar power in the future, Kakigi said that many of the energy committee’s members are the same administrators who were opposed to the Go Solar campaign in the beginning, posing a potential obstacle for any substantial policy changes down the line.
“We are not going to stand idle and hope that [administrators] change their minds,” Kakigi said. “Instead, we are going to try to be the change USC needs to install solar panels.”
For many students, USC’s reluctance to participate in some environmental efforts is surprising, and they hope to see real progress being made to achieve sustainability goals moving forward.
“The fact that none of our power comes from solar is kind of shocking to me,” said Woorin Lee, a freshman majoring in environmental science and health. “I think installing solar panels would also help to enhance our green image, especially considering recent global environmental movements in countries around the world. It’s a big issue, and we’re not taking part in it.”
Ariel Marks, E-Core’s co-president, said he was pleased with the turnout they received for this rally and that he hopes to increase awareness about the Go Solar campaign on campus in the future.
“We’re really trying to build student awareness and support,” Marks said. “Getting more students to support our cause is what will ultimately push this issue through administration.”
The day will come soon when most all on Earth use SOLAR ENERGY to power most all there needs.

USC’s administration requires all greek organizations on campus to adhere to a comprehensive code of regulations to better control parties and other large events.
The 11-page list of event rules explains in detail the standards that USC plans to hold all of its fraternities and sororities to in a new format with clearer instructions and expectations. The list contains dozens of specific rules regarding monitoring party guests, limiting the number of guests allowed at events and controlling the consumption and serving of alcohol.
Some of the rules involving guests specify that all events with alcohol must have a guest list, which is prepared and submitted to Fraternity and Sorority Leadership Development at least 24 hours before an event. The guest list must then be updated and resubmitted at least 48 hours after the event in order to account for any additional guests.
The new rules also mandate that a bodyguard be hired for every 50 anticipated guests.
Students have always had to register their parties in advance and all chapter leaders were informed of to the expectations in place when it came to alcohol, guests and permissions. The recently published guidelines are intended to complement the training provided to chapter officers.
“The guidelines were developed to meet the health and wellness and safety needs of the community, aligned with industry standards for insurance and safety, national organization risk management standards and peer institutions,” said Jenell Lanski, director of the Office for Fraternity and Sorority Leadership Development.
In the past, security was always present, but there was no minimum requirement of security guards. Also, fraternities often only submitted guest lists with male students for approval. This new policy adds onto the rule that prohibits using open Facebook groups or mass advertising to notify students of upcoming greek events. Instead, greek houses must take an invite-only approach to all future events.
Though the newly published guidebook may seem stringent, according to Interfraternity Council Executive Vice President of Administrative Affairs Peter Roberson, these rule changes won’t change a lot about how fraternities and sororities operate.
“Honestly, the rules haven’t really changed that much,” Roberson said. “Jenell and her team have mostly just strengthened a few rules and brought to light some old or forgotten ones.”

The USC Academic Culture Assembly hosted a discussion, “Stories Behind the Stats: Intersectionality in STEM,” Wednesday night. The panel on diversity was part of a series of events for EdMonth.
EdMonth, also put on by ACA, lasts all of March and aims to bring awareness to the state of education in America by empowering students, especially marginalized ones, that may have more difficult access to schooling. Wednesday’s discussions focused on the lack of diversity in STEM fields and how race, sex and socioeconomic factors influence success in the field.
The panel featured four women in STEM, all of whom had faced discrimination in their respective fields. USC students Dora Gerardo, a junior studying mechanical engineering, and Sabrina Enriquez, a sophomore math major, are both minorities in their majors.
“Mechanical engineering is a white-dominated field,” Gerardo said. “In my class, there are five women and 30-something males. Of everyone, there are four Latinas. It really shows the lack of diversity.”
Despite being a math major, Enriquez found many of her peers came in knowing a lot more about math than she did, as she was not offered the same opportunities at her poorly funded public school.
“You can’t really make up that gap. You’re always trying to catch up,” Enriquez said.
But these hardships often leave a determination to succeed.
“[Others] had all these resources in high school. Yeah, they have had all these opportunities, but I’m in the same room as them. I’m here too,” Gerardo said. “I’m going to make my mark, and I think I have made my mark.”
USC isn’t the only place where there is a lack of diversity in STEM. Research Associate in Physics at the University of Washington Chanda Prescod-Weinstein studied at Harvard University for her undergraduate degree and found her sex, race and socioeconomic status a difficult point of difference.
“I knew things didn’t feel good for me,” Prescod-Weinstein said. “I was the only person in my 15-person study group study group that had work-study.”
Even getting to college was difficult for Prescod-Weinstein. She self-taught herself much of AP Calculus AB, as her class had too many students to get through all the material. Despite being proud of herself, she still missed out on the benefit of traditional learning.
“I had missed out on the bit where the teacher teaches you how to solve problems and be systematic,” Prescod-Weinstein said.
The panelists acknowledged the competitive nature of STEM fields, something that is exacerbated by their need to prove themselves.
“STEM can be very unsupportive, even if you are a rich, cis, straight, blond guy who is very good-looking, and for the rest of us, it can be more difficult,” Prescod-Weinstein said. “There are many, many things we could do in the scientific community to stop feeling [alienated] … We just don’t do them.”
USC, however, does have some programs that attempt to create a sense of community for minorities in engineering, including the Society of Women Engineers, the National Society of Black Engineers and Queers in Engineering, Science and Technology, among others.
Now a research associate  that teaches and mentors other students, Prescod-Weinstein has a word of advice.
“You have to have the confidence of a mediocre white guy,” she said.

Whiskey Tango Foxtrot is actress and comedian Tina Fey’s newest flick about an adventure-seeking journalist trying to make a difference in Afghanistan. With famed television mogul Lorne Michaels serving as producer and a cast of A-listers, WTF should be a slam dunk, and it is — sort of. The biggest issue is that WTF doesn’t know what it is. Is it a satire on war films? Is it a drama chronicling a journalist’s actual experiences? Or is it a cliché female-led comedy? It’s a tough call because the film doesn’t know the answer either. Fey’s performance yo-yos so much that the audience feels a little motion sick by the ending. It’s as if no matter what Fey does, even talking to a vet with his legs blown off, she always seems to be acting in an Saturday Night Live  sketch.
A good question to now ask is what is WTF even about: Fey plays Kim Baker — based off real-life journalist Kim Barker whose memoir, The Taliban Shuffle ,inspired the making of the film — the typical middle-aged-no-husband-no-kid-workaholic-woman-with-a-crappy-desk-job story. The film is set in 2003, and every news station wants a reporter in Afghanistan. Kim is bumped from copy editing to war correspondent. She quickly calls her “mildly-depressive” boyfriend to say she’ll be gone for three months and leaves for Afghanistan, no biggie. After a tearful 15-second scene of not feeling like she can handle it, Kim totally finds her groove. That three months eventually turns into three years. Kim finds not just best friends at her base in “the Stan” but also an exciting job worth sacrificing everything for.
Luckily the film has two things going for it — humor and a story. The only question people ask before they see a Fey movie is “Is it funny?” Yes, the film is funny. Not every joke or gag lands, but for the most part the audience was hysterically laughing. The story also works — WTF isn’t a cheap thrill. Screenwriter Robert Carlock packs in some meat as well, though it drags at some points.
Fey plays Kim with hilarious honesty that carries the film — no question. She doesn’t try to make the audience love her character; she tries to make the audience see themselves in her shoes. Iain MacKelpie (Martin Freeman) comes into Kim’s life as the Scottish freelance photographer who waits as long as it takes for her and her boyfriend to break up. Alfred Molina (a surprising casting choice) shows off his comedic chops as the attorney general of Afghanistan. While Molina and Freeman are two audience favorites — how could they not be? — Margot Robbie steals every scene as Kim’s fellow war correspondent and rival, Tanya. Besides the fact that Kim gets the most interesting storyline, Tanya gets the funniest jokes.
Kim’s life is now full of interesting people, and she begins to question why she plans to go back home to New York at all. Kim stands out because she is one of the most realistic characters brought to life on the big screen. She’s neither the heroine nor anti-heroine, but rather an incredibly normal woman, who makes good and bad decisions, that is brave enough to do something about her lot in life. The film boasts of laughs most of the time, but there’s a real heart beating in its chest.

On Feb. 19, a judge declined to free pop star Kesha from her contract with her producer and accused abuser, Dr. Luke. On Feb. 28, at the 88th Academy Awards, Lady Gaga gave a powerful performance of “Til It Happens To You,” which was written about her experience being raped. That same evening, Vice President Joe Biden spoke out against sexual assault on college campuses before he introduced Lady Gaga to the crowd. This week, the USC Women’s Student Assembly is hosting Take Back the Night, a week dedicated to ending the stigma around sexual assault and helping survivors.
I’ve written about sexual assault for this column previously, but considering the increase in attention the issue has been receiving in national media, I thought it was time to bring it up again.
When Lady Gaga’s “Til It Happens To You” music video came out in September of last year, I avoided it. I had heard through the grapevine that it has several graphic depictions of rape, and I was worried about the voyeuristic responses it might receive. Not that I thought people might get off on it — although, there are people who do — but I was more concerned with the possibility of people watching it with the sick fascination of ‘I’m glad it’s her and not me.’ It happens when we watch horror movies: We’re always grateful that the person being torturously murdered on-screen is not you or me, and that turns us into voyeurs.
After watching the chilling Oscars performance, I knew I should watch the music video. What I didn’t expect, however, was for the video to be a PSA for sexual assault on campus.
“The following contains graphic content that may be emotionally unsettling but reflects the reality of what is happening daily on college campuses,” prefaces the video.
It ends with, “One in five women will be sexually assaulted this year unless something changes.”
What’s potent about Gaga’s performance and music video, however, is that both end with a ray of hope for survivors. Often, depictions of rape in popular media are bleak and horrifyingly real. Think: Law and Order: Special Victims Unit and The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo.
In Campus Sexual Assault: College Women Respond, author Lauren J. Germain gives a voice to the voiceless — the women who are raped. Too often, sexual assault is discussed with little to no input from the survivors, who should be the ones we listen to.
Germain’s book breaks down the statistics of college campus rape beyond just the numbers. Take, for example, USC. Being told that 30 percent of undergraduate females at USC have reported being sexually assaulted or harassed is different from realizing how many women that number refers to. There are 19,000 undergraduate students enrolled at USC, 53 percent of whom are females. That’s 30 percent of 10,070 female students, which is roughly 3,021 students.
Can you comprehend that? I can’t.
If around 3,000 female students at USC have reported being sexually assaulted or harassed, it stands to reason that in my large class of 100 people, at least one of my classmates will have experienced that. It could be that girl who sits in the corner of the class and never speaks up, or it could be the girl who always sits in the front row with a macchiato at her elbow.
Germain also bases her book around action rather than despair.
“Rather than concentrate exclusively on themes around hardship and hopelessness, which are present in many of the narratives, the book illustrates how women exercised their agency following attacks,” Germain writes in the first chapter.
Germain defines agency as “an equation […] the socioculturally medicated capacity to act + intention + action,” adding, “my hope is to contribute to the creation of a safer and more supportive higher education system where campus sexual assault is not a norm.”
What’s fascinating about Campus Sexual Assault: College Women Respond is that the author reframes the conversation about sexual assault by focusing on the aftermath rather than the attacks themselves, a rarity when it comes to such a sensitive topic.

Have you ever wondered how your favorite Disney films come to life? On Wednesday, USC students were invited to get a glimpse inside the creation of Disney’s new animated comedy Zootopia directed by Byron Howard, Rich Moore and Jared Bush. The event took place in the Ray Stark Family Theater and was sponsored by Walt Disney Animation Studios.
Chad Sellers, current animation adviser for Disney Animation, took the audience on a journey through his career of overseeing the performances of characters from the director’s perspective, while maintaining a consistency in the characters’ personalities. Furthermore, Sellers divulged everything one needs to know about what goes into animating popular family films.
Sellers has been working with Disney Animation since 2009 and is known for his work in popular films, such as Tangled, Feast, Wreck-it-Ralph and Frozen.  Prior to working for Disney, Sellers worked with Sony Picture Imageworks as an animator of the popular films, Cloudy With a Chance of Meatballs and Pirates of the Caribbean. In his films, Sellers focuses on specific characters in individual sequences which leads to the development of main characters and the production of the overall story, all while maintaining the director’s vision of the film.
Zootopia, Sellers’ most recent work, is a story of a capital city where all of the residents are animals. Just like Los Angeles, the city of Zootopia is a diverse city with residents coming from high-income and low-income areas. The story line revolves around Judy Hopp, a bunny who has become a police officer among a workforce of tough animals. With a will to prove her capabilities in the law enforcement field, Officer Hopps takes on her own investigation and leads the audience through an adventurous comedy in the metropolitan area.
The film features many pop culture references that aren’t too hokey, and even pokes fun at Disney’s stereotypical cheesiness. In addition, Zootopia is said to tackle many social issues that are present in today’s society, including sexism and racial diversity.
In addition, the voices of Jason Bateman and Ginnifer Goodwin are featured in the Disney film among a cast of directors, Rich Moore and Jared Bush, commonly known for directing animations such as The Simpsons and Penn Zero: Part Time Hero.
Guests attending the event had the opportunity to view a behind-the-scenes animation presentation. The audience also had a chance to ask Sellers their own questions about animation and his advising along with his prior experience with Disney during an open Q&A. Additionally, guests had the chance to win tickets to a 3D advance screening of Zootopia as a part of Leonard Maltin’s film symposium scheduled for Thursday at 7:45 p.m.
Zootopia will be released in theaters Friday. More information regarding the film can be found online.

Spring break may be just around the corner, but this week, midterms take center stage. It’s times like these that the fear of falling behind pushes some to extreme measures — sometimes in the form of Adderall, a psychoactive drug commonly prescribed to treat attention deficit disorders. It’s more often than not used as an academic steroid.
If Adderall use at USC looks anything like it does at other universities, chances are, it’s everywhere. Over the years, non-medical use of Adderall has risen 67 percent and emergency room visits are up 156 percent, according to a study published last month in The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry by the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health. Specifically, 60 percent of these misusers fall into the 18 to 25 age group as Adderall abuse skyrockets on college campuses across the nation.
The root of the problem, however, isn’t just the pill itself. It’s the blasé attitude surrounding its use. It’s the fact that students often equate this Schedule II stimulant — classified in the same class as narcotics like oxycodone, cocaine and opium — to coffee or a can of Red Bull.
“Many of these college students think stimulants like Adderall are harmless study aids,” the study’s co-author Ramin Mojtabai said. “But there can be serious health risks and they need to be more aware.”
A 2010 study surveyed 175 students who described Adderall as no more dangerous than drinking a lot of coffee. Many justified it because it’s only used in moderation during exam season. Some also argued that they were taking Adderall for the right reasons — not to get high, but to get higher grades.
But if Adderall were as innocuous as they believe, the increase in related ER visits from 862 visits in 2006 to 1,489 in 2011 doesn’t fit. Clearly, those who use it without prescription aren’t sufficiently aware of the dangers of overdosing or the host of side effects. An addictive amphetamine, Adderall can cause increased anxiety, agitation, insomnia and blood pressure, while suppressing appetite. Its components — dextroamphetamine saccharate, dextroamphetamine sulfate, aspartate and sulfate — hardly sound like the ingredients in your morning cup of Starbucks. But perhaps for students who need it for a paper due in a few hours, this isn’t a priority.
The pharmaceutical industry isn’t much help either. According to The New York Times, the FDA has cited every major ADHD drug for false and misleading advertising since 2000. In 2012, the Harvard Crimson approved an ad for ADDTabz, a non-prescription alternative to Adderall, before pulling it. The fact that they ran it shows that pills that promise cognitive edge without prescription or true medical need are gaining a semblance of normalcy.
Psychologically, it can also become a crutch. Writer Kate Miller shared her struggles in The New York Times. She took Adderall for the first time as a senior at UCLA, but then began using it routinely during her first professional job.
“Without the drug I felt stupid, unable to focus or follow a thought through to completion. I was shy and unwilling to initiate conversation. The witty, articulate woman I once was seemed to no longer exist,” Miller wrote. Studying without it could seem almost sluggish once one has experienced its speed.
In May 2010, the Engemann Student Health Center at USC cracked down and tightened up regulations and examinations on students requesting Adderall prescriptions. But as students interviewed  in the Daily Trojan hinted at, even if prescriptions are strictly regulated, students will still be able to access the drug through classmates, friends or family who have prescriptions. A 2011 study published in the Journal of Addictive Diseases found that 62 percent of college students prescribed Adderall hand over their pills to others.
The only way to rid campuses of Adderall is through cultural — not institutional — change. It all boils down to a broader issue related not only to a blasé attitude about Adderall, but to our tendency to compromise health in exchange for academic success. In the pressure cooker that is college, students are so caught up in the throes of resume building and GPAs that health, in the moment, seems like a small thing to give up. Two hours of sleep a night, a meal skipped here and there. The question is, will we be there to enjoy those ends if the means to get there have eaten away at us? We have that youthful sense of invincibility now, but that doesn’t last forever.
College is a time of transition into adulthood. Exploration is a big part of that — but so is developing healthy habits of stress management for the real world. In less than four years, we’re heading out into a place where issues don’t just amount to tomorrow’s 10-page paper, and where miracle pills don’t guarantee overnight success.
Valerie Yu is a senior majoring in English literature and biological sciences. She is also the blogs editor of the Daily Trojan. Her column, “Heart of the Matter,” runs every other Thursday.

Early last year, Stanford University proudly announced the latest installment in a series of progressive tuition waivers. Following the lead of fellow elite universities, such as Princeton University and Harvard University, Stanford promised free tuition for families who earn less than $125,000 per year and have less than $300,000 in assets.
Even though tuition waivers such as the one implemented at Stanford represent a progressive stepping stone toward academic equality, efforts to address college affordability cannot stop at providing financial compensation. Waiving tuition for a select few neglects the countless other ambitious students who aspire to enter elite universities, yet simply lack the resources to do so. The most effective way to tackle pervasive educational inequity is to provide free college education to the hardworking students who not only need it, but also unequivocally deserve it. Such a solution eliminates the emphasis on tuition waivers, expanding our public school network.  The facade of scholarships and financial aid mask the vexing bias toward high-income students, obscuring the underlying need for free public higher education.
Though the notion of free college tuition may make some conservatives want to jump off of the fiscal cliff, this policy is more feasible than it may seem. The fallacy that many view as the solution of inequity is bolstering financial aid. Yet, augmenting the amount of financial aid simply creates new divisions. Students coming from families with very low income levels may sometimes receive sufficient aid, yet others often receive an insufficient stipend that forces them to spend much of their time working to earn money. On the other hand, due to the allocation of funds toward lower-income families, middle-class families, who may not be able to pay for college, must make due with often-insufficient financial aid.
Financial aid is removing education from higher education, placing a larger burden on working to pay for college rather than seeking knowledge. When students cannot afford tuition even after financial aid, they must sometimes enter the dark pit of high-interest student loans. In order to fully pay tuition, students continuously take out loans, lowering their credit scores. The coup de grâce of this financial aid trap is that poor credit can lead to low job prospects, continuing a vicious cycle that the dedicated low-income scholar should never justly be trapped in.
In order to minimize the academic dichotomy and create a more equal and productive society, our nation must update our archaic public education system, expanding it to adopt free higher education. In previous decades, a high school degree could result in stable  industrial jobs. These industrial jobs are now dwindling, comprising only 10 percent of total employment, versus 25 percent of employment in 1970. Due to the greater need for a college degree, public education must be expanded to meet the needs of an ever-growing economy, in order to keep the United States a global leader in productivity.
The good news for those who are likely screaming bloody murder at the notion of tuition-free college, higher taxes are not the answer. The solution is not even to “feel the Bern” by adopting Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders’ plan of implementing legislation that would heavily tax Wall Street. In fact, the federal government already has the funds to establish free higher education. The estimated aggregate tuition paid by both undergraduates and graduates at public four-year colleges and community colleges amounted to about $60 billion in 2012. Keeping this figure in mind, the federal government allocated roughly $77 billion in federal non-loan education revenue, such as tax breaks and grants. Reallocating the funds allocated for tax breaks and grants toward free public higher education could finally eliminate some of the greatest educational problems our country faces today.
The attendance at public institutions would likely skyrocket as a result of newfound free tuition, skewing the aforementioned numbers and admittedly making free tuition less feasible. However, there is another source of governmental cost that could be eliminated, making the possibility of free public education attainable in years to come. The federal government spends an estimated $104 billion in subsidizing student loans. Government spending to make college affordable, in fact, seems to be doing the opposite. By allocating this capital toward free tuition, students would be relieved of the financial burden of loans, and such measures would help terminate the plague of joblessness due to poor credit at the hands of insurmountable debt.
Free education, despite its feasibility, is an undeniably progressive leap from the current public education system. Public pressure is the catalyst needed to spark  public education reform, in order to finally provide each American citizen with the college education he or she truly deserves. Only then can college education be seen as a right to all who seek to attain it, rather than a privilege reserved for the wealthy.
Ryan, before you graduate do yourself a favor and take Econ 101.  There is no such thing as a FREE anything, whether it be tuition, housing, food, etc.  An educated person living in America must understand that for someone to get something “free,” someone else is paying for it.  Your notion that the federal government already has the funds to establish free higher education is faulty.  Assuming there is a stockpile of cash sitting around waiting to be spent, that pile came from — you guessed it, taxpayers.  Yes, you will be a taxpayer someday and will see what your take-home pay looks like after Uncle Sam and his greedy family gets a hold of money that you earned to pay for someone else’s free lunch.
If there is a dearth of white collar jobs….then what’s the hoopla about this “free college?” College isn’t for everyone, and few people who are college grads are successful.

At a very young age, I already knew one thing for sure: I wanted to be in the music industry when I grew up. Despite being an artist and playing guitar and singing my whole life, I also knew that I never really wanted to be a starving artist. I figured out very quickly that there was a specific niche that I knew I could use all my talents and skills alongside my love of the music world. This niche is the music industry. It’s a really broad term that basically involves everyone that makes, produces, distributes and legalizes anything that involves music. Despite the fact that I knew a lot about the industry before I ever started here at Thornton, I have come to learn over the years that there are several things many people don’t expect, but should know before considering this industry. 
As a woman, this was a shock, but not an obstacle for me. However, I know that for many people this is incredibly daunting. The music industry is largely male-dominated, which makes being a female a whole other game to play. To be a female in the music industry you have to be twice as ambitious and twice as driven to get to where you want to be. For example, less than 5 percent of recognized producers are women, and generally there is only 32.2 percent women in the entire industry compared to men, who make up 67.8 percent. 
It may seem like there is an area that you want to go into that is very narrow and specific, but it’s important to know that being in this industry means that there is a whole world you have to learn about that surrounds it. To be truly successful, you have to learn about the nuances and details of it all. For example, many believe that producers solely oversee the recording process of songs, yet many of them are also writers, artists and musicians because they need an extensive knowledge of music across all mediums. 
Obviously not everyone in the music industry has a musical background necessarily, but most do. If you want to get into the music industry but don’t play an instrument or sing or have any prior musical experience, it’s totally fine but be prepared for likely having to work twice as hard due to your lack of inherent musical knowledge that most musicians possess. There are several major industry leaders who had no musical background, such as Simon Cowell, Scooter Braun and Pasquale Rotella, and yet, they’re just as successful. 
This industry is one that is constantly evolving and changing, so no matter how much you learn, know or experience, you will always be surprised. Even within the past ten years, the evolution of EDM and DJing along with brand new trends in alternative and indie/rock have proven the constantly evolving world of music. In fact, this is one of the more exciting parts of this industry. It keeps you on your toes and always guessing about the future of music. Be prepared for an exciting journey!

We all have those days when we can’t muster up the energy to cook ourselves a meal. Or the days when we’re simply tired of the repetitive options that the dining halls offer. When those times come, all we want is to crawl into bed and and eat. These five foods require minimal effort to prepare, and will be there for you on your laziest days. All college students should get acquainted with them.
1. Instant Noodles
 Every college student’s ultimate go-to for instant food, a cup of instant noodles is the perfect solution whether you’re in search of a good meal or just a snack.
2. Easy Mac
Kraft has created bliss in a cup by giving college students an easy way to make a childhood favorite with a microwave and some powdered cheese.
3. Hot Pockets
The trend “when mom says she bought pizza rolls” on Twitter exists for a reason. Pepperoni and melted cheese encased in fried dough beats anything found in the dining hall or anything that I could make myself.
4. Pop-Tarts
 When you’re running late for class and you don’t have time to swing by the dining hall or  whip something up, a great alternative is a Pop-Tart. Delicious warm or cold, Pop-Tarts come in a variety of different flavors for all suitors.
5. Oatmeal
If you’re looking for a healthier breakfast option that is also quick and easy to make, oatmeal is a great alternative to Pop-Tarts. With some water and a microwave, instant oatmeal can be heated up for a great meal in the morning and also comes in a variety of different flavors.
