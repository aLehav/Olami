The men’s golf season begins this weekend as USC hits the road for the Maui Jim Invitational, while the women start off at the Annika Invitational Monday. The Trojans are debuting fresh faces and hoping for successful results at both courses.
Men’s head coach Chris Zambri and women’s head coach Justin Silverstein said that they placed emphasis on competition amongst the players in the preseason. Both teams held intrasquad competitions where the five strongest performers earned spots in the starting lineup.  
As the men’s team is coming in at No. 11 in the Golf Coaches Association of America’s preseason poll, the expectations will certainly be high for the team at the invite in Scottsdale, Ariz. The starting lineup includes senior Kyle Suppa, junior Issei Tanabe, junior transfer Leon D’Souza, freshman Yuxin Lin and sophomore Charlie Reiter. 
After losing two-time All-American Justin Suh last season, whom Zambri called USC’s best men’s golfer ever, the Trojans will have to find strength in their younger players. The Maui Jim Invitational marks Lin’s first appearance in a college tournament, and Zambri is expecting big things out of the freshman.
“[Lin] is playing some really good golf,” Zambri said. “His game looks like he’s ready to make a huge impact right now.”
Zambri also suggested that although Suh’s talent will be missed, the Trojans’ depth may make them a better all-around team this season.
“I think we’re a little deeper this year than we were last year, and so it’s going to be hard for anyone to match the kind of year that Justin had, the kind of career that he had, but everyone clearly is hoping to,” Zambri said. “But even if we weren’t to get that kind of performance out of any one person, in total, I think we have a better team this year.
The Trojans will play throughout the weekend in a tough competition field that includes No. 10 Pepperdine and No. 2 Arizona State. As for the rest of the season, the men’s team will compete in several tournaments including the Nike Collegiate in Portland, Ore. and the Cypress Point Classic at Pebble Beach.
According to senior Kyle Suppa, the team’s objective this season is placing well in tournaments to establish a solid ranking for the postseason. 
“Every tournament our goal is to win,” Suppa said. “That’s our main focus … We have to avoid bad tournaments because that can really hurt our ranking and affect our seeding going into the postseason.”
The women’s team will be heading to Lake Elmo, Minn. to compete in the Annika Invitational Monday. As a past champion of the event, the Trojans will face the top competitors in women’s college golf with No. 6 UCLA, No. 12 Arizona and No. 10 ASU all in the 54-hole stroke play. The starting lineup includes senior Aiko Leong, senior Allisen Corpuz, junior Jennifer Chang, junior Gabriela Ruffels and junior Alyaa Abdulghany. 
WGCA, Golf Week and Golf Channel all ranked the women’s golf team No. 1 in their preseason polls. Coming off a seven-win season with all ten players returning, Silverstein’s squad is experienced and looking to continue its success.
“I think we’re so talented and so deep, that it helps prepare us for the end of the season with the tougher teams,” Silverstein said.
Silverstein stressed his belief that the team won’t be “truly satisfied” until it completes a clean sweep of the season, winning every tournament it enters. The Trojans’ competitions include the Windy City Collegiate Invitational starting at the end of September, Stanford Intercollegiate in October and the Pac-12 Preview in November. 
“It’s a process for sure,” junior Jennifer Chang said. “Obviously we had a great year last year and, you know, we just want to keep it going, keep that momentum.”
As the competition season begins, both the men’s and women’s teams hope to prove that the work they put in during the preseason will show on the course. Their performances this weekend will indicate if the men’s team can recover from the loss of a star player and if the women’s team can maintain its all-star reputation.

More than 100 people attended a live viewing and discussion of the third Democratic primary debate at Wallis Annenberg Hall Thursday evening.   
At the event, a panel of commentators offered analysis and fielded questions from audience members. Panelists included Democratic strategist Bill Carrick, Annenberg Media Center Director Christina Bellantoni, former MSNBC producer Ann Klenk, former special assistant to President George W. Bush Ron Christie and Center for the Political Future Director Robert Shrum. 
The event was co-organized by CPF and the Annenberg Center on Communication Leadership and Policy.
Attendees responded vocally to the diverse crop of politicians with energetic laughter in response to infighting among candidates and groaning after former Congressman Beto O’Rourke answered a question in Spanish. 
Most of the debate, which was held at the historically-Black Texas Southern University, was devoted to healthcare, a contentious political topic. A few students in attendance expressed disappointment in the lack of time devoted to other topics they consider to be priorities. 
“I was kind of mad that they spent about 10 minutes on climate change and nothing else,” said Dinithi Senanayake, a freshman  studying biochemistry.
Panelists pointed to O’Rourke and former Housing and Urban Development Secretary Julián Castro as two standouts in the debate, specifically in reference to O’Rourke’s bold stance on gun buybacks. 
“Hell yes, we’re going to take your AR-15,” he said, while Castro was praised for his bold attacks against former Vice President Joe Biden for inconsistent characterizations regarding his time in office. 
Panelists initially pointed to Biden — the campaign frontrunner — as the candidate to watch since a number of “gaffes” at previous debates, including flubbing his own campaign’s URL address, have consistently prompted criticism from members of the press. 
As the debate went on, attention shifted from Biden’s past performances to what some panelists and audience members called “missed opportunities,” such as how he answered questions about his time working alongside former President Barack Obama. 
During the first commercial break, when one USC student criticized Biden’s inability to “distance himself” from some of Obama’s immigration policies, Shrum said that would be a “terrible mistake,” considering the praise Obama continues to receive for his time in office. 
“Barack Obama is by far the singularly most popular person in the Democratic party,” Shrum said. 
But after the debate ended, some panelists said that even after several missteps, such as Biden’s tangential response to a question about race and education that somehow pivoted to the topics of Venezuela and record players, Biden will most likely bounce back. 
“He’ll survive this. I think he’ll be fine,” Klenk said. 
During a 30-minute discussion before the debate, panelists conducted a straw poll on whom audience members considered a favorite going in. Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders received by far the most votes in the room, with Pete Buttigieg and Andrew Yang following close behind. Biden, though he remains the highest polling candidate nationwide, received among the lowest number of votes, which elicited some laughter from the audience. 
Panelists discussed how older and younger members of the press differ in their perceptions of Biden, who, until recently, was typically viewed favorably. 
“I personally like Joe Biden very much,” said Bellantoni, the former assistant managing editor for California politics at the Los Angeles Times. “I watch this and I think, ‘Man, this does not feel like it’s going to end well for his reputation.’ And that makes me kind of bummed out … presidential campaigns make people hate you.”
The event lasted almost five hours and saw attendees leave as energy dwindled.
“Look, it’s too long,” Bellantoni said. “It’s good — it’s a great, healthy debate — but the format is just a lot of talking and people lose interest and lose sight of what they’re actually saying.”

A program under the Sol Price Center for Social Innovation is collaborating with Microsoft and other organizations for the Criminal Justice Data Initiative to collect data on neighborhood crime in Los Angeles. The Neighborhood Data for Social Change program will study its connection to homelessness, housing, education, economic development and jobs.
This one-year initiative will track criminal justice trends in L.A. neighborhoods, including the rates of arrest and the number of incidents in which law enforcement use force. Neighborhood Data for Social Change aims to increase public safety in the local community and initiate conversations between local law enforcement and the neighborhood. 
“[NDSC] helps to broaden your understanding of how people are living,” said Caroline Bhalla, Sol Price Center for Social Innovation managing director. “You can’t just look at crime and all of a sudden you understand everything about the neighborhood. If you look at [crime, demographics, arrest, traffic collision data], you start to get a fuller picture of what’s going on in these neighborhoods.”
Peter Griffin, a research assistant for the Center for Social Innovation and the Safe Communities Institute, commented on the importance of data collection to help inform the community about local issues. 
“Every single person wants to feel safe, and you know the person next to you and the person that lives across the street from you wants to feel safe,” said Griffins, a graduate student studying public administration. “So that’s why we’re looking at the neighborhood level and [breaking] it down to what is it that the data says versus what is the perception.”
Before collaborating with Microsoft,  the project collected data on crimes against persons and property, said Erroll Southers, director of the Safe Communities Institute, which is also housed in Price. Now, the project will analyze  criminal justice data like arrests, stops and citizen complaints to help the community design strategies to improve its neighborhoods and collaborate with local law enforcement.
“We are trying … to determine what kind of information communities can take away … to design a strategy to make their neighborhood safer,” Southers said. “What we need to do is to find some kind of positive metric out of this project … law enforcement traditionally and organizationally has always measured negative when it comes to statistics. We’re trying to determine if there’s a way to determine positive outcomes for law enforcement.”
Along with Microsoft, other collaborators include USC Safe Communities Institute, the Urban Institute’s National Neighborhood Indicators Partnership and the Los Angeles Police Department. Microsoft helps fund the project and is part of the steering committee that partakes in the initiative’s community meetings. 
“It’s nice to see organizations like Microsoft get behind an effort like this. It shows how innovative they are in their thinking and that’s huge,” Southers said. “For that reason, we are working very hard to determine what kind of effectiveness this project can have … so hats off to Microsoft for having the confidence and trust in our centers to do something like this.” 
The initiative will also implement a series of community conversations to promote interaction between law enforcement, nonprofits, government agencies and other community members as well as inform the public in these neighborhoods about public safety on and off campus. 
“One of the things that we’re doing … is trying to get people to talk to each other who may not always talk to each other,” Bhalla said. “We’ve invited USC students as well as staff and faculty to attend these convenings and also to take part in this project. So they’re having the chance to learn about public safety here on campus but also off-campus.”
By collecting data on criminal justice in L.A. County neighborhoods, Griffin hopes to empower communities to implement their own methods of public safety. 
“It’s one thing to read an excel spreadsheet on what crime is in your area, but to visually see it and make it available for people all across Los Angeles … and give them the tools to empower themselves, to learn more about their community,” Griffin said. “Being able to empower your community is a crucial, fundamental issue for this project.
