Data from 2017-2018 USG BudgetSteven Kramer | Daily Trojan
Two Student Affairs programming departments will receive no funding from Undergraduate Student Government next year, while the USC Concerts Committee  budget and USG staff salaries will go up, Treasurer Donielle Bunyard announced at Tuesday’s Senate meeting. 
Last year, the Volunteer Center and the Leadership, Education and Development program received $73,250 and $19,000, respectively. If the budget passes at next week’s Senate meeting, these organizations will receive no funding from USG in the upcoming year.
“It was a little strange that professional staff members had to come to student government [for funding], so we thought it was more appropriate for Student Affairs to handle those costs,” Bunyard said. “[The decision to defund] was really a group effort. We felt that it was more appropriate for Campus Activities to fund those programs.”
In a memorandum released to USC Student Affairs, USG President Austin Dunn said the concern arose because professional staff members were required to present to a group of student leaders, as opposed to the typical peer student.
“The committee feels this does not coincide with the purpose of the student programming fee that comes from the students, is allocated by students and distributed for students to fund student-run programs and activities,” Dunn said.
Some of the 15 assemblies, including the Speaker’s Committee, Special Events Committee, Latina/o Student Assembly and the Black Student Assembly, were allocated more funding because it was reallocated from the Student Affairs programming departments. 
The USC Concerts Committee’s proposed budget increased because safety issues cut this year’s Springfest short, according to Bunyard. 
In the 2016-2017 school year, Concert Committee’s budget was $470,293. For the 2017-2018 school year, the committee would hold a $495,000 budget, a 5.25 percent increase.
Springfest was set to feature opening act Migos and headliner Rae Sremmurd, but was canceled when students were asked to evacuate two songs into Migos’ set. USC Fire Safety and Emergency Planning said that least 10,000 people attended the event and security was not prepared to handle the amount of people that attended. 
“This year in particular, Concerts Committee had a really great lineup of people,” said Krystal Chavez, who served as USG Program Board Executive Director during the 2016-2017 school year. “They upped their security people, but it wasn’t enough for the amount of people in attendance.”
Senators will vote on the proposed budget at their meeting on April 25.
This article has been updated to reflect the status of the budget proposal. The official budget has not yet been agreed upon, and will be voted on next week.

Philanthropist and USC Trustee Wallis Annenberg announced a $10 million donation to the USC Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism Monday night to celebrate journalist Willow Bay’s appointment as dean of the school. Wallis Annenberg’s father, Walter Annenberg, founded the Annenberg School for Communication in 1971, which was renamed to reflect the school’s journalism education 20 years later.
Wallis Annenberg was honored with the USC University Medallion at the annual Academic Honors Convocation for her philanthropy and leadership this year.
Wallis Annenberg is the fourth person to receive USC’s University Medallion. The award citation described her as “a steady source of inspiration for generations of Trojans, earning their admiration through her wise leadership and generous philanthropy.” 
Annenberg heads the Annenberg Foundation, a multibillion-dollar organization that was founded by her father, Walter. Wallis Annenberg serves as chairman of the board, president and CEO. She has overseen more than $500 million in donations in her roles at the foundation, over $360 million of which have been donated to USC. 
Wallis Annenberg Hall, an 88,000-square-foot facility with an emphasis on technology, opened in 2014 after a $50 million donation from the foundation. 
The hall is one of several buildings in Los Angeles funded by the heiress — a Vanity Fair article from 2009 wrote that “it sometimes seems as if Wallis Annenberg is single-handedly funding L.A., with all the community projects, art centers and medical buildings that bear her name.”
At the ribbon-cutting ceremony for the hall, USC President C. L. Max Nikias called Wallis Annenberg the “dean” of the Board of Trustees, as she is the longest-serving member. He also said that the building bearing her name will forever link her to USC.

Photo courtesy of Michelle ChristieHelping hand · Executive Director Michelle Christie and No Limits has helped students with hearing impairment attend college.
In the summer of 1996, USC alumna Michelle Christie noticed that children who suffered from hearing loss had few avenues to improve their speaking abilities. To combat this issue, Christie founded No Limits for Deaf Children, a program that would help these kids develop their skills and be successful at school. Through this after-school theater program — the only one of its kind in the United States, according to Christie — the kids were able to develop their communication skills through role-playing and character development.
Building on her work helping children with hearing loss, Christie was selected as a 2017 CNN Hero earlier this month. The award aims to recognize “everyday people changing the world,” according to the CNN website.
 “There are so many other people out there who are just as deserving, so it just feels very humbling,” Christie said. “I don’t know how to describe it — it’s an honor definitely. There are so many wonderful people in this world, and I think sometimes being a part of a nonprofit you can meet so many great people who are really giving back to the world.”
Christie, currently the executive director of No Limits, graduated from the John Tracy Clinic Program and later earned her a doctorate in education from the University of California, Los Angeles. 
No Limits has produced over 100 shows and reached over 200,000 people total since its recent production, Silent NO MORE, which was performed at Carnegie Hall in New York City.
“It’s like this little dream has become bigger than I even imagined,” Christie said. “What’s wonderful is that other people are sharing it so it’s not my dream anymore. It’s a dream for all the families and all the people who are a part of it, from volunteers to our staff to our board members to our community, we are all part of the dream now.”
Silent NO MORE aims for people to understand what children with hearing loss experience by telling individual monologues about their lives. Its creators want to hear what members of the Deaf community are thinking so they can have a discussion and help No Limits make a difference in their lives.
“We have people who only believe in sign language, and some of the kids who are cast members on stage speak and sign,” Christie said. “Some might disagree with that, but we can discuss it and see what we can do to bridge the different philosophies and work together to help all children with hearing loss. It doesn’t matter if they speak or use signs or do both — we want to do whatever we can to help these children succeed in school and life.” 
 While Christie was working in a classroom at the John Tracy Clinic in 1996, she wanted to build the confidence of the children who she was working with by helping them overcome their shyness and develop their communication skills. Christie started the first theater program during that summer in Los Angeles. The kids performed on stage for the first time, and according to Christie, it was amazing to watch their growth.
 Christie said that as a shy kid during her own childhood, she took to theater to build her confidence, literacy and public speaking skills. She said theater helped her mature and grow as a person.
“I think my background in theater was something that I always thought would be helpful as a teacher,” Christie said. “So when I was working with John, my first student, I was able to, as a speech teacher, bring in props and costumes to act things out so he could understand it, and I could see the results instantaneously.” 
 When Christie traveled across different cities to reach out to communities with hearing loss, she noticed that parents were struggling with the cost and of speech therapy and other after-school programs for their children. Christie wanted to help the children who came from low-income families and give them an opportunity to receive the services that they needed. 
To meet this need, she founded the No Limits Educational Center in Culver City in 2002, where children go three times a week and receive individual attention in speech therapy, literacy, academic tutoring and other services. Center members nurture the kids throughout their school year and also have weekly education classes where they invite deaf role models to speak about their experiences.
“It’s just a wonderful opportunity for these families who really don’t have access to a lot of resources to be able to have their child develop skills that they need to succeed in school and in life,” Christie said. “I am very excited about what we have been able to accomplish in the sense of allowing these kids to know that they can go to college one day.” 
No Limits has two other educational centers — one that opened in Las Vegas in 2013 and the other more recently in Oxnard, Calif. The organization creates a college-going culture at its educational centers and also holds graduation ceremonies for the children while involving their parents and talking to them about college. Children from No Limits have been able to enroll in colleges and graduate — and Christie said seeing their growth has been rewarding.
Different kids enroll every summer for the No Limits theater programs while the educational centers run throughout the school year. Every parent is involved in their child’s progress throughout their time at No Limits, and they also attend weekly parent classes every Saturday.
“They don’t drop off their child and leave — they actually stay and are a part of all the lessons,” Christie said. “During the weekly parent classes, we educate them about their rights, teach them advocacy skills, have them meet with other deaf adults and role models. It is a wonderful opportunity for them to know what they could do at home to work with their child.”
Clarification: A previous version referred to the Deaf community as the “deaf community.” The Deaf community signifies those who use sign language.

On a windy and overcast Tuesday afternoon in Stanford, Calif., the top-ranked USC beach volleyball team easily passed its road test, defeating the Cardinal 5-0 at Stanford Beach Volleyball Stadium in the first-ever meeting between the two Pac-12 programs. With straight-set sweeps on all five courts, the victory on The Farm pushes USC’s record to 26-0 on the season with a 56-match winning streak, while Stanford falls to 12-6 overall. 
It was a reunion of sorts for head coach Anna Collier and her Trojans, as first-year Stanford head coach Andrew Fuller served as an assistant under Collier from 2012 to 2015 and helped coach USC to its first AVCA National Championship back in 2015. However, it was the veteran who had the upper hand on her apprentice, as the Trojans seized control from the start and never relinquished their grip.
Courts four and five kicked things off for the Trojans, with USC getting on the board first from the No. 4 spot. Sophomore Abril Bustamante and freshman Joy Dennis jumped on Stanford’s Catherine Raquel and Shannon Richardson early and did not allow any breathing room, running away with a 21-12, 21-12 sweep for the Trojans’ first point of the dual. It was the first match back for Bustamante, as the sophomore had missed the last few weeks due to injury.
Soon thereafter, USC chalked up another straight-set sweep thanks to juniors Jenna Belton and Jo Kremer at the five spot, as the duo posted a 21-17, 21-13 win over Kat Anderson and Courtney Bowen for the second dual point. Kremer and Belton moved to 28-3 overall on the season with a 24-1 mark in duals, and they improved their winning streak to eight matches in a row. To close out the first flight of matches, sophomores Becca Dunn and Katrina Kernochan won their exhibition match against Jennifer DiSanto and Chelsea Red-Horse Mohl (21-16, 21-10). 
The dual was clinched at court two, as seniors Sophie Bukovec and Allie Wheeler defeated Payton Chang and Ivana Vanjak by a score of 21-16, 21-13 to mark their 13th win together on the season. Just a few minutes later, a win at the top court from seniors Kelly Claes and Sara Hughes over Stanford freshmen Jenna Gray and Kathryn Plummer (21-14, 22-20) gave the Trojans their fourth point. The victory improved Claes and Hughes’ all-time record to 123-4 overall. To sew up the 5-0 sweep, junior Terese Cannon and senior Nicolette Martin won their match at court three, 21-14,
21-17 over Stanford’s Morgan Hentz and Caitlin Keefe. The win was Cannon and Martin’s 24th on the season and their 21st dual victory in 2017. Overall, USC has won 88 of its last 90 duals during its lengthy unbeaten run.
It will be another short turnaround for the Trojans as they now head back down to Los Angeles to host two teams, No. 5 Long Beach State and Cal State Bakersfield, for a three-way dual meet on Thursday at Merle Norman Stadium. The Trojans have never lost to the Roadrunners, while the 49ers are one of just three teams to ever take a dual match against USC at home — most recently in 2013. Long Beach State  (23-5) and CSU Bakersfield  (1-12) will kick things off with a dual at noon, while the Trojans and Long Beach State are slated for a dual at approximately  2 p.m., which will be televised on Pac-12 Networks. To close out the meet, USC will take on the Roadrunners for a dual scheduled for around 4 p.m.

Katie Chin | Daily TrojanHot corner · Junior third baseman Adalberto Carrillo and his teammates endured a tough night on the diamond on Tuesday as USC fell in a blowout.
After dropping three straight series to Arizona, Stanford and Cal State Fullerton, the Trojans faced off against UC Irvine in two games as they battled to stay above .500. 
In the first contest at UC Irvine’s Irvine Bowl Park, the Trojans outlasted the Anteaters, winning 9-7 in a nailbiter. Sophomore second baseman Brandon Perez was instrumental in the win, going 3-for-4 with three RBIs and three runs scored. 
For the rematch, the Trojans returned to Dedeaux Field looking to repeat the dominant hitting performance from the previous day. In just his second start of the year, sophomore right-hander Solomon Bates got off to a rough start. He gave up three hits including a home run by Anteater designated hitter Keston Hiura. However, Bates recovered nicely, and USC exited with a two-run deficit that could have been a lot worse. 
“Solomon did really well,” Perez said. “He kept us in the ballgame for a while.” 
The Trojan batting order immediately responded to their early disadvantage with runs in both the first and second innings to tie the game. When USC loaded the bases with two outs in the bottom of the second, Anteaters pitcher Jordan Bocko had to go up against prolific sophomore hitter Lars Nootbaar. However instead of launching one of his signature bombs as he tends to do with runners in scoring position, Nootbaar settled for a walk that resulted in his 25th RBI of the year. 
In the top of the fourth inning, UC Irvine changed pitchers and lost their catcher, Matt Reitano, after he was apparently struck with a ball that bounced off the dirt. USC freshman designated hitter Blake Sabol worked his way to third base after hitting a single and advancing on a groundout and a wild pitch, but he was left stranded when sophomore Brandon Perez lined out to end the inning. It looked as though Perez had a clear line drive hit, but UC Irvine second baseman Cole Kreuter came out of nowhere, leaping into the air and snagging the ball.
The Anteaters broke the 2-2 tie in the next frame, as Bates gave up a double, followed by an RBI single. The road team inflicted further damage when Kreuter homered deep to left field. Suddenly, a tightly contested game turned into a 5-2 lead for the Anteaters and Bates was replaced by junior Mason Perryman. 
“I thought if we could hold it than I thought [there’d be a chance to come back],” head coach Dan Hubbs said. “We did it yesterday. They got ahead of us and then we responded, obviously against different pitchers than we saw today.”
Perryman fared worse than Bates. After giving up a walk, hitting a batter and allowing a bunt-single, Perryman hit another UC Irvine player, which gave the Anteaters a 6-2 advantage.
The inning only got worse for the Trojans from that point. Perryman then walked two straight batters for RBIs before the Anteaters recorded their fourth run of the inning on a sacrifice fly.
Hitting a batter for the third time and loading the bases again, Perryman’s outing ended when senior outfielder Corey Dempster failed to catch a difficult ball deep in right field. UC Irvine scored two more runs on the play before one of their runners was tagged out at home, mercifully ending a frame filled with both insult and injury. USC’s defense had plenty of opportunities to bail out their embattled pitcher with two outs, but they failed to catch three fly balls in a row. 
“[Perryman] has made some big pitches for us this year already,” Perez said. “We know he is way better than he was tonight. Everybody has an off day.”
USC tried to mount a comeback over the next three innings, but the large deficit as a result of the devastating sixth was too difficult to overcome. With freshman reliever Michael Gates in the game, the Trojans allowed two more runs in the seventh inning extending UC Irvine’s lead to 13-2.
Ultimately, UC Irvine won 14-3 after USC plated a run in the eighth and the Anteaters scored again in the ninth.  The team will have a couple days of rest before heading to Berkeley for a series against Cal. 
“We just need to play better,” Hubbs said. “Obviously we pitched poorly, played defense poorly and once the game got separated, it was ugly. We’re just going to scrap it and move on to the next one.”

On Monday, the latest UCLA star announced an early departure from the athletics program.
It wasn’t for the NFL or the NBA Draft. Instead, it was redshirt freshman Mallory Pugh — a star forward for the U.S. soccer team who debuted in the Olympics at the age of 17 — making the headlines. On Monday morning, Pugh made the decision to forgo her remaining four years of college eligibility in order to pursue a professional soccer career.
Pugh isn’t the first women’s soccer player to make this move — Lindsey Horan did the same two years ago, skipping the college process completely to play for Paris Saint-Germain F.C. in France. This decision is common among Olympic athletes in every sport. The reason? A set of NCAA rules that hold back college Olympians from receiving the same compensation as the rest of their team.
Due to NCAA restrictions, Olympians still can’t accept any form of payment or gifts from their federations. That means that Olympic athletes forgo massive paychecks in order to earn a college education.
Katie Ledecky, the current Stanford swimmer who won five gold medals in the Rio Olympics, made this fact famous when she was forced to refuse a waffle maker during a stint on The Ellen Degeneres Show. Despite the fact that she’d recently set multiple world records and won gold medals along the way, Ledecky couldn’t accept the gift in order to protect her “amateur” status in the NCAA.
The irony of this situation is that athletes like Pugh and Ledecky aren’t “amateurs” in any regard. Sure, they’re still college students and yes, they’ve only been legal adults for a few years. But these athletes represent some of the top competitors in the world, and they have already shaped and molded the future of their sports. Ledecky will always set the bar in any pool that she swims in, and Pugh is tough enough for veteran opponents to guard despite being only 18 years old.
Ultimately, Olympic athletes who decide to stay in college take on the duties of both an Olympian and a college athlete, but forgo many of the rewards of both teams. When the Olympics and the World Cup roll around, these elite athletes will even skip out on college practices and games to travel to national team camps and events. And many athletes won’t benefit from the free education that is considered “compensation” for their time as a college athlete — take, for example, former USC women’s soccer player Amy Rodriguez, who delayed her graduation in order to compete in the 2008 Olympics.
When discussions of NCAA player compensation and amateur restrictions are brought up, the most common argument in defense of these rules is one that protects sports such as women’s soccer or swimming. The main concern is that compensation and gifts would be aimed mainly at sports that turn a profit, such as football or men’s basketball, without the same funds being spread to less popular sports. This would seem unfair, especially since every college athletics team works the same demanding hours and invests the same level of effort while chasing a national title.
But the issue of national team compensation flips that argument completely on its head. When it comes to paying Olympic athletes, football and men’s basketball are completely removed from the conversation, as one is not an Olympic sport and the other fields a team of NBA players. In the Olympics, the teams stacked with NCAA talent are the less popular events that could be hurt by player compensation — anything from swimming and women’s soccer to water polo and gymnastics.
The intricacies of NCAA player compensation can be debated for hours, but this specific issue is simple. Olympic athletes should be allowed to accept money for their work on their national teams. The compensation comes from national federations, meaning that it puts no pressure on colleges to spend athletic funds on player paychecks rather than scholarships or other expenditures. This type of compensation also doesn’t allow fans to sway athletes or violate any type of “gift-giving” regulations that the NCAA feels are necessary.
In the end, there aren’t any clear reasons why the NCAA does not allow student Olympians to accept the same rewards as the rest of the team. After all, the athletes accept their medals — which are priced upwards of $500 — along with piles of team-branded gear, free flights and team events that include free games, concerts and more. The extension of a team salary seems as if it would follow common logic.
And in the end, how are these restrictions truly helping the NCAA? Whether or not Pugh or Ledecky enter their school with a U.S. salary in their bank account, they will remain the top athletes of their age groups. No amount of national team payment could change the fact that these athletes are the best of the best, and they certainly wouldn’t do anything about the fact that Ledecky will lap most of her competition, NCAA or international.
Pugh’s decision could put her at a level of risk that male college-stars-turned-pro don’t necessarily face, as women’s soccer doesn’t have the same financial payout as men’s sports like football or basketball. Although Pugh already has the star power to become the next Alex Morgan or Mia Hamm, her paycheck after a couple of years in the NWSL or the Euro Leagues will be only a fraction of the salary of men’s basketball or football
one-and-done stars.
Nonetheless, taking the leap into professional soccer this early is a gamble that, barring injuries, will pay off in the long run for Pugh. And next season, the NCAA will miss out on one of the most explosive players in the game.
It’s time for the NCAA to make a change. Allowing athletes to reap the benefits of their Olympic glory won’t do anything to hurt the college game — and it might, in fact, help it.

Junior goalie Gussie Johns was named the MPSF Defensive Player of the Week on Monday after a strong showing against No. 6 Colorado last Friday. Johns made nine saves and picked up three ground balls in USC’s 11-5 victory at the Coliseum, shutting out the Buffaloes during the entire second half.
The junior goalie is no newcomer to accolades. This is Johns’ second MPSF Defensive Player of the Week award of the year and her fifth career Player of the Week honor. Johns leads the country in goals against average (6.69) and is fourth in the nation in ground balls per game (4.0). Johns also continues to add to her program-record 289 career saves and 156 career ground balls. 
Monday marked the fifth consecutive week that a USC women’s lacrosse player took home a weekly conference award. Senior attacker Michaela Michael leads the way, winning four straight MPSF Offensive Player of the Week awards — a streak that ended this week. Freshman midfielder Kerrigan Miller took home Rookie of the Week honors in March, and freshman midfielder Kaeli Huff also received the award two weeks ago. Johns’ accolade was her first since being named Defensive Player of the Week on Feb. 20.
Johns has gained national attention for her play in net for the Trojans. After dominating at USC during her first two collegiate seasons, Johns was named to the United States’ final roster in January for the 2017 FIL Women’s Lacrosse World Cup, which will be held in Guildford, England this summer.
Johns is one of just two current student-athletes on the national team, along with North Carolina junior midfielder Marie McCool. Also joining Johns on Team USA is Devon Wills, the Trojans’ associate head coach and defensive coordinator.
Next, USC will look to extend its six-game winning streak when the team travels to Stanford on Friday. A victory over the Cardinal would clinch the first seed in the MPSF tournament, which will be hosted at McAlister Field beginning April 27. Another win over UC Davis on Sunday would also set a new MPSF record for consecutive conference wins. While individual recognition is nice, Johns and the
now-sixth-ranked Trojans will strive for a conference title as well as the ultimate goal: the first national championship in the program’s five-year history.

Backlash against conservative speaker Ann Coulter’s planned visit to the University of California, Berkeley later this month demonstrates that in today’s contentious political climate, the ability to freely discuss concepts and ideas without fear of reprisal from others is waning. 
People, especially college students, tend to hide behind condemnations of unknown or feared concepts as “-isms.” Allegations of racism, progressivism, imperialism, sexism, traditionalism and other -isms are common in contemporary discourse, especially online and on campus. 
However, not everyone is content with this state of affairs. A pair of students at Harvard College recently launched a club called the Harvard College Open Campus Initiative with the goal of bringing people with diverse backgrounds and viewpoints from all over the political spectrum to speak on campus. Some on both sides of the political divide may see this as an avenue for harmful ideas to spread, while others may more fairly see this as a triumph of civility in an era of contestation. Indeed, the Open Campus Initiative ought to be universally lauded rather than condemned.
It is not always appropriate for an individual to say something provocative and then hurriedly cling to their First Amendment rights as some sort of fleeting protection against reasoned and pointed counterargument — looking at you, internet trolls. 
That isn’t what this argument is about. Very few people fear that the First Amendment is going away anytime soon. Discourse is not challenging the legal right to freedom of speech; instead, it is challenging the socially acceptability of dissent from popular beliefs. Organizations like the Open Campus Initiative exist in order to provide for respectful, civil discussion of ideas — even controversial ones — with all of the legitimacy and propriety that comes with an organized forum. It is not really a “safe space” in the commonly accepted sense; it is instead something more similar to an interest-oriented club. Except, in this case, the interest in mind is, in fact, the mind itself. 
The fact that the Open Campus Initiative has experienced protests at its events and has generated mild backlash is a testament to the fact that many students may prefer to get angry at proponents of different ideas instead of engaging with these ideas and entering into an intellectual debate. This attitude is precisely what the Open Campus Initiative is designed to reveal and to resist. It is far too easy to be dragged into self-affirmative bubbles and to seek safety rather than intellectual rigor. The Open Campus Initiative allows students at Harvard to have a space to challenge that tendency, and colleges around the nation should follow suit.
Even if students disagree with one or multiple speakers who are brought to a college campus, the presence of such figures is an asset, not — as many believe — a liability. These individuals, who often represent an ideology or school of thought, are commonly well-versed in civil discussion and respectful debate. There are, of course, exceptions to this generalization. However, the students who attend speeches by these individuals should not cast the first stone. They should instead endeavor to first understand the positions being related to them, then analyze them and finally critique them openly and respectfully. Hiding behind half-supported accusations is an asinine way of dealing with dissent, and one that heralds back to the era of the Red Scare, when vaguely different ideologies were dismissed by sweeping accusations and resulted in harsh legal retribution.
This critique, like the Open Campus Initiative’s mission, applies to people on the right and the left alike. There is only experience and knowledge to be gained through inviting dialogue, and the quicker that students understand this, the better they will be prepared to deal with the very real fact that the world outside school is not always as accommodating of their beliefs as they may like.

Free speech isn’t dead. It is increasingly yielding necessary debate. The creation of an entire student organization at Harvard focused solely on free speech is highly unnecessary and promotes the idea that free speech cannot simply be integrated into everyday conversations.
Earlier this semester, a group of students at Harvard University launched the Open Campus Initiative, the school’s first club focused on free speech. 
“We decided to seek out some method for advocating for the things that we learned and we realized that there was no group at Harvard interested in open dialogue,” club president Conor Healy told USA Today. 
This sentiment sounds nice, but it begs the question — shouldn’t every group at Harvard be interested in open dialogue? I’m sure there are not many campus organizations openly promoting their commitment to closed dialogue. 
This development demonstrates just how ridiculous the discussion surrounding free speech has gotten. People are now quick to throw out phrases like “free speech is dead” and claim that their right to free speech is being infringed upon, but the fundamental right to free speech hasn’t changed. The only thing that has changed is wider accusations against individuals violating free speech, when these individuals are simply practicing free speech for themselves.
The First Amendment states that “Congress shall make no law … abridging the freedom of speech.” As far as I know, Congress hasn’t passed any new legislation that reduced the right to free speech, so the right still exists. It is just a matter of exercising it. However, many conservatives claim that their free speech is under attack as soon as liberals push back against what they’re saying. 
It is completely understandable that many conservatives feel like they are under attack or that schools are no longer places of open dialogue, especially considering recent incidents of controversial speakers being widely protested by students, such as conservative speaker Milo Yiannopoulos at the University of California, Berkeley and National Policy Institute President Richard Spencer at Auburn University. Nevertheless, the First Amendment technically only limits the ability of Congress to legally restrict free speech. It doesn’t mean that no entity can ever exercise discretion when allowing a speaker on their property. 
Universities currently find themselves in a tricky balancing act between the desire for open discussion and the need to address students who legitimately feel threatened by certain speakers. This balance has plagued free speech since its inception; as Americans, we have the freedom to say whatever we want, until it crosses the line and infringes on the rights of others.
The Open Campus Initiative is an overreaction and negates the very purpose it hopes to achieve. There’s no need to create a club specifically for free speech; it would be more effective for the same students involved in the club to lead by example by contributing to open discussions in every aspect of their lives on campus, not just within a small group of students who chose to be in the Open Campus Initiative. 
Those who claim free speech is dying are often the same people who lambast the rise of campuses as a “safe space,” yet the Open Campus Initiative merely creates a safe space for students to speak openly without fear of someone vehemently arguing with them. If the involved students truly feel like free speech is disappearing on campuses, they should try to open the minds of students who normally would resist their ideas, instead of limiting their “open discussions” to a student group that is made up of a self-selecting group of individuals that is predisposed to be accepting of open and frank discussions. In this way, the club essentially defeats its very purpose by sectioning off into a club for free speech, instead of maintaining the expectation that free speech be a part of everyday life, and by creating yet another group of inherently like-minded individuals. 
Recent support for campus safe spaces have undoubtedly created an environment that is less than friendly to students with unpopular beliefs. However, the proper way to address this is by organically fostering open conversation at any possible time, not by specifically designating one organization as the space for these conversations.

The new club at Harvard is regularly inviting speakers to campus.  They are not, as this author suggests, huddling together in an echo chamber.
Yeah…sure…and today we learn Cal Berkeley has cancelled Ann Coulter’s appearance because of security concerns.
Yeah…sure,  Erin whatever you say.  LOL
Who taught you civics?
Because they failed you miserably.
1) No intelligent Trojan believes that racial, religious, demeaning body-shaming, gender, etc. or other hate speech should be protected. And our campus is likewise no place for insults, ridiculing, cruel speech, disparaging speech or the like. Obviously, fighting words or incitements to violence or commit foul, rude behavior likewise does not belong at USC.
2) With that out of the way, please give some examples of controversial speech which should be permitted in student debate, even in safe spaces. Please give other examples of speech not listed in paragraph 1) above, which should be prohibited in safe spaces.
3) I am not being sarcastic or pretending to be dense. I am genuinely trying to understand exactly what is intended in addressing  speech on campus to be prohibited, beyond the obvious unacceptable speech stated in paragraph 1.
Calls to violence do exist and warrant prevention.  Criticism, opinions you don’t agree with and promotion of values which are not your own do generally deserve protection.  You’ve tried a variation on the ‘No true Scotsman” fallacy.  I wish colleges still taught that kind of analysis (logical fallacies).  And dump the safe spaces, snowflake.
Good reply, Rob. In fact, I am on your side. I am not at all in favor of “safe spaces,” in fact, the idea disgusts me. I am neither liberal nor snowflake, but I mentioned “safe spaces” only in the sense of conceding that this atrocious concept has evidently become sacred and beloved by many schools. I was wondering this:  What can students talk about in safe spaces? Or in any other spaces on a campus without running into some overly protective, silly rule?
I failed to communicate; my bad. I was trying to determine what controversial discussion was acceptable at all to those who want “safe spaces,” want restricted language and want restricted subject matter. I ruled out the obvious, but was hoping to learn what other areas are forbidden as “unsafe.”
“Nevertheless, the First Amendment technically only limits the ability of Congress to legally restrict free speech. It doesn’t mean that no entity can ever exercise discretion when allowing a speaker on their property.”
This isn’t accurate. The First Amendment has been applied against the states (and state subdivisions) since the early 1900s by way of the Fourteenth Amendment. Translated out of boring-law-words, this means that the First Amendment applies to state institutions — including college campuses. (See, for example, the Supreme Court case Healy v. James, involving a leftist student club that was denied recognition by a public university because of fears that they would advocate for unlawful conduct or engage in violence.)
Then why is conservative speech shut down at so many schools? Why is conservative speech labeled as hate speech? Why are conservatives labeled as fascists when it is the left that is using fascist tactics to shut down free speech? It wasn’t conservatives which rioted at Berkeley about 6 weeks ago and destroyed property and wouldn’t allow Milo to speak. Until Berkeley I had never even heard of Milo. Why was Ben Shapiro not allowed to speak at CSULA? Why is Ann Coulter given a hard time when she tries to speak? The problem is the alt-left is afraid to let conservatives voices speak. Isn’t the purpose of a university/college to have an exchange of ideas? How can you have an exchange of ideas when only the alt-left is allowed to present their ideas? Show me an incident of violet protest by conservative students against an alt-left speaker. I can show you plenty of alt-left violence against conservative speakers. Q.E.D.

Photo courtesy of Scalla JaksoFor the love of the stage · Alumna Julie Boardman will debut as a Broadway producer for the musical An American in Paris on April 25.
Broadway has been a lifelong passion of alumna Julie Boardman, who graduated in 2004 with a bachelor’s degree in music industry. Since her first performance in a musical at the age of five, Boardman performed every chance she could, dreaming of the day when she would finally break into the elite Broadway community. Her efforts finally paid off this month with An American in Paris — Boardman’s debut as a Broadway producer.
An American in Paris, which opens on April 25 at Segerstrom Center for the Arts, is a Tony Award-winning musical about an American World War II veteran who pursues art in Paris and becomes entranced with a mysterious French ballerina. Featuring songs from music legends George and Ira Gershwin, the musical is a celebration of love and the power of art. 
“[An American in Paris] is  a traditional musical with all the singing and dancing and acting, but it still feels new and relevant, especially today with what’s going on in the world,” Boardman said.
The musical holds special significance to Boardman — not only did the Gershwins compose the soundtrack of her childhood, but she also grew up in Irvine, Calif. by the Segerstrom Center. Boardman described Paris as both escapist and relevant. She also deeply connects to its theme of the power of art, which is reflected in a line from the musical: “Life is already so dark. If you have the talent to make it brighter, to bring people joy and hope, why would you withhold that?” Boardman’s decision to become a Broadway producer is guided by this philosophy.
“That’s why I do this — to see people walking up the aisle and laughing,” Boardman said. “You’ve changed their lives, and they’ve left their troubles at the door. You see them going out, and they have a big smile on their faces and they’re singing the songs.”
Boardman considers art to be an essential part of human nature. She believes that being creative benefits the development of children, cultivating their imaginations and teaching them essential problem-solving skills. When Boardman was 15, she joined the nonprofit The Young Americans and then performed in a national tour, teaching underserved children how to sing, dance and act. The experience taught her about the ability of art to give people hope.
“Their lives were changed,” Boardman said. “They might not have had love or support at home, but you could see the power of the arts in transforming their lives.”
Boardman continued pursuing her Broadway ambitions at USC, where she majored in music industry at the Thornton School of Music. At USC, Boardman took on various internships and packed her 18-unit schedules with diverse courses in business and music industry. She claims that receiving this well-rounded education helped prepare her for her future Broadway career. Boardman also began to develop the leadership skills of a producer through her involvement in the greek system as the president of Alpha Phi.
“[It] was a really great experience running things and learning leadership skills and delegation,” Boardman said. “I learned that I didn’t have to do everything by myself and that I could trust others to do it.”
A week after her graduation, Boardman moved to New York to work at Jive Records, a company at which she had interned when she was at USC. After performing on the national tour of 42nd Street for a year, Boardman decided to become a producer because she “wanted to be the puppeteer and not the puppet.” However, becoming a Broadway producer was no easy task. 
“Broadway is a small community, predominantly run by older, white males, and it turned out that I am in the minority as a young female,” Boardman said. “However, I think I stand out and have something to say and have proved that I’m worthy to be there.”
Boardman acknowledges that she has a long road ahead of her, but she is still persevering in her goal to create new musicals based on her own ideas. This would require the formation of her own creative team and about seven or eight years of development before the show is finally ready for Broadway. However, she is optimistic about her future and encourages fellow artists at USC to continue pursuing their dreams.
“Believe in yourself and know that you can do it,” Boardman said. “Go for it and make it happen, and if you fail you probably learned more from your failures than your successes. So don’t hold back.”
Correction: A previous version of this article incorrectly stated that the performance of An American in Paris will be shown at the Segerstrom Center for Performing Arts. The venue’s name is actually Segerstrom Center for the Arts.

It is no surprise that college preparation has traditionally been restricted to children from familoes who can afford applications, counseling, tutoring for standardized tests and overall access to elite institutions. Access to higher education continues to be a widely discussed issue among millennials and lawmakers on a local and federal level. However, between discussions about tuition, standardized testing methods and privately hired college counselors, one aspect is often forgotten: the process of actually applying to college. 
Last week, the Common Application introduced a new set of changes that demonstrate its commitment to bridging the gap between different students’ ability to use the Common Application.
Elite institutions have become increasingly aware of their lower-income students’ needs. In conjunction with the tuition hikes, universities have also increased financial aid and grant programs. USC is just one example of this dedication to college access. Although there continues to be a plethora of problematic practices that elite institutions adopt, there has also been more discussion and awareness on the topic of first-generation and lower income students. 
Institutions are improving their support for low-income, first-generation students once they get to campus, but the process of getting to USC remains burdensome and difficult for students, especially those who do not have school and family support. 
One of the main changes that the Common Application recently made includes a section where students must report every class they took and the grade they received, prior to when admission officers obtain the official transcript. This doesn’t seem to have a large benefit, though the universities in the UC system and other schools, including USC, already require students to self-report grades. The more impactful changes that the system will make this upcoming cycle are Google Drive integration, adviser integration and translation to Spanish. 
The Google Drive integration allows files such as a resumes and essays to be imported directly from the Cloud system. While it doesn’t seem like a large change, this tool is incredibly crucial to students who may not have the same access to technology as their more privileged peers. College admission expert Valerie Strauss said this marks a wonderful change for students who “don’t have personal computers and rely on school and community resources to access this type of technology” in a blog for The Washington Post. Additionally, the Drive application has proven to be incredibly popular in school settings, commended for its intuitiveness and collaborative nature. Anything that makes the application process more straightforward is a move in the positive direction for the Common App. 
Key instructions and information about the Common Application will now be available in Spanish, which makes it easier for students whose second language is English, as well as parents who do not speak English to be increasingly integrated into the process. Introducing other popular languages to the platform could be an easy and effective improvement. 
Translation to Spanish has clear and necessary benefits, and the adviser integration tool has its advantages, but may also yield issues with academic integrity. This tool allows additional people to invite others to view into a student’s Common App to give them feedback, when previously, only school counselors were allowed access. 
Strauss points out that this provides increased support for students who not only lack a strong college counseling system, but also enables the Common Application to function as a group activity when its purpose is to demonstrate the merit and skill of the individual.
These changes are gradual and intentional, demonstrating that the Common App is dedicated to making the application process an easier one for all those involved. However, these are only the beginning for the changes on the Common App, and it is only the tip of the iceberg when it comes to the application process. For first-generation students whose parents adopt English as their second language, and even for those who do have family support, the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA), can still be difficult to navigate. 
One way to streamline the process for students could be to combine the FAFSA and the Common App processes, and thus simplify the entire application process. At high schools with more access to resources than others, the need for financial aid is not as dire but the college counselors at these schools are well-equipped to help students and parents work through the difficult financial aid processes. However, at schools with less economic resources, where the need among students for financial aid and for help applying for financial aid is greater, the resources are also scarcer. 
Another obstacle in applying to college are the application fees. Some schools provide a voucher option to waive the fee — but once again, this is very dependent on the school’s college counseling program. The Common App and FAFSA, once again, could work together to implement a system within their programs to give vouchers to students, regardless of their school’s competence. 
Colleges and universities should not judge students on their ability to navigate the maze that is financial aid, application fees and supplemental documents, but rather their merits as a student and a person. Simplifying this process benefits everyone involved, and the recent changes to the Common App mark a step in the right direction.

In a previous column, I gave credit to Netflix’s 13 Reasons Why for doing what high school television shows rarely do: explore the consequences of the characters’ cruelty and apathy toward each other and themselves. Instead of portraying action, 13 Reasons Why focuses on reaction — the characters’ responses toward Hannah’s suicide and the incoming revelations that they could have more to do with it than they realized.
Of course, the show’s revelation is not that Hannah commits suicide (though caution: spoilers to 13 Reasons Why ahead) — it’s why she does. That’s what the title suggests, but it’s actually more complicated than that: not all 13 reasons are equal, and when it comes to exploring teenage suicide in real life, the show vastly ignores the factor of mental illness that feels so crucial to a subject like this.
But before I begin to discuss 13 Reasons Why’s treatment of suicide, let’s first examine the way it portrays sexual assault and rape. I am always weary when a series or film chooses to graphically depict rape scenes or uses them to supply a female character’s backstory, because such triggering themes are often employed by male writers and directors just to make their female characters more maudlin. And yet, 13 Reasons Why is different: Hannah’s rape isolates the protagonist to the extent that she commits suicide, and her suicide is the inciting incident for the entire show. 
The reason most depictions of sexual assault feel gratuitous is because they are cop-outs, easy ways out for writers to accentuate trauma or backstory, and they usually include absolutely zero consequences for the perpetrators of the assault or the victims’ narratives as a whole. When there are consequences, they always almost entirely fall on the victim. 
I now realize my mistake for praising 13 Reasons Why before I had a chance to watch the series further. In a show that’s all about consequences, it soon becomes clear that the rape victim is still the one whose suffering serves as fodder for the plot. It doesn’t matter if it’s the premise, and it doesn’t matter that Hannah is a main character — the series still manages to play into the tiresome practice of exacting pain on female characters so that the people around her can experience a revelation.
From the terrified, bloodied girl running for her life in every horror movie, to the sick and dying wives of male protagonists, to the female characters given histories of rape and assault to make them more interesting: Female suffering is a trope used over and over in the history of storytelling. Though 13 Reasons Why deals with sexual assault in a way that is integral to the story, it may well mean that vast flaws lie in the foundation of the premise itself. And of course, that is not to say that female characters shouldn’t have to encounter huge obstacles. But they don’t always have to be the victims in their own stories. 
In this show, the fact that Hannah is still an active character after her death doesn’t make her suffering any more justified. In fact, this plays into a dangerous mentality surrounding suicide: that suicide is somehow a message to send, that a person’s death can make the people around them realize the extent of their misdeeds. Hannah is driven to this point because no one listens to her, but isn’t that a dangerous message to send as well? Real-life victims of assault need to realize that there are always people who can listen and help them. In this sense, 13 Reasons Why is devastatingly oblivious to young people dealing with similar struggles.
All of this is not to say that television would be better if themes of rape and suicide didn’t exist on screen. These stories urgently need to be told, and television as a form of mass communication has the unparalleled ability to instill empathy in viewers. But it’s the way these stories are unraveled, with so much disregard for who is watching, that makes me uneasy. 
When dealing with subject matter as complicated and triggering as sexual assault and suicide, filmmakers have a critical responsibility to send a thoughtful, empowering message. They owe it to the audience, and they owe it to the characters themselves.

Festival season has begun, but, not all of us will be attending the infamous Coachella and Stagecoach music festivals. So, what do you do in Los Angeles when everyone is away? You’ve come to the right place. This blog is dedicated to help you decide what to do in Los Angeles if you are not attending a music festival — with a twist.
If you love music but aren’t “festival ready”: 
For music lovers, I would highly recommend attending Coachella or Stagecoach. But the festival life is not for everyone. Instead, try a local concert such as John Mayer at the Forum on April 21st.
If you love the outdoors but not the polo grounds of Coachella Valley: 
Relax and enjoy the outdoors in Santa Monica with Run + Yoga — “ROGA.” Free on Saturday mornings, this event hosts a two and five mile run starting at the Santa Monica Pier at 8 a.m. and is followed by a 9 a.m. yoga session by the beach. 
If you would have just gone to Coachella for the food: 
Better than a Coachella watermelon, the Museum of Ice Cream opening in Los Angeles. Get your tickets now to visit the museum and have the chance to swim in a pool of sprinkles.
If you are looking for a new adventure but are trying to stay local in Los Angeles: 
Attend VRLA Expo 2017 for an entertaining and innovative experience. Located at the Los Angeles Convention Center, VRLA is the world’s largest virtual reality expo, allowing people to try hundreds of VR and AR experiences. 
If you love live performances, but prefer a theater stage over the Sahara Tent:
The Ahmanson Theater is putting on a production of Into The Woods for the month of April. 
If you really would have just wanted to go to a music festival for the Instagram:  
On April 22, the Annenberg Space for Photography in Century City is hosting a Snap Workshop, teaching the best ways to take your Instagram account to the next level, with informative sessions on how to work the business side of Instagram. 
If you want an outdoor experience but just for a day:
Spend Earth Day at Grand Park in Los Angeles. The park is hosting Earth Day LA, filled with live music and food trucks (sounds like Coachella to me?!). 
Los Angeles has endless activities to offer. To those of you attending music festivals, I wish you nothing but good times. However, for those of you like me and will not be attending the festivals this year, maybe my suggestions will spark some ideas for entertaining ways to spend these upcoming weekends.
