Libertarian presidential candidate Austin Petersen spoke to a group of USC students about his life and platform at an event hosted by the USC College Republicans Thursday night in the Ronald Tutor Campus Center International Plaza.
Before an open discussion regarding his policies and positions in the upcoming election, Petersen gave a quick summary of his upbringing in Peculiar, Missouri, and the values of hard work and a love of country that were instilled in him.
Petersen went on to pursue a career in media in New York City, where he began his work in politics advocating for Ron Paul’s presidential campaign in 2008. Petersen touted his credentials as a producer for the Fox Business network show Freedom Watch with Judge Napolitano. He said that some of the content he pushed to be featured on the show was controversial, but that his position on the program was rarely in jeopardy as long as people were tuning in.
“Fox doesn’t care as long as you get ratings,” Petersen said, discussing a particular occasion during the program’s run in which he featured the history of the pledge of allegiance.
Petersen also talked about Gary Johnson, one of his opponent’s in the Libertarian Party’s primary election. Petersen criticized his opponent and said that Johnson smokes marijuana on the campaign trail and expects to be the nominee, a hope Petersen believes was dashed once he entered the race.
Petersen questioned the donations provided to Johnson’s campaign by marijuana businesses and other companies, emphasizing the individual donations that fund his campaign and his hands-on dedication to running for president.
“I’m kind of the anti-establishment candidate in my anti-establishment party,” Petersen said.
After speaking about his career path and qualifications for the presidency, Petersen opened up the discussion to allow students to pose specific policy questions toward him.
On the question of abortion, Petersen believes he has distinguished himself as a self-avowed “pro-life atheist.”
“It confuses people, it gets them curious,” Petersen said, believing that one should take a “rational secular viewpoint” on this issue, viewing all life as important and valuable. Still, he believes this is an issue that should be decided on the state level, a sentiment echoed all throughout his discussion on policy.
Despite his enthusiasm for free trade, Petersen admitted reservations regarding the Trans Pacific Partnership, saying it would “manage trade, rather than [provide] real free trade.”
When asked by a student on how to interact and debate with more liberal-leaning classmates and professors, Petersen mentioned specific inroads that Libertarians could make with liberals, particularly with those outside the establishment, due to their similar viewpoints regarding the War on Drugs, civil liberties, interventionism and criminal justice reform.
Petersen addressed the Libertarian Party’s slim chances of reaching the White House, and why he is the best representative for its ideals.
“When you don’t have a chance at the White House, you’re sort of acting as a torchbearer for the movement. I would be able to pass the torch forward,” Peterson said.

Students met with representatives from the ONE National Gay & Lesbian Archives at the USC Libraries Thursday night in Waite Phillips Hall as part of EdMonth’s “Reclaim Your Narrative” event series. Hosted by the Queer and Ally Student Assembly, Academic Culture Assembly and EdMonth, the event centered its discussions around LGBTQ hxstory, a gender-neutral substitute for “history,” using primary documents from the expansive ONE Archives at USC.
ONE archivist Loni Shibuyama started the event by explaining that ONE began as a secret LGBTQ society, then expanded to become the first-ever magazine with the word “homosexual” on the cover. Now, ONE is both a non-profit organization and a collection of hxstory archives, of which USC Libraries boasts the largest in the nation.
With magazines and other materials from the archives in hand, students at the event discussed not only LGBTQ identity issues of the past, but how those issues are still all too real for people of marginalized identities. QuASA member Vanessa Diaz, a junior majoring in American studies and ethnicity, reflected on these difficulties as she compared the past to the present.
“Changing this system and this culture is still really important,” Diaz said. “Because even though queer identities don’t get discriminated maybe as much as they used to, people still get turned away from churches, people still get kicked out of their homes. There’s still a lot of work to be done even if we think the work is over.”
Leading the discussion, Educational Assistant Helen Aldana encouraged these modern-day connections and pushed their importance for modern LGBTQ rights movements. As a member of ONE’s Educational Department, Aldana and many others help to formulate educational materials to incorporate LGBTQ issues into regular history courses, helping students to make these historical connections sooner.
“With the curriculum, we’re hoping to have a legitimate idea what it means to be LGBTQ in our history,” Aldana said. “It’s nothing new. It’s not a hashtag. There’s always been a fight, and it’s important to show youth that so they can have that in their language.”
Panelists emphasized the importance of taking an active role in history throughout the event, especially in terms of how students can add to it themselves. Shibuyama noted that about 95 percent of USC’s ONE Archives consists of donated items and urged the students to add their own items to the collection.
“The thing that we want to have you take away from tonight is the importance of saving and documenting history, history that is being created now, and any history that you create going forward,” Shibuyama said.
The remarks of QuASA Director Alyssa Coffey echoed Shibuyama, as she discussed bringing history into the present tense.
“History is not always in the past,” Coffey said. “What we’re doing now is going to impact what is done tomorrow.”
The notion that the word “history” is gender-specific is risible. A quick Google search of the etymology of “history” puts the lie to this silly “hxstory” substitution. You guys seem to be more of a problem than a solution, and you make me despair.

Anti-Semitic flyers were discovered in university printers and fax machines at the University Park and Health Sciences campuses over the last week.
Anti-Semitic flyers were discovered in university printers and fax machines at the University Park and Health Sciences campuses over the last week, which were printed by hacker and self-defined internet “troll” Andrew Auernheimer.
Students who saw the flyer said they were horrified that both the racist image was printed and that it was being copied.
“I was astonished, and I posted a picture on my Facebook to show my friends what our society still thinks today. For the whole day I felt like there was a big rock in my stomach […] like doing the right wasn’t important,” said Cecilia Baez, a junior majoring in chemical engineering, in an email to the Daily Trojan. “After posting on other USC social climate accounts, I then heard that these flyers were actually being copied randomly and wirelessly.”
The messages explicitly discriminated against people of Jewish descent.
“White man: are you sick and tired of the Jews destroying your country through mass immigration and degeneracy? Join us in the struggle for global white supremacy at the Daily Stormer,” the flyer stated, as confirmed by student representatives from USC Hillel who witnessed the images.
Many university students and faculty found these flyers in their daily work space printers, including faculty from the Office of Religious Studies and USC Hillel who have been in communication with the Department of Public Safety and Information Technology Services in order to locate and block the sources to better ensure a similar incident cannot occur again.
“We received the fax on Thursday, which is the same day that the other universities received them. DPS and ITS worked with authorities to investigate the incident … DPS posted the message on Friday upon completion of their investigation,” said Varun Soni, dean of Religious Life, in an email to the Daily Trojan.
The Department of Public Safety commented on the incident on their website.
“USC has been made aware of the anonymous delivery of anti-Semitic messages to several networked printers at University Park and Health Sciences campus,” the statement said. “All incidents of bias, hate crimes, and hate incidents are considered a serious breach of USC community expectations and need to be reported allowing for appropriate investigation and response.”
DPS turned over the investigation to Information Technology Services security, who discovered that this was a national incident carried out by an IP address that was out of the country.
Other universities dealing with the results of the massive release include Princeton University, Brown University, University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee, UC  Berkeley, Smith College, University of Massachusetts Amherst and Mount Holyoke College, among others.

USC Marshall School of Business students Suzana Amoes, Ryan Alam and Megan Strawther were named one of the top 10 finalists of the Morgan Stanley Sustainable Investing Challenge.
The challenge aims to use finance and investment tools to address a current environmental or social problem, and provides competitive financial returns to graduate school students all over the world. Amoes, Alam and Strawther are excited for their final pitch in Hong Kong, which will take place on April 15.
This year, more than 340 students from 64 schools in 21 different countries submitted pitches for the competition.
Amoes, Alam and Strawther focused on the revitalization of land usage and productivity by eradicating landmines and creating a new class of smallholder farmers in Angola. The group named their project “Terra Limpa,” meaning clean earth in Portuguese.
The idea behind the pitch, according to Strawther, was to focus on addressing the issue of landmines, which cripple agriculture in Angola and prevent revival of the economy.
“The majority of Angola being covered in landmines is behind the lag in the country’s agricultural sector,” Strawther said. “Angola is so dependent on oil exports that there is a need to diversify the market to include agriculture.”
Strawther explained that the proposal is currently focused on providing aid to around 5,500 hectares of land, targeting three different provinces in Angola which are suitable for agriculture but are hindered by the presence of landmines. The concept of the pitch focuses on giving people more land and converting it to a productive asset, thereby adding to the nation’s economy.
“There is a [large] amount of research to be done on the pitch to explore the situation in Angola,” Alam said.
According to Alam, Amoes will visit Angola to research the landmine issue and participate in talks with the chief of the Angolan Military, the Ministry of Agriculture and local farmers. She is also researching landmines for her thesis paper and hopes to contribute her results to the pitch, according to Alam.
The three students expressed gratitude to the contest for exposing them to an array of new knowledge in agriculture and successfully fusing their business ideas to make an impact. They also attribute part of their success to their mentor Nicole Chavas, who was a previous winner of the challenge, as well as USC professors Adlai Wertman, director of the Brittingham Social Enterprise Lab, and Fran Seegull, an adjunct professor at the USC Marshall School of Business.
“At last, it’s the opportunity for the system to change and for us to change the way people think about it.” Alam said.

The undefeated Trojans continued their winning ways Thursday in a road blowout, dominating Fresno State 17-3. In their fourth encounter, the Trojans lead the all-time series against the Bulldogs 4-0.
The Women of Troy (10-0, 4-0) came out on fire, racing to a 13-0 lead when the halftime whistle blew. Junior attacker Michaela Michael anchored the team on offense, contributing 2 goals with junior attacker Cynthia Del Core contributing 3. Michael earned her fourth career MPSF honor this week, collecting Offensive Player of the Week following her commanding performance against both Dartmouth and Oregon.
However, the key to the Trojans’ offensive success is their depth. Twelve different players contributed goals, adding up to 17 total for the Women of Troy.
“Today was an opportunity where we could get every single player into the game because every single player determines our success on the field whether they’re in the game or not,” head coach Lindsay Munday said. “It’s an opportunity for everyone to see the rewards of their hard work, but it also shows our depth right now of different people being able to step up and score goals.”
In addition to a powerful offense, the Women of Troy maintained a strong defensive front to fend off the Bulldogs and limit them to just 3 goals, all of which came in the second half. For Fresno, Caro Dineen-Carlson, Lindsay Hobson and Anjelica Fuccillo each sent a ball into the back of the net. However, their efforts were unable to surpass a solid Trojan defense.
“So much of defense is communication and just working together and I think this entire season, we’ve been doing a great job of working together day in and day out in practice and in games,” sophomore goalie Gussie Johns said.
With a 13-goal advantage, it can be easy to become complacent with the lead. However, the Trojans aim to maintain a competitive mindset, regardless of the score.
“Even when a team gets up by so much, we try to stay focused as much as possible and go back to the basics and really work on what we’ve been working on in practice and try and execute it to the best of our ability,” Johns said.
Another key aspect of the Trojans’ success in a historic season is the team chemistry. With 14 seniors on the roster, the girls are comfortable playing together with three and four years of experience on the same team and they enjoy every minute that they have on the field together.
“Right now our team is playing really well together all over the field — offensively, defensively and in the midfield, the girls are really having a lot of fun with one another,” Munday said. “Their chemistry is great right now, so I think that translates onto the field.”
With 10 wins under their belt, the Trojans’ season is far from over and the girls continue to seek opportunities to improve in each contest, no matter which opponent they face.
The Trojans’ next competition is slated for April 2 at home against San Diego State.

The men’s volleyball team is hosting UC San Diego on Saturday to kick off their final homestand of the season. On Sunday, they’ll face No. 14 UC Irvine for Senior Night.
After Sunday’s match against the Anteaters, USC (6-16, 4-14 MPSF) will honor its four seniors: libero Brooks Varni, outside hitter Alex Slaught, middle blocker Tommy Leonard and middle blocker and opposite Josh Kirchner.
“It’s a little bittersweet, but I’m definitely trying to enjoy every single moment that I’m in Galen Center,” Varni said.
While all of the focus will be on the seniors on Sunday, the younger players understand that they have a part in finishing the season strong for the seniors.
“For us younger guys, we just want these seniors to go out with some big victories,” sophomore setter Jack Yoder said.
Last week, the Trojans dropped both of their matches against No. 4 Stanford and No. 6 Pepperdine in four and three sets, respectively. Despite the focused emphasis on serving in practice the week before, the Trojans didn’t perform well from behind the line last week.
Against Stanford, the Trojans served three aces and had 27 service errors — a 1:9 ratio. Against the Waves, it was much of the same. USC served two aces and committed 18 service errors. Once again, a 1:9 ratio. To put  this in perspective, Stanford had 10 aces with 14 service errors, a 5:7 ratio. Pepperdine had five aces with 15 service errors, a 1:3 ratio.
Because of their serving errors, the Trojans gave Stanford 27 points — over a fourth of Stanford’s points without the Cardinal having to do anything.
This is an issue because head coach Jeff Nygaard talked about how serving has become a huge focus for the team.
“It’s an aggressive mentality that pervades other parts of the game,” Nygaard said.
The Trojans are nearing the final stretch of their schedule. After this final homestand, they will head off to face No. 3 BYU in Utah to complete their regular season.
If USC, currently ranked No. 11 in the conference, can finish 8th in the MPSF, they will squeeze in for the final spot in the MPSF Tournament. Right now, CSUN is sitting in that final spot with a one match lead over UC Irvine and Cal Baptist and a two-match lead over USC. CSUN also holds a two match tiebreaker over USC after defeating the Trojans in both meetings this season.
Looking at the Trojans’ pair of final home matches, they’re favored over UCSD (5-19, 0-18 MPSF), who holds the last spot in the MPSF standings with no wins in conference play. Against UC Irvine (8-17, 5-13 MPSF), the match is harder to predict with the Trojans having battled them recently and gone to five sets with the Anteaters five out of the last six times they played. UC Irvine broke that streak defeating USC 3-1 earlier this season in Irvine.
The Trojans will look to finish their season at home with wins against UC San Diego on Saturday at 7 p.m. and against UC Irvine on Sunday at 7 p.m. as they make a final push to make the MPSF conference tournament and keep their season alive.
Coach Nygaard’s theory on serving is typical of the lousy job he has done this year. What possessed Haden to hire him is
beyond my knowledge of the situation. Nygaard was with Ferguson last year, and part of any problem especially recruiting
which has been sour the last two years. One impact outside hitter would have turned the program around like Murphy Troy
or Tony Ciarelli did a few years past. There is no way this team makes the playoffs finishing at BYU in Provo the following
weekend.

Last Saturday morning, I was scrolling through the ESPN app when I came across the score of the UConn-Mississippi State women’s basketball game. I thought it had to be an error: The Huskies were leading 32-4 at the end of the first quarter.
A quick Twitter search confirmed that yes, it was indeed the correct score of a game that UConn won 98-38, a 60-point rout. While the Huskies are above and beyond the best team in women’s college hoops, this wasn’t just any game; it was a regional semifinal of the NCAA tournament, and Mississippi State had a 28-7 record going in. You don’t just demolish teams in the Sweet 16 like they’re a sixth-grade rec-squad.
Three days later, UConn took some slight mercy on Texas — only beating them by 21 points to advance to the Final Four that begins this weekend — and the Huskies are well on their way to winning an unprecedented fourth consecutive national championship.
But people are unhappy about it, saying that UConn’s success is hurting the women’s game, that their dominance is turning people off.
Here are the facts: The Huskies have won 73 consecutive games, and that’s nothing compared to the historic 90-game win streak they put together from 2008-2010. This season, they are beating teams by an average of 40 points. They have made nine straight Final Fours and won five of the past eight national championships. Their head coach, Geno Auriemma, will likely win his 11th national championship next Tuesday and pass the legendary John Wooden for the all-time record.
These are transcendent accomplishments that should be celebrated. Instead, the debate this week has centered on them ruining the sport, with pundits questioning whether UConn is too outstanding for its own good.
“Hate to punish [UConn] for being great, but they are killing women’s game,” Boston Globe columnist Dan Shaughnessy tweeted after the Mississippi State game. “Watch? No thanks.”
This is as much of an indictment of women’s sports as it is of the actual issue of a team being too dominant. By Shaughnessy’s logic, every time tremendous over-achievement happens in sports — such as Wooden leading the Bruins to 10 national championships between 1964 and 1975 — it’s a bad thing.
But UCLA’s success in the ’60s and ’70s had people calling Wooden a genius, earning him the nickname, “Wizard of Westwood.” Nobody complained or stopped paying attention to men’s college basketball just because the Bruins were the favorite every year.
Examples from the NBA present a similar argument. When the Chicago Bulls made two different “three-peats” in the ’90s, Michael Jordan became a legend who helped advance the game of basketball, and head coach Phil Jackson was heralded as the master architect.
Perhaps the best present-day comparison, though, is the Golden State Warriors, who are on the verge of breaking the record for most wins in a season, set by those Bulls in 1995-1996. The Warriors entered Friday with a record of 68-7, and while they aren’t winning every game by 40 points, their point differential of plus-11.0 would rank among the top five in NBA history.
Nobody is turning off the Warriors; in fact, ratings for games are blowing up. Even during blowouts, everyone wants to see what Stephen Curry will do next. President Barack Obama called Curry the “greatest shooter [he’s] ever seen.” It is well-deserved praise for a once-in-a-lifetime player on an exceptional team.
But for Auriemma, rather than reveling in the dynasty he created, he has to defend his team to the public more often than the public gives the coach his proper due. Breanna Stewart, the equivalent of Curry in women’s hoops, hardly registers on the radar of a majority of sports fans — never mind that she is on the verge of being named the Final Four Most Outstanding Player for a record fourth straight year.
It seems like the majority of dissenters to UConn are people who don’t follow the women’s game regularly, but see the Huskies destroy the field every year at the NCAA tournament and then let loose their annual “UConn is ruining the game!” hot takes. In fact, six years ago, The New York Times ran a piece with the headline “UConn Women Are Good for the Game,” with essentially the same arguments in response to the same criticisms of Auriemma’s team as we are seeing today.
“Teams that become consistent winners and play at a certain level, fans love that, respect it,” Auriemma said in the story. “I don’t care whether it is the Yankees, the Patriots, us, whoever. To dismiss that is demeaning.”
Auriemma and the Huskies may be the primary stakeholders in this issue, but this is an unfair condemnation of women’s athletics as a whole. Praising dominance in male sports while questioning the same thing on the women’s side presents a double standard. It’s the same kind of brush back that Serena Williams receives every time she handily wins a tournament — her opponents are too weak, her physical abilities are unfair, and on and on.
The women’s game may not be at the same level of popularity as the men’s, but that’s no excuse to criticize UConn. Auriemma has worked tirelessly to build a successful program that draws the best recruits year after year and marches through a field consisting of the 64 best teams in college basketball with ease each spring. That’s hard to do at any level, at any sport. So instead of faulting him for it, let’s shut up and give him some damn respect.

Three losses in the last four games have sunk USC baseball’s season record to 11-12, the first time the team has been below .500 since dropping its first series of the regular season against North Dakota in late February. The Trojans’ most recent loss was lopsided, as Loyola Marymount visited Dedeaux Field on Tuesday night and smothered the USC bats in an 8-0 blowout.
Coming into the season, expectations for the baseball program were high, largely due to a strong bullpen that many anticipated would anchor the team. The pitching staff has struggled with inconsistency so far this spring, however, and head coach Dan Hubbs admitted that will have to change if USC is to be a serious contender in the coming months.
“We need to pitch well at the start of the game,” Hubbs said. “The starters need to give us an opportunity to get into the game and get into the flow … and that gets difficult when you give up runs quickly.”
Hubbs is currently in pursuit of his 100th career NCAA victory — all previous 99 wins have come during his three-plus years in charge of the USC program — and he will get his next crack at the century mark against Stanford, as the Trojans resume their in-conference schedule this weekend. The team also seeks its second consecutive series win in Pac-12 play: USC sits at 2-1 in the conference standings after its opening series victory over California.
Hubbs anticipated a tough set up north, as the Cardinal have been pitching well and lead the nation in defense.
“We’re going to have to hold them down because their pitching has held people down,” Hubbs said.
Stanford currently sits at 12-7 on the season. Like the Trojans, the Cardinal won their opening Pac-12 series, winning two games out of three against Washington State. They are seasoned opponents, having already gone through the gauntlet with a four-game road series against Texas and a three-game set at home versus No. 3 Vanderbilt, but Hubbs said his team will be fine if the Trojans can take advantage of Stanford’s weaknesses.
“We want to try to extend the game, separate the game a little bit because they … [have] not shown that they are a good catch-up team,” Hubbs said. “When we have a chance to get a run, we are going to go get it.”
A series win in Stanford would put USC in a great position out of the gate in the Pac-12 standings and it could also act as a springboard for the team to start playing up to its lofty preseason expectations. Hubbs stressed that the Trojans had to pitch and play defense at a higher level, but he also praised his players’ resiliency through a slightly sluggish first two months. He was especially pleased with their performance at the plate, as USC’s bats have rebounded after their early season struggles with leaving men on base.
“You’re starting to see them drive guys in,” Hubbs said. “Now we need to match the pitching with it, and maybe we can go on a run here.”
The series opener between USC and Stanford at Klein Field at Sunken Diamond is scheduled to begin at 7 p.m. Friday. First pitch for remaining games is set for 1 p.m. on Saturday and 4 p.m. on Sunday. All three tilts will be broadcast on the Pac-12 Network.

USC Concerts Committee, part of the Undergraduate Student Government’s Program Board, will host Springfest Saturday in McCarthy Quad. The event is in collaboration with the Environmental Student Assembly, Trojan Pride Committee and Special Events Committee.
An annual all-day music festival, Springfest runs from  2 p.m.  to 11:30 p.m. In the past, it has brought artists such as 2Chainz, Portugal. The Man, Walk the Moon and Katy Perry to USC.
“This is going to be the biggest and most exciting Springfest that we’ve ever produced at USC,” said Judah Joseph, Concerts Committee director. “In a way, preparation for this Springfest began immediately after last year’s. With the Welcome Back Concert to Conquest, my team and I have learned along the way, and we’ve applied that to making Springfest the best it’s ever been. From rock to hip-hop to EDM, we’re extremely proud of the diverse lineup we’ve put together for the USC student body.”
This year’s lineup does not disappoint and is set to include Los Angeles-based indie band Kid Cadaver, rapper Cozz, R&B musician Jeremih and headliner Jamie xx. Jamie xx is an electronic music artist from London who has taken off in recent years in the EDM scene. His latest album, In Colour topped the Billboard Dance/Electronic Album chart, and he recently played two dates at the Shrine Auditorium. There is more to the lineup, which will feature four more artists, but USC Concerts Committee has yet to announce the final performers on the bill.
In addition to showcasing musical artists, the event features vendors, food and art. Springfest brings in food trucks every year, with this year’s options including The Boba Truck, Border Grill Truck, Jogasaki Sushiburrito, The Grilled Cheese Truck and King Kone. In addition, this year Concerts Committee has created a new area of the festival called GREENHAÜS, a “geodesic dome” that will feature live music, yoga, meditation and more, and will act as the second Springfest stage. Performers at the second stage will be various USC DJs including Jynjo, Matt Dimona, Massi and more, and the stage will also be home to guided meditation led by BreatheSC, Geodesic Yoga and a Virtual Reality Panel among other things.
Students will need a USC ID to enter and are allowed to bring one guest with government-issued ID. McCarthy Quad will open at 1:45 p.m., and the music will begin at 2 p.m.

Femme Fatale · You Don’t Have to Like Me: Essays on Growing up, Speaking Out, and Finding Feminism is Alida Nugent’s second novel. – Photo courtesy of Penguin Publishing Group
Some weeks I find it difficult to write this column. I’m not ashamed of saying out loud that I’m a feminist, but being in a constantly combative state of mind is exhausting. Sometimes, I’m too tired to say “that’s sexist” because that invites an inevitable flood of comments about how feminists can’t take a joke. Educating people about harmful stereotypes is a noble cause, but it is also draining, especially on those days that make me question basic human decency.
Alida Nugent, author of You Don’t Have to Like Me: Essays on Growing Up, Speaking Out and Finding Feminism, accurately sums up what it means to be a feminist in the 21st century, post-women’s supposed liberation.
“Calling yourself a feminist is like making a comment on the Internet in real life: there’s always somebody who is going to disagree with your beliefs, and that person is going to express this disagreement with great passion and little digs at your life choices,” Nugent writes. “Some people won’t like you as much anymore. You will be uncomfortable and end up learning nasty truths about some people you thought you respected.”
Personal experience confirms Nugent’s claims. People look at you differently when you say, “I’m a feminist, and what you just said is hurtful to women.” Why is that, though? Is it because so many don’t understand what feminism truly is?
For my second article for this column, which reviewed Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie’s We Should All Be Feminists, most of the comments I received were negative. One user posted a meme with a picture of a woman’s face bracketed by two lines of text: “I want equality” and “But I also want special treatment.” Another user wrote, “You feminists cherry-pick, exploit and manipulate.”
It was strange because I had clearly defined feminism, which is the belief in the social, economic and political equality of the sexes.
According to Nugent, men do not like feminism because they’re afraid of being treated like women. The idea of suffering subjugation, the wage gap and other injustices committed against women is terrifying to those who commit such acts.
More importantly, some women do not identify as feminists. Whenever a classmate turns to me and says that she is not a feminist because she does not hate men, I’m certain that an angel somewhere out there is losing its wings.
“When a woman says she’s not a feminist, I always get thrown off guard,” writes a perplexed Nugent. “It’s literally for her. […] Yes. Okay. Men are great. They smell good. They play in baseball in stadiums that have good hamburgers and beers. I have no qualms with many of the men in the world! I only have qualms with men who call me babe in the middle of the conversation, men who sit with their legs spread on the subway and men who think that being good at football means you’re allowed to kill people.”
Casual degradation, manspreading and OJ Simpson? Check, check and check. Nugent is unrepentant. She does not shy away from the toxicity of the hyper-masculinity which infuses daily life. Nugent is also hilarious. You Don’t Have to Like Me is her second book, and it combines the tones of Rebecca Solnit and Roxanne Gay, both of whom are prominent feminist authors.
Like Nugent, I believe that it’s necessary to stand firmly in your beliefs despite opposition. There’s always going to be somebody who will disagree with whatever you say. I am a feminist, and I am not ashamed to say it out loud.
Noorhan Maamoon is a junior majoring in print and digital journalism.  Her column, “The Hijabi Monologues,” runs on Thursdays. 
“I only have qualms with men who call me babe in the middle of the conversation, men who sit with their legs spread on the subway and men who think that being good at football means you’re allowed to kill people.””
Pathetic. And you feminists wonder why many of us distance ourselves away from you whiny and self adsorbed professional victim hood brats.
-Some guy calling you babe is not oppressing you. That is in fact very common with men AND women–Some women also use this term in a convo with men. But how typical of you feminist to cherry pick once gain, when men say it. There is also women calling other women babe and men calling other men babe. It has nothing to do with some bogeyman male aura  threatening your security. Get over yourself. 
-Men have something called testicles an a penis. *gasp men and women are different* why do they sit liek that!??
Those who OVERLY spread their legs are just as annoying as women who place their BAGS on another seat or who place their young child who can sit on their lap in another seat that an adult can take. But of course, it is so convenient for your feminists to cherry pick like you do with everything else.
-. Football players committing crimes lie killing people out of some self entitled elite ego status has NOTHING to do with being a man or men being given that mentality. The fact that you state is ANOTHER perfect example of the negative attitudes you banshees have towards men. 
Overall, the fact that you think you need some giant and obnoxious social-political moment over THESE PETTY and INSIGNIFICANT things peaks volumes.
AGAIN you not only the DISHONESTY of you feminists, but the downright DISMISSIVELY SMUG attitude that you have.
“You feminists cherry-pick, exploit and manipulate.”
–That is a fact. How can we tell? You feminists do this with for example, the gender wage gap narrative. Which has been debunked over and over and over again.
“It was strange because I had clearly defined feminism, which is the belief in the social, economic and political equality of the sexes.”
Except that itself is a fallacy honey and you know it. Your typical elitist condescending, dismissive, smug, patronizing attitude will not work on us non feminists. We see right through you pretentious jerks.
An ideology being expressed on paper or being briefly defined through some cookie cutter deification is NOT the same as that ideology actually being enacted through laws, policies, curriculum, etc.
You feminists also fail to accept that fact that you are promoting a never ending, pathetic, unhealthy, professional victim mentality among women and girls who aren’t even oppressed.You feminists WANT US to feel bad so that we can cling to you glory-addict activists which gives you a sense of fulfillment, influence, purpose, and power. The battle has ALREADY been won here in the U.S., Canada, Denmark, Sweden, UK, etc. But you folks refuse to admit that.
I’m not ashamed of saying out loud that I’m not a feminist.

Sleepless: The Music Center After Hours is happening this Friday from 11:30 p.m. until 3:00 a.m. That’s right — a middle-of-the-night extravaganza featuring brand new spaces and plenty of activities in The Music Center’s Dorothy Chandler Pavilion, which is certainly a change of space from where usual performances are held. 
Dance the night away wearing headphones and “silent dancing” to various DJs, or under the disco ball in the Founders Room. LA Record is bringing DJs to The Music Center’s event, so come ready to dance, or at least ready to check out other’s moves. Some of the featured DJs are Money Mark, Ras G, Teebs, Sage Gaswell and Peanut Butter Wolf. Sounds of the ocean — a look at behind the scenes with video artist Carole Kim — and out-of-service photo booths are all available as unique exhibits to be enjoyed throughout the night. Vibe to music and view various projections as you chill out with friends on bean bags and pillows. They even recommend bringing your own comfy seating, as long as it’s not an actual chair. Views of downtown Los Angeles are not to be missed either. If you’re feeling hungry during the late hours, small appetizers and drinks will be available to buy. Purchase your event tickets beforehand for a discounted price of $20, or the day of the event for $30. 
This won’t be your typical night out (and in no way boring). Images from last year’s event show dim neon lights, beautiful chandeliers and a crowded room with a hip ambiance. Whether you’re a night owl, feeling sleepless on a Friday night or want to experience an intriguing music and art scene, be sure to check out this event that is like no other. 
The Music Center is located in downtown Los Angeles at 135 N Grand Ave., Los Angeles, California 90012. For even more event information or to purchase an advanced ticket, visit www.musiccenter.org/events/sleepless.

Last week, an Undergraduate Student Government Senator was disciplined in part because he helped bring a conservative writer to campus in his capacity as president of the USC College Republicans. The same week, the same group brought another conservative author to campus, sparking protests and a column in the Daily Trojan critical of the author’s rhetoric and his presence on campus.
Free speech on college campuses has been a significant part of the national conversation this school year. It has to be: It’s the logical evolution of national campus movements to increase inclusivity and foster diversity, movements which concern themselves with speech, especially hate speech, on campus. The discussion has found its way to this campus as well, filling the pages of this newspaper and other publications with arguments from all sides. Speech should not be restricted on this campus. This applies not only to speakers, but also to students and the University. Just as the University should wield its right to condemn — but not ban — speakers when appropriate, students’ right to peacefully protest should be fought for and protected to the same extent that controversial rhetoric is.
Though free speech is vital for a healthy and vibrant democracy, Trojans should also understand that hate speech — defined by the American Bar Association as “speech that offends, threatens, or insults groups, based on race, color, religion, national origin, sexual orientation, disability, or other traits” — comes with a cost. Speech designed to degrade people based on nothing more than their identities is wrong. Hate speech does not add to discourse and debate, which should be opportunities to compare and contrast differing viewpoints. Hate speech only serves to divide our communities when we should be uniting to find solutions to complex problems.
However, though hate speech is unbecoming of every member of the Trojan Family, it does not mean that USC should ban certain speakers from campus. USC is a private institution, and therefore not bound by the First Amendment in the same manner as public universities, but the University understands the value of free expression and unfettered exchange of ideas. All speakers, no matter how hateful, divisive or deplorable, should be permitted to safely present on campus, should any student group invite them for an event.
That being said, students are also well within their rights to peacefully protest speakers who do not represent their views.  The presence of DPS at the student protest outside the talk by David Horowitz did not send the message that the University supported the rights of student protest — rather, it showed students that the University was somehow worried about possible safety concerns from a peaceful protest of less than 10 college students. The University should take these controversies among students as an opportunity to make the rights of students to protest more clear.
As outlined in the SCampus policies regarding free expression and dissent, “lawful and peaceful demonstration as an expression of favor or dissent will be permitted and protected,” unless the protest becomes disruptive to university operations, incites violence or attempts to deny others of their right to peacefully express their ideas.
The policy outlines that their list of freedom of expression protections is “expected to evolve, based on experience and changes in the law.” The policies outlined to protect freedom of speech are admittedly fluid and thus, students should continue conversations about free speech on campus.  The only way to make sure the right to speech and peaceful assembly is protected is to actively engage in it.
USC as an institution should absolutely condemn those viewpoints that offend our common values as Trojans. There is nothing wrong with saying, “We don’t like what you represent” to the people that seek to degrade and divide us. And the University should use past and present controversy over speakers as an opportunity to condemn speech that endangers the well-being of students.
Free speech should only be countered with free speech. This University should continue to take a stand against intolerance, as it already does in our SCampus policies, support of academic programs and centers and especially in public statements. When it comes to free speech on campus, this means condemning hate speech  when it does not uphold the values of the Trojan family.

On Wednesday, former GOP favorite Florida Gov. Jeb Bush picked himself up, dusted off his tailored suit and turned back to public speaking after a less than stellar performance on the campaign trail, according to the Wall Street Journal.
Going into the 2016 presidential race, Bush was the GOP favorite. Third in the line of a long-established and true-blue conservative dynasty, he was the shoo-in to become the face of the Republican establishment — maybe not so easily winning the general election, but at least winning his primary.
It’s funny how things change — for him, and by association, the political opportunity of the Bush consortium. Months, donors, dinners and $130 million later, Bush sank without a trace — almost as if the nation had chosen to maintain that, even eight years later, another Bush was too soon. Bush’s embarrassingly rapid defeat evinces a larger truth: It may not be so unreasonable to say that the political preeminence of the Bush family — at least as far as national office-holding goes — is over.
The reasons for Jeb’s failure are numerous, but two are paramount. First, George W. Bush’s blunders were far too injurious to forget. And second, the politicos produced by the Bush family are not the type of candidate the existing conservative electorate seems to want.
During the initial primary debates, Jeb Bush consistently stated he was “proud” of his older brother, stating that George W. “kept us safe.” But the 43rd president, his two fruitless wars, the Great Recession and his “axis of evil” clearly were not forgotten by the American people. The very fact that moderators chose to direct precious time toward a discussion of George W.’s failures reveals two important and potentially campaign-destroying principles: First, it comes with the assumption that there is a direct correlation between the policies of George W. Bush and the performance of a hypothetical President Jeb. One wouldn’t so quickly ask, say, Ted Cruz what he thought of the last Bush administration — it wouldn’t be pertinent.
From the conservative perspective, the Bush failures are still painful, if not embarrassing. After eight years and continuing intervention in the Middle East, not every conservative is convinced that George W. made the right decision, did his best or, as Jeb suggested, kept the country out of harm’s way. Jeb Bush’s campaign was haunted by the shadows of the former Bush’s failures. He was a headache, he was a failure — and then he was a joke. Jeb’s connection to him was the first strike against his presidential bid. Even eight years later and with anti-Obama sentiment remaining high among the right, it was still not so easy to be named Bush. It was as though the country saw his run as George W.’s do-over; a second try — or a third try, maybe, for a political family that created arguably one of the worst leaders in American history. The establishment had lost its last two races; where were they to go? Back to the time of elite, traditionalist conservatives — Jeb Bush — or forward, toward a new form of conservatism: the identity-driven, ferociously patriotic, warmongering, blundering, reactionary, soundbite-heavy new wave — or, in other words, Donald Trump?
The Bush family produces candidates that are of the old front — the golf-playing, suit-strutting, pro-business and matter-of-fact conservatives like George H.W. Bush once was. The new wave of celebrity politicians we’re seeing their electorate scream for — bombastic and narcissistic Trump, self-righteous and awkwardly patronizing Cruz — does not include what one might be tempted to call real politicians. Even the new youth of the family, one Texas state politician, hardly fits the profile.
What the Bush loss most clearly signifies is that the rug was pulled out from under him — the rules around appealing to the electorate and operating within the establishment all seemed to change. Like a black animal in a snowy environment, the conservative ecosystem has de-selected the Bush brand of candidate. It’s a natural part of what Mike Huckabee wouldn’t call evolution.
The changing environment of conservative politics may have all but ended the political trajectory of the Bush family, at least on a national level — Southern state politics and our politico-economic iron triangles aside. Will Jeb be the last of what we’ll see from the Bushes? The last election would suggest it so.

Now more than ever, social media has achieved ubiquity. While there are so many different platforms on which to communicate, each platform features its own unique sense of character and usage. Whether it’s Instagram for visuals and aesthetics, Snapchat for funny and real moments with close friends, YouTube for comedy and tutorials or Facebook to share articles and keep in touch with people, our choice in social media is slowly becoming a way to not only communicate with one another, but also to define who we are.
Tumblr, however, is the one social media site that differs from them all. While it has the social appeal of Facebook, the aesthetics of Instagram and the humor of Vine and Snapchat, the site has the one thing that the others don’t — anonymity.
The charm of anonymity is that, unlike with every other social media site, the user’s personal identity isn’t defined by every single post made. Consequently, it’s where social awkwardness is welcomed, vulnerability is applauded, self-deprecating humor is the norm and pop culture and social justice issues are discussed endlessly.
Through reblogging, a function where user can repost the content of another user onto their own blog with access to add comment, in addition to liking, Tumblr gives users the ability to spread and exchange ideas in such a new way while reaching a huge platform of people. No longer just limited to our inner circles, this kind of interconnectedness sets Tumblr apart. Unlike Facebook or Instagram, Tumblr provides no contest for the most thumbs up or double taps. Reblogging allows users to appreciate and bask in each other’s collective genius without the feeling of competition.
The counting of these reblogs, likes and comments is compiled in “notes,” which show up on the bottom of each post, indicating how many people interacted with the post. Content that is reblogged can often reach users from all over the globe. People are able to build lasting bonds with complete strangers, some from different countries, over similar views and values in a safe place. Someone you have never met in real life can know more about you than your family and friends, without even knowing who you really are.  “Imagine a joke whispered in biology class getting a laugh from a city the size of San Francisco. That’s Tumblr.” says Elspeth Reeve of The New Republic.
According to data from Priceconomics, Tumblr is the number one source for popular website Buzzfeed’s most visited content. Buzzfeed’s most viral story in 2015, a post on whether or not a dress was blue-and-black or white-and-gold, originated from Tumblr. The fact that one of the most successful websites and largest source for viral content in the country is dominated by mostly teenagers says a lot about millennial ability to be leaders in the curation of digital content and community.
On Tumblr, those who don’t know each other on a personal level are faced less with the fear of being scrutinized by their peers. Users benefit from the ability of being able to post a picture of whatever they want and not have to worry about aunts or cousins seeing it, moms calling to ask the reason behind it or classmates gossiping about it. One can be whomever they wish — they could create multiple accounts for specific personas. Whether it’s a community for those who identify as LGBTQ to discuss their shared experience, fandoms of One Direction to make gifs or memes about the latest music video, an audience for anime fan-fiction writers, poets or a forum for those recovering from mental illness or addiction, there’s something for everybody.
Millennials are so overly concerned with the maintenance of their social media personas and the presentation of a successful, joyful life today that it is absolutely refreshing to be in an online community that not only celebrates vulnerability but is able to turn those situations into humor. Tumblr, the virtual world of memes, feminism, social justice, fashion, social justice, art and comedy, serves as a safe haven where one can explore and cultivate their genuine self with an anonymous community of strangers who support each other as they are. If all other social media platforms could evolve into platforms where people can feel valued for their identity rather than the image, then the world would be a better place.
It’s an awful, hellish website for sex predators, underage sex workers, and on-line scammers. Don’t know why anyone would want to buy it after Yahoo finally tanks.

If you live in Los Angeles, you’ve probably heard of bubble tea — or boba as they call it here in SoCal. It’s a cold, sweet drink with a creamy tea base and chewy tapioca pearls at the bottom. This trendy drink comes in hundreds of flavors. It is typically made with a black or green tea flavor and is customized with flavorings like honeydew, almond, Thai tea, mango or coconut (to name just a few). Luckily for us USC students, Los Angeles has a wide selection of places serving this satisfying drink. Below are six of the best options around campus. 
This restaurant not only offers delicious and affordable bubble tea, but it’s also a very short walk from USC’s campus. It is one of the closest places to get your boba fix. Students say their favorite boba flavors include jasmine milk tea and mango black tea.

Many USC students frequent Urth for its delicious breakfast pizzas, coffees and omelettes. But did you know they also serve fantastic boba? Next time you’re at Urth Caffé for a Sunday brunch, order a matcha green tea boba and see what you think!

Emily Goldberg| Daily Trojan
Last week, admissions letters for USC’s class of 2020 were sent out. Cardinal and gold envelopes were mailed all around the country — even around the world, and hopeful applicants tore them open to see if they had received an invitation to become a Trojan. Admission to USC’s freshman class was more selective than ever this year. Only 16.5 percent of applicants were accepted. The average unweighted GPA was a 3.84, and 44 percent of applicants scored in the 99th percentile on standardized tests, according to Admission Center data released last week. If I applied today, I’m not sure if I would have gotten into USC. 
When the end of March 2012 rolled around, I remember the feelings of being overcome with simultaneous excitement, anxiety and dread each time I opened the mailbox or cautiously refreshed my email inbox. Only months earlier I had been rejected my from my top choice school, Northwestern University, where I had applied early decision.  
While I was going through it,  fall semester of my senior year of high school was the most stressful time of my 18-year-old life. I spent hours toiling away on my Northwestern application, hoping that I could get into a school that always seemed just out of my reach. When the decision email came in December, and I found out I had not been accepted, I was heartbroken. I felt like I poured so much time and energy into that one application and had already imagined the next four years of my life in Evanston, Ill. 
Even more overwhelming at the time, was the fact of knowing that now I would have to wait months before I knew where I would spend the next four years of my life. What I didn’t know then, was that the process didn’t have to be so stressful. 
In the end, I landed at a school that was a great fit, even if it was a fit I did not expect.  USC wasn’t even on my radar until I went into full panic mode when I was rejected from Northwestern. Through this experience I learned that something good (albeit unexpected) often comes out of what seems like the “worst” situations. I’m trying to keep this in mind as I embark in the next major transition in my life — out of college and into the real world.  
Since my senior year of high school at age 18, to senior year of college at age 21, not everything has played out as expected (actually, very few things have) but I’ve learned that nearly everything happens for a reason. I’ve learned to make the unexpected or undesirable situations work, and most often, come away from the experience having gained something. 
When I think back to senior year of high school I remember how I imagined myself at a multitude of schools, none of which were USC. Yet now, I know how important USC has been to how I have grown as a person in the past four years.
Just like four years ago when I was staring at my first college rejection letter, a lot of aspects of my future are unknown right now. However, soon enough, I know that all the pieces of the puzzle will come together and hopefully the next four years don’t go by quite as fast as the past four years already have.

The men’s basketball team has already lost one starter and two bench players, and now they may be down one of their most versatile pieces.
Guard Julian Jacobs, who just finished his junior season at USC, told the Los Angeles Times that he will declare for the NBA draft. He has not hired an agent, though, which allows him to return to school if he chooses.
The Vertical reports that Jacobs told head coach Andy Enfield of his decision on Wednesday and that he is projected to be an early second round pick.
Jacobs was one of the primary ball handlers and a jack-of-all-trades for the Trojans. He averaged 11.6 points, 4.9 rebounds, 5.5 assists and 31 minutes a game as a starter, serving as an athletic and experienced presence in the backcourt.
Jacobs was also named to the Pac-12 All-Conference First Team, the first representative from USC to receive the honor since Nikola Vucevic in 2011.
Earlier this week, redshirt junior guard Katin Reinhardt, redshirt junior forward Darion Clark and sophomore forward Malik Martin announced their intentions to transfer.
Losing Jacobs would be a major blow to the Trojans, who are bringing in several talented recruits, including guards Jonah Mathews and De’Anthony Melton. But replacing two veteran starters will be a tall task for a program looking to build upon a surprisingly successful 2015-2016 season that included their first NCAA tournament berth since 2011.

Pentatonix became famous after debuting on the Sing Off show, winning our hearts while they were at it. They’ve taken the a capella world by storm with their incredible arrangements, beautiful voices and stunning talent since 2011. With their upcoming show at the Microsoft Theater on May 1, here are a few ideas for a playlist to get you pumped for what should be the show of a lifetime. 
As if this song wasn’t totally adorable to begin with, the group ads another level and groove to this cover. Also watch the music video, it will make you incredibly excited for their performance abilities. 
Classics will always be classic for a reason, and the Pentatonix crew does M.J. justice with their stunning rendition of many of his famous songs. 
Their killer voices add a new level of eerie techno-vibe to some of this electronic artist’s greatest hits.
A favorite song hits a second time with a new twist. The beatboxing adds an even more exciting layer to this performance. 
I’ll say it: They did it better than Ariana!
This is a true favorite of mine. The group’s strong male vocals and singular, lilting female voice combine perfectly for this song. 
This mashup might be one of their most flawless — a huge feat for two electronic songs! 
A Pentatonix original off their album, this song is a great pump up and sing-along. 
Another original, this song has great groove. It really shows the diversity and the dynamics within the group. 
This song off their album has a definite different vibe, incorporating alternative sounds and even a hint of some electronic influences. 
The group hits a peak with this haunting ballad. This song is the perfect complement to their typically strong and upbeat dynamic. 
Another original by the group, this song is a perfect ender for any playlist. It’s haunting, exciting and brilliant. This song is a perfect representation of the group’s talent, individuality and musical ability.
