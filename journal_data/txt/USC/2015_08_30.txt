If you haven’t yet seen the biggest blockbuster rap hit right now, I highly suggest heading straight to the theaters. This summer’s Straight Outta Compton is the biggest thing in the music world right now along with the release of Dr. Dre’s new album Compton.
Although the rappers and producers that originally started NWA and later went on to various solo careers have been quite famous since the early ’90s, “gangster rap” is coming back in a whole new way. Not only did Straight Outta Compton portray the artistry, genius and tragic struggle behind these group of friends, it painted a vibrant picture of the lucrative diversity within the music industry.
Compton back in the late 1980s was a tough place where a couple of bright, talented individuals started their music career. Despite the struggles of coming into the music world as supposed “gangsters” these men were able to highlight one of the most important and influential genres. People from all walks of life love the beats Dr. Dre throws down and the crude but brilliant lines of Ice-Cube. The ’90s began a trend that has been revived and reborn with the release of this brilliant movie.
The brilliance of these musicians is even more seen in the release of Dre’s newest album Compton that has been received along the side of this movie. His songs paint a vivid picture of the tough times he’s faced featuring artists like Kendrick Lamar. His album drop was a huge industry move considering it was his first in 16 years.
Between the movie and the album, the industry is swarming with the revival of this lost but not forgotten genre. NWA’s first album, from which the movie took its title, has hit the Itunes charts as a top seller alongside Dre’s new release. Everywhere in the streets you can hear the melodious words of Ice Cube, Eazy-E and the other members of NWA.
The success of the movie as well as Dre’s album in conjunction with the revival of gangster rap goes to show the significant amount of influence media has on the music industry. The lucrative path of combining several mediums of entertainment to start a movement within the music world has presented an outlet for future revivals. Straight Outta Compton will go down in history as bringing the swagger of the streets to the 21st century.

Sari Castro | Daily Trojan
Hey there, Trojans!
It’s about 90 degrees outside, and the sunny California sky is as blue as it gets. But summer as we know it has officially ended. It’s time to get our heads out of the clouds, and back into Trojan nation to start the new semester. The first few lectures may not be the toughest — though some professors may try to freak students out by detailing the hundreds of pages you’ll have to read and write during the semester — but besides school, there is one thing some of us, are a little hesitant about.
After many apartment-hunting months, my roommates and I finally found the one. We got the apartment: the bed, the desk, the couch, and we thought that since we’re old enough to have our own place we’re old enough to feed ourselves. Sure that’s doable, but how!? Are we going to end up gaining weight, wasting our money on food we don’t eat or eating fast-food all the time?
You may be asking yourself the same questions, and I can reassure you the answer will be no if you follow thee tips:
In order for you to make food, you need something to cook.
FRIDGE ESSENTIALS
You will need some utensils and containers:  
PANTRY ESSENTIALS
When food shopping:
Go early in the morning
It’s always a good habit to go grocery shopping in the morning. I know it can be a hassle, but if you get up super early you’ll be able to take your time when choosing what to buy. There won’t be that many people at the line, and you’ll get back home early and be able to take a nap. If you get up late, yeah you would have slept, but you’ll realize that you’re not the only person who doesn’t like to get up early and goes grocery shopping on weekends…
Buy what you will eat not what you think you should eat
When choosing your meats think about what you’re actually going to eat. For example, I only like eating steak if it is really thinly cut and super well done, so I only buy chicken or salmon at school since it’s easier to make. For chicken it’s a lot easier if you buy chicken tenders. They’re already cut into smaller pieces and they’re boneless (this will be useful for the next step), but that’s a personal preference. Also look for organic chicken that has not been treated with preservatives.
Smart storing 
After you get back from the supermarket, take your meat and your airtight bags. Unwrap the meat, and cut it into smaller portions. Place the portions in the airtight bags and put them in the freezer. Remember to put the bag in the fridge the night before you cook. This way it will defrost. You know your stomach better than anyone so estimate how much meat you’ll eat per meal. It’s also good to cook at night and take the leftovers for lunch, so calculate for twice your usual amount.
These are just a few tips to get you started on this journey, there’s a lot more to it, but let’s take it one step at a time: Basics first.

A documentary film produced by a team of students from the School of Cinematic Arts was named a 2015 Student Academy Award winner by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences on Aug. 25.
The documentary, Looking at the Stars, follows the story of the dancers at the world’s only ballet school for the blind: the Fernanda Bianchini Association of Ballet and Arts for the Blind in Sao Paulo, Brazil.
The film’s director, Alexandre Peralta, a native Brazilian and USC M.F.A. graduate, said that he felt the recognition was an honor and an opportunity.
“When I heard [that the film had won], I was really excited,” Peralta said. “I called my whole family because [everyone] had been so involved in the making of the film and all of the stresses that came with it.”
Peralta’s documentary is the 32nd USC student film to receive this honor since the Student Academy Awards’ inception in 1972, and the 12th in the documentary category. Previous USC winners include renowned filmmaker Robert Zemeckis, who graduated from the School of Cinematic Arts in 1973.
Peralta said that the film school helped make the project possible by providing equipment, instruction, and funding, including a $10,000 grant from the Charles and Lucille King Family Foundation.
“My mentor [at USC] has been supporting the project since the beginning,” Peralta said. “Before USC, I had no film experience, so the school definitely helped make Looking at the Stars possible.”
A team of 13 students and alumni worked together on Looking at the Stars, including
producers Alexis Morrell, Sabrina Chammas, Katrelle Kindred and cinematographers
Alejandro Ernesto and Guan Xi.
The team worked together over a period of three weeks in 2013 to film the ballet dancers at the Fernanda Bianchini Association of Ballet and Arts for the Blind, interviewing both students and instructors as well as filming the dancers’  performances.
Throughout the filming process, the team faced many challenges, including the difficulties of being in a new environment and balancing many tasks.
“We had a lot of little challenges, but our biggest challenge was that it was my first time [directing],” Peralta said. “I had been an editor before, so I had to get used to wearing a different hat, so to speak.”
Furthermore, the language barrier proved to be an obstacle once filming began.
“No one [on our team] spoke Portuguese, so I had to serve as translator at times,” Peralta said.
The difficulties continued after filming was completed, with financing forming the main obstacle. To fund the initial stages of the project, including filming and travel expenses, the team used  crowdfunding website Kickstarter to collect donations and successfully raised $17,090 from 433 backers. Though this helped get the project off the ground, Peralta and the rest of his team are asking for further donations in order to pay for immersive sound design, picture editing, music composing, color correction, transcription and subtitling (in English and Portuguese), screenings and distribution.
The film’s portrayal of the ballet school’s talented and determined dancers has been hailed as a “motivational and inspirational documentary” by HBO and the National Association of Latino Independent Producers.
NALIP presented Looking at the Stars with the 2013-2014 Documentary Filmmaker Award.
The documentary focuses on portraying the girls’ desire to be known and appreciated for their skills in ballet, rather than defined by their disabilities.
The Academy granted Student Academy Awards to 14 films in five categories, selected from among 1,686 submissions that included films from 282 U.S. and 93 international schools. Eight of the 14 winners were from California schools, including Chapman University, the California Institute of the Arts, Academy of Art University, Stanford University and the American Film Institute. The winners will spend a week at the Academy in Beverly Hills before a ceremony on Sept. 17, where the levels in each category (bronze, silver and gold) will be announced.
Peralta’s film is now automatically eligible to receive an Academy Award in the short film category. The 2016 Academy Awards will take place on Feb. 28 at the Dolby Theatre in Hollywood.
This post has been updated to include additional team members’ roles in creating the film.

Clean living · Students visited booths tabled by organizations selling products that strive to be environmentally conscious. No Tox Life was at the event selling vegan handcrafted skincare products. – Elyse Wang | Daily Trojan
The Environmental Student Assembly hosted its fall kickoff event, “In Your Backyard,” Saturday to raise awareness about environmental efforts in the community.
The event, which took place in McCarthy Quad, lasted from 12 p.m. to 3 p.m. and showcased a variety of speakers, from faculty and student groups to local non-governmental organizations.
“In Your Backyard” featured two faculty guest speakers — Professor Robert Perry and Professor Ed Avol. Perry, a professor of urban plant ecology at the School of Architecture, spoke to students about gardening in semi-arid environments. Avol, a professor in the Department of Preventative Medicine at the Keck School of Medicine of USC, talked about the effects of automotive pollution on respiratory health.
Avol urged students to take charge of the future of the environment.
“We’ve seen, by studying children growing up in California over the last 20 years, that as the air has gotten cleaner … children’s health has improved,” Avol said. “That says that doing something makes a difference and makes a difference in your lifetime.”
Students were able to enjoy music by Adventure Band, formerly known as The Neighbors, as well as free food provided by Amazebowls, Chichen Itza, Azla Vegan and Border Grill. Chichen Itza and Azla Vegan are both housed inside Mercado La Paloma, a community marketplace and food court located near USC on Grand Avenue.
“Mercado La Paloma is a very unique space,” ESA Executive Director Ahlia Bethea said. “There’s delicious food, they have an amazing space for you to do your work [and] just hang out, and you can rent spaces back there for film screenings — it’s a really valuable resource that’s filled with culture.”
Students also had the opportunity to visit booths set up by organizations like the Fisher Museum of Art, whose upcoming environmentally conscious exhibits “Gyre: The Plastic Ocean”  and “Cynthia Minet: Beast of Burden” are scheduled to open Sept. 2.  Other groups included No Tox Life, which sells vegan handcrafted skincare products and Community Service Unlimited Inc., a nonprofit that promotes urban farming and food justice.
“The whole purpose behind the event was to really bring local issues to students’ doorsteps,” Bethea said. “They can just stop for some good food and hear  speakers talk to them about actual issues going on a couple steps away from campus and even on this campus.”

Pac a punch · Pac-12 student government leaders discussed university issues and figured out how to best tackle initiatives at the conference. Workshops and discussions were held in the Ronald Tutor Campus Center. – Jessica Zhou | Daily Trojan
Undergraduate Student Government hosted the third annual Pac-12 Student Leaders Summit from Friday to Sunday.
The summit was created in 2013 by the University of Utah with the aim of furthering networking and communication between Pac-12 Schools.
USG President Rini Sampath pitched the idea of hosting the event during last year’s summit at Washington State.
“Last year, when I went to the summit as vice president, I pitched the idea of USC hosting the conference because I love the idea of hosting an event which could not only elevate the prestige of student government here at our university, but it’s an opportunity for us to connect with other student governments and learn from them,” Sampath said.
The summit hosted representatives from every university student government in the Pac-12 except for University of Arizona, Arizona State University and University of California, Berkeley. Despite the absence of three schools, the conference had the highest overall attendance of any Pac-12 Summit so far.
Stanford University Student Body President John-Lancaster Finley, whose school was attending the summit for the first time, attributed this high attendance to how USG members successfully networked with the other schools and made attending the summit a priority.
“My vice president and I went to the national summit at the White House, and that’s where I met Rini,” Finley said. “Rini really pushed [the summit], and I was like, ‘Okay, I’ll be there.’ I probably wouldn’t have gone if I didn’t have a personal relationship with Rini.”
Finley also cited that the current lack of conference communication within the Pac-12 as a major reason he wanted Stanford to attend the summit this year and in the years that follow.
“Next year, I’m going to make sure whoever is my successor comes to [the summit] because I think it’s hugely important,” Finley said. “Especially because we have literally zero conference interaction, which I know other conferences do pretty strongly. In the Pac-12, we’re leaders in pretty much all other areas a conference can be a leader in, but in collaboration among the different schools not so much, and I think it’s very exciting to see that as a possibility.”
The weekend contained a large variety of activities in order to foster communication between the student leaders. Activities included workshops on topics such as marketing, sexual assault prevention and diversity where different student governments could share their unique experiences.
University of Utah Student Body President Ambra Jackson stated that it was activities like these that she found the most useful since it gave her the chance to learn how other universities dealt with similar issues in different manners.
“I would say the most enlightening part [of the summit] is just learning about what campus issues are more relevant to everyone else — for example, mental health,” Jackson said. “On some campuses they have more resources. [We learned] about those differences and how each student leader works with his or her administration to combat those in a proactive manner.”
Athletic Director Pat Haden and Unruh Institute of Politics Director Dan Schnur delivered keynote speeches at the summit. In his keynote speech, Schnur expressed admiration for the event and how he saw student leaders from all of the attending schools making a change by being involved in their respective student governments.
“Most old people would tell you that you represent the next generation of leadership, and I don’t think they realize exactly how condescending and patronizing that sounds,” Schnur said.  “I would suggest to you that you’re not the next generation of leadership. You are the current generation of leadership. You have already assumed these responsibilities not just on your campuses, but in your surrounding communities. And rather than needing to be told by some 50-year-old white guy that someday it‘s going to be your turn — it is your turn.”

Sark’s slip up · Head football coach Steve Sarkisian has been the topic of national discussion following his inappropriate behavior at Salute to Troy. He said it was a result of mixing alcohol and medication. – Mariya Dondonyan | Daily Trojan
When the news broke last weekend about coach Steve Sarkisian’s behavior at Salute to Troy, I laughed. At first glance, it seemed pretty harmless and comical and, frankly, not that big of a deal. The jokes were easy, including my personal favorite: Sark shouldn’t be expected to finish drinks or speeches if he can’t even finish a second half. I actually appreciated what he said; a coach with fire and a rah-rah attitude is rarely a bad thing.
Then the event became a national news story, and it wasn’t as funny anymore. At that point it was just troubling. A week later, and it seems the only ostensible punishment Sarkisian received was a public scolding from Athletic Director Pat Haden and some up-downs from the football team. While the thought of a coach having to go through a series of up-down drills is pretty hysterical, it’s simply not enough.
This has nothing to do with calling out Sark for possible issues with substances or anything of that nature. I doubt he is the only coach who celebrates big victories with a couple of drinks. When it is in private, that seems normal and fine. The issue is with his judgement, which is not befitting of a coach at the helm of the USC program.
You learn in ninth grade health class not to mix prescription medicine and alcohol. So what was he thinking when doing that at one of the most popular and important rallies of the year? Plenty of students drink at USC. Yet, the grand majority of us would have the impulse control and self-discipline to avoid mixing alcohol with meds at any important or professional event. How is a grown man, who is supposed to steward a program full of teenagers, reckless enough to do that in public with cameras everywhere?
Everyone makes mistakes, and most are entitled to a second chance. I’m sure an argument could be made that what Sark did was a fireable offense and that might have merit, but I don’t think he should lose his job. However, he should absolutely be suspended without pay. That would send the right message from Heritage Hall.
Taking the head coaching job at USC comes with scrutiny and pressure. This isn’t Montana State, so if you mess up, you are going to end up on both ESPN and TMZ. There are higher expectations here and also a pretty substantial paycheck to help alleviate some of the stress the job might bring home. If a coach can’t handle that or embarrasses the program nationally, he shouldn’t be the coach -— plain and simple.
Coaching at USC is more than X’s and O’s. Lane Kiffin didn’t understand that, and he found himself in the wrong airport hangar. It doesn’t seem like Sark understands that either. Not to mention, he didn’t exactly wow anyone with his in-game management last year anyway.
The one thing Sark can do better than most is recruit, but that may take a hit now. I doubt parents are going to be so gung-ho about sending their kids to L.A. when there is a national perception floating around that our coach parties harder than the players.
What about the recruits who come from heavily religious backgrounds and have an aversion to alcohol? How is Sark going to compete with the likes of Nick Saban and Urban Meyer when the first thing parents are wondering about is his sobriety? I’m sure USC will still recruit very well, especially if they win this year, but this certainly puts a chink in the armor.
Secondly, how will Sark discipline any student athlete with substance abuse problems when he wasn’t suspended himself? Though there are admittedly plenty of distinctions between a student and a professional in terms of conduct and rules, I doubt a student athlete will acknowledge the differences if he misses a game since Sark walked away scot-free. On a team full of college-aged students, this situation is bound to arise.
The one caveat to all of this is that winning cures everything. If the Trojans are able to live up to their immense potential, this will become a footnote for the season. However, I’m honestly afraid that Sark is not a good enough coach to ensure that happens. Though USC may win most games because of the huge discrepancy in talent, thanks to Sark’s recruiting prowess, when faced with a team of equal merit, we do not have the coaching edge.
I hope I’m wrong. I will gladly swallow my words if it means winning a Pac-12 and national championship, but nothing in Sarkisian’s track record indicates that will happen. And when it doesn’t — and USC has a couple of losses in their record — you can be sure that the topic of Sark’s drinking will be brought up again. That is a distraction the program simply does not need.
USC is an elite program that needs an elite coach, not just on the field and in the living room of recruits, but also in the public eye as well. It’s simply not good enough to fulfill some of these criteria; the Trojans need someone who fulfills them all because those are the coaches who build dynasties. Unfortunately, Sark has yet to show he can do that. Let’s hope that changes moving forward.
Jake Davidson is a junior majoring in accounting. His column, “Davidson’s Direction,” runs Mondays.
Good perspective, Jake.
We don’t know what Pat Haden told Sark, but you can be sure a Sark is most likely going to be let go after the season if we do not win the Pac12 South. The team is so full of talent, there e is no reason to not win the south and contend for the Pac12 Championship. Sark’s coaching and his staff’s prep work will,be the key to success. Time will tell.
Sark was not on the “Coaching Hot Seat” prior to him embarrassing the school and the program – but he is now.  He better win a bunch of game (at least 11) and run a squeaky clean and totally honorable program or he should be out.

Bouncing back · Senior forward Jamie Fink and the Women of Troy rebounded from a loss to Florida State with a 2-0 win over UC Riverside. – Brian Ji | Daily Trojan
After losing to Florida State on a last minute goal, the women’s soccer team beat UC Riverside 2-0 on Friday. Their record improves to 2-1.
The win was especially significant because the Southern California region is a soccer hotbed, with Pepperdine and UCLA also ranked in the top 25. The Women of Troy currently claim the No. 17 rank in the country, and their stock is rising.
With a goal difference of plus-two and excellent strength of schedule, the team’s resumé is shaping up nicely.
Head coach Keidane McAlpine made some crucial personnel decisions for the game, bringing on Mckenzie Taylor and Sydney Johnson in the second half. Taylor opened the scoring on 75 minutes before Johnson sealed the deal just 12 minutes later.
The underclassman duo of Taylor and Johnson helped the team find the back of the net, but McAlpine deserves the assist for making the adjustments.
The Women of Troy are striking the ideal combination of getting consistent play from the starters while also having a number of impact players who come off the bench and contribute.
In the season opener against Texas Tech, Hailey Hite subbed in and scored the lone goal to give the Women of Troy the win. Against UC Riverside, two substitutes scored to help the team to victory.
Before the clash with UC Riverside, McAlpine explained that he wanted to get more players involved in the action.
“Trying to deepen the bench a little bit — add a few more players to the rotation — I think that is going to be important to our longevity,” he said.
Deepening the bench proved effective against Riverside, as Taylor and Johnson served as catalysts and ultimately made the difference on the scoreboard. Friday’s game was the season debut for both Taylor and Johnson.
Their play complemented that of starters like midfielder Morgan Andrews, a transfer from Notre Dame who logged six total shots on the day. Two were on target and one just missed.
Through her positive play, Andrews has established that she ought to be a go-to option in the final third. The offensive machine averages four shots per game and looks poised to notch her first goal sooner rather than later.
The defense held yet again, and goalkeeper Sammy Jo Prudhomme added her second shutout in three contests.
Senior forward Jamie Fink is pleased with the strides the team is making at the defensive end.
“As the saying goes, defense wins championships,” Fink said. “In the preseason and even in spring, we have been focusing on our defensive tactics and what we need to do defensively.”
This steady play from Prudhomme and the back four will be crucial in the team’s next two games, as the Women of Troy will take on two elite opponents in North Carolina and Duke. Both the Tar Heels and the Blue Devils are ranked in the top 25.
The Women of Troy have two wins and a loss as they prepare for their trip to Durham at the end of the week.

Easy, breezy Bricio · Senior outside hitter Samantha Bricio led the Women of Troy with 24 kills and 18 digs in the win over North Carolina. It was her first double-double of the season, and the team went on to win the tournament. – Brian Ji | Daily Trojan
Opening weekend could not have gone better for the No. 22-ranked USC women’s volleyball team. Three teams came to the Galen Center Friday and Saturday to partake in the annual Women of Troy Baden Invitational, and it was USC (3-0) that came out on top. The Women of Troy hosted two Top-15 teams, No. 7 North Carolina and No. 11 BYU, while Chicago State rounded out the field. But by Saturday night, USC was the only team left undefeated.
In the season opener on Friday against North Carolina, USC displayed a new offense that stumped the Tar Heels, allowing the Women of Troy to notch their first upset win of the season with a four-set victory (25-20, 23-25, 25-18, 25-11).
Senior outside hitter Samantha Bricio led USC with 24 kills and 18 digs to notch her first double-double of the season and added an ace and five block assists. However, it wasn’t just Bricio who contributed to the win.
On the right side, sophomore opposite Brittany Abercrombie tied her career-high of 13 kills on a .367 hitting clip, while adding five blocks. Three freshmen also came into the game and saw a lot of action, led by setter Baylee Johnson. The Dayton, Ohio native earned the first start of her career and finished with 30 assists and 11 digs to tally her first                          double-double. Defensive specialist Victoria Garrick also nabbed her first-ever start, providing solid defense in the back row to finish second on the team with 14 digs, while outside hitter Alyse Ford recorded 10 kills in her first college game.
USC’s upperclassmen made an impact as well. Senior middle blocker Alicia Ogoms finished with 10 kills on a .600 hitting clip, while adding seven blocks (one solo); junior Elise Ruddins made her debut at middle blocker and added five kills and seven blocks (one solo); junior libero Taylor Whittingham had 13 digs and two aces; and junior setter Alice Pizzasegola added 27 assists.
This was USC’s fifth straight     season-opening victory, as USC avenged its only loss to the Tar Heels, which came during the second round of last year’s NCAA Tournament.
It was a quick turnaround on Saturday morning for the Women of Troy, who had a matchup against Chicago State at 10:00 a.m. It was the first-ever meeting between the two schools, but the Cougars would prove to be no match for the Women of Troy, as USC completed a         three-set sweep (25-17, 25-15, 25-19).
Bricio led the way with nine kills and three service aces for a match-high 12.0 points, while Abercrombie hit .385 and added six kills. The freshman Ford was perfect on the day, adding six kills on nine swings for a stellar .667 hitting percentage.
Sophomore transfer Niki Withers saw her first extensive minutes in the cardinal and gold, hitting .455 with seven kills and a block, and setters Pizzasegola and Johnson both tallied 17 assists. Rachel Reed, a freshman middle blocker who has been dealing with injuries throughout the preseason, also earned her first career start against the Cougars. Reed chipped in four kills on a .429 hitting percentage, two aces and a team-high three blocks. Freshman outside hitter Tatum Harvey also saw action for the first time in her career, adding a service.
In what was perhaps the biggest game of the tournament, USC faced off against a familiar foe in the         No. 11-ranked BYU Cougars. The last time these two teams met, USC defeated BYU at the Galen Center in the 2013 NCAA regional semifinal.
In a very back-and-forth game with great defense played on both sides, USC was able to come up with the timely kills that allowed the Women of Troy to sweep the Cougars (25-23, 25-22, 25-22).
In this match, the offense was only coming from two of USC’s pin hitters. Bricio once again led the Women of Troy with a whopping 25 kills on a .400 hitting clip to go with her 11 digs, three blocks and a service ace. Brittany Abercrombie put up 11 kills on a .308 hitting percentage and added two blocks of her own.
Defensively, middle blocker Alicia Ogoms tallied seven blocks (one solo), libero Taylor Whittingham recorded 22 digs and the freshman Garrick added 11 digs and two aces.
Once the dust had settled, it was USC that took home the hardware at the 2015 Women of Troy Baden Invitational. Bricio was chosen as the tournament’s Most Valuable Player, and was joined on the             all-tournament team by Ogoms and Abercrombie.
USC will now gear up for their first travel trip to Cedar Falls, Iowa, to participate in the Northern Iowa Tournament held next Friday and Saturday.

In a historic anti-smoking move, the California State Senate voted last Thursday to increase the smoking age to 21 and prohibit e-cigarettes from public places that ban traditional smoking. The motion to restrict the presence of smoking echoes an institutional shift toward non-smoking, especially in higher education. Earlier this month, the University of Hawai’i at Manoa joined the more than 1,500 smoke-free campuses in the United States. The latest ban on smoking shifts the conversation closer to campus, but before administrators immediately ban smoking, they must consider the ramifications to ensure that a ban would be effective.
The University’s primary problem lies with enforcement. Just as many underage students can attest that alcohol is not difficult to find on campus, USC may not be able to fully enforce a ban on smoking. Considering that the University often fails to enforce its current smoking policy on the University Park Campus — which prohibits smoking in enclosed buildings; within 10 feet of outdoor dining areas; in facilities,  vehicles and “smoke-free” designated areas; and in locations during indoor events — it is fair to wonder whether a more comprehensive smoke-free policy will carry the weight it should.
Banning smoking on campus could also present practical issues. According to a study conducted by the Harvard School of Public Health earlier this month, one-third of college-age students have smoked a cigar or cigarette in the past four weeks.  That means that there are over 6,000 USC undergraduates who smoke. A comprehensive smoking ban could push students off-campus and if it is late at night or they are alone, students forced to leave campus could present safety issues for the University. Additionally, residence hall smokers may be forced to smoke in their dorm rooms, which could increase secondhand smoke exposure for those in the building.
As the university with the second-largest international population in the country, USC must also realize the cultural diversity of the students it houses. For many international students who smoke, the habit stems from cultural norms in a country in which smoking may carry less of a stigma. A comprehensive smoke-free policy could make it even more difficult for these students to adjust to life in Los Angeles. By imposing more of our own Western traditions and values on international students, we fail to accommodate for students for whom smoking may be a cultural habit.
Smoking is an unhealthy habit and secondhand smoke is an unfair consequence that endangers the public health of students at USC. However, before the University jumps on the bandwagon to eagerly publicize a smoke-free campus, it must invest in research that sheds light on how a smoke-free campus could affect its students. Instead of instituting an ineffective ban that fails to account for the experiences of all students, the University first needs to better comply with existing policy and ensure that smokers light up only in smoking areas. Considering the misinformation about smoking — be it the difficulty of getting addicted or the long-term effects of tobacco use — the University could also invest more in tobacco education. USC already implements sexual assault education and alcohol education for incoming freshmen and a segment on tobacco use could easily be incorporated.

There are areas on campus to smoke. They should keep those areas.
This article is right to question the implementation of a smoking ban however it is wrong in blindly stating that second hand smoke poses a health risk to others. A large number of studies show that second hand smoke is not a significant health risk to others indoors or out. 
Consider for example: James E, Kabat Geoffrey C, Smith Davey. Environmental tobacco smoke and tobacco related mortality in a prospective study of Californians, 1960-98 BMJ 2003; 326:1057. This study found “No significant associations were found for current or former exposure to environmental tobacco smoke before or after adjusting for seven confounders and before or after excluding participants with pre-existing disease. No significant associations were found during the shorter follow up periods of 1960-5, 1966-72, 1973-85, and 1973-98.” Conclusions: The results do not support a causal relation between environmental tobacco smoke and tobacco related mortality, although they do not rule out a small effect. The association between exposure to environmental tobacco smoke and coronary heart disease and lung cancer may be considerably weaker than generally believed.”

On Aug. 27, the California Senate approved a package of six bills restricting tobacco use. Most notable of the six was a motion to raise the smoking age in the state from 18 to 21, which would directly affect students on college campuses. Due to the many health hazards associated with cigarettes, universities, especially USC, should echo these anti-tobacco measures.
Since 2011, the adoption of tobacco-free campuses has rapidly increased. In October 2011, only 586 college campuses reported entirely smoke-free policies. According to the American Nonsmokers’ Rights Foundation, as of July 2015, 1,577 campuses are completely             smoke-free. A study conducted by Indiana University found that students on smoke-free campuses experienced significant changes over time to the perception of smoking, acknowledging the detrimental effects of cigarette use.
Though the ban on campus smoking restricts the personal freedoms of smokers, it protects the entire population. After all, studies show that secondhand smoke, or environmental tobacco smoke, can be as harmful as firsthand smoking. Environmental tobacco smoke has been strongly correlated with the development of lung cancer but has also been linked to leukemia, lymphoma and brain tumors, among other diseases. Moreover, some researchers maintain that thirdhand smoke, in which tobacco particles are left behind in the form of dust or stick to surfaces, can also lead to the same conditions as regular smoking. Therefore, because carcinogens from cigarettes never truly leave an environment, smoking regulation tactics such as designated smoking areas would be rendered superfluous.
The state Senate’s bill to raise the smoking age targets college-aged individuals. According to College Tobacco Prevention Resource, 40 percent of smokers start smoking in college. Nikole Cronk, a researcher studying the time when people start smoking, said, “If you ask college students, many will tell you [smoking is] something they don’t intend to do after they’re out of school, but a significant number do continue smoking. What we know is there’s no safe level of smoking and no way to know that once you start you’ll be able to easily quit.” Given that smoking bans have been proven to transform the psychology behind smoking into a more health-conscious mindset, raising the smoking age from 18 to 21 or banning smoking across college campuses reaches a very critical age gap.
The decision to start smoking stems from societal pressure, whether it be encouragement from peers or trying to fit in with social norms. Being surrounded by smoking, even just through the sight of strangers lighting up on campus, creates a mentality that the act is not just condoned, but also celebrated. If the University supports the education and awareness of cigarette use and seeks further, more decisive action, then there is potential to create meaningful progress on our campus.
If USC were to adopt a smoke-free campus persona, this would not punish smokers but rather protect the entire USC community, from students to faculty to employees. The new bill passed by the state Senate would support a healthier environment by placing an age restriction on smoking cigarettes. However, since no concrete policies have been enforced thus far, it is up to everyone to be more courteous of the pollutants put in the air. To smokers: Think before you light up.

The overwhelming majority of studies show no link between exposure to passive smoking and disease in normal exposures both indoors and outdoors. For example, Jenkins, et al, found minuscule exposure to tobacco products to bartenders and waiters in smoking establishments resulting in levels of harm characterized as ‘none’ to ‘improbable’. Jenkins, R. A., Palausky, A., Counts, R. W., Bayne, C. K., Dindal, A. B., and Guerin, M. R. Exposure to Environmental Tobacco Smoke in Sixteen Cities in the United States as Determined by Personal Breathing Zone Air Sampling. J Expo Anal Environ Epidemiol. 1996 Oct-Dec;6(4):473-502. The studies that do show an association show very weak association.
The existing smoking policy is fair and effective. Reject additional draconian smoking bans.

New kids on the block · Mad Decent Block Party is often a discovery point for electronic music enthusiasts. Here, DJs A-Trak, Cashmere Cat, Trippy Turtle and Diplo mix a set for an L.A. crowd in 2014. – Photo courtesy of Mad Decent
When I first dove into the world of electronic dance music, I wasn’t exactly sure what it entailed. In the early stages of its more mainstream development, major genres included the dubstep and techno remixes of Eurotrash songs people only associated with Dutch hostels. The more and more I explore the world of EDM and its influence in the music industry, however, the more I see how visionary the labels are — especially the ones that experiment not only with artists, but also with demographics.
One fascinating aspect of this industry and its pertinence to electronic dance music is the self-produced artists who have spearheaded most of the now-world famous labels. For example, everyone who listens to the radio has, at one point or another, heard trap star Diplo’s work. Diplo’s own success is due in part to his overall musical genius. With radio hits like “Lean On” as his Major Lazer collective and his own personal solo success as a DJ, he has gained world recognition as an innovative force in the music industry.
Besides being part of various DJ collectives such as Major Lazer and Jack Ü, Diplo also spearheaded the influential label Mad Decent. Unless you are an EDM enthusiast like myself, you probably don’t know anything about Mad Decent except for the fact that they throw huge festival-style block parties in various cities around the U.S. The label, however, has provided one of the largest and most extensive outlets for new and emerging artists in the EDM world to reach one of the most influential demographics: college students.
Started in 2005, the Philadelphia and Los Angeles-based label has a mission to promote emerging dance artists, bringing them out from the underground and onto the block. The label hit gold when dance favorite “Harlem Shake” put Mad Decent artist Baauer on the electronic music map. Not only did the video go viral, but it also launched the previously unknown artist on to the top music charts.
In 2008, Mad Decent began its Block Party tour, starting on a meager street in Philadelphia with just a few tents and stages. Now, however, this phenomenon has blown up to include cities all over the country and showcases both smaller artists and headlining radio stars.
Artists unknown to even deeply invested electronic fans have been discovered at various Block Party events. This year, Mad Decent will be welcoming some amazing artists to Los Angeles on Sept. 19 and 20 at L.A. Center Studios. Diplo himself will be performing both as his music group Major Lazer and as himself.
One of the highlights of this year’s L.A. Block Party will be Grandtheft’s DJ set. A newcomer from Canada, Grandtheft is easily one of the most diverse and interesting new artists. Not only will his performances at Mad Decent events in the coming weeks be a highlight for his personal career, but they will also serve as an example of how powerful labels can be within the music industry.
Though these Block Parties pave the way to popularity, they also represent an intimacy within the music industry between listeners and labels. Mad Decent is only one example of how self-interested artists have begun the process of removing the hierarchy of the recording industry by producing and managing themselves and representing other artists who are searching for their break into the industry.
Innovation is the key to any industry. Music, though having been around in various forms since the beginning of time, is one of the most frequently evolving industries. Its sensitivity to the social and cultural trends — especially today, in an era of technology — has given rise to electronic music, which is constantly changing due to the innovators within the industry. Mad Decent is one of those labels with major influence, challenging a familiar concept and turning it into a whole new platform for electronic artists to rise to fame.
The Mad Decent label is merely an extension of an ever-changing music frontier. Among the block parties, the rising artists and the sonic sound revolution, Mad Decent is leading the way to a bright future in the electronic dance music industry.

Band of brothers · Alternative electronic band The Drumetric Collective played a selection of songs at the annual LACMA event. In combination with the art on display and food provided, the music from the artists added to the overall experience for guests of that night. – Erika Lee | Daily Trojan
On Saturday, the Los Angeles County Museum of Art hosted its annual late-night event, “Muse ’til Midnight.” Located at the renowned and frequently Instagrammed lamp posts also known as Chris Burden’s exhibit Urban Light, the event featured a live concert that highlighted artists including Adrian Younge and his band Venice Dawn, The Drumetrics Collective and Anthony Valadez. In addition to live performances curated by ArtDontSleep, the event included never-before-seen exhibits, arts and crafts stations and a tasty variety of food and drinks. LACMA’s spectacular and eclectic event brought together hundreds of art lovers for an exciting and trendy after-hours museum experience.
This year’s event was centered around LACMA’s 50th anniversary, giving attendees an exclusive opportunity to view the “50 for 50: Gifts on the Occasion of LACMA’s Anniversary” exhibit. The exhibit includes a selection of 50 masterpieces gifted by 25 donors. These works originate from many different time periods, though most are from the 19th and 20th centuries. A standout is Claude Monet’s Two Women in a Garden, in which Monet incorporates light and color to enhance the subject of two women reading in a grass field. Another unique work is David Hockney’s The Jugglers, a single artwork comprised of 18 digital videos synchronized and presented on 18 different 55-inch screens with the song “The Stars and Stripes Forever” playing in the background. Other genres of art represented are American Pop Art, neoclassical paintings, Spanish Colonial Casta paintings and works from the 1960s, when LACMA was founded. These 50 diverse works of art represent the vast assortment of works that LACMA showcases, as well as the amount of significance the time periods had on the many art movements.
Positioned in the middle of the venue, several arts and crafts stations gave visitors the opportunity to create one-of-a-kind versions of recycled art, modeled after the Noah Purifoy’s exhibit Junk Dada. Guests used bits and pieces of lace, buttons and fabric to create their own unique masterpieces. Noah Purifoy, an artist and sculptor, contributed to the junk art movement that specializes in art with a message.
After the 1965 Watts Riots in Los Angeles, Purifoy began to create sculptures from the wreckage, inspiring artists everywhere to “make something out of nothing.” Fascinated by nature and its artistic process, Purifoy decided to move to Joshua Tree and create the first outdoor museum of environmental art. He took 10 acres of desert and created more than 120 junk sculptures. Some of his most eccentric pieces from the outdoor museum were featured in the Junk Dada exhibit, including collages and sculptures made from old cans, shoes and bicycles. Inspired by Purifoy’s art from neglected objects, DJ Mark de Clive-Lowe played music that “mashed disregarded and discarded sounds,” giving guests the full audio and visual experience.
Beyond the opening of new exhibits, “Muse ’til Midnight” offered an interesting selection of food for event-goers to try, including seafood and vegetarian gumbo, fried catfish with tartar sauce, andouille sausage, corn, old Bay Red potatoes and biscuits with gravy. Stylish guests held glasses of red wine, casually mingling and dancing to the live performances throughout the night.
The Drumetrics, a band from San Diego, opened the concert, welcoming artists and visitors with its assorted beats. The band’s songs, which rely heavily on percussion, resembled the type of music that one would hear at an electrified nightclub or as an opener at Coachella. Anthony Valadez, a turntablist from KCRW, engaged with the audience through his funky beats, jazzy vibes and smooth voice. The highlight of the main stage, though, was Adrian Younge and his band Venice Dawn, whose soulful performance grabbed the attention of everybody there. With a melodious and expressive sound, their performance was like time traveling to a concert from the 1960s. Performing their hit “Shot Me in the Heart,” the band had the whole floor swaying and cheering along to the spellbinding vocals and impressive guitar riffs.
On the third-floor gallery, DJ Rashida and J. Period performed next to Chris Burden’s Metropolis II. The sculpture, which was inspired by the hustle and bustle of a fast-paced city, is one of Burden’s most famous pieces. With the DJ’s contemporary beats that mirrored the modern art, guests were seen dancing happily to the electronic music while others admired the art of Robert Irwin’s Miracle Mile  and other works of modern artists.
An enjoyable gallery party filled with art, dancing and food, LACMA’s annual “Muse ‘til Midnight” event reflects the essence of the museum — classy and eclectic. With a little something for everybody, one does not have to be a self-proclaimed art connoisseur to enjoy this event. LACMA’s collection of diverse and intriguing art represents the equally assorted and fascinating population of Los Angeles. With exhibits rich in history, food with variety and musicians with soul, this event continually sells out and attracts art lovers from all over the city.
