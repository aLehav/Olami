It’s here.
It’s been eight months since USC last played a football game — 241 days, to be exact.
It’s actually been about 10 months since USC played a game that was enjoyable to watch, but I digress.
The wait is over. This is a team, a fan base and a program all too eager for a fresh start.
The bitter disappointment of last season can be washed out. We can stop, at least for a few hours, with the incessant speculation about quarterbacks. Tonight at 8 p.m., we can watch football. And man, that’s a beautiful thing.
Over the week of practice leading up to tonight’s game, I asked several players what, if anything, sets the first game apart from all the others. Their answer, almost collectively, was as simple as it is obvious. But it is also undeniably true.
What makes the first game so special? “Because it’s the first game.”
There really isn’t any better way to say it. Junior wide receiver Marqise Lee said it four times in his answer, like Allen Iverson talking about practice.
“I mean, it’s the first game,” Lee said emphatically. “That’s it. It’s the first game. It’s the first chance to go out there and do what you’re supposed to do. It’s the first game. I mean, it’s the first game!”
Well said, Marqise, well said. After the utter collapse of last season — you know, the 1-5 record in the last six games, the rampant rumors of team dissent, the seemingly total lack of leadership, the very thought of the Sun Bowl — it’s about time for something new.
“Man, it’s been a long time,” Lee said on Saturday. “I’ve been ready since the end of the bowl game. I’m ready just like everyone else. We’ve been ready. First game on Thursday. It’s on.”
For seniors, such as defensive lineman Devon Kennard, it’s the last first game they will ever play. Kennard missed all of 2012 with a torn pectoral muscle, so one can only imagine how ready he is to take the field tonight.
“I’ve been through a lot,” said Kennard, who also tore his ACL as a senior in high school. “I don’t take it for granted now, being able to be out here and being able to play with my teammates.”
And what did Kennard say about the distinctiveness of the opener? You guessed it.
“It’s the first game,” said the newly-named team captain. “You can’t duplicate that. It’s the first game of the season. And it’s my senior season, so this is gonna be a special game for me because it’s the first of the last. So I’m looking forward to that.”
We all are: coaches, players, fans, students, media. Football is ingrained in the fabric of this school in a way that isn’t really seen outside of the South.
Entire social calendars revolve around the football schedule. Going to Stanford or Cal for the Weekender up north is seemingly as commonplace as going to class — which is to say that plenty of people don’t go, but plenty others do. The thought of students actually going to any afternoon class on Thursday, October 10, when USC hosts Arizona that night, is completely laughable.
There is something magical about fall Saturdays (or Thursdays, I guess) here. Many students and alumni distinctly remember the first time they woke up on game day as a freshman, looked out their dorm room window and saw McCarthy Quad as they never had before.
Common coach-speak would dictate that every game is the same, and the first game is just as exciting as all the others. But even Lane Kiffin admits that’s not true.
“No matter what you say about trying to treat everything the same, it’s natural that when the game gets closer, and the guys know there’s an opponent coming, they pick it up a little bit,” Kiffin said.
Defensive line coach Ed Orgeron, one coach never afraid to speak his mind, elaborated a little further.
“It’s the anticipation [that sets the first game apart], for me,” Orgeron said. “You’ve been working all camp. You’ve been in spring ball, you’ve been in the weight room and now you finally get to play somebody else. I mean, it’s why you play the game.”
You would be hard-pressed to find a member of the football program, athletic department or even the Trojan Family with more “Trojan Spirit” than the man they call Coach O. And perhaps he put it best.
“I love representing the Trojans,” Orgeron said. “Every time we put on the Cardinal and Gold and watch these guys play, it’s special for me.”
I think it’s fair to say that Coach O was speaking for everyone.

Amid a preseason full of widespread uncertainty involving crippling injuries, still-undecided position battles and a new defensive scheme, USC’s football team will look to begin its 2013 campaign with one familiar constant — a victorious season opener against Hawai’i.
Center of attention · The Trojans will rely on redshirt junior linebacker Hayes Pullard as a fulcrum in defensive coordinator Clancy Pendergast’s 5-2 scheme as the leading returner on defense with 108 tackles. – Daily Trojan file photo
 
Thursday’s game in Aloha Stadium marks the third time in the past four seasons that USC has started its season against the Warriors, and the Trojans put up 49 points in both the 2010 and 2012 contests to put the games out of the Warriors’reach.
On the first play of scrimmage in last year’s matchup, a simple 5-yard out route by then-sophomore wide receiver Marqise Lee turned into a 75-yard touchdown after Lee juked out a helpless Hawai’i defender on his way to scampering down the sideline for a score and figuratively announcing himself as a Heisman frontrunner.
One year later, Lee is generally considered the top wideout in the nation, and sophomore Nelson Agholor and freshman Darreus Rogers both appear to have the talent to pull off a similar game-breaking play against the Warriors’ porous pass defense.
It’s still unclear, however, which of the redshirt sophomore quarterbacks Cody Kessler and Max Wittek will be delivering the ball to Lee and the rest of the receiving corps.
“We’re excited to see both of them play,” USC head coach Lane Kiffin said. “We look at it as an opportunity for two guys to play great, just like when you’re excited for two guys to play tailback.”
Fittingly, the Trojans are also expected to split touches in the backfield between freshman Justin Davis and redshirt sophomore Tre Madden to compensate for the absence of senior Silas Redd, who will not travel to Hawai’i. Redd has been nursing a knee injury throughout fall camp after undergoing surgery on his meniscus in the spring.
“I had the worst possible meniscus tear you could have,” Redd told Scott Wolf of the Los Angeles Daily News earlier this week. “It’s extremely frustrating. I want to play extremely bad.”
If Kessler ends up starting against Hawai’i, USC’s first-string backfield will have virtually no game experience on offense; Kessler has only attempted and completed two passes for the Trojans — in mop-up duty last year versus Colorado — and neither Davis nor Madden have recorded a carry.
But compared to the Warriors’ current situation on offense, USC’s attack looks like a sure thing.
Hawai’i fired offensive coordinator Aaron Price at the beginning of fall camp after the Warriors finished last season ranked 101st in passing yards per game (189.8) and 114th in rushing yards per game (108.6). Hawai’i coach Norm Chow will assume playcalling duties, setting up a rare matchup between head coaches doubling as offensive playcallers.
Last year’s starting quarterback, senior Sean Schroeder, has been passed over in favor of junior Taylor Graham, a transfer from Ohio State.
Graham was ranked as the No. 14 quarterback in his class out of high school by Rivals.com and should be a better fit in coach Norm Chow’s pro-style system than his predecessor. But he hasn’t started a game since 2009, when he was in high school, and the firing of the team’s offensive coordinator just weeks before the start of the season appears to signal a lack of confidence from Chow in how his unit was performing leading up to the season.
And even though the Warriors return eight starters on defense, none of them showed the ability to contain the Trojans’ passing game last year.
USC torched the Warriors for 372 yards through the air, with Lee accounting for 197 of those in addition to a 100-yard kick return for a touchdown.
This year the Trojans’ aerial attack could thrive again, even with two inexperienced quarterbacks.
The main knock on Kessler and Wittek throughout the preseason has been their inability to perform when under pressure from USC’s formidable defensive line. But USC’s offensive line should hold up better against Hawai’i’s defensive front, which only forced nine interceptions and 22 sacks while facing relatively soft competition in the Mountain West conference.
Chow would certainly love to hand Kiffin and the Trojans an enormous upset loss in the pair’s third meeting, especially considering the friendly rivalry the two hold after working together at USC under former coach Pete Carroll.
But history isn’t on Hawai’i’s side.
USC hasn’t suffered a loss in its first game since 1997, hasn’t dropped a non-conference road game since 2006 and is 8-0 all-time against the Warriors. The Trojans have never beaten Hawai’i by less than 13 points.
And if Kiffin wants to silence the USC fans who are calling for his dismissal, he’d be advised not to be involved in the conclusion of any of those streaks.
The Trojans and Warriors kick off at 8 p.m. on CBS Sports Network.

Every generation, it seems, bears with it a unique set of fears. I take comfort imagining that even in biblical times, people — after years of parental warning — would scan the room at the slightest fear that unwanted ears were listening in.
But the 21st century seems to have ushered in a new set of fears that even the most careful mother could not possibly prepare her children for. And it’s not for lack of trying. Believe me when I say that my mom was one of the first to preach the dangers of the Internet.
“I heard a great piece on the radio that said to never write anything you wouldn’t want to be read in front of a jury or your grandmother,” she’d warn every other day.
Though I understood the sentiment, I can’t say the concern entirely captured the so-called “dangers of the web.”
The issue was she was applying 20th century logic to a 21st-century problem. We don’t get to control 21st-century fears. They just happen.
Here’s one fear in three words: The meme generator. Long gone are the days when you know when someone is taking a picture of you. Today, anyone can take a picture of you as you unknowingly go about your daily activities — walking to class, spilling your coffee, running on the treadmill.
Next thing you know, a frenemy has sent you a Facebook message that says, “Look, it’s YOU!” Underneath is a link. You click and see that your valiant effort to work out at the gym has quickly become a meme on a list of the “10 Most Average Ways to Look Embarrassing.” You check Twitter, but it’s too late. The list has already been retweeted 652 times.
But wait, there’s more. Now thanks to GIFs, you can go viral live action and on loop.
Similar is my fear of photobombing a viral video. It goes like this. One day, you’ll be out in public, say, at the mall. You’ll be having a heated argument and gesticulating wildly (as I have a bad habit of doing when truly invested in a conversation).
Little do you know, a news crew has been filming a segment for the 6 o’clock news and decided to use the skirmish in a cutaway. The next morning, you awake to find your fight has been broadcast via a Gawker post the next morning: “Local TV Crew Catches Cosmo Kramer Impersonator Fighting at Mall.” You can see it on The Daily Show’s “Moment of Zen” already. This will absolutely happen to me; it’s just a matter of time.
Recently, one of my 21st-century fears did, in fact, come true. And I learned quite a lot about myself in the process.
Apparently, I purchased tickets to sit in the front row of a Jesse McCartney and Backstreet Boys concert. I also occasionally “look at myself in the mirror and randomly start twerking #isthatweird.” And, on June 12, I apparently wanted to “sneak into the church nursery and eat all the cookies #PastoralConfessions.”
Or so said a fake Twitter account.
Over the summer, I discovered that someone had created an imposter account in my name with the exact profile settings I use on my actual Twitter. More on this in a future column, though.
Now that you probably think I’m certifiably paranoid, I’m here to say I’m not. I also don’t hate technology. In fact, I’m told it has eliminated many fears that used to plague past generations. Long gone are the fears of hopelessly yearning for a soul mate, at least according to the ads. Now, they say your worries can vanish with the click of a button. Simply create a profile on Match.com (though I’m guessing my mom would rather I use JDate).
In short, my discomfort with 21st-century fears stems from an overall lack of control over my technological fate. It’s true that, in the past, one was never fully able to control their identity. Yet we seem to have shed a greater degree of control with new ways of communicating through certain technologies.
Unlike sending a letter or its evolved form, a text, one is no longer always able to make a choice about how he or she is portrayed. More often than not, it seems the choice is left at the mercy of other people.
At one moment, you might seem to be the regulator of your own reputation. Then the next night, you’re a national dinner table conversation because some eager blogger has stuck your terribly photoshopped head in front of an ugly gradient and called it a meme.
So this is life, I guess. Things are not changing anytime soon. And that’s my issue to deal with. But let’s just say I’d sleep a lot better if the Internet would stick to cats.

College football season has finally arrived and that means tons of great tailgates and couch-sitting with the gang. Yet it’s easy to get sick of the old game-day grub. Here are some easy-to-prepare and delicious recipes inspired by the web to cover all of your game day needs. This week, the Trojans have an away game at Hawai’i, so unless you’re reading this from the Aloha State, chances are you’ll be watching this game from the comfort of your couch. Here are some recipes to get you game-day ready for a home viewing party:
Cherry Limeade
An ice cold glass of tart cherry limeade is a perfect cold drink to help cut through even the heaviest of game day foods, especially considering the hot weather that lingers through September in L.A. “Bakingdom” has a great cherry limeade recipe that uses enough sweet maraschino cherries to help balance the acidity of limes.
Ingredients:
1 cup lime juice
3/4 cup sugar
1 16-ounce jar maraschino cherries and juice
1 2-liter lemon lime soda (I prefer Sierra Mist)
To make a full batch: Chill all of the ingredients thoroughly. In a large pitcher or jar, combine sugar, lime juice and maraschino cherry juice. Swirl or stir until the sugar has dissolved. Add the soda. Garnish with the cherries and several thinly-cut lime slices.
To make a single serving: Chill all of the ingredients thoroughly. In a 12-ounce or larger glass, combine sugar, lime juice and maraschino cherry juice. Swirl or stir until the sugar has dissolved. Add the soda. Garnish with cherries and lime slices.
Bacon-Wrapped Blue Cheese Stuffed BBQ Chicken Bites
The following recipe by “Lauren’s Latest” is a guilty pleasure and an excellent midnight snack. The bacon-wrapped, blue cheese-stuffed pieces of BBQ chicken are a hit at any party. It’s a pub-food twist on the usual bacon-wrapped “victory dogs” you smell from the cart vendors on the way to the Coliseum.
Ingredients:
2 large chicken breasts (boneless, skinless)
5 slices hickory smoked bacon
1/3 cup blue cheese crumbles
3 tablespoons BBQ sauce and a splash of water to thin it out
Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Slice bacon strips into four sections and then cut the chicken into 20 small slices. Scatter the blue cheese on top of the chicken. Place a strip of bacon on top of the blue cheese and stretch it around each piece of chicken. Use a toothpick to secure it. Don’t worry if the bacon doesn’t stretch all the way around.
Mix the BBQ sauce with a little water to thin it out before basting the chicken pieces. Place into preheated oven and bake them for 15 minutes.
Ancho Lentil Tacos
Though these tacos don’t contain any meat or gluten, the “Post Punk Kitchen” tacos taste just like the real deal, and have a kick in every bite. The savory ancho chiles are a great addition to this would-be “normal lentil tacos” recipe, and make it easy for someone who’s not gluten-free to think twice about their usual eating habits. These tacos are a healthier alternative to the usual beef or pork tacos, and are a memorable dish to enjoy.
Ingredients:
2 teaspoons olive oil
1 small onion, minced
2 cloves garlic, minced
2 1/2 cups cooked lentils (from about 1 cup dried)
3 tablespoons tomato paste
2 tablespoons hot sauce (preferably Cholula)
 
Spice mix:
1/2 teaspoon dried oregano
2 teaspoons ground ancho chile
1 teaspoon ground cumin
1/2 teaspoon ground coriander
1/2 teaspoon salt
First, combine all of the ingredients for the spice mix and set aside.
Preheat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Saute the onion, garlic and a pinch of salt in oil for about three minutes, until lightly browned. Add spices and let them cook for approximately 30 seconds. Lower the heat to simmer and add lentils, a few teaspoons of water, tomato paste and hot sauce. You can use a fork to mash them a bit until they hold together. Add splashes of water as necessary if the mixture gets dry.
Potato Chip Brownies
This sweet and salty treat inspired by “A Beautiful Mess” is great for those who quite literally fall into the category of football “couch potatoes.” Though at first glance one might think combining potato chips with chocolate brownies seems strange, the texture and flavor of this dessert might just score that elusive touchdown among your friends.
Ingredients:
1 1/2 cup all-purpose flour
2 teaspoons baking powder
1 teaspoon sea salt
1 cup butter
10 ounces dark chocolate chips
1 tablespoon cocoa
2 1/4 cup sugar
1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract
5 eggs
3 cups crushed potato chips
Mix together flour, baking powder, salt and cocoa. In a different pot, melt together the butter with eight ounces of chocolate and sugar. Once melted together, remove from heat and set aside. Add eggs and extract to the flour mixture and stir.
Pour in the chocolate butter mixture and stir. Pour into a baking pan. Top with potato chips. Bake at 350 degrees for 28-32 minutes. When you remove the potato chip brownies from the oven, drizzle approximately two ounces of melted chocolate on top. Let cool and serve.

For a film built around political outrage, Closed Circuit is a curiously subdued affair, an indictment of the British intelligence community that never raises its voice above a low, urgent whisper.

Despite its timely subject matter and the best efforts of a reliable cast, director John Crowley’s middlebrow courtroom drama, released in the wake of the Bradley Manning verdict and the ongoing saga of Edward Snowden, deals with everything from intelligence leaks to overreaching government agencies in a manner so topically tranquilized it could pass for cinematic anesthesia.
Without revealing too much, the basic setup plays like a latter-day Adam’s Rib crossbred with a dour, derivative version of A Few Good Men. In the aftermath of a devastating suicide bombing in a busy London marketplace, MI6 arrests Turkish immigrant and heroin addict Farroukh Erdogan (Denis Moschitto), painting him as the mastermind behind the attack. The young man’s trial is closed to the public, a measure meant to prevent the dissemination of classified evidence that will supposedly ensure his conviction — evidence that will likely never see the light of day.
When Erdogan’s defense counsel mysteriously commits suicide, the attorney general (Jim Broadbent) replaces the dead man with rival barristers/ex-lovers Martin Rose (Eric Bana) and Claudia Simmons-Howe (Rebecca Hall). As the case’s special advocate, Claudia is given exclusive access to the aforementioned files, delivered to her by a flirtatious, vaguely creepy government handler (Riz Ahmed). From there the genre tropes fly thick and fast: Discrepancies are discovered, lives are threatened, Old Bailey wigs are ruffled, romance is rekindled and cars are rudely T-boned in the middle of important conversations.
Closed Circuit bears a surface-level resemblance to the great conspiracy thrillers of the 1970s, an auteur-driven sub-genre typified by classics such as Francis Coppola’s The Conversation and Sydney Pollack’s Three Days of the Condor. Unlike those earlier films, however, Crowley and screenwriter Steven Knight rely on plot-driven characters as opposed to character-driven plots, meaning that Bana and Hall are reduced to playing archetypal placeholders for the majority of the movie.
Even their sexual tension feels calculated and perfunctory; a distraction from the thornier political issues (terrorism, surveillance abuses, the illusion of control), Knight’s screenplay seems all too willing to quietly gloss over hot-button topics. This is especially surprising given his previous work, which has never shied away from hot-button issues, tackling everything from prostitution rings to black market organ trafficking. Dirty Pretty Things, David Cronenberg’s Eastern Promises and this summer’s Jason Statham vehicle, Redemption (released internationally as Hummingbird), are all vivid, harrowing portraits of London’s nightmare fringes, stories that embrace their subjects with harsh, unblinking devotion. Closed Circuit, by contrast, treats its touchiest elements with thematic kid gloves.
Hall, who stole the show in Nicole Holofcener’s Please Give and Ben Affleck’s The Town, specializes in playing tightly-wound professional types who undergo some kind of spiritual crisis or reawakening. Her struggle to find depth and nuance in Claudia is undermined at every turn by the movie’s oddly brief 96-minute runtime. Bana, who held his own opposite Cate Blanchett and Saoirse Ronan in 2011’s Grimm Euro-thriller Hanna, fares a bit better, especially during his scenes with Broadbent’s faux-jolly attorney general, which crackle with a cynical, hard-bitten exuberance largely missing from the rest of the film.
The supporting cast of Closed Circuit is arguably its saving grace. Ciarán Hinds, the craggy Irish character actor best known for supporting turns in There Will Be Blood and Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy, radiates noble exhaustion as Martin’s fellow barrister and law school mentor Devlin, who might know more about the Erdogan case than he’s letting on. Ahmed, the lone highlight of last spring’s otherwise forgettable The Reluctant Fundamentalist, brings a sense of ambiguous menace to an underwritten role as a self-loathing Muslim MI5 agent, while Julia Stiles (The Bourne trilogy) makes the most of her limited screentime as Joanna, a meddlesome New York Times reporter who goes to extreme lengths to contact Martin.
As far as late August releases go, Closed Circuit is a cut above juvenile claptrap such as Kick Ass 2 and We’re the Millers, but it’s difficult to imagine this classy but dramatically sluggish thriller lingering too long in anyone’s memory. Though the supporting performances and mildly diverting third act keep its heart beating, it’s still difficult to summon even faint praise for a movie that manages to do so little with so much potential.

Brooklyn-based composers Andrew Norman and Ted Hearne are joining the faculty of USC Thornton School of Music. Both will become full-time professors, with Norman starting this semester and Hearne in the fall semester of 2014.

Norman, a Thornton alumnus, was nominated for a Pulitzer Prize in music for “The Companion Guide to Rome,” a piece inspired by the year he spent living in the Italian city. Currently, Norman is composing a piano concerto for the Los Angeles Philharmonic.
The 30-year-old has also worked as the Los Angeles Chamber Orchestra’s composer-in-residence.  Norman will teach a part-time course load this fall due to prior commitments, including Composition I. Students from Thornton said they  already look forward to taking Norman’s classes.
“I will actually be studying composition with Norman this year — a successful, contemporary composer who has been commissioned to write works for a gamut of well-known music ensembles,” said Drew Mikuska, a sophomore majoring in music composition. “I greatly look forward to musical adventures on which Norman might take me and my fellow peers on this year — a breath of fresh air in a department already brimming with compositional geniuses.”
Norman himself is looking forward to beginning his new position at USC.
“I went to the Thornton school so this place means a lot to me,” Norman said.  “I had great mentors there, and I’m looking forward to helping fellow young Trojans,” Norman said. “The school has a rich tradition of great performing teachers and great composing teachers. It’s a great honor to be a part of that.”
Norman believes his musical background will be a great addition to Thornton.
“I try to bring all my musical experience— being a pianist and composer— to my students,” Norman said. “[Having] been a freelance composer for about 10 years now, that’s the most valuable thing to bring to a student: the experience of being a composer in real life.”
Though not joining USC this year, Chicago native Ted Hearne will soon join Norman as a professor in Thornton. Hearne is most well-known for combining classic music with operatic and orchestral sounds into contemporary genres such as rock.
“I’m really into music that successfully combines different musical traditions into something original and confounding,” Hearne wrote in his bio for the Los Angeles philharmonic.
Professor of Composition Frank Ticheli offered some insight into the hiring of both Norman and Hearne.
“[Norman and Hearne] were chosen out of more than 100 applicants,” Ticheli said. “What drew us to them was the fact that they’re part of the hot Brooklyn [music] scene.”
Students also seem to be excited that Norman and Hearne both come from diverse and extensive musical backgrounds.
“It’s wonderful to see the music program expanding and welcoming more inspirational instructors to the Thornton family,” said Natasha Todd, a sophomore majoring in music industry.
“I hope to get the opportunity to learn from our newest faculty members and gain all the experience they have to offer.”
Hello, Selena–
Although I’m not really sure what you mean by “Broadway alumni,” I will say that neither Andrew Norman nor Ted Hearne have performed on Broadway. Why did you title it as such?
Best regards,
Christopher P.

The National Inventors Hall of Fame and the History Channel’s Modern Marvels program has named Professor Behrokh Khoshnevis research as one of the top 25 best inventions of 2006. Khoshnevis, a professor in USC’s Viterbi School of Engineering presented his work in Washington D.C. on July 23, NASA’s annual Technology Day.

Khoshnevis’ research is based on his invention of the groundbreaking automated construction method called “Contour Crafting,” which creates large scale structures layer by layer, similar to that of the process of 3-D Printing.
For his work with NASA, Khoshnevis tailored the process of “Contour Crafting” for extraterrestrial applications.
“I was looking at areas where my technology could be used besides the applications in building construction,” Khoshnevis said. “I thought about construction on the moon or on Mars, and I noticed that primarily, everything is based on taking stuff from Earth.”
Khoshnevis, in collaboration with NASA, is developing landing pads for the moon and Mars.
“So far, everything that has landed on the moon and Mars has landed on soft soil, and that is pretty dangerous… You need a flat surface which is also strong, which is also capable of handling high temperature of the exhaust fumes.”
If successful, Professor Khoshnevis’ endeavors could vault USC onto the global stage.
“Professor Khoshnevis’ research really establishes USC as a global community, and I think many students will be inspired by his passion to further pursue their own goals,” said Ying Ying Lei, a sophomore majoring in electrical engineering.
Brian Weiniger, a junior majoring in astronautical engineering, also praised Khoshnevis’ research.
“Colonizing the moon can be done in many ways. Rather than sending rockets to build lunar outposts piece by piece, this new technology holds the capability to build everything on the moon while using materials that are already there,” Weiniger said. “It goes to show how brilliant the professors are at USC. Having role models like Khoshnevis teach at our school is inspiring for students to push the envelope and create the ideas that will mold our future.”
Khoshnevis teaches both industrial and systems engineering, and civil and environmental engineering classes, and is the director of the Center for Rapid Automated Fabrication Technologies, as well as the Manufacturing Engineering Graduate Program at USC. His work, however, is not limited to the field of engineering.
“There are a lot of students sending me emails who want to be a part of the technology development,” Khoshnevis said. “There are students from architecture, engineering, business school, even social sciences and the arts. There is a sense that we are on the edge of something that could change the face of civilization.”
While his research has already achieved significant results, Khoshnevis has even loftier expectations for it.
“What I basically envision and hope is that one [of] the most major technologies that will have a very significant impact on the well-being of the whole population is about to emerge out of this activity,” he said.

The Trojan Farmers’ Market, a weekly event beginning this year, debuted on McCarthy Quad Wednesday.
The farmers’ market, which took place from 11 a.m. to 3 p.m., welcomed vendors from produce to artisan soaps.

The market is a joint undertaking by USC Hospitality and Undergraduate Student Government. They hope that it will become a convenient place for Trojans to shop for groceries.
“The intention of the Trojan Farmers’ Market at USC is to make a unique meeting place for students and faculty around a healthy lifestyle that everyone can enjoy,” the Facebook event page reads.
Much of the produce at the farmers’ market was local and organic. According to Damien Joyner, a vendor for Smit Orchards, all of the company’s fruits, nuts and oils are certified organic and grown in San Diego. Smit does not ship its products farther than two hours away to guarantee freshness.
Though health might have been a main motivation for USC Hospitality to start the farmers’ market, students have noticed other benefits.
“They gave us a lot of samples, and the price was pretty good,” Emily Jiang, a freshman majoring in accounting, said.
Students also seemed impressed by the amount of options offered.
“[The farmers’ market] had an amazing selection of fruits and vegetables. All of my friends and I bought strawberries and blueberries,” Aaron Rifkind, a sophomore majoring in international relations, said. “There was tons of ethnic cuisine, too, which I really enjoyed.”
The Trojan Farmers’ Market is not limited to fruits and vegetables. Stands sold hummus, kettle corn and boba tea. Kettle corn appeared to be an especially popular item for sale.
“It’s so good that I could probably bathe in this all day, but I’d be super sticky afterwards,” Brian Ramirez, a fifth-year architecture student, said of the treat.
USG is looking to cater the market to students’ interests. They even asked students what kinds of vendors they would like to see at the market using Twitter.
Creating a farmers’ market on Trousdale Parkway was one of the campaign platforms of USG President Christian Kurth and Vice President Ryan Park.
“In my USG experience before, I had always worked really closely with [USC] Hospitality,” said Kurth. “We wanted to get started on this right away so we approached them last year and worked on it over the summer.”
According to Kurth, USC Hospitality is responsible for the business side of the farmers’ market, while USG is in charge of the student aspect, including selecting a club to join the vendors on the quad each week.
“We wanted to make sure students were given the opportunity and would have the chance to get some face time,” Kurth said.
Interested clubs can apply online to be part of the farmers’ market and will mainly be selected on a first-come, first-served basis.
Though Kurth said he was happy with the turnout for the market today, he expects more traffic in the future.
“Obviously today was the involvement fair, which was huge. We kind of expected less traffic today, in addition, because the sorority girls are not allowed to go to McCarthy Quad,” said Kurth. “However, everyone I talked to had really great feedback.”

This fall marks the first semester of the World Bachelor’s in Business (WBB) program, a new major in the Marshall School of Business that allows freshmen to travel to three continents over a period of four years, and earn degrees from universities in Milan and Hong Kong as well as USC.
The program is a partnership between USC, Bocconi University in Milan and the Hong Kong School of Science and Technology.
“WBB represents a unique approach to undergraduate education that global executives have been demanding for years, an approach that will prepare a new generation of leaders for the opportunities of an increasingly interconnected world,” Provost and Senior Vice President for Academic Affairs Elizabeth Garrett, said in a USC Marshall press release.
Forty-five students were admitted to the program for the fall 2013 semester. The students will spend one year at each university and choose which of the three universities they want to spend their final year at. They will earn business degrees from all three institutions.
“It’s definitely a little nerve-wracking to be one of the ‘guinea pigs’ for this program,” Sophia Lim, a freshman World Bachelor’s in Business member from Hong Kong, said. “I’m comforted by the fact that the pros and the expected outcome of WBB outweigh the cons.”
The WBB students have intenational backgrounds as  diverse as the program itself. They are united, however, by their interest in global business at Marshall.
“I was planning on applying to USC, and I saw an advertisement for WBB on Marshall’s website,” said Austin, Texas native Aseem Afsah. “For me it was about the language and culture. I’m passionate to learn as much as I can. It opens doors to learning about whole new sets of people.”
WBB participants take a mandatory course on Mondays and Wednesdays in addition to the standard USC Marshall curriculum. Fellow Marshall students and faculty view the program as a way for the school to further establish itself as a leader in global business.
“From a [global] business standpoint, the best benefit is getting immersed in culture,” Brian Bourn, a senior majoring in business administration, said. “Seeing what business is like firsthand in Hong Kong is better than learning about it through a class in Los Angeles.”
The WBB students participated in Welcome Week events along with other freshmen. Though they are part of an exclusive set of accepted applicants, the WBB students feel a connection to the Trojan Family as a whole.
“I really liked the speeches by the president and the dean,” Anna Pollastri, a WBB student from Italy, said of the convocation ceremony. “They talked about the Trojan Family… I really like the word ‘family.’ We’re not just classmates. We’re a small group of WBB students, but we’re a part of something bigger.”
WBB participants plan on taking advantage of USC’s unique scholastic and extracurricular opportunities during their year in Los Angeles.
“I’m interested in business, but I have a deep passion for cinema,”  Augusto Vighy, a freshman from Vicenza, Italy, said.
Vighy hopes to attend the School of Cinematic Arts’ symposiums and lectures this fall.
Though students are excited about the variety of cultures they will experience at three universities, some regret missing out on the typical four-year college experience.
“The biggest negative is that you only stay for one year,” Vighy said. “That’s tough. I’ve already met some cool guys, and they’re going here for all four years, and I’ll only be here for one.”
Others view the rapid change in a positive light.
“I love USC so far,” said Douglas Rose, a London native in the WBB program. “It’s going to be hard to say goodbye once this year is over. But I also think I’ll love Milan. I’ll love Hong Kong. I think by the end, we [WBB] students will have had a great experience.”

Recently declassified documents about the National Security Agency’s massive data collection program revealed that the NSA has been annually collecting as many as 56,000 “wholly domestic” communications. This revelation comes as part of a now-declassified secret Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act court opinion from 2011 on the matter. The opinion further states that the program, as originally planned, was unconstitutional.
Wendy Fu | Daily Trojan
These revelations strike at the core problem of the NSA spying program, which is a lack of oversight and accountability predicated by transparency. The American people, because of leaks by people such as Edward Snowden, are only now learning about the spying programs that have been violating our constitutional rights for years.
The fundamental lack of transparency in the program means that the American people can have no meaningful say in the program and cannot have informed opinions about the matter. In a democracy, the people need to make informed decisions about the methods and practices of their government. The United States federal government has not been honest with the American people about the extent to which the NSA is spying on Americans. Americans deserve the right to know what communications the NSA is tracking with or without warrants before deciding whether to vote for candidates that would allow these types of programs to continue.
Unfortunately, the federal government has made it impossible to fully determine the extent of NSA spying. When the Snowden leaks originally emerged, the U.S. federal government was quick to assure the American people that the NSA program was only being used to spy on international threats and not to violate the rights of American citizens. The most recently released documents state that domestic communications have been saved, however, and show that the government has not been entirely truthful about the NSA.
The press cannot independently determine the extent of the NSA spying because the Obama administration has become the most aggressive administration to punish leaks, according to ProPublica and The New York Times. The Obama administration has gone so far as to investigate a Fox News reporter in pursuit of a leak, violating First Amendment and Press Shield laws. This aggressive stance is the reason that Snowden had to flee to Russia and Attorney General Eric Holder had to assure the world that his government would not torture or execute Snowden if he was extradited back to the U.S. The independent press cannot act effectively if they cannot investigate or if confidential sources are too afraid to come forward.
Of course, government secrecy does serve legitimate purpose. Calls for transparency in the NSA affair should not be confused with demands for complete and total government transparency in all areas. The Atlantic’s Mark Bowden published an article accusing Snowden and recently convicted hacker Bradley Manning of leaking too much about the inner workings of the U.S. government. Unlike the Watergate and Pentagon Papers leaks, when whistleblowers Mark Felt and Daniel Ellsberg took specific documents and limited the scope of their leaks to specific and identifiable abuses of government power, Snowden and Manning released oceans of classified documents without specific concerns other than the general and necessary secrecy of certain functions within the U.S. government. But the NSA spying, for what is seems to be right now, needs to be understood and approved by voters before it can be allowed to continue.
The American people could approve of the way the NSA is spying on them and people around the world. The Foreign Affairs Journal recently reported that Americans are now as afraid of an imminent terrorist attack as we were after 9/11. American concern for security could trump the desire for privacy and constitutional rights, as it did during the WWII internment of Japanese-Americans or investigations by Senator Joseph McCarthy in pursuing “communists.” If that is the case, then the American people need to be given the opportunity to vote to enact changes to allow the NSA program to continue. Until the federal government is open and honest about the method of surveillance, the amount of domestic surveillance and the effectiveness of the spying, however, America cannot approve of continued 1984-esque programs.

This is suspiciously posted and seems like a post that is a re-hash of existing material with nothing new or novel. 
Unfortunately the article falls apart in the end, the 61% number includes those that believe government itself is provoking or sponsoring said terrorism.
Be very careful when trying to be balanced in reporting, balance means reporting in a way that is an accurate representation of the reality of the situation, not equalizing opposite forces in reality.
The truth is, that there are not equal views or feelings on the NSA revelations — there are a hit more people against it, than for it. A FISA court judge even spoke out against the NSA.
This almost appears to be propaganda.
Are we supposed to think that the NSA hi-jinks are limited because of, “Recently declassified documents”? If the USA public and the world had the full picture, it would probably reveal that the NSA is a supreme waste of tax payer funds. As long as they are allowed to keep us in the dark, they can say over and over how “critical” their mission is. 
Well Congress, it is high time to perform a cost benefit analysis! 
How many dollars and privacy violations per conviction?

I am not an Independent. On the vast majority of issues, I find myself squarely to the left of center on the political spectrum. I registered to vote as a nonpartisan. I did this because being nonpartisan does not make one independent on issues of policy — it makes one independent on issues of politics.

There is a difference. Such a distinction might seem small. But it makes us a house divided. And as President Lincoln warned, a house divided cannot stand.
A partisan is a staunch supporter and defender of a political party. In most other countries that have smartly strayed away from the two-party system of the United States, the term carries a horrendously negative connotation. To be partisan in the United Kingdom, for example, is to defend the party at all costs. It is to deny the ability of the opposition to enact change or offer different solutions to the challenges before the government. Partisans refuse to admit that their compatriots on the other side of the aisle might be right in some instances. Sound familiar?
The United States Congress is a house divided because we deal with issues of policy with the tools of politics. The 112th Congress had the fifth-highest number of vote counts since 1947, but passed fewer bills since any Congress since then, according to the Huffington Post. What does this tell us?
Often, debates on the Hill and State capitols are rife with extra-legislative motivations and are counterproductive to the duty of our government, which is to represent the interests of the majority. Not the rich. Not the powerful. Not the well connected. The majority.
How do we go about putting policy on a higher pedestal than politics? It begins by recognizing that the answer is not to be bipartisan. To strive for bipartisanship as the epitome of political engagement is to foolishly believe that it is possible for a group of very different people with very different ideals to somehow not choose differently on most issues. The ideal outcome is not to increase the times we agree, but rather to make the times that we disagree more productive.
The philosopher Hagel posited that intellectual advancement is facilitated through the dialectic: That is, the combination of the thesis and the antithesis. In other words, Hagel believed that taking two ideas that were in opposition to each other and reconciling them to form a solution created a synthesis better than either of them alone.
Thus, an essential starting point for bettering our politics is to understand that disagreement should be productive. The status quo of legislating is that our representatives are unwilling to reconcile disagreements in the productive fashion that Hagel envisioned. Instead, our disagreements become what Winston Churchill affectionately referred to as a “sausage factory,” where one sees and smells a lot of nasty things that induce wincing.
The next step in the process is to understand that to be non-partisan is not to be bipartisan. Bipartisanship is the rosy euphemism bestowed upon miraculous agreements between the Republicans and the Democrats. To be nonpartisan means that one refuses to engage in struggles motivated by party allegiance, special interests and personal gain, and instead utilizes disagreements to incorporate the needs of the opposition while still preserving one’s initial intent.
The problem with bipartisanship is that it mistakenly believes agreement to be a better form of politics than productive disagreement. This is wrong. Where bipartisanship would happily make purple out of red and blue, nonpartisanship would produce a marble cake that preserves the best aspects of both colors.
It is appropriate to question the above logic in instances where a clear majority is present. Why care about the opposition when their support is not needed? Several reasons. First, in most systems with more than two parties, a coalition is needed to achieve a majority with voting power. Second, in the two party system, a victory along party lines sows the seeds of discontent for political struggles later on. Furthermore, the Senate rule requiring 60 votes to end a debate means that no party can have an unbreakable majority (it has happened twice in 30 years).
By focusing on domestic political disputes through the lens of nonpartisanship, progress can be made. It is a rare day when both parties can initially come together in support of a policy, but it is an even rarer day when one party truly has a monopoly on being right. The sooner that politicians recognize this, the sooner they can get back to doing what they were elected to do.
