The Marshall School of Business announced a $3 million gift last week from Van Eck Global, a New York-based investment management firm. The gift will be allocated to support a student-run investment fund focused on asset allocation by utilizing exchange-traded funds, which will be administered by Marshall’s Center for Investment Studies.
Recently, the Undergraduate Student Investment Fund held an event attended by more than 100 students that aimed to educate students on the background of USIF, how to research and pitch stocks and general investment methodologies. Most of the USIF students will start careers in investment banking, portfolio management or equity research upon graduation this spring.
“We are very excited to forge strong links between Van Eck Global and the USC Marshall School of Business and the Center for Investment Studies,” said Jan van Eck, CEO, director and president of Van Eck Global, in a university press release. “We hope this gift will encourage Marshall students to pursue careers in the investment community.”
A select group of seniors are already getting the experience of managing a $1 million fund focused on equity investments for the university’s endowment as part of the USIF. The student portfolio managers are carefully selected through an application process; each is responsible for covering two sectors of stocks and pitching stocks at one of the four yearly meetings.
Members of USIF are also enrolled in a capstone class, Advanced Practicum in Portfolio Management, which is taught by professor Suh-Pyng Ku, who is also the director of the Center for Investment Studies.
Kathleen Siswanto, a senior majoring in business administration and biological sciences, commented on the merits of the USIF program.
“USIF has the reputation for attracting motivated students who are genuinely interested in understanding the markets,” Siswanto said. “This class is not for the faint [of] heart; Professor Ku will continuously challenge your ideas to make you a more thoughtful investor.”
Students are also exposed to the operational procedures of running a million-dollar fund. Each student must be involved in one of the following facets of running the fund: completion fund & risk management, portfolio reporting & accounting, trade execution, operations & compliance, marketing & recruiting and special projects.
Zach Bergenfeld, a senior majoring in business administration, said he appreciates Marshall’s commitment to practical experience.
“Marshall really prides experiential learning and hands-on learning … ‘what other way is there to manage a million dollars of real money if you’re passionate about investing in finance and then finance in general?’” Bergenfeld said.
The gift from van Eck, whose wife Cynthia graduated from USC in 1986, will allow future students to expand their investing horizon outside of traditional stocks and into exchange-traded funds.
ETFs differ from equity investments in that they provide an investor the opportunity to invest in a basket of securities that can help aid in diversification and thus lower risk. The ETF industry is expected to reach nearly $5 trillion in assets under management by 2020 according to a report by professional services firm PwC.
“This is a very significant gift for our student investment fund program. I’m thrilled for the students’ expanded learning opportunities in ETF asset allocation across a wide range of asset classes,” Ku added in a university press release.

Ending All Roads to Silence, a nonprofit organization started by seniors Natalie Tecimer and Eli Wininger, received a $368,000 grant to deliver medical technologies and services to hearing-impaired children.
After six months of negotiations, the Jamshetji Tata Trust has pledged to fund EARS’ efforts to bring hearing aids and cochlear implants to children in rural areas of southwest India. EARS serves a transnational advocacy network to help the hearing-impaired.
Tecimer, who is hearing-impaired herself, originally came up with the idea for EARS as a freshman while taking a course with Professor Steven Lamy called Saving Strangers Beyond Borders. For a class project, Tecimer constructed a proposal to address hearing impairment internationally. After reviewing her plan, Lamy encouraged her to put it into action. Tecimer then partnered with Wininger to recruit team members and become an official USC organization. In 2013, EARS became a registered 501(c)(3) nonprofit.
“There are a lot of deaf-advocacy groups, but we’re not one of them … We believe that hearing impairment is something that can be fixed,” Tecimer said. “Just like anything else, if you don’t have the right tools, [hearing impairment] can be crippling. If you don’t have the hearing aids, the cochlear implants, the speech therapy, and the tools in the classroom … and if you can’t advocate for yourself, then you are at a significant disadvantage. That’s why we want to connect people with these resources.”
Since its founding, EARS has raised $23,000, which has supplied 60 hearing aids of various power levels to 30 children in India. The organization worked with a Rotary club in southwest India to find a doctor and audiologist in the area.
Last March, Tecimer was one of five USC students selected to speak at the Board of Trustees conference as a part of a panel titled Courage to Make A Difference. At the conference, she was introduced to Ratan Tata, a member of the university’s Board of Trustees. Tata put Tecimer in touch with the managers of his trust to financially support EARS. Over the past six months, Tecimer collaborated via Skype with doctors from All India Institute of Speech and Hearing and representatives from Advanced Bionics, a global cochlear implant company, to select hearing aids and cochlear implants for children. The group determined that new waterproof models of hearing aids by Advanced Bionics would best meet the needs of the children they aim to help in India.
“You want to give something that’s sustainable,” Tecimer said. “[It’s] important for the kids to be able to accidentally drop their cochlear implant or take a shower with it by mistake and still know that it will work.”
In March, a delegation of EARS members, all USC students, will travel to India to oversee the distribution and installment of the hearing aids and cochlear implants. The $368,000 grant will establish a three-year program that will provide devices to 35 children in the Mysore community every year.
EARS has also had a local impact. During the fall of 2013, Tecimer and EARS developed a music program for hearing-impaired students at Farmdale Elementary School in the Lincoln Heights neighborhood. The six-week program helped a group of 12 8-year-old students overcome stigma of hearing loss and encouraged them to interact with other students. In addition, participating in musical activities, such as drumming, allowed the students to experiment with different sounds. Recently, the EARS program was approved by the Los Angeles Unified School District Special Education Local Plan Areas and received funding from the district to expand its implementation.
“It was a music group, but it wasn’t only about the music … It was more about the kids getting in touch with how they hear. It makes them more educated when they talk to their audiologist … the transformation was cool.”
On Saturday, EARS held its fourth annual benefit concert at Ground Zero Performance Café to raise awareness for the cause.
“Being a part of the EARS has changed my perception of hearing impairment. Before we started the organization, it wasn’t something I thought of often,” said Wininger, a senior majoring in business administration and accounting. “I don’t look at hearing impairment as a disability anymore … It’s something people can easily overcome with the right tools and the right guidance.”
Correction: A previous version of this story stated that a Rotary club in India partnered with EARS to distribute hearing aids. The Rotary club actually worked with EARS to find a doctor and audiologist in India. The Daily Trojan regrets the error.

The Dept. of Public Safety hosted the grand opening of a Little Free Library in the University Gardens Housing development on Saturday near the intersection of Jefferson Boulevard and Vermont Avenue.
A program that began as a stationary bookcase that a Wisconsin man built to memorialize his former schoolteacher-mother has led to the creation of more than 15,000 Little Free Libraries around the world. With its tagline, “take a book, return a book,” the program aims to promote literacy and education, especially in low-income and rural areas. The Little Free Library, installed near the University Park campus on Saturday, is the first one in the neighborhood.
Jean and Doug Chadwick, long-time volunteers for A Chance for Children, have been establishing libraries in Los Angeles and  Ohio, particularly in police stations.
“One thing we could accomplish with this was the opportunity to promote literacy by providing books that are free to kids who potentially don’t have access to books,” Jean said. “Secondly, we can start to change the dynamic in the police stations. Lots of these stations handle child custody handoffs so you have very stressful situations and adults who don’t behave well. These kids would come in and be crying. But now they can come, turn a corner, and sit in the library while their parents do whatever.”
A handyman of sorts, Doug has hand-built more than 20 bookcases, including the two in University Gardens. One is a stationary box erected on pole, and the other is a larger bookcase that has wheels. Both are Dr. Seuss-themed. All the libraries the Chadwicks have built are registered with the national Little Free Libraries organization so each has a plaque and shows up on the global directory should anyone want to locate them.
DPS Chief John Thomas, a former LAPD officer, caught wind of the program when several were placed in LAPD station lobbies. He was also inspired by a boy named Muhanned, whom he met while patrolling University Gardens, when Muhanned asked for books for his birthday.
“I thought it was a shame that you’ve got kids asking for books when right across the street is one of the greatest American universities,” Thomas said. “Either these kids can aspire to go to USC or look at USC as an unattainable dream.”
Consequently, Thomas made sure that the library opening coincided with Muhanned’s birthday.
Thomas emphasized the fact that DPS not only patrols to keep USC students safe, but also to protect residents who live in the surrounding community.
“That’s how you get safe neighborhoods. It’s not by putting people in jail; it’s by making people aware of their neighbors and getting to know the police that work for their neighborhood. There’s a lot to the safety aspect that involves community relationships,” he said.
He added that there will be various involvement opportunities for USC students, such as tutoring and reading books to local children.
Thomas attributed much of the installment of the library to DPS Community Relations Officer Elizabeth Carreño, who took the initiative to make it a reality by contacting and partnering with A Chance for Children, as well as the Water Buffalo Club. The Water Buffalo Club is nonprofit philanthropic organization in Los Angeles that funds various projects, such as these libraries. The executive director, Shelly Wood, attended the event.
“We have funded 12 Little Free Libraries. And we really do anything that has to do with children. Plus, a lot of our Water Buffalo members are Trojan alumni so we’d love to stay involved,” Wood said.
The library opening was attended by many local kids through the literary program, Kinder2College. The event kicked off with face-painting and balloon-twisting. Donning a Dr. Seuss hat, Thomas gave an introductory speech and, after passing out lunch, read Dr. Seuss books to the children in attendance. Thomas also asked Muhanned to take the stage where the boy received a book about frogs that he had wanted, and a chorus of “Happy Birthday” from the crowd.

The 27th Annual USC Libraries Scripter Award, a black-tie gala event, was held at Doheny Memorial Library on Saturday evening to commemorate the screenwriters and authors of the year’s best-adapted films.
Graham Moore, screenwriter of The Imitation Game, and Andrew Hodges, author of the film’s source material Alan Turing: The Enigma, won the Scripter Award for best adapted screenplay. The Scripter Award brought together various prominent figures in academia, publishing, and film.
The other four nominees for the Scripter Award included author and screenwriter Gillian Flynn for Gone Girl; author Thomas Pynchon and screenwriter Paul Thomas Anderson for Inherent Vice; author Jane Hawking and screenwriter Anthony McCarten’s The Theory of Everything; and author Cheryl Strayed and screenwriter Nick Hornby for Wild.
“I’ll tell you every writer’s dream,” Moore said. “If you want to write for the screen, there’s this actor and, if you get him to deliver your lines, it turns out anything you write seems really witty, smart and brilliant, and his name is Benedict Cumberbatch.”
Moore expressed gratitude to Alan Turing, the WWII-era mathematician whose life provided the basis for The Imitation Game.
“He never got to stand on a stage and hear people applaud for his name,” Moore said. “That is a profound injustice, and all that I can do now is to spend the rest of my life endeavoring to repair it. This is for him.”
Ariel Sobel, a sophomore majoring in writing for film screen and television, acknowledged the shortcomings of the movie,  however, discussing how Turing’s character was not as accurately depicted as she had hoped.
“I think The Imitation Game was a truly great story that needed to be told. I only wish that the film had focused less on WWII,” Sobel said. “[Moore] talked about how [Turing] wasn’t recognized for his work, but the film itself doesn’t focus on that. I wish the film could’ve spoken on how Turing, a genius, was misunderstood and mistreated by society for being a homosexual.”
Students who saw the movie say that it gave them a good reference point as to how society has evolved in its acceptance of gay rights.
“I know a lot of people who have seen [The Imitation Game],” said Sucharita Yellapragada, a sophomore studying policy, planning and development. “It has a great storyline and it really highlights how our perception of homosexuality has changed over the years.”
Walter Mosley, who has authored more than 40 fiction books and is most well-known for his Easy Rawlins crime series, was awarded the Scripter Literary Achievement award.
He spoke about how libraries were challenged to halt circulation of certain books after 9/11.
“After 9/11, personal freedoms started to get limited in all sorts of different ways,” Mosley said. “There were people being arrested, questioned, and listened to. And that president, Mr. Bush, sent out a memo to the libraries saying, ‘We need to know who’s reading what. Who’s reading books about building bombs, or books about Islam, or books that may be considered anti-American.’ And librarians said, ‘F-ck you. No, we’re not gonna do that.’”
Furthermore, Mosley expressed how unregulated libraries reflect the role of American freedom.
“And that dawned on me … I realized that libraries were the last bastion in America to stand up for our freedom. Our freedom is mainly an intellectual thing,” Mosley said. “You stop and think. You say, ‘This woman is free to read, think, say, and do what she wants.’ If we make libraries stronger, we make America stronger.”
Catherine Quinlan, dean of the USC Libraries, described the awards ceremony as an ongoing tradition that has brought together a community of librarians and storytellers.
“Scripter has grown into an exceptional tradition for our libraries, our university, and for the entire Trojan family,” Quinlan said. “Throughout its 27-year history, Scripter has been a tremendously inexhaustible spirit of two vital communities: the most dedicated supporters of our libraries, and the cinematic storytellers who advance in delight in the art of adaptation. One of the most gratifying aspects of Scripter … is that it brings together those two groups in the grand space of this wonderful library.”

The USC Trojans men’s basketball team came very close to turning the corner last Thursday night in their game against the Colorado Buffaloes. A thriller that ended after three overtimes and in bitter fashion, the showdown between the Trojans and the Buffs was USC’s most resilient effort under  second-year coach Andy Enfield.
The Trojans came out strong in the first half, building an early double-digit lead behind a strong shooting performance from redshirt sophomore guard Katin Reinhardt and some nifty post moves from second-year big man Nikola Jovanovic. Colorado was able to whittle down the deficit to one point to end to the half and carried that momentum straight into the second period, going on a run right away.
As Colorado took the lead and the Trojans struggled to keep pace, any USC basketball fan who has watched the program over the last 10 years could recognize what was happening. Regardless of the coach and the players, USC is somehow plagued almost every game by four-minute to                   six-minute dry spells, during which they struggle to put the ball in the basket. While most college basketball fans can attribute this phenomenon to their team as well, the Trojans seem to be especially adept at going into these funks at the worst possible times.
This is a hallmark of every USC team, both good and bad. The only difference with the more successful Trojan squads is their ability to fight their way back into the game after scoring droughts. The best example of this is the Trojans’ 2009 Pac-10 tournament clinching victory over a nationally ranked, James Harden-led Arizona State basketball team. USC came out and was down 15 at halftime, going through multiple periods of immense struggle to buy a basket.
Yet they somehow clawed their way back and won a   tightly-contested game. That was one of the two or three best USC basketball teams in the last 10 years, and their resilience was a key factor in their success. As the team has struggled in more recent years, that characteristic has been conspicuously absent.
This year, there have been signs. A valiant comeback effort against Stanford and locking up the Oregon State Beavers in the second half were two games in the which the young Trojan team showed some mettle. The team’s biggest test came with eight minutes left in Thursday night’s battle. The Trojans had just gone more than four minutes without scoring and were down 61-50.
With little at stake in terms of conference standings or tournament implications, USC could have easily folded. Instead, the Trojans brought up the intensity and played their best eight minutes of basketball this season. On defense, they forced Colorado to take bad shots late in the shot clock, got into passing lanes and deflected balls and played with a true vigor for the game. On offense, they found the hot-handed Reinhardt, who finished the game with a record-tying nine single-game 3-pointers and got the ball down low to Jovanovic who was highly effective with his post moves.
With less than a minute left, the Trojans executed their best out of timeout call this year. Feeding the ball to the high post to then dump it down to Jovanovic for a beautiful            left-handed finish tied up the game and marked the end of an eight-minute 16-5 run for USC.
While the Trojans would ultimately fall in the third overtime, the fight and grit that USC showed demonstrates marked improvement in the team. The team wasn’t helped out by suspect officiating or Colorado guard Askia Booker’s career night, but they still found a way to battle back after every bad call.
Unless you can keep pace with Kentucky’s recruiting prowess, developing fundamentally sound and mentally tough four-year players is the best way to succeed in the current climate of college basketball. Virginia is just the latest test case to demonstrate the validity of the model. The Trojans are young and have some pieces to make some noise in a year or two if they can continue to showcase resilience and grit.
Obviously, winning only one game in conference play isn’t the mark of a powerhouse, but it’s important to look at the positive aspects. Thursday’s game foreshadows a bright future for the squad. Sure, there were issues with late-game decision-making on offense and undisciplined loose ball fouls on defense, but those are growing pains any young team will experience.
The team might not have turned the corner on Thursday night, but they came so close. As long as they are improving, that counts for something.

The USC women’s basketball team is facing a four-game losing streak for the first time since coach Cynthia Cooper-Dyke became head coach. The losses have come at the hands of top-ranked teams, including the Beavers, at No. 7 and Stanford, at No. 15.
Oregon State University (19-1, 9-0 Pac-12) dominated the night with offensive and defensive prowess, stunting USC 68-35.
“Their half court offense was definitely a strength of theirs; they execute quite efficiently,”       Cooper-Dyke said. “They made us play 20 to 25 seconds of defense every time down.”
The Women of Troy (11-9, 3-6 Pac-12) showed promise in the beginning. Though they never had a lead, USC responded to the OSU and tied with the Beavers three times. Then USC began to miss shots.
The dry spell gave the Beavers time to make plenty of mistakes and they also went cold offensively for four minutes. Then OSU got back into an offensive groove while the Women of Troy continued to miss shots.
“We were taking a lot of quick shots,” junior forward Kaneisha Horn said. “Oregon State, they just executed.”
The effort in the Beavers did not stop the fight in the Women of Troy. USC still collected several rebounds that gave missing shots second chances. Horn scored 10 points and five rebounds; sophomore guard Brianna Barrett came up second in scoring for the Trojans at seven points and managed to commit three steals.
“We did really well defensively,” senior forward Alexyz Vaioletama said. “What hurt us was offense. We had a couple of open shots, we took them, but they just didn’t fall.”
The Trojan offense was crippled by the blocks from 6’6” center Ruth Hamblin. The stalwart used her wingspan to deny the offensive efforts of six Trojans throughout both halves. Hamblin acquired eight blocks Saturday night.
“Their guards would force our guards to penetrate into the defense of Hamblin,” Cooper-Dyke said. “It was a tough process to overcome.”
The Beavers forced the Women of Troy to make difficult shots. Barrett launched the only successful 3-point shot; OSU sank five from beyond the arc in the first half. The Beavers lead 27 to 15 at halftime. The Trojans shot just 21 percent in the first half.
The Women of Troy earned 10 points in the paint and the bench also contributed four points in the first half.
“In the first half we played solid defense; we held them to 27 points,” Cooper-Dyke said. “Then we couldn’t execute offensively,”
The second half started on a bad note for USC. The Beavers would produce five more points before Vaioletama landed a lay up.  Then the Women of Troy suffered from missed shots and the iron-curtain defense of Hamblin.
Scoring came easily for the Beavers. Guard Jamie Weisner earned 21 points and four rebounds, while forward Deven Hunter racked in 15 points and 10 rebounds.
“We didn’t do a very good job with getting back on defense,” Cooper-Dyke said. “It’s one thing to get back and be in the paint, but Oregon State is a team that has players that stood out by the 3-point line and start up the shot,”
The Beavers moved the ball effectively and landed many shots from beyond the arc. USC found opportunities to score points through free throws, gaining a team total of 6 points from the key.
Freshmen forward Amy Okonkwo managed a pair of layups and redshirt sophomore Jordan Adams also scored down low. However, USC’s efforts were no match for the Beavers offensive flood and defensive dam.
“We were just outplayed,” said Vaioletama. “For Monday we really need to work on our offensive game.”
The Women of Troy will face the Oregon Ducks on Monday, Feb. 2 at 5 p.m. The Ducks are (9-11, 2-7 Pac-12) are currently No.9  in the Pac-12. They come off a close win against the UCLA Bruins 67-65.
“We got to pick up the pieces from a tough loss and work on the things that we do well,”           Cooper-Dyke said. “We’ve got to finish better when we do have those opportunities underneath the basket. That’s gonna be big for us.”

After sailing through the ITA Kick-off Weekend at home with 4-0 wins against both Louisiana and Santa Clara, the USC men’s tennis squad returned to the courts in Athens, Georgia for the Pac-12/SEC Showdown.  The Trojans faced off against the No. 17 Florida Gators on Saturday.
The Trojans began their match against the ranked Gators with a hard fought 2-0 victory for the doubles point.  Junior Max de Vroome and senior Eric Johnson paired up and took down Gators Maxx Lipman and Elliott Orkin by a score of 6-4.  Then, seniors Yannick Hanfmann and Roberto Quiroz clinched the doubles point for the Trojans, outlasting Florida’s Diego Hidalgo and Gordon Watson in a close 7-6 (5) win.  Oliver Landert and Joshua Wardell from Florida were up 6-5 on sophomores Nick Crystal and Connor Farren before play was suspended.
In the singles matches, the Trojans continued to have the upper hand despite tough competition from Florida.  Quiroz earned the first singles point for the Trojans and finished off Orkin in two sets with a score of 6-2, 7-5.  Hanfmann lost his first set 5-7 to Lipman, but put the Trojans up 2-0 in singles play with a strong comeback and won 6-4 and 6-1 in the second and third sets.
It wasn’t long until the Gators came storming back to knot the singles score at two points apiece.  Senior Jonny Wang dominated his first set against Hidalgo, winning 6-0, but Hidalgo created problems for Wang in the next two sets.  Hidalgo edged Wang in the second set 7-6 (2) before controlling the decisive third set, winning 6-3 and giving the Gators their first singles win of the match.  The Gators tied the singles score soon after when Watson beat Johnson in a closely contested three set match.  Like Wang, Johnson took victory in the opening set, winning 6-4 over Watson.  The next two sets would need a tiebreaker to determine the winner of the set.  In both sets, Watson bested Johnson   ([7-6 (3) in the second set and 7-6 (4) in the third set]) and brought the Gators to within one point of the Trojans in overall play.
Despite the two straight wins by the Gators, the Trojans would clinch the match a short time later when Crystal took down Landert in two sets with a score of 6-2, 7-5.  Sophomore Rob Bellamy capped off the day for the Trojans with a three-set victory over Jordan Belga, giving the Trojans a 5-2 victory.  With the win, the Trojans moved to 4-0 overall on the season.
USC men’s tennis coach Peter Smith was proud of how his team was able to handle the challenge of facing a tough Gators squad.
“The conditions were fast and Florida fought really well,”  Smith said.  “Florida was a big step ahead for us in competition.  Good for us to get these matches under our belt.”
Smith also noted that the game was a positive transition for his team.
“Today was a day of getting used to this level and people in new positions,” Smith said.  “We are here to get better and we took a step in that direction.”
Next week, the Trojans will return home to take on the UC Irvine Anteaters and the San Diego State Aztecs in a Saturday back-to-back matchup.  These two matches will be the final matches for the Trojans before the ITA National Team Indoor Championships.
UC Irvine is 2-5 on the season and has lost its last three matches, including a 4-0 loss to UCLA back on Jan. 21.  Both of UC Irvine’s wins came on the road against the Arizona Wildcats.  In their losses, the Anteaters have never won more than two matches against their opponent.
The San Diego State Aztecs have started the season strong.  They dominated their season opening, back-to-back matchups against the UC Riverside (won 7-0) and UC San Diego (won 6-1).  The Aztecs fell to Utah State on the road 3-4, but got back in the win column five days later with a 4-3 victory over Cal Poly.

The USC Trojans (9-12, 1-8 Pac-12) were blown out by the No. 11 Utah Utes (17-4, 7-2) by a score of 67-39.
The Utes dominated from start to finish, jumping out to an early 20-point first-half lead and never looking back. The Trojans, who entered the game fresh off a heartbreaking triple-overtime loss to the Colorado Buffaloes last Thursday, came out sluggish and never got their offense going.
Utah played spectacular defense in the first half, holding the Trojans to 12 points on 19 percent shooting from the field. Led by 7-foot-one Austrian center Jakob Poeltl, the Utes dominated in the paint, bullying their way to 22 points in the paint and 19 first-half rebounds.
While USC has been inconsistent with their offense throughout the season, their defense has been able keep them competitive. The Utes were able to shoot 45 percent from the field and had 9 second-chance points, however, which brought them to a 32-12 first-half lead.
“We didn’t play well in the first half. A lot had to do with what Utah was doing and a lot to do with what we weren’t doing,” head coach Andy Enfield said. “We missed some shots. I thought our defense played not [terribly].”
After his starters fell behind by as much as 29 points in the second half, Enfield decided to give his bench a chance to make something happen with 16 minutes left in the game.
Over the next six minutes, the Trojan bench would lead a spirited 13-1 run that saw USC climb to just a 17-point deficit, sparking Utah to return their starters to the game.
“I was very proud of our bench coming in and increasing the energy and increasing the productivity. Really proud of those guys. They came in and did what we needed to do,” Enfield said.
Unfortunately, a quick 12-2 run by the Utes all but sealed a victory with just five minutes to play.
Just one game after combining for over 65 point, redshirt sophomore guard Katin Reinhardt and sophomore forward Nikola Jovanovic really struggled to find their shot against a stout Utah defense. Jovanovic was held under double digits for the first time in over 10 games and Reinhardt had one of his worst games in recent memory with just 6 points and one assist.
Freshman point guard Jordan McLaughlin’s struggles continued. The guard has yet to put together a solid game since returning from an ugly elbow injury. McLaughlin was held scoreless on 0-7 shooting and recorded his first game without an assist. Enfield also held his star guard to just six minutes in the second half.
“We have extreme confidence in Jordan. I’m sure he will start making a higher percentage of his shots. Unfortunately he’s just had a hard time getting some shots in,” Enfield said. “We’re not down on him at all. He’s going to be a special player in this league. He’s just going through a slump right now.”
Forward Malik Martin led the Trojans with 11 points, two rebounds, two steals and a block. Martin had arguably his best game as a Trojan and was a main component of USC’s second-half comeback push.
The Utes had 11 players score, including three in double digits. Poeltl led Utah with 14 points and nine rebounds. Leading scorer Delon Wright chipped in 11 points, five rebounds and three steals, rounding out a great         all-around performance from the Utes.
USC had a hard time dealing with Utah’s size advantage. The Trojans were held to 27 percent shooting from the field, were outscored in the paint 38-18 and out-rebounded 39-26. With a lack of size down low, the Trojans have been exposed by numerous Pac-12 teams, Utah being the latest.
USC has lost six straight games and sits last in the      Pac-12 standings. The Trojans will make the short trip up to the Bay Area this week to take on the Cal and Stanford. The Trojans tip off against the Bears this Thursday, Feb. 5 at 8 p.m. USC’s last win came against the Bears almost a month ago on Jan. 7.

After listening to the first few bars of the second song, the problem becomes apparent: Sam Smith’s “Stay With Me” is indeed strikingly similar to the 26-year-old Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers hit “I Won’t Back Down.” The basic melody behind the verses “Oh, won’t you stay with me?” and “Well, I won’t back down” are the same. They are performed at different speeds and with different emotion, but the musical backbone of the songs are the same. This week, Petty and his co-writer for “I Won’t Back Down,” Jeff Lynne were awarded a combined 25 percent of the royalties to “Stay With Me” with what amounted to no opposition from the Smith camp. Petty released a statement to the effect of “these things happen” by calling the whole affair a “musical accident.” Rarely do these disputes resolve themselves so neatly.
Also this week, Warner Bros. Entertainment and New Line Cinema made headlines because a federal judge dismissed a lawsuit that accused them of intellectual theft. To summarize, author Tess Gerritsen says that the script for Alfonso Cuarón’s space rollercoaster, Gravity, is not an original creation of Cuarón’s — as Warner Bros., claims — rather, that it is based on her 1999 novel of the same name. She claims that she signed a deal to have that book produced into a film, and that Cuarón was attached to the project but that it was ultimately scrapped. Then, she claims, Gravity some years later pops up, shares considerable plot elements with her story and features the same Cuarón as the writer of the new original screenplay. Though the case was dismissed in court, Gerritsen continues to fight, and there is a good chance that things will get messy. Gerritsen has 20 days to resubmit her case, which she will surely do, and if Cuarón was indeed attached to the New Line project of her film back in 2008, it could be pretty damning. This would be a shame, especially with a film that exhibits the technical creativity that Gravity does. Cuarón and master cinematographer Emmanuel Lubezki, who each won a well-deserved Oscar for their efforts, developed trailblazing cinematic techniques while filming Sandy Bullock tumbling in space — a scene that Gerritsen claims to have written — and darting through the corridors of the International Space Station. There is a reason that the film won seven Oscars, trailing only Cabaret (1972) for the most ever for a film that didn’t win Best Picture. It would be a shame if Gerritsen’s claims were proved true because it seems absurd that such a talented team would reduce themselves to such petty antics.
Smith’s agreement with Petty is a breath of fresh air. Accusations of plagiarism have been part of pop culture since the beginning, and the results usually veer towards the uglier side of the spectrum where denials, lawsuits and the Gravity proceedings currently reside. When George Harrison was accused of plagarizing The Chiffons’s 1962 “He’s So Fine” for his own “My Sweet Lord,” it took an entire court case to settle the matter. The plagiarism was so obvious that the judge presiding over the proceedings felt the need to declare at the end of the trial that Harrison’s first single as a solo artist was “the very same song as ‘He’s So Fine’ with different words.” Anyone who listens to the two songs can hear that in five seconds, but it took five years to settle in court.
Another way that these things can turn is towards the absurd. Perhaps the quirkiest case of this was when Fantasy Records sued John Fogerty for plagiarizing his own 1970 composition “Run Through the Jungle” for his 1985 hit “The Old Man Down the Road.” But, much more than a 30-year-old Fogerty song, the plagarism scandal that people will now remember is the farce that ensued after Shia LaBeouf was accused of plagiarizing Daniel Clowe’s comic Justin M. Damiano in late 2013. Shia LaBeouf’s subsequent apology consisted of word-for-word recreations of other public apologies from the likes of Tiger Woods, Robert MacNamara and Kanye West. He then tried to start a conversation about plagiarism and the nature of creativity itself. LaBeouf’s artistic credibility is nonexistent, and he’s become a bit of a cultural oddity thanks to his antics.
As painful as it is to say it, however, LaBeouf brought up some very interesting points about the creative process. The line between “inspired by” and “copied from” is more blurred than one realizes, and it can hinder creativity if an artist has to stop and wonder if their new creation is too similar to another work that came before. For example, if one of Smith’s producers had caught the similarity between his song and Petty’s in the recording booth and pointed it out, would it have caused him to try and shoehorn in some changes so that his song would be more different? Would he have scrapped the song? “Stay With Me” is a great, albeit overplayed, song in its own right, and it very well could’ve been stifled by fears of plagiarism.
If the allegations against Cuarón and Warner Bros. are true, then the implications are even darker, as the end result was much closer to the alleged source material than Sam Smith’s tune. And yet, similar questions to those from the Sam Smith conversation arise. Gravity is definitely a film that we are better off having. It is a stunning spectacle, and it is very possible that Warner Bros. would have shied away from producing it had it had the stigma of being a film stuck in production hell for a few years when Cuarón pitched it to them.
If Gerritsen’s work indeed turns out to be the basis for the film then naturally she should be given her due. It does raise interesting questions, however, that would perhaps had been more in the forefront if they hadn’t been coming from the voice of a former child actor wearing a paper bag reading “I am not famous anymore” over his head on the red carpet.

As one of the most prominent events in American entertainment, the Super Bowl is a highlight for sports fans each year. With one’s favorite football teams, remarkable and vivacious entertainers and raucous fan energy, the yearly event captures the attention of millions all across the country. Despite the more obvious things to look forward to, one of the most highly anticipated aspects and widely-discussed topics is advertising. Whether hilarious or heartfelt, Super Bowl advertisements add to the spectacle of the nation’s favorite sports day.
The Mophie “All-Powerless” commercial might be one of the most comical and satirically accurate of the Super Bowl ads. This ad makes fun of the chaos and helplessness that people feel when their phone batteries die. A feeling that, the ad claims, even God understands. At the end of the ad, God even holds his own battery-drained phone. Clips of spontaneous combustion and an animal invasion exaggerate how chaotic the world becomes for some people when their phones die. A strong and well-produced ad, this media push connects well with our increasingly technology-dependent nation.
Everyone knows and loves funny-gal Mindy Kaling, and she definitely doesn’t disappoint in her Nationwide ad for Super Bowl Sunday. In her classic dry character, Mindy struts around New York, under the pretense that she is invisible. Between tanning naked in Central Park to the second most surprising Matt Damon appearance in media over the last year, Kaling keeps her flawlessly funny cool and delivers a quite a media “touchdown.”
Kim Kardashian makes an appearance with her T-Mobile commercial. Somewhat controversial, the ad involves Kardashian making fun of her self-obsessed nature. She advertises for the loss of data, saying that people could be using all the lost data to look at her selfies, outfits and makeup. Kardashian has had significant backlash for this ad, considering her position in the media as a self-obsessed fame monster. No matter how taboo her commercial is, however, it still has won her the attention she so desires from the public.
More celebrities make their football-day debut in the Super Bowl media world with the new BMW I3 ad. Katie Couric and Bryant Gumbel poke fun at the idea of getting used to a bigger and newer concept. Flashbacks from their early days as journalists give a hint of comedy as they question whether or not the Internet will be a “big thing.” Who knows if that will happen with the BMW I3, but the company sure knows how to make a point.
Some of the beer commercials each year are the most outrageous and famous in history. This year, Bud Light brings in a classic ad that features bright lights, bars and popping bottle caps. Additionally, we cannot forget the heart-melting Budweiser ad — we all know that the company loves to use that beautiful puppy to make us “ooh and ah.” This year’s campaign is especially tear-inducing: the little puppy ends up lost and on a journey to reunite with his Clydesdale buddies. Dirty and wet, he is almost attacked by a wolf but is saved by his noble equestrian friends. Truly moving and uplifting, the ad looks to be a favorite of all favorites.
Another touching ad is the Dove Men+Care commercial. Grabbing hearts with the right touch of nostalgia, it emphasizes the importance of men and what it takes to be a dad. It is a real tear-jerker for any college student who misses their parents.
On a more serious and important note, No More released an ad addressing sexual assault and domestic violence. The ad sheds light onto an issue that hinders many families across the nation. The ad outlines a phone call to a 9-1-1 operator who figures out the hidden message in a woman’s seemingly calm call. It is an amazing representation of how issues of assault or violence often lurk behind doors and avenues one would never think to look at. This media push for the education in domestic violence and sexual assault is a positive step into the direction of eradicating the discomfort around reporting these crimes.
No matter which ad ends up being your favorite, there are ads for the whole family and every mood. Whether one wants to laugh at Kaling swiping a stranger’s cookie, cry over the importance of dads or enjoy both sentiments, Super Bowl commercials are some of the best moments of entertainment.

Dear President Nikias:
By now I’m sure you’re well aware of a video circulating throughout USC’s social media that shows you being confronted by an employee of the university, imploring you to see the inescapability of a life based on $11 an hour.
To be honest, I can understand why you acted the way you did in the video. You were confronted, noticed you had cameras on you, and felt ambushed. You were — that’s just good organizing. And I understand how in that moment you might have known that you couldn’t say anything to Abigail Lopez because anything you said would be scrutinized very heavily. Possibly by students, likely by faculty — but certainly by the University’s Board of Trustees.
Perhaps you even feared saying almost anything at all would create a whirlwind of chaos on the University’s Board of Trustees, sabotage the school’s negotiations with Local 11, leaving you smack dab in the middle of it.
I understand that moment. But I ask you now, as an undergraduate student enrolled at USC, to seriously consider what Abigail Lopez’s plea means, and how you, as chief of the largest private employer in southern California, can dramatically improve the lives of thousands of Los Angeles residents very easily.
Imagine for a second, what your life would be like you if didn’t have more than a million dollars and a university to back you up, and instead made $19,200 each year. I mean it. I implore you to imagine what life is like when you are a single parent with two children, two jobs, and a $1,600-monthly budget. Think about the logistics; getting from job to job, while making sure your children are where they need to be and properly cared for. Or think about the challenge of making sure everyone is fed, when rent alone devours more than half your paycheck. Not to forget the electricity, gasoline and, if there’s anything left, a birthday gift for your daughter.
I understand if you can’t. For those of us privileged enough to have been born to circumstances that enable a life not terrorized by the fear of eviction, it’s impossible to really understand what it’s like to get up at 3:30 a.m. to board a bus to get to work at 5, enlisting your mother to care for your kids until school starts at 7:30. It’s impossible for us to imagine getting home at night, unable to even say goodnight to our children because they are already fast-asleep, not having seen us once during their waking hours.
It’s impossible for us, but it’s reality millions for working people across the country every single day.
And it’s a reality for thousands of people right here, employed by the University of Southern California.
Right now the University is locked in negotiations with Unite Here Local 11 Service Union. Their demand for a $15-an-hour working wage has been deemed untenable by the University. You may think that paying the workers who compose the foundation of our university’s functionality as little as possible is just a part of running a large institution.
But I think if you took a stand in favor of paying your employees a living wage, you would find overwhelming amount of support for your decision among students, staff, faculty, alumni, and even some Trustees.
As a student, and a member of the Trojan Family, I ask you simply to take a stand with the workers who keep our university running. I ask you to publicly declare your support of a living wage for the campus workers who maintain our beautiful campus, and feed our students for a living; a wage they and their families deserve.
We pride ourselves on being a university of “innovation” and “progress.” Why then, are we so intent on being one with archaic values that permit treating those who make our institution possible so poorly? If USC wants to be No. 1, why don’t we make the choice to become the first university in the country to pay its workers a living wage?
I, and so many others, would be much more proud to be affiliated with a university that dignifies itself on being the only institution in the entire country to pay its workers a living wage, rather than one that boasts about having the most collegiate-gothic buildings.

It is amazing that no one is talking about, at least the ball park figure, how much does it cost for USC to accept the demands? I have been asking people around to calculate this simple number but for some mysterious reason nobody is able to come up with that number. 
Based on poverty line of LA county, I think each worker need to get at least $10000 more to survive. That would be 8 million USD every year for 800 workers. 
There are 40000 students on campus. So $200 per year per student tution fee increase.
There are around 4000 faculty on campus. So a $2000 per year per faculty salary decrease. 
Alternatively an endowment fund can be created where our strong alumni can donate. Frats and sororities can forgo some parties to donate that money. Churches have a lot of money, I heard. There are various NGOs who has money. 
Before all this, is there no accountant worth his/her salt to dig through USC accounts to identify the frivolous spending by USC in the name of concerts, conquest etc and find at least some money out of 8 million? 
Is there such a debate going on which I missed?
Naga.. established employers don’t determine wages based on resource availability.  They don’t even determine wages based on the needs of the employee.  Nor should they.  Think of how silly the world would be if employers were required to pay employees whatever the employees deem is enough to maintain a healthy lifestyle.  That’s absurd.  Employers pay market value for the skills required by the job, or they suffer from (a) a noncompetitive work force, or (b) no work force at all.  That’s capitalism for ya.  It is not the employers fault that the market is saturated with unskilled or underskilled workers.  A market saturated with unskilled or underskilled workers is not the employer’s responsibility.
Here’s a better idea.. don’t have three kids when you can’t afford even one.  If you’re in a position that requires you to provide for more individuals than yourself with a low paying, hourly job, live in an area that isn’t one of the most expensive places in the US (e.g., don’t live in or near downtown Los Angeles, or anywhere in California for that matter).  Or work two jobs, if you have to.  If you can’t live in a cheaper area for whatever reason, and/or you can’t work multiple jobs, obtain skills to make yourself more marketable for higher paying jobs.
I will also say this – the types of jobs that pay $11/hr aren’t meant to provide income for an entire family.  They’re transitional jobs.  Jobs for teenagers.  Or students.  But employers cannot legally discriminate based on age.  Put plainly, employers are legally obligated to hire ppl they do not necessarily want to hire or do not necessarily think they should hire.  So think of how ridiculous it is to demand higher wages from your employer for a job your employer thinks should be done by a 15 year old.  And to confront the employer and record it in an attempt to strong arm him/her via humiliation is even more absurd.
There is absolutely nothing to disagree with what you said. After reading your reply I noticed that I didn’t articulate my idea clearly. 
I wanted to appeal to the human side of all of us. Please note that I am entirely emphasizing the solution to this based on “donation” or “charity”. I didn’t put it in proper terms in my previous comment. Let me try again. 
Markets work precisely the way you described, I can’t beat that description. However, I want to talk about the humans who end up with the low skill jobs. Thanks to minimum wage farce, many such employees will never find a chance to acquire any skill that market actually needs and demands. (Due to accident of birth, they can’t afford good institutional training and due to minimum wage law, small businesses can’t hire them where they can acquire the skills on the job) 
Contrary to popular belief, a substantial portion of our future is determined when and where we are born. Yes, through hard work and dedication people can change that. A lazy person born in relatively well-to-do family and society will do better than his counterpart in poor family. 
My point is this: it is ridiculously unfair to expect the poor to work too much just because they were born into circumstances beyond their control. 
My suggestion to solve this problem is a call for the “Trojan Family” to “donate” for the wages. I was merely exploring the options to raise 8 million dollars. I agree my last comment sounded “socialistic” for which I apologize :) 
I, for one, don’t even think that there is an obligation on University administration to solve this problem administratively i.e by raising wages to pay extra for the work. My appeal is to the so called “Trojan Family” spirit to find a way to raise 8 million dollars a year so that the workers survive and also provide skill training to these workers (in a three year time frame?) for which market can pay decent wages to them. With our diversified and talented student body, I am sure we can figure out ways to solve this humanely and sustain-ably (i.e by not going against markets). 
A family never abandons one of its own.
This is a good point.  The human aspect behind minimum wage laws is important.  I was thinking about this yesterday and have somewhat changed my perspective.  I have always viewed minimum wage laws as a requirement of an employer to pay an employee, at minimum, X amount of money.  But you can also think of minimum wage laws as being a requirement of the employee to sell his/her work to the employer for, at minimum, X amount of money.  In other words, some people out there may legitimately be okay with a very low standard of living, and could feasibly work on the cheap if not for minimum wage laws.  But that hurts the other employee working in the same industry who is not okay with that very low standard of living.  That’s where I think it is unfair to have a very low minimum wage.
That being said, I still think certain jobs should be exempt from having a minimum wage that corresponds with a living wage.  For example, jobs that are traditionally held by teenagers, students, etc.  The problem, then, is that those jobs would not be available to unskilled older people who need SOME job to gain income.  Idk, that’s where I sort of struggle with how I perceive minimum wage laws.  It feels like certain employers should be able to pay lower than a living wage, in part because the majority of their work force isn’t relying on their pay as a living wage.  That’s why, to me, it seems like the most fair route is to compensated employees for the market value of the skills required to perform the job.  But there are of course always extenuating circumstances, which makes this topic a very difficult one to address.  I’m glad I’m not a lawmaker, that’s for sure :p
This is false. The minimum wage was ALWAYS engineered to be a living wage, and up until the last half century, households were NOT penalized for not having dual incomes. That’s ignoring decades of American growth and a robust middle-class, often with stay-at-home parents. 
Also, you’re wrong about the wages. The majority of minimum wage workers are not teenagers, they’re adults. And they’re not 21. They’re over 30. The minimum wage was never designed for teenagers, it was designed for adults. I’m not sure where you are getting this garbage from.
Facts would help your argument.
Will.. the first attempt to establish a statutory national minimum wage in the US was for 0.25 dollars/hour.  It was ruled unconstitutional and failed.  The second attempt to establish a minimum wage in the US was also for 0.25 dollars/hour in the late 30s and was successful.  See Fair Labor Standards Act.  0.25 dollars/hour in 1938 corresponds with approximately 4-5 dollars/hour in 2015.  So, no, minimum wage was NOT always engineered to be a living wage.  
Facts would help YOUR argument.
From FDR, on the minimum wage, in 1933:
“No business which depends for existence on paying less than living wages to its workers has any right to continue in this country… By living wages, I mean more than a bare subsistence level — I mean the wages of a decent living.”
You’re conflating the protracted fight Republicans waged against the minimum wage with its conception as a proper living wage.
Also, adjusting the minimum wage in 1938 fails to address the varying degrees of inflation for things like housing, health care, etc. So that’s just ridiculous. We’re also comparing federal to local, which is a little ridiculous—you can make the case that $11 per hour is enough to live on in Macon, Missouri.
But facts are inconvenient when we talk about living wages. I get it.
I hear ya man.  I agree with some of what you have to say.  I addressed some of those comments below in response to Naga.  This is a difficult issue to address – I shouldn’t pretend like I have all (or any?) of the answers :p  From a more liberal social perspective, I totally agree with what you have to say.  From a more conservative economic perspective, I don’t.
My argument is not entirely based on liberal idealism, it’s based on the fact that we end up paying for deficiencies in poverty-level wages anyway.
Children living in an unstable homes, with parents working multiple jobs, are most at-risk for incarceration. Average taxpayer cost for one prisoner in the state of California is $47,102 alone. Those who end up working minimum wage jobs will require a lot of financial assistance, and receive the largest federal subsidies on health care exchanges (or expanded Medicare). So again, tens of thousands of dollars in financial support. 
These people do not have the time, or money, to pursue the kind of education that can generate jobs (like tech start-ups) in today’s market. So that’s a net loss for national productivity, on paper.
And all we have to show for it is low-skill labor jobs dependent on government assistance that you end up paying for anyway. Does raising the minimum wage pass the cost on to the customer, or cut some jobs? Yes. But we are absorbing the cost anyway. Americans, typically, have a very difficult time understanding the long-term cost of things.
Does “forcing” an employer to pay an employee $50,000 seem unreasonable? Sure, in some places and some states. But Los Angeles is a unique beast; we cannot dance around the fact that the are not cheaper units for these people to move into. They don’t exist. The ones that do are getting razed for higher-priced housing. 
So you’re left with trying to lift workers out of poverty, with a combination of wage increases and aggressive housing policies, or an exodus of workers that feed, transport, provide care and perform menial tasks for high-skill labor workers. This is not San Francisco or New York, where mass transit is robust enough to allow low-skill labor workers to travel into expensive corridors for work. Our transit system is too spread out, too ineffective. They will just leave, become homeless, end up jail, etc.
You’re paying for it one way or another.
On the social liberal end, we often underrate the kind of work ethic these types of workers can bring to the market if we gave them the financial security to pursue more education. Abby Lopez has been on her own since she was 15-years-old. She has raised three kids, successfully. One is in college. Imagine if she had a MBA. She could probably run companies better than most. We are disregarding a huge pool of talent because we don’t want to DIRECTLY pay for their livelihood (but we do anyway, albeit indirectly).
PS.. just to clarify, I’m all for minimum wage being adjusted to compensate for inflation.
But to compensate for the standard of living locally or federally. That’s a huge difference. Los Angeles has the highest poverty rate in the nation and one of the lowest vacancy rates. It’s basically an income sinkhole for minimum wage workers.
I don’t buy this “not a living wage” and “transitional job” bunk because it’s bunk. Most people earning minimum wage are not teenagers, often in situations where upward mobility does not exist.
My grandfather never graduated from high school, and worked in a rock quarry. My grandmother never went to college, and worked in a munitions factory. Both earned enough to support four kids, buy a home, maintain two cars, etc. That was reality for Americans. Not this.
Even if Abby Lopez had a significant other earning the same amount, over 40 percent of their income would still be tied up in housing. That’s ridiculous. Any economist often says housing should be no more than 25 to 30 percent of your income. But Abby doesn’t even have the chance to lower that percentage without being HOMELESS.
Also, the whole concept of “living wage” is somewhat confusing to me.  Is a living wage the amount of money a person needs to live comfortably for his- or her- self?  Or does that include an entire family?  Should minimum wage be adjusted depending on the size of the family?  For example, taking LA alone into consideration… Abby Lopez says her rent is 1300/month.  For her rent to be 25 to 30 percent of her income, she’d have to make 50-63k per year!  So should minimum wage in LA be enough to support a 50-63k per year income?  What about the single 20 something year old living on his or her own?  Is the minimum wage the same for that person?  That person could feasibly live in LA, comfortably but not lavishly, on 700/month rent.  So should  minimum wage be only 25-30k for that person?  Either scenario is ridiculous.. it would be absurd, imo, to require that employers pay employees 50-65k per year at minimum (unless we’re going full communist).  It would be equally as absurd, imo, to have different minimum wage laws depending on the size of your family.
Naga.. established employers don’t determine wages based on resource availability. They don’t even determine wages based on the needs of the employee. Nor should they. Think of how silly the world would be if employers were required to pay employees whatever the employees deem is enough to maintain a healthy lifestyle. That’s absurd. Employers pay market value for the skills required by the job, or they suffer from (a) a noncompetitive work force, or (b) no work force at all. That’s capitalism for ya. It is not the employers fault that the market is saturated with unskilled or underskilled workers. A market saturated with unskilled or underskilled workers is not the employer’s responsibility.

And to confront the employer and record it in an attempt to strong arm him/her via humiliation is even more absurd.
Who is going to pay for the wage increases? You, the student, faculty and the employees of the universe ersion by the higher cost of attendance,  such as higher fees, increased cost of food, services, to name a few. Someone has to pay for this increase. Unlike what president Obama and the labor unions want you to,think, nothing is free. There is always a cost.
As the  rates for the labor union membership increase, so do their monthly dues.

A Disneyland-based measles outbreak that now counts nearly 70 cases in the western United States, plus one in Mexico, sheds light on a worrisome epidemic that has taken hold in some of the country’s most affluent communities. Symptoms of this condition include a rejection of peer-reviewed scientific literature and a propagation of sensational, unreliable information. Of further concern, a recent study published in the medical journal Pediatrics confirms the tendency of afflicted individuals to cluster geographically, endangering those yet unaffected. So far, logic and reason have proved insufficient in treating this pestilence. No, I’m not talking about airborne viruses. I’m talking about ignorance.

Anti-vaxxers, as they’ve become colloquially known, express distrust toward the effectiveness and safety of childhood vaccines, administered to safeguard children against illnesses such as measles, mumps, smallpox and whooping cough. While less than 2 percent of American parents opt out of the recommended vaccine schedule for children in kindergarten, this small but loud community of skeptics is having an adverse impact on the public at large. Their reticence to vaccinate presents a threat to everyone’s health and security.
Just look at the Disneyland cases. The majority of measles patients who contracted the disease at the park or from someone who recently visited, are people who’ve chosen to forgo the measles vaccine. Were he alive today, Charles Darwin might argue that their infection represents a form of natural selection against foolishness. Except that at least six of the infections reported from the outbreak are in people who have in fact received the measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine. Though the two recommended doses of MMR have been shown to be 99 percent effective against infection, some recipients — for reasons not quite understood by doctors — do not produce appropriate antibodies in response to vaccination. This is how the problem starts.
When a significant portion of a population is vaccinated against a disease, its collective immunity provides a degree of protection even for those who are vulnerable. Epidemiologists call this herd immunity. In an ideal world, the herd immunity sustained by universal vaccination would be sufficient in protecting those for whom the vaccine was ineffective. But as an increasing amount of parents join the anti-vaccine movement, the efficacy of the herd immunity is weakened. Anti-vaxxers cite the freedom of personal choice in defense of their actions — or, rather, inactions. As it turns out, personal choice is cause for public crisis.
Part of the problem has to do with the ease with which anti-vaxxers obtain exemption from state vaccination laws. A 2012 policy review published in the New England Journal of Medicine found that nine states expect only the signature of a parent to qualify an incoming kindergartner for personal-belief exemption from required vaccines. Twenty-one states, California included, require only a doctor’s signature. No explanation, no evidence of allergy or immune condition needed. This dubious policy exhibits neglect towards the relevant science and a lack of consideration towards public welfare.
The greatest frustration invoked by anti-vaxxers lies in the flawed nature of their claims. Many still derive conviction from a 1998 study that concluded a link between childhood vaccines and autism. The publication was retracted in 2010 after the methods and results of the study were found to be fraudulent. The researcher responsible had his license revoked that same year, and no causal relationship between vaccines and autism spectrum disorders has since been substantiated. Other concerns regarding the overload of infant immune systems, adverse neuropsychological outcomes, seizures and fevers all find contrary evidence in the data accrued by dozens of large-scale, long-term pediatric studies. Anecdotal evidence does not equate to empirical evidence.
Of course, it would be unwise to assume that the current body of findings closes the book on the great vaccine debate. It is of huge importance, a necessity even, that reputable agencies like the American Academy of Pediatrics and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention continue to monitor all available vaccines indefinitely. For now, however, the data point overwhelmingly to the success and reliability of vaccination towards disease prevention.
As for the vaccine against ignorance? Regrettably, the science is still out on that one.
Austin Reagan is a junior majoring in environmental studies and political science. His column, “The Scientific Method,” runs Mondays. 
70?! The average daily attendance is over 30,000. This is a story about a rounding error. 
to clarify, I do advocate to get all vaccinations, I have all vaccinations, and if I have children, I will definitely make sure they get all vaccinations.
I tend to think more about the unlikely possibility that the government requires less doses of vaccines because there are too many people getting vaccines already knowing that if more doses were required the percent would be much closer to 100% than it is now and if the disease were completely eradicated people would forget, so instead they require so few doses of the vaccine knowing that a percentage will not produce antibodies and if exposed will get sick any way and be shown to serve as periodic reminders of the need for vaccines. 
the main problem I have with this article, is that, by using such obviously faulty logic, that it is covertly trying to recruit more people into opting out of vaccines. (that is, if you tell someone you cannot have something, like the option of opting out of something, they will tend to want it even more, especially if you are so condescending to them by calling them ignorant, imagine if you were called ignorant because of your beliefs regarding religion).
the only reason for concern of a threat is if the 99% effectiveness of vaccines is misleading or inaccurate.
someone who is vaccinated and never contracts the disease is not a statistic which would show the effectiveness of a vaccine if that person never comes in contact with the disease since that person might not have developed the antibodies. 
on the other hand, if the 99% effectiveness is so certain, than there is clearly no threat whatsoever. so why why campaign to require vaccines?
recently the cdc has made a number of big PUBLIC admitted mishaps, this is not counting the other mishaps that they have kept secret, if any.
traveling be plane is statistically significantly safer than by car or boat, yet those who opt out of travelling by plane can be 100% certain in all cases that they won’t be harmed as a result of traveling by plane since they have opted out. so why campaign to take away the option to opt out of vaccines?
I just don’t understand what the cause is to harass, stigmatize, and segregate, those who opt out of vaccines, especially since they are logically no threat whatsoever to 99% of those who are vaccinated.
It just seems logically no different that religious persecution, which is an ignorance that is more dangerous than the imaginary one the article is complaining about.
In other words, the threat 1% who contract the disease after being vaccinated, (which might just be the result of poor quality control making the vaccines, or maybe the doctor or nurse made a 1 in 100 mistake in administering the virus, like mix-up, etc.), according to their vaccination records, which could be easily forged, is not what the article is about, if it was, then it would be talking about tests for virus immunity/antibodies rather than vaccinated records.
If there was no way to opt out of vaccines, or if those who opt out of vaccines are unreasonably stigmatized and harassed for non-existent threats even more than they are now for now, then, there might just be significantly more vaccination records forged, or worse, if there is a serious mishap in future new vaccines as there was for polio, like for instance Ebola, and EVERYONE is required to get the vaccine at the SAME TIME, then everyone might get infected and die.
that is, in point of fact, those 1% who are vaccinated but don’t produce antibodies are just as much, if not more, dangerous than those who opt out, but no one is talking about testing everybody for antibodies, and treating everyone who does not have antibodies equally, regardless of whether or not they were vaccinated.
but my point is that, no matter what, those people who do have antibodies, especially those who acquire antibodies from vaccinations, will never, under any circumstance, contract the disease, and are therefore not under any threat whatsoever.
but this does not preclude the possibility, no matter how slight, of someone being vaccinated to contract the disease, which is a very real possibility based on history, as well as the fact that doctors don’t know enough to know why 1% don’t develop antibodies.
it is like the problem the shortsighted economic models had that led to the 2008 financial crisis, they failed to take into account historic trends.
According to the logic used in the article, there is absolutely no threat whatsoever to 99% of those who are vaccinated since they will not, under any circumstance, ever contract the disease, and therefore no reason for any outrage or change in public policy including expulsion or segregation of those who choose not to be vaccinated remembering the mishap of the polio vaccine causing polio as well as the mishap with the latest seasonal flu vaccine.
LOL.  Typical propaganda.  I’m very well-informed about the alleged benefits of vaccinations.  It’s just that I simply reject the validity of the claims, taking into account vaccine contamination, failures, and profit motivation.  Time and time again “health care” products have proven to be money-making schemes, not solutions to illness.
It must really irk the needle-fanatics that most of us who won’t accept their opinions – yes, opinions – that vaccinations are “beneficial” are far from “ignorant” and “uneducated.”  The average vaccine truth individual has an earned Bachelor’s or Master’s, far from the portrayal of high school dropout losers afraid of “science.”  Plenty of doctors and nurses refuse to take the needle, as well.
Alleged?  Are you actually retarded?
No, I’m not retarded – I told you didn’t take the needle.
This article, and others like it, are missing one of the biggest reasons why people don’t get the measles shot.  It’s not that all these folks think vaccines are dangerous or not beneficial.  Rather it is a religious objection to the way the MMR vaccination was developed.  Do a Google search on “MMR cell line”, and find out where that cell line was derived from.  And then you’ll know why many pro-vaccine folks that get ALL the other vaccinations refrain from getting the MMR vaccine.  And BTW, there is no longer any alternative sold in the U.S.  All MMR vaccinations available here use that controversial cell line.  Until the FDA approves a non-controversial MMR vaccination like the one used in Japan, many people here will go without the MMR shot.
“religious objection?”  Ignorant, first -century bullshit.  I’ll take 21st century science every time.
I completely agree with science as it relates to vaccinations.  I believe just like you do, that vaccinations are a necessary part of disease prevention.  Perhaps you didn’t understand my post.
I do have science question for you.  The name of the cell line used in the U.S MMR vaccination uses the cell line called WI-38, which was developed around the middle of the last century.  Can you tell me from where the WI-38 was obtained?  Go ahead and give it a shot, science whiz.  We’re waiting to see if you get the answer right.
“the majority” of those affected were unvaccinated…but no one ever shows exact numbers, either side…so SOME of those affected WERE vaccinated…why don’t we hear more about THAT fact…
The CDC is not a reputable agency. It’s so easy to do a control study on unvaccinated kids versus vaccinated kids. The unvaccinated kids will be healthier. But why don’t they do these studies? Because the studies will show parents have been lied to about the safety of vaccination. Like antibiotics, vaccination is overused and misuse. BTW, I vaccinated my child years ago and so I’m not against vaccination. I’m against vaccines that don’t work but are forced on the public because Big Pharma makes $$. Read Suzanne Humphries’ book on vaccination.
Anti-science, anti-reality fools.  Period.
Many folks who refuse the MMR shot fully agree with the science behind vaccinations.  It’s the source of the cell line (WI-38) used in MMR that make many people refrain from getting that shot for religious and ethical reasons.  I know lots of people who would pay a lot of money to get their kids vaccinated for MMR if only they could get access to a version of the MMR shot that isn’t based on WI-38.  Unfortunately, that doesn’t exist in the U.S.
Also in the news right now is licensed medical doctor Jack Wolfson, who refuses to take the needle.  Epithets and buzzwords don’t create reality.
Ask yourself why so many “health care” institutions across America have trouble meeting their goal of 100% vaccination of their medical staff (e.g., MDs and RNs).  Sometimes it’s barely over 50%.  Are these folks ALL “ignorant” like you claim?  LOL.
You guys are fucking idiots, period.
No, I’m not interested in having sexual relations with you…as in, “f-ing idiots.”
If you’re knowledgeable about vaccinations, where did WI-38 come from?  (that’s the cell line used to develop the MMR vaccination).  I’m a pro-vaccination guy, but the answer to this question gives me some pause about the MMR vaccine.  Do you know the answer?
