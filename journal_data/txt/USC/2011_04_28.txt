The USC women’s tennis team is hoping to rebound from a precarious ending to its regular season as they travel to Ojai, Calif. for the Pac-10 championships, which begin Thursday.
USC coach Richard Gallien’s group struggled in Pac-10 play, finishing with a .500 record against conference foes. While USC (14-7, 4-4) took care of business against the lower half of the Pac-10, Oregon, Washington State), they had struggled against the more talented and deeper teams like Stanford and California.
Senior Maria Sanchez finished off the year with a strong outing against UCLA’s McCall Jones. And with her sights set on the looming NCAA tournament, Sanchez, the nation’s on-again, off-again No. 1 player, looks to be in good form heading into the Pac-10 championships. USC will need her at full strength if they hope to transform a up-and-down season into success at the Pac-10s this weekend.
Before moving onto NCAA championships coming in mid-May, Sanchez will face a few of her bitter rivals in the Pac-10 tourney this weekend in California’s Jana Juricova and Arizona State’s Kelcy McKenna. Juricova and McKenna account for two of Sanchez’s three singles losses this season.
But while Sanchez is at the top of her game, injuries could prove to be problematic.
“We are doing great as we try to get healthy,” Gallien said about his team’s progress. “Valeria [Pulido] is out and Danielle [Lao} is only good to play doubles, but Maria looks so strong and she and Kaitlyn [Christian} are a real threat to win the doubles [portion of the Pac-10 Championships].”
With sophomores Valeria Pulido and Danielle Lao sidelined, the challenge will be steep for the Women of Troy, as the the doubles’ duo of Sanchez and Christian has been strong throughout the year. Ranked No. 80 to begin the year, the Christian/Sanchez tandem has risen all the way to No. 5, finishing the regular season on a six-game winning streak and a 24-2 record.
For the freshman Christian the Pac-10 championships will be a good test to get acclimated to the intensity of the postseason, especially before she encounters the limelight of the NCAA tournament. With Lao out, Christian will have to take a bigger role than usual in taking hold of second singles, and if this season is any indication, the freshman is more than capable of handling the challenge.

After four years of planning, the Undergraduate Student Government is preparing to release its sustainable mug this fall.
The mug will be available at the bookstore and students will receive a discount on beverages purchased at USC Hospitality venues when they use it. Students will also be allowed to take beverages in the mug into libraries on campus next fall, according to USG.
Current plans will allow students with the mug to get discounts on coffee at Seeds, Trojan Grounds, Café 84, Tutor Hall Café, Popovich Café, Literatea, the Annenberg coffee cart, Shop Café and the Law School Café.
Elizabeth Trower, former USG senior director of communication, said the idea for a sustainability mug was first proposed in 2008.
“It’s a project that involved coordinating an incredible number of different interests on campus,” Trower said. “We had to get Hospitality on board, the bookstore to distribute and sell it and the libraries to okay the design of the mug.”
Tim Sae Koo, former USG’s university affairs director, said the project lacked administrative input last year, so the project had to begin again from scratch.
“I said I’m going to take care of this and make sure things follow through,” Sae Koo said. “It was one of my top goals because it’s a great program.”
USG said Hospitality plans to purchase the mug in early July so it can be made, shipped and sold during the fall semester.
Sae Koo said he hopes the mug project will finally be realized this fall.
“I am very hopeful that it will pull through and students will appreciate it and use it,” Sae Koo said. “The main goal is to reduce paper cups waste. Even if it’s small, it still makes a difference on the impact on sustainability.”
How sustainable is it that USC has to produce thousands of mugs, which probably will NOT be sold out, when everyone already had mugs to use. Will there be a discount for students who use their own non-USC mugs?
