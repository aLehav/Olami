While the spread of the coronavirus has many organizations canceling future programming and outreach events, USC’s GlamourGals, a group that provides older adults with manicures, transitioned to methods of remote volunteering. By creating handwritten letters, the organization continues to serve residents of senior homes in Los Angeles.
GlamourGals, a national organization of more than 100 high school and college chapters, provides a chance for older adults to interact with the younger generations. The USC chapter, headed by president Anjali Devgan, visits the Belmont Village Senior Living Community in Hollywood Hills monthly to offer manicures, nail painting, greeting cards and opportunities to chat. 
Carly Roman, a graduate student studying gerontology, founded the USC GlamourGals chapter in 2017 to confront senior loneliness and generate positive intergenerational conversations. While national quarantine measures limit the chapter’s volunteering options, the chapter can depend on written communication to keep in line with their mission.
The national foundation is developing a program, the #MyDearFriend campaign, for volunteers to write letters of encouragement to residents. The USC chapter volunteers are encouraged to send their letters to chapter leadership, who plan to forward them to Belmont Village, according to Roman. 
“Obviously, we can’t do the nail painting anymore, but the cards are always relevant, and they love, love seeing them,” said Devgan, a junior majoring in gerontology and health and human sciences.
Devgan said volunteers have sent about 30 to 40 letters through the #MyDearFriend campaign. The campaign allows more volunteers than usual to connect with residents during the social distancing period, with the chapter usually only traveling to Belmont Village with around 10 volunteers to avoid overburdening residents. 
The organization stresses the value of interacting with the older adult community, who tend to not be the most communicative, and who need more attention to combat loneliness while isolation measures continue, Devgan said. 
“That’s why we’re sort of trying to do letter writing, and whenever they see it, we know that it’ll brighten their days,” she said.
Following the spread of the virus and containment measures, the USC chapter has also transitioned to virtual volunteering methods to maintain contact with older adults.
According to Roman, the chapter is working alongside the Student Gerontology Association and older volunteers in the School of Gerontology to develop an intergenerational phone chain. The phone chain will incorporate a telecommunications method of contact between younger and older volunteers within the gerontology community at USC.
“So volunteers, in addition to doing these letters for the typical people we volunteer with, hopefully will get to sign up to make some calls to the volunteers through the [gerontology] school,” Roman said. 
The technological transitions allow the organization to expand communication opportunities for volunteers as well as refocus how they volunteer with others in the gerontology community, Roman said.  
Alyssa Caravas, a sophomore majoring in environmental studies, joined the chapter last fall to engage in positive conversations with the senior community and promote healthy relationships between older adults and students. Since joining, she’s visited Belmont Village eight times.
“I don’t paint nails, so I had to teach myself really well because I wanted to be able to do a good job for them,” Caravas said. “We didn’t have many [outreach] options like that back at home when I was in high school, so it’s really amazing to be involved and get to talk to them.”
The chapter had plans to develop relationships with other senior housing communities around campus but has since postponed establishing concrete plans until next semester, opting to maintain virtual contact with senior residents for the foreseeable future. Recently, West Bay Senior Living in Orange County reached out to the chapter to establish phone visits between GlamourGals volunteers and West Bay residents.
“There’s no bounds to getting people to communicate between generations, and I think that’s the crux of what GlamourGals does,” Roman said. “Let’s think about [aging], and let’s think about it more positively.”

When I packed up and went home for spring break, I mostly gathered my comfiest loungewear — big sweaters, worn-in T-shirts and ratty sweatpants. With my original Walt Disney World plans thwarted, I anticipated spending a week vegging out at home before returning to campus to resume life as normal. 
But, as I’m sure we’re all aware by now, things did not return to normal, nor will they for quite some time. As each day brought a new wave of sweeping changes, as USC shifted to exclusively online classes and postponed an in-person graduation, as cities tightened their travel restrictions and as nonessential businesses shut down, there were fewer and fewer reasons for me to go back. So I haven’t. 
Overall, I’m very lucky. I don’t have the virus and neither do any of my friends or family. Our secluded suburban neighborhood allows me to go for fortifying strolls whenever I want. Plus, my dad had the foresight to stock up with two big bags of King Arthur flour, so I can bake as much bread as my heart desires. As far as social distancing goes, my situation is about as good as it can get.  
Yet I can’t help but mourn my tiny USC apartment. My life would be indubitably worse if I were holed up there — at the very least, I would be subsisting on Bagel Bites and instant macaroni rather than home-cooked meals. But still, I miss it. I miss the wall outside my bedroom window that blots out the sunlight, the finicky gas stove that requires a match to light, the strangely sloped floor that causes my rolling chair to slide. But most of all, I miss my clothes. At this point, my apartment is just a glorified storage unit. 
In the past few weeks, my wardrobe has consisted only of the stuff I brought back with me for spring break. Sometimes I’ll put on old hoodies from high school declaring my membership in the school paper and Academic Decathlon. When I’m feeling really fancy, I might even borrow my mom’s silk pajama pants, paired with woolly socks and an oversized cardigan. 
To be honest, even if I did have my full wardrobe with me, I probably wouldn’t touch half of it. With nowhere to go and no one to impress, there’s simply no point. Why would I pour myself into skintight jeans just to sit at my desk for five hours straight?   
Before all this, getting up and getting dressed was the best part of my day. But I’m now realizing it’s not about the clothes themselves. It’s about the act of dressing up. I miss the task of perusing my closet and carefully curating an outfit based on the day’s agenda. I miss drawing on eyeliner and spritzing on perfume. I miss the feeling of having places to go and people to see. 
One of my favorite journalists, Rachel Syme of The New Yorker, started a hashtag on Twitter: #distancebutmakeitfashion. Every weekend, people post pictures of themselves sporting their Sunday best, for no reason other than to have a reason to dress up. So on Sunday, I got up at a normal hour. I washed my face and brushed my hair. I applied makeup, then put on my favorite overalls that I brought home with me but haven’t touched once.
And you know what? I felt better. More confident. More like myself, and less like a lazy oversized grub growing pale and plump in my moldy grotto.  
I’ll probably have to go back to my apartment soon just to start cleaning up and moving out. There’s no way I’m going to start wearing structured trousers every day, but I’ll be glad to bring back some clothes that can make these wild times seem a little more normal, a little more bearable. I hope you, too, have something that gives you that sense as well.

In an effort to alleviate stress during the coronavirus pandemic, the Local USC Moms and Dads On Call group has begun to distribute free bags of toilet paper, ramen noodles and other snacks to USC students living on or near campus.
According to Rory Bennett, the founder of the group, the initiative arose from students’ messages to her requesting assistance in supplying basic necessities during this period of quarantine. 
“[The delivery] began because we started hearing from students and checking in with students that were remaining in off-campus apartments mostly that ‘Hey, I’m kind of running low on toilet paper’ … and that the grocery shelves at Ralphs, Trader Joe’s and Target were hit-and-miss,” said Bennett, an alumna and parent of a USC student. 
Bennett began asking local parents to stockpile toilet paper and other relevant goods during their own shopping errands. 
Karni Block Syed, a parent of a USC student, donated toilet paper she had bought for an annual camping trip to be delivered to the Trojan community. 
“I donated just 39 rolls, but we’ve been able to accumulate, as a group, so many,” Syed said. “Tons and tons of students got donated toilet paper rolls, tons and tons. It’s unbelievable how the parents have come together and worked hard to make sure that the students had what they needed.”
Involvement grew as out-of-state parents donated money to replenish the supplies. Bennett made the initiative official by creating a flyer on Facebook and spreading the word to friends and families of students who need the support. 
“Even before we started just getting our little flyer out to some students we know that have helped us at events and our members of our groups, they got it out to their friends,” Bennett said. “The minute it went out on [March] 26 to friends, the [students] started texting ‘We need it, we need it.'”
The initiative began with local parents delivering the goods, but social distancing guidelines and the stay-at-home order required the group to change plans.
“We’re going to do whatever we can to get [the goods] to [the students],” Bennett said. “The students were texting their locations, and we were dropping off [bags]. [There] was such a strong need — I [received] like 200 texts, 200 locations.” 
To meet the demand, parents in the group brought bags to USC Village during specified time slots, and students who needed the supplies picked them up. 
Last week, the group changed the way it distributes the bags in response to social distancing. All the donations are sent to a local USC family’s home, where students can visit to pick up the items. The bags can also be dropped off at students’ residences if necessary. 
“Having this local family, the Olmedos, volunteer to be available as a location for students to pick up — or, if you need to stay isolated or if you don’t have a car, for them to drop off — that’s really been a great solution,” Bennett said.
Victoria Mulligan, an alumna and parent of a USC student, was involved with the group before the coronavirus crisis, driving students to the airport during breaks and gathering supplies for students’ 21st birthday celebrations. Now, Mulligan opened her doors to collect toilet paper donations from members in the Facebook group.
“I have a couple of shipments that out-of-state parents have sent me of toilet paper,” Mulligan said. “They came in yesterday, so I’ll drop that off to the family … and they’ll bag everything up.”
The Local USC Moms and Dads On Call group has delivered almost 200 bags to USC students. 
Alexis Nixon, a graduate student studying music industry, is one of those students.
“I was able to just drive to the Village and meet them to pick [the bag] up — it was really awesome,” Nixon said. “They give you toilet paper, snacks and a few nonperishable food items … I guess the best thing is that it has nothing to do with the school itself. It’s just moms that live close wanting to help out.”
Nixon said that thanks to the initiative, she no longer needs to get up early in the morning to search grocery stores for basic necessities.
The initiative is one of several projects the Local USC Moms and Dads On Call group has piloted, including giving out snacks at the main campus walking entrance and bringing therapy dogs and ponies to campus. The group, founded in November, now has more than 3,200 members and aims to ensure that nonlocal students have what they need.
“It’s just a wonderful group of people — there are no egos involved,” Mulligan said. “It’s just parents trying to help kids who don’t have their parents close by. I think we all feel that if the situation were reversed, any parent would do the same for our kids.”

On Instagram, the camera eats first — but should we really be giving an app so much control over our dietary choices?
Diet fads are timeless. The ’80s had SlimFast, the ’90s had Atkins and the 2000s regrettably popularized juice cleanses, but Instagram has elevated diet culture to a whole new level, disguising harmful habits in pretty packaging.
A 2016 study by the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine found that participants who spent the most time on social media were 2.2 times more likely to report issues with body image and eating, and Instagram is particularly nefarious. A systematic review also from 2016 in the journal Body Image found photo-based activities especially trigger negative thoughts about one’s body. 
Author and registered dietitian Christy Harrison defines diet culture as a system of beliefs that equates being thin with health and moral virtue, promotes weight loss to achieve status, demonizes certain ways of eating and oppresses people who do not fit within this false paradigm of health.
Diet culture is an aesthetic currency on Instagram. Even content that does not specifically involve food, health or fitness still often upholds the tenets of diet culture. Filters, angles, captions and comments all merge together to remind users of a narrow and falsely entangled conception of beauty and health.
It’s easy to criticize multimillionaire Kim Kardashian West when a $200,000 check can buy a post from her to sell her young fans ineffective detox tea. The trifecta of Kardashian West’s seemingly needless pursuit of further wealth, the useless product and the unrealistic emphasis on a flat stomach come together to form the perfect loathsome narrative, but examples of diet culture root themselves far deeper into our timelines.
Recent diet trends such as Paleo, Whole30 and clean eating have moved away from explicit goals of weight loss to instead focus on vague values of wellness. Of course, when our cultural ideal of wellness equals thinness, such rebranding is meaningless and certainly still harmful.
Body positivity trends and greater cultural awareness regarding the dangers of media representations have made explicit weight shaming more taboo. Target’s advertisements now feature women of multiple sizes, and it’s hard to imagine a show like NBC’s 2004-16 series “The Biggest Loser” being greenlit by network executives in 2020. However, by transforming external concerns about weight and physical appearance into shallow concerns over health and wellness, we’ve further internalized diet culture’s toxic lessons.
Users might follow an Instagram food influencer like Ella Mills in the hope of integrating some of her vegan recipes into their weekly meal rotation. I’m sure that Mills’ 1.7 million followers and indeed Mills herself have the best of objectives, but even well-intentioned food content can promote diet culture’s harmful ideas by transforming wellness into an aesthetic sensibility.
Food-centric influencers are never just about the recipes that they post. More often than not, there is a certain well-lit, pastel aesthetic that sells these influencers as aspirational figures. What bloggers like Mills sell — whether they are aware or not — is a lifestyle. 
Suddenly, food becomes so much more. With the right recipe and the right lighting, maybe we too can have a happy baby and tiled kitchen. By disguising Mills’ vegan diet behind this wholesome facade, Instagram depicts diet culture as a false sense of security that could conceal signs of disordered eating.
Disordered eating is an umbrella term that covers familiar eating disorders such as anorexia and bulimia as well as the 5-20% of people who struggle without meeting the full criteria for an eating disorder. While people who suffer from disordered eating may not meet all the clinical criteria, they nevertheless experience significant stress that diminishes their health and quality of life.
Physically, disordered eating can cause issues such as weight fluctuations, fatigue, menstrual irregularity and cavities. Emotionally, people become preoccupied with weight, food, diet and body image. They might begin restricting whole categories of food, obsessively counting their calories or performing specific food rituals. 
Followers of influencers like Mills might begin to feel intense guilt when they don’t have the time or resources to fulfill her wholesome aesthetic. They might begin to identify certain foods as good because of how influencers represent them as “clean” or “whole” and subsequently regard other foods as bad, creating a punishing black and white paradigm of nutrition. 
When it comes to disordered eating, early intervention is associated with the best outcomes. After disordered eating becomes a daily habit, it becomes harder to address, and patients may be unaware of the problems it causes. By selling disordered eating as an aspirational lifestyle, Instagram might prevent such important early intervention and further entrench these harmful and misguided health values.
It’s impossible to avoid diet culture. What’s necessary is awareness. The next time you log onto Instagram, pay attention to how food is portrayed within your social media sphere and how that makes you feel. Watch for signs of disordered eating in friends, family and yourself.
Our current diet trends will go out of style one day, but self-love and compassion are timeless. If the camera must eat first, then make sure you’re also feeding your soul.

Earlier in the semester, the School of Cinematic Arts quickly responded to a controversial revision to its attendance policy within the John Wells Division of Writing for Screen and Television that would not distinguish between excused and unexcused absences, with each absence after the first two decreasing a student’s grade by 10%. The department later clarified the policy to allow for some exceptions, such as family emergencies, health issues or otherwise. 
When the coronavirus pandemic began to unravel in late February, Provost Charles Zukoski clarified that notes from medical providers were not required for students requesting absences during that period of time. Days later, the Instagram page “Overheard University” published an alleged quote from a USC professor that said, “Only documented medical illnesses count for absences. I hear people are worried about the coronavirus and I don’t care. The only reason I want to hear for why you can’t come to class to turn in your paper on Thursday is that you were hit by a bus while reading about the virus spreading.” 
Regardless of whether this professor was serious, in light of complaints toward SCA’s revisions of its attendance policy, discussions surrounding the coronavirus pandemic and absences, it is imperative that the University not only revisit its absence policy guidelines for upcoming semesters but also consider centralizing and clarifying its current policies.
The only efforts of centralization are a brief mention in the Dornsife Teaching Assistant Handbook that encourages professors to remind students of the importance of regular attendance. Furthermore, Student Health has a page clarifying that it does not provide written medical excuses for short-term absences.
Students’ physical and mental health can be prioritized by offering clear guidelines to faculty, which may help remove barriers for students who are struggling with their health. 
This is not an opportunity for the University to create lasting change in modern education but an opportunity to catch up to many of its other peers and maintain inclusivity at the forefront of student consideration.
Many other universities, such as the University of Massachusetts Amherst, Monmouth College, UCLA and Stanford University maintain centralized web pages regarding class attendance and absence policies. 
Monmouth College in Illinois divides absences into approved, excused and unexcused absences and offers faculty members the opportunity to set their own standards. UCLA allows professors to establish attendance as an academic requirement and Stanford encourages students to contact their faculty to resolve attendance issues. 
Although these attendance policies are not particularly far-reaching, they are still centralized and clear for both students and instructors. Attendance accommodations, according to Stanford, “provide students the flexibility to address life circumstances while maintaining a responsible approach to their academic responsibilities.” 
The way these policies are put forward is also important, as Stanford’s messaging demonstrates a commitment to the well-being of students along with inclusivity and openness.
SCA’s screenwriting division clarifies its formerly controversial policy to include absence exceptions for religious holidays and DSP accommodations, while also clarifying that students can get instructor approval for some accommodations.
Students should still be expected to personally inform professors or teaching assistants as soon as they can if they expect to miss a class. Most professors and teaching assistants are completely understanding of students’ needs. Oftentimes all it takes is an email to sort out an issue of attendance, but regardless, the University must create a clear, centralized and standardized attendance policy that is inclusive of physical health, mental health, religious holidays and other extenuating non-academic circumstances.
During this outbreak, it is important that USC consider well-being and inclusivity. This clarification and opportunity is the messaging that must be put forth by the University and allow USC to take on a vision of solidarity.

Following last year’s release of singles “In My Room” and “DHL,” Frank Ocean returns with another taste from his rumored upcoming project. Frank has utilized pictures and symbols as a means of representing each song, with the first two shown in last year’s drops.
The two singles, which dropped late last year on streaming platforms, started this trend, featuring the same 17 silhouettes on the bottom of the singles’ covers accompanied by an actual picture from which the silhouettes seemed to be based.  
His latest, “Dear April” and “Cayendo,” which dropped Friday, fit into this mold by each featuring a new symbol stemming from the original 17. Yet, Frank chooses to leave out the actual photographs, likely due to the fact that these tracks are labeled “acoustic” and are not the final mixes for the upcoming album. 
A remix of “Cayendo” was previously teased around the same time as “DHL” on Frank’s Apple Music radio station, “blonded”, in October of last year. This Sango remix of the song carries more energy since it was flipped for the club scene, specifically Frank’s PrEP+ nightlife events in New York City. 
The new acoustic version falls in line with a more familiar sound from Frank, one that can be more associated with his 2016 record “Blonde.” It is slow and dreamy with Frank’s lyrics interchanging between Spanish and English. “Cayendo” is a stripped-down track, featuring what only sounds like a guitar and Frank’s vocals working together to create sounds that echo endlessly. 
Keeping in tune with the “Blonde” era aesthetic, “Cayendo” is very intimate and its lack of much instrumentation allows his voice to be the focal point of the track. In tandem with the washed guitar, the two create a state of isolation fitting for how many of us may be feeling in these times. 
The lyrics of “Cayendo” demonstrate how Frank has accepted an unfavorable truth about someone yet he still feels like he is falling for them. They’re succinct yet paint a bigger picture of the power of love and how strong it can be, especially when not reciprocated. Although his earlier singles were rhythmic and structured, “Cayendo” does an impressive job of tapping into simplistic, emotional storytelling.
His second single which dropped over the weekend, “Dear April,” also carries this “acoustic” label on it yet isn’t as stripped down as “Cayendo.” The same washed, dreamy guitar carries the instrumental with additional keys and synths backing it up. “Dear April” is also reminiscent of the “Blonde” era for Frank, which is interesting to note given how different the singles from last year were. While this almost signature ambient soundscape exists in all four singles, the difference in the rhythm of the tracks could suggest a past and present contrast similar to how “Blonde” is presented as two halves — with the split coming in on the beat switch for the song “Nights.” 
“Dear April” is a melancholy track with another undemanding yet effective instrumental flowing underneath Frank’s voice. The theme of love is still present; he sings of a relationship that has ended but mentally lingers. It reminds of a lyric from Frank’s song “Ivy,” in which he sings, “We’ll never be those kids again,” signifying his acceptance of reality. The line “What we had won’t be the same thing now” from the new single resonates with this theme and potentially for this “side” of the album if the duality motif from “Blonde” continues.
Both tracks are reminders of how simplistic Frank’s artistry can be while still delivering great depth through lyrics and production. It’s exciting to see where the rest of this new record will lead, especially since the non-acoustic versions of these new singles are yet to be heard. 
Frank has kept fans somewhat in the dark with very little music coming after “Blonde,” similar to his behavior post-“Channel Orange,” with only a handful of singles like “Chanel,” “Biking” and “Lens” dropping in 2017. 
With “DHL,” “In My Room,” “Cayendo” and “Dear April,” along with the vinyls he has been selling on his website, we can assume more Frank Ocean music is imminent. But that also means another possible period of disappearance could follow after…

For those of you who haven’t read the “Harry Potter” books — and I can’t even believe that there are people who haven’t — now is the perfect time for you to immerse yourself in the wizarding world. 
Harry Potter At Home is here to help. A new hub within the main Wizarding World website, Harry Potter At Home provides quizzes, articles and crafting activities that allow novice and veteran readers to explore Harry’s world in a new way.
Although the website is geared toward children, the simplicity of the content allows “Harry Potter” to be accessible to people of all ages. Harry Potter At Home has a number of informational articles for first-time readers. They are introduced to 10 essential words to know when reading the books, including “muggle” and “Quidditch.” Another article introduces readers to the series’ three protagonists: Harry, Ron and Hermione. 
The website also provides quizzes on the first book, the game of Quidditch and professors at Hogwarts. Rest assured, these quizzes are much easier than the ones in your business class.
Of course, no “Harry Potter” website would be complete without a Sorting Hat quiz, which reveals the Hogwarts House you’d be sorted into based on your personality. The quiz itself offers thorough and thought-provoking questions in order to get to the core of your personality. To take the quiz, create a Pottermore account. With it, you’ll have access to even more “Harry Potter”-related activities such as discovering your wand and your Patronus.
Beyond articles and quizzes, the hub provides arts and crafts activities related to the books, which new and old readers are guaranteed to enjoy. Channel your inner Molly Weasley and knit your own Weasley scarf or create your own Marauder’s Map in the likes of its creators, Moony, Wormtail, Padfoot and Prongs, with easy-to-follow instructional videos. There’s also a number of mind-stimulating puzzles available, ranging from a Wizarding World crossword to a Triwizard Tournament Word Search. 
Outside of the website, Audible is giving out a free audiobook version of “Harry Potter and the Sorcerer’s Stone” narrated by Stephen Fry, who the website confirms “does an excellent Dumbledore.” In addition, all eight “Harry Potter” movies are available to watch on Syfy and USA Network’s official websites. You can also tune in to the “Harry Potter Book Club” podcast on Apple Podcasts, where you’ll listen to six friends’ journey through the books together and discuss the “literary, philosophical, religious, and socio-cultural dimensions of J. K. Rowling’s modern classic.” 
“Harry Potter” gives people of all ages, new readers and old, a little extra magic in their lives during this quarantine season.
