Horror is cinema’s most enthralling and frustrating genre. At their best, horror films can provide an adrenaline rush far more potent than any drug, energy drink or roller coaster. At their worst, they’re boring, contemptuously engineered claptrap dedicated to wasting time on the audience’s dime.

The finest examples of the craft — The Exorcist, The Shining and Rosemary’s Baby all spring to mind like zombie hands jutting out of freshly dug graves — lay siege to our comfort zones, shatter our nerves and allow us a simulation of mortal peril without consequence. By projecting our individual and communal fears onto a larger-than-life screen, these feelings are simultaneously elevated and externalized as psychological detritus is transformed into a benign state of voyeuristic make-believe. And let’s not forget, whether we’re laughing in a crowded theater with our friends or cowering alone on the couch, it’s fun to be scared!
Stephen King, a universally acknowledged master of the morbid, gave horror the closest thing it will ever receive to a mission statement when he wrote the following in his non-fiction book Danse Macabre, a genre survey that traced the history of horror from Victorian England to the present day: “I recognize terror as the finest emotion and so I will try to terrorize the reader. But if I find that I cannot terrify, I will try to horrify, and if I find that I cannot horrify, I’ll go for the gross-out.” Terror, of course, is the feeling of dread and anticipation that precedes a horrifying experience, and offers a lingering sensation of fear and pulse-pounding euphoria when properly realized. Unfortunately for today’s audiences, the majority of modern horror movies no longer possess the ability to truly terrify.
It’s time to scream and shout and let it all out: today’s horror films are drowning in formulaic storytelling and a fatal over-reliance on cheap jump scares (all cats and bathroom mirrors should be banned forthwith). Recent films such as Annabelle, The Purge: Anarchy  and The Quiet Ones may shock and startle us in the moment (your own mileage will vary), but any impact they have tends to evaporate the moment the lights come up. A good scary movie should stick with us, settle into our bones and take up permanent residence in our nightmares. James Wan’s The Conjuring, which benefitted from moody period aesthetics and a top-shelf cast including Patrick Wilson and Vera Farmiga, was probably the last mainstream horror movie to achieve that feat, but that film was the exception that proves the rule.
Early cinema, constrained by the threat of censorship (which was carried out at the state level before the establishment of the Production Code in the 1930s) and limited special effects budgets, often fed on both the terror and horror of the implicit. In Edgar G. Ulmer’s supremely underrated 1934 pre-code chiller The Black Cat, the audience never actually sees the avenging Dr. Werdegast (Bela Lugosi in his best non-Dracula role) flay the flesh from the bones of his former tormenter, the Satanic priest Poelzig (Boris Karloff), merely the sound of the latter’s anguished cries and a few shadowy images thrown on a wall. By leaving the very worst up to our imagination, the film’s notorious skinning scene is infinitely more effective than anything in the so-called “torture porn” subgenre — including the once-interminable Saw and Hostel franchises — which thankfully appears to have fallen out of favor in recent years.
Jack Clayton’s 1961 gothic horror film The Innocents, based on the novella The Turn of the Screw by Henry James and a script co-written by Truman Capote and William Archibald, is rightly considered one of the most effective haunted house movies of all time because it relies almost entirely on atmosphere and implication to tell its creepy tale of a sexually repressed governess (Deborah Kerr) who begins to suspect her two precocious charges are possessed by the restless spirits of the estate’s recently deceased valet and his lover. Compare that to the harmless spook-house jolts of the Insidious films and the tiresome shaky-cam antics of the Paranormal Activity series and its legion of imitators.
So, aside from the obvious (cut down on the remakes, hire better talent) what can be done to make modern movies frightening again? The injection of fresh blood has worked wonders in the past. Talented directors such as Francis Ford Coppola and James Cameron have used horror films as a means of breaking into the business because they’re relatively inexpensive to produce and don’t require movie stars to earn the attention of viewers.
A little more diversity wouldn’t hurt either. Today’s horror filmmakers, like the rest of their industry counterparts, are predominantly white males. The female perspective isn’t given a voice very often in this genre, but there have been a few notable exceptions. Director Mary Lambert scared audiences out of their wits with her 1989 adaptation of King’s Pet Sematary, while filmmaker Mary Harron reclaimed Bret Easton Ellis’s yuppie satire American Psycho as a biting commentary on misogyny taken to murderous extremes.
It’s also worth noting that the scariest movie of the year so far was written and directed by a woman. The Babadook, the feature-length debut of Australian auteur Jennifer Kent, revolves around Amelia (the sublime Essie Davis), a widowed single mother trying to save her mentally ill son Samuel (Noah Wiseman) from an implacable supernatural force that manifests in the pages of a seemingly innocuous children’s book.
What follows is a powerful synthesis of horror and genuinely moving drama that serves as a monstrous testament to the limits of maternal love in the face of overwhelming grief and resentment. Kent’s film, currently available on VOD, both reinvigorates and subverts some of the genre’s oldest tropes, creating something that feels at once original, primal and truly, utterly terrifying.
So if you want proof that real horror isn’t dead, look no further than The Babadook. Just be warned: Like the hitchhiking ghosts in Disney’s Haunted Mansion ride, this is the kind of movie that follows you home.

This Halloween weekend, enter “the sinister world of Escape” decked out in costume at Escape: All Hallows’ Eve in San Bernardino, California. Headliners include Afrojack, Tiësto and Dash Berlin, and joining these giants of electronic dance music is one act from USC’s own student body: Louis Vivet.

Nick DiPietrantonio and Aria Soroudi comprise this D.J./producer duo named Louis Vivet. Louis Vivet recently won Insomniac Festivals’ competition, Insomniac Discovery Project, which landed them a spot on the Escape stage this coming Halloween weekend. Soroudi is a USC alumnus currently attending Loyola Law School, and DiPietrantonio is a junior graphic design major at USC.
Winning the competition as full-time students is an impressive feat. “The Insomniac Discovery Project has around 500 entrants, and they pick around just a few candidates. And they judge based on your song and the mix you submit,” Soroudi said.
Louis Vivet’s SoundCloud has one 32-minute-long mix, “Fall 2014 Mix (Discover Set).” Their musical style is not typical of other E.D.M. D.J.s, and with more than  1,600 SoundCloud followers, the response has been positive.
Their song mixes a wide variety of treble melody, instead of an overbearing bass line. The musicality of the song incorporates synths, drums, voice and a variety of interesting instruments in an innovative way that is not common in the rave scene. It’s an inventive mix that that quickly inspires movement, singing and dancing in its listeners.
“When we first started, we were just focusing on making music that would appease the masses — like the whole E.D.M. crowd — and we kind of realized that that is not the sound or the vibe we were going for,” Soroudi said.
The duo defines their style as distinct. “We both have pretty specific taste in music. Once we narrowed down what we liked — as far as production goes and what type of dance music we liked — that helped us to hone in on what we wanted to play and what we wanted to make,” Soroudi said.
The two students met because they were members of the same fraternity at USC. They discovered that they both enjoyed the same music and eventually decided to collaborate to make their own.
“We started about two years ago. Soroudi was just deejaying a bunch, and I was producing,” DiPietrantonio said, “And we found out we liked the same music, and we just started kicking it in the studio and jamming together. And we started making some really cool stuff that no one had really heard before, so why not start a group?”
This pair’s chosen name also speaks to the uniqueness of their collaboration. Louis Vivet comes from a well-documented medical case from the late 19th century.
“Our name comes from the first medically recorded case of dissociative identity disorder, Louis Vivet. The two of us have very different personalities -—– one of us an engineer and a law student, and the other is a visual artist. We wanted to find a name that would play into those differences because we never want to allow just one state of mind to constrain our creativity. His story was the perfect way to tie the two of us together,” Soroudi said.
Soroudi and DiPietrantonio have also found ways to apply their academics to their blossoming music career. DiPietrantonio’s graphic design skills have especially contributed to Louis Vivet’s rise.
“It has helped us to develop an understanding of what we want our group’s digitals to look like. Being familiar to graphic design has really helped us create our brand and what we exactly want it to look like and how we want the visuals to accompany our sound,” DiPietrantonio said.
Louis Vivet has a song debuting two weeks after Escape, with an upcoming EP release afterwards. “Listening to our music is like diving into crystal clear waters at sunset off a really nice yacht, off the island of Capri,” DiPietrantonio said.
Louis Vivet is excited for a big turnout this weekend, especially from USC. “We’re just really excited to be playing at Escape, and we hope that everyone at USC can come out and celebrate with us and enjoy some rocking dance music.”

A grisly murder, a false accusation and a protagonist who wakes up one morning to find there are horns growing out of his head. This is the premise behind Alexandre Aja’s newest movie, Horns, based on the novel of the same name penned by Joe Hill. After premiering at the 2013 Toronto International Film Festival to mixed reviews, the film is set for general release this Halloween. This is perhaps the perfect release date for the gothic drama, which features not only a man who grows horns with supernatural powers, but also vicious snake attacks and the murder and rape of a beautiful young woman in the woods. Though the original novel was a major success, the film does not quite live up to its literary counterpart, with Daniel Radcliffe’s performance, as well as the script and direction, falling short.
The main problem with the film is that it can’t decide what it wants to be. It certainly contains enough bloodshed and physical calamity to be considered horror. Yet, it also contains a few scattered comical moments — or at least the way in which Radcliffe’s horns cause people to reveal their most immodest desires is certainly intended to be humorous. In addition, the moment when Radcliffe sprouts wings and flies into the air during the climactic fight scene is so ridiculous it is unclear whether it is supposed to be taken seriously. The comic elements, however, are inconsistent and not funny enough to put this film into the genre of dark comedy. There is also romance, drama and tragedy; however, the issue is that Horns neither picks one of these genres to occupy entirely, nor does it blend together the mesh of genres it attempts seamlessly. This leaves the audience uncertain as to what the film’s intentions really are.
The film focuses on Ig Perrish, a radio D.J. in a small town played by Harry Potter alum Radcliffe. Ig’s longtime girlfriend Merrin (Juno Temple) is found raped and murdered, and Ig is the prime suspect. Suddenly he finds himself a pariah among his closest friends and family, none of whom believe he is innocent. Then one morning, Perrish discovers that a pair of horns, which seem to imbue him with paranormal abilities, has sprouted from his head overnight. Whomever he crosses paths with suddenly receives the urge to expose their deepest secrets; this includes a mother confessing intimate details of her affair with her golf trainer (all in front of her young daughter), a doctor and nurse having sex in a chair mid-surgery and even Ig’s own parents confessing their resentment and dislike of their son.
Some of the aspects intended to be comical here simply end up appearing lewd and awkward, not helped by some rather wooden supporting performances. Ig decides to use his newfound powers to discover Merrin’s true killer, and during the process he finds himself being followed by an adoring group of snakes, willing to obey his every command. No need to read too deeply into the religious parallels here; Radcliffe is indeed becoming Satan himself, complete with red skin.
Flashback sequences reveal clues to the identity of the true perpetrator in Merrin’s murder, while the present-day scenes take the audience through a series of very dark and surprising events. As Ig becomes steadily more desperate, his behavior becomes more ruthless, driven by the continued cruelty of those around him. The humanity behind this devilish character is clearly taken rather heavily from Paradise Lost, made clear by references to John Milton’s text throughout the film. In addition, some of the concluding scenes are openly inspired by Dante’s Divine Comedy, further adding to the questions of religion and judgment in the plot.
Though a stronger lead performance probably couldn’t have saved this movie, it certainly would have helped. Radcliffe is not terrible, but he isn’t very impressive either. The complexity of emotion required by the role is significant, and in some of the more intensely emotional sequences, Radcliffe doesn’t quite manage to convince the audience of Ig’s plight.
The message of the movie is unclear. The powers of the horns suggest that below the façade everyone presents, people are controlled by their carnal desires: truly thinking of little more than sex, violence and gluttony. This rather bleak outlook on the human condition is paired with the suggestion that society is always ready to jump to conclusions and outcast our own without a second thought.
Still, no one could accuse this film of being unoriginal. The complex plot and various twists are executed well, and the action is complemented with notable characterization and psychological exploration. Though it is unlikely to break any records, it certainly brings up some interesting questions about religion and human nature. In the end, though, Horns tries too hard to be both astute and widely appealing, to combine a plethora of ideas while attempting to both shock and excite its audience. Sadly, it does not fully manage any of those feats.

A group of students is taking initiative to revamp the videos shown at international student orientation in an effort to make the videos more applicable to the students who attend.
The previous “Living in the United States” video series used to be mandatory for all international students and their families to watch at international student orientation.
“[The series] kind of made us feel like we were aliens just coming to Earth for the first time,” said Gabe Rocha, a junior from Brazil majoring in biomedical engineering.
After three years at USC, Rocha still remembered the video and decided to start a Change.org petition with his friends about removing the videos. On the petition site, the featured video begins with, “One of the things you might be thinking when you come to the U.S. is ‘how will I make “American Friends?’” The video begins first by explaining that Americans are very open to meeting new people. Then it goes through some non-verbal greetings that Americans use: the “handshake,” the “wave,” the “nod” and the “Fight On.”
The video also tells students, “If someone asks you how you are doing and keeps walking before you have a chance to answer, understand that it was only a greeting.”
Though USC often publicizes its large population of international students as a means of attracting prospective students, many students felt put off by the patronizing videos.
Tiffany Tse, a junior majoring in health promotion and disease prevention who is from Thailand, remarked that she and her friends wondered if Americans really thought international students were that “stupid.”
Over the summer, Undergraduate Student Government Vice President Rini Sampath noticed students were posting about Rocha’s petition on Facebook, and she decided to reach out to Rocha’s group.
After viewing the video, she deemed it offensive as well.
“It kind of just generalizes international students. It makes them all seem as if they have no idea of what American culture is like, whereas a significant portion of them are very fluent English speakers … They all got into USC for very good reasons,” Sampath said.
Last year’s International Student Assembly director had successfully petitioned to have the video removed from orientation. Current Executive Director Rachel Zou, however, said that the videos are still online and used as reference material, which is unfortunate because it reinforces stereotypes about international students that are already hard to shake.
“I think that some students just think that international students clump together, and stick more to each other. That’s true for all other communities here on campus,” she said. “Like you see other communities sticking to themselves more just because it’s more comfortable.”
Eventually the administration responded, and Rocha’s group, USG, Andy Su and Pablo Pozas Guerra of Diversity Affairs and ISA got involved in initial talks about the video. The group made the decision to revamp the video with new content that is more applicable to the USC experience. They’re currently trying to get the production aspects together.
“The goal is to create something that students connect to — the current video is very unreal,” Zou said. “It looks staged, it looks fake.”
ISA’s part will focus on research about what students want to see, and how that information should be presented. Zou said that some things that might be more helpful for an international student who just landed in Los Angeles for the first time would give advice about LAX and Los Angeles in general. ISA is also planning events that help to bridge the gap, such as “Around the World in 7 Days,” a series of events that will showcase different cultures.
“At times we don’t do the very best job of integrating those students into our community,” Sampath said. “So until we get to that point where we see international students actively mingling with our student body, it’s going to be hard to break down those stereotypes of the international student community.”
USG will be trying other activism and initiatives such as more discussions and increased marketing to the international community, as well as play a greater role in promoting events such as the annual Night Market hosted by Asian Pacific American Student Assembly.
“I think it is the personal responsibility of every student on this campus to make sure that all students feel comfortable, safe and respected,” Sampath said.
 
Nice article. Being  an international student isn’t easy, given our complex culture and language. Assistance must come from numerous sources, including videos like this, to aid these young people embarking on life’s journey. A new award-winning worldwide book/ebook that can help anyone coming to the US is “What Foreigners
Need To Know About America From A To Z: How to Understand Crazy American
Culture, People, Government, Business, Language and More.” It is used in foreign Fulbright student programs and endorsed worldwide by ambassadors, educators, and editors. It also identifies “foreigners” who became successful in the US and how they contributed to our society, including students.
   A chapter on education explains how to be accepted to an American university and cope with a new culture, friendship process and classroom differences. Some stay after graduation. It has chapters that explain how US businesses operate and how to get a job (which differs from most countries), a must for those who want to work for an American firm here or overseas.
   It also has chapters that identify the most common English grammar and speech problems foreigners have and tips for easily overcoming them, the number one stumbling block they say they have to succeeding here.
   Most struggle in their efforts and need guidance from schools’ international departments, immigration protection, host families, concerned neighbors and fellow
students, and books like this to extend a cultural helping hand so we all have a win-win situation.  Good luck to all wherever you study!

Investigative journalist Charles Lewis spoke to a crowd of students and faculty on Thursday afternoon at the Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism’s Dean’s Open Forum.
White lies · Investigative journalist Charles Lewis (above) speaks at the “Investigating Power and the Future of Truth” forum on Thursday. – Christine Yoo | Daily Trojan
The forum, “Investigating Power and the Future of Truth,” was co-sponsored by both the Annenberg  School and the Norman Lear Center.
In his talk, Lewis emphasized the misinformation that occurs in government, private corporations and the media. He spent much of the discussion highlighting the most egregious examples of misinformation in each of these categories.
Lewis, a professor at American University and the founder of the Center for Public Integrity, selected his examples from the comprehensive investigation into misinformation in America he conducted for his new book, 935 Lies: The Future of Truth and the Decline of America’s Moral Integrity. For Lewis, who was named by the Encyclopedia of Journalism as one of the 30 most notable investigative reporters in the United States since World War I, the lies are perpetuated by not just government, but corporations and the media as well.
Lewis discussed the United States’ bleak governmental history of lying to the American public about the reasons for international military intervention and war from World War II to Vietnam to Iraq.
“I noticed that 60 percent of the American people believed that there were weapons of mass destruction [in Iraq] about a year after Bush said they weren’t there,” Lewis said. “That was alarming, actually.”
That realization provided Lewis the impetus for a never before undertaken project. After two and a half years of research, Lewis and the team at the Center for Public Integrity had compiled 380,000 words in transcripts from the top eight U.S. officials on the status of WMD presence in Iraq.
“I felt compelled to identify the statements that had been made, precisely,” Lewis said.
Released five years after the Iraq invasion, the database was covered by major news outlets and represented the effort to change the opinion of the 60 percent of Americans who still believed Bush’s previous claims were factual, despite the fact that Bush had already admitted he was wrong.
Shifting subjects for critique, Lewis argued that the worst example of public misinformation has been taking place for nearly 70 years and is waged on the America public not by the government, but by tobacco corporations.
“There is none more egregious,” he said. “Not a single instance — including the wars of the 20th century and the genocides — matches what I’m about to tell you.”
Lewis began by describing studies that have showed the disastrous effects of smoking on health and also spoke of the tobacco industry’s response to the negative publicity.
“The tobacco CEOs met at the Plaza Hotel in New York and devised a PR strategy to mislead the public,” Lewis said.
He described the advertisements and public health studies that were virtually designed to ensure the survival of big tobacco.
“For 60 years, they kept up a subterfuge that it is to say, as recent as 1994, you had several CEOs swearing under oath that smoking was not harmful to your health,” he said. “None of those people were prosecuted for perjury, and they all disappeared quietly in the next several years.”
Lewis also singled out the media for being vulnerable to the whims of its advertisers, and in some cases, being too close to the government. He had three pieces of advice to repair what his book describes as “the decline of America’s moral integrity.”
“History should not be left for the next century,” Lewis said. “We need to change the accessibility of information.”
Lewis also called on American citizens to hold their government, corporations and media accountable.
“The public has to be resentful and mad and demand the truth,” he said. “There is a lack of engagement in this country, and right now this democracy is creeping along pretty shabbily.”
His third and final piece of advice was for students of journalism, seeking to make a difference.
“My advice to all of them is three simple words: Follow your passion,” he said. “If you care about what you do and you love what you do, you’ll be happy the rest of your life, healthier than anyone else, and you’ll make money.”

After USC grappled with a campus shooting in October 2012, Hadley Greswold, a senior majoring in health promotion and disease prevention, began ruminating on ways to unite the broader community. After months of work, she founded the Trojan Youth Soccer League, a nonprofit sports league affiliated with USC that serves South Central youths.

“The motivation came out of a desire to make the area around USC safe for everyone in the community. I felt that the most effective approach to making the area safe was this positive activity that could bring members of the community together,” Greswold said.
Though Greswold has since stepped down from her role as president, she continues to be involved in the organization.
She reflected fondly on its nascent stages and the organization’s first practice — it was her project coming into fruition.
“It had been a dream in my head,” Greswold said. “There were always doubts and challenges in the beginning. To see it in reality is the coolest feeling.”
Trojan Youth Soccer League has come a long way, however, since then. What began as eight teams of 7- to 9-year-olds has now expanded to 13 teams of 5- to 12-year-olds. With 30 staff members and over 65 students who have volunteered with the organization, TYSL is growing quickly. Though just a few seasons into the program, it has managed to garner national attention for its innovative model. Greswold and one other staff member were flown to Washington, D.C. to present their concept at the 2014 Urban Soccer Symposium. University students running a soccer league is a one-of-a-kind framework. Greswold feels it has potential to be a blueprint for other colleges and universities.
“Our dream is for other universities to pick up this model and create a soccer for social change across the nation because it’s already been so beneficial for our community at USC,” Greswold said.
What makes the league unique is that TYSL caters to the families of South Central. It has partnered with the City of Los Angeles, which has provided support by enabling the league to keep the cost of membership low. The city donates insurance coverage for all the players, which drives cost down to just $30 per player each season. For many in the community, the opportunity to join a soccer league is particularly exciting, as it would not otherwise have been financially feasible. Though the financial accessibility remains the cornerstone of the program, it’s the energy and commitment of the volunteers that makes TYSL so special, according to Greswold.
“I have been blown away by the volunteer culture in the USC student body,” Greswold said. “They have demonstrated this incredible drive to contribute to the community. Without that passion, without that volunteerism, it wouldn’t be what it is today.”
Hannah Vega, director of marketing for the league, joined in the spring semester, and began coaching a group of 12 kids. Having played soccer her entire life, Vega said she saw TYSL as an opportunity to become involved in a smaller community within the broader network of USC. She credited the outside community for the League’s success.
“It’s been so successful because all the families are all really passionate about their kids learning soccer,” Vega said. “There was a family with an older son and two younger siblings. The little kids would be on the sidelines with the parents. They would always come up to us and ask what they can do to help. They were just really involved. They came for all the games and all the practices. Now that we have expanded the program, their whole family is really heavily involved.”
According to Vega, it’s this exact closeness among the parents, coaches and players that will help the program evolve far into the future. One of the most exciting parts for TYSL’s founder is the knowledge that it will inevitably grow with talent that’s now leading it. Jocelyn Eng, president of TYSL since Greswold stepped down, shares the same ambitions for the future. She hopes to expand the program with every coming season.
“I see Trojan Soccer League becoming a really impactful soccer league in South Central,” Eng said. “We have such a great age range. We get such a variety of students. I think just cultivating the TYSL culture, which has already been established really well. We have such positive energy between the coaches, family and kids. I want to see that grow.”
A positive environment has become a hallmark of the league in bringing together students, USC community members, coaches, athletes and families.
“USC students love the opportunity to break down [the divide] between the school and community,” Eng said.
As they grow, TYSL is also looking for new volunteers to continue nurturing the program.
“The main characteristic that we look for is energy,” Greswold said. “It’s a pillar of our program: a positive attitude and energy. That’s what makes a good coach, and energy is contagious. When they bring that to the team, it makes for an incredible season.”

With its NCAA playoff position hanging in the balance in the season’s closing stages, the No. 3 USC men’s water polo team will try to topple No. 1 UCLA in the rubber match between crosstown rivals this Sunday.
T-Rex · Senior driver Rex Butler and the Trojans will face UCLA for the third time this season on Sunday. Butler has 32 goals so far in 2014. – Ralf Cheung | Daily Trojan
The Trojans (18-3) and the Bruins (21-2) each hold one win over the other in the 2014 season series. The two sides’ first meeting on Sept. 21 ended with the Bruins handing the Trojans their first loss of the year 9-7 to eliminate USC from the Kap7 NorCal Classic. Their most recent meeting on Oct. 12 ended with the Trojans knocking off the Bruins 10-6 in Westwood on the way to winning the SoCal Tournament championship. Sunday’s battle for Los Angeles supremacy will take place at Troy, and while the two sides will not be fighting for a tournament title, their third meeting of the season could have significant implications on the NCAA championship tournament.
“This [game is] a little more important because we are tied one and one, and the team that wins this game will have an advantage in terms of head to head records when it comes down to selecting teams to the NCAA tournament,” Trojan head coach Jovan Vavic said. “We still have four very difficult games left in the conference, and other teams do too. So there’s still a lot of water polo left to play, and one loss here and there can really make a difference.”
Sophomore driver Nick Bell reiterated the weight of Sunday’s matchup within the conference containing the “Big Four” teams of NCAA men’s water polo.
“It’s definitely a very important game,” Bell said. “Three teams are going to go to the NCAA tournament in our conference, and right now we have the top four [in the nation]. The team who wins our conference goes to the NCAA tournament for sure. The next teams might end up tied at the end of the season, and it could go to the heads of the conference to decide who goes, so this game would be a big win for us.”
The Trojans bounced back from a down-to-the wire 11-10 loss to Stanford with emphatic wins over Loyola Marymount and Pacific last week, defeating the Lions and Tigers 19-7 and 11-6 respectively. Having been knocked down from the top spot in the rankings with the Stanford loss, the Trojans will look to resurge as they did in their SoCal tournament victory, which Vavic says was fueled by the team’s loss to the Bruins at the beginning of the season.
“You get more focused [after losing],” Vavic said. “When you win games, you get a tendency to relax and think you are too good. And when you lose, you look at your preparation with a more critical eye, and try to figure out how to do better.”
Defense can’t be stressed enough around the Trojan camp as the team aims to take down the top-ranked Bruins. USC will want to curb the efforts of Bruin utility Cristiano Mirarchi, who leads UCLA in scoring with 37 goals on the year, and center Gordon Marshall, who’s tallied nine goals through the Bruins’ last three games.
“The last time we played UCLA, we did a really good job on defense, so our coach is going to go back to what we did right, and we’re going to try to repeat that,” senior driver Kostas Genidounias said.
The battle for Southern California water polo is set to take place 7 p.m. PT Sunday at Uytengsu Aquatic Center.

On Wednesday I headed out to USC football practice and asked a few players about their favorite Halloween traditions. I originally wanted to ask them what they were going to dress up as for Halloween, but I realized that they’d be on the road for their matchup at Washington State this Saturday, so they’re unable to really celebrate the holiday.
Instead, I asked them about their favorite Halloween candy, movie and costume as a kid. So I decided I’d take it upon myself to write a column suggesting hypothetical costumes for them. Prepare yourself for all sorts of terrible metaphors.
Steve Sarkisian: Furby
When I was six years old, I was beyond excited to get a Furby for Christmas. They were all the rage, and I loved mine. For about a month. And then I realized how creepy it was, looking like a mix between a hamster and an owl. After it blurted out one too many words in its weird language, I made the tough decision to take the batteries out and relegate the toy to the back of my closet.
Fast forward to Aug. 30 of this year: USC football’s home opener against Fresno State. The Trojans were flying high, and Sark made a statement by running a Pac-12 record 105 plays against the Bulldogs, silencing any doubters who were underwhelmed by Athletic Director Pat Haden’s decision to hire him.
Sark followed that performance up with an impressive win at Stanford the next week, but has gone 3-3 since with two last-minute losses, and now USC fans are doing what they do best: calling for their coach’s head. Indeed, Sark has fallen out of favor with the Trojan faithful.
Can Sark get this season back on track? If not, he might fall from grace, just like those old majestic Furbies.
Leonard Williams: Simba
This one is too easy. Williams’ frizzy mane of hair has earned him the nickname “Leo the Lion,” and he even has a tattoo of a lion’s face on his hand.
Aside from his hair, Williams resembles Simba in that he is still so young and has the whole world in front of him. The Daytona Beach, Florida, native is just 20 years old and will likely enter the 2015 NFL Draft before he turns 21.
Most players with his talent and football IQ have taken a redshirt year and had the extra time to improve their game, but even when Williams had the opportunity to redshirt (after injuring himself in fall camp in 2013) he decided to play through the pain all season.
The NFL is his for the taking, and he just can’t wait to be king.
Buck Allen: Thomas the Tank Engine
I wish there existed a more menacing train to compare Buck to, but Thomas & Friends will have to do. Hopefully you get the point.
Buck Allen has been a force to be reckoned with this season, posting more than 100 rush yards in seven of the Trojans’ eight games so far.
Opponents are starting to realize that when he’s rolling, they’d better get out of the way — the Tallahassee, Florida, native, who blossomed under the tutelage of former interim head coach Ed Orgeron last season, is averaging 138.4 rushing yards over the past five games.
Allen’s emergence as a workhouse has allowed Steve “Furby” Sarkisian to run a well-balanced offensive attack, of which Allen is the clear choice for MVP.
Choo-choo, Buck. Choo-choo.
JuJu Smith and Adoree’ Jackson: Twins from The Shining
These talented freshmen have got to give opposing teams nightmares.
They’ve been making explosive plays since the very first game of the season, when Smith broke a USC freshman record in a season opener with 123 receiving yards.
Jackson has added a number of explosive plays of his own, including a kick return touchdown against Utah that put USC back in the lead late in the second quarter.
These two, who both came to USC as two-way players, have been frighteningly good so early (Smith is still just 17 years old) and definitely represent the future of the program.

USC will attempt to bounce back from a tough loss for the third time this season on Saturday afternoon, when the team is set to face the high-flying Washington State Cougars in Pullman, Washington. The Trojans (5-3, 4-2 Pac-12) fell to No. 18 Utah in devastating fashion last week, while the Cougars (2-6, 1-4) have lost three straight games since a one-point win over the Utes on Sept. 27. Though Washington State must win out to match its six-win 2013 output, USC head coach Steve Sarkisian has been impressed with what he has seen of the Cougars’ unique offense.

“Their passing game is their running game — it’s both,” Sarkisian said. “It’s all about the numbing repetition of the same plays over and over again, and their quarterback’s comfort with those plays and his receivers. They’re a talented group and it’ll be a great challenge for us.”
Washington State’s offensive success begins and ends with quarterback Connor Halliday, one of the most prolific passers in college football history. Halliday, who set an NCAA record with 734 passing yards in a single game earlier this month, leads the nation by a wide margin with 3,833 yards through eight games. The redshirt senior’s 32 touchdowns are also tops in the country. USC sophomore linebacker Su’a Cravens addressed the challenge that Halliday presents.
“Their quarterback throws the ball a lot,” Cravens said. “We’re gonna get pressure on him, I’m confident in our D-line. You grow up [and] do your job, that’s all you have to do. We’re real confident in our abilities and we feel confident that we match up well with these guys.”
Though Washington State wide receiver Vince Mayle leads the Pac-12 with 926 receiving yards, Halliday has managed to spread the wealth to a variety of targets thus far. Including Mayle, seven Cougars have more than 20 receptions. Even more impressively, Mayle and fellow wideouts River Cracraft, Isiah Myers and Dom Williams all have over 500 receiving yards. Limiting this talented group will be a difficult task, a fact that USC senior safety Gerald Bowman and the rest of the Trojans’ secondary has recognized.
“We have to make sure we’re tight in coverage and be tight on the ball,” Bowman said. “They do a pretty good job of spreading it out, so we gotta execute on the ball when its thrown. Obviously we don’t want to get beat deep.”
Through all their offensive brilliance, the Cougars have been less than spectacular on the other side of the ball. The team is tied for 94th in the country in total defense, allowing 444.6 yards per game. Head coach Mike Leach’s squad has given up over 30 points five times this season, including in each of its last three games. Continuing to expose this weak unit will be crucial for Sarkisian and USC.
“They have a very aggressive front,” Sarkisian said. “They’re good at trying to get after the quarterback and stop the run. They play a lot of plays; when you have an offense that throws the ball 75-80 times a game the clock stops. That means the defense is on the field a lot. So hopefully we can take advantage of some of those things.”
The injury bug bit the Trojans hard against Utah, with redshirt sophomore left tackle Chad Wheeler falling to a torn ACL and senior linebacker J.R. Tavai suffering a sprained knee. Wheeler will miss the remainder of the season while Tavai should be out for the next two games.
Freshman Toa Lobendahn will slide over from guard to tackle to take over for Wheeler, opening up a spot for freshman Damien Mama. Redshirt sophomore Scott Felix will start in place of Tavai, a move that Sarkisian feels could benefit the team against Washington State’s prolific aerial attack.
“[Felix] is a little more athletic, but he’s not as big or as physical as J.R. [Tavai],” Sarkisian said. “Scott’s [Felix] a little better when we ask him to drop in coverage. It’s all about just continuing to fight for consistency with him. He’s going to make good plays because he’s a really good player.”
USC leads the all-time series 58-9 with four ties. Last season, the Cougars picked up their first road win against the Trojans since 2000, prevailing in an ugly 10-7 slugfest. Sarkisian is confident that this year’s contest will be different.
“We’ve got an extremely resilient group,” the first-year coach said. “We’ve got great leaders. It’s really a great group of guys.”
The game kicks off from Martin Stadium this Saturday at 1:30 p.m. and can be seen on the Pac-12 networks.
If our secondary gets torched and we lose this game, Wilcox needs to come to reality and move Su’a Cravens back to Safety. He is without question one of the best Safeties in college football. SC has arguably lost every game this year because we do not have a rangy Safety to make plays at the end of the game. Of course he can make plays off the edge as he is an NFL talent. But a Safety can come up an stop a run from breaking loose at BC. Who doesn’t remember watching the replay after the Hail Mary and seeing Cravens positioned in the flat? Or forcing a true freshman Plattsburg to cover one on one at the end of the game. It’s a shame to see a good coach caught up in some gimmick. 
Must pressure the QB. Watch the Wazzu Zona game and you’ll see how they can be beat. Constant pressure at all times.

If the gods of election outcomes came down from the clouds, appeared to the Democrats in their dreams and told them they were going to lose a midterm election in the next decade but could pick which one it would be, every single Democrat should cheer for an absolute face-crushing in the midterm election that is four days from now.
I don’t write this hoping that Democrats will lose their majority in the Senate, or that the gap between the Republican majority and the Democrat minority in the House will widen, but rather to suggest that even if it does happen (and it looks likely to), it won’t matter for the Democrats. In fact, it might even do more to help them when it will matter — 2016.
First, it has been a bizarre midterm season. In the late spring and early summer, two issues (one for each party) consumed the midterm buzz. For the Democrats, there was Obamacare, which polled miserably for months and gave any Democrat incumbent night sweats. On the Republican side, there was immigration reform, which a majority of polled Americans supported, but which Republicans in the House of Representatives refused to bring to a vote.
None of that matters as much anymore, because ISIS and Ebola happened. Though those issues won’t necessarily distract voters from perennial domestic problems, they have provided enough of an impact to knock Obamacare down to third on the list of national issues in a Wall Street Journal Poll, behind the economy and the ever-specific “dissatisfaction with government.” Even though the economy is doing well, the Ebola issue and, before it, ISIS, sucked much of the time away from Democrat incumbents who would have rather been talking about the steadily improving economy.
Even worse for Democrats, Ebola and ISIS have restructured the midterms into an election more focused on national security, which has increased the salience of Republican-based issues — Republican voters and the party do better when elections are about national security. To borrow a phrase from a campaign professional and friend of mine, the ISIS and Ebola issues have turned soccer moms into “security moms,” which doesn’t bode well for Democrats.
Second, even if the Republicans take the Democrats’ majority, they won’t take a large enough majority to pass things without Democrat support. Anyone who has glanced at a headline in the past year knows that when it comes to supporting each other’s ideas, Republicans and Democrats are more likely to hold hands and go Christmas caroling at the White House. In effect, the next two years will be a repeat of the last two: the only difference will be that Republican-authored legislation will be getting shut down instead of Democrat-authored legislation.
It could always be worse, though — one reason there has at least been some semblance of productivity in the Senate is that the Democrat majority has been able to (albeit very slowly) confirm many of the judges and executive officers that Obama has appointed. But a huge backlog of folks waiting to be confirmed still remains, and if that backlog gets worse, the Senate will be forever stuck in “confirmation land,” not in “law land.”
The third and most compelling reason that the midterms won’t matter for Democrats? The pain will only be temporary. In 2016, the next time Congress faces elections, several signs offer hope that the Democrats will roar back. First is the math issue: In 2016, 24 Republican Senate seats are up, compared to the Democrats’ 10. Unlike this year, which pits many candidates against each other in more Republican states, 2016 sees contests in many more Democrat-friendly territories. An additional weapon in the Democrats’ arsenal? Presidential election years encourage Democrat voters to turn out in more numbers than off years do. If the Republicans take the Senate, Democrat candidates in 2016 will be able to point at two years of gridlock under Republican leadership. The Democrats will also likely run Hillary Clinton, who is already wildly popular, for president. That gives Democrats a fighting chance in the House of Representatives, which means that unlike the next two years, one party could have both houses beyond 2016.
The premise of this article might sound like a coach who, seeing his team lose ground in the fourth quarter, puts in the second string and starts pumping the team up for the next game. Except it’s not: In fact, such a metaphor would be problematic for two reasons.
One, there is cause to suggest that this game doesn’t matter and in the next game, which matters more, the bookies have my team winning by a large spread.
Second, I’m a college student who goes to the University of Southern California. Around here, folks tend to avoid comparing themselves to football coaches.

LMAO!  O’Bola-Crat Liberals twisting into pretzels in their neurosis over their impending doom!  Yeah, keep telling yourself that – it’s all you have since the reality is so grim for you pack of reprobates.
Oh, and 2016?  Her Thighness?  LOL, oh you mean, “American businesses do NOT create a single job” – Clinton? 
 The one playing to empty seats and collapsing polling?   Wait until the Republican senate releases devastating information related to Benghazi.  The American People have the RIGHT to know!  Democrats don’t want them to know, for obvious reasons.  Not to mention that people plain just don’t like Hillary Clinton.  She couldn’t handle SoS let alone POTUS.
That will be amusing to see her and Liar-hontas Warren scratch each others eyes out while taking damage from Bernie Saunders, perhaps Al Gore entering and the oh so out for revenge and turn-the-tables exploiter – Monica Lewinsky keeping the whole world laughing at the sickening Democrat party.  
Monica for prez!   Why not?  Oh that’s right,  her only worth as a woman is as a humidor for Democrats and for Clinton to use and throw away.
You mad, bro? And really, could your comments be any more immature? Mysoginistic? Inaccurate?

Since its conception, marriage has carried complex connotations. It can represent a rite of passage to adulthood, a legal procedure, a financial merger, an act of commitment between two people in love or a combination of some or all of the above.
Marissa Renteria | Daily Trojan
As the concept of marriage continues to be redefined, people are changing their practices and it shows in the nation’s statistics. According to a Pew study released last month, there was a record share of Americans aged 25 years and older who have never been married — 20 percent. Only 13 percent of that group, however, claim they do not want to get married, which gives us a mere 2.6 percent of the population who reject marriage completely. It appears that most people are willing to flirt with the idea of marriage, but are not willing to commit to it as soon.
Though the statistics might come as a bit of a shock, this cautious attitude towards romantic relationships has been steadily pervading the dating world, and is crippling our ability to take leaps of faith. Trying to master the vocabulary of the college dating scene, which is rigged with implicit rules, is enough to daunt anyone. The nuances between the labels “just hooking up,” “seeing someone,” “being exclusive” and “dating,” are just the beginning of an extensive handbook to modern dating that we must individually scramble to piece together over the years, with the simple hope that ours is the same edition everyone else is using. On college campuses, being called “thirsty” or “desperate” is a high-stakes gamble one takes in just approaching a cute guy or girl in line at Starbucks.
What used to be a black-and-white situation has now transformed into a vast field of ambiguous stages between being platonic and officially dating. These stages are almost like a check-in point for the two people involved. Do you like me exactly as much as I like you? Yes. Good, I’m glad we’re on the same playing field. This subtextual exchange is a way of establishing and reaffirming the mutual responsibilities in a murkily defined relationship. Even dating apps like Tinder are based on this ideology of confirming someone is attracted to you before even talking to them. This insecurity about having unknown factors in a relationship is immediately opposed to commitment, which is essentially an investment of faith in an unpredictable future.
In a society where circumstances change in the blink of an eye and people are constantly rethinking themselves, it’s getting harder and harder to take a risk and jump into the unknown — especially if it potentially involves decades of commitment. We can divide everything that comes before marriage into several stages, during which it would be more or less permissible to back out at any stage; but the age-old concept of marriage would be violated if it were something that could easily be temporary.
One could argue that divorces already challenge the concept of marriage as a permanent status. According to the American Psychology Association, the divorce rate in the United States is around 40 to 50 percent; yet one would think that very few couples go into marriage intending to eventually divorce. It is what a person believes he or she is signing up for that is crucial to how that person will approach it. Because the social concept of marriage is established as a lifelong commitment, there is no room for double-checking. Naturally, in today’s society, this causes a degree of anxiety and many people simply put off this responsibility-heavy task for later.
Essentially, the declining marriage rates present a lose-lose situation for both men and women. It is not the social institution or connotations of marriage that must be upheld, but rather the concept of an enduring and reciprocal commitment between two individuals. It’s important for our generation to recognize the fine line between wisely choosing the people we commit to, and learning to take the occasional gamble and letting the unpredictable take its course.
Could it be that the more government involvement in people’s lives, the less people are willing to marry?
Mona,
I agree that the mindset today on marriage needs a revamping.  People have no respect for marriage and commitment and throw it away like a piece of toilet paper at the first instance of strong discord between one another.  No marriage is perfect but people have become so self-indulgent and hedonistic that bending for another just doesn’t float.  I am willing to say that many folks view marriage as an outdated vehicle in today’s society.  Marriage hasn’t changed but the people in society have.  Its unfortunate but we are where we are.  There will need to be a turnaround in this country before people begin to take marriage seriously again.  People are trying to redefine marriage now in other ways and it just shows that many folks want a free-for-all scene and as long as they don’t bother you it should be ok.  Granted we are in a free country and folks can do as they please for the most part, but I will be glad if there ever comes a time again when there is real value placed on marriage like there was many moons ago.

If you were to ask a college-educated person about politically active campuses in the United States, the University of Southern California might not be the first school that comes to mind. In recent years, however, USC has become a student body that is not only aware of social and political issues, but actively engaging and making an impact in their surrounding communities.
Whether it’s in the immediate vicinity of Los Angeles, or even in showing solidarity to protesters on the other side of the Pacific Rim, USC has a sprawling diversity of interests, and students all over campus are leading the charge in making their surrounding communities a better place. When Yasmeen Serhan and I envisioned this supplement, we wanted to capture a snapshot of the rapid growth USC is undergoing with regard to its political activity and the extent of student involvement. Though we couldn’t include every issue, we hope to capture a glimpse of how our fellow Trojans are making a genuine impact on the world around them.
Some acknowledgments: I’d like to extend a special thank you to Special Projects Editor Yasmeen Serhan, who worked tirelessly organizing and executing this supplement despite a myriad of commitments, as well as Design Director Mollie Berg, whose meticulous attention to detail and tireless work ethic resulted in the visual product you see before you. I’d also like to thank the Fall 2014 Daily Trojan Editorial Board and the Office of Student Publications for their contributions. Finally, I’d like to thank you, our readers, for your continued support and readership. We are honored to serve you.
Euno Lee, Editor-in-Chief

With the 2014 midterm elections quickly approaching, political partisanship has made its way back to the forefront of the national stage. Though USC’s campus community may seem more interested in football than politics at times, the political fervor hasn’t been lost on students — particularly for those in the College Democrats and College Republicans.
As two of the oldest political organizations on campus, the USC College Democrats and the USC College Republicans have always played an integral role in political life at USC. Dating back to 1912 and 1986, respectively, College Democrats and College Republicans aim to serve as a home for politically inclined Trojans.
Despite not having a major presidential campaign cycle in the works this year to garner mass attention on campus, both organizations have taken advantage of the midterm elections to be more selective and diverse in their club’s interests.

“Students interested in midterm elections aren’t automatically driven by the candidates at the top of the ticket,” said Jesse M. Unruh Institute of Politics Executive Director Dan Schnur. “Sometimes students get more excited about a candidate running for a down ticket office or by a ballot initiative.”
And both the College Democrats and College Republicans have done exactly that. Last spring, the College Democrats voted to endorse Sandra Fluke, a democratic candidate for the California State Senate. If elected, Fluke will serve California’s new 26th district.
“We had a very heated debate,” College Democrats President Alec White said of the endorsement. “But we decided to endorse [Fluke].”
The College Democrats have also focused their organizing around the midterm elections, endorsing a total of 20 candidates including California State Senate candidate Ted Lieu, California State Senate candidate Jose Solorio and California State Assembly candidate Sharon Quirk-Silva.
Similarly, the College Republicans have endorsed a total of 12 midterm election candidates, including former state legislator and former campus legislator in residence Tony Strickland, congressional candidate Elan Carr and California gubernatorial candidate Neel Kashkari.
In addition to bringing speakers and candidates from local races to campus, White said he and the College Democrats have also been committed to providing networking and volunteering opportunities for student democrats. Though the College Republicans have also focused the bulk of their programming on the midterm elections, College Republicans President Jennifer Massey said that she hopes to change this once the midterm campaigns end.
“After the elections are over, we’re going to have Republicans come out who are musicians and actors and businessmen,” Massey said. “I like to have a variety of speakers so we can see that conservatives come from different walks of life — not just politics.”
Massey stressed the importance of highlighting the diversity within the Republican party.
“We are a big tent, and a lot of times we seem to be painted with one brush,” Massey said. “We have libertarians, we have conservatives, we have social liberals — we have every kind of political combination there is. But we get boxed in by other people’s narratives, and it’s really unfortunate because it’s hard to get your voice out there when you’re the minority group on campus.”
Though the university has long held a reputation as a politically conservative campus, Massey said she always perceived the campus to be much more liberal. 
“The majority of the campus leans left, for sure,” Massey said. “I hear it everyday in my classes. Not just from students, but also from professors — it’s obvious.”
Despite the perceived campus political inclinations, however, Massey said most students don’t seem to be invested in politics.
“I really do think that most of the students are apathetic in general to politics,” Massey said. “At USC, everyone’s involved in so many things that you barely have time to do your grades, let alone other extracurricular activities.” 
White echoed sentiments of student political apathy. 
“An ideal campus would have a lot more activism in which everyone’s involved — both in domestic politics and campus politics,” White said. “These campus elections affect students. People care about having a better Leavey Library. People care about having a better Lyon Center. But, they don’t come out to vote.”
Though the Democrats and Republicans represent the two primary political parties on campus, White said politics at USC transcends the typical two-party binary.
“USC is a little different because I don’t think the Democrats and the Republicans are two main organizations for activism,” White said. “We kind of share that role with the Women’s Student Assembly, the Environmental Student Assembly and the Queer and Ally Student Assembly because they all advocate for a variety of specific issues.”
Though the College Democrats and College Republicans fall on opposite ends of the spectrum, hyper-partisanship doesn’t inhibit their ability to collaborate on campus. In fact, both organizations partner on a regular basis with the Unruh Institute of Politics. The Unruh Institute of Politics seeks to motivate students to become active in the world of politics, and holds a variety of programming with the College Democrats and College Republicans, including the biweekly Students Talk Back politics and public policy panel series.
Schnur said this collaboration is indicative of the Unruh Institute’s commitment to giving students a space to engage with their peers across the aisle.
“There’s plenty of opportunities both on campus and off for partisan political activity, but in our programing we try to create an environment where both sides can talk with each other and learn from each other,” Schnur said. “We’re not trying to rob them of their partisanship, but rather create opportunities for them to listen to another side instead of fighting with them.”

In the face of one of the worst droughts on record, Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti issued an executive directive challenging the city to reduce its water use by 20 percent over the next two and a half years. The severity of current environmental issues, both water-related and otherwise, has not escaped the notice of the USC community. On campus, students are working to shift campus culture and university policy to become more sustainability-focused.
The Environmental Student Assembly, which was formed last spring as a division of Program Board, is attempting to give a voice to individuals and groups on campus who are invested in environmental issues.

ESA Executive Director Shawn Rhoads said that prior to ESA’s formation, there was a disconnect between like-minded environmental groups on campus.
“There were these environmental organizations, but they didn’t know about each other. They didn’t really communicate with each other,” Rhoads said. “Two [organizations] were working on the same campaign at the same time, but they didn’t really know.”
Since its founding, ESA has fostered communication and collaboration between its 15 member organizations that are devoted to various environmental issues and has held several events related to those issues, including film screenings and events featuring speakers such as former Los Angeles Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa and actor Ian Somerhalder. ESA also co-hosted the Homecoming Rally and Carnival earlier this month, during which students powered the stage with bicycles. 
The Office of Sustainability’s Sustainability Program Manager Halli Bovia noted that campus culture regarding sustainability has improved during her three years at USC.
“We’re beginning to see a culture shift with the students, [including] the establishment of the Environmental Student Assembly,” Bovia said. “That’s been great.”
ESA originated in the Office of Sustainability, and the two entities have maintained a close partnership. Bovia highlighted the importance of this relationship, particularly since each can provide specific resources and support to the other.
“It’s so important to support students and their efforts in this area because we will never be able to do enough,” Bovia said. “ESA’s focus is really on environmental events for students. I think that’s fabulous [because the Office of Sustainability doesn’t] have the resources to put on events.”
Despite ESA’s founding and the increase of environmentally focused events, however, USC still seems to lag behind many other campuses in terms of sustainability. 
Daniel Redick, ESA’s external membership director and co-founder of national sustainability nonprofit Green Student Fund, attended two other colleges before transferring to USC and said he noticed a marked difference when he arrived on campus.
“The culture shift away from sustainability on campus when I got to USC was pretty amazing,” Redick said. “My first two colleges, Northern Arizona [University] and Santa Monica College, are very rooted in sustainable agendas and different environmental initiatives, while USC was not so much.”
Both Rhoads and Redick cited lack of support from the administration as a major obstacle to achieving a more sustainable USC.
“Getting USC to actually consider the environmental issues that are prevalent on campus … It definitely hasn’t been easy,” Rhoads said. “Sometimes it’s very hard to get administration on the same page.”
Vice Provost for Student Affairs Ainsley Carry responded to this by saying that Bovia, as well as USC Environmental Health & Safety Executive Director Dr. James Gibson, are two of the university’s administrators who are involved in promoting student sustainability efforts. 
“Over the years, [a sustainability] task force has launched a number of initiatives through student input,” Carry said in an email to the Daily Trojan. “The administration works hard to listen to student input from multiple venues — student government, student organizations, residence life. We appreciate student input and carefully consider ideas when they are brought forth.”
Rhoads specifically emphasized the necessity of greater support from the administration in terms of water conservation and recycling initiatives. He cited the need to decrease water usage in campus fountains and sprinkler systems, as well as the problematic aspects of USC’s current single-stream waste management system, in which all recyclable materials are mixed together instead of sorted by type.
“USC recycles, but it’s all single-stream,” Rhoads said, referring to the fact that the university employs third-party company Athens Services to sort out recyclables from the waste. “When that happens, where’s the conscious effort of USC students actually recycling? There’s no awareness.” 
Rhoads also noted that in single-stream waste management systems like the one USC uses, recyclables are often soiled by trash and are then no longer able to be recycled.
On-campus recycling is one initiative that is at the forefront of environmental efforts at other universities. At the University of California, Los Angeles, for example, there is an approximately one-to-one ratio of trash cans to recycling bins both on campus and in the university’s residential community. 
Kyle Hess, co-chair of UCLA’s largest sustainability organization, E3: Ecology, Economy, Equity, notes that his university’s emphasis on environmental research has enabled more effective sustainability on campus. Hess said UCLA has an initiative to become waste-free by 2020. 
“There was a recycling team that conducted a waste audit on campus to see the recycling habits of students,” Hess said. “Based on their research they designed a plan of where recycling bins should be located on campus … and they also designed a new bin and signage so that it would show people exactly what can be recycled versus what should be trashed or composted.”
Hess said that E3 has recently started an E-waste initiative on campus, providing bins and encouraging students to properly dispose of their electronic waste to make UCLA’s campus even more environmentally friendly. 
UCLA’s sustainability initiatives have received accolades from such entities as the Sierra Club, the Princeton Review and the Association for the Advancement of Sustainability in Higher Education. 
Though USC might not measure up to other campuses in regards to environmental issues yet, both Rhoads and Redick are optimistic about the future of sustainability on campus. Rhoads said that as the assembly continues to grow, students invested in environmental issues will have more opportunities to affect  change on campus. 
“It’s been very rewarding to have these students in our assembly be extremely passionate about something and ESA being able to support them and serve as their resource,” Rhoads said.
Redick also believes that continued efforts to communicate effectively with university administration can improve sustainability on campus.
“I think showing administration … how much that sustainable culture has been growing is huge because I think the administration is going to want to reflect its students as well as possible,” Redick said.

Political groups at USC have a substantial impact on student awareness and participation in the political process. For some international students who have never experienced the political freedoms that American students sometimes take for granted, that impact is much more personal and profound.
USC enrolls more international students, who collectively represent over 130 countries, than any other university in the country. International students do not have permanent residence or citizenship in the United States and instead study in the United States with a student visa. Because of citizenship and permanent residency requirements, international students can’t vote, which might lead one to expect little involvement of international students in political groups like the College Democrats, the College Republicans or the Political Student Assembly.
But time and time again, USC has demonstrated a trend of exceeding expectations — and one international student making a difference in California elections is living proof of that. 
Mina Moussa was born in Egypt and goes to school full time in Spain. He is studying business, finance and entrepreneurship at USC as an exchange student for the semester and is considering staying for the entire year. 
“I was quite interested that in the United States, you can actually have a say in politics and fight for your future,” Moussa said. “This never existed back home in Egypt, but maybe after this revolution, which is mainly the younger generation, it will.” 
Coming from a country that discourages political involvement, Moussa said he wants to experience the privilege many American students enjoy to have a say in their government, something that is often taken for granted. He began working for Republican Greg Conlon’s campaign for California State Treasurer because he wanted to make a difference.
“I got involved in his campaign because I agreed with what he was fighting for and it mattered most to me,” Moussa said.   
Jennifer Massey is another student for whom politics matters. Massey, who has served as the president of the USC College Republicans for two years, spoke of the involvement of students from places like India, China, the Czech Republic, Russia and Israel.
Seventeen percent of the student body is made up of international students, but Massey said the College Republicans’ percentage of international students is likely below that. 
“A lot of students are apathetic to politics in general,” Massey said. “Some that are Republican or Democrat don’t come and join a group at all, so anytime an international student who can’t vote takes an interest, it’s surprising to me. But, sometimes they are more active than our students who are voters.”
Her counterpart in the USC College Democrats, President Alec White, agreed. White indicated that involvement of international students in the USC College Democrats is minimal, and “definitely below” the 17 percent mark. 
“Part of it might be that we do a lot of stuff focused on domestic policy, as opposed to international relations,” White said. “Right now we’re really focused on electing Democrats to the state assembly, and after that, we’ll be focusing on the city council elections coming up in March.” 
For the College Democrats and other student political groups, the focus on elections comes at the expense of recruiting specific demographics such as international students. White indicated that next semester could be an ideal time to recruit international students like Moussa but said nothing has been planned yet. 
“Maybe our club has too much focus on domestic policy,” White said. “We could bring in some speakers to talk about international politics, or speakers who could talk about issues going on in the home countries of international students.” 
Clubs like the College Democrats and College Republicans only tell part of the story; the Undergraduate Student Government’s International Students Assembly, which is responsible for programming for all of the international students on campus, is headed by executive director Rachel Zou, a junior majoring in business who was born in China before moving to the United States, where she has lived for most of her life.  
According to Zou, ISA has prioritized social and professional programming at the expense of encouraging political involvement. 
“We have not done any programming for international students to get involved in political life,” said Zou, who is also the former director of professional and political affairs for ISA.  “International students mostly come here to get an education and to get a job, and we saw the need for ISA to provide those resources.”
Luke Phillips, the outgoing director of the Political Students Assembly, also said international students aren’t getting as involved as their domestic counterparts. 
According to Phillips, “[International Students] are not very well represented within PSA and USG in general.”
USG Vice President Rini Sampath agreed with Zou’s sentiments about the emphasis on social and educational integration rather than political involvement. 
“Especially for international students, the focus is on the education and social climate, a lot of things that we who have grown up here don’t think about,” Sampath said. “When you have that to worry about, it’s hard to get involved on these other things on campus.” 
Some international students can certainly do both, particularly when it comes to issues that are physically and emotionally close to home for them. For example, USC’s Student Coalition Against Labor Exploitation has high international student participation which leaders believe is due to the group’s international focus on issues like labor exploitation in Bangladesh. 
“We have a good amount of international students that participate, particularly because we focus a lot on international work,” said Sarah Newell, a senior studying business administration and a member of SCALE’s leadership team. “Over the past year, we’ve met a lot of students from Bangladesh that have a lot of interest, and a lot of international students that come here are experts in the domestic issues of their country” 
In line with White’s advice and the example set by SCALE, Sampath suggested a partnership between the USG and the Jesse M. Unruh Institute of Politics to bring more international-focused speakers to campus and involve more international students in the discussion. 
“The Unruh Institute has been so wonderful at bringing speakers for events, like the Students Talk Back series,” Sampath said. “This might be the perfect gateway for us to target international students to attend events and engage in the political dialogue on campus.” 
Dan Schnur, executive director of the Unruh Institute, emphasized the bond that international students share with their domestic counterparts, despite their inability to vote. 
“Even if an international student can’t vote in this country, he or she is almost certain to share some common policy interests with U.S. interests,” Schnur said. “You don’t have to be able to vote in California to care about better schools, clean air, water, immigration or trade policy.” 
Schnur, who also teaches a campaign strategy class at the University of California, Berkeley, discussed the heavy involvement of international students at UC Berkeley who leave his class and take the lessons back to their home countries. 
“I get emails from former students working on campaigns in countries all over the world,” Schnur said. “One of USC’s greatest strengths is the international composition of its student body, and there is no question that we can do a better job of integrating those students not just academically and socially, but politically as well.”
Moussa believes the education and job opportunities that international students pursue is all the more reason for them to get politically involved. 
“With globalization, it tends to affect all of us,” Moussa said. “Many international students that come to USC tend to land jobs in the U.S. It does affect you.” 


Congrats to all because being an international student isn’t easy, given our complex culture and language. Assistance must come from various sources, including involvement in student government. A new award-winning worldwide book/ebook to help anyone coming to the US is “What Foreigners Need To Know About America From A To Z: How to Understand Crazy American Culture, People, Government, Business, Language and More.” It paints a revealing picture of America for those who will benefit from a better understanding, including international students. It has been used in colleges for foreign Fulbright student classes. Endorsed worldwide by ambassadors, educators, and editors, it also identifies “foreigners” who became successful in the US and how they contributed to our society, including students.
   A chapter on education explains how to be
accepted to an American university and cope with a new culture, friendship
process and classroom differences they will encounter. Some stay after
graduation. It has chapters that explain how US businesses operate and how to
get a job (which differs from most countries), a must for those who want to
work for an American firm here or overseas. It also has chapters that identify
the most common English grammar and speech problems foreigners have and tips
for easily overcoming them, the number one stumbling block they say they have
to succeeding here. 
   Most struggle in their efforts and need guidance from schools’ international departments, immigration protection, host families, concerned neighbors and fellow
students, and books like this to extend a cultural helping hand so we all have
a win-win situation.  Good luck to all wherever you study!

It’s another day of blue skies and sunshine here at USC. Students stroll to class as bikes whiz past in a blur. Cathie So, a first-year physics graduate student, makes her way down Trousdale Parkway amid the morning rush. As she scans the brick-paved roads of Troy, her newfound home of nearly half a semester, her thoughts can’t help but flicker back to the roads of another city, one near and dear to her heart. In Hong Kong, 7,236 miles away, those streets too are alive with the chatter of students. But something sets them apart.

For more than a month now, tens of thousands have braved cold nights and sweltering days on Hong Kong’s bustling streets, yellow ribbons pinned against black T-shirts in solidarity, umbrellas ready to be used at a moment’s notice as shields from the sting of tear gas. These scenes capture the cries of a city, the bleeding hearts of a generation that has risked everything — from the searing haze of pepper spray to the possibility of imprisonment — for a better future where true democracy and universal suffrage constitute not the stuff of dreams, but the roots of a new reality.
Though the Hong Kong protests officially began on Sept. 28, tensions were already building in the months leading up to them. The last straw came on Aug. 31, when China announced it would grant Hong Kong’s citizens “universal suffrage” for the 2017 chief executive election, but under one condition: The people of Hong Kong only be allowed to choose from two or three candidates pre-selected by the Chinese government. Decried as an outright sham, the ruling drove demonstrators of the Hong Kong Federation of Students, Scholarism and Occupy Central with Love and Peace — many of them college and high school students — to the streets in one of the world’s most peaceful protests. In later weeks, police brutality and caustic anti-Occupy Central demonstrators — not to mention mounting frustration and impatience among citizens at the impasse with government officials — have fueled an increasingly volatile atmosphere.
Soon after tear gas was unleashed on thousands of peaceful protesters on Sept. 28, So and five other USC students came together to form USC for Democracy in Hong Kong, an organization that aims to spread awareness about the protests and show solidarity for student protesters.
“There are many personal friends of our members who are there in Hong Kong now at the protests,” said So, who serves as one of the organization’s members. “We don’t feel the pressure the same way they do, but we can show them that someone else in the world doesn’t want them to give up.”
Despite being a nascent student organization, the group now boasts more than 30 members. It hosted its first tabling event on Oct. 6 to raise awareness on campus. Photos of members and passersby holding posters emblazoned with messages addressed to the students in the protests were shared on Facebook and with online media outlets in Hong Kong. The group also helps the Hong Kong Forum – Los Angeles, a nonprofit organization aimed at promoting democracy and human rights in Hong Kong and China, make banners for various rallies held in downtown Los Angeles.
So stressed that Hong Kong’s past is integral to understanding the protests.
“Many people already have an idea of what’s happening in Hong Kong, but they just don’t know the history behind [it],” she said. “They know the students are fighting for democracy, they know there’s a protest, they know the police is using too much force — but they don’t really know the background of all of this.”
From the time of its establishment as a small fishing port ceded to Britain to its return to China in 1997 as a financial powerhouse, Hong Kong has always been the pawn of an empire. An agreement for a 50-year adjustment period to mainland rule was drawn up, with the “one country, two systems” policy promising the territory a high degree of autonomy from Beijing. Many take China’s stringent ruling as a backtrack on that promise.
“We get to vote, but we don’t get to nominate or control who gets nominated, so until that gets done, our organization will remain,” So said.
Calvin Chau, a senior majoring in business administration, is also a core member of USCDHK. Like So, he believes that the protests have shown Hong Kong’s younger generations that civil disobedience is a viable path toward a better system.
“China’s a different story, but Hong Kong is absolutely ready for [democracy] — it was ready 20 years ago,” Chau said. “Before this movement, people were reluctant to go against the authority to fight for their rights, but right now, they’ve completely changed their minds, especially among the youngsters.”
For students from Hong Kong following the movement from abroad, however, the experience is bittersweet.
“It’s so easy to feel helpless, I think, when you’re so far away, because other than gathering with other Hong Kongers and talking about it, what can you really do?” said Michelle Toh, a senior majoring in print and digital journalism. “I have friends who go to university in Hong Kong. My friend’s parents almost got tear-gassed the night that they started unleashing pepper spray on protesters and everything. It’s just really shocking to see, and I think that everybody has become a lot more homesick and felt much more of an affinity to what they didn’t even realize could be taken away.”
Thirty-three years remain until Hong Kong reverts to full Chinese governance. The trajectory toward 2047 is a particularly troubling issue for the Hong Kong youth, who will inherit the new political reality. Many Hong Kong citizens have voiced concern that the central government has already begun eroding freedoms — including an independent judiciary and open press — that make the city unique in an undemocratic country.
Of those concerns, the biggest fear seems to be the uncertainty surrounding the 50-year agreement — what it entails, and what will become of the city when it expires. With the help of the Political Student Assembly, Jessie Chen, a senior majoring in international relations, organized “The Future of ‘One Country, Two Systems,’” a forum held on Oct. 13 at the Ronald Tutor Campus Center, to discuss the road ahead for Hong Kong.
Chen, who lived in Hong Kong for 18 years before coming to USC, found that many students here weren’t even aware of the demonstrations.
“It was all over my Facebook newsfeed, but when I asked other people who had never lived Hong Kong or had any experience there, they didn’t know about it at all,” Chen said. “So the point of the panel discussion wasn’t necessarily to pick a side, argue for a side, to advocate for democracy or advocate for the other side, or anything. I really just wanted people to know about it.”
The USC International Relations Undergraduate Association and the Student Coalition for Asian Pacific Empowerment also co-hosted a discussion about Occupy Central on Oct. 7.
Though no actual student group against the pro-democracy movement has appeared on campus, a Facebook page titled “USC Anti-Occupy Central Pro-Democracy Organization” sprung up soon after USCDHK was formed. At other campuses, tensions have mounted as well. Toh said she talked to a friend at Wellesley College who told her that the Oct. 1 campaign “Wear Yellow for Hong Kong,” started by Harvard University student Heather Pickerell, was decried by Wellesley’s Chinese Students’ Association, whose members felt that the campaign was anti-China.
To Toh, the animosity seems uncalled for, especially at a time when division can be especially dangerous.
“So many people are now thinking that autonomy necessarily means that we want to break away from China, but that’s not what we’re saying,” Toh said. “It’s important to stay united, especially among students who are of the same age and probably value a lot of the same things.”
Though Hong Kong will eventually settle back into the daily grind, the issues with the central government and its grip on Hong Kong’s destiny will not be forgotten. As Chau said, “The end of this stage of occupation [might be] a retreat, but it’s definitely not a sign of surrender.”
The students should not go to Beijing as these students are
just like parrots, repeating the same kind of sayings. They thought that the
senior officials have not heard what they said. However, this is not right.
They thought that their demands and sayings have been filtered or twisted. So,
they need to talk to the senior officials directly. This is not right again. 
In the last meeting with the HK government officials, they
did not give any new request, just reiterating the same. Also, they could not
make any response to the four points from Mrs Lam. Most people expected that
they would keep saying the same things. And they did. How can this level of
political representatives be able to meet very senior officials? 
As for Joshua Wong, the one-to-two-years-old video shows
that he advocates the same thing to the leader of the Democratic Party (Hong
Kong), Mr Ho, over and over again. All he can say in this video clip is asking
for the highest (citizen nomination) because they need to put their lives at
risk in protests and demonstrations. He does not listen to Mr Ho but just
repeat again and again. 
These students are not wise in politics at all. 
Perhaps, all they can do is yelling the motto. 
Anyhow, Mr Joshua Wong deems himself and is deemed by the
supporters as the hero in the success of stopping the go-ahead of the national
curriculum. That is why he keeps demanding that anything is possible, citing
the miraculous changes in “number 23 – national security ordinance”
and “national curriculum”. 
If the above two incidents are really that strong in
supporting the current demand of “citizen nomination”, make a review
on them. Firstly, the “number 23 – national security ordinance”
should have passed. The change did not rise from the Chinese side but from the
sudden resignation of the leader of the Liberal Party. As for the second one
(national curriculum), the change was again not from the Chinese government but
likely from the Hong Kong government. 
This “national curriculum” incident was not as
important to the Chinese government as it did not mean a kind of national
security at all. So, it quite wrong to think the Chinese government will buckle
this time. Hong Kong government buckled actually, not the Chinese government. 
The other consideration is about “spoiling”. Both
governments may think that if they concede too much this time, the students may
ask more again later in other issues. They don’t want to spoil these
“political kids”. 
Also, one of the reports alleges that these students did not
show enough respect to the more matured participants, like Mr Benny Tai,
leading him to retreat to his teaching in the university. Just that this Mr
Joshua Wong had get success in the “national curriculum” incident, he
does not listen to any adult, like the leader of Democratic Party.
After all, they should not go to Beijing as they have no
idea about what they are doing. They have no bargaining technique. And they
have nothing new to offer.
I could be wrong, but I believe that there were 200,000 people at the peak of the movement, around October 1st according to Occupy movement and Scholarism leaders?

Nestled in the heart of the Silicon Valley, Monta Vista High School in Cupertino is notorious for being one of the most academically intense in the state. With Apple’s headquarters just a stone’s throw away and many of the residents employed in the technology industry, Monta Vista has an undeniable emphasis on math and science. Within this high-tech world, USC alumna Catherine Shieh found her true calling: politics.
“I just clearly didn’t fit the math and science mold, and I had other strengths besides every other Monta Vista student,” Shieh said.
Her sister suggested joining Vision New America, a program that focuses on increasing civic engagement among underrepresented youth by placing high school students into state legislative offices. Shieh was placed in the office of then-State Assemblymember Joe Coto (D-District 23).
“I realized that politics isn’t that bad.There are a lot of good people, [for example] staffers and other names that you don’t hear, and these are people who truly do want to figure out what is best for everybody,” Shieh said. “Politics is so tricky because you technically shouldn’t be excluding anybody, and I think that’s so fascinating. To realize that good intentions can go somewhere in politics was inspiring, and I realized this is where I’m meant to be.”
Shieh continued her political involvement at USC. She began as a student worker for the Jesse M. Unruh Institute of Politics, which she said “got [her] foot in the door.” In addition to serving as finance director and president of the USC College Democrats, she went on to intern for the campaign finance firm Maravich Associates LLC, as well as a several campaigns — including current Congresswoman Janice Hahn’s congressional campaign, Senator Dianne Feinstein’s re-election campaign and current State Assemblymember Sebastian Ridley-Thomas’ campaign. She also interned for the nonprofit California Forward and for Congressman Mike Honda.
Shieh focused on civil rights and Asian-American issues while working for Honda. She also helped open the Congressional Anti-Bullying Caucus, which launched in June 2012 and focuses on preventing bullying in educational institutions and other establishments. 
Shieh said the political culture of USC did not concern her as much as political culture in general, especially the lack of engagement among minorities, particularly Asian Americans.
“Asian Americans, at the end of the day, are the least likely to vote, the least likely to get health insurance, the least likely to be civically engaged, the least likely to be anywhere in politics,” Shieh said. “The fact that, among my peers, I will be the only Asian American, let alone the only Asian-American female, they’ll encounter, I knew very early on I was not going to be like everyone else.”
After graduating in December 2013, Shieh moved to Washington D.C. to intern for Congressman Ami Bera of California’s 7th Congressional District. She continued her work on Asian-American issues as well as pharmaceutical drug regulations. Drawing on her experience working for Honda, she was asked to help create the California Public Higher Education Caucus for Bera. Shieh said that following the passage of Proposition 13 in 1978, the University of California and California State University schools have become more dependent on the federal government for funding. The caucus will advocate for the two state university systems and focus on improving quality, affordability and accessibility of higher education. 
“America depends on California, California needs to advocate for itself,” Shieh said. 
Shieh emphasized the importance of civic engagement and political involvement for students.
“If you don’t vote, don’t complain because that’s no longer your place,” Shieh said. “We forget that people fought and died to make sure that we can vote. Those who identify as undocumented, they would willingly do anything for their voice to be heard and their voice legally cannot be heard. Voting is your first responsibility, and there are 11 million undocumented Americans who don’t have that luxury.”
According to Shieh, the most pernicious force in politics is not bad intentions, but apathy. 
“I don’t think there are a lot of ‘bad people’ who are in politics,” Shieh said. “I think there’s just enough people that are willing to opt out of politics, which means they are OK with what’s happening, and when you have enough people that are OK with the status quo that makes things the way they are, and that make it stay and that makes that power stay and it’s more apathy that will hurt us than people with mal intentions.”
She advised students interested in politics to remember the power of asking for what they want. 
“Always advocate for yourself, and always ask,” Shieh said. “You never know who’s going to be your friend at the end of the day, and especially trying to get people of color to be involved, it’s always on the individual to ask for more resources, always ask for that business card, always ask to meet up a second time, always ask for that email, always ask for an opportunity because all that takes is an ask. I know that I would clearly not be where I am today if I didn’t have a boss who told me, ‘You always have to ask.’”

“Always advocate for yourself, and always ask,” Shieh said. “You never know who’s going to be your friend at the end of the day, and especially trying to get people of color to be involved, it’s always on the individual to ask for more resources, always ask for that business card, always ask to meet up a second time, always ask for that email, always ask for an opportunity because all that takes is an ask. I know that I would clearly not be where I am today if I didn’t have a boss who told me, ‘You always have to ask.’”

Unruh Institute Director and former California Secretary of State candidate Dan Schnur granted the Daily Trojan an interview to talk about his recent campaign as a No Party Preference candidate — and what that means for the future of politics.  The following interview has been edited for space.


Could you talk about why you ran for California Secretary of State without a party affiliation?
I think there’s two questions there. One is why I became a No Party Preference voter, and the second is why it’s so important to the office. To answer in reverse order, it’s a pretty straightforward answer. The umpire shouldn’t be wearing a Dodgers or a Giants jersey, and by the same token, the state’s Chief Election Officer shouldn’t be Democrat or Republican. So I think it’s very important for the Secretary of State to be someone who isn’t beholden to either party.
The other question is why I became No Party Preference. Like an increasing number of voters, I’ve begun to find that both parties are more ideologically extreme than my own political preferences. I’m for lower taxes and marriage equality, I’m tough on crime and I’m pro-choice, I believe that citizenship is a necessary part of immigration reform and that student test scores are a necessary part of teacher evaluation. That puts me fundamentally at both parties on a number of issues that are important to me.

I feel like there’s a lot more pragmatism to that view, but when people see voters lined up on party lines and voting along party lines, there’s a feeling of solidarity. Where is that feeling of solidarity between No Party Preference voters, who might have seemingly disparate views? How do you generate solidarity in a voter base like that?
We know that [No Party Preference] voters might hold both major parties in very low regard, but voters still use those traditional party identifiers as cues when they don’t have a great deal of other information available about the candidates. On one hand, the No Party Preference voting bloc is the fastest growing in California. On the other hand, it’s going to be some time before voters begin to relate that alternative to a particular set of policy and political choices. 

When you were running for Secretary of State did you notice a larger section of NPP voters? 
Something we certainly noticed during the campaign is that there’s been a great deal of statistical evidence in recent years to back up that instinct. Data shows NPP voters are now almost one quarter of the electorate in California. Polling shows that number is even greater among the millennial generation. 
Voters generally are increasingly identifying as independent of either party, but younger voters are doing so in much greater number. I’ve got a theory on that — my generation grew up in an era where there were three networks on the television and five buttons on the radio. We’re used to having a limited number of choices available. Today’s college students grew up in an era with an infinite number of entertainment options available to them. If you can have a thousand cable channels and literally millions of websites to visit, why in the world would you want to limit yourself to only two options when it comes to politics?
But I am the second most important person in this conversation when it comes to millennial-based decisions, what’s your take on the situation?

I don’t want to say that millennials are more educated, but I want to say that the fact that so much more information is available to us gives us the critical decision-making skills to allow us to discern between partisan politics, and what kind of policy we might want to get behind as it pertains to our personal well-being — much in the same way democracy was intended to function. 
It’s definitely not going to work as a two-party system in the future. But to bring this discussion back to you and what Unruh does, what kind of organizations are there to harbor this type of discussion on campus? 
There is not, not to my knowledge … Almost by definition, an organization of independents is an oxymoron. Where you begin to see those alternatives spring up on campus or in our community is around individual issues, rather than a third-party movement. The average person in college or elsewhere in the world doesn’t think, “I need to be a vanguard to start a third party alternative to Democrats and Republicans.” More likely is that they think, “Neither party is satisfactorily addressing my concerns about this particular issue, so I’m going to get involved with an organization that could make the kind of change that could work.” 

Is there anything else you wanted us to take away from your campaign for Secretary of State that we should have taken away as students?
I don’t believe that [an] independent or NPP voter is inherently superior in any way to a member of one of the traditional parties. I would never dream of trying to convince a student who’s a principled conservative or a principled progressive to become more moderate. But one of the goals, one of the main goals of my campaign, was to make it clear that in addition to the principled progressives and the principled conservatives who populate California politics, is that there’s a need for a more aggressive option in between the 40-yard lines.
I tell the students in my class that the difference between politics and football is that in politics, the victories come between the 40-yard lines. Even the most principled progressive or principled conservative in the world can’t make change exactly the way they want it, as long as we live in a democracy and not a monarchy. So the question becomes, “How do you bring those principled individuals on both sides closer to the middle in order to get something done?”

“It’s really hard for me to say I love USC or that I love being a Trojan because in reality, I don’t,” said Makiah Green, a graduate student in the master of professional writing program. “I don’t feel like my existence is valued.” 
Green is just one of the many students at USC who feels underappreciated and misrepresented when walking around campus. In a recent survey conducted by the Undergraduate Student Government, 36 percent of 116 black students surveyed ranked “sense of belonging” as one of the lowest satisfying components of their USC experience. 
For some students, the night of May 4, 2013, illustrates this lack of acceptance. A noise complaint at an off-campus, student-hosted party quickly escalated to become a racially charged incident in which at least 79 Los Angeles Police Department officers in riot gear were brought to shut down the party at the home of undergraduate Nate Howard, then a senior majoring in communication. Photos taken by several guests depicted the officers arresting students, shoving them against cop cars and creating a human blockade on the street to prevent attendees from getting to their cars. Guests believe the magnitude of the police’s reaction and the excessive use of force was due to racial bias, since most of the party’s attendees were either black or Latino. Potential bias was further exposed by the fact that across the street, another party of equal hype — this one attended primarily by white students — was allowed to continue uninterrupted. 
“I had flashbacks to an era I wasn’t even alive to suffer through,” Green said on her personal blog in a post titled, “I’m A Scholar, Not A Criminal: The Plight of Black Students at USC.” “I was too scared to go outside, legitimately fearing that an officer would see me and arrest me for being black and inquisitive.”
Following the controversial events of May 4, many involved with the party gathered at Howard’s home to discuss their rights as students and citizens. What began as late night discussions among the party attendees rapidly evolved into a student-driven social media movement dubbed the #USChangeMovement. Students questioned why the university’s Dept. of Public Safety was not there to control the situation and why the administration made no move to protect its own students against the actions of the LAPD. To the party’s attendees, the university failed to ensure students felt equally respected. 
“The problem here isn’t that our party got shut down,” Howard said. “The problem here is racial profiling; the issue is with the school’s Dept. of Public Safety and LAPD.”
The students behind the #USChangeMovement staged a sit-in at Tommy Trojan and organized an open forum, inviting students, alumni, faculty and community members to the Ronald Tutor Campus Center Ballroom to discuss the role of race in the arrest of the six students with the LAPD and DPS.
Though most of the party attendees have graduated, the #USChangeMovement’s legacy continues to inspire conversation and action. In February, Howard gave a TEDx Talk at San Diego State University on racial profiling, recalling the incident at his house party and explaining how the social injustice inspired him to create a program called “BE The Voice.” His newest project is a high school program aimed to help children find their voice in an environment where racial inequality is prevalent.
Azmera Hammouri-Davis, a junior majoring in social sciences, believes the movement has altered her outlook on social change. 
“It got me to devote everything I do to social justice,” Hammouri-Davis said. “It’s what’s given me more heart to just continue to serve. Everything I do now ties back to #USChangeMovement.”
Most recently, USG Vice President Rini Sampath credited #USChangeMovement for playing a critical role in triggering open conversations on racial profiling and student comfort at USC. USG is currently working to pass a resolution to create a physical space that will serve as a cultural hub for the diverse group of black students on campus. Sampath believes the Black House project shares a common goal with #USChangeMovement in striving toward equal treatment for minority students.
“We’ve seen different incidents on campus where black students are singled out to some degree and that’s the reason and inspiration for this particular resolution,” Sampath said.
Though Green, Howard and many other students still feel undervalued in the community, it is evident that movements and resolutions have really been pushing for social justice within USC’s population. The most recently elected USG cabinet has already begun making strides toward the equal treatment of students, with projects like gender-neutral housing, which aims to provide students of all sexual orientation with comfortable and non-discriminatory housing. 
Sampath said USC’s administration has also been very receptive. She said Vice Provost for Student Affairs Ainsley Carry, especially, has acted as a valued ally for the student body.
“I think we’re changing the game. We really made it a priority this year to make sure we’re the advocates of students,” Sampath said. “If we continue our persistence, we’ll be able to see some tangible changes on campus. I think that’s why this is a really pivotal moment in our university.”

For the past several weeks, the Political Student Assembly has sponsored multiple events per week, but that might change as the assembly takes a “quality over quantity” approach to becoming an effective resource for politically focused student organizations under the leadership of a new executive director.
Edwin Saucedo was voted in as PSA’s executive director Monday following former Executive Director Luke Phillips’ resignation. 
“PSA as it currently stands is too targeted to people who are already involved,” Saucedo said. “I feel like the purpose of Program Board is to serve the student body as a whole. My goal and vision for the remainder of the semester and the upcoming semester would be to attract a larger audience through political events that bring in big names and appeal to a larger audience … bring that diversity in and make sure everyone in the student body has a chance to become politically involved.”

The main purpose of the assembly, one of nine assemblies in Program Board within the Undergraduate Student Government, is to promote political discourse and action among students, a mission they carries out through various speaker and discussion-based events and by supporting the political activism of students and groups on campus. PSA is considered the umbrella organization that supports and advises about 16 member organizations, including the USC College Democrats, USC College Republicans, Student Coalition Against Labor Exploitation and Young Americans for Liberty.
PSA holds weekly meetings on Mondays for its own executive board members, member organization representatives and students interested in becoming involved in politics at USC. A speaker event typically takes up the first hour of the meeting, while the second hour consists of official business, such as voting on funding requests and which events PSA will co-sponsor with member organizations.
USC Red Cross Member President Adrienne Visani serves as her organization’s representative in PSA. She said the assembly allows her to connect with leaders of other organizations and find ways to emphasize USC Red Cross’s political aspects, including international services and human rights.
“As a pre-med student, it’s easy to lose sight of the fact that people are politically engaged,” Visani said. “It’s one of the reasons I wanted to bring up the political element of USC Red Cross. Because we have a lot of pre-med members, it’s nice to get them exposed to other things that are going on that really do have an impact on people’s health, just not in the way you might think.”
Visani said PSA has helped spread the word about her organization’s events, provide a network of support and provide vital funding, such as awarding funds to fly in a guest speaker.
Though PSA manages several member organizations, many of opposing viewpoints, the assembly itself is a neutral party. PSA does not endorse any political view, candidate or position, but it does support the right of its constituents to express and lobby for their respective views.
PSA Assistant Director Kevin Tsukii said that the assembly vigilantly works to remain nonpartisan at all times.
“It’s kind of a struggle to be as impartial as possible, to be unbiased and to welcome as many different viewpoints as possible,” Tsukii said. “We have to find a way to balance all of our programming. It’s being political without favoring one or the other too much and getting people to join the discussion without turning people off.”
Though PSA takes a nonpartisan approach, the group does work with member organizations to encourage political engagement within the student body through actions such as registering voters on Trousdale Parkway.
Nonetheless, Tsukii said that the differing political views of PSA’s member organizations do surface often.
“There’s kind of this underlying tension because you know what other people are thinking when they say things, but it’s really great how we’re able to kind of laugh it off and just get along together and move forward,” Tsukii said. “In an assembly like this, that’s what makes a lot of our events great, the discourse that happens.”
In addition to more intimate events about politics, PSA hopes to bring more well-known political figures to campus in the future, according to Saucedo. Last fall, PSA co-sponsored an event that brought comedian and political commentator Bill Maher to speak before a packed audience in Bovard Auditorium.
Saucedo also said that PSA will continue to host forums for students to talk about current events. Past events of this nature include a talk about the protests in Ferguson, Missouri, and those in Hong Kong. 
“People are really interested in seeing current issues,” Saucedo said. “When we did the Ferguson talks, for example, we had over 70 people because it was a current event. We had a professor come and speak about what it meant and what it means going forward. I want to continue doing these smaller events on topics that are affecting everyone.”
Despite the successes of their own events, several members of PSA feel that the organization struggles to combat general apathy toward politics on campus.
“It’s a very painfully slow process getting people involved in politics,” said Shikhar Gupta, PSA’s webmaster and a member of two PSA member organizations. “We’ve had really good showing at events at the beginning of the year, but it tapers off. People get busy with midterms, people don’t have the time or might not be engaged in certain issues. It gets frustrating at times, but it’s something that changes over a long period.”
Nonetheless, those involved with PSA feel that their goal of increasing political engagement among students, though at times a challenge, is a worthy cause.
“People always talk about how the millennial generation is going to have a huge influence on politics, but not yet. Not yet, because we’re still kids,” Phillips said. “But we need to be cultivating the minds of the millennials generation to be thinking about the issues that are going to be facing us as we get deeper into the 21st century. That is where I think PSA is going to have the biggest influence by bringing in inspiring speakers and interesting speakers and by giving students the chance to talk about these issues that they’ll have to deal with 10 or 20 years down the road.”

In an issue of the Daily Trojan from April 15, 1969, professor of education Nathaniel Hickerson wrote an article entitled “Students and the quasi-private University,” discussing the political role of college students during a particularly turbulent time in the nation’s history.
In it, he highlighted the shift of universities from institutions solely churning out working professionals to communities serving as a growing hotbed for political activism. 
“Students in large numbers are coming to view their campuses as the centers for producing socio-economic and political change in America,” Hickerson wrote. “They are in effect saying, ‘If we at the university do not spark the changes in America, then who will?’”

More than 40 years later, it seems the role of student activists across the nation is still in flux, particularly at USC. Though USC was once a predominantly conservative-leaning institution, shifting attitudes and demographics among today’s students are redefining their political role and identification on campus.
“The millennial generation sees less and less a place for them in the traditional political system,” said Dan Schnur, the executive director of the Jesse M. Unruh Institute of Politics. “They are looking for other more immediate ways to make a difference.”
Schnur said he feels students today contribute heavily in volunteer and community-based engagement, a model of activism he describes as less noticeable. 
“Fifty years ago, a college student defined political involvement as marching against the Vietnam War,” Schnur said. “Today that same student is more likely to be teaching an at-risk child to read, or involved in a neighborhood watch or community clean up. Those ways of being involved don’t attract as much attention.” 
In addition to off-campus outreach, there are official student organizations on campus that work to foster a greater community for political discourse and activism. A common difficulty in such organizations, however, has been generating enough student interest in high-level political discussion. 
“Politics at USC is there and it’s growing, but it’s not one of the prime focuses of university life,” said Luke Phillips, the outgoing executive director of the Political Student Assembly. “There is a lot of academic level movement toward giving USC a higher national voice, but what I think is lacking at the moment is a simultaneous student commitment to making USC a part of the national conversation.”
PSA, founded in 2007, predominantly hosts discussions and panels relating to contemporary political issues in an effort to encourage greater student engagement. 
 “The model we’re striving for is hitting hot button political issues as they happen and planning discussions that are attended organically,” Phillips said. 
What seems to be lacking on campus, however, is the air of public student activism that was prominently seen during the 1960s and ‘70s. Phillips shared that in pursuit of promoting said discussions, there has been difficulty in accommodating students who are “more on the activist side of things.” 
“When [on-campus demonstrations] happen, it’s excellent,” Phillips said. “[But] I don’t necessarily think that expanding the amounts of sit-ins and rallies we have would necessarily make USC’s image more as a political university. That can help, but the big thing has to come in more discussion and more of the silent variety of activism.”
Not all student organizations, however, agree with idea of “behind-the-scenes” activism, a terminology some find contradictory to the type of action necessary to initiate change. 
“I love speaker panels, and I go to them frequently, and I think having an engaged discussion is very important,” said Sarah Newell, a member of the Student Coalition Against Labor Exploitation. “But I think the secondary step to discussion is taking those ideas and putting them into action and USC is often missing that part.”
SCALE is one of the campus’s more outspoken organizations, often emphasizing activism in the form of public demonstrations. Last spring, the group held an 18-person sit-in outside President C.L. Max Nikias’ office in Bovard Auditorium, protesting against the school’s relationship with JanSport, a company that SCALE members assert utilizes sweatshop labor practices. 
Newell said the university has reached such a point where it is now necessary to work outside the system, and hence necessitates public disobedience.  
“Genuine political activism that’s going to make genuine change is always going to have to go outside the lines,” Newell said, “Since the ’60s and ’70s, political activism has changed because our universities have figured out ways to channel student energy into something that they control. They’ve created power structures, and they’ve allowed us to do what we want within the power structures they created, but genuine political activity challenges the accepted power structures.”
The two sides of the spectrum, however, seem to agree on one thing: The political role of USC’s students is changing, and the university administration must do more to foster that growth. 
“We have the same goal — we both want to see a better USC,” Newell said. “I think the new USC student coming forward in the next 10 years is going to be very politically conscious. As a university, [USC] has to figure out how to adapt to that.”

The USC Good Neighbors Campaign, a grant program established on the heels of the 1992 Los Angeles riots, marked its 20th anniversary this October.
The GNC has spent the past two decades raising over $17.7 million dollars in support of building and sustaining a positive relationship with the local communities around USC’s campuses.
Last year, over 5,500 USC faculty and staff members raised more than $1.7 million dollars for the campaign, setting a new record.
“The campaign has grown significantly,” said Carolina Castillo, campaign director and executive director of development for USC Civic Engagement. “We have a pretty ambitious goal for the 20-year anniversary.”
This year’s goal for the campaign is set at $2 million.
“The Good Neighbors Campaign is a signature program for the university because of the impact we are able to have on our community,” Castillo said. “All of the funds and gifts that are collected for Good Neighbors come from university employees, staff and faculty.”
All of the money raised by the university’s employee giving program is used to support programs with an emphasis on providing enhanced educational opportunities, as well as those that serve the community through the promotion of health and well being and economic development.
The primary objectives for the 20th year of the GNC and onward include an increased focus on peer-to-peer outreach and increasing the GNC’s marketing efforts to broaden the visibility of the campaign. No specific event has been held to celebrate the campaign’s October anniversary. GNC looks forward to thanking donors, however, with a 20th Anniversary commemorative pin and two complimentary tickets to the USC v. Army men’s basketball game on Dec. 28.
Student-led organizations such as Troy Camp, Street Law and Young Researchers are among the 50 programs funded by the GNC.
“This is an opportunity also for our students to take advantage of their public service work that they are doing with the local community,” Castillo said of the opportunity the program provides in regard to student involvement and the development of civic-leadership skills.
Troy Camp is one example of an organization funded by the campaign that relies heavily on the involvement of student volunteers. The student-led youth development group seeks to broaden the horizons of children throughout the local community through long-term mentoring relationships with USC undergraduate students.
“For me, the most rewarding part of working with Troy Camp has been seeing the way that some of the kids open up to me and the other counselors. Being a kid is hard, no matter where you come from,” Troy Camp Director of Communication Brad Silling said. “I think one of the biggest benefits of Troy Camp is that it provides kids a safe space in which they’re free to express themselves and just be kids in a positive and goal-driven atmosphere.”
The generous contributions from the GNC make up a significant portion USC Troy Camp’s, as well as many other programs’, annual budgets and facilitate the continued success of such programs.
“The campaign has given us the opportunity to grow our weeklong summer camp in May, allowing us to take nearly 200 elementary school students in the past few years,” Silling said. “Without the support of the GNC, we would not be able to reach as many students and have such a strong relationship with families in the surrounding community.”
