After recording both a win and a loss in each of the last two weeks, the Women of Troy are hoping they can come away with two victories in Arizona this weekend.
Extra effort · Junior setter Kendall Bateman has helped lead the Women of Troy to a 14-2 record and an overall ranking of fifth this season. - Tim Tran | Daily Trojan 
The No. 5 USC women’s volleyball team will play Arizona State tonight before facing No. 25 Arizona on Saturday. Both matches start at 7 p.m.
Last weekend, USC lost to then-No. 1 Stanford after winning the first set. The next night they lost a 2-0 lead and just barely squeaked out the win against then-No. 7 California in five sets.
When looking back at this inconsistent play, USC coach Mick Haley said one of the main problems is a lack of consistency.
“We struggled with lack of rhythm at certain parts of the [match against Cal],” Haley said. “We have to fight through that.”
Regardless of the team’s impressive 14-2 record, Haley notes there are still a lot of areas his team has to focus on.
“We’ve got a lot to learn in the way of continuing to control matches,” Haley said. “But I believe the real culprit in doing this is still our defense. Our blocking at the net has to continually get better.”
To help improve the team’s weaker areas, the Women of Troy have spent the week practicing their transitions after kills, while also participating in competitive serving and receiving drills. But these extra efforts in practice cannot help the players deal with something else that might be distracting them — midterms.
“I’m really trying to get them to focus and study at the same time,” Haley said. “They get stronger as they go through it, especially the younger ones.”
Haley has six freshmen on his 16 roster team, and with midterms and other distractions standing in the way, he cannot deny he is a bit worried about his team having to travel and play the next two games on the road.
“I am real concerned, but there’s not anything I can do about it except keep us very organized, keep life simple and give them time to study that won’t affect their preparation for the matches,” Haley said.
First up for the Women of Troy is Arizona State. While the Sun Devils are just 6-11 this season and a mere 1-4 in the Pac-10, Haley is definitely not taking the team lightly.
“If [Arizona State] lose[s] twice this weekend, they could be looking at their season being over, and they can’t afford to have that happen. They’re at home. They’ve been playing well. They just haven’t won,” Haley said.
Facing Arizona will not be easy either, as the Women of Troy have lost two straight games in Tucson.
“I think it’s always difficult to play there,” Haley said. “They’re always ready for us.”
Despite USC’s high national ranking and impressive depth, Haley is not getting overconfident, especially when he considers how young his team is and how much room there is for improvement.
“I think we’ve really got our work cut out for us. This is not going to be easy at all,” Haley said. “It’s always hard playing at the Arizonas.”

Fresh off what arguably was its most exciting weekend of the season, the No. 19 USC women’s soccer team looks to continue strong as Pac-10 play carries on this weekend in Oregon.
Helping hands · Freshman goalkeeper Shelby Church has been an integral part of USC’s defense, recording seven shutouts this season. Despite USC’s success thus far, Church said that the team can’t take any Pac-10 opponent lightly. - Katelynn Whitaker | Daily Trojan 
The Women of Troy (8-3-2) will take on Oregon State (9-1-1) tonight at 7 p.m. in Corvallis, Ore., and move on to Eugene, Ore., to face Oregon (4-6-2) at 1 p.m. on Sunday.
A week ago, USC lost by one goal to top-ranked Stanford. After falling behind 2-0, the Women of Troy cut the deficit to one and nearly netted a dramatic equalizer in the final five minutes. On Sunday, they played what USC coach Ali Khosroshahin called “one of the craziest games I’ve been involved in.”
After jumping out to a 2-0 lead in the first four minutes over then-No. 21 California, USC conceded four second-half goals — including three in the last 15 minutes — to give Cal a stunning 4-3 lead. Unlike against Stanford, the Women of Troy were able to punch in an 89th-minute tying score before winning on a golden goal free kick five minutes into overtime.
After such an impressive weekend, it would be fair to expect a bit of a letdown. But freshman goalkeeper Shelby Church disagreed.
“We can’t take anyone lightly,” Church said. “Last year we lost to Oregon State. Everyone in our conference is tough, and we have to come out strong and play hard and play the way we’re capable of playing.”
Last year USC lost to Oregon State for the first time in 15 years, and the Beavers are no slouch this season either. They won their first five games in shutout fashion, and seven of their nine wins this season have come without conceding a goal. In fact, the Beavers have allowed just seven goals all year. But Khosroshahin insists his focus is on the Women of Troy.
“We try not to get caught up in opponents and ride that roller coaster,” he said. “We just try to keep the focus on ourselves and get better each day.”
Oregon State is coming off a big weekend as well, winning its rivalry game against Oregon 3-2 after star Chelsea Buckland scored the game winner in the 86th minute.
It was Oregon’s third loss in a row, a stretch in which the Ducks have allowed nine goals. Oregon’s defense has been porous this season, failing to shut out a single team since August. USC will certainly be favored over a team that won just one Pac-10 game last year and has beaten the Women of Troy just once in 14 seasons.
But there are no guarantees from Khosroshahin.
“You can throw out records; you can throw out past performances,” he said. “Every year, every team in this conference is capable of beating anyone else. You’ve got to show up and bring it.”

When I wrote my last column, USC was 4-0. Undefeated. The fans were happy.
Now, just two weeks later, USC is 4-2, the Trojans having lost two consecutive games for the first time since 2001. The fans, as you might guess, are not happy.
What’s changed?
Two things: one, a sad-but-true realization and an incredible stroke of bad luck. Let’s break it down.
First, as was probably under-reported earlier this year, these Trojans have not put together a complete performance all season.
By complete, I mean the offense, defense and special teams all playing above average.
And by never, I mean never — not in spring practice, not in summer workouts and not in fall camp. In fact, USC’s best overall day since Lane Kiffin and most of his coaching staff arrived in January was probably Saturday’s game against Stanford.
Yes, the Trojans lost that game. No, I am not joking.
But you have to give it to Kiffin and his team, who have responded well to adversity this week in practice. Those are my words, not those of anybody on the team — although they agree.
“I don’t think you can tell, off of them, whether we won or lost the game,” Kiffin said Wednesday when asked to evaluate his team’s feelings at this point in the season. “I don’t think they’re any different in practice, which is the same the week before [concerning their morale], and now you can’t go undefeated, you lost to Washington at home in the last second. ”
He continued, saying this week’s packed injury report is much more of a concern to him than anything that happened last week.
“I’m not worried about that,” he said. “I’m much more worried about who is going to be there to play Saturday.”
That brings me to my next point. A typical excuse for underachieving teams is that they have been ravaged by injuries.
Up until this week, you couldn’t say that for this USC team. This is the first week that a substantial amount of key players look like questionable bets to play on Saturday.
But I’m not sure I’d call them “underachieving” either.
Did the losses to Stanford and Washington really scream that fateful word — “upset?”
You don’t have to answer that. I’ll tell you one thing, though: They did scream “unlucky.”
And that’s the second thing. Both losses were extremely unlucky. There are all kinds of crazy statistics about just how abnormal the two consecutive last-play losses were.
“It’s very unusual,” Kiffin said earlier this week. “We were talking today and USC has played football for more than 100 years and there have been four games in 100 years, prior to these last two weeks, that USC has lost on the last play of the game. Four in 100 years, and now we’ve done it twice in seven days,”Kiffin said.
“That’s a record that we didn’t really want to break or be a part of. The fact is that we should learn from it and know that feeling and how it is, and have a feeling for it never happening again, so when we’re in those situations, we change one thing and we’re sitting here completely different.”
But they’re not, of course. And now questions are starting to float in about whether Kiffin’s debut season will end up resembling his predecessor’s.
Remember, former USC coach Pete Carroll’s 2001 squad finished 6-6.
“It feels different because the expectations are so much higher,” Kiffin said when asked to compare 2010 with 2001. Kiffin was an assistant on that team.
“I know we’re better. We were 2-5 to start that year. This is a better team with higher expectations, so it feels a lot different.”
He’s right. It feels different. And so far, it’s been different. But a loss Saturday to Cal could end up making the two seasons feel awfully alike.
And, with Oregon the next team awaiting the Trojans after a bye week, Cal looks an awful lot like a must-win game.
Otherwise, 4-4 is well within reach.

It took only one thing for USC men’s water polo coach Jovan Vavic to start questioning his team’s identity — a 5-3 road loss to Stanford.
“We’re going to find out what kind of team we are,” Vavic said, referring to USC’s upcoming clash with California. “We’ll see how we rebound.”
After 13 games away from the friendly confines of McDonald’s Swim Stadium, USC is coming home. The No. 1 Trojans (15-1, 1-1) will return from an exhausting road trip to dive into familiar waters for a Mountain Pacific Sports Federation matchup with No. 2 Cal Saturday at 10 a.m.
But for the first time in 2010, the Trojans are faced with the challenge of rebounding from an agonizing defeat against a team that they had defeated on 17 consecutive occasions.
“We just missed our shots,” Vavic said. “Maybe we were both tired and unfocused. Certainly, we did not look like ourselves in that game when we were shooting the ball.”
But as the nation’s second-ranked team descends upon Los Angeles, USC will have to do more than just put the ball in the opposing net. Instead, the Trojans will be forced to contend with one of the country’s best offensive units.
“They do a number of things very well,” Vavic said. “In particular, they have two great Serbian scorers who are very dangerous. They’re a great offensive team.”
The two players referenced are junior attackers Ivan Rackov and Luka Saponjic, who lead the team with 36 and 21 goals respectively, and are also members of the Serbian national team.
But despite Cal’s offensive prowess, the Trojans’ defensive unit remains just as nationally prominent — largely because of its anchor, junior goalie Joel Dennerley, who is having arguably the best season of his collegiate career after already being named MPSF Player of the Week twice this season.
“He’s a focused athlete,” Vavic said. “He wants to play in the Olympics, so he really understands that he has to get better and improve.”
In recent weeks, Dennerley has been as sharp as ever. Against UCLA in the SoCal Tournament championship game, he tallied 15 saves. Even in defeat against Stanford, he finished with four saves and surrendered just five goals — below the team’s per game average of 5.9 goals.
Even with Dennerley’s consistency, however, Saturday’s contest will likely hinge on the team’s offensive capabilities, which were tough to notice against Stanford.
“I don’t think our guys were really following through in regards to where we told them to shoot the ball,” Vavic said. “We talked about how to beat the goalie and where to shoot the ball, but we did not do what we were talking about.”
If following the game plan means anything, it often results in balanced scoring. Thus far this season, the Trojans — who average a conference best 14.6 goals per game — have a total of eight players averaging at least one goal per contest.
“We really don’t plan to give this guy or that guy a shot,” Vavic said. “We really play to what the situation is. If we play to the opponent, and see what they’re doing, we’ll be OK.”
But even more notable might be the fact that two freshmen, two-meter Jeremy Davie and driver Nikola Vavic, lead the team in scoring with a combined 53 goals on the year.
Even relying on freshmen hasn’t stopped the team from swimming past many of the challenges thrown its way.
Outside of their loss in Palo Alto, Calif., the Trojans have posted a 15-game winning streak, which included NorCal and SoCal tournament titles.
“We have done a very good job of winning games when we really needed to,” Vavic said. “We’ve really been fantastic in pressure situations. I feel that this team has a tendency to rise to the occasion and I think they can do it again.”

Podcast: Sports editors James Bianchi and Kenny Legan preview the upcoming game versus the Golden Bears.
After spending three of its last four weeks on the road, USC returns to the Coliseum Saturday looking to avoid its first three-game losing streak since 2001.
Ready to fire · Sophomore quarterback Matt Barkley has led a strong Trojan offensive attack this season, but it has not been enough to secure victory in their last two games. Saturday, he will lead USC against Cal, who boasts a top-10 defense nationally. - Dieuwertje Kast | Daily Trojan 
The Trojans will face the California Golden Bears and their Pac-10-leading defense. Kickoff is scheduled for 12:30 p.m.
The unranked Trojans (4-2) could easily be undefeated if not for two consecutive last-second field goals against both Washington and Stanford. USC looks to bounce back from those two emotional losses against a Golden Bears (3-2) squad coming off a dominating 35-7 win against UCLA.
This game will likely be decided when USC has the ball. Cal boasts the best defense in the conference, allowing only 106 rushing yards per game and ranks in the top-25 nationally in every major defensive category. Meanwhile, the Trojans have the second-best offense in the Pac-10, averaging 476 yards per game.
USC has settled into a nice offensive rhythm in its last two games, but it faces perhaps the biggest test of the season this week.
“Cal’s probably the best defense we’ve faced thus far,” sophomore quarterback Matt Barkley said.
The Bears’ defense has been stellar, save for giving up 52 points to Nevada’s pistol offense in its second game. But in every other game, Cal hasn’t given up more than 10 points.
The Bears are among the best in the conference at breaking down the offensive line. Their 3-4 defense has sacked opponents 16 times in five games.
The Trojans, however, should be used to the 3-4 by now; Stanford ran the same scheme and the Trojans were able to put up five touchdowns.
“It’s an easy transition from last week,” Barkley said. “Structurally, on defense they’re really similar to Stanford.”
Freshman wide receiver Robert Woods caught three of USC’s touchdowns last week. If the true freshman wasn’t a secret before the Stanford game, his breakout performance took care of that.
With Woods emerging as a legitimate offensive option, Cal can’t afford to focus all of its attention on senior wide receiver Ronald Johnson.
“You have to be aware of all our threats, so you can’t really double-team one guy any more,” Barkley said.
In addition to his offensive workload, Woods also received serious reps at defensive back this week in practice. The former Gardena Serra High School standout intercepted 23 passes in high school and played on both sides of the ball.
Kiffin said he is looking to develop two-way players in anticipation of having a smaller squad when the sanctions go into full effect.
Although USC’s passing game produced 390 yards last week, the running attack had an off week. Senior tailback Allen Bradford rushed for only 33 yards while redshirt junior tailback Marc Tyler had just 12.
“I’ve got to be a little more patient on some runs and explode on others,” Bradford said Wednesday.
Freshman tailback Dillon Baxter has been held out of practice with a foot injury, so senior C.J. Gable will be the third running back to see the field for the Trojans.
It won’t matter if USC continues its defensive woes, as long as the Trojans can put up points on Cal’s defense. Cal is not an offensive juggernaut, ranking sixth in the Pac-10, but neither was Washington. The Trojans gave up 536 yards to the Huskies.
The Trojans expect to see a lot of Cal running back Shane Vereen,  who leads the Bears with 593 yards and eight touchdowns.
“Defensively, run [defense] is the issue for us this week,” Kiffin said. “This is about running the ball. [Cal quarterback Kevin] Riley can throw the ball but I think he’s going to turn around and hand it off 50 times, so we’re going to have to be ready.”
The Trojans have won their last six meetings with Cal, including eight of their last nine.

Jackass 3D
Rated R
All of Steve-O and the gang’s wonderfully juvenile stunts will explode from the screen in stunning 3-D in the group’s return to the movies after a four-year hiatus. Porta-potty rockets, beehive tetherball and human duck hunting are only the milder stunts that were allowed in the film’s trailer. Viewers can expect the Jackass crew to utilize its newest film’s 3-D format for all its worth with the most explicit and daring stunts yet.
 
Red
Rated PG-13
When a ruthless assassin threatens the life of retired CIA agent Frank Moses, the agent enlists the help of his old team. Though the revenge tale is familiar, it is the film’s cast that is the real draw here. Bruce Willis, Morgan Freeman, John Malkovich, Mary-Louise Parker and the queen herself, Helen Mirren, represent a wildly diverse cast that should be a lot of fun to watch.
 
Conviction
Rated R
Hilary Swank plays a former high school dropout and single mother who, after the wrongful murder conviction of her brother, works her way through law school and fights for her brother’s innocence. The film, based on actual events, will be sure to tug on your heartstrings. The versatile Sam Rockwell and Minnie Driver provide supporting roles.
Hi,
Nice post with good writing skills. I like your post so much. It’s very useful for me.
Thanks.

Ten years after the birth of Jackass on MTV, the affable stuntmen are now gearing up for the release of their third theatrical release, Jackass 3D, which hits theaters today. Similar to the previous two installments, this documentary-style threequel is packed with 90 minutes of crude, dangerous and hilarious stunts with one exception — it’s in 3-D.
High five · Among the film’s many painful and hilarious jokes is a contraption shaped like a giant hand, that, when triggered, swings around the corner of hallway and right into one unsuspecting victim. - Photo courtesy of Paramount Pictures 
This time around the Jackass guys took advantage of the studio’s deep pockets and had a 3-D phantom camera made just for them. The first of its kind, the camera shoots at a significantly high rate of frames per second, allowing viewers to watch the daredevils suffer painful genital injuries in some of the most sublime slow-motion sequences known to film.
In a recent interview, the film’s director Jeff Tremaine expressed delight over the film’s 3-D results.
“It feels like you’re right in the middle of a stunt or prank with us. It really elevated the movie to a whole other level,” he said. “Like, this bit, ‘The Beehive Tetherball,’ we’re playing tetherball with a beehive, and it feels like 50,000 bees are swarming around the theater or around your head.”
Although the 3-D technology certainly enhances the audiences’ theatrical experience of the film, it wasn’t used as a crutch in substitution of comedic material. As ringleader Johnny Knoxville said, “We wrote ideas that had to be funny in 2-D first. That was kind of the rule.”
Perhaps that is the reason why this film raises the bar for comedic stunts — even by Jackass standards. The guys fearlessly — and recklessly — find themselves in physically outrageous situations not much different from what you might expect to happen to Wile E. Coyote in an episode of Looney Tunes.
Speaking of cartoons, Knoxville cited animated shows, such as Tom and Jerry, as inspiration for many of his extreme cinematic ideas.
“I think sometimes Knoxville gets confused that life isn’t a cartoon,” said Jackass’ co-creator and producer Spike Jonze in an interview with The New York Times.
In one of the many memorable scenes, Knoxville, clad in a chic tuxedo, rides a jet ski off a ramp, crashing through a sturdy fence, only to walk off laughing. Although most people neither have the audacity nor the desire to perform stunts such as this, Knoxville and his friends seem to take pleasure in inflicting pain on themselves and each other. Admittedly, there isn’t a whole lot more that’s entertaining to watch.
Before filming big stunts, Knoxville typically uses a ritual to help get himself mentally prepared.
“About 20 minutes before it’s on, I’ll just go sit and listen to my cousin’s music or other music,” he said. “And then when it’s on, I’ll say, ‘Just come pat me on the shoulder,’ and I’ll walk right in and do it.”
Although the musical retreat might help ease his mind, there isn’t much to help prepare for the physical wreckage the cast’s bodies suffer from performing these wild stunts.
In a scene called “The Invisible Man,” a colorfully painted Knoxville attempts to blend in with a backdrop decorated with a rainbow and sunshine while standing inside a bullring. Unsurprisingly, the stuntman gets rammed by an angry bull, causing him to flip 360 degrees in the air, only to break the fall with his neck.
As if that isn’t enough to make you wince and laugh cathartically at the same time, the rest of the movie is full of equally hilarious, yet shocking, feats.
In another notable scene, retired snowboarder Ehren McGhehey extracts his front tooth in an extremely unconventional manner — by replacing the dentist with a Lamborghini. McGhehey attaches his upper right lateral incisor to a durable string, also tied to the back of the blazing Italian sports car. The car accelerates down a strip of concrete, and after a moment of trepidation, the tooth to flies off instantaneously, leaving a bloodied mouth and a large dental gap.
Although McGhehey — like his comrades — has suffered many stunt-related injuries, he continues to take pleasure in what he does.
“I’ve had 16 surgeries, but I don’t regret any one of them,” McGhehey told MTV.
Although it might be difficult to intellectualize Jackass, let alone call it art, it is certainly refreshing to see such a tight-knit group of friends perform hilarious physical comedy, and most importantly, have fun while doing it.
If you appreciate visual gags, Jackass 3D is at the least undeniably funny and at the most, a reawakening of your inner child.
Great article Amir!
Now it’s time to interview Burt Reynolds.

It’s hard to have more fun than to watch great actors have a great time on screen. Though the new action flick Red might not offer much in the way of plot, it showcases an unbeatable cast of seasoned actors who prove that they’ve still got it.
Retired CIA agent Frank Moses (Bruce Willis) struggles with his only recently normal life, until a team of assassins invades his home in the middle of the night. After skillfully killing them all, he escapes to the home of Sarah (Mary-Louise Parker), a receptionist with whom he has been flirting over the phone and who he believes could also be in danger.
Grumpy old men · Despite their age, the retired CIA agents of Red are more than capable of fighting, killing and humiliating their younger counterparts when they take them on. - Renee Cohn | Daily Trojan
Frank takes the initially unwilling Sarah with him as he assembles a team of fellow retirees, played by John Malkovich, Morgan Freeman and Helen Mirren, to figure out who is trying to kill him.
In the meantime, Frank is pursued by a cold, younger agent, William Cooper (Karl Urban). In the midst of car chases and a lot of shooting, the agents all get caught up in a political conspiracy to cover up government war crimes. But that’s not really important here.
What is important is the ease with which the fantastic cast elevates its run-of-the-mill action comedy into something utterly enjoyable. Ignore the overly complex, meandering political plotline and focus on the perfect chemistry between the four retirees.
For the most part, director Robert Schwentke successfully diverts audience attention from the somewhat incoherent storyline with fast-paced action and winning jokes. Only a few moments at the end get a little plot-heavy, causing Red to briefly lose some of its charm.
Fortunately, the audience is too won over by the actors to care. Smoothly stepping out of a spinning car and taking on an agent half his age, Willis proves that he is just as intense as he was in Die Hard more than 20 years ago.
And despite the tough exterior, he is just as good at being “gooey on the inside,” as Mirren’s character Victoria describes Frank. When Frank tells Sarah, “Your eyes are so beautiful” as he tapes her mouth shut to keep her from screaming, his genuine affection for her is adorable in the funniest possible way.
Freeman, the oldest and gentlest of the group, is just so undeniably lovable that the audience is instantly and loyally on his side.
Malkovich, playing the paranoid Marvin, gets by far the most laughs in the film, turning what could be corny one-liners into quirky, hysterical quips. Malkovich has been at his best recently when playing a crazy person, and he manages to subtly steal every scene as Marvin.
And what could be better than watching the eternally classy Mirren, resplendent in a long white gown, trying to kill people with a machine gun? Her performance is effortless and commands attention. And as Victoria explains what she sacrificed for her work, Mirren brings as much depth as possible to a movie with so little substance.
Really, these actors can do no wrong, and they are consistently a joy to watch.
The rest of the cast ably supports the stars and the story. As Sarah, Parker is charming and vivacious, but she doesn’t always fit into the chemistry created by the older actors, with whom she shares practically all of her scenes, and some of her cheesier lines fall flat. Urban, as Cooper, proves a worthy foe and straight man for Willis, exuding a power and energy that makes  the audience want to watch him. When the plot gets a too involved and overdramatic, Urban steps up his performance, making Cooper more sympathetic and dynamic without slipping into melodrama.
Brian Cox adds a nice touch to the group as a former Russian spy, and perhaps the only character to rival his love interest, Mirren, in class. Hollywood’s elder statesman Ernest Borgnine makes an amusing cameo as the CIA Records Keeper, representing a generation of actors that came well before Freeman and the rest.
Red is an adrenaline rush, a sweet romance, and an all-around good time. The movie is more fun than anything else, but director and actors alike embrace that fact and obviously enjoy themselves in doing so. And fortunately, Willis, Freeman, Mirren and Malkovich are all so talented that when they have fun, so does the audience.
As the Records Keeper says, “They just don’t make ’em like that anymore.”

On Wednesday night students and faculty gathered for a night of classical music. Piano, harpsichord and conducting professor Lucinda Carver gave a free recital alongside four guest artists. The show featured the works of Brahms and Schubert, as well as the Schumann Piano Quintet. It was an excellent show that appealed not just to classical fans but also to those whose taste might not stray beyond Top 40 hits.
Sound of strings · Cecilia Tsan played the cello as part of the five-piece concert, joining the other musicians in multi-part classical string-focused songs, including Brahms’ “Violin Sonata Number 3.” - Nathaniel Gonzalez | Daily Trojan 
With virtuosity and expression, Carver and colleagues Aimee Kreston (violin), Richard O’Neill (viola), Sarah Thornblade (violin) and Cecilia Tsan (cello) produced an entertaining night of music.
With a distinguished résumé including performances with the Los Angeles Philharmonic and National Symphony, Carver is an accomplished performer and teacher. Her recital Wednesday night reflected her skills as a pianist through accompaniment and collaboration.
The first piece performed, Franz Schubert’s “Arpeggione” Sonata, showcased violent O’Neill and Carver as an accompanist. Recipient of an Avery Fisher Award and Grammy nomination, O’Neill executed the three-movement sonata with precision and virtuosity.
Throughout the first movement,  Carver and O’Neill interacted with impressive meticulousness. O’Neill, who performed the piece from memory, portrayed a playfulness that meshed with the character of the upbeat movement.
The second and third movements were played with the same expertise. Carver’s skills as accompanist and solo pianist were obvious: Her talented interpretation and sensitivity to the dynamic variations in the viola’s melody added to the excitement of the piece. Both performers seemed to really be enjoying themselves — their expressive body language entertained the audience.
Following Schubert’s Sonata, Kreston on violin performed with Carver on Johannes Brahms’ “Violin Sonata No. 3.” Kreston, the former concertmaster for the Los Angeles Mozart Orchestra, a teacher and an internationally acclaimed soloist, performed a brilliant rendition of this Sonata, made only better when paired with Carver’s impeccable accompaniment.
The first movement began with a graceful line in both piano and violin. Its slow, relaxed beginning led to a buildup in intensity between the two instruments.
Carver not only followed Kreston impeccably but was also highlighted in the second movement, which began with a solo piano line, with a dark, intense sound escalating with the entrance of the violin melody. Each beat aligned perfectly between piano and violin, and this aspect of the performance was carried throughout the third movement.
After a short intermission, Carver, O’Neill, Kreston, Thornblade and Tsan took the stage to perform Robert Schumann’s “Piano Quintet.”
This was the highlight of the evening; with enthusiasm and variation, the five players stood out individually as they worked together. This quintet held the attention of all audience members throughout, prompting a standing ovation at the end. The second half of the concert flew by as the five players dramatically interacted with one another.
The piece also showcased Carver more than in any other of the night. Although the first movement began with the five instruments in unison, the exciting, fast-paced third movement, Scherzo, was carried by Carver’s technical ability, dramatic dynamics and body language.
Following the standing ovation, the group (excluding Thornblade) performed an encore piece, the Andante movement from the Brahms piano quartet in C minor. This piece ended the concert on a relaxing note; it was easy on the ears and just the right length for an encore. The smooth voicing and soulful playing pleased the crowd.
Although it was a little disappointing to not hear Carver perform a solo piece, she was absolutely the highlighted performer of the evening.
Correction: The print version of this story misidentified Lucinda Carver in the deck of the story.  This online version has been corrected to reflect the change. The Daily Trojan regrets the error.
Well, Vivien, I understand where you are coming from, but Mr. Eulert is within the right to be as put off as he is by this review.  Music, like science, mathematics, engineering, and architecture (to name a few) is a discipline.  With it being such, it is important that the author indicates an appropriate knowledge of how to talk about music intelligently, within the appropriate context, for the target audience.  Now considering that this review is in the ‘Daily Trojan’, it is quite likely that Ms. Gresko was not intending to make this entry of a calibur to be featured in a leading music journal, so I am not put off by her approach to use a more vernacular voice.  However, the fact that Ms. Gresko called all and any pieces “songs”, used “perform on a piece” (instead of “perform a piece”), and even mentioned ‘Top 40 hits’ indicates that she, at best, went too far in trying to cater to a mostly musically un-educated/trained collegiate audience or, at worst, was rediculously sloppy and careless in preparing her piece.  Had this review found its way into a published music journal of merit, comments like those of Mr. Eulert would seem lukewarm, perhaps even supportive in comparison to the scathing criticism she would deservedly receive from her music journalism colleagues and musicians themselves.
All in all, this is just a learning experience for a freshman music/journalism student who needs and will learn very much in her time here at USC.  Also, I think Eulert’s comments extend from a paranoia within the music community regarding the growth of ignorance and apathy towards all or many forms of ‘classical/art-music’; its practices, history, definitions, traditions etc. etc.  Given the overall, general decline of music education and exposure of ‘c/a music’, that we are witness to such a review only displays the effects of such holes in our curriculum, and to many musicians it is forboding as a chilling picture of music’s potential future.
Add that the review was written by a music student at a top-flight music school, and you can see how unhealthy the state of music may seem.
But as I said: I think and hope that this is just a roadbump and could be a formative learning experience if Ms. Gresko wishes to further her skills as a music-journalist.
I am disheartened by the negativity of these comments. The author of this article was clearly impressed and inspired by this recital, and while there may have been a few errors in her writing, the thoughts expressed above further divide the classical and mainstream audiences. We are still indulging and expressing an elitist attitude that defines classical music in the US.  Why can’t we just appreciate music for what it is….pure expression and joy for all and not get caught up in divisive symantics?
Oh, and it’s Dr. Carver…
I am probably going to sound like a snobby classical musician, but this article is probably the worst review of a classical music concert I have ever read. Full of incorrect details and nonsense, it sure was very popular today within the music buildings, sadly not for the quality of its content. For your information, Shelley Gresko, a song is a piece of music that features the human voice. You can refer to non vocal music as works or pieces. Not songs. I know we have a popular music degree now at USC, but music is not only songs or tunes. And these events are called concerts, not shows. Also, a pianist who performs with other instruments, or singers, is still called a pianist. Collaborative pianist is more appropriate. To my knowledge, there is no instrument called the accompano, we play the piano. Finally, we don’t perform on a piece, but we simply perform a piece. Oh, and also there is no Brahms “Violin Sonata Number 3”, if you look at the program, I’m pretty sure it’s written correctly: Sonata for Violin and Piano in G Major, Op. 78. Plus, that sonata is the first one of the set. So no Number 3 at all.
By commenting that the concert was appealing “also to those whose taste might not stray beyond Top 40 hits”, you are clearly pointing at yourself, and maybe in the future you should stick to reviewing that music style.
It was Brahms Violin Sonata No. 1, not No. 3.
Also, I don’t think O’Neill was particularly “violent”, as you say.  Perhaps you meant “violist” and your computed auto-corrected it.
Additionally, you should not refer to Dr. Carver as an “accompanist.”  Pianist, collaborator, musical partner… any of these are fine.  But she is not an “accompanist.”
Lastly, classical instrumental works are not referred to as “songs,” as it says in the picture caption.  They are “pieces.”

It’s not even the end of October, but I feel as if it’s time to start closing the book on 2010 and looking ahead to 2011. Yes, we’ve yet to see Darren Aronofsky’s Black Swan or the Coen brothers’ True Grit, but still, it’s never too early to look ahead.
In that vein, one of the most anticipated films for 2011 is The Rum Diary starring Johnny Depp. Shot in 2009, the release date has perpetually shifted many times, but 2011 seems to be the year. Based on Hunter S. Thompson’s first novel by the same title, it could surpass the fun-yet-overzealous drug-fueled romp that was Terry Gilliam’s Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas. One can only hope.
However, few people have heard of, much less read, Thompson’s debut novel, which was not published until 1998, almost 40 years after it was originally written. Regardless, The Rum Diary is one of those few pieces of literature that holds a special place in my heart.
Thompson is a paragon of late-20th century literature, and his works Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas, Fear and Loathing on the Campaign Trail ’72, and Hell’s Angels are standards for anyone aspiring to delve into the manic, crazed, combative and drug-fueled current that cut through the 1970s like the Gulf Stream.
He accomplished this by imprinting his views and quirks on his work. Thompson didn’t write stories so much as he lived them. He was the focus of his writing; the sole protagonist. He even coined a term for this style: Gonzo.
All writers are products of their own times, but Thompson was more so. He offered insight without perspective and tore down lies without building truth. He was a man who stood against much, yet stood for little.
His life was a quest for the American Dream, a quest that proved quixotic. He was a pessimist and a nihilist wrapped in the alluring, romantic cocoon of drugs, lust and violence. The force of his personality, and lifestyle — that is his legacy. But what is too often lost, not without justification, is Thompson’s innate brilliance as a wordsmith.
In no other work of Thompson’s is this talent more clearly evident than The Rum Diary. Thompson started writing it in 1959 at the tender age of 22. The book documents a year in the life of Paul Kemp, a  middle-aged reporter working for the Daily News, an English language newspaper in San Juan, Puerto Rico.
Kemp is both protagonist and narrator, easily recognizable as a toned-down Thompson prototype. He is manic and cynical, teetering on the brink of irrelevance; his world is closing in on him, but his vices are rum and women, not drugs.
Kemp is no Thompsonian hophead; rather, he is an introspective alcoholic struggling to find his place in life. In San Juan, he is happy. The money is good, the work is little and the times are fast in this 1950s boomtown.
But Kemp’s growing unease with his station in life and his desire to create news rather than report it leads him to the seedy underbelly of capitalism — where respectable businessmen are little more than crooks.
In The Rum Diary, modern critics see the origins of Thompson’s later genius and, thus, define the book in terms of his later excess. I disagree. The Rum Diary is not defined by excess but by restraint, and this is where Thompson’s true genius is found — a genius all too quickly snuffed by a mountain of drugs and alcohol.
We remember him as a vagrant, a social outcast who embodied the militant individualism of the ’70s, whose works allowed many to live vicariously through him, to bask in his reflected glory and dip their toes into the stormy waters of social unrest.
We do not remember him as a man who could capture the beauty of a tropical paradise and the ugliness of a slum, the eager anticipation of a young secretary poised for an adventure; and the obsessive lust of a desperate reporter.
Yes, a shot of Gonzo runs through the veins of The Rum Diary, but unlike his later work, it does not overwhelm the beauty of the prose. Too often when analyzing Thompson, we marvel at the grandiosity of his faults and ignore the ugly disillusionment from which they sprung.
The film adaptation might just be a faithful one. Director Bruce Robinson — the man behind the tragic comedy Withnail & I — is the perfect man for the job of adapting the story. He can bring the insanity, drama and humor of Thompson’s text to the screen without getting lost in delirium like Gilliam.
Depp has already brought Thompson’s protagonist to the silver screen, so there is no need to worry there. With the source material and Robinson’s less-surrealist direction, it should give Depp a chance to really show off his range.
The Rum Diary reveals a young writer perched on the precipice of greatness, ready to join the ranks of Ernest Hemingway, F. Scott Fitzgerald, James Joyce and Walt Whitman. He never found his story, however, and the small, burgeoning flame of talent was obscured by a drug-fueled fireball.
But his legacy lives on — in print and, once again, on film.

“This is not a polite recital. I want to hear you make some noise!”
Photo by Heather Lee 
That’s how Chris Sampson, director of the popular music performance program at USC’s Thornton School of Music, introduced the first band of the evening.
Although there was a bit of a chill outside on Wednesday evening, the performances by USC’s upperclass popular music performance majors made Ground Zero Performance Café the hottest place to be for this entirely student-run event; it also counted as the midterm for the class.
The only thing not extremely well done throughout the entire evening was the naming of the groups, un-creatively referred to as “Bands 1-5.” Although the names comically lacked any flair, the performances that spanned a solid hour and a half more than made up for it.
Kicking off the evening was band No. 1, which opened with Bill Withers’ “Use Me” to loud applause from the jam-packed Ground Zero seating area. The students provided grooving beats and soulful vocals to create an upbeat tone that permeated the evening.
As it transitioned into James Taylor’s “Mexico,” the tempo decreased but the quality grew even greater, accentuated nicely by the masterful harmonizing of all three vocalists. It finished its set with the funk classic, “Long Train Running” by the Doobie Brothers, which received raucous applause from the audience as the band left the stage.
There was no time to dwell on the previous performance, however, because band No. 2 came on shortly after, opening with the edgy “Barracuda” by Heart before slowing things down with an impeccable cover of Elton John’s “Goodbye Yellow Brick Road.”
The best vocal performance of the evening came during the group’s  last song, a rendition of “Stay With Me” by Rod Stewart’s band Faces.
Band No. 3 started off its set in a more somber fashion with David Bowie’s “Life on Mars?,” a track that showcased the tempo of the musicians. Then, it chose to also play Faces’ “Stay With Me,” providing a slightly different take on the tune that pleased the audience, which was unfazed that it had already heard the song in the previous set.
The band members’ best performance was their own energetic rendition of “Long Train Running” in which they truly proved their mastery as musical artists.
Band No. 4 opened with a unique rendition of the previously played “Barracuda,” before playing a spot-on cover of Randy Newman’s “I’ll Be Home.” It closed gracefully with “Life On Mars?” and was once again able to keep it fresh.
The night’s closing act, band No. 5 — a nine-piece group featuring two guitarists, a bassist, a drummer, a violinist, two saxophone players, a trumpet player and a keyboardist — put on the best performance of the evening.
The group opened its set with authority to the tune of Jeff Beck’s instrumental track “Hammerhead,” which incited head-bobbing throughout the entire venue. Its second song was a cover of Steely Dan’s “Peg,” which showcased the talent of every band member, especially with impressive guitar and saxophone solos. It felt as if there was a big, old-time jazz band onstage jamming out, and the crowd responded enthusiastically.
Now, it was time for the final song of the evening. The band members invited up three guest vocalists to join them as they performed a rousing rendition of Earth, Wind & Fire’s “Dancing in September.”
It was the perfect ending to the night, as the good vibes and energy reverberated off of the walls of Ground Zero long after the band left
the stage.
USC Thornton School of Music’s popular music performance program is renowned for a reason, and that reason became clear Wednesday evening. The classic songs that these students performed are by no means easy, and this mini-concert was a testament to all that the popular music performance majors have accomplished thus far and an indication of their potential.
Of course, Wednesday was only one-half of the showcase, as the second part will take place tonight at 8 p.m. at Ground Zero. This time, the first-year students get to show off their stuff, and it will be truly exciting to see just what they can bring to the table.
If Wednesday was any indication, Friday’s showcase is not something to be missed.

First, there were the chairs.
The steady metastasizing of the white folding chairs across Alumni Park and back toward Tommy Trojan was the most unmistakable herald of the biggest party USC will see all year.
The swearing in of C.L. Max Nikias as USC’s 11th president is bringing more than 10,000 students, staff, alumni and members of the Los Angeles community together to celebrate a new era for the university.
The arrival of President Barack Obama on campus on Oct. 22 is the first indication of just how prestigious that era will be. With two inspiring presidents speaking on campus within two weeks of each other, students need to sit up and take notice of the new legacy they are stepping into.
Nikias is a leader who emphasizes character. As president, he will push students to strive for the breadth and depth on which the university prides.
But most notably of all, Nikias will be a president that students have access to. The interest he takes in USC’s student body is not borne solely from the fact that he has two students of his own enrolled here. It stems from the deep and abiding interest he has always taken in the school.
For the first time ever, students not going home for Thanksgiving this fall will be invited to the president’s home in San Marino for dinner. It was also Nikias’ idea to hold afternoon teas with students who want to speak with him. It was he who pioneered Visions and Voices, donated McClintock Theatre and began spearheading the plans for a new health center.
And it is Nikias who students see holding up his “Fight On” sign on the sidelines of the football games.
Students at the inauguration Friday will be watching a man who they might often have seen, without realizing it, walking across campus every day just as they do. Students should be at the edges of their folding seats listening to what he has to say.
Come Friday evening, the chairs will quietly disappear.  What will remain on campus is Nikias’ innovation, his unique presence as a leader and his unflagging loyalty to the students of USC.
“With two inspiring presidents speaking on campus…”
But one is a great leader, much more accomplished, actually produced impressive results, and has a great vision…and I am talking about President Nikias.

Many of us view college as nothing more than a means to get good jobs after we graduate. But why not jumpstart that process? Turns out we don’t have to wait until after graduation — and the crushing pressure of repaying our student loans — to try to make our fortune.
Julia Vann | Daily Trojan
More and more college students are succeeding in creating their own business ventures years ahead of graduation, while still holed up in the hallowed halls of their universities.
The most obvious college start-up example, recently immortalized in film, should be sufficient inspiration. But this article is neither about Facebook nor the Facebook movie; instead, it concerns the plethora of other entrepreneurs who create innovative businesses from their dorm room. The famed social networking site is a great testament to the potential upside of college entrepreneurship, but it’s a statistically improbable home run — more than most of us can expect.
Nevertheless, the possibilities for entrepreneurship are boundless; they don’t need to involve engineering breakthroughs.
Aspiring journalists, for instance, now have all the tools they need to make a mark on the changing world of print media. Mediashift, a PBS-affiliated website that tracks the radical changes in journalism, features examples of journalists riding the wave of transition from traditional media to digital journalism.
The site recently featured undergraduate Zephyr Basine, who created the blog-turned-website CollegeFashion.net. Bored with her biology seminar at the University of Massachusetts Amherst, she decided to scout fashion while in class, and feature or improve the fashions she observed.
Mediashift reports that “Basine is part of a select group of students who have constructed worthwhile new media niches — and become stars — while still in school.”
Another Internet startup, HackCollege.com was founded in August 2006 by Kelly Sutton, who at the time was a 19-year-old student at Loyola Marymount University.
Mediashift reports, “Kelly Sutton … began without a plan. [He] enjoyed reading the popular productivity blog Lifehacker and simply thought, ‘Hey, there needs to be a Lifehacker for college students, and I’m going to do that.’” HackCollege brought Sutton publicity, internships and job offers. His isn’t the only success story.
At USC too, students are hard at work with their entrepreneurial activities. Ben Gordon, a sophomore majoring in business administration, began the Bicycle Bread Company, which makes and sells a wide variety of bread on campus. His niche is a delivery service and attentive personal relationships with his customers.
Derek Roth, a senior majoring in public policy, planning, and management, and David Rajewski, a sophomore majoring in business administration, run their own longboard retail companies — Initiative Skate and Stoked Skateboards, respectively.
These three Trojans might not expect their businesses to become the next Facebook, but the startups provide good real-world experience and much-needed financial padding.
One of the nine businesses recently featured in Inc. magazine’s “9 Cool College Start-ups” is College Weekenders, pioneered by David Wachtel of USC. College Weekenders had its start with — you guessed it — the Weekender to Northern California.
Wachtel realized he could get a good price if he organized a trip package with a hotel and bus company, which he marketed to his fellow Trojans. Inc. magazine reports that Wachtel intends to extend College Weekenders to other college campuses in the future.
USC has many resources to encourage, support and develop innovation. The USC Stevens Institute for Innovation was founded in 2004 to promote and incubate innovation at USC among the faculty and students.
The Stevens Institute also sponsors the USC Student Innovator Showcase and Competition each year to encourage and reward innovation in the student body.
USC is a vast and diverse marketplace of experts, innovators and creators, who, through some networking, might be available to help you move your own plan forward.
If you have an idea that you think deserves a leg up, there is no better time to go for it. As Trojans, we are taught to lead and make our mark by transforming the world in which we live.
Unlike the generations that preceded us, who saw graduation as the starting line, our starting gun might have sounded the day we arrived at USC.
Reid Roman is a sophomore majoring in industrial and systems engineering. His column, “Bright Side,” runs every other Friday.
Nice article but seriously, dont give people over-inflated expectations.  9 OUT OF 10 NEW BUSINESSES FAIL!!!!  This statistic is no different for USC students and grads.  Yes, i advocate trying, but also being realistic and viewing your business as a learning experience to help you try again in the future and increase your chance for success.  I have seen many people put all their hopes on a venture only to have them crushed.  We never talk about the failure stories.  
USC is obsessed with unrealistic success stories.  But there is just as much to be learned from those who have tried failed, because 90% of the time, that will be you.  This article is fodder and ignores reality.  Dont post crap like this anymore without being a little more realistic.  There is no entrepreneurship fairy .
It appears to me that Joe is quite angry that there is no Entrepreneurship Fairy.  Joe, what have you written lately?  Where can I read what you have written?  Where I see what you have been doing to further mankind in general and the USC students in particular?  
Lastly Joe, Mr Roman’s article is on the Editorial page of the paper.  While you could possibly have some valid points were this article not on the Editorial page – IT’S ON THE EDITORIAL PAGE!  
Seriously Joe, it is not a rhetorical question – Where will I find the work that you are doing?
You are absolutely right. But the pessimism and bitterness isn’t called for. Hell yeah the economy sucks. I graduated this past May, and a few of my classmates whom I still keep in touch with don’t have jobs related to their majors, nor are they making “average college grad pay.” It blows! But am I bitter? somewhat. But I don’t blame the DT’s “unrealistically optimistic” stories. 
There is an article in the LA times recently, about a USC Marshall grad who ran short on his luck; his folks’ clothing business almost fell into bankruptcy; but he turned it around; and now he’s really successful…He runs a high end jean company. It’s one of those expensive, Diesel, Lucky brandesque jeans that cost like $250+ per set. But I just remember he was quoted, “don’t be afraid to fail.”
This is an inspiring and timely article about college entrepenuership.  With unemployment rates in the five digits, many college students might well need to develop those type of survival skills.  May I suggest three simple questions that one should ask themselves as they start their own venture:  1) Who are my customers 2) Why will they want to purchase my products and services (instead of the products and services of my competitors)…. this could also be asked as what is unique about my product or service (compared to the products and services of my competitors)  3) How will I fund the operation during the startup process.
Good Luck to all those daring enough to venture forth.  
Reid, I enjoyed the research and examples that you provided of college students who have decided to launch their own businesses.  Thanks again for the inspiration and reflection on this topic.
“Many of us view college as nothing more than a means to get good jobs after we graduate,” this is because college conditions you to think a certain way. The academics, for the most part, condition you to approach things mechanically. Both mechanical-heuristics (college academics) and creativity are the keys to success.

Accused of not doing enough to prevent people from buying cold medicines to make the drug methamphetamine, CVS/Pharmacy will pay $75 million to settle a federal case, according to the Los Angeles Times.
The case argued that CVS did not properly safeguard cold medicine with pseudoephedrine, a common ingredient in over-the-counter medications such as Sudafed and Claritan, as a nasal congestant.
“This case shows what happens when companies fail to follow their ethical and legal responsibilities,” said U.S. Atty. André Birotte Jr. in a statement. “CVS knew it had a duty to prevent methamphetamine trafficking, but it failed to take steps to control the sale of a regulated drug used by methamphetamine cooks as an essential ingredient for their poisonous stew.”
Federal prosecutors brought the case against the giant drugstore chain, accusing the stores of fueling meth trade in California and other states. The prosecutors said CVS violated the Combat Methamphetamine Epidemic Act of 2005, which limits cold medicine purchases.
“We are announcing today that we have resolved this issue, which unfortunately resulted from a breakdown in CVS/pharmacy’s normally high management and oversight standards,” Thomas M. Ryan, chairman and CEO of CVS Caremark, said in a statement. “While this lapse occurred in 2007 and 2008 and has been addressed, it was an unacceptable breach of the company’s policies and was totally inconsistent with our values. CVS/pharmacy is unwavering in its support of the measures taken by the federal government and the states to prevent drug abuse.”

Despite a misleading announcement last month that the Downtown Art Walk would be discontinued for the remainder of this year, the ever-growing event will resume its monthly madness tonight.
Jay Lopez, the Art Walk’s former executive director, posted a message a few weeks ago on the event’s official website saying it was canceled through January and would continue in the new year as a quarterly event, according to the Los Angeles Times. Although other board members did acknowledge that there was talk of canceling the event, they said they never discussed turning it into a quarterly event.
The future of the event was in question because of a shortage in the funding needed for security, trash collection and other services required for such a large gathering.  The Times estimated that around 20,000 people attend the Art Walk each month.  Though it is wildly popular among patrons, not everyone in the art community supports the event.
“[The galleries] aren’t interested in doing an event where there are 20,000 drunk kids,” Bert Green of Bert Green Fine Art told the Times. “The galleries have to do what’s in their own interest, which is to focus the event back to art.”
Green is involved with the organization of a newer, decidedly daytime art walk, one of many art walks that have been popping up all over Los Angeles in the past few years.
Its future still under debate, the success of tonight’s Downtown Art Walk could play a large role in determining what is to come for the art-loving, food-filled event.

Men’s basketball coach Kevin O’Neill discussed the oft-mentioned topic of sanctions with the Los Angeles Times Wednesday, saying the self-imposed sanctions helped his team in the long run because as a result, the NCAA did not further sanction the basketball program.
Had heavier sanctions come down, O’Neill said, the recruiting ramifications would have devastated the team. The team lost five commits from last year.
“I’m glad we self-imposed,” the Times reported O’Neill saying Wednesday at a coaches luncheon. “I think it played in our favor. Had we not, I think we’d have lost another recruiting class, and if you lose two in a row you’re basically dead in the water.”
That’s not the case, however, and O’Neill pointed to the strength of his roster, specifically the new players.
Incoming freshmen Maurice Jones, Bryce Jones, Curtis Washington and Garrett Jackson, and Fordham transfer Jio Fontan are expected to make an immediate impact on the team, which opens its season with an Oct. 23 scrimmage at the Galen Center. The first non-exhibition game will be on Nov. 13 against UC Irvine, also at the Galen Center.

University officials have confirmed that President Barack Obama will visit USC on Oct. 22.
Obama will make public remarks at McCarthy Quad at 1:30 p.m. that Friday in an event hosted by the USC Political Student Assembly, according to university spokesman James Grant.
Whispers of the visit originated earlier this week, but today they were verified.
Though there has not been word from the White House, the Los Angeles Times cited an unnamed source within the Democratic National Committee  confirming that the president will “headline a rally” on campus that  afternoon.
The Times reported that the president is expected to appear with U.S. Sen. Barbara Boxer, the California incumbent who is  locked in a tight race with former Hewlett-Packard chief Carly Fiorina.  The Times has also reported that Democratic gubernatorial  candidate Jerry Brown is expected to attend the USC rally but not  campaign individually with the president.
Grant confirmed the Democratic National Campaign has rented space on campus for a fundraiser for Boxer, but specified that it was a separate event from the McCarthy Quad rally and the the university was not providing any money for the fundraiser.
Wow, first made boy Pat Haden runs Indymac Bank into the second largest fiasco in US history and then made boy Obama runs the united States of America into the ground. What are you boys going to do now? “IWe’re going to USC, and then Riordan’s Pantry for some chicken and waffles”
I call him by his middle name “Hussein”.
Very exciting.  I managed to stop by the Clinton rally and was thoroughly impressed by the turnout, though somewhat ill at ease in enemy territory.  I don’t agree with many of this President’s policies, but I am nevertheless thrilled to hear that he has chosen to stop by SC.  Let’s hope he uses the opportunity to speak about the issues that will matter most to Californians this November when we take to the polls.
Only thing I’m going to comment on is how everyone refers to him as Obama. Even the DT refers to him as Obama. When you get elected as President you should always be referred to as President so and so. Clearly, if Barbara Boxer were elected President she would make people call her that name :)
Tyler, I agree with your comment.  I have noticed that our President is not addressed as President Obama & it bothers me because it shows lack of respect.
I also have noticed that a lot of people refer to him simply as “Obama” as well and try to correct myself because it is so common.  In the case of the article, in the first sentence he is referred to as “President Barack Obama”.  From then on in the article it is completely it is proper to refer to him as simply “Obama”.
Oh… you mean the way everyone always referred, with great respect, to President Bush?
I was an undergrad at USC when President Ford spoke on campus, where I had the opportunity to shake his hand and speak to him.  It was one of the highlights of my life, even though I was not a fan of his politics.  
If you don’t realize how significant Obama’s visit is to USC, please don’t share your hate.  Stay classy, Trojans.
It maybe an honor for a University to host a U.S. President regardless of whether the University community agrees or disagrees with his policies.  But to take part in a rally for Boxer or Brown.  Now, that’s a different story.  A University should be a neutral ground for students.  Politicians should not use the University’s property to rally his/her party.  What about hosting a future Presidential debate at USC in 2012?
I’m an alumna and currently live in San Francisco but I will be coming down to see this. What an amazing honor to have him on campus two times in the last five years! I was on his national campaign staff, along with Hillary’s, and I still get a kick out of seeing him speak, especially in the Quad where I had so many great memories. 
Republicans, I can respect that you have a different point of view, but have some respect. The vast majority of the country voted him in, which is much more than you can say about W, considering he didn’t win the popular vote.  He’s laboring and struggling to undo all the damage W did, so let’s cut him a break.
And you think the vast majority know what they are doing?  Give him a break?  He was suppose to be ready for the job on day one, remember?  If an administration keeps blaming the previous administration(s) for the mess, nothing will get done…and that’s what we are seeing.
This is just a pile of nonsense. Most of the damage Obama’s dealing with involves situations he has made worse, not better. However big the majority that elected him (and it really wasn’t “vast”) — a majority of THOSE folks are now wishing they hadn’t. You’ll most likely see exactly what I mean come November.
Not sure it’s big honor to have the worst president in U.S. history show up on campus. I wish he HAD gone to UCLA. He’s both arrogant and incompetent — what’s to celebrate?
You clearly need to study US history if you think he’s the worst president in our history. 
Curious how an “incompetent” president could help pass health care reform that insures 30M+ people, usher through a financial reform package, sign a nuclear reduction treaty with Russia, end the war in Iraq, allow stem cell research in the US, expand rights for Gays and Lesbians, win the Nobel Peace prize, raise the perception of the US abroad, appoint two women to the Supreme Court (one of whom was of a minority never before represented therein), prevent an economic depression, etc, etc… Did I mention preventing Sarah Palin from being anywhere near the Oval Office?
Well, Gabriel, when you grow up and start having to pay your way in the world, you will understand why passing health care “reform” is going to drive the already shaky economy completely into the toilet. FAIL. His financial “reform” utterly fails to address the heart of the real problems on Wall Street (a bunch of folks who love his policies, by the way, as evidenced by their overwhelming support for Dems instead of GOP). FAIL. He signed a nuclear reduction treaty with Russia? What? The Cold War is over? Hey Gabriel, ever hear of President Reagan? Good grief. Another FAIL. End the war in Iraq? It’s over? FAIL. Allow stem cell research in the U.S. at the cost of innocent human life? FAIL. Expand rights for gays? Have to admit haven’t seen a lot of this yet, but I think the gay community more or less considers it a FAIL so far. Win the Nobel Peace Prize? That was the biggest joke ever as commentators on all sides agreed. P.S. He hasn’t promoted peace anywhere. FAIL. He’s absolutely damaged relationships with allies and enemies all over the world, but if that’s your idea of “raising” the perception of the U.S. abroad… FAIL. He’s appointed two women to the Supreme Court? Only a liberal would think that it is an accomplishment in and of itself to promote someone on the basis of gender or race. FAIL. Prevent an economic depression? Looked at the unemployment figures, my friend? Good luck getting a job when you leave the cushioned environment you now enjoy. FAIL. Snide comments about Palin? Witty and clever on your part! I’ve never heard anything like that before.
FAIL.
He’s the worst president ever, as history will bear out. He’s arrogant, thin-skinned and incompetent. Gabriel honey, when the NY Times starts to say things like that, you know Obama’s in trouble.
Diane, quit being an angry ignorant person; if your going to be one go to University of Idaho forums.  Who started this financial rut? the republicans; what is obama doing? trying to fix it as best he could.  The republicans offered NO solution to anything.  Why is it that statistically speaking people that hate Obama lack a college degree? it’s because they’re too lazy to actually get up off their butts and figure out whats really swirling around before them.  So before you say anything and blame the economy on Obama, read a book
God you really take the cake for being a moron.  I don’t care what president is coming, a presidents arrival to the University will give it credibility and increase East Coast/world knowledge of the school.  The more prestigious the school is, the better the student body.  if you can’t respect our commander-in-chief maybe you need to move out of this country–it would increase the average intelligence of America as a whole
Anyone organizing a protest?
I’m a proud Democrat, former president of the USC College Democrats 00-02 and let me say many of those dim-witted kids from behind the red curtain in OC couldn’t even get a job working for me!
Must have been and still be lonely
ATO loves Obama!
Can we just go to McCarthy? No tickets required?
Pike #1
hahahaahah YESSS PIke NUMER ONE!!
Getting to see the President of the United States from your college dorm window? Only a few can dream of that! Guess I’ll be the lucky one! 
Really excited about this. 
Suzanne ’85, get over yourself and grow up. Hosting the President of the United States (be it Curious Georgie or Obama) should be an honor for any University. Be glad that he chose USC and not UCLA or UCI or any of the other campuses.
He won’t be walking by your dorm window you fool!
Can you like, fill in that chip on your shoulder? No need to burst someone else’s bubble.
If he/she lives in Birnkrant they’ll be able to see him in McCarthy Quad, Einstein.
Another fool!  They don’t let the president walk around where people can see him from windows.  That’s how Kennedy got shot.   They actually lock people out of buildings where they can control the windows.  Haven’t you ever seen a movie?
Well as a 1999 alum I’m ecstatic. Can’t wait. Is it Friday yet?
This is amazing. I can only hope he’ll be at The Lab grabbing an IPA after the speech…
Congratulations to PSA and Program Board for making this amazing event happen!!!
I am hoping Obama stays around long enough to take part in our daily 4:20 celebration in New North
I’m in!  Spark one for Change!
Not many people get to say that the current president visited their college when they were students. On that note, I’ll say that I am quite excited for next Friday.
As an alum, I’m both disappointed and disgusted.
Someone’s bitter her party lost and went insane…
Ah, so you’ll be one of those fascists who populated the school along with dim-witted legacy kids from Orange County back in the days when we were nowhere in the national rankings.
Oh, and for the record, the correct term is alumna if you’re female, alumnus if you’re male. Alum is a chemical compound.
Get a job, pay taxes, then comment Mike…most of the so-called dim-witted kids from Orange County that you so openly loathe will soon be your boss.  Better tone down your rhetoric kid
Let’s be real here, it’s very apparent which kids got into the school because their parents are high-paying alumni. Many of those kids are from Orange County. And most of those kids are in fact dim-witted. If you want to drive the country back into the ditch W made, by all means, vote Republican. I’m kind of liking the progress Obama is making, despite the Reds voting against literally anything he proposes. Advice: don’t bitch about lack of progress when it’s the Republicans’ temper tantrums that are halting the progress.
Karen,
I did, I do and I did. I’m an alumnus, in my 30s and I’ve spent 9 years in a military uniform. The only people who get to call me kid these days are my septuagenarian parents.
I’m ashamed and disgusted that Suzanne ’85 went to USC.  I suppose SC didn’t have high admission standards 25 years ago though.
As an alum, I’m both disappointed and disgusted!
The event will be held at McCarthy Quad. I don’t think you need tickets for this event.
Great, another chance to praise the great Obama.
How do we get to attend this? Are there tickets? Is it invite-only?

The Pac-10 Conference is reportedly nearing a decision on how to divide the conference into two six-team divisions next year, when Colorado and Utah will join the conference to create the Pac-12.
Conference athletic directors discussed possible configurations during a meeting in San Francisco last week, and Pac-10 Commissioner Larry Scott said he hopes to have a final decision made by Oct. 21, when the league’s presidents and chancellors will meet.
Under the current scheduling format in both basketball and football, the teams play each other in a round-robin format. Each football team plays the other once, and each basketball team plays other teams twice — once away and once at home.
The issue is that Pac-10 football currently has no conference championship game. This will most likely change with the addition of Colorado and Utah, as the 12 teams will be split into two divisions, with the winner of each meeting in a conference championship game.
The question that remains is how it should be done.
One option is the so-called “zipper” format, in which each geographic rivalry would be split into separate divisions ­— USC split from UCLA, Stanford from Cal, Arizona from Arizona St. and so on. However, each team would still play a nine-game schedule, which would include two or three conference games out of their division — one against its rival.
Another solution is a North-South split, in which the Pacific Northwest schools would create one division and the Southern California and Arizona schools the other.
The issue is whether to put the Northern California schools or the conference newcomers in the South. If Stanford and Cal were put with the Southern schools, it would isolate the Northern Division from recruiting-rich California. However, if the Bay Area schools are placed in the north, they would lose their annual rivalry games with USC and UCLA, and therefore the media revenue and exposure gained from playing in the Los Angeles market.
Either way, the winner of each division would face each other in a conference championship game, presumably at a neutral site, although Scott did say that the conference is exploring having the school with a better record or standing host the championship.
However, should USC lose its appeal to the NCAA regarding its program sanctions, it would not be able to participate in the championship game until 2012.
In basketball, the conference wants to keep its 18-game conference set-up. In order to do this, teams will play their geographic rivals along with six other teams in a home-and-home format, meaning one game would be played at each school. They would then play one game against the other four conference teams; two at home and two on the road. That would ensure that all conference teams play each other at least once during the season, but not all in a home-and-home set-up.
The conference tournament in basketball would invite all 12 teams and remain at the Staples Center until 2012.
The conference currently has a television contract with Fox Sports Net, but will most likely open up television negotiations next year.
NO. NO. NO.
The North/South split MUST happen.
The Weekender is ESSENTIAL. Anyone who does not think so must not have raged their faces off last weekend. 
WE CANNOT LOSE THE WEEKENDER

A USC professor has been recognized by the International Research Promotion Council for his work with cancer and the human papillomavirus.
W. Martin Kast, who teaches molecular microbiology, obstetrics and immunology at the Keck School of Medicine, won the Millennium Golden International Award and was named the 2010 Eminent Scientist of the Year and North American Immunologist of the Year.
Man of the year - Professor Martin Kast receives the Eminent Scientist of the Year award for his research in human papillomavirus. - Dieuwertje Kast | Daily Trojan
“From my undergraduate through now, I have always had interest in and worked on projects having to do with antiviral immunity,” Kast said.  “In the future I plan to translate our laboratory findings into clinical trials and perform these trials with a team of physicians on the medical campus.”
Knowledge about HPV can be used in researching other cancers as well, he said, such as prostate cancer and melanoma. Hopefully, Kast added, the publicity of his award will result in more opportunities for his work.
“The award shows that the international research community is appreciative of the work that I am doing in this area and sees the potential of treating woman with this deadly disease in underdeveloped countries,” Kast said. “This will also bring very positive publicity which might lead to funding agencies and more grants to help the research efforts.”
More than 500,000 women worldwide are diagnosed with cervical cancer each year, but according to Kast, cervical cancer is completely preventable in developed countries through vaccination.
Underdeveloped countries, however, are not able to afford this vaccine, often resulting in death for women with cervical cancer. Kast’s research is aimed at assisting women after they are diagnosed.
“Therapeutic vaccines work after the fact that you have a virus or cancer and it tries to manipulate your body and stimulate the immune system so it can fight the infection,” Kast said.  “My research is helpful in giving treatment to cervical cancer after it has infected the body.”
Some of Kast’s research focuses on learning how HPV enters the immune system, gets into the cells and escapes from the system, and how to reverse the escape.
Kast’s 11-member research team has also contributed greatly to this project, he said.
“They physically carry out the experiments and intellectually attend meetings and develop new ideas to see if they can be used in our research,” Kast said.
Diane Da Silva, a senior research associate who has worked with Kast for 12 years, said he is very passionate about his work and research.
“What is great about Dr. Kast is that he injects his enthusiasm he has for the research into his staff, and gives us independence to develop new ideas and test our hypothesis,” Da Silva said.  “He really cares for all of his students and team members and wants all of us to do our very best and succeed as independent scientists.”
Lisa Yan, a second-year graduate student studying genetic, molecular and cellular biology, said Kast’s mentorship has been invaluable during her time in his lab.
“There are often times when Dr. Kast would question me until I am speechless, allowing me to realize how much more I have to learn to become an expert in this field,” she said. “His comments and intellectual input into my research has opened my eyes to different aspects of my work. This contribution is priceless.”

Soapbox: Is the current state of a tailgating on campus a problem?
The university has established additional tailgating regulations in response to an increase of alcohol-related incidents this semester, university officials said.
Party foul · Students tailgate on McCarthy Quad on game day. The university has instituted new tailgating policies concerning drinking. - Heather Lee | Daily Trojan 
Since Oct. 1, the office of the senior vice president of administration issued a document containing new and existing rules that all students, alumni and visitors must abide by on campus on game day, said Capt. David Carlisle of the Department of Public Safety.
“What is driving this issue is this semester. We’ve had a record number of alcohol-related incidents and transports to hospitals,” Carlisle said. “We want people to be responsible.”
One of the primary new regulations this semester, Carlisle said, is the prohibition of drinking games, including activities, such as beer pong and “beer jeopardy.”
“The drinking games just lead to drinking too much and if you’ve got all day to drink, it could be a problem,” said Todd Dickey, senior vice president of administration, who said evening games create increased opportunities for people to consume more alcohol, which leads to problems.
Another main provision that will change tailgating on campus is a ban on loud music after receiving complaints from tailgaters and visitors, Dickey said.
“We’ve seen some very large DJ booths turn out with very loud, amplified sounds,” Dickey said. “We think having music at your tailgate is fine, and having TVs at your tailgate is perfectly fine, but having music that you can hear from a block away is not OK.”
DPS will be responsible for enforcing tailgating rules on campus; however, public safety officers plan to maintain a low profile this year since many people are unaware of the new rules, Carlisle said.
“It’s going to take a few games for people to understand what the rules are,” Carlisle said.
DPS officers began to inform tailgaters of the new rules during the  Oct. 2 University of Washington game by walking around campus handing out yellow fliers to tailgaters who were not obeying rules, Carlisle said.
“We let them know that this is now going to be against USC campus rules,” Carlisle said. “Generally they were understanding and cooperative, but there were a few who weren’t happy … the change is for the benefit of everyone.”
Dickey said he believes there won’t be any problems this weekend because of the early game time of 12:30 p.m. for Saturday’s game.
“We want [campus] to be a family-oriented tailgating experience,” Dickey said. “It’s not going to be heavy-handed implementation. It’s going to be reminding people that we want tailgating to be a good experience for everyone.”
If tailgaters do not follow the rules once informed by DPS officers, students might be cited and referred to Student Judicial Affairs and visitors to campus might be asked to leave campus, which is allowed because the university is private property, Carlisle said.
“We’re all Trojans,” Carlisle said. “In order to maintain an atmosphere that everyone can enjoy, there have got to be some rules imposed.”
And yet, Carlisle said he is pleased to see so few incidents for the large number of people on campus on game days.
“For the number of people we have on campus — students, visitors — overall, people are generally really well-behaved, but there’s always that small group who overindulge,” Carlisle said. “When you drink alcohol, you do foolish things, and when you do foolish things, you get yourself hurt.”
Prohibiting beer games and amplified music are the newest regulations the university will focus on enforcing, Carlisle said, other rules against prohibited activities — failing to discard trash  properly in receptacles, disruptive behavior, using open flame without having a fire extinguisher nearby, driving tent poles or stakes into the ground — must still be followed.
“These kinds of rules have always been in place,” Dickey said. “It’s just nice to have a policy that we can point to … people are usually really good if you just go up to them and remind them; they’re always cooperative.”
What about those guys in the costumes that go around playing instruments? There must be hundreds of them! Has someone talked to them?  I can’t hear my Dean Martin records when they come by.  And what about after November 2nd?  I suppose the university is going to ban Pot Pong then!
Interesting Reading…
This started at the coliseum last year. They handed out memos with a list of restrictions…
No DJ equipment, works for me. I don’t have a DJ. The music was loud but I never complain.
The excessive drunkedness is not really necessary. Banning games is probably not the solution.
No private Port-A-Potties. Why NOT? We take our families and I don’t want my kids stepping on a pile of crap each time.
Someone that Tailgates regularly should offer to sit in on these regulation panels… That way, it makes sense.
The last game was pretty empty at the coliseum. Is that what SC wants? Less fans coming to the games?
Lets just hope for a good season and Party On!!!
I seriously doubt there was a rise in alcohol related incidents because the attendance at tailgates and games has been paltry compared to previous years.  The quality of the team might be the reason for excessive drinking instead of drinking games. Can we ban a bad football team DPS?
Noise abatement is understandable, but really, how do other people drinking a lot really affect me? Some people are jerks sober, so are we going to ban them from campus as well because tangentially it might affect my experience?
I’ve been tailgating at USC for a number years now. I have walked over to campus and have first hand seen and heard the loud music along with the drinking games. I agree with the decision to ban drinking games. There are enough Alumni, students and fans drinking already do we really need to encourage drinking games too?? USC is only looking out for the safety of the fans and students. Football tailgates should be about supporting your team not getting drunk. All to many times I’ve seen people passed out, sick or being taken to hospital by medical services. If students are not careful drinking will be prohibited altogether. Explain to me why you need to be drunk to see the game?? I can understand having a few drinks with friends and bbq. But the purpose of drinking games is to get drunk in a short amount of time. I think some need to reevaluate the reasons why they attend tailgates in the first place. Are you coming to get drunk or are you coming to celebrate and support your team?? 
Don’t get me wrong I’ve packed the cooler with beer and gone to the games. BUT I have never gotten so drunk that I don’t remember or passed out at the games. I think we all just need to calm down and be thankful tailgating hasn’t been prohibited. Students should remember they are their for an education not to be playing drinking games.
Ok, gang complain if you will but this is the warning… I’ve been to many campus pregames where no alcohol is allowed unless confined to some cage, (Uof A)…I guarantee one and all,,,if this friendly reminder isn’t noticed,,, the fun lamp really will be put out…. Case in point… in San Diego…’cause a bunch of drunk idiots caused a small tussle on the beach… a beach booze ban is now in effect from the border to parts unknown somewhere to the north… why, ’cause a bunch of jerks couldn’t control themselves.. now,,,nothing but tea and crumpets…
So instead of people’s drinking being prolonged over the day while playing drinking games, people will just.. be drinking.. all day. Your logic escapes me, USC.
WHAT? People have to be less-drunk/sober during the game?? We’re all doomed! I don’t go to games for the spirit or the team. I go to get my drink on beforehand which I obviously cannot do at other events, at the bar, or with my friends. Everything I do, every event I attend must have alcohol present, and I must consume it excessively. DESPAIRRRRR.
Beer jeopardy does not exist. Criticize a drinking game that actually exists
Why are they trying to suck all the fun out of this University?!
Now they forgot to mention that public safety was only bothering certain people. Now they are banning port o potties. What they failed to figure out was alot of fellows are going to be urinatinating all over the place as they do not provide enough portopotties. What is going to happen is the coliseum is going to start smelling like pee-pee &  doo-doo
They forgot to mention that we aren’t allowed to rent our personal porta potties any more.  They expect us to use the very few they have in various locations (gross).  We should ask the DPS officers to use them @ 6:00 clock on a 7:30 game day.
Uhoh. Supposedly, people have been getting hurt playing this “football” thing I’ve heard so much about. Better ban it…just to be safe.
I agree, What is going to happen is the fellows are going to start urinating & some all over the place and and the coliseum is going to start smelling like pee-pee & doo-doo, Great job L.A. The DPS officers made them be removed last game but yet they used them before they were loaded on the truck. I think a class action suit is in order as removing them is just inhuman.
This will have the same teeth as when DPS yells “Walk your bike please!”
Drink On!
Does this mean they are going to cancel drinking games at Traddies as well? Or does the “New” Traddies not allow that kind of barbaric fun?
Can’t take credit for this but @BigSoCalRay had a great idea on Twitter: “Every time a patrol comes by, we all take a shot!”
I think this is a perfectly reasonable request.
Take your children to Disneyland and your soft liver to UCLA.
I’m looking for the “like” button.
HAHA!! Serious!!
There are no transports from tailgating… The reasoning from the university does not make sense at all. All that “beer games” do is get people excited about the game.
Beer jeopardy?  Did the university just make up their own drinking game and then ban it?
(like)
Although I can see where they’re coming from with the accidents, it doesn’t make sense to remove all drinking games. What do students do at tailgates? Eat, Drink, and Play Games. Tailgating is all about getting excited for the game… they have an hour or two before the game to enjoy getting amped and have fun. The campus is a safe and controlled environment to do these things, now you’re just forcing people to drink outside and then make their way to the stadium which includes crossing many roads (or even driving) and dramatically increases the potential amount of accidents…
Don’t think they thought it through and just want to have an illusion of security for anyone visiting the campus.
As with all of these “campus restrictions” there will be loopholes galore. Anyone up for some water pong with a beer in their hand?
((like))
Well I think stopping drinking games isn’t really going to fix too much. Though thank you for stepping up for the loud and annoying music! That was getting quite agitating.
This is ridiculous. The alcohol related incidents that have happened this year were not at all related to tailgating. I have never heard anybody complain about the atmosphere on campus during game day tailgates. If anything, that’s the majority of current students’ and alumnae’s favorite part of game day. These rules, although from my understanding of the article are not supposed to be heavily mandated, are a complete damper on the Trojan spirit that so many have come to this school for and learned to love.
Drinking on campus keeps people in check much more so than pre-gaming off-campus.  It is not “unclassy” to play drinking games.  This is will ruin the campus atmosphere for many people, both students and alumni, and I’m sure USC will see a decline in both football attendance and the number of people tailgating on campus.
There really seems to be no basis for these rules.  In one part of the article, Carlisle said that “We’ve had a record number of alcohol-related incidents and transports to hospitals.” In another part, he states that “he is pleased to see so few incidents for the large number of people on campus on game days.”  So we’re being punished for a few isolated incidents? And when were the transports?  If they’re referring to the recent problems on Greek Row, that is completely separate from tailgates on campus.
Thank you for pointing out this blatant contradiction — “a record number of alcohol related incidents” and “so few incidents for the large number of people on campus” .  Though I wonder if the author brings up this contradiction unwittingly, without consideration of the message the article seems to convey, or if the author is purposefully bringing to light how misguided this endeavor really is.  To sacrifice an entire avenue of entertainment to spite “that small group who overindulge(s)” is by no means a fair or just course of action.  Katharine
Harrington, Senior Vice President of Administration, I understand your stance, and appreciate your consideration for your student body’s well being, but this blanketed reaction is not the end-all solution.
I think these rules are absolutely reasonable. They aren’t banning alcohol all together. Keep it classy ‘SC.
Alex Frank and Alumni,
Are you really concerned that you won’t be able to play Beer Pong or pretend to be a club DJ?  Get a life, these are completely reasonable restrictions.

Fans of Valencia, a five-piece pop/rock band from Philadelphia, know the group for its upbeat melodies and soaring choruses. Its latest release sees Shane Henderson (vocals), Daniel Pawlovich (drums), JD Perry (guitar), George Ciukurescu (bass) and Brendan Walter (guitar) stepping outside of their comfort zone both lyrically and musically in an impressive fashion.

Their signature pop/punk/Americana sound remains intact, but are supplemented by new R&B, blues, country and Mexican rock influences quite masterfully throughout the album.
Kicking things off is the record’s title track, “Dancing With A Ghost,” which features the trademark clean guitars of Walter and Perry and a beat sure to get hands clapping. The song starts the album off right with its sing-along chorus and thoughtful lyrics.
The next track, “Spinning Out” features slower, more melodic verses bolstered by Henderson’s soulful vocal delivery in the powerful chorus. Throughout the song, he sings lyrics that include I feel like I’m in over my head / I just always self-destruct / I guess I’m blinded by the sudden loss of love.
“Still Need You Around (Lost Without You)” is a somber, touching offering that packs one of the greatest punches on the record. It is at this point where Valencia starts reinventing itself and where the album really takes off.
Normally a slow song would feel out of place this early in a record, but it actually works here. Accompanied throughout by a violin, the song builds up in epic fashion in the bridge as the band members come together to provide emotional vocals about trying to grapple with the mortality of their parents and how difficult life would be without them.
Up next is “Consider Me Dead,” another new direction for Valencia. It is the hardest song in its repertoire, complete with guttural screams in the background of the bridge, and although it is slightly repetitive, it still provides an enjoyable listen.
“Losing Sleep” sees palm-muted guitars in the verses that give way to an absolutely soaring chorus as Henderson sings, You know I won’t give up without a fight / Even if I’m the one who’s wrong and you’re who’s right.
Perhaps the most interesting song on the record is track six, “Friday Night.” It opens with a classical orchestra before transitioning seamlessly into a down-and-dirty rock ‘n’ roll guitar riff that demands attention. The verses carry a bluesy vibe to them and the chorus is sure to get people moving.
Valencia then drops the tempo with the next offering, “Somewhere I Belong,” a track where an orchestral theme backs Henderson as he softly sings lines such as, My life has always been a dead-end street / With heavy eyes that shoot through me. Complimented by a female vocalist by the name of Simon Wilcox, the harmonies here are nothing short of beautiful.
Following such a stunner is no easy task, and “Days Go By” seems to come up short in comparison to the previous track. Although it is good as a stand-alone track with its bouncy verses and catchy chorus, it just simply does not have an impact like its predecessor. The folk feel that it takes on in the bridge, though, is quite intriguing and consequently begs for the entire song to be replayed.
The last two tracks on the record close it out in dramatic fashion. “The Way” has a bit of a country twang in its guitar riff while featuring an upbeat, memorable chorus reminiscent of Valencia’s previous release, We All Need a Reason to Believe.
The closer, “Stop Searching,” is perhaps the best song Valencia has ever written. The guitar riff is utterly infectious while the pounding drums and Henderson’s vocals in the verses create a Mexican-rock vibe. The chorus features Valencia’s first endeavor into double-time drumming, also known as the “punk beat,” and the song is full of hooks and energy exemplified by group vocals. The vocals are also top-notch, with Henderson belting out lines such as, Did I speak too soon about the elephant in the room / I’d survive with or without you but what would that prove?
All in all, Dancing with a Ghost is an intriguing listen that sees a band knowing its signature sound, but reworking it tirelessly to turn a good album into an excellent one.
Although the flow seems a little off between the two ballads and their subsequent tracks, the album as a whole is quite cohesive, and it begs to be listened to as a whole as opposed to skipping around.
Simply put, Valencia know how to make good music, and Dancing with a Ghost provides thunderous support to that claim.

“I will never forget the first time I paid a player.”
Not alone · The NCAA hit USC hard with sanctions involving Reggie Bush’s relationship with an agent, but former NFL agent Josh Luchs says in a report that he personally paid dozens of college football athletes. - Daily Trojan file photo 
These are the words of former NFL agent Josh Luchs printed in a special Sports Illustrated report released on its website Tuesday. Luchs, who was a NFL agent for 20 years, alleges that he knows of 30 collegiate football players who took cash or extra benefits while still in school, most of which were provided by him in the 1990s.
Of those 30 people, four were USC players, including receiver R. Jay Soward. You might recognize Soward’s name from various recaps over the weekend as freshman receiver Robert Woods came dangerously close to Soward’s school record of 260 receiving yards in a game. Soward told SI that Luchs’ statements about their interactions is true and he took the money because his scholarship didn’t give him enough money for rent or food. He said he would do it again if he had the chance.
Although this report deals with transgressions that happened 10-20 years ago, it still has a major effect on college athletics today. It confirms what many people currently believe: that player-agent monetary relationships have been and still are very prevalent at many institutions around the country, not just at USC.
But it also indirectly confirms another truth USC fans have widely believed. The NCAA was trying to make a point with the sanctions handed down to USC over the summer.
Before I go on, it must be noted that USC isn’t the first institution to be punished by the NCAA — far from it. Over the years, some schools have received just as harsh — if not harsher — punishments as the Trojans.
Southern Methodist University, which was a football powerhouse in the ‘60s, ‘70s and ‘80s, had its football season cancelled for two years (the NCAA gave it the option to play only road games in 1988 but the school declined) as a result of findings that a booster paid the players via the athletic department.
Then there was Miami in the mid-’90s, which was put on a one-year bowl ban and lost dozens of scholarships for manipulating the system in order to get hundreds of thousands of extra dollars in Pell Grant money and financial aid.
Alabama received stricter penalties in 2002 when it received a two-year bowl ban and also lost scholarships because boosters gave five-figure payments to a few high school coaches in order to lure recruits.
Finally, there was Indiana basketball in 2008, which was put on probation for three years in addition to self-imposed scholarship reductions when it was found to have major recruiting violations.
However, although these penalties are arguably harsher, these schools didn’t get punished because an agent paid a player in hopes of landing him after he left school. All payments came via boosters or inside men to entice athletes to stay at that school. There were a lot more cases of NCAA rule-breaking by schools during this time, but they mostly dealt with academic fraud, recruiting violations and the like.
USC is the first case of a school receiving major penalties because of illegal activity regarding agent-player relations. But as the SI report shows, this activity has been going on for at least 20 years, most likely longer.
Even though it’s been happening for so long, there hasn’t been a notable penalty until the one levied on USC. That’s partly because of inconsistencies in laws throughout the various states, but also because it’s extremely hard to prove. It took the NCAA four years to finally come out with the sanctions against USC.
With all this in mind, it’s clear the NCAA is trying to make an example out of USC. Just look at the current college football landscape. Since the sanctions were handed down at USC, North Carolina’s football team has become the subject of a major NCAA probe looking into player-agent relations that has already had a few players dismissed or suspended from the team. Florida’s Maurkice Pouncey is alleged to have taken $100,000 from an agent before last year’s Sugar Bowl. Alabama and South Carolina are also on the NCAA’s radar regarding player-agent misconduct.
USC was clearly not the only school where such improprieties were occurring. But the NCAA is hoping to show that the USC sanctions, will hopefully curb the practice. It’s hoping for a response similar to the one given by John Lombardi, the president of the University of Florida when SMU received its penalty in the late ‘80s.
“SMU taught the committee that the death penalty is too much like the nuclear bomb. It’s like what happened after we dropped the (atom) bomb in World War II. The results were so catastrophic that now we’ll do anything to avoid dropping another one.”
Sadly, this problem might be too widespread — Luchs was just one unknown guy among possibly hundreds doing this — and so deep that the NCAA will have trouble keeping tabs on everyone. All the NCAA can do is hope stiff sanctions are enough to scare schools straight.

“But it also indirectly confirms another truth USC fans have widely believed. The NCAA was trying to make a point with the sanctions handed down to USC over the summer.”
I don’t see the connection Kenny.  It seemed pretty clear to me before you wrote your article about somebody else’s article.  If you cheat, you are going to get punished for it.  Would the realization have come sooner if Reggie had invited you to a house warming party?
Hey kenny, good spittin
This frustrates me so much. Why don’t these a-hole agents get any punishment? They know very well that what they are doing is illegal by NCAA rules, yet they do it any ways. And who gets punished, the players and the schools, including the other players that were abiding by the rules. If the NCAA wants to crack down on illegal payment of athletes, go after these scumbag agents!
