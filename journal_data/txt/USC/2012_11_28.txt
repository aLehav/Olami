Stefan Biedermann, a deputy consul at Germany’s Los Angeles Consulate, voiced his personal opinions on the history and current state of the European Union during a conversation Wednesday in the Social Sciences Building.
The event, sponsored by the School of International Relations and the International Relations Undergraduate Association, featured Biedermann, a native of Bavaria who has served as a diplomat for 19 years, as the main speaker. Biedermann offered students a rare inside look at the world of international politics.

The European Union is currently facing a severe debt crisis exacerbated by ugly political infighting — a topic he did not shy away from.
Biedermann, however, thinks the negativity surrounding the European Union hides the positive impact it has had on the world up to this point, telling stories of his grandfather who grew up in a very different Europe than the one today.
“My grandfather … grew up in a [Germany] that was very much influenced by nationalism [and] in school, he was taught that France was an eternal foe,” Biedermann said. “‘The French are our eternal foe. We are better than them,’ he was told.”
Up to that point, Biedermann said Germany had only achieved unification by waging wars on neighbors.
“If you look at European history, [Germany has] had one war after the other,” he said.
After World War II, however, the majority of European countries agreed that the violence had to end — one reason the European Union was born. Though Biedermann said the EU is not perfect, he said it has transformed Europe into a completely different entity than what it was when Biedermann’s grandfather was growing up.
“If you look at my grandfather, within his lifetime there were two wars against France. But at the end of his life the borders between Germany and France have completely disappeared,” Biedermann said. “I would call that a miracle.”
Biedermann also pointed to the impending admission of Croatia to the EU as a sign of good things to come.
According to Biedermann, much of the negative press about the European Union has to do with a lack of perspective from the younger generation.
“The new generation … doesn’t know the price we have paid to get rid of borders. … The generations that went to war know how important it is to have the European Union,” Biedermann said.
Still, Biedermann said the EU is still a work in progress that will have to deal with many upcoming challenges, including the reemergence of nationalist thinking among certain European communities.
“We have to be very vigilant so that we don’t fall back into the old nationalist ideas we had before,” Biedermann said.

At 10 a.m. on Wednesday, a group of anxious college students was huddled outside a basement classroom in Mudd Hall. They were wearing black robes resembling graduation gowns and holding a red gift bag and an old-looking boombox.
Tapped · The Mortar Board recognized Adlai Wertman, a professor of clinical management and organization, with a tapping ceremony Tuesday. – Arya Harsono | Daily Trojan
These five students represented a portion of the university’s Mortar Board, which promotes and recognizes academic excellence at the university.
One girl, not in a black robe, took the boombox and ran into the classroom. The group of black-robed students huddled together and one exclaimed excitedly that this will be the first “tapping” he will ever take part in.
The group lined up as last-minute students darted into the classroom. They giggled as they passed the strange outfits of the Mortar Board members.
“We look like Dementors,” one of the students said.
Outside the classroom, the USC fight song rang out. It’s show time. The black robes waltzed into the classroom and stood in a line at the front, while the non-robed girl, Angeli Agrawal, turned off the music and stood up to read a speech.
Agrawal had nominated Adlai Wertman, a professor of clinical management and organization, to be recognized by Mortar Board through a tapping ceremony, which is designed to be a surprise for the professor.
Wertman put on his glasses and looked puzzled to the front of the classroom. He sat down and looked forward.
He had no idea that he was this semester’s Mortar Board honoree. In fact, his first thought was that the group of students was presenting an assignment that all students were scheduled to present.
“And then I noticed that none of these students are in the class,” he said.
Wertman is no ordinary professor. Before coming to USC, he spent 18 years working on Wall Street. Wertman then left Wall Street to run a homeless agency on Skid Row and spent seven years as president and CEO of Chrysalis, a non profit in Los Angeles solely devoted to helping the homeless find employment.
Wertman said he wants to encourage business students to make a difference.
“Students who went to business school weren’t looking at careers in social enterprises, and people who wanted a career focused on helping others weren’t going to business school,” Wertman said.
Wertman said USC was a good fit for motivating students to make a difference because of support from Marshall School of Business Dean James Ellis and the inclination USC students have to make a difference.
“USC students naturally feel that they have a responsibility and role in society after graduation,” Wertman said.
At USC, he founded the Society and Business Lab at Marshall — an organization dedicated to teaching students the importance of business from a social reform perspective.
According to Wertman, everything he has accomplished in life — or just about — can be attributed to his good fortune.
“I was born in the United States. I was born with parents who prioritized education. And I was born with an innate ability to learn and an ability to communicate,” he said. “The only thing I added to that was hard work.”
As a result, Wertman felt it didn’t seem fair to just worry about maximizing income.
“I felt it was my responsibility to use those gifts to help people who weren’t born as lucky as I was,” he said.
For Wertman, receiving the Mortar Board honor confirmed that he’s doing his job and accomplishing his goals.
“Since my goal is to teach and inspire students, I am really honored by being told that my students are acknowledging that I’m doing my job [and inspiring them],” Wertman said.

SpaceX Chief Financial Officer Bret Johnsen joined other SpaceX executives Wednesday to give a presentation to students about the commercial space travel company. SpaceX became the first private company in May 2012 to send a spacecraft to the international space station.
Aspirations · Bret Johnsen, chief financial officer of SpaceX, explains what it takes to pursue a career in the aerospace industry to a student audience at an event held Wednesday. – Priyanka Patel | Daily Trojan
Johnsen spoke at a recruiting event in Mudd Hall hosted by the Trojan Scholars Society and PlushMoney, an organization focused on empowering women in the workplace. After the presentation, students had the opportunity to network with Johnsen, who majored in accounting as an undergraduate at USC, and other executives.
“This type of event is very unique to USC because I haven’t done any at any other campus,” Johnsen said. “I’m a firm believer in the Trojan Family, so for me, it’s one of the ways I can give back to the university that was such an unbelievable supporter of me and my education as well as my career.”
Given the nature of SpaceX’s work, Johnsen said it isn’t hard to sell the company to students.
“It’s not hard to find exciting things about SpaceX,” Johnsen said. “I would say the most exciting [thing] by far, though, is standing there with 1,000 of your fellow employees and watching a successful launch. There’s nothing really like that that I have experienced in my whole business career before. The thrill of it is awesome.”
In addition to presenting facts and figures about SpaceX, Johnsen and his colleagues explained the different career opportunities that are available at the company, which can be found on its website.
“We have an unbelievable hiring ramp going right now,” Johnsen said. “We’re local, we’re probably one of the most exciting — if not the most exciting -— companies going on in Southern California and we’re hiring in all areas, so I would say my advice is to get the resume over right away.”
Johnsen said after having the support of the Trojan Family throughout his career, it is nice to be in a position to give back through hiring.
“I’ve been able to hire more Trojans than anybody else in both of my previous jobs and at SpaceX as well, so it’s fun to give back in that regard,” Johnsen said.

Students rallied to raise awareness about human trafficking in a Wednesday night event near Tommy Trojan put on by World Vision ACTS, a student organization dedicated to raising awareness about social injustices.
Demonstration · Students Ester Lee, Chloe Kwan and Kaytee Canfield add their handprint to show their solidarity for the fight against human trafficking at an World Vision ACTS rally held Wednesday at Tommy Trojan. – Maddy Campion | Daily Trojan
Adam Joe, World Vision ACTS co-president and a sophomore majoring in film production, delivered a speech to kick off the rally, which featured activities and poster boards encouraging student engagement and discussion of injustices associated with human trafficking.
“We will not accept slavery,” Joe said. “Our generation is rising up as the next abolitionists of our time.”
Joe said human trafficking is a worldwide issue and exists in many forms, including child soldiers and sex slaves.
According to World Vision ACTS co-president Michelle Lau, a sophomore majoring in business administration, 27 million people are currently enslaved worldwide, making human trafficking the third-largest crime in the world.
Lau said that students have the power to affect social injustices, such as human trafficking. World Vision ACTS uses “creative activism” to address social issues on a global scale, according to Lau.
“As students at USC and in America, we enjoy a democratic system and a privileged country. We should voice our opinions about these issues because our society has the means to make a difference,” Lau said. “Creative activism allows the issue to become tangible for people and take action. They have to interact and feel engaged in the cause.”
Joy Elise, a sophomore majoring in graphic design and cognitive science, submitted her art addressing the issue of human trafficking to the organizers, who displayed it at the event. Organizers also put up informational display boards that encouraged attendees to guess how many slaves exist globally and compare the prices of everyday items in a dorm room to the monetary value associated with child slaves.
World Vision ACTS member Mo Alabi, a sophomore majoring in print and digital journalism, said the organization emphasizes spreading awareness for various causes, such as AIDS, famine and malaria, in unique ways.
“We’re really focused on putting the message out there in a way that’s creative and sticks with people,” Alabi said. “Everything we do is student driven and designed by us. The dedication of the [leaders and members of the club] is amazing.”
Club members read aloud stories of children around the world who have been affected by human trafficking and encouraged students passing by to show their solidarity for the cause by painting their handprint onto a banner.
Lesley Chan, a sophomore majoring in chemical engineering, stopped to look at the posters at the event as she was walking down Trousdale Parkway. Chan said that the information she learned about human trafficking at the event inspired her to learn more about the issue.
“I just heard a story about a girl in California who was forced into prostitution. I was really surprised that, even in our own country, human trafficking is happening,” Chan said.

USC sophomore wide receiver Marqise Lee was the recipient of two major accolades Wednesday, as he was named a first team All-American by the American Football Coaches Association and a finalist for the 2012 Walter Camp Player of the Year Award.
New York, New York · Marqise Lee’s nomination for the Walter Camp Award bodes well for his chances of becoming a Heisman finalist. – Carlo Acenas | Daily Trojan
Lee joins Kansas State senior quarterback Collin Klein, Texas A&M freshman quarterback Johnny Manziel, Oregon senior running back Kenjon Barner and Notre Dame senior linebacker Manti Te’o as a Walter Camp Award finalist. He finished the 2012 regular season with 1,680 receiving yards and 14 total touchdowns. He also led the Football Bowl Subdivision with 112 receptions (a Pac-12 record) and was third in all-purpose yards at 215.7 per game. The winner of the award will be announced on Dec. 6 on ESPN’s SportsCenter.
Last year’s Walter Camp recipient was Stanford’s Andrew Luck, now a quarterback for the Indianapolis Colts. The award was first given out in 1967 to USC alum O.J. Simpson, who won it in back-to-back years. Charles White, Marcus Allen, Matt Leinart and Reggie Bush were also winners representing the Trojans.
Four of the five finalists last season ended up with invites to New York as candidates for the Heisman Trophy. Announcements regarding this year’s Heisman, however, have yet to be made. The award ceremony is set for Dec. 8.
Meanwhile, the American Football Coaches Association voted Lee to the All-American team alongside Baylor wide receiver Terrence Williams. Five other Pac-12 players were named —Oregon’s Barner, Stanford tight end Zach Ertz and offensive lineman David Yankey, Oregon State defensive back Jordan Poyer and Arizona State defensive end Will Sutton. Former Trojan and current Georgia Bulldogs linebacker Jarvis Jones also qualified for the team. Interestingly, current Heisman frontrunner Johnny Manziel did not earn the quarterback slot, which instead went to Clemson’s Tajh Boyd. In total, the SEC led all conferences with eight players selected to the team. Last season, no Trojans were selected.
Lee also recently earned the title of the 2012 Pac-12 Offensive Player of the Year for his performance this season, but his list of accomplishments might soon grow larger — he remains a finalist for the 2012 Biletnikoff Award, given annually to the best wide receiver in the county. Lee  appears to be the frontrunner after being the only wide receiver named to the Walter Camp list. Last year, junior wide receiver Robert Woods was named a finalist for the Biletnikoff, which ultimately went to Oklahoma State’s Justin Blackmon. Blackmon won the award two years in a row and now plays for the Jacksonville Jaguars. A Trojan has never won the honor since its inception in 1994.
The Associated Press All-American team remains to be seen as well, and wasn’t released until Dec. 14 last season. Woods was a member of the first team, as was former left tackle Matt Kalil. Then-junior Matt Barkley was named to the third team.
Great and well-deserved honors for Marquis Lee.

The whispers started with USC’s loss to Stanford in mid-September.
They grew louder after the shocking upset loss at Arizona in late October.
Hot seat · Given Kiffin’s inability to deliver on the Trojans’ lofty preseason expectations, his name will certainly appear on hot seat lists to begin 2013. – Carlo Acenas | Daily Trojan
When USC Athletic Director Pat Haden indicated before the Notre Dame game that Kiffin would be retained for next season, no matter the result of the looming matchup versus the Fighting Irish, the decision was met with moans and groans.
By the time Notre Dame’s defense stopped USC’s offense within mere feet of paydirt for the second time in seven minutes, fans had been screaming for USC coach Lane Kiffin to be fired for weeks.
But is that really the right move?
Let’s not forget that just last year, we were heaping praises on Kiffin for guiding a program wrecked by probation to a top-five ranking while successfully developing senior quarterback Matt Barkley into a superstar.
This season, USC still averaged 34.2 points and 451.9 yards per game, only a minute decline from last year’s marks of 35.8 points and 456.8 yards.
So what happened?
Well, for starters, Barkley threw for a career-worst 15 interceptions. Whether you want to blame that on poor decision-making by Barkley or poor protection by the offensive line, neither of those reasons can truly be pinned on Kiffin.
Many people are faulting Kiffin for running the ball over and over at the goal line against Notre Dame — but a closer look at the plays that were called reveals that wasn’t even Kiffin’s preferred plan of attack.
On USC’s final two scoring chances in the fourth quarter, the Trojans ran nine plays inside the 5-yard line: five rushes and four passes.
Three pass attempts to Lee resulted in an incompletion and consecutive pass interference penalties on the Fighting Irish. It was clear that Notre Dame wasn’t going to let Lee beat them.
After the penalties gave USC first and goal on the 1-yard line, Kiffin attempted to let his offensive line pave the way for Max Wittek on a sneak. Twice, they failed. Senior running back Curtis McNeal didn’t get anywhere on third down, either.
On fourth down, Kiffin called for a play action pass that left redshirt freshman fullback Soma Vainuku wide open. The play call worked.
But Wittek’s pass was slightly low, and Vainuku couldn’t hang on. Game over.
The cold, hard truth that most USC fans can’t seem to accept is that the players simply didn’t execute on the goal line. Not the offensive line, not the running backs, not Wittek — nobody.
If a team is on the 1-yard line and can’t punch it in on three consecutive running plays, that is not the coach’s fault. The team probably doesn’t deserve to win in the first place.
Some people say  Kiffin should have referred to Notre Dame’s game plan against Stanford, when they stuffed the Cardinal’s rushing attempts on a similar goal-line stand.
But any sane coach would not call for a pass play on first or second down when his team is inches away from scoring, especially when his quarterback is making his first career start and has already thrown two interceptions, one of which went directly into the hands of the best defensive player in college football.
With limited room to work, there’s simply too much risk for a game-ending pick.
Truth is, throughout the season, the Trojans’ problems materialized on the defensive side of the ball. Some say Kiffin is too one-dimensional to be a head coach — but can you blame him for focusing on offense when he has two supposed defensive gurus in Monte Kiffin and Ed Orgeron on his staff?
Now, obviously, the elder Kiffin’s Cover 2 scheme hasn’t worked out in three years at Troy, and likely never will. In USC’s five losses this season, the Trojans ceded an average 500 yards per game and gave up the most points (62), touchdowns (nine) and yards (730) in school history in the loss to Oregon.
Any and all calls for Monte Kiffin’s dismissal are warranted, as there are plenty of defensive coordinators out there that could do better.
But can we say that any of the head coach candidates out there could have done an overall better job — especially with recruiting — and shown as much passion for the USC program as Lane Kiffin has over the last three years?
Though this season was arguably the most disappointing in school history, let’s remember that last year’s campaign was one of the most inspiring, from the 38-35 upset of Oregon to the 50-0 throttling of the Bruins.
And despite the frustration that USC fans harbor over this season, the Trojans still have the expected No. 1 recruiting class in the country waiting in the wings.
I say the man responsible for that deserves one more chance.
 
“Chin Music” runs every other Thursday. If you would like to comment on this story, visit DailyTrojan.com or email Will at wlaws@usc.edu.
USC was never a # 1 team.  Preseason ranking mean absolutely nothing.  You have been on probation, and probation hurts any and all programs.  You are only special in your spoiled minds.  I remember an era where no one wore USC hats, shirts, etc.  Remember Paul Hacket & Larry Smith???  Now you face a 6 & 7 team from the ACC who will run for 500+ yards against you.  Final score:  GEORGIA TECH  45    USC  24.  After this game you will be calling again for the head of your coach.  The truth is your program is descending because UCLA has an emerging  program, therefore you will no longer have the pick of the litter.
Dude, you’re seriously stupid. I guarantee Georgia Tech will run for no more than 140 yards on USC. And why are you commenting on an article from the USC student run newspaper?
Pick of the litter? Did you read the article? Have you seen USC’s recruiting class(es)? They are ridiculously good. UCLA does not have better classes than USC nor better current players. That’s just false.
A few numbers to consider when talking about whether or not USC is special:
Heisman Winners: 7 (compared to GA Tech’s zero)
National Titles: 11 (compared to GA Tech’s 4)
Conference Titles: 38 (compared to GA Tech’s 16 in the ACC, an objectively inferior football conference to the PAC-10/PAC-12)
Now, Paul, I’m not sure where you went to college, but I am sure it is a university not nearly as amazing and wonderful as USC.
You talk about Heisman, where was he a coach?  USC?  Negative.  By the way GT was in the SE conference for many, many years.  Want to compare academics?  No ballroom dancing classes at GT nor other ACC schools.
Tech will run rings around your goons.
I’m a retired nuclear engineer, where do you think I went to school, USC?
paul you got issues dude……move to another site….:)
Since when was the DT open for old bags to spur nonsense?
We are USC and we want GREAT! We want results and we want someone who strives for the best.
Kiffin can go and learn and grow as a coach to se smaller school and take his time.
Lane Kiffin is patently dishonest.  He lied before the season started about voting USC #1 in the polls.  And does any sane person really believe that the ball boy underinflated the Oregon footballs during the game on his own?  He is not a man of integrity.  He needs to leave.
I think the true evaluation of the job Coach Kiffin is doing should not be based soley on one goal line stand in the Notre Dame game, but on evaluating the season as a whole. Did the team improve from week to week? Were they better at the end of the season than they were at the start of the season? Did the team have a clear identity? The answer is obviously NO! Having a clear understanding of a game plan, playing with effort and energy, protecting the ball and not making stupid penalties does not take talent or experience it takes good coaching and good preparation. None of which were a consistent part of the USC football program this season. If it were then they  would have improved from week to week and over the course of the entire season. If it were they would have been able to execute from the one yard line against Notre Dame and we would not be reading this article. Pat Haden says he sees the potential. But, players don’t go to USC because the coach has potential. Alumni don’t support the program because the coach has potential. Fans don’t support the team because the coach has potential. This is USC and you expect the best!
I like many Life Long USC Football fans are numb after being ranked No.1 at the start of this season to ?
After so many sad & numbing loses. It feels like when Texas ran over us in the Bowl game! Do you remember that?
It just does not make any sense to have All American Football players on our team and not be able to put it all together & gel, to create a close family type bond with all of them. 
I can bet you the house that A.D. Pat Haden &  J.K. McKay have been working on getting someone with Pete Carrol skills on motivation to mentor these kids as that is what this program needs now! Call it what you will
Hand holding or Rebuilding its all the same!
Everything falls into place. It’s like going to work everyday, ether you like it or you don’t. I love what I do!
I personally know in my heart that USC Football will make a come back. 1-Coach & Many Players at a time.
FIGHT ON!!
Just Like My Nephew Anthony Contreras would be saying if he were still around!!
Kiffin’s speciality is play calling–and he is horrible at it. But, more imprtantly, he has no connection to the players during the game–he buries his head in his play sheet and rarely comes out of it. Plain and simple, he is not a leader the team seems to want to follow–they don’t play for him. Next year will be more of the same and then…
Lane Kiffin is just two young and inexperienced to make decisions in stressful times. His Dad is too old, and they both need to go somewhere else. Dad retire, Lane, coach at a middle tier school- learn some things, make the middle tier school grow and succeed with that supposed great recruiting he does. Then 10 years from now, come to a top tier school and coach from what he has learned.
Awaiting your responses to the below
“This season, USC still averaged 34.2 points and 451.9 yards per game, only a minute decline from last year’s marks of 35.8 points and 456.8 yards.”
-Last year we went 10-2.  This year we went 7-5.  Alabama only averaged 432 yards a game – is Saban a worse coach than Kiffin?  Clearly, stats don’t mean much and are not a defense for Kiffin.  
“Three pass attempts to Lee resulted in an incompletion and consecutive pass interference penalties on the Fighting Irish. It was clear that Notre Dame wasn’t going to let Lee beat them.”
-You’re telling me it’s crazy to expect your coach to have planned for a scenario where the opponent does everything possible to stop your best receiver in the red zone, other than switching to obvious runs up the middle?
“The cold, hard truth that most USC fans can’t seem to accept is that the players simply didn’t execute on the goal line. Not the offensive line, not the running backs, not Wittek — nobody.”
-Passes to the FB lost us the game against Stanford and UCLA, and played a big part in the game against UA.  I don’t see how having a backup QB in the game increases the chances of an already proven failure of a play.
“If a team is on the 1-yard line and can’t punch it in on three consecutive running plays, that is not the coach’s fault. The team probably doesn’t deserve to win in the first place.”
-If a team does that on one drive, fine.  You went conservative, ran totally unimaginative plays without recognizing that the defense was running such a simple play even ABC’s hacks could point it out for you.  Pick up 3 points, we’re still in position to win the game.  The NEXT drive though, you do the exact same thing?  And with horrible clock management?  If a COACH does that (and here we know Kiffin is the culprit as he obviously won’t let anyone else call plays and spends the majority of the game staring at his playsheet), you DO deserve to lose, forget about winning.
“Some people say  Kiffin should have referred to Notre Dame’s game plan against Stanford, when they stuffed the Cardinal’s rushing attempts on a similar goal-line stand.”
-Those people would be misguided…
…because Kiffin actions suggest he can’t be bothered to watch film.  Or that he can’t retain anything he watches.
“But any sane coach would not call for a pass play on first or second down when his team is inches away from scoring, especially when his quarterback is making his first career start and has already thrown two interceptions, one of which went directly into the hands of the best defensive player in college football.”
-This is called playing not to lose.  Yes, it’s risky to throw with a backup QB making his first start who has already made mistakes.  But it’s downright stupid to run into the heart of ND’s defense.  Why would you trust your O line, which has failed you time and time again this season (including the drive right before), when ND has a DT the size of two of our linemen, a group of LBers headed by a Heisman candidate, and knowledge that you are most likely going to run it up the middle cuz you’re too afraid and too uninspired to do anything else?
Let’s not forget that the boys DID execute.  Twice.  Once on a Wittek sneak and once on the curl to Lee, and BOTH TIMES the TDs were revoked because Kiff did his idiotic run down the sideline to call a timeout just before the snapp.  That’s 12 (14) points that should’ve been there had it not been for bad decisions by the Head Coach.  Difference in the game.
Kiffin’s offense SHOULD have performed well this year. How could it have not with pre-season Heisman frontrunner Barkely throwing to Woods, Lee, and two highly talented tight ends? Add the addition of Redd to McNeal’s solid 2011 season and one quickly realizes that our offense actually posted disappointing numbers this year. Not only did the offense underperform but playcalling was suspect the whole season, not just on the goal line against Notre Dame. 
As head coach, it is also Lane’s job to be an effective manager of his assistant coaches. The Tampa 2 was horrendous in 2010. It didn’t work well in 2011. And our defense was flat out embarrassing this season considering the vast amount of talent we had on the field. Sure, we were thin at some positions but that’s no excuse for consistently getting torched on 3rd & long and for our secondary looking clueless more often than not. Lane deserves to be fired if he chooses not to fire his dad before next season. USC football has turned into the defensive University of Swiss Cheese. Ridiculous. 
I admire your support of our team, Will, but this season made it clear that Lane is a poor motivator, ineffective manager, and lacks the innovation necessary to win football games in the second half. I’ll give it to the guy though, he can recruit with the best of them.
I don’t know about you, but the only thing “inspiring” to me is winning. Winning Rose Bowls and National Championships.
What’s the point of a #1 recruiting class if you can’t manage talent? Do you remember that we were ranked #1 before the season started? This was the most disappointing season not only in school history, but also in COLLEGE FOOTBALL HISTORY. 
You don’t deserve a second chance after that.

Point: USC’s forgiving Pac-12 and non-conference schedule will allow the team to work out its kinks.
After last season’s 50-0 demolition of UCLA put the finishing touches on a 10-2 campaign, there was plenty of optimism heading into the offseason.
Visions of Matt Barkley, Robert Woods and Marqise Lee danced in the heads of USC fans, and some wondered if purchasing tickets to Miami for January’s national championship ahead of time would be a good bet.
Even though there is a completely different atmosphere surrounding the program following USC coach Lane Kiffin’s third season at Troy, next year the Trojans should easily improve upon the 7-5 record they posted this year that have many members of the Trojan Family calling for Kiffin to be fired.
Even if Kiffin doesn’t return next season, which seems unlikely after Athletic Director Pat Haden confirmed to the media before the loss to Notre Dame that Kiffin would be back next year, the Trojans have the pieces in place to compete for a spot in the Rose Bowl.
It’s true: USC has six big pieces graduating in Barkley, safety TJ McDonald, tailback Curtis McNeal, center Khaled Holmes, defensive end Wes Horton and safety Jawanza Starling.
But depending on which, if any, juniors declare early for the NFL Draft, those six seniors, along with punter Kyle Negrete, could be the only starters not to return next year.
A year ago, it seemed to be a sure thing that wide receiver Robert Woods would jump to the pros after his junior season. But after a season of being overshadowed by Lee, that decision is no longer a foregone conclusion, especially after redshirt freshman quarterback Max Wittek effectively spread out the touches between the two flankers against the Fighting Irish.
Junior running back Silas Redd is a perplexing case, but having a season in USC’s backfield without McNeal stealing the spotlight would surely help his draft stock.
Cornerback Nickell Robey, a three-year starter, could make the jump as well, but will a player whose measurables are 5-foot-8 and 165 pounds really garner enough draft interest to leave college a year early?
There’s no doubt the defense needs a makeover, and some have speculated that assistant head coach for defense Monte Kiffin, 72, will be gently forced into retirement by his son.
After all, it’s hard to argue that a lack of talent was the defense’s problem.
Junior defensive end Morgan Breslin (12 sacks) and freshman defensive tackle Leonard Williams, who was recently named the Pac-12 Freshman Defensive Player of the Year after recording 7.5 sacks and 13 tackles for loss this season, emerged as forces in the trenches.
Senior defensive end Devon Kennard (18 career starts, four sacks) redshirted this season after tearing his pectoral muscle in late July, and will be back for one more year.
Sophomore linebackers Hayes Pullard (91 tackles) and Dion Bailey (75 tackles, four interceptions) will continue to be stalwarts in the middle.
And in case you forgot, USC expects to welcome the No. 1 recruiting class in the nation to Los Angeles next year.
But perhaps the biggest reason for optimism lies not in the Trojans, but in their opponents on tap for next season.
For the first time since the Pac-10 expanded to the Pac-12, USC will receive the “easier” rotation of opponents from the states of Oregon and Washington. Instead of facing Oregon and Washington, who have both shown an annoying propensity for upsets over USC in recent years, the Trojans will play Oregon State and Washington State in 2013. Despite the Beavers’ impressive 8-3 showing this year, on balance, USC lucks out. Oregon State can’t match the Ducks’ high-octane offense.
Washington State wallowed through a 3-9 campaign this season under first-year coach Mike Leach, were taken out to the woodshed in a 49-6 beatdown from Utah and were kind enough to give Colorado its only win of the season. Sounds like an easier matchup than Steve Sarkisian’s pesky Huskies.
In addition, all the Pac-12 opponents that USC lost to this year and have to play again next season (Stanford, UCLA, Arizona) will have to visit the Coliseum.
Outside of Notre Dame, the Trojans’ nonconference schedule (Hawaii, Boston College, Utah State) is cake. And will the Fighting Irish really be the same without Heisman candidate Manti Te’o anchoring their defense?
If you play it safe and chalk up three nonconference wins and potential victories against California (3-9 this year), Utah (5-7), Colorado (1-11) and Washington State (3-9), that’s seven wins.
If the team defeats Arizona State (7-5) again and gets revenge against Arizona (7-5), which is admittedly far from a sure thing, that’s nine.
And the team will have a shot to rebound against Stanford and UCLA, which are both losing star senior running backs in Stepfan Taylor and Johnathan Franklin, respectively.
If the Trojans can beat the Cardinal or the Bruins, a trip to the Pac-12 championship is likely, where USC would be just one win away from the Rose Bowl.
At that point, even if it loses, an 11-2 USC squad would get some attention for an at-large spot in a BCS bowl.
 
Counterpoint: Despite returning several starters, there’s no guarantee USC will improve markedly.
College football players don’t always follow linear progressions during their careers. History bears that many of these athletes won’t improve significantly as they rack up more games, because, at some point, players are who they are.
Why does this matter and how does it pertain to USC?
In the coming months, several pundits will argue that, since USC returns a lot of starters next season, the team should be considered a dark horse BCS competitor.
But before we assume returning USC players’ continued development, it’s necessary to see if the statistics really reflect what we have come to expect.
Undeniably, the greatest problem with USC during Kiffin’s tenure has been the lack of star power on defense — the dearth of game-breakers who can rip through an offensive line for a crucial sack or haul in a timely interception. Simply put, no player on the Trojans’ 2012 defense kept opposing offensive coordinators up at night.
When looking at the embarrassment of recruiting riches on defense, how can it be that none of these players can consistently terrorize offenses? Frankly, for whatever reason, Trojan defensive players who impressed as underclassmen have failed to make the leap to All-American status later in their careers.
Perhaps senior safety T.J. McDonald — billed as the face of USC’s defense — best exemplifies this trend. In 2010, McDonald notched a team-leading 89 tackles and three interceptions while also appearing on the All-Pac-10 second team. This season, McDonald closely approximated those numbers, registering 99 tackles and two interceptions and once again earning selection to the All-Pac-12 second team.
In essence, McDonald performed at the same exact level as he did as a sophomore: one of the Pac-12’s top safeties, but nowhere near a national household name like Georgia linebacker Jarvis Jones or Notre Dame linebacker Manti Te’o.
Even if junior cornerback Nickell Robey departs for the NFL, Trojan fans will take solace from their defense’s front seven remaining largely intact and presumably taking a step forward next season.
But many of the starters who returned from 2011 stagnated or even regressed in 2012.  Let’s employ sophomore linebackers Hayes Pullard and Dion Baliey as a case study, as many expect them to assume McDonald’s mantle as the cornerstone of USC’s defense going forward. Last season, they combined for 162 tackles, two interceptions and three forced fumbles; this season, they saw only incremental improvements, as they had 166 tackles, five interceptions and two forced fumbles. Clearly, more was expected.
Given that recent years have shown we can’t assume continued improvement in core defensive players, it’s all the more distressing that the secondary might lose three of its four starters. Sophomore cornerback Josh Shaw — the only one definitively returning — cannot even stake a claim to a cornerback spot, as USC coach Lane Kiffin has hinted at transitioning him back to his natural safety position.
A secondary that surrendered 239.7 passing yards per game will quite possibly break in new starters at all four secondary positions, which is especially disconcerting because USC’s greatest talent deficiency probably lies at cornerback.
Thus, a mediocre — bordering on awful, at times — defense that surrendered 24.6 points per game in the pass-happy Pac-12 will probably get worse before it gets better.
On offense, a lot of the same question marks apply. For the second consecutive season, USC will lose its best offensive lineman — senior center Khaled Holmes — but return four other starters. Unfortunately, none of the returning offensive lineman distinguished themselves particularly well in 2012, outside of perhaps freshman tackle Max Tuerk and junior guard John Martinez, who both earned All-Pac-12 honorable mention, albeit along with a host of linemen from almost every other school.
Though a steady contributor, junior running back Silas Redd — the presumptive favorite to take over No. 1 tailback duties next season — hasn’t come close to approaching his numbers at Penn State in his first season in Los Angeles. Factor in questions about his durability and his ball security issues and it’s difficult to assume USC can improve upon its 155 rushing yards per game (70th in the nation), especially with senior Curtis McNeal leaving.
All of these issues crop up before even broaching the most drastic transition USC will undergo: the changing of the guard from senior quarterback Matt Barkley to redshirt freshman Max Wittek. Though many, including myself, are bullish on Wittek’s future, there’s no question that we should anticipate growing pains. The drop-off from Barkley to Wittek will be fairly steep, and that’s more of a compliment to Barkley than a criticism of Wittek.
USC’s easier schedule and the possibility for unexpected breakthrough performances — think junior defensive end Morgan Breslin this season — certainly leave open the chance for a BCS bowl game berth.
But don’t be surprised if USC settles in near the top middle-third of the Pac-12 next fall as well.
UO has “upset” USC in recent years????
UO has won 4 of 6 and one of those losses was an upset…an upset by USC of UO last year in Eugene.  The Ducks are a much much better program than USC is right now.
That comment regarding UO by the writers pretty much demonstrates the dreamland most Trojan fans live in.
5 losses this year were predictable, given the reduction in scholarships
Even with the “improved” schedule, USC will be fortunate to win 5 games next season..
They will be fortunate to win 3 in 2014
I do not think the USC fans understand how difficult it is to compete with scholarship reductions.
If your rationale for USC to have a better season in 2013 is an “Easier” schedule, then that’s a very sad commentary on the state of USC football. This was the year to have a great season and it didn’t happen. Sadly, in 2013-2015 I see the Trojan program continuing to slide even further into mediocrity. Stanford, Oregon, and UCLA are the Big Dogs in the PAC-12 now and somewhere down the pecking order is USC. It’s downright depressing!
Lane Kiffin ruined Tennessee in one season.  Admittedly that program was going down, but he destroyed it.  Leave him at USC another year, and you will be down for the rest of the decade before someone can turn it around.  And no, Tennessee, still looking for a coach that can clean up Kiffin’s mess there, will not rehire him if USC does the smart thing and fires him immediately.  Considering Knoxville mulled the idea of naming a sewage treatment plant after him, they would not even hire him at minimum wage to clean the locker room toilets.
Will: You are wrong in all accounts. The problem here at USC is Kiffin. You also forgot to write about the deflated balls and switching of the jerseys. That, at best, is troubling. But, all the points you are making in defense of Kiffin, have been debunked already by the experts and by simple common sense. Our season is going to fall flat next year so my advise to everyone would be to a) count on it; and b) don’t expect anything.

Every time my mother asks me if I’m seeing someone, I almost have the same exact answer. Besides cringing at the thought of talking about boys with her, I have to try and explain the act of “talking.”
“No, Mom, I’m not official with someone yet, we’re just talking.”
“Well, obviously you’re talking to the person.”
“No, Mom, as in texting.”
“What does talking-texting even mean, Sheridan?”
“It’s hard to explain.”
In fact, it’s quite difficult to explain what talking-texting means to a “32-year-old” woman (you’re welcome, Mom). But when speaking to others of our generation, it’s just something that we inherently understand. Meet someone cute, they text you with their name, you add it to your contacts and your talking-texting has commenced.
That’s just the easy part, though. What do you do once you’ve swapped numbers? I’m prepared to say that college students probably spend more time attempting to figure out what to say in a text to someone they like than writing an actual paper.
“Look at what (insert name here) texted me! What do I text back?”
How often has one of your friends said that to you? How often have you said that to another person? In olden times, ink-laden letters were sent via carrier pigeon, full of beautiful words to woo their loved ones. Nowadays, it can take you a full hour to convince yourself that “lol” is the best response to a text.
I am one of those people, and I know that I’m not alone. I get asked all the time what to type on a friend’s touch-screen keyboard. If several of my friends’ relationships make it to the altar, I will finally get to tell their significant others that it was I — not the friend — who was talking to them for a while.
So if you need a little guidance in your texting endeavors, just follow my Three ‘F’s Rule: Funny, Free and Forceful. These steps are mostly fool-proof and can take off years of stress.
1. Funny: Be funny — hopefully that isn’t too difficult for you. No one likes a Debbie Downer, so when you can show off that self-deprecating (to a degree) humor to reel the other in, do so. Laughter is one thing that everyone has in common, and your witty sarcasm will be absolutely irresistible.
The stitch? Well, sometimes humor doesn’t come across well over text and you might get a “?” or “huh?” in reply. It’s important to understand the person you’re talking to and ask yourself one question: Do you think they have the brains to understand thoughtful humor, or did all of that partying burn up their brain cells?
Know your audience. If your special someone is into films, find a way to incorporate that in. “How was your night?” “Epic. It could be the next sequel to The Hangover.” Are they into politics? “This Spanish homework is so hard.” “No kidding, it’s like trying to understand Mitt Romney’s economic plan.”
Keep the jokes simple and cute, and you might just win them over.
2. Free: Your significant other needs to know that you’re available. How do you accomplish this without pasting a sign on your head reading “Desperate and Alone”? Start small. Ask them if they can help you with your impossible neuroscience homework in a passé way: “I’m about to give up on this Blackboard assignment. You might have to give me a crash course before our next exam.”
Next, move up to a coffee date. It’s casual, it’s right on campus and it’s a great way for two people to cross the threshold from friends to lovers. When I suggest this to friends, they usually freak out, thinking that it’s a way of declaring your love for someone. Really, stop overreacting. Ask them if they need a caffeine break, and take them to The Coffee Bean & Tea Leaf (the one at the cinema school, though. The Campus Center Coffee Bean is where romance goes to die).
And if you’re feeling confident, move into the real dating sphere. “Have you seen Anna Karenina yet? I remember the book from high school, and I really want to see how they did this adaptation. You in?”
Honestly, it doesn’t matter where you ask to take the person, it’s just important that you start spending one-on-one time with one another.
3. Forceful: Now don’t be a creep (I’ve definitely been guilty of this in the past), but make it known that you’re interested in the other person romantically. This is where you’re supposed to use those flirting skills and combine the previous two steps to make an impression.
Once you feel like the relationship is progressing nicely — and trust me, you’ll know if the other person is interested or not — start dropping more elaborate hints. If you previously asked them out to coffee or a movie, those could still be seen as friend-zone activities. So step it up a notch.
“What are you doing Friday night? There’s this taco place in Culver City that has our name on it.”
“Ugh, you like FC Barca instead of Real Madrid? You’re lucky you’re so cute — I’ll let you get away with it.”
“The line for the 9-0 is ridiculously long, but completely worth it if I get to hang out with you.”
Don’t forget a smiley or winky face or two. Even though emoticons usually make me want to throw a chair through a window, when it’s coming from a cute guy I’m into, I can’t help but buckle at the knees.
Yes, you might find these lines cringe-worthy now, but trust me, when you’re caught up in the early stages of romance, all the things that previously made you want to puke instead make you the happiest person alive.
Whatever you choose to type, try and stay true to yourself. Throw out all the rules saying you have to wait 20 minutes to text back or to not type long paragraphs — do what feels right.
And when in doubt, emojis always work.

Poster girl Kate Moss is nowhere to be found at Rag & Bone New York’s new L.A. clothing store, located on Melrose Avenue.
First-class fashion · Rag & Bone, originally based in New York, opened a Melrose Avenue store with a wide variety of New England styles. – Alex Rose | Daily Trojan
But perhaps this isn’t surprising. Rag & Bone fans are already aware of the contrast between overcast Manhattan and sunny Los Angeles, and the store’s series of gloomy photographs featuring a lovely, moody Moss only serves to make the distinction greater; naturally, such a Manhattan maiden wouldn’t be making an L.A. appearance.
Still, all joking aside, the shop is not without its share of the unexpected.
The small parking lot behind Rag & Bone’s new L.A. flagship store would come as a delightful surprise — Melrose Avenue is an infamous black hole for parking meter change — except that all the jet-black Benzes occupy several spaces each. At this, the average shopper would expect to find the store — a brooding, glass edifice, down the street from Urth Caffé at which the Entourage boys once liked to sip cappuccinos — filled with type-‘A’ personalities throwing around their weight in gold.
Instead, the glass walls of the large, overtly designed room encase a staff of three moving languidly about in their Rag & Bone Knits in too much natural sunlight. Except for a couple women tottering in and around the iron-pipe clothing racks in the dramatic “Deacon Boots,” the place seems empty. The new store, with its soundtrack of T. Rex and mild hip-hop heard a bit too prominently over fragments of conversation, has the air of a lemonade stand struggling in a neighborhood without a lot of traffic flow — if lemonade went for 50 bucks a pop. Perhaps all the type-‘A’s parked and bailed (skipped down to Urth for a capp after all?), or maybe they were simply hiding behind exposed raw wood beams, Victorian iron safes and the occasional packing crate of domesticated greenery.
It’s not that Melrose is devoid of luxury shoppers; on the contrary, Rag & Bone stands just down the street from Marc Jacobs and Alexander McQueen. Yet much like the way the store stands alone — down the block, seeming slightly out of nowhere — its collection seems out of context in bright, lethargic Los Angeles.
And given the wide assortment of the types of clothes offered, it’s difficult to determine the brand’s target buyer. A stylish entertainment lawyer? An older woman looking for conservative tailoring with the pizzazz of lurex? Except for the array of colorful skinny jeans and tiny leather shorts, very few things seem fit for a party girl, a grungy girl or, in other words, the likes of poster girl Moss. For a store whose merchandise is older — not only in its ideal clientele, but also in its vibe and aesthetic narrative — Moss seems a bit younger, a bit fragile, a bit frivolous.
Also, a bit English. It does seem that Rag & Bone has borrowed much from English import All Saints Spitalfields, from its steam-punk presentation to its hard-edged leathers and smattering of Very Serious Sparkles. Yet at the center of Rag & Bone are its traditional cuts, heavy construction and impeccable tailoring. The tension between ensembles perfect for stuffy New England parents and those made for Moss’ entourage is confusing. And while walking the aisles, thumbing pieces like the “Biker Tailcoat” (a red leather riding vest with black tails), a customer can almost hear each outfit murmur: “I heart New York.”
But that is not to say that Rag & Bone should be restricted to East Coasters; that would be a shame. The brand makes absolutely beautiful women’s clothes. Its separates and knits are wearable and chic; its pumps and boots are well constructed and stylish; its tailored jackets (big this season), such as the knockout piece “Raj Jacket,” are often loud statements, but are always amazing to behold on a hanger. Unfortunately, the brand’s aesthetic, albeit refreshing, is perhaps too hard-edged for the L.A. crowd.
Its menswear likewise features conservative cuts for urbanites. The shop presents pieces in Victorian iron safes, which are appropriate given the prices but inappropriate for many Angelenos, the ultimate chasers of the contemporary. Many of the men’s outfits seem destined to accompany the wearer on a business trip to New York or Chicago. The featured window item is a striking, long burgundy coat with a high collar to protect the neck from sleet and wind — a bit of a stretch for a city that thinks a temperature in the mid-60s is “freezing.”
Some might understand the unique, euphoric rebellion of wearing a wool sweater in 80-degree heat, but most people in Los Angeles put a premium on comfort. So though many might gravitate to the Rag & Bone jean bar — comfortable and chic — customers might not as readily bring home wool and coyote fur (“Belfast Coat”). Rag & Bone might just be a brand with a New York sensibility trying to make it in the LA-LA land of yoga pants and flip-flops.
Rag & Bone will successfully continue to peddle its jeans, knits and tasteful basics at department stores and boutiques (e.g. Barney’s, Intermix). Any of these items would be ideal for college students looking to splurge on pieces that will elevate their wardrobes. It remains to be seen, however, if the New York brand’s new L.A. outpost will draw big crowds. During the next few months, check the raw concrete floors for scuff marks and holler if you see Moss.

Almost three years after the release of her fourth studio album, The Element of Freedom, Alicia Keys is set to burn up the neo-soul genre with Girl on Fire.
Sultry songstress · Alicia Keys’ latest album, Girl on Fire, tonally differentiates itself from 2001’s Songs in A Minor and 2003’s Diary of Alicia Keys, but the talented singer-songwriter offers fans an enjoyable mix of daring, up-tempo tracks and passionate slow jams. – | Photo by Michelangelo Di Battista, courtesy of RCA Music Group
The 13-track album comes as a bit of a respite for diehard fans of the singer-songwriter who took the Billboard charts by surprise in 2001 with her first major single, “Fallin’.” Flaunting optimistic themes and declarations of self-exploration, the much-anticipated album release will satisfy anxious listeners after a hiatus characterized more by Keys’ marriage to producer Swizz Beats and the birth of her son Egypt than her music. And even among other long-awaited releases, such as Keyshia Cole’s Woman to Woman and Rihanna’s Unapologetic, Girl on Fire manages to hold its own spark.
Keys lulls listeners into her new work with her characteristic piano instrumental opener, a mood-setting technique she’s employed on each of her previous albums. “De Novo Adagio (Intro)” features a compelling piano melody that perfectly segues into the album’s next track, “Brand New Me.”
Perhaps “Brand New Me” stands out as one of Girl on Fire’s best numbers. Here, Keys aptly fluctuates between soft vocals, teasing verses and forceful bridges — all of which accompany powerful lyrics.
“It’s been awhile,” Keys sings. “I’m not who I was before / You look surprised / Your words don’t burn me anymore.”
With her latest album, it’s easy to see that the songstress’ exclamations go beyond the superficial. Given the tone and style of the album’s subsequent tracks, Girl on Fire has Keys moving away from the more soulful, jazz-R&B meld of 2001’s Songs in A Minor and  2003’s  Diary of Alicia Keys — lamentable, but her new sound works. Her lighter tone and raspier vocals hint at an evolved Alicia, one comfortable in her own skin and aware that she has nothing to prove. Just listen to the way she includes her son Egypt’s cooing on “When It’s All Over.” She’s clearly not concerned about comparisons with Beyoncé and Jay-Z’s inclusion of a two-day-old Blue Ivy on “Glory.”
That being said, however, Keys certainly takes risks on Girl on Fire. For her fifth album, she’s adopted an edgier, liberated style fully realized on tracks such as the head-bobbing “New Day,” the reggae-inspired “Limitedless” and the titular “Girl on Fire (Inferno Version).” The latter, which met critical acclaim during its September debut, features a daring drum beat accentuated by assured, soaring vocals from Keys. Hip-hop star Nicki Minaj serves as a collaborator on the track, but even with her forceful rap enhancing the knockout number, it’s clear that Keys has the strength and confidence to hold down the song on her own. Fans who choose to download the main or bluelight versions of “Girl on Fire” — unfortunately unavailable on the complete album — will still get the same effect.
“New Day,” which Keys leaked in lyric-video form over the summer, employs a similar confidence. With a buzzing guitar line generating tension within the first few seconds of the song and volatile snare drums matching Keys’ upbeat vocals, “New Day” adds a catchy, rhythmic element to Girl on Fire. The album’s anthemic fifth track is the stuff of off-the-wall house parties or concerts teeming with fans waving their hands in the air.
But even with these up-tempo numbers, Keys doesn’t allow her fire-inspired theme to dominate her latest album. Cooler, metropolitan ballads, such as “When It’s All Over” and “Listen to Your Heart,” take the listener to a more relaxed state. Jazz-influenced piano lines and muffled, moving percussion hint at Keys’ early days, when tracks like “Diary” and “A Woman’s Worth” defined her as the urban queen of R&B.
Keys takes it down another notch with “Not Even the King,” a number hinging on Keys’ intimate vocals and a soft, patterned piano line. Thematically similar to Diary of Alicia Keys’ “If I Ain’t Got You,” the number showcases Keys’ imperfect but intriguing vocals. Though the song is hardly musically dynamic, Keys manages to hold the listener’s attention with lyrical imagery and sincerity. Descriptions of embraces “worth more than a kingdom” and a love that surpasses “money,” “diamonds” and “castles” captivate with unabashed honesty and celebrated emotional intimacy.
But against this thematically pure track stands the sultry “Fire We Make,” a collaboration with R&B crooner Maxwell. If “Not Even the King” enchants with depictions of true love, “Fire We Make” seduces with sexual passion.
“I wanna tell you just how I feel,” sings Keys in heightened anticipation. “I wanna love you baby / And it’s going so right.”
And with Maxwell’s drawn-out falsetto verbalizing the track’s love-making images — images suggested by a muggy line heavy on brass and electric guitar instrumentals — “Fire We Make” adds a more physical dimension to Girl on Fire’s proclaimed fascination with burning.
Still, though “Fire We Make” and “Brand New Me” form the highlights of the album, every song remains playable. “Tears Always Win” impresses with a background-heavy chorus and unexpectedly uplifting lyrics, and “That’s When I Knew” provides a sweeter take on memories of love accented by a refreshing, mellow guitar. And as she closes the album with the subtly dynamic “101,” Keys completes a mature album that caters to a variety of sounds and styles.
“You can try but you’ll never forget her name,” wails Keys on “Girl on Fire (Inferno Version).” “She’s on top of the world / Hotter than the hottest girls.”
With Girl on Fire, the timeless talent defends her throne on the R&B stage and delivers an excellent follow-up to albums that have garnered 14 Grammy wins. Though she hardly needed the affirmation, Keys solidifies her reputation as one of the most unforgettable artists of today’s generation. Burn, baby, burn.

On Wednesday, British Prime Minister David Cameron came out in support of an “independent regulatory system” to oversee Britain’s scandal-torn media. In the last two years, one of the biggest scandals dealt with Rupert Murdoch’s global media company, News Corporation, which came under fire for phone hacking, bribery and other desultory journalistic practices.
Kate Wong | Daily Trojan
Though Cameron’s attempt to address the problems in the media is commendable, there is little government regulation can do to reform the media without compromising free speech. If the media and government do not remain separate, news organizations’ ability to act as a check on government power is eroded. Rather than increased regulation, the news media industry, both in Great Britain and the United States, needs more independent journalism outlets to create a system in which unethical news corporations and their respective publications will be held accountable.
Currently, six major media conglomerates, including News Corporation, control 90 percent of the media that Americans consume. This pseudo-monopoly of control allows these corporations to often get away with extremely unprofessional conduct. There are allegations that the phone hacking scandal at News Corporation included not only celebrities and politicians, but also the families of fallen soldiers in Iraq and Afghanistan. Media companies like News Corporation, which are of immense size, resources and influence, are thus enabled to practice this kind of unethical journalism. And large media corporations dictate so much of the media Americans consume that it is difficult to boycott or refuse to support them.
Cameron’s resolution to this problem for the British press is to create an independent regulatory body with certain formal powers over the press,  designed to moderate and reverse the media’s propensity for unethical practices. Though Cameron’s proposal concerns media in Great Britain, it addresses many of the issues also seen in American companies. His proposed reforms, however, involve the possibility of government regulation, which would compromise the media’s role as a watchdog.
Any kind of government-led control over media is suspect. Even if a government body was able to regulate news outlets fairly, there would be too much room for the government to regulate in its favor. By involving itself, the government would undermine its own credibility and that of the news publications it is trying to control.
This isn’t to say, however, that the problem of a few large companies monopolizing media control doesn’t need to be addressed. According to News Corporation’s website, the company has assets of approximately $60 billion and operates worldwide. Its resources and influence are obviously  too great to go unchecked.  And rather than maintaining high standards of journalistic integrity, companies like New Corporation become businesses focused on earning profits and gaining influence. Coupled with media corporations’ vast resources, this emphasis on earnings creates an environment in which companies are more likely to engage in questionable practices to “get the scoop.”
The answer to this problem is not government regulation. Media consumers, rather, should make an effort to support fully independent publications that prove themselves based on credibility and quality, not size and profits. If these kinds of publications — blogs, local newspapers or anything else not controlled by major corporations — gain momentum, it will force the larger publications to follow their example to compete.
Cameron’s ideas address issues that plague the news media globally: a concentration of power in too few companies and a lack of responsible journalism as a result. If left unchecked, unethical news practices could grow to become the norm, potentially destroying readers’ trust in news and forcing future generations to cope with a world of shaky information.

A Trojans Alert sent out Monday night reporting a shooting south of campus turned out to be a false alarm — but not necessarily a worthless one.
Though students have accused the Dept. of Public Safety of sacrificing accuracy for speed when it comes to its emergency notification system, Monday night’s prompt and prudent response was ultimately a good decision. It is better to be safe than sorry in potential violent crime situations.
On Monday evening, two Trojans Alert messages were sent out. One alerted students, faculty and staff to a shooting in the area of Exposition Boulevard and Menlo Avenue. The second said that earlier reports had been unfounded and that the area was safe.
Now, what happened is clear. A DPS officer on routine patrol on the evening of the incident heard what sounded like a gunshot. Immediately afterward, a man in the area claimed to have been shot at by a passing vehicle. The man identified the vehicle as a white Toyota truck with a camper shell, alleging that three Hispanic males were in the car.
Within minutes, it was determined that the presumed “gunshot” was actually the sound of a car backfiring.
DPS, however, acted appropriately by immediately alerting students of the incident. As the report indicates, DPS had legitimate reason to believe that a shooting had occurred and acted in the interest of keeping students as informed and safe as possible in a state of potential emergency.
In the aftermath of the Halloween shooting, DPS was harshly criticized for responding too slowly to the incident, sending emails and text messages to students, faculty and staff at 12:02 a.m. for a crime that occurred around 11:45 p.m. In this week’s case, the shooting claims were cleared within eight minutes of the original alert. Therefore, despite the initial inaccuracy, students still received a complete and accurate report of the incident in a faster time than during the incident on Halloween.
This time around, the short time span to send out the first and second messages proves DPS has made good on its promise to alert students promptly. Officials did right by students, faculty and staff by acting upon what was known at the time. For those complaining about the false alarm, what if it had been a real shooting? What if the Trojans Alert had been sent out later and students lives had been endangered? To say the least, getting startled by false alarms is much less of an inconvenience than being potentially uninformed amid a dangerous scenario.
But some might argue that such tendency for false alarms is exactly the problem. If inaccurate but speedy messages become the norm, the Trojans Alert system might very well be delegitimized.
To maintain credibility, DPS should strike a balance between accuracy and speed by characterizing the situation as accurately as possible. Conclusive statements, such as the subject line of the email sent out, “Shooting Has Occurred,” should be avoided until a thorough investigation has been conducted. In this case, the shooting should have been characterized as alleged.
Nevertheless, DPS acted well under pressure. Its choice to send out the Trojans Alert immediately demonstrates that students’ safety really is a top priority, and if this means false alarms, so be it. To choose to err on the side of caution is essential to maintaining the university community’s security and safety.
