The Global Poverty Project will screen a movie at USC about extreme poverty and the role of activism in preventing such conditions on Friday in Taper Hall.
Actress Olivia Wilde will join Hugh Evans, the CEO of the Global Poverty Project and Bobby Bailey, the founder of Invisible Children, the creators of the movie 1.4 Billion Reasons — an interactive presentation about poverty worldwide.
“[The movie] is about 1.4 billions reasons to create awareness that there are 1.4 billion people living on $1.25 or less a day and that we can creatively use our gifts and talents to solve this problem,” said Devon Feldmeth, president of USC’s chapter of Invisible Children.
The presentation was developed by Evans and Bailey, a USC alumnus.
“What makes Bailey so unique is that he is a Trojan and he went to Africa to find a story,” Feldmeth said. “Now he is inspiring people to tell their story and leave a legacy.”
Wilde will attend the event to represent and promote her charity ,Young Artists for Peace and Justice.
The presentation emphasizes the importance of activism and the necessity of every person in order to eliminate worldwide poverty, Bailey said.
“The idea is to say that this is the first generation in human history that is treating poverty to be solved, rather than be navigated,” Bailey said. “Large bills won’t solve poverty; it’s going to require activism and the voice of the youth.”
Bailey defined activism as “the use of our own tools to solve the problems of society.”
Feldmeth stressed that the event provides a chance for USC students to become involved in an emerging movement in its early stages of development.
“This is an opportunity to be tied to this company that is going to be a hard-hitting dedicated force in the near future,” Feldmeth said.
The presentation highlights the progress that needs to be made, but at the same time underlines the progress that has already occurred, Bailey said.
“Between 1982 and 2005, extreme poverty was cut in half from 52 percent to 27 percent,” Bailey said. “Countries like South Korea were able to pull out of poverty through manufacturing and infrastructure, but poverty is still an intense fight.”
The goal of the presentation, Feldmeth said, is to reveal the severity of poverty to the audience members and instill in them confidence that they can help obliterate this global problem — or any other adversity facing society.
“We want the presentation to elicit a positive response that it is possible to change the world,” she said. “We can use our education to really shape how we fight injustices and poverty by finding creative ways to really tackle these issues so that they are not these impossible things to solve.”
Audrey Tyau, a sophomore majoring in accounting who plans on attending the presentation, said she wants to learn about poverty and share that knowledge with other students.
“I hope to gain deeper insight into how poverty is affecting the world and do my part to spread the word and tell other people how they can help,” Tyau said.
The presentation will be held on Friday at 7 p.m. in Taper Hall, room 101.

A panel titled “Welcome to Gay Town” explored the idea of the gay community as an ethnic and cultural idea Wednesday night and featured panelists such as West Hollywood Mayor John Heilman.
Gay pride · Major Pro Tempore John Duran (middle), spoke about the formation of a gay community and its role in society Wednesday. - Rachel Bracker | Daily Trojan 
Heilman, who has served on the city council since the city’s incorporation in 1984, and West Hollywood Major Pro Tempore John Duran said having a centralized gay community has affected the gay rights’ movement and the integration of LGBT individuals.
“It wasn’t a conscious effort to develop into a gay community. It was an organic development that took place as people felt comfortable within the community,” Heilman said. “It was a lot of like-minded people coming together because they were attracted for different reasons.”
The campaign to establish an independent City of West Hollywood was been spearheaded by a coalition of LGBT activists. Its first city council had three openly gay members, making it the first city in the county to have an openly gay majority governing body.
The panel also included senior policy counsel for the Los Angeles Gay & Lesbian Center Sky Johnson, Southern California program manager for the Gay-Straight Alliance Network Daniel E. Solis and associate professor of clinical education at the USC Rossier School of Education Mary Andres.
Solis, who works mostly with middle and high school gay-straight alliance groups said that, although the gay community has made many strides, there are still problems.
“You’re okay now: you have characters on Glee and Ellen is the new Oprah. That’s not true, there are parts of L.A. that are not safe … and you have to recognize that,” Solis said. “A lot of schools don’t know what to do about transgendered students in terms of bathrooms, P.E. and other things. … That’s something that we as a community need to attend to and something we need to advocate for.”
The panel also discussed the HIV and AIDS epidemic affecting the community.
“HIV and AIDS in many ways pushed the community together. The first time we all got together, we met in West Hollywood in Plumber Park. We were setting up chairs row by row and a group of lesbians came in and said, ‘No, set them up in a circle so that everyone has an equal say,’ … so we spent an hour arguing about how to arrange the chairs,” Duran said. “We had to redefine the way we treated gender in order to work together.”
At the end of the panel, Johnson asked audience members how they felt about the use of the word “gay” as a pejorative.
Tiara Raffine, a graduate student studying social work, said she was strongly opposed because it implicitly condones a negative view of gays.
“The biggest issue that comes up is I’m sitting in a classroom and people are making fun of me and the teacher will do nothing. That makes me feel bad about myself as a person,” Raffine said. “It’s very problematic that we perpetuate that idea. Maybe it’s OK for adults who are more sure about who they are, more secure, but for the younger generation it’s very difficult.”
The event was hosted by the Office of Campus Activities and the LGBT Resource Center. It was moderated by Queer and Ally Student Assembly Executive Director Emily Allen and the Lambda LGBT Alumni Association Events Co-Chair Genevieve Flores, who graduated in the spring.

Gene Bickers, professor of physics and astronomy and vice provost for undergraduate programs, shared his thoughts about the evolution of scientific theory and its relevance to intelligent life during his “last lecture” hosted by the Torch and Tassel Chapter of USC Mortar Board on Wednesday night.
Wise words · Gene Bickers receives a gift from the USC Mortar Board after his lecture, where he spoke about the importance of college. - Chloe Stepney | Daily Trojan 
The idea for the Last Lecture Series comes from the late Randy Pausch, computer science professor at Carnegie Mellon University, said Evan Snyder, vice president of Mortar Board.
After being diagnosed with pancreatic cancer, Pausch gave a speech at CMU announcing his diagnosis and sharing with the audience important life lessons and aspirations. He then wrote a book, The Last Lecture, which discussed similar sentiments.
“The format became widely known through his book,” Snyder said. “That’s where Mortar Board got the idea for the event.”
After entering the event and standing before the packed room in Seaver Science Library, Bickers joked, “This is so intimidating; I thought we would have a small group.”
Bickers began his lecture by telling the audience that friendship was what he valued most about his experiences both in college and through teaching.
“The thing that I have valued in being a faculty member is the lasting friendships I’ve been able to make with faculty, but particularly with students,” Bickers said.
Max Reynolds, a freshman majoring in mechanical engineering, said he came to the event to learn more about Bickers.
“I’m taking his class next semester,” he said. “I’ve heard all good things about him. He has a reputation as a really good teacher and I’m looking forward to getting a picture of who he is.”
James Meiners, a senior majoring in industrial and systems engineering, said he came to the lecture because of Bickers’ ability to engage students.
“He could be talking about anything and it would be something you’d want to listen to just because of how good he is at speaking and relating things,” Meiners said.
Bickers encouraged students to take advantage of the opportunities they have to make lasting relationships.
“Whether you go into industry, whether you go into business, or whether you teach, at some level, the thing you will value over time is the friends you make,” he said. “They will stay with you long after the experience is gone.”
Bickers has taught at USC at a variety of levels, having joined the faculty as an assistant professor in 1988. His research has focused on the physics of strongly correlated electrons in solids, and he has received numerous awards for excellence in teaching.
Bickers discussed the importance of certain mathematical numbers in our understanding of the universe and intelligent life. He also addressed topics such as Einstein’s theory of relativity, the Big Bang theory, the dimensions of space, intelligent design and string theory.
“If you look at physics, we have a beautiful, elaborate theory that describes most of the universe as we deserve it and it’s been incredibly successful in a number of ways,” Bickers said. “The more I’ve learned about it over the years, the more remarkable I thought it was.”
Bickers said he wished he would have studied more philosophy in college to give himself a deeper meaning for the physical sciences.
“I don’t know what the answer is. There is an intelligent force behind all of this and that is why things are how they are,” said Bickers, who mentioned that this concept is often the foundation for religion.
Bickers concluded his lecture by referencing how far scientific thinking has come since the beginning of the 20th century, yet he said there is still more to discover.
“I hope we figure out some more of the answers,” Bickers said. “The exciting thing is that all of you here, I bet you’re still alive at the end of the 21st century.”

Katherine Schwarzenegger is perhaps best known as the daughter of Arnold Schwarzenegger — the outgoing governor of California, famous body builder and Terminator — and Maria Shriver, an award-winning journalist and philanthropist.
Sound mind, sound body · Junior Katherine Schwarzenegger spoke on campus Tuesday about the pressure facing women on body health. - Ted Gerike | Daily Trojan 
But people might not know that Katherine Schwarzenegger is also an undergraduate student in Annenberg School for Communication & Journalism and the author of recently released book, Rock What You’ve Got: Secrets to Loving Your Inner and Outer Beauty from Someone Who’s Been There and Back.
Schwarzenegger sat down in the Nazarian Pavilion with Lois Banner, a professor of gender studies in the College of Letters, Arts & Sciences on Tuesday evening, to discuss her book as well as body image issues that girls and women face today as a result of the changing culture and media.
Schwarzenegger said she first became interested in the importance of having a healthy body image when she interned for Dove’s Real Beauty campaign, which then inspired her to take a class about the media’s effects on women’s self-image.
To Schwarzenegger, it was both “shocking and disturbing” to discover how much pressure is put on young women to be thin and  how over-sexualized  they are at a young age.
“The majority of 8-year-olds in America are either on diets or have been on diets,” she said.
Although many people might think Schwarzenegger has lived a charmed life given her background,  she  said she too has dealt with bullies. In fourth grade, she said, she was made fun of for having big teeth and was called “Beaver Bucktooth.”
“The issue of body image is something that affects girls at age eight or age five but also at age 70,” Schwarzenegger said.
Her book, she said, was written as a “reference guide” for young women, a way for them to discover things on their own but also something to be used as a point of discussion.
“I think a lot of women in high school don’t think it’s an appropriate subject to talk about because they are embarrassed … but why not talk about it?” she said. “We’ve all experienced this. Why are we tearing each other down? We should build each other up.”
For Schwarzenegger, the media is one of the main culprits in creating unrealistic and unattainable beauty and body images through the extensive use of photoshopping and airbrushing.
Schwarzenegger and Banner also discussed the recent change in body concern and sexualization in the media and marketing, specifically how the age for these campaigns has become younger.
“You look at the Bratz dolls and you see they’re dressed like little baby hookers,” Schwarzenegger said.
The topic shifted to Banner’s history in the field of gender studies and how a feminist ideology can overcome the all-too-perfect, glamorous and overachieving Barbie doll.
Schwarzenegger also discussed some of the more positive outcomes of the change in media’s re-construction of women’s role in society.
“Women are more aware of how much they can achieve and that they can be independent on their own and not need to marry a man in order to be complete,” she said.
Still, Schwarzenegger discussed the importance of having a boyfriend or partner who is respectful.
“You should have the door opened for you. You should have the chair pulled out for you,” she said. “And I think it’s very important for every young woman to know that they deserve that.”
Returning to her original topic of coming to peace with one’s body, Schwarzenegger addressed the fear many women have of managing calories and dealing with the indulgence of sweets.
“I really encourage girls to have fun with food — be able to eat food,” she said.
Schwarzenegger also stressed the importance of exercising and having a healthy lifestyle.
“[Exercising] is not only good for your body, but it’s good for your mind,” she said.
Although Schwarzenegger said she believes having a poor body image is still a serious problem, she is hopeful about the future.
“You see more celebrities and people coming out in the media that are celebrating their curves and talking about how important it is to celebrate womanly features,” she said.
Concluding the discussion, Banner opened the floor for questions from the audience. In response to one question that asked for advice, Schwarzenegger gave tips to young women and anyone who feels unhappy with his or her body.
Sharing a piece of advice that her father gave her, she said to look at yourself as a glass half full, rather than a glass half empty.
Schwarzenegger also urged those in the audience to stop pointing out their flaws and instead to focus on what they liked about themselves.

It is created by only a few strokes — a white, mouthless, single-expression bobtail cat with a red bow.
Kitty craze · As part of Sanrio’s celebration of half a century of its company, Santa Monica was full of decorated cars, themed desserts and even people in costume paying homage to Hello Kitty and her friends. - Sophia Lee | Daily Trojan 
Yet, since the dawn of its creation in 1974 by the Japanese company Sanrio, Hello Kitty has been appended to every consumer product imaginable from pens, bags and plush toys to lunch boxes and toasters. And now, this blank-faced feline has arrived in Southern California to celebrate Sanrio’s 50th birthday.
Small Gift Los Angeles, a 10-day event at Santa Monica’s Barker Hangar, started the party last Friday and continues its celebration of all things Sanrio until Sunday.
Hello Kitty is not just for little girls in pink tutus and sparkly shoes. More than half the attendees on last Saturday’s Fan Appreciation Day were adults; some of them parents, but a significant number were genuine fans, excitedly toting cameras and Hello Kitty bags.
Many fans dressed up for the occasion, wearing Hello Kitty-adorned shirts and stockings, painting the trademark whiskers on their faces, and putting on headbands with a giant pink bow or cat ears. Some even traveled across the continent to Santa Monica just for this event.
Hello Kitty enjoys an almost cult-like following in all ages and races. The character was initially a huge hit in Asia and then spread to the Western Hemisphere, appearing on all sorts of consumer products, from stationery to kitchen appliances.
The wide popularity of this character led to the creation of many more Sanrio characters, such as Badtz-Maru, a spiky-haired penguin with an attitude, and Keroppi, a frog with bug eyes.
As expected, Sanrio went all out for its birthday bash. Enter Barker Hangar and you will be overwhelmed by the wealth of events going on at all corners. There is a mini golf course, two Hello Kitty smart cars, a gift shop, an art exhibition, a ferris wheel, food vendors, workshop areas and several game booths all crowded within the tight space. Giant balloons of the characters’ heads, each about the size of a small room, bob around the ceiling.
Although entrance is free, be prepared to spend money — lots of money. The parking fee itself is $10, so carpool if you can. The workshops, which differ every day and range from sushi bento-making to sand art, cost $25 each session.
In fact, Sanrio’s motto “Small Gift, Big Smile” can also be translated to “Small Gift, Big Money.” Its products are notoriously expensive, with the license’s net worth   at more than $1 billion. But the pop-up gift shop at Small Gift L.A. still had a long line that snaked across the hangar as attendees lined up for hours to stock up on $4 Hello Kitty pens and $60 Hello Kitty tote bags.
Bored boyfriends can also have fun at the indoor carnival, where they can try to score a plush doll for their significant others by “shooting stars” at the Little Twin Stars or throwing rings at the Chocopand Dough Toss. But once again, be prepared to stay in line and pay. Each ticket costs $2, and every game booth, golf course and ride requires a different amount of tickets.
Lines were also long at the several food trucks that visited to feed hungry fans, such as the popular Grilled Cheese Truck and Flying Pig truck. Just because Hello Kitty doesn’t have a mouth doesn’t mean she can’t feed her fans.
Besides regular food truck grub, fans who have wondered what Hello Kitty tastes like can also literally grab a taste of their favorite icons at Yogurtland. The popular yogurt chain has teamed up with Sanrio to serve character-inspired frozen yogurt and toppings at a flat rate of $5. Beard Papa, the popular Japanese cream puff bakery, also whips up some “Hello Kitty flavor” with a strawberry cream puff with sprinkles.
The free events, however, are actually the most entertaining.
Jamie Rivadeneira, owner of JapanLA, a Japanese pop culture shop off Melrose Avenue, curates an art exhibition that showcases artworks by 50 artists spinning their own interpretations on the iconic character.
Despite the minimalist artistry needed to draw the simple-lined characters, artists find Hello Kitty to be a good base to get their creative juices flowing, as she becomes demonized and fantasized under the imaginative hands of these artists.
In one particular painting, Hello Kitty is served up on a platter like a trussed turkey; in another sculpture, she takes on punk form, wielding armory, sporting bruises and surrounded by graffiti. Yet in another artwork, Hello Kitty takes on the pose of Jesus in DaVinci’s “The Last Supper,” breaking bread with her other Sanrio friends.
Viewing is free, but all of the artwork is for sale and selling fast, according to JapanLA. A 8.5-by-11 print costs between $25 to $40, and the original artworks sell for far more.
But opportunities to take your own pictures are free, and there are plenty of them: character props, fans in wacky costumes and life-size Sanrio characters pop up from time to time. Many attendees also climb inside Hello Kitty smart cars to pose for pictures.
Even if all other events may seem disappointing, the bragging rights — and photographic evidence — that you once met a bigger-than-life-sized Hello Kitty in a ball gown will make the trip worthwhile.
Really interesting post – thanks!!
I’ve recently starting selling Hello Kitty on my website as I’ve always loved them and find them so cute I thought they’d be easy to sell.
I didnt realise how divided people are about them though.  On twitter for example there are people on there who absolutely hate hello kitty and post aweful things to people who love them.   Perhaps they’re just not rock and roll enough?
By the way I think the car would be perfect as my company car :-)

In the past few weeks, European students have taken to the streets in protest, exercising their voices and demonstrating their discontent.
French protesters demonstrated against proposed changes to pension law, Ireland saw its largest student protest in a generation with more than 30,000 people marching in Dublin to oppose increased student registration fees and a peaceful protest in London of 50,000 people against increased tuition fees turned violent when rioters attacked the headquarters of the British Conservative party.
Here at USC, the scene is a little bit different. Last month, for instance, a Facebook event titled “USC Bike Ban Civil Disobedience” was created. More than 2,300 people said they would attend the bike ride through Trousdale Parkway to oppose restrictions on campus bike use. On the day of the event, a grand total of 12 people showed up.
I’m certainly not advocating that we take up the French students’ modus operandi and riot at every perceivable opportunity, but there is a definite disparity in the passion for activism displayed by our students. Sure, there was some slight rain on the day of the bike ban event, and Vice President for Student Affairs Michael L. Jackson sent an e-mail to students the day before attempting to diffuse the situation, but that event was still just one example of a general sense of complacency among our generation.
All too often students are content to let an issue pass by without fully expressing their voice as an influential part of American society. Maybe something happens that really angers some students, but usually all that comes out of it is a caustically worded Facebook status or even a few e-mails sent to a local representative if they’re really riled up.
Some complain that those in power don’t listen to us anyway, but that’s only because we haven’t made enough efforts to force them to listen. It’s a vicious cycle; politicians don’t put the needs of students at the top of their priorities because they know that we won’t turn out in full force at the polls or take definitive action in defense of what we believe in. We don’t pose a threat to their political security, so they don’t always fear letting us down as much as they should.
That doesn’t mean that students in the United States are as a rule indifferent to the issues around them, because we are not — there are a few promising examples of activism from some students.
Students in the California public higher education system, for example, have made clear their opposition to the continued budget cuts and increases in tuition that they have faced as a result for the past few years. The California State University system just announced a 15 percent increase in tuition, which comes right after a 32 percent increase implemented last year, and the University of California system is seeking an 8 percent increase on top of last year’s 32 percent increase.
Outside the CSU Office of the Chancellor last week, a group of more than 20 students protested the fee hike and demanded to be given the right to be present in a meeting of the UC Board of Trustees. The board met this week to discuss the tuition increase, prompting protests from students at their campuses as well as outside the meeting.
Although these instances of outspoken students are encouraging, the fact of the matter is that these small groups of students and marches of a  few hundred people pale in comparison to the massive demonstrations currently taking place in Europe. One of the most important aspects of a successful protest is media coverage, which allows the message to reach a much larger audience, and it is much more difficult for the media to ignore a 50,000-person march than a 20-person protest.
Even if we can’t gather such staggering numbers, we can still do more to express our voices as students. All we need is a base of involved students who are willing to take action on their opinions, and more will follow.
The USC Sierra Club Beyond Coal Campaign provides an excellent example of this involved base that is so important for the success of student activism. Not only have their members held events aimed toward educating the student body about their goal of eliminating the university’s dependence on coal energy, but they have also gone straight to the people who can effect change by making proposals to Undergraduate Student Government and encouraging President C. L. Max Nikias to make a commitment to end coal dependence.
If we want our concerns as students to be taken seriously, we have to illustrate our passion for what we believe in and follow these examples of committed activism. Writing a letter or starting a Facebook group is a good start, but don’t stop there. Strive to make your voice heard and don’t be afraid to shake things up a little bit if need be. Stay informed, find what you care about and involve yourself in your local government, whether it’s within the university or the city.
Paul Routledge, a writer for the Mirror News in England, called the student protests in London “a generation finding its voice.” We seem to still be struggling with this problem, but there are promising signs of progress. Who knows, maybe it will be a fellow Trojan who guides our generation toward finding its voice.
Jared Servantez is a freshman majoring in print and digital journalism.
Protest for the sake of protest is not encouraging. When you look at what the students were rioting about, it doesn’t even make sense. To hold up the European protests as a model is off-putting, frankly. Although your argument that people should find their passion and show their support is indeed valid. That’s why I was disappointed that campus media didn’t seem to show much interest in the fairly prominently placed student protest during the Obama visit.
Nice work Jared. Solidarity from the City University of New York.

For the ninth straight year, USC enrolled more international students than any other university in the United States, according to the annual Open Doors report by the Institute of International Education.
Jovanna Tosello | Daily Trojan
Approximately 8,000 USC international students were recorded last year. Though this achievement showcases USC’s diversity and enhances the overall student experience for both foreign and domestic students, there is a much larger end-goal beneath the surface.
USC’s biggest goal must be giving these international students incentives to stay in the United States beyond graduation — a crucial academic and economic mission during our generation. American institutions are slipping in the rankings — in college graduation rates, in fields such as math and science and in higher education opportunities.
This is a concern not to be taken lightly. In a recent address to the University of Texas at Austin, President Barack Obama said, “We know beyond a shadow of a doubt that countries that out-educate us today, they will out-compete us tomorrow.”
Despite a drop in the rankings, one thing going for U.S. academia is that it still has the most reputable universities on the globe. And as our global economy becomes more intertwined, it isn’t enough to open our doors to American students only. Clearly, this is a new age in which our nation’s elite universities are not only competing with each other but also competing with other universities in the world to rein in top-caliber students.
So far, our own universities are proving to be more than up to the challenge, as the United States hosts more international students than any other country.
On our own campus, we have the ability to interact with students from all over the world. Whether in the classroom, in student organizations, in Greek life or in internships, the opportunities for knowledge outside of our own culture are vast.
“International students from more than 110 different countries bring a wealth of experiences and viewpoints to our campus,” said Tony Tambascia, associate dean of student affairs.
As USC leads the way in attracting international students, it must also be the university to go to the next step — giving foreign students every reason to stay in the United States and contribute their skills to the American workforce.
Some might see education abroad from a different angle. “A global education prepares them [international students] to become leaders in their own countries and societies,” said Ann Stock, assistant secretary of state for Educational and Cultural Affairs, in a statement.
Universities such as USC, which employs thousands of people and has an impact on nearly every aspect of economic development in Los Angeles, should play a role in influencing our international students beyond the four short years of college.
According to the report, the State Department has successfully partnered with U.S. universities to attract international students to an American college education.
During these tough economic times, when our government is struggling to reform our education system’s shortcomings, the university administration will need to step up and meet the challenge of retaining our international students with innovation. In research support, our university and government can collaborate to find new ways to sponsor unique interdisciplinary projects in the emerging fields of technology and applied sciences.
But above all, the relationships that international students develop with other students and colleagues can convince them to forever remain entrenched in the university and in our outside community.
“The bonds our students form — and the insights they gain — remain with them for life,” President C. L. Max Nikias has said.
Let our education, diplomacy and business development coincide to attract students from the entire world while our universities help to restore our global standing.

Well said…. I have been hosting international students in
Texas for 25 years and have seen some of the hardest working / studying students come here to live and learn.
Alot of them come here to study inthe STEM fields and we are not doing enough to create working opportuntites for them to contribute.
Let’s find ways to maximize their contribution and provide stellar internecine and jobs for them. They will certainly help create new technologies , new industries and new jobs for everyone.
Hug an international student today and tell them Thanks for their fortitude and their contribution to the betterment of the world!
Best

The first official trailer for Warner Bros.’ 2011 blockbuster Green Lantern hit the Internet today, and it’s a little iffy.
One one hand, director Martin Campbell (Casino Royale) definitely has an epic scope in mind. The trailer is full of space action and aliens. On the other hand, there’s a lot of Iron Man-esque comedy on the part of Hal Jordan (Ryan Reynolds).
In terms of the plot, everything seems faithful to the comics (it looks to be drawing heavily from Geoff Johns’ recent “Secret Origins” arc), with the Green Lantern Corps getting a less geometric and more organic aesthetic in terms of design.
The trailer also gives so glimpses of the film’s cast, from alien mentor Sinestro (Mark Strong) to bad guy Hector Hammond (Peter Sarsgaard). Considering the movie is still more than half a year away from it’s release, the CGI — which the film is supposed to have a lot of — is a little rough, but the aesthetic definitely works.
Hopefully this is just one of those trailers that’s cut to appeal to a certain audience. The footage has a lot of potential — as long as it it true to the concept and does not try to ape a successful franchise.

Well that didn’t take long.
Only 40 minutes into her much-anticipated junior season, USC forward Briana Gilbreath already has some new hardwood to ring in the new year.
After her dominating 21-point, 10-rebound performance during the Women of Troy’s upset of No.22 Gonzaga last Friday, it appears the junior’s do-it-all opening act drew the eye of the Pac-10 Conference.
On Monday, Gilbreath was honored as the first recipient of the Pac-10 Player of the Week award for the 2010-2011 season.
In addition to her career-high 21 points, the Katy, Texas-native’s key bucket with 33 seconds remaining in the second half put the Trojans’ home opener out of reach at 78-71.
Monday’s announcement marked the first time the 2009-2010 Pac-10 Co-Defensive Player of the Year had won the weekly award — a feat the junior leader hopes to duplicate as she helps to lead the Trojans back to the NCAA Tournament for the first time in her collegiate career.
Last season, Gilbreath led the team in rebounds (5.9 per game), blocks (1.6 per game) and steals (1.8 per game), while also finishing second in points (15.1 per game).

The number of university presidents receiving salaries more than $ 1 million is rising, according to a report by The Chronicle for Higher Education that analyzed federal tax documents from the 2008-2009 fiscal year.
Of 448 institutions of higher learning survey, 30 presidents earned in the seven-figures range in 2008, including former USC president Steven B. Sample.
Sample had the fifth highest income of university presidents surveyed, reporting $1,913,927 in earnings.
However, this number was probably inflated, as top-earners are often university presidents who receive payouts when stepping down, according to the Los Angeles Times. Two of the top 10 earners had died and one president, in addition to Sample, was retired. In November 2009, the L.A. Times said Sample’s salary was approximately $800,000 a year.
The highest paid sitting president was Southern Methodist University’s Gerald R. Turner at just under $2.8 million in total compensation. But, according to the university, Turner cashed out a life-insurance policy and bought his own policy, increasing his total pay by $1.5 million.
Other schools with high-earning sitting presidents include Vanderbilt University (just more than $2.4 million), Columbia University (just less than $1.8 million) and Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute (more than $1.6 million).
Raymond D. Cotton, a lawyer who specializes in presidential contracts, told The Chronicle of Higher Education that he expects executive salaries to rise because more boards consist of businesspeople adopting practices from the for-profit sector. Many baby boomers who are college presidents are retiring, he said, and the boards will compete against each other for the best, making them more willing to offer larger salaries.
“Presidential compensation has been shooting up because of a disparity between supply and demand in the marketplace,” he told The Chronicle. “There continues to be a greater demand for people who can do these jobs well than there is a supply.”
