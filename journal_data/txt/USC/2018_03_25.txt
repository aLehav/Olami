Demonstrators, including some USC students, marched from Pershing Square to Grand Park at 9 a.m. The nationwide event was organized by student activists who survived the Feb. 14 school shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Fla. that resulted in the deaths of 17 people.
March for SC, a campaign organized by USC students and co-sponsored by various campus political advocacy groups and Undergraduate Student Government assemblies to protest gun violence, gathered at Tommy Trojan Saturday morning to go to the March for Our Lives together. According to Alec Vandenberg, a  March for SC student organizer, an estimated 40 students attended the March with March for SC. It is unknown how many other USC students attended.
USC students were able to take advantage of free Lyft rides to transport them to the March. According to Vandenberg, Lyft provided $15 ride credits for those who used the promo code “MFOLLA” to get to locations near Pershing Square.
“We really wanted to create a space and a platform for students to come together to not only speak about these issues but act upon them as well,” Vandenberg said. “USC as we all know is not necessarily the most active campus, but that’s definitely something we want to change, and we hope that this movement can start catalyzing other movements and conversations as well.”
The Los Angeles March was attended by an estimated 55,000 people, according to Mayor Eric Garcetti, and drew celebrity supporters such as Amy Schumer, Kendall Jenner and Zendaya. 
According to the Los Angeles Police Department, the downtown L.A. march was peaceful, with no reported arrests.
Ellie Schneider, a freshman majoring in journalism, attended the march with other students and her professor, Annenberg Program Administrator Courtney Miller. 
“For me, as a journalism major, it was exciting to see all of the journalists on the ground, whether as photographers, videographers or reporters documenting this historic moment,” Schneider said. “It was especially exciting to march with my Annenberg classmates and professor.”
Lilith Coryell Jenkins, a sophomore majoring in art history, also attended the march.
“Sometimes the fight for gun control seems so futile, we’ve been pushing for legislation and change for so long with no change, but today, to see thousands upon thousands of organized people standing up together for something we believe in was so inspiring and I truly believe that this fight is being reinvigorated and that change will happen,” Jenkins said. 
Vandenberg said that knowing the movement was led by younger generations was inspiring. 
“It was very empowering,” Vandenberg said. “When I look at the demographics of the crowd, I didn’t necessarily see a huge young group, [but] I know that generally this is a national movement led by predominantly younger people, so that was definitely inspiring and hopefully other students at USC or beyond can get more involved in the movement because that’s so pertinent to us, because our lives are quite literally at risk sometimes.” 
At the same time, Vandenberg noted that activism must continue if students want to see change. 
“This is only the beginning,” Vandenberg said. “When we march, that’s not the end. This is the start of the conversation, the start of how we engage with these issues and the start of greater activism.”

More than 800 people gathered for the USC Women’s Conference from Thursday to Saturday, participating in programs for female empowerment. This year’s theme was “Passion, Power and Wisdom.”
Alumna Jaime Lee, the president of the USC Alumni Association Board of Governors and CEO of Jamison Realty, Inc., spoke at the 10th Annual Women’s Conference that took place Thursday to Saturday. Photo from USC Alumni website.
To celebrate the conference’s 10th anniversary, Danielle Harvey Stinson, one of the event’s organizers, and the assistant vice president for alumni relations, added new components to the conference, including a program for children and the USC Women’s Business Expo. 
“If this conference is meant to be for all women, there are women with daughters who can’t take off and who can’t leave them or may not have childcare so let’s make this program accessible for them as well,” Stinson said.
Friday’s morning conference featured members of SCout, a science outreach organization, which taught girls how to extract strawberry DNA to encourage them to pursue careers in STEM. The afternoon workshop was hosted by Lemonade Day, another USC student organization, which teaches girls how to start and operate their own businesses.
Crystal Jones, a USC alumna, said that she was glad to bring her 7-year-old daughter Asa to the conference. 
The USC Women’s Business Expo featured 11 businesses run by female USC students. 
At the expo, graduate student Charity Prado, founder of SheCatalyst, said that USC lacked  leadership programs geared toward women.
“I noticed that entrepreneurial and business training programs tended to be designed around men,” Prado said. “Women start businesses at half the rate as men and it’s because there’s a feeling of not knowing where to start or what to do.”
Her business aims to close that gap by empowering women and giving them a community, enabling them to make the change they want in society, Prado said. 
Another panelist, Nikita Dhesikan, a senior majoring in biomedical engineering, founded IDENTITI, a company that creates custom gemstone bracelets. Dhesikan said she has encountered challenges as a woman in both the engineering and business worlds.
“A lot of the events are primarily male, whether it’s engineering or business and it’s definitely a little intimidating,” Dhesikan said. “Whether you go in big corporate buildings or even in conversations that I’ve had on this campus, there still is that culture where men run the room.”
However, Dhesikan said attending events like the USC Women’s Business Expo gives her hope that this culture will change in the near future.
Viviana Harvey, Stinson’s mother and a small business owner herself, has attended the conference for eight of the 10 years it has been running. She said she noticed a difference in the attendees this year following the #MeToo movement. 
“This year so far, I have noticed the women are even happier,” Harvey said. “They seem stronger, and they seem even more determined to take the information and use it in their respective communities and their job settings.” 
While the event was geared toward women, men were welcome to attend. Sean Kerns, a graduate student studying global supply chain management, attended the event with his girlfriend, who was originally supposed to speak on a panel. 
“I think there are a lot of good topics discussed and it’s important for men to be there as well so they can get that first-hand,” Kerns said. “I think they might miss out on a lot of the information here otherwise.”

The USC Office of Admissions on Thursday released statistics on the incoming freshman class of 2022, the most selective in USC history.
Karan Nevatia | Daily Trojan
Out of a record-breaking pool of 64,256 applicants — a 14 percent increase from last year and the largest jump in 20 years for a one-year period — only 8,258 students were admitted, according to USC News. 
The 13 percent acceptance rate marked the lowest ever in USC history, dropping 3 percentage points from the 16 percent acceptance rate for the class of 2021. 
“We’ve never had a harder time selecting which applicants to put in the classroom,” Timothy Brunold, USC dean of admission, said to USC News. “We could hardly believe the numbers, and now we’re feeling the pain of having to turn away so many candidates we admire. At the same time, it’s a breakthrough year for USC.”
According to USC News, this notable increase in the number of applicants was the biggest since 1999 with the exception of 2012, when the introduction of the Common Application caused a spike in applications.
Of those admitted this year, the average high school unweighted GPA is 3.84 on a 4-point scale, with 34 percent of admits having a 4.0 GPA. 
Approximately 85 percent of admits scored in the 95th percentile or higher on standardized tests, while 60 percent scored in the 99th.
“Grades and numbers are a starting point,” Brunold said to USC News. “We want a diverse class, and we think about which students our faculty want to teach, which students want to solve intractable problems. It’s a search-and-selection process that lines up with the University’s strategic plan, and the mature young people we admit bring something to the student body.”
According to the USC admissions blog, nearly 3,300 different high schools were represented from more than 87 countries in the incoming class of 2022. 
Sixteen percent of admits are international students, while 26 percent are from underrepresented minority groups. Additionally, one in seven admits will be the first in their family to attend college.
In the USC News release, Brunold attributed this record increase in applicants to high interest in new degree programs at several schools, as well as “the draw of student life enhancements like the massive USC Village.”

Ryan Fawwaz | Daily Trojan
Last Tuesday, former Vice President Joe Biden spoke at an anti-sexual assault rally at the University of Miami. After mentioning President Donald Trump’s notorious Access Hollywood tape scandal, Biden said, “If we were in high school, I’d take him behind the gym and beat the hell out of him, ” adding that “any guy that talked that way was usually the fattest, ugliest SOB in the room.” 
Trump added fuel to the fire on Thursday, tweeting, “Crazy Joe Biden is trying to act like a tough guy. Actually, he is weak, both mentally and physically, and yet he threatens me, for the second time, with physical assault. He doesn’t know me, but he would go down fast and hard, crying all the way. Don’t threaten people Joe!”
Under any circumstances, the thought of two grown men engaging in a war of words and throwing around threats of physical violence is, quite frankly, embarrassing; the fact that these words came from two world leaders in their 70s is deeply concerning. And yet, the situation is remarkably familiar: In a show of power, two men attempt to work out their issues through petty displays of manliness. It is but one example of the hypermasculine culture in which both Biden and Trump were raised — a toxic culture that lies at the heart of a mental health crisis affecting American boys and men, generations later. 
At the surface, hypermasculinity and the issue of gender-based violence more obviously manifest themselves as problems affecting women. And while that is certainly true, men also seem to fall victim to these same outdated notions — but nobody notices because, usually, the struggle is internalized. 
Put simply, the foundation of our modern yet outdated notions of masculinity is based on the idea that any feminine behavior is inherently weak and shameful. This means that “real” men stay away from dancing, cooking and — specifically applicable to Los Angeles — veganism. But more importantly, this means that men are restricted from communicating their emotions. 
This unhealthy tendency to bottle up one’s feelings only worsens the initial issue — often leading to increased risk of anxiety and depression. Lacking an outlet to fully express their issues in an acceptable manner, many men feel they have no way out. In the U.S., suicide is the second leading cause of death in men and boys under 35. 
Furthermore, the effects of these emotional struggles are not limited to only the men themselves. In a previous column I wrote about the shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Fla., I mentioned that when men are as emotionally damaged as the alleged shooter, they are confronted with a choice: further withdrawal or rage. Many resort to the latter, causing harm to just about anyone who crosses their paths; in the shooter’s case, 17 innocent people lost their lives because of his decision. 
Aside from physical rage, we can also examine toxic notions of masculinity through the lens of sexual assault. In a culture where young men are pressured to demonstrate that they are, indeed, men, sex often becomes an act not of affection, but domination. While this is not to say all — or even most — traditionally masculine men will attempt to commit sexual assault, a common thread among many such cases is the inherent need to confirm the aforementioned sense of power and superiority. For instance, with the examples of actors Louis C.K. and Kevin Spacey and entertainment mogul Harvey Weinstein, all of the abuse they were accused of were the results of their need to demonstrate and capitalize on their power over others. Even when these acts are met with disapproval — such as the previously mentioned exchange between Biden and Trump — many men still take it upon themselves to resolve such issues through physical violence, the ultimate display of hypermasculine power. 
And yet, as harmful and as prevalent as they are, sexual assault and physical violence are just the tip of the iceberg in terms of the damaging effects of being insecure in one’s masculinity. In addition to the homophobic notions that have become largely synonymous with hypermasculinity, this twisted mindset is also responsible for an increased risk of H.I.V. among gay and bisexual men. According to a study by Northwestern University, hypermasculinity and resulting feelings of anxiety and depression often lead to overcompensation, which is closely aligned with an increase in risky sexual behavior. 
For everyone’s sake, there has to be a way for us as a society to recognize and address the harmful consequences of perpetuating this hypermasculine culture. No more pressure to perform sexual conquests, and no more pressure to aggressively prove physical strength. No more pressure to “be a man” — just be yourself. Parents need to teach their sons to understand their emotional struggles, and when the burden becomes too heavy to bear, take them to see a mental health specialist — no matter the perceived stigma. No longer should boys be left alone to navigate the complexities of their masculinity.
Once again, I would like to make clear that many boys may not grow up to commit the devastating acts of hypermasculinity with which our society has become all too familiar. But there is a reason almost all school shootings and almost all cases of sexual violence are committed by men. Hypermasculinity is hurting boys, and turning the rest of us into collateral damage.

Los Angeles has one of the largest populations of chronically homeless people in the country. According to the Los Angeles Times, in the last six years, the homeless population surged by 75 percent. The Times also points out that “the problem has only gotten worse since Mayor Eric Garcetti took office in 2013 and a liberal Democratic supermajority emerged in 2016 on the county Board of Supervisors.” 
Shideh Ghandeharizadeh | Daily Trojan
Uniquely situated fewer than five miles from Skid Row, the epicenter of Los Angeles’ homeless crisis, the University must be aware of the problem and has the opportunity to contribute to solutions. Citizens and private organizations — including students at the University — have the ability to aid the homeless in ways the government does not.
In Los Angeles, the local city government has failed to approve enough housing permits to satisfy the need. In fact, a report last year from the California Housing Partnership Corporation revealed the city needs more than 500,000 new affordable units to satisfy demand. This shortage is largely due to overregulation and excessive rules that make acquiring building permits difficult. The restrictions on homebuilding aren’t limited to the city of Los Angeles either. As the Los Angeles Times explains, “[State] Legislators have shied away from tackling broad efforts to increase housing supply, such as overhauling the California Environmental Quality Act or reforming the tax code to incentivize residential development.”
The effect of this housing shortage is simple supply and demand. The more the demand for housing exceeds the supply, the less affordable the houses become. This scarcity increases the cost of living, thereby increasing the percentage of people who cannot afford a place to stay.
Liberal policies have only made matters worse. In 1978, the Los Angeles City Council passed rent control. Today, 80 percent of Los Angeles is covered by it. This, too, is a policy that ignores basic economics. The primary goal of rent control is to put an artificial cap on what landlords may charge their tenants, with the goal of making housing more affordable. To be of any use at all, these prices would necessarily be below equilibrium, or at the intersection of supply and demand. However, when prices are below this point of equilibrium, the quantity demanded exceeds the supply, which leads to a housing shortage.
These two factors resulted in a significant shortage in housing and an inability to pay for it, which — though not the sole cause of homelessness — certainly played a role.
Furthermore, the relaxation of laws involving drugs and low-level crime, as well as litigation from the American Civil Liberties Union barring law enforcement from making arrests, has increased the number of homeless people and made them worse off, not better. 
Two such laws are Senate Bill 180 and Proposition 47. Together, they reclassified many felonies to misdemeanors and made it difficult to send people involved with the abuse of drugs and alcohol back to prison. They also took away the leverage necessary to encourage offenders to enroll in rehabilitation programs. Without the threat of prison, courts have no way of persuading individuals into drug-treatment programs if they need it.
Additionally, the 2006 case Jones v. City of Los Angeles, brought before the Ninth Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals, resulted in a settlement that effectively allowed people to sleep on the streets without being arrested. This had an unintended consequence: Individuals were no longer taken in and given the help or treatment they needed. According to a study from the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, 38 percent of the homeless abuse alcohol, 26 percent abuse other substances and 25 percent suffer from mental illness. If they are never committed in the first place, those people will never receive the help they require.
These policy failures can only be remedied with policy solutions, and for that we’ll need politicians willing to reverse them. But as is often the case when government fails, local communities and groups of people can step up and make a difference.
In fact, religious groups and other non profits provide the majority of homeless shelters in Los Angeles already. Many non profits, like People Assisting the Homeless, Step Up and The Weingart Center, provide not only housing, but also services designed to help individuals get back on their feet.
Students at the University have contributed to the solution as well. They’ve partnered with the Los Angeles Homeless Service Authority to conduct surveys on the homeless, with the goal of learning more about the population to form possible solutions. They’ve formed clubs like A Community Place and Food Recovery Network, which seek to feed the homeless and supply them with daily necessities. University students also make up a variety of religious groups with outreach programs specifically geared toward helping the homeless.
As the Daily Trojan pointed out in January, “From student-run organizations to faculty-organized housing projects, the University has shown consistent dedication to solving this growing issue.”
It can seem like government is far removed from the people, and there’s not much we can do to help this situation, but local communities — including USC students — can make, and have made, a difference in the lives of Los Angeles’ homeless.

After seven seasons of the Comedy Central sitcom Workaholics, actors Blake Anderson, Adam Devine and Anders Holm are finally leaving the office. The trio’s action-comedy, Game Over, Man! debuts on Netflix on March 23, almost exactly a year after the Workaholics finale. 
(From left) Blake Anderson, Anders Holm and Adam Devine star in ‘Game Over, Man!’
In only a slight departure from their Workaholics characters, the three performers play a group of bored waitstaff on the verge of getting their video game concept funded, when a terrorist group storms their glitzy hotel and takes their benefactor and all of his guests hostage. Desperate to get their game funded, the bumbling, tuxedoed waiters have no choice but to fight their way through the hotel and save the day. The film maintains Workaholics’ signature voice — irreverence and cultural criticism mixed with joyously juvenile humor — all of which is taken to another level without the oversight of a TV network.
“It was refreshing to have all those freedom that a movie allows you to have,” Anderson said. “Especially at Netflix … they allow you to be as creative as you want to be. They also don’t have ‘R’ ratings, so anything goes.” 
The action elements of the film, which include numerous fight scenes and high-budget stunts, were a new and exciting challenge for the team. A key scene features the waiters hanging between two buildings on an ironing board-and-zip-tie contraption, Home Alone 2-style.
“We wanted to make the movie feel much larger than anything you’ve seen from us,” Devine said. 
“We’d never gotten to do a stunt of that scale, and it was pretty surreal to be on that big green screen stage, so that was a cool moment,” Anderson said. “It almost felt like we were Marvel heroes for a second.”
Intricate fight scenes also allowed the creators to invite their friends for small roles; performers like Saturday Night Live alumnus Fred Armisen, Veep star Sam Richardson and musicians Action Bronson and Flying Lotus make appearances. 
“Our friends are the only people we know, the only people who will respond to our phone calls and texts,” Devine said. “A lot of people we were calling out just for one day of work where you come in and basically just get killed, so you kind of have to pull the homies back for some of that.”
Game Over, Man! is the result of more than six years of steady collaboration among the comedic leads, director Kyle Newacheck and producers Seth Rogen, Evan Goldberg and Scott Rudin. 
“The story was something we were all throwing around, and I fancy myself as the writer of the crew, so I’m the one who goes off and kind of throws it all together,” Holm said, who has the head writing credit. “This is the group’s movie, and it’s a labor of love to write for these goddamn comedy geniuses.”
Through six years of refining, the movie script naturally underwent changes, but many key plot elements remained the same. 
“The things that have been there since the jump are that it takes place in a hotel, Shaggy, the asphyxiation, the full-frontal male nudity … and everything else was added later on,” Holm said. 
Devine was also careful to point out the addition of more recent cultural references, such as a pointed critique of vaping. “We’re bad boy maniacs, man. We come with all that hot sauce the kids like,” he said.
Still, Devine says that the logistics of creating a feature film were very different from those of a half-hour television series. 
“We got to this movie at kind of the perfect place in our lives and careers, to where we could do it and not have it feel like too much,” Devine said. “It is a lot to be given millions and millions of dollars to go off and make a movie, but since we were able to do Workaholics for so long, we got pretty comfortable steering the ship.”
For the ideal viewing experience, Devine recommends getting as close to the full cinematic experience as possible.
 “Watch it with friends on the biggest TV you can find, because it is a cool, big movie, and it’s kind of a shame to watch it on your phone,” he said. “This is a movie that I think will play better on a larger screen.”
Netflix originally planned to premiere Game Over, Man! on April 20, but announced in January that the release date would be moved up to March 23. 
“We’ve been sitting on the movie for a while and they were like, ‘Let’s just put it out,’ and also we like to think it’s a 4/20 gift for all the people that are celebrating 4/20 every day of their life,” Devine said. “We’ve been done with it for a while now, and are actually really excited for it to come out for everyone to see.”

Since skyrocketing to the top of the charts in 2013, Robin Thicke and Pharrell’s smash hit “Blurred Lines” has become one of the most consequential songs in recent history, due to its convoluted, three-year legal battle that has recently seen another conclusion. This week, the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals upheld a 2015 ruling that the song infringed upon the copyright of Marvin Gaye’s “Got to Give it Up,” although the methodology of the decision has many in the industry up in arms.
When the original jury made its decision three years ago, much was made of the limits of a standard copyright, of which there was confusion to whether or not the members fully understood. Typically, these copyrights are limited to the sound recording itself, as well as the song’s physical composition, such as the chords, melodies and lyrics. Place “Blurred Lines” next to “Got to Give it Up,” and many musicologists have agreed that there was no legitimate claim for infringement, as the two songs are structurally different.
That being the case, the feeling elicited by the two songs is undeniably similar. Thicke and his lawyers even alluded to this when they stated in a preemptive lawsuit that the idea behind the song “was to evoke an era,” essentially creating an experience for listeners that harkened back to the music of Gaye, among others. Historically, this has been acceptable, as there’s never been a law saying that the “vibe” of a song could be stolen — although that’s exactly the precedent this “Blurred Lines” ruling could set.
Because artists are constantly finding songwriting inspiration from the work of others, this kind of crossover is nearly inevitable, and at times even elicits praise rather than claims of theft. The vibe of Janelle Monáe’s “It’s Code” is eerily reminiscent of “Never Can Say Goodbye” by The Jackson 5, although none of the members received a songwriting credit. Rather than cries for Monáe to pay royalties to the group, she’s earned praise for harnessing that energy, as well as the energy of other earlier artists on songs throughout her discography, for future generations. More recently, Young M.A’s 2016 hit “OOOUUU” borrowed heavily from Bobby Shmurda’s “Hot N*gga” from two years prior, yet even the original creator didn’t see an issue, telling Complex, “it sounds like Brooklyn, it sounds like it’s supposed to sound like.”
Shideh Ghandeharizadeh | Daily Trojan
It’s relatively easy for established, wealthy artists to pay a portion of their sum back to the artists they take inspiration from, but for the aspiring musician still fighting for his or her voice to be heard, this change could have dire consequences. Commonly asked in interviews, the question “What inspired your sound?” becomes a dicey, expensive minefield rather than an innocent way to learn how a song came together; while in the actual studio, artists would become much more wary about incorporating their influences into their music, disrupting a natural timeline that has helped define generations.
None of these questions were considered in the appeals process, however — instead, it revolved around the actual court proceedings in the original case, and whether or not they were handled correctly. In a 2-1 decision, the panel of judges ruled that these proceedings were in fact carried out properly, while abstaining from a ruling on the actual verdict and whether or not it was just. Judge Jacqueline Nguyen touched on this in her dissent, however, saying the decision “strikes a devastating blow to future musicians” by opening the floodgates for infringement litigations. With plenty of evidence to support her viewpoint, it remains to be seen if the team behind “Blurred Lines” will look to push the issue into higher courts; and with much more at stake than the fate of the groovy single, there are plenty of onlookers who are hoping that they do.
Why I’m smiling: Trouble – Edgewood
Eight days after announcing his signing to Mike WiLL Made-It’s Ear Drummer imprint, Atlanta rapper Trouble has dropped a new mixtape entirely produced by the label’s head honcho to give fans a taste of what’s to come. Containing Mike WiLL’s signature hard-hitting 808’s next to biting, aggressive flows from Trouble, there’s a lot for rap fans to get excited about, highlighted on The Weeknd-assisted “Come Thru.”
Why I’m shaking my head: NAV takes shots at XXL’s Freshman List
Perhaps the blandest human being to hold a microphone in the past decade, XO-affiliated rapper NAV recently decided to tweet at hip-hop’s fellow bottom feeder, claiming, “I would never show up for the Freshman List cuz I don’t need their approval.” The annual “XXL Freshman List,” designed to showcase the genre’s brightest newcomers, often comes under fire due to its questionable artist selections, and any shade thrown at the once-esteemed publication is always welcomed over here. It’s just that much funnier when the responsible party has no business even releasing a song, let alone receiving praise for it.
Why I’m hopeful for the future: Rich the Kid – The World is Yours
A Kendrick Lamar feature can always do wonders for a surging career, and several months after “New Freezer” boosted Rich the Kid’s mainstream visibility, he’ll look to follow through on that potential with his debut studio album The World is Yours. Other singles such as “Plug Walk” gained heavy traction with placements on Spotify’s RapCaviar playlist, and now the album contains a star-studded tracklist that includes Lil Wayne, Swae Lee and Khalid. There’s plenty of deserved anticipation for the project; hopefully, the Atlanta-based rapper is able to deliver.

The USC baseball team ended a brutal series against NorCal rival Stanford Sunday afternoon with an 18-0 loss, ending a 0-3 series.

The first game of the series was indicative of how the series would play out, as the Trojans fell by a score of 5-1. The Cardinal opened the scoring in the bottom of the second inning when senior second baseman Beau Branton singled off Trojan freshman starter Kyle Hurt with the bases loaded to score a run. Senior third baseman Jesse Kuet followed with a sacrifice fly to tack on another run. 
Stanford extended its lead in the following innings. In the third, sophomore catcher Maverick Handley hit a RBI single to right field. Two innings later, left fielder sophomore Kyle Stowers singled to the right side to score another run. True to its style, Stanford relied on its pitching and timely hitting to scrape out a 4-0 lead.
USC managed its sole run of the night when sophomore right fielder Matthew Acosta singled up the middle to score redshirt sophomore catcher Kaleb Murphy in the sixth inning. Handley, however, came right back with another RBI single in the next inning, giving the Cardinal the 4-run edge they would end the game with.
Stanford’s junior starting pitcher Tristan Beck was dominant, giving up just the one run on five hits in seven innings and striking out nine Trojans.
Everything that plagued the Trojans in game one only got worse on Saturday. The Cardinal blasted USC 11-1 as the third-ranked team in the nation went for a rare offensive explosion. USC junior starter Quentin Longrie started the game strong, shutting out the Cardinal and allowing only 2 hits through three innings. 
Freshman pitcher Isaac Esqueda gave up another run on a one-out double by pinch hitter Will Matthiessen in the sixth, and head coach Dan Hubbs pulled him after he walked the following batter, putting fellow freshman Brian Gursky on the mound. Esqueda picked up another earned run when Matthiessen scored on a Kuet single. Gursky gave up a score of his own on an RBI single by Cardinal shortstop Nico Hoerner. At the end of the sixth, Stanford led 5-0.
The Cardinal would double their total in the next inning to blow the game open, taking advantage of the Trojans’ freshman pitcher Riley Lamb. Stowers hit a lead-off home run. Handley scored on a fielder’s choice with the bases loaded. Two wild pitches with runners on third scored 2  more runs. Finally, Stanford junior right fielder Brian Wulff singled off of freshman John Beller to bring in another run and make the score 10-0 Stanford.
While Stanford stacked runs, its starting pitcher was shutting USC down. Kris Bubic had a perfect game through six innings until he walked Acosta in the seventh. In seven innings, he struck out six Trojans.
Again, Acosta drove in the Trojans’ only run of the day, hitting a single to score sophomore designated hitter John Thomas in the eighth. Stanford would score again in the bottom of the frame to make it 11-1.
Sunday’s game brought more of the same. Stanford wasted no time, scoring 4 runs in the first three innings, aided by two RBI singles from Wulff. The Cardinal broke the game open in the fourth; after an RBI single from center fielder Tim Tawa, Wulff again bit the Trojans with a three-run homer to center, bringing the margin to 8-0.
The Trojan pitching staff fell apart in this game. Two walks and a hit by pitch accounted for 3 of Stanford’s 5 runs in the fifth. The same thing happened in the seventh, bringing the score to a humiliating 18-0 favoring the Cardinal.
If the Trojans can take any silver linings from a series in which they were outscored 34-2, it’s that this can be a learning experience for a young team. 
The coaching staff hope that the Trojans saw the way Stanford executed and that some of that will rub off on their guys. Stanford didn’t win this series by bashing the ball around; the Cardinal only had 2 home runs in the three games. Many of their runs came off of timely hitting with runners in scoring position, taking advantage of USC’s mistakes. 
These are the things that set a team like Stanford apart from USC. The good news is that the Trojans have plenty of young talent to develop. USC’s time is yet to come, and there’s a lot of maturing to do before it reaches its full potential. If this team is resilient, it can spin this into motivation to improve for the rest of the season.

Over the weekend, the Women of Troy claimed victory against the Bears — counting for their fourth consecutive win this season. The 10-5 win marks the team’s first Pac-12 road victory.

The win against Cal advances the lacrosse team’s overall  season 6-3. The win also marks head coach Lindsey Munday’s 75th career victory. The Trojans have won five straight games over the Golden Bears.
The Trojans did not let their previous wins against Cal stop them from bringing their A-game. In the first half, the Trojans built a 7-2 lead at halftime thanks to 4 goals scored by sophomore midfielder Kerrigan Miller.
Miller matched her career high with 5 goals. In addition, she tallied three ground balls and caused two turnovers.
Miller, who has recently earned the Pac-12 women’s lacrosse offensive player of the week accolade, was a key asset in helping the Trojans end the first half strong.   
Senior goalie Gussie Johns, who has earned a Pac-12 accolade this season, posted nine saves and picked up four ground balls to go with two caused turnovers. Johns has managed to secure 84 saves this season.
The Women of Troy concluded the first half strong, mounting a 7-2 score. However, in the second half, the Trojans were scoreless for the first 15 minutes. The Golden Bears were able to score two goals to trim the USC lead to just three (7-4). 
With just minutes left in the game, the Trojans secured the victory with 2 goals courtesy of sophomore attacker Izzy McMahon and Miller. 
Following their Cal match the Women of Troy undertook Stanford on Sunday.   
The Women of Troy faced off against the Cardinal in a match that couldn’t be decided in regulation time. Both teams entered overtime with 11 goals. Ultimately, the game ended 11-12 in double overtime with Stanford claiming victory. 
Freshman midfielder Sophia Donovan, who scored the first goal just minutes into the start of the first half, was assisted by graduate student attacker Maeve McMahon. 
Junior midfielder Emily Concialdi, scored 3 goals for the Trojans. Another asset in the game against Stanford was the duo of Izzy and Maeve McMahon. Izzy scored 2 goals, while Maeve had two assists in the first half. 
The Trojans, without a doubt, were focused on both on defense and offense, concluding the first half of the game with a 1-point lead. 
With one minute left on the clock, Stanford’s sophomore midfielder, Areta Buness, scored for the Cardinal which caused the game to go into overtime.    
Last season, USC beat Stanford 15-12 securing a spot in the MPSF tournament. The Trojans’ record now stands at 6-4 on the season.
Up next, the Women of Troy will host the Golden Bears and then the Cardinal at McAlister Field for a second face off. This will allow USC to redeem themselves against the recent opponents.

Sam Arslanian | Daily Trojan
In the 2017 MLB season, baseball fans witnessed the most home runs hit in a single season in the modern era. With 6,105 dingers tallied between April 2 and Nov. 1, the players shattered the previous season’s total by nearly 500 home runs. But that magnitude of an increase isn’t the first of its kind. The 2016 season saw roughly 700 more homers than the 2015 season, which recorded about 700 more home runs than its preceding season. 
There are a lot of variables that come into play when discussing trends in baseball. The game has a unique way of naturally balancing itself out. Pitchers discover new methods of pitching that batters aren’t comfortable with, or they find a new technique to add a bit more heat to their fastball. At this point it becomes a pitching-dominant game. It isn’t until the hitters adapt to these new forms that we see the game shift back to a more hitting-dominant game.
Another element, one that the players can’t control, can have a significant impact on the game of baseball: Rule changes. In 2015 — the year we started seeing these massive increases in home run totals — the MLB’s “Pace of Play” rules were introduced. These rules limited the amount of time pitchers had between innings in an attempt to combat the increasing length of baseball games. While their intention is clear, perhaps the implementation resulted in the increase in home runs. Pitching at the  MLB level is no easy task. For many pitchers the break between innings is tough — their arm gets cold or they can get off rhythm. Rushing a proper warm-up at the start of an inning, via the Pace of Play rules, can definitely have a negative effect on pitchers.
At the end of the 2017 season, pitchers like Justin Verlander and Yu Darvish made headlines — not for their performances but for their grievances over the baseballs the MLB provided. 
“I think the main complaint is that the balls seem a little bit different in the postseason,” Verlander told USA Today. “And even from the postseason to the World Series balls. They’re a little slick. You just deal with it.”
At first, I was skeptical about this claim (and as a Tigers fan, when Verlander speaks, it’s the truth). Why would the MLB alter the balls for the postseason? It didn’t make sense. Then I watched a World Series with 22 home runs. That is ludicrous. Then, like wildfire, a slew of conspiracy theories overwhelmed the internet claiming that the MLB made the balls slicker to increase the home run count. At the time, I believed there was some weight to this claim. After all, historically, World Series ratings have been on the decline and home runs are fun to watch. 
I partially believed this theory until a couple of days ago when I read an intriguing article from Sports Illustrated’s Tom Verducci titled “Countdown to Liftoff: How Joey Gallo and Josh Donaldson Embody Baseball’s New Era.” The article focuses on a few select players who are beginning to break the norm and introduce a new approach when down in the count. 
“Hitting concepts were once passed down like stories at the Thanksgiving table, generation to generation,” Verducci said. “These outsiders have instead used technology not just to educate themselves but also to disseminate their message, guiding the celebrated midcareer breakthroughs of J.D. Martinez, Justin Turner, Josh Donaldson and Jake Marisnick — to name just a few.”
I’ve experienced this phenomenon of passed-down techniques firsthand. Every coach I’ve ever played under has told me the same words when I faced a dreaded 1-2 count: “Choke up, shorten your swing, crowd the plate and put the ball in play.” I listened to those directions. Why? Since every coach was telling me the same thing, I assumed it was just how the game is played.
Completely flipping the traditional approach, the early adopters, Donaldson, Gallo and Martinez, are now doing away with the passive approach and instead opting for a more aggressive two-strike approach. 
Someone else who has adopted this method is the Dodgers third baseman Justin Turner. Verducci quotes Turner’s frustration with the traditional method and decision to adopt a more aggressive approach from his teammate at the time, Marlon Byrd, saying, “‘Screw it. I’m going to start hitting the way [Byrd] told me.’ I go into Cleveland and I hit a home run off [Cody] Allen. Two days later, off [Danny] Salazar, I hit another homer. We go back home, and I hit some ropes off the wall in centerfield. I was feeling really good.”
Game 1 of the 2017 World Series was a thriller. The score was tied at 1 entering the sixth inning when Turner launched a 2-run bomb over the left field wall to ultimately grant the Dodgers the 3-1 win. But what separates this from any other game winning dinger is that Turner was down in the count 1-2. If you look at his swing, you can tell he wasn’t thinking “put the ball in play,” he was looking to send a missile to the outfield and he did just that. 
All the aforementioned theories could be coincidence, perhaps even a perfect storm of variables that has led to this massive increase in home runs per year. But I think there is just too much that lines up to argue against this new hitting approach. With opening day just three days away, I am eager to enter the season as a spectator with an eye out for this new approach. If this proves to be the factor that has been the catalyst for this home run increase, it will be up to the pitchers to find a solution to restore the game of baseball to its balanced state.
