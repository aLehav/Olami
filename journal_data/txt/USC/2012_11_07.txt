Though the nation excitedly anticipated the results of the 2012 presidential campaign on Election Day, California voters were waiting to hear which propositions would pass and who would be elected to state office. Most of the final results from the California propositions and legislature were announced Wednesday.
California Democrats witnessed major gains in the legislative elections. For the first time since 1883, California Democrats successfully secured a supermajority in the legislature, which has not been achieved since the Republicans held the supermajority in 1933. By securing 54 Assembly seats and 27 Senate seats, California Democrats in the legislature now hold the two-thirds majority needed to overcome filibusters.
In addition to voting on state senators and assemblymen, California voters were faced with 11 propositions ranging in topics from the death penalty to the labeling of genetically modified foods.
One of the more popular propositions on the ballot was Proposition 30, which passed with 54 percent in favor of the measure. Prop 30, supported by Gov. Jerry Brown, will increase taxes for seven years on Californians earning more than $250,000 and will increase sales taxes by 1/4 cent for four years to fund K-12 education and the UC and Cal State school systems.
The measure aims to increase state tax revenues through 2018-19, averaging at approximately $6 billion annually over the next few years. As a result of its passage, California avoids having to reduce funding to education programs in 2012-13.
In recent weeks, support for Prop. 30 fell, prompting Brown to campaign for the initiative. Sherry Bebitch Jeffe, a senior fellow at the Sol Price School of Public Policy, said the extra push was critical for the proposition’s success.
“I think, in the end, it passed because the governor got focused and began making the arguments in favor [of it],” Jeffe said. “He was the one who underscored the reality of the cuts that would have to occur if Prop. 30 did not pass.”
Though the measure aims to support education, students expressed mixed feelings about Prop. 30. Though Simone St. Claire, a freshman majoring in French, thought education should be a top priority for all voters, some of her peers did not agree.
“I am so happy that Prop. 30 passed,” said St. Claire. “But I have to say that I’m incredibly shocked that it passed at such a close margin. As a student at a private school, it doesn’t directly affect me, but a quality public education in California is still very important to me.”
Omar Hegazy, a freshman majoring in philosophy, politics and law, was also pleased that the proposition would protect K-12 education.
“I think it’s really essential for California’s educational system,” Hegazy said. “I know that my high school would have had to finish a month earlier if it didn’t pass.”
Bri Schrader, a freshman majoring in dramatic arts, opposed the measure on the grounds that it increases both sales and income taxes.
“I don’t think that they should be raising taxes in any way whatsoever,” said Schrader, a member of the USC College Republicans. “I don’t believe that the proposition allows for any immediate direction of where our money is going once they take it away from us. I’m big on small government and I think it’s just getting into our business more than it needs to.”
Proposition 32, which aimed to prevent unions from making campaign donations using deducted payroll funds, failed to pass with 56.2 percent of voters opposing the measure. Opponents of Prop. 32, primarily union and labor organizations, argued that it allowed loopholes for large corporations.
Proposition 34 aimed to repeal California’s death penalty and replace it with life imprisonment without the possibility of parole. The measure failed to pass, with 52.6 percent of Californians voting against the switch.
Another popular measure on the ballot was Proposition 37, which would have required the labeling of genetically modified foods. The measure, which projected a fiscal impact of increasing annual state costs to over $1 million to regulate the labeling of genetically engineered foods, failed to pass, with 53 percent of votes against it.
“I thought more people would want to know if the foods they’re buying are GMOs,” Hegazy said.
Though Schrader did not support the measure because of the additional cost it would have on families, she was also surprised that the measure failed.
“I heard a lot about it and I really thought that it would pass,” Schrader said. “I voted no because of money reasons.”
I was concerned that this article did not discuss how funding will also be available for California Community College students. There was a Chancellor news conference yesterday, in which the CCC Chancellor Brice Harris explained there would be $210 million headed to CCCs.

Several students said they believe new safety measures announced Tuesday by USC President C. L. Max Nikias are improvements to on-campus safety.
The new policies come after four victims sustained gunshot wounds on Oct. 31 in an on-campus shooting. The incident occurred after a suspect, not affiliated with the university, got in an argument with Geno Hall, a former Crenshaw High football star, at a Halloween party promoted by LA Hype in association with the Black Student Assembly.
The new security policies include banning outside event promoters and requiring university identification to enter campus between 9 p.m. and 6 a.m. The university also plans to increase surveillance and the number of security guards on the perimeter of campus.
Vice President for Student Affairs Michael Jackson said student groups were consulted and briefed before the changes were announced.
Several student leaders said the new changes are likely to enhance on-campus security. Mikey Geragos, Undergraduate Student Government President, said banning promoters should give student groups more oversight of their events.
“I think we are all in agreement of having party promoters on campus was probably not a good idea,” Geragos said. “When you get party promoters involved … there is always the risk they could advertise to people who they shouldn’t advertise to and you don’t have control of what’s being put out there.”
Molly Russell, a senior majoring in public relations, said she supports the policy for checking IDs to enter campus at night, but is not convinced that banning promoters will solve any safety issues on campus.
“The ID thing is huge. I think it’s a logical step that should have been taken years ago. This area is not very safe, and that’s always going to be a challenge,” Russell said. “But I don’t think the promoter thing will really help. USC is supposed to be integrated with the community, so I think it’s weird to go back on that by not allowing them to hold events.”
According to Geragos, events will still be open to individuals in the community, but USC will be checking IDs at the door.
“We wanted to make sure there was a good way to monitor [events] without excluding those guests,” Geragos said.
The university expects all new policies to be fully implemented by Jan. 14, 2013 — the first day of the spring semester.
Arya Roshanian, a sophomore majoring in vocal arts, doubts that the Dept. of Public Safety will be able to enforce the new safety measures during times when there is a high volume of students on campus.
“I’m not sure how it’s going to work with crowds,” Roshanian said. “During finals week, so many people go to campus at night to study and everything. How will they handle it when a big hoard of people is trying to get on campus?”
Nikias also said that the university will increase the amount of DPS officers stationed on campus and at campus and residence hall entrances. The banning of outside event promoters will extend to the Row.
Student Affairs consulted the Inter-Fraternity Council before announcing the changes. IFC President Michael Madden noted that the ban on promoters does not apply to party planners.
Madden said some fraternities have already started checking student IDs at the door -— a policy IFC hopes to make mandatory for all fraternities.
“That’s an idea that has been discussed and will probably be implemented next spring,” Madden said. “We are still in the process of working out the logistics of it.”
Some students, such as Sheun Alli, a junior majoring in business administration, said that staying safe is mainly up to the individual.
“People just need to be careful,” Sheun said. “The school can do whatever they want, but we’re still in South Central.”
HOW many donations has USC accepted in the last 2-3 years?  $300 million here, $25 million there… I get the idea that donations may have strings attached, stipulations as to what the money is intended for, but does it really make a difference spending $299 million on a building that the vast majority of students here CANNOT EVEN USE (seriously?) and using that extra $1 million on increasing security and other safety measures for people who actually PAY to come here and use facilities, rather than catering to a very small group of student-athletes, many of whom who are going to leave this place after 2-3 years to play for the big leagues anyway.  Not placing any blame on athletes here, but rather an administration who clearly seems to be more focused on nurturing and exploiting a very minuscule part of the student population instead of trying to keep our non-athletically-gifted students safe. But thank GOD it wasn’t Matt Barkley who got shot, or Marquise Lee; thank GOD it was ONLY a non-student who was shot FOUR TIMES in the MIDDLE OF CAMPUS.
Also, Niki-ass, thanks for sending out your statement re: the shooting to the LA Times before letting your immediate constituents, the students who live here, know anything of remote importance.
Basically Presi-dunce Niki-ass, you’re an asshole; you’re a money-hungry, fame-whoring Niki-ASS only looking for your name in the headlines so you can pleasure yourself to seeing your name in print. Have fun with that while the campus continues to get gunned down around you.
Does USC want prospective students or not? Let’s be real, no parents will allow/pay for their kids to come to or continue to go to a school in an area that is so dangerous, unless they address this complicated problem head-on, be serious!   The USC administration needs to make major changes unless they want enrollment to drop substantially.
I’m glad they came down on the Row as they have had several shootings and the Administration failed to do anything before.
Because the two are definitely mutually exclusive.  Don’t blame the University for cracking down on the Row, blame the Row itself.  It has been embarrassing USC for years.
And don’t even start with “they failed to do anything before.”  The administration added the yellowjackets a few years ago, they’ve increased DPS patrols, LAPD has increased its presence around USC (for better or worse), and the administration responded quickly and decisively when an on-campus shooting happened.

Graduate Student Government held its first town hall meeting Wednesday night, where students got the chance to interact with a panel of university officials who answered questions concerning graduate students.
Panelists · Vice Provost for Graduate Programs Sally Pratt and Vice President for Student Affairs Michael Jackson respond to questions about graduate students’ needs. – Priyanka Patel | Daily Trojan
Panelists included Dept. of Public Safety Chief Carey Drayton, Senior Associate Dean of Students Lynette Merriman, Vice Provost for Graduate Programs Sally Pratt and Vice President for Student Affairs Michael Jackson.
The 20 graduate students who attended the meeting discussed issues ranging from security to financial aid with the panelists.
Drayton emphasized that the department’s primary goal is to ensure the safety of university students. He said he supported the new policies that make the University Park Campus a closed campus between 9 p.m. and 6 a.m., following the shooting incident on campus last week.
“We’re not building walls, but we’re putting things in a different sort of light than we have before,” Drayton said. “So things change and coming through campus is one thing that is going to change.”
Current national issues affecting university policies were also discussed, particularly the Supreme Court case of Fisher v. University of Texas, regarding a college’s right to use affirmative action with decisions regarding student admittance.
Jackson defended the university’s policy of holistic review, stating he personally benefited from affirmative action.
“USC’s committed to providing access to folks who historically might have been denied access to an institution like USC,” Jackson said. “We want other students of color to have access to these schools.”
Recognizing that this diversity at the university creates a wide range of graduate students to support, all of the representatives present on the panel stressed they were advocates for students pursuing their master’s degrees.
“My job is making sure USC is a welcoming environment that allows students to flourish, and we are responsible to both undergraduate and graduate student needs,” Jackson said.
Pratt recognized the difference between addressing undergraduate and graduate students, and assured town hall members that the university has resources for graduate students.
“Undergraduate students are most like each other,” Pratt said. “However, graduate students are very focused on a given set of things. All graduate studies are hard and are built on stress. I’m interested in working with all constituents to find out what graduate students’ needs [are].”
Tiffany De Leon Avalos, a first year graduate student in the Rossier School of Education, believes town halls help build connections among graduate students while creating an outlet to address shared concerns.
“Because graduate school is complex and we all are focused on our own studies, these meetings give us the opportunity to foster a community and feel that there is an agency advocating for us,” De Leon Avalos said.
The Graduate Student Government hopes to continue connecting graduate students across diverse fields together throughout the year. Graduate Student Government has planned several social and professional events for graduate students to foster this sense of community.
“We are the voice of and advocate for students, especially since graduate students are very internally focused,” said GSG President Yael Adef, a graduate student in the USC School of Social Work. “We want to break down any barriers that may exist.”

Despite the USC women’s soccer team’s run-of-the-mill 2012 record of 6-10-3, the Women of Troy competed hard throughout the season, ending on a high note with a thrilling 3-2 overtime victory over UCLA.
Building block · Jordan Marada, who led the Women of Troy with 15 points in 2012, will provide next year’s squad with a dangerous scorer. – Chris Roman | Daily Trojan
The Women of Troy entered the season with 20 of their 34 players making their USC debuts as either freshmen or transfers. The team still retained a veteran presence, however, with seven of its 11 goal scorers from 2011 returning, including junior midfielder Elizabeth Eddy, who led the team last year with four goals — two of which were game-winners.
USC’s 3-6-2 record in Pac-12 play placed it seventh in the conference. The team also missed the NCAA tournament for the second consecutive year after not missing postseason play since 2004.
Though lacking in experience, almost all of the Women of Troy’s games went down to the wire. Perhaps no statistic exemplifies this more than the fact that they played nine overtime games — in which they went 2-4-3 — and that 16 of USC’s 19 games were decided by a one-goal margin or less. The Women of Troy were only outscored 34-27 on the season.
The women’s soccer team began the season 2-1 for the first time since 2008, winning both its season and home openers, including a 4-1 win over Saint Mary’s on Aug. 24. It was the team’s highest scoring home opener since 2007, when USC’s championship season began with a 5-1 win over Weber State. The Women of Troy followed that up with a 1-3-1 stretch before entering conference play, only scoring six goals in that span.
After starting off conference play with a 1-0 win against Washington, USC went winless in its next five games — including two ties —  before snapping that streak as well as a 258-minute scoreless streak against Utah.
USC appeared to step its game up against some of the best teams in the nation, as the team closed out its schedule against No. 1 Stanford, No. 21 California and No. 2 UCLA.
The team would have pulled off a major upset against Stanford if not for an offsides call overturning the game-winning goal, allowing the Cardinal to seal the 1-0 win. Similarly, USC fought California evenly until Cal took advantage of a defensive miscue to beat USC 1-0. Thankfully, their season-ending win over UCLA gives them some momentum heading into next season.
The Women of Troy only lose five seniors next season and will bring in some new recruits to strengthen their young core. Samantha Johnson earned Pac-12 Offensive Player of the Week honors after scoring her 15th career goal (10th most by a Trojan) against UCLA  and also snagged a 2012 All-Pac-12 Honorable Mention. Johson and junior midfielder Jordan Marada notched five goals apiece on the season to pace the Women of Troy. Meanwhile, freshman Jamie Fink earned a spot on the Pac-12 All-Freshman Team, while Marada ultimately led the team in points with 15.
USC had a slight improvement in winning percentage after a 7-14-0 record in 2011 (from .333 to .395), and all the experience in close games over an entire season should help prepare the Women of Troy for next season as they look to get back into the NCAA picture.

Once Matt Barkley announced last December that he would be returning to USC for his senior season, he immediately became the favorite to win the Heisman Trophy.
But on the first play of scrimmage during the Trojans’ season, sophomore wide receiver Marqise Lee gave a sign of what was to come, catching a screen pass, juking two Hawai’i defenders and galloping 75 yards down the sideline for a touchdown.
It looked like the beginning of another beautiful season for Barkley and Lee, but only the latter has lived up to the lofty expectations placed on him.
While Barkley has been bearing the brunt of the blame in the national media for the Trojans’ three losses, Lee has been putting up video-game numbers, and is now USC’s best candidate for the school’s first Heisman winner since Reggie Bush won the award in 2005.
USC’s athletic department has taken notice of this turn of events — on Wednesday, it shifted its focus to Lee’s candidacy by releasing a two-minute YouTube video that begins with the question, “Who is the best player in college football?”
The video goes on to display Lee’s season highlights, subtitled with his eye-popping stats and quotes from opposing coaches.
“Marqise Lee may be the best receiver I’ve had the opportunity to coach against,” Oregon coach Chip Kelly is quoted as saying. He later continued to declare that Lee is “impressive on film, but even more impressive when you watch him in person.”
“He’s not an NFL prospect, he’s an NFL for sure,” UCLA coach Jim Mora said. “He can start in the NFL right now.”
USC coach Lane Kiffin says gushing comments from rival coaches will end up holding more credence than anything he could say about his star wideout.
“As a head coach, you’re always gonna say good things about your stars,” Kiffin said. “When other people are making statements like that, I think that should be more powerful than a video being sent out or numbers being sent out.”
Still, Lee’s numbers are mighty impressive.
The flanker leads the nation with 88 receptions and 2,007 all-purpose yards, and is second in receiving yards (1,286) and third in touchdowns (12).
In the past two weeks alone, he’s racked up 28 receptions, 502 receiving yards and 877 all-purpose yards.
“It’s unusual for a receiver to have the type of numbers that he’s having,” Kiffin said. “I didn’t have anything to do with the production of the video, but it’d be hard to argue that he’s not playing as well as anybody in America.”
Heisman pundits have somewhat taken notice of Lee’s accomplishments, but as of now, he probably won’t be invited to New York as one of the five Heisman finalists.
On ESPN’s Heisman Watch released Tuesday, Lee was ranked seventh. Kansas State’s Collin Klein garnered 13 out of 15 first-place votes, while Oregon’s Kenjon Barner and Alabama’s AJ McCarron tallied one first-place vote each and finished second and third, respectively.
There are a few disadvantages that Lee will have to overcome to claim the coveted award, the first  being the position he plays.
It’s been over 20 years since a receiver last won the Heisman — Michigan’s Desmond Howard was the last to do so in 1991. Only three wideouts have won the trophy in its 77-year history, and the last 14 winners have been either quarterbacks or running backs.
“He doesn’t get as much touches as a running back would, or a quarterback would,” Kiffin said.
But the biggest obstacle standing in Lee’s way? The number three. As in the amount of losses USC has already suffered this season.
Out of the nine players listed on ESPN’s Heisman Watch, Lee is the only one to play on a team with more than two losses.
In fact, six of the candidates — Klein, Barner, McCarron, Notre Dame’s Manti Te’o, Ohio State’s Braxton Miller and Louisville’s Teddy Bridgewater — have yet to experience the agony of defeat this season.
Kiffin thinks Lee’s record-breaking game (345 receiving yards) against Arizona two weeks ago lost some of its luster because of the team’s subsequent defeats.
“You have some historical performances coming out of [Barkley] and Marqise that are being missed,” Kiffin said. “We always tell our players, ‘The more games you win, the more awards come.’”
If that’s true, then it doesn’t really matter if Lee continues to stockpile receptions, all-purpose yards and touchdowns.
Unfortunately, if we don’t see the Trojans in Pasadena for the Rose Bowl come January, then we won’t see Lee in New York, either.

Somehow, like a hot knife  through butter, senior quarterback Matt Barkley’s pass sliced  two Oregon defensive backs and landed in the hands of Nelson Agholor.
Five star · Despite playing alongside superstars Marqise Lee and Robert Woods, Nelson Agholor has 14 receptions for 269 yards this season. – Sean Roth | Daily Trojan
The freshman wide receiver held on as Ducks cornerback Avery Patterson screamed in for a pummeling hit.
“I was standing on the sideline,” wide receivers coach Tee Martin said, “thinking he was going to get his helmet knocked off.”
His helmet stayed on — Agholor slipped the incoming Patterson and in a flash sprinted into the end zone to cap a 76-yard touchdown haul, the first scoring play of his short nine-game college career.
“He made a great catch, great concentration, caught it and kept running with it,” Martin added.
The highlight reel play served as the exclamation point on Agholor’s breakout performance versus Oregon last Saturday, a game where he finished with six receptions for 162 yards and one touchdown.
“It felt good to just help my teammates out,” Agholor said. “There’s an opportunity given to me every week, and whether the ball comes to me or not, I just have to make plays.”
His first big play came in mid-September at Stanford on a 49-yard reception. This time, though, he punched it in for six points.
And should he continue making plays, USC’s opponents will have a third dynamic wideout to worry about in the Tampa, Fla. native.
On the season, Agholor has caught 14 passes for 269 yards, including his touchdown Saturday.
And his latest performance suggests some sort of a late-season rise similar to that of his predecessors, sophomore Marqise Lee and junior Robert Woods, who notched impressive freshman campaigns of their own — each was named the conference’s offensive freshman of the year.
“He’s starting to catch on, right around the same time as Marqise and Robert did,” Barkley said. “It’s taken him a couple games to get into that rhythm and to get that confidence. He’s known what to do for a while now, but he finally got a chance on some of those deeper balls.”
Agholor, though, hasn’t been thinking about those deep balls, not that much anyway. Oddly enough, he’s been thinking about a botched onside kick during the waning minutes against Oregon — when he had a chance to recover the ball but took the wrong angle of pursuit.
“That’s discipline, that’s something I can control,” Agholor said. “We’ve actually coached that up many times, and I let emotions take me away from my fundamentals. I tried to chase the ball, rather than hug the sidelines.”
Discipline and fundamentals, combined with talent, is what has allowed Agholor, a five-star recruit coming from Berkeley Prep, to make an impact through nine games with the No. 19 Trojans thus far.
In the words of Martin, his position coach, it’s because of the “formula.”
“When you’re talented, you work hard, and you’re prepared on Saturday, you’re going to produce,” Martin said. “That’s the formula. He has those three attributes. … He cares about knowing what to do and he wants to be great.”
So his latest effort wasn’t all that surprising. It was expected.
Asked if Aghlor’s touchdown reception was a pass most freshmen could make, Martin just smiled.
“I’m glad that one made it.”

When the USC men’s basketball team took on UCLA in the opening round of the Pac-12 tournament last March, USC coach Kevin O’Neill had one player taller than 6-foot-6 at his disposal — center James Blasczyk.
Extra leg room · If Rice transfer Omar Oraby’s hardship waiver is granted by the NCAA, Oraby will pair with senior James Blasczyk (31) to give USC two 7-footers in its regular rotation. – Chris Pham | Daily Trojan
As the last remaining big man on the roster, the already-hobbled junior logged only 12 minutes of playing time in a 55-40 defeat. The Trojans’ season came to a merciful ending without the two frontcourt players that had started the year, as forward Aaron Fuller and center Dewayne Dedmon both went down to major injuries at different points during USC’s 6-26 campaign.
What a difference a few months make.
USC enters the 2012-13 season with a healthy, deep frontcourt. O’Neill, the Trojans’ fourth-year coach, has yet to weigh in on who will fill the forward and center spots, but junior big man Dedmon figures to be in position for a fair amount of playing time after averaging 23 minutes per game last year.
Dedmon worked on becoming a more complete player in the offseason and will be counted on as an important defender and rebounder for the Trojans.
“I just worked on my all-around game,” Dedmon said. “Also just keeping up the high intensity and pace. Rebounding was a big thing I wanted to focus on.”
Blasczyk, a senior center, will also be returning for the Trojans and should see time as a role player who could give the Trojans extra depth in the paint.
“Knock on wood, I’m completely healthy for the first time in five years,” Blasczyk said. “I bring energy and I play hard. I do the things that nobody else likes to do.”
Perhaps the biggest X-factor in the frontcourt stands 7-foot-2 in junior center Omar Oraby, who recently transferred from Rice. The Trojans have yet to hear from the NCAA as to whether or not the big man will be eligible for the start of the season after he applied for a hardship waiver to play immediately.
But if he is allowed to suit up, USC will have three legitimate seven-footers on the roster.
“It helps our defense because when you’ve got that much length in a college game down low, it’s hard to score on us,” O’Neill said. “We’re a trap-the-box team, so when guys trap the box with a seven-foot length versus a six- foot-seven [length], there’s a big difference.”
Oraby broke Rice’s blocks record with 54 in just 11.6 minutes per game, but has been impressing teammates in practice for more than just his defensive abilities.
“Omar at 7-foot-2 has been able to do a lot of things that I don’t think we were expecting, especially this soon,” senior point guard Jio Fontan said.
Meanwhile, senior forward Aaron Fuller returns from a torn labrum after putting up 10.6 points and 5.9 rebounds per game in 2011-12.
He led the team in the latter department last year and figures to get plenty of action at the power forward spot.
“I used the summer time to get back basketball-wise, a lot of rehab and stuff,” Fuller said. “I was cleared in August so since then it’s been getting better each and every day. It’ll get a lot better as the year goes on.”
Strahinja Gavrilovic, a 6-foot-9 freshman who O’Neill has affectionately nicknamed “Luis” for short, gives USC another big body off the bench.
“When one of us gets tired, we have a bunch of guys that can come off the bench,” Fuller said. “From the first guy to the last guy, we can all contribute.”
USC also boasts a trio of versatile forwards each standing at least 6-foot-6 that can stuff the stat sheet on any given night. Renaldo Woolridge, a senior transfer from Tennessee, stands at 6-foot-9 but specializes in shooting beyond the arc — he scored 17 points, including five 3-pointers, against Anthony Davis and the No. 1 ranked Kentucky Wildcats last season.
“My biggest [skill] is probably my three-point shooting and my experience, having played for four years,” Woolridge said.
Junior forward Ari Stewart, a transfer from Wake Forest following his freshman year, is also set to jump into the fray after having to sit out last season. He averaged 8.5 points and 4.4 rebounds as a sophomore.
“Ari Stewart’s an athlete who can guard … two through four,” Fontan said. “And he’s a dead spot shooter, so he’s going to be able to stretch the floor for us.”
Another transfer, senior Eric Wise from UC Irvine, brings a unique skill set as a 6-foot-6 forward who can create for his teammates.
Wise averaged 16.3 points and 8.1 rebounds in 20 games for the Anteaters during the 2010-11 season.
“Eric Wise is probably the most versatile guy on our team, so he stands out,” Fontan said. “He’s probably the best playmaker on our team other than myself and JT [Terrell].”
How O’Neill chooses to utilize his new group of forwards and centers remains up in the air, but he’s encouraged by what he’s seen so far.
“I really like our frontline,” O’Neill said. “We’ve got a lot of options. We’ve got veteran players, we’ve got hard playing guys. If you throw Omar into that group, you’re talking about a really, really good frontline.”

As Disney put it, Beauty and the Beast is a tale as old as time.
Since its incarnation as a French fairy tale in 1740, the romantic story of a lovely maiden and a disfigured monster has seen several screen, theatrical and literary adaptations, the most popular of which came in the form of the 1991 Disney film and the 1987 television show staring Linda Hamilton and Ron Perlman.
So perhaps fans of the unusual love story weren’t surprised when the CW announced that it was doing its own interpretation of the classic tale. The network unveiled the new show, titled Beauty and the Beast, on Oct. 11 to generally negative critical reviews.
CW’s adaptation sets a fairy-tale narrative against an urban Manhattan landscape, where Detective Catherine Chandler (Kristin Kreuk) struggles to uncover the mystery behind her mother’s death. As a teenager, Catherine witnessed the death of her mother at the hands of two mysterious gunmen just moments before being rescued by a “mysterious beast.” Ten years later, as she works on a particularly unusual case, she stumbles across a clue that leads her to superhuman Vincent Keller (Jay Ryan), her savior and the result of a military science project gone wrong.
At its core, the CW’s Beauty and the Beast blends multiple genres, but only succeeds in a few of them. There’s the not-so-subtle forbidden romance between Catherine and Vincent, the myriad of Catherine’s detective cases found in the typical crime show and the science fiction/action-thriller nature of Vincent’s mysterious military background. With so many narrative styles crammed into an hour-long show, Beauty and the Beast appears confused and unsure of itself.
This seems especially true considering pop culture’s recent obsession with fantasy. At first glance, it appeared that, with Beauty and the Beast, the CW was attempting to capitalize on the large fairy-tale market brought about by the likes of successful programs such as Once Upon A Time and Grimm. But instead of bringing a new approach to familiar tales in the style of Once Upon A Time — whose innovative story hinges on the connection between the modern and the enchanted world — the CW merely regurgitated a tired concept. Adaptations such as the 2011 film Beastly and the 1987 Beauty and the Beast already featured the fairy-tale narrative against an urban backdrop, and though the CW marketed the show as a remake of the 1987 program, it would have been nice to see a fresher take on the timeless story.
But there’s another problem with the CW’s latest television program: Beauty and the Beast is essentially Twilight — minus the sparkling vampires.
Personal opinions on the Twilight saga aside, viewers of the CW’s Beauty and the Beast will notice striking parallels between Vincent and author Stephanie Meyer’s Edward Cullen. From subtle details like the upturned collar on Vincent’s trademark peacoat to the fierce golden blaze in his eyes on CW advertisements, Vincent reeks of Robert Pattinson’s Edward.
The similarities to Twilight don’t end with physical connections between Vincent and Edward, however. Scenes between Catherine and Vincent seem almost directly pulled from a chapter of Twilight or Eclipse. Much like the way Edward constantly frets about the state of his soul, Vincent spends several episodes trying to convince himself that he is not a monster and is capable of being around Catherine without killing her. Given Vincent’s medical background — he worked as a doctor before joining the military after his brothers were killed in 9/11 — his interest in saving the citizens of Manhattan seem highly plausible. Still, the show’s ever-present focus on themes of guilt and duty seem a little too timely, especially given the release of the final chapter of the Twilight saga, Breaking Dawn Part 2, later this month. Here, it seems the CW is attempting to capitalize on the Twilight market as well.
But a series of poor stylistic choices also extend to the more original elements of the show: Namely, the CW doesn’t seem to understand the darker, more profound nature of the fairy tale. As the original story and later adaptations suggest, Beauty learns to love the Beast by looking past his hideousness. But by casting the attractive, well-built Ryan in the role of Vincent, the CW misses the main theme of its source of inspiration.
A tiny scar on Ryan’s right cheek serves as the only physical deformity of the character, and though Vincent transforms Hulk-style into a raging beast, shaky, blurred cinematography and intentionally accelerated editing prevent the viewer from getting a good glimpse of Vincent in his monstrous state. Perhaps ignoring the ugly nature of the Beast’s character would work if Vincent’s personality served as his hideousness, but — just as Twilight fans never believed Edward would hurt Bella — viewers don’t quite believe that Vincent is capable of the violent acts the government accuses him of. In short, the new show features two beauties rather than a beauty and a beast.
Still, the show contains a few highlights.
Kreuk, whom fans might recognize from her role as Lana Lang in Smallville, will hold your attention with her onscreen charisma and striking facial features. Despite comments from critics that suggest Kreuk’s petite stature renders her incapable of holding her own against Beauty and the Beast’s baddies (all government agents trained to kill) the actress emanates a quiet but perceptible strength. Even in the poorly choreographed fight scenes, it’s clear Catherine’s channeled rage from her mother’s unjust death, and perhaps even some martial arts training of her own, compensate for her smaller physical size.
Beauty and the Beast also features compelling, though not overly-complex, criminal mysteries. Though it’s clear that the show has settled into a rigid format — a crime is committed within the first 15 minutes of the episode, before Vincent and Catherine spend the remaining 45 attempting to figure out “whodunit” — the crimes featured so far aren’t terribly predictable. They also often involve a host of minor characters, just enough to throw off the viewer’s intuition if they thought they’d figured out the mystery ahead of time.
If watching Vincent and Catherine fall in love gets boring, the amusing detective story makes an episode, if not the entire season, worth watching.
What’s most disappointing about Beauty and the Beast, however, is that the show fails to take advantage of an audience ready for another solid fairy-tale adaptation. Given the prevalence of the beauty and the beast story in cultural staples such as The Phantom of the Opera, the CW could have easily taken a popular story and translated it to the small screen. Instead, the network fails to make the most of the tale’s complex nature and ultimately delivers something shallow and ghastly.
 
CW’s Beauty and the Beast airs Thursdays at 9 p.m.
Despite the problems you’ve mentioned, I think Beauty and the Beast looks like an interesting show. I haven’t managed to check it out yet because I’ve been working extra hours at DISH, but I plan to. I set the series to record on my DISH Hopper, which has enough memory to save the entire season, so it will be easy for me to watch it from the beginning whenever I have time. And from what I’ve heard, the series isn’t bad. The two lead actors are supposed to be very good, and the show was just picked up for a full season, so it will be sticking around for a while.
I second Dee and Debby’s comments.  I’m beginning to wonder about all these unfairly negative reviews about the show when the same criticisms could be made of so many others that have been a wild success (esp. on the CW).  BATB seems to have been singled out for pure meanness.  I will continue to watch regardless.
I agree with Dee, the show has good chemistry and I love the show. The writer of the article is COLD. I am anxious for tonights show.
As an actual fan of the show I can readily admit its faults. The writer of this article has obviously not dedicated too much time to research. Otherwise, they would have realized that the show’s so-called “criminal mysteries” are its weakest attempt, at best. The crimes are extremely predictable and though they serve as a reason to cause Kristin’s character to spend her time productively, the crimes are mostly there to serve one purpose- a lesson learned. What makes me want to watch is the chemistry between the two leads and the complexity of the characters in general. There is room for story in all the characters they’ve created and that alone can make a story exciting. Fresher take? It may have originally been marketed as a remake of the 1987 version (their mistake) but this show is anything but that. Going into its fifth episode the show is starting to stand on its own.

When The Learning Channel began airing episodes for its new show Virgin Diaries, I — like many others — sat agape. Who knew that people like “Skip,” the overweight close-to-middle-aged virgin who lived in his mother’s basement and collected his belly button lint — seriously, he has jars of the stuff — still existed?
Perhaps it’s the fact that we go to one of the largest and rowdiest party schools on the planet or the fact that the younger generations seem to get sluttier and sluttier with each year, but the idea of a virgin is something that some students have trouble grasping.
Years ago, sex was saved for marriage. Nowadays, it seems like sex is saved for the first person you run into at a house party on Menlo.
Think about it: When you hear that someone is a virgin, you might think to yourself, “Really?” as if it was a rare condition that only the ugliest and weirdest of humans retain. “If no one wants to sleep with you, there must be something wrong.”
Now I must admit that the above statement is certainly a generalization. There are plenty of ’SC students who are not sex-crazed animals and completely understand the reasons for one deciding to remain a virgin. Yet it’s impossible to ignore the strange backlash that many virgins receive.
But that would only be an issue if today’s virgin didn’t go through such a dramatic transformation. Say goodbye to the diminutive, austere virgin of yesteryear — the 21st century virgin is a force to be reckoned with. Though some still fit the stereotype of a Bible-wielding puritan, there has been a rise of young girls and guys who are in no rush to get between the sheets, yet also have no problem having the time of their lives.
As one student, who wished to remain anonymous, stated, “I drink on Thursday nights, dance at frats, flirt with guys, have an extremely close group of girl friends, and study when I need to. I’m not the stereotypical virgin; I’m just me.”
And she’s not alone. The number of virgins (and proud ones at that) is unexpectedly high. In some places, virginity is a closely guarded secret, almost like it was a medical condition. At my high school, students could not wait to finally be rid of the burden of being labeled a virgin, and I’ve found that in college, there might be a large amount of virgins still strolling around our campus, but the only difference is: They don’t care.
This sort of confidence is what blurs the line between the cardboard stereotype that virgins are often relegated to, and the image of the new “Sexy Virgin.” You might think that the girl you’re hitting on at the 9-0 or the guy you spot on campus is down for a hook up, but in today’s day and age, you can’t tell a virgin by simply looking at them. Chances are they’re the hot girls in your sorority, or the cute guy from your GE class.
One student, who’s even a member of a sorority, is a severe clash of the virgin stereotype, “I think people view the typical virgin as someone who’s never been on a date and whose big event each week is church on Sunday. I have had three boyfriends and sleep at my boyfriend’s place almost once a week. You’d never know all we do is sleep.”
But why are these students still virgins? And notice how I said “still.” Why is virginity a plague that we want gone? An inauspicious burden on our backs?
These students’ reasons range from body-image issues (“I am not very comfortable with my body”) to religious beliefs (“I am Catholic so I feel I am definitely more conservative”) to health reasons (“Having OCD and having sex just don’t really go well together”) to wanting to start relationships off on the right note (“I just don’t want to start a relationship purely off of the physical aspect”). But there are also those who don’t feel pressured by their families or communities to remain virginal. They simply chose to do so.
“I still have my virginity simply because I have not found the right person or time,” one student claimed.  “I’m not waiting for fireworks or my Prince Charming to sweep me off my feet; however, I am waiting to feel something real with someone. I simply have not found that person yet, and I am in no hurry to find him.”
This sort of thinking is one that copious students lack around campus. How many times have you passed by a girl crying about some guy she thought was “the one”? Sorry, but if he took you back to his place and then kicked you out in the morning, chances are he isn’t going to call.
What virgins are able to do is protect themselves from the petty sexual drama that happens regularly. As sex is such a personal, intimate act, instead of focusing on cultivating real relationships, sex starts to dictate feelings.
“A lot of people take sex lightly and consider it something that is very normal for people to do in college.” One student said. “I have seen many people get hurt because they had sex with someone and became emotionally attached even though it meant nothing but a drunken hook-up.”
And as much as the other half of the population hates to admit it, that student is right. Sex is taken extremely lightly at this school. But that’s OK. What people need to realize is that judging others for their personal decisions is not the route to take. One needs to be respectful of whatever another person’s choices are, even if we do not agree with them.
Virgins sometimes lose friends, romantic interests, and more when their little secret is found out. But a lot of the time, they also gain respect.
Virgins are not all like Skip, our Virgin Diaries hero. No: They’re straight, gay, female, male, young, old, rich, poor and everything in between. So look around you and see if you can spot one.
But even if you can, they couldn’t care less.

In a small, dimly lit room on the second floor of the Los Angeles County Museum of Art’s Ahmanson Building, deceptive pieces of art entrance viewers.
Though at first glance the displayed photographs look like Greek classical nudes, they soon reveal themselves to be more akin to images out of a bondage and sado-masochism photoshoot.
Bowed beauty · Known for photos that celebrate the human body, Robert Mapplethorpe captures small details like skin texture in his works. This photo, Cedric, N.Y.C. (X Portfolio), is one of the pieces on display at LACMA. – | Photo courtesy of LACMA
One of LACMA’s newest exhibitions, “Robert Mapplethorpe: XYZ” offers an intimate look into three portfolios by the late American photographer Robert Mapplethorpe. Mapplethorpe’s work, known for its controversial, sexually charged images, met with mixed reviews over the photographer’s lifetime.
The exhibition reflects three subjects Mapplethorpe focused on throughout his career: floral still life, homosexual sadomasochistic acts and nude portraits of African-American men. Though the subject matter of the exhibition might initially shock viewers, a prolonged stay and an open mind reveal a world where the beauty of human sexuality is displayed through Mapplethorpe’s honest portrayal of the human body.
The exhibition opens with three displayed prefaces, each published in one of the portfolios on display, titled X, Y and Z. These prefaces, which include a poem by Paul Schmidt, a prose-like poem by Patti Smith and an essay by Edmund White, immediately establish the intimate nature of the exhibit.
These photographs are not just frank portrayals of subjects’ sexuality — they also offer a look into the mind of Mapplethorpe, whose conceptions of beauty have often been at odds with what are considered appropriate artistic subjects. It is fitting that these three prefaces are displayed in the beginning, for they expand the purpose of the exhibition into one that focuses not just on Mapplethorpe’s imagery, but on Mapplethorpe’s beliefs as well.
The photographs themselves reveal the delicacy of the human body as well as its strength. Mapplethorpe focuses on aspects of the human body, such as the texture of skin and muscle definition, that reveal the body’s paradoxical nature. Mapplethorpe’s subjects are at once vulnerable and powerful, revealing the fragile sensuality of the human body as well as its raw, powerful sexuality.
The nudity within the images contributes to this complexity as well. Many of Mapplethorpe’s subjects are photographed while in the middle of a sexual act. Though many might decry these images as degrading, it becomes clear that being photographed in this manner becomes empowering for the subjects.
Mapplethorpe achieves this through the utilization of light to create a hyper-realistic quality that shows the curved lines of muscle definition and the impeccable smoothness of his subjects’ skin. By paying attention to these details, Mapplethorpe allows the subjects participating in these sexual acts to transgress the initial shock value of what they are doing  and to become part of an image that celebrates human sexuality.
Many of Mapplethorpe’s images are also notable for their use of pedestals. By placing his subjects on pedestals, as well as photographing them in black and white, Mapplethorpe likens his subjects to classical Greek nude sculptures. In essence, Mapplethorpe’s photographs celebrate the beauty of the human form and the beauty inherent in sexual acts.
But Mapplethorpe doesn’t photograph his subjects in traditional poses that are commonly associated with portraiture. Instead, subjects are photographed engaged in physical acts, usually with a portion of their body cut off or hidden in shadow. Through this technique, Mapplethorpe isolates certain portions of the human body, rendering a surreal atmosphere within the image. Further, by placing his subjects within abstract backgrounds, Mapplethorpe elevates his subjects into a realm that is appropriate for their unearthly beauty.
Still, Mapplethorpe’s subjects are not gods. They are not specific entities intended to be worshipped by the viewer. Instead they represent the beauty of the human body’s capabilities. The men, photographed with such care, allow a glimpse into the mind of Mapplethorpe, a man who seeks to show the beauty in sexual interactions that have long been considered shameful and immoral.
Understandably, Mapplethorpe’s work has yet to avoid criticism. The frank portrayal of nudity and sexual acts, as well as Mapplethorpe’s focus on African-American men, has given critics grounds for dismissing Mapplethorpe’s work as exploitative.
After looking through Mapplethorpe’s photographs, however, what emerges is not the exploitation of African-American bodies for sensation or profit, but rather,  the realization of Mapplethorpe’s belief in the beauty of the human body, especially the African-American body, and a desire to photograph people in a way that grants them power and agency over their image.
Indeed, it is the gaze of Mapplethorpe’s subjects that stay with the viewer long after leaving the exhibition. When Mapplethorpe chooses to photograph a subject that is looking at the camera, the look is never of shame, fear or blatant sexuality. Instead, it is always a combination of pride, of curiosity and of an awareness of the ability of the subject’s body to transgress its physicality into the most abstract conceptions of beauty.
 
“Robert Mapplethorpe: XYZ” runs until March 24, 2013.
eye for detail that makes the subject more human than that of a more power image of which the body is clothed with color

As news outlets started calling the election for President Barack Obama on Tuesday night, I couldn’t help feeling like we could have called it a long time ago. Even if Republican Mitt Romney hadn’t had such a clumsy campaign, it’s become increasingly rare for an incumbent president to lose, especially an unchallenged one. And Obama is relatively well liked; people might have started questioning more of his decisions as the possibility of a Romney presidency became more real, but for the most part, he retained a significant amount of support from his 2008 campaign.
Kate Wong | Daily Trojan
Why, then, did it seem like the election came down to the wire? Throughout the campaign and up until Election Day, the media sensationalized what would have otherwise been a straightforward election and let partisan politics negatively affect good, sound journalism. News publications shouldn’t sacrifice journalistic integrity for the sake of more exciting stories, especially concerning such a significant event.
This doesn’t just concern Election Day, either; careless and sensationalist journalism remained a problem throughout the campaign. Look at the coverage of the first debate. News publications weren’t focusing on the fact that many of the candidates’ claims, especially their economic policies and statistics, were often speculative or false. They instead overanalyzed Romney’s Big Bird comment and took the debate as an opportunity to tell a comeback story. The media took Romney’s best performance and spun it as if he had changed the nature of the election in his favor, although Obama ended up with almost 100 more electoral votes than Romney.
This kind of sensationalism goes both ways, however. According to a Pew Research Center study, 72 percent of campaign coverage over a 10-week period was negative for Obama and 71 percent was negative for Romney. The media’s narrow focus on gaffes, partisanship and trivial stories led Americans to focus on the wrong aspects of the election; where publications should have been fact checking and reporting on campaign events, they entertained readers with meaningless but superficially controversial stories.
Take, for example, the Pennsylvania voting machine that wouldn’t allow voters to select Obama’s name. A man took a reportedly unaltered video of himself selecting Obama, only for Romney’s name to be highlighted. This was a mistake that briefly prevented someone from voting, but it should hardly be news: The machine was later recalibrated and returned to service. The story, however, was reported by NBC, The Washington Post and The Huffington Post. It doesn’t matter if these publications claim foul play was involved or not; they aren’t reporting about a broken voting machine, they’re spreading a story in which Obama is portrayed as a victim.
This is not to say that all election coverage was done poorly — especially toward the end of Tuesday night, most major news stations were releasing accurate and up-to-date information. And even during the candidates’ campaigns, there were plenty of fact-checkers and reliable sources serving as a counternarrative to the divided and distracted media.
But the good journalism gets lost, and what sticks out most are over-quoted slips of the tongue and entertaining rumors. Romney’s 47 percent comment and Obama’s comparison of battleships to bayonets received far more attention than they should have, and speculation on the online political forum Democratic Underground that Romney had applied a fake tan before his interview with Latino television station Univision was quoted by publications as prominent as Gawker and The Huffington Post.
The role of news in politics should be first and foremost providing information. When publications sloppily report on an event as important as the presidential election, they risk misinforming voters. As the link between voters and candidates, media is an essential part of politics — journalists need to keep in mind what constitutes actual reporting.

President Barack Obama clinched re-election Tuesday night in a decisive victory over Republican candidate Mitt Romney, ending a race deemed historic in many ways. The results of the election, from a record number of women elected to Senate to the very re-election of a black president, indicates just how much the political and social faces of America are changing. But above all, the election demonstrates how politicians and citizens alike must unite under this new America, together rather than divided.
There is no doubt that America is transforming, moving toward record levels of tolerance and equality. The election results confirm the stirring change taking place.
For one, Wisconsin’s Tammy Baldwin became the first openly gay senator to be elected into office. Gay marriage was legalized in Maine, Maryland and Washington, the first time voters had approved the measure by popular vote after defeat in 32 states over the years.
Joining Tammy Baldwin in office are 19 other women, a record number compared to the current 17 women in the Senate. Democrat Elizabeth Warren became the first female senator in Massachusetts. Republican Deb Fischer became the first full-term female senator of Nebraska. In Hawaii, Democrat Mazie Hirono beat Linda Lingle, becoming the first Asian-American woman in the Senate. And New Hampshire takes the trophy, electing an all-woman Congressional delegation. It’s mindblowing to think how far the government has come from 20 years ago, when 1992 was deemed the “Year of the Woman” with a record of six females garnering Senate seats.
A glance at Obama’s own political success illustrates an evolving, more tolerant America. An obscure African-American senator from Illinois only a few years ago, Obama is now a two-term president. His re-election demonstrates that though racism still exists, it is waning steadily.
On the other side of the race, the Republicans, defeated in a hard-fought battle, received a wake-up call: They are in need of radical reform and structural change. Though Romney’s campaign was quite successful, as the race was as close as it was predicted to be, it relied too much on the economy as the single most important issue to voters. He failed to take a forward-enough thinking stance on education, immigration, women’s rights and gay rights, effectively alienating voting blocs that made a huge difference for the Democrats. The Republican Party must be able to rebound and adapt to the new changing America, learning to lean much more toward tolerance and middle ground than conservatism. It must also reconcile its past differences and learn to work with the Democratic Party, which must do the same.
And the fact that the 2012 election played out so similarly to the one four years ago — a Democratic president elected with a divided Congress — is not just by coincidence. America is being given a second chance to truly move forward and work through partisanship to become the America this election indicates it is on track to become.
With a changing America comes changing approaches to how citizens and politicians alike work together. Romney touched on this in his concession speech Tuesday night.
“The nation, as you know, is at a critical point,” he said. “At a time like this, we can’t risk partisan bickering and political posturing. Our leaders have to reach across the aisle to do the people’s work. And we citizens also have to rise to the occasion.”
Obama spoke to the theme of rising above division as well.
“I believe we can seize this future together because we are not as divided as our politics suggests,” he said. We’re not as cynical as the pundits believe. We are greater than the sum of our individual ambitions, and we remain more than a collection of red states and blue states.”
One of the most crucial things to remember is that reaching across the aisle is not just the government’s responsibility. It’s the government and the American people, together, united that accomplished all that we did. As the election results illustrate, from the women’s sweep of the Senate to the first-time legalization of gay marriage, the nation has a new dream that all Americans must all unite under and pursue.
In the election-closing words of Obama, “It doesn’t matter whether you’re black or white or Hispanic or Asian or Native American or young or old or rich or poor, able, disabled, gay or straight, you can make it here in America if you’re willing to try.” This election, and the nation of today, breathes life into the American dream. In a time of such divided politics, it is time to recognize that the American dream is being reinvented, and the only way to move forward is to do so together.

Jax4USC- were you one of the case studies in your Abnormal Psychology course?
Would you say the same if the GOP had won this election? My guess is no, seeing as how you urge them to change so much. Why shouldn’t this election have been about the economy? People have been whining about it for the past four years, and all of a sudden it isn’t the center of attention? Absolutely ridiculous and even hypocritical. 
I’m sick of these “precedents”; let’s just get the best person to do the job, regardless of race. I don’t see why the “first xxx to be elected” is such a big deal. I’m in a minority myself, and I couldn’t care less.
Gabriel:
What’s wrong with the placement of “disabled” and “gay?’  Back when I was a student at USC, when it was an institution of learning, rather than an instrument of introdoction, the conundrum you present was no problem.  A simple course of Abnormal Psychology 101 would solve your distress.
Fight On!
JLH
I don’t like that you placed the word “disabled” next to “gay” in the article.  It might be a coincidence but I think more sensitivity is called for at the DT.
That word placement of “disabled” and “gay” was directly from the transcript of Obama’s acceptance speech. transcript: http://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/decision2012/president-obamas-acceptance-speech-full-transcript/2012/11/07/ae133e44-28a5-11e2-96b6-8e6a7524553f_story.html 
It wasn’t DT’s choice of words.
Great writing. GOP has some soul-searching to do, while Democrats also need to focus on the fundamentals. Let’s go, America!

Elena Kadvany | Point: Partisanship cannot continue as is
My initial reaction to the news that President Barack Obama was re-elected was relief, not excitement.
I was relieved that the leader I believe in gets another four years to prove himself to those who don’t believe in him the way I do, and to continue the critical efforts he has made to improve this country.
On the Rachel Maddow Show this week, she suggested that the 2012 campaign was so dominated by slander, polarization and false accusations that these very significant efforts have been rendered almost invisible. He repealed don’t ask, don’t tell. He ended the War in Iraq and brought American troops home from Afghanistan, as promised. He oversaw the assassination of Osama bin Laden. He reinvigorated the American auto industry. He signed the nation’s largest job stimulus bill in history into law. He elected two women to the Supreme Court, one of them the first Hispanic Supreme Court justice in the history of the United States. He openly endorsed gay marriage. Just this week, he officially signed his student loan relief program into law.
But for some reason, all of those incredibly varied, critically important accomplishments got lost in the flood of negative ad campaigns, billions of dollars, binders full of women, and deepening divides between parties and people.
The thing is, just because the election is over does not guarantee that all of that is coming to an end. And what would be the most dangerous for Americans and this country’s future is if the partisanship — that increased to epic proportions during Obama’s first term and this election season — would continue as is, and further hinder the progress that the country desperately needs to make.
And though Obama is the best man for the job, even he cannot guarantee a fix for arguably the greatest problem we face in the next four years.
The real challenge now, for Obama, Democrats, Republicans, politicians and Americans alike is figuring out how to work together. It is time to move past the craziness of the past couple of months and for everyone on both sides, whether they supported Obama, Romney or someone else, to commit to the next generation of decision-making and nation building.

Burke Gibson | Counterpoint: In defense of bipartisan politics
The 2012 presidential election has been rightfully criticized for allowing the divide between the Republican and Democratic parties to interfere with the integrity of the election itself. It’s led to too many personal attacks and not enough focus on real issues, and has caused gridlock in the House of Representatives and the Senate — in an Election Day blog post, Google co-founder Sergey Brin called the government a “bonfire of partisanship” and requested that whichever candidate wins run the country as an independent.
It’s easy to criticize the inefficiencies in our current system, but do we really have another option? The concept of “Republican vs. Democrat” goes back to America’s origins, when Federalists and Republicans were competing for similar elected positions. Two-party politics is part of American culture and has proven relatively effective over the last couple hundred years; attempting to change such an ingrained part of society would be too monumental a task for us to see any real change in the near future.
And even if it was possible to change to a multi-party system, there’s no guarantee it would work. Having multiple prominent parties could leave more people unsatisfied with the results of an election, and groups would have the ability to focus on specific issues rather than a complete platform. There’s a reason the number of political parties tends to be limited even in other countries: The only way to run a country effectively is to have a broad enough platform to cover most important issues, which few parties have the resources to manage.
Rather than criticize the bipartisan system itself, we should be looking for ways to make it more efficient and streamlined. Essentially, our politicians need to start behaving as servants of the state first and servants of their parties second. We’ve seen the opposite recently — Republicans have shot down bills in the house, including one that would have provided aid to veterans over five years, solely to prevent President Barack Obama’s re-election. And the Democrats haven’t been on their best behavior, either: There has been no shortage of below-the-belt campaign advertisements, and Obama has a lot of work before he even comes close to fulfilling some of the promises he made before his first term.
Obama has the potential to be an excellent leader over the next four years, as long as he recognizes gridlock and animosity between parties as the main problem with the bipartisan system. It isn’t fundamentally flawed — it just needs fixing.
Let’s not pretend the slander didn’t swing both ways, or that Barrack didn’t avoid the issues. He takes credit for killing Osama, but he’s not responsible in any way for  Benghazi? Really? (Throw Hillary under the bus for that one but take credit for Bid Laden)? Wow. You are right Elena, I hope that after 4 years he starts to prove himself  – and soon. And that the debt doesn’t increase another 5 trillion during this next term. I’m not religious but I will start praying for him and this country. 
I wasn’t excited either,  and certainly not relieved.  Mitt Romney was not a good choice by the Republican party.  He likely would have been a good president, as good as Obama anyway, and at least not left us with another 5 trillion in debt in 2016. We are still in college and our first unborn children (each) owe $50,000 as I write this. We may be okay, maybe, but what about their kids? 
To the Dems credit, the Republican party needs to realize that we want government in our lives as a safety net, but we don’t need them to tell us what to do with our bodies, what to smoke or not smoke, or whom to marry. Why don’t they get that? 
I agree, millionaires and billionaires can pay more, but that isn’t going to be enough. Until spending (and rampant waste) is under control, it doesn’t matter. What has Obama said about out of control spending? Can you write a column on that?  I would LOVE to read it. Please – address the dept and spending in a column.
Back to the GOP…Paul Ryan? The Republican party hasn’t learned anything in four years after the McCain/Palin debacle. Rick Santorum? What’s amazing is that Republican leaders don’t get that they should run from him like the plague. Even Mitt knew that – hence Palin’s and Santorum’s absence during this run.
Chris Christie, standing next to BO, after hurricane Sandy – THAT is a ticket for this nation. Or how about Christie/Clinton 2016? Like marriage equality, hopefully this will be the future. The Rick Santorums will have no more place in history than bigots and the KKK.  Hillary is smart, experienced, and saavy, and her ego is in check. She’s been schlepping in Pakistan, Isreal, Afghanistan, a role model for ANYONE. (While Barrack has been campaigning on AF1 and hanging out with David Letterman and the rest of the talk show circuit). Oh and Vegas during the attack on the embassy?  Actually I’m just making a point. Yes he’s done SOMETHING for health care. But had George W been in VEGAS AFTER THE BENGHAZI ATTACK …..6 trillion added to the deficit? 5 million jobs created – but 5.2 million lost?
Democrat or Republican, don’t forget – both sides have valid platforms and that is what we all want, isn’t it? Journalists try harder than most to report both sides, but a majority are unprofessional and can’t hide their bias and loose credibility.
I think what is most guilty in poisoning the well of political discourse is a media that fails to disseminate facts, choosing instead to taking an active role promoting spin in service of a particular agenda. Stating both sides do it merely masks the rot.
As observed by Daniel Patrick Moynihan – “You are entitled to your own opinion, but you are not entitled to your own facts.”
A campaign insisting that, “We’re not going to let our campaign be dictated by fact checkers” shows a new level of contempt for the electorate, further enabled by a complicit media.

Beginning next week, USC residence halls will require students to present their student ID and scan their fingerprint in order to gain entry to their buildings, according to an email from USC Housing.
The email said the move was made to better ensure safety in USC Housing facilities.
“As part of USC Housing’s continuing effort to make your residence safer we will be installing fingerprint scanners at every building entry point,” the email said. “Once the units are installed each resident will be required to show a valid ID card and to authenticate his/her identity via fingerprint biometrics.”
Guests will still be allowed into the residences but will be required to leave a valid ID in exchange for a guest pass.
The Dept. of Public Safety had no role in this decision.
“I wasn’t even actually a party for the discussion,” DPS Capt. David Carlisle said.  “It was a housing decision to implement the fingerprint reader.”
Michael Jackson, vice president for Student Affairs, said the changes are not related to an on-campus shooting that wounded four last Wednesday.
“This is something we have been working on since probably the summer time,” Jackson said.
Jackson said the changes will prevent fewer unwanted guests from visiting the residence halls, especially during large on-campus events, such as tailgates.
“Now there is the technology available to allow us to ensure that the people who live there and who are invited by the people who live there get access to the residences,” Jackson said.
Some students have reacted negatively to the change.
Deena Khattab, a freshman majoring in print and digital journalism and living in Birnkrant Residential College, said she believes the change will be ineffective.
“If you’re motivated to gain access to any of these buildings on campus, you’ll find a way to do it, whether or not there is fingerprinting,” Khattab said.
Other students, however, said they believe the fingerprinting will serve its purpose and improve security.
“It’s better for the students’ safety, and it’s better to be safe then sorry,” said Anna Lea Damir, a freshman majoring in chemical engineering.
Students are required to scan their fingerprint at their local Customer Service Center by 6 p.m. on Friday to register for the system. The services are available at Arts & Humanities for those living in Parkside; Fluor Tower for those in Fluor Tower and Webb Tower; New/North College for those in the North Area; and Pardee Tower for those in the South Area.
Daniel Rothberg contributed to this report.

– Benjamin Franklin
This is a good step towards better safety for students. I know some people will not like it or argue that if one really wanted break I’m they’ll always find a way. While the latter point true, I think taking steps to improving safety isn’t to stop all crimes but to reduce the likelihood. Everybody complains bout these measures until something goes wrong, then all criticisms will be pointed at the school for ” not doing enough”
How will I get hookers up into my dorm room?  This sounds complicated!

Just one step closer to turning USC into a police state. These steps are reactionary and are not going to solve anything.
Deena is right on this. This is a bit ridiculous though.

Undergraduate Student Government passed legislation that will help bolster the student body voice on campus at its regular Tuesday meeting. While one resolution focused on encouraging the university’s administration to purchase conflict-free minerals, the government also voted to update its code for their electoral system for its upcoming elections.
Student government’s revisions to the 2012-13 election codes also seek to better express the student body voice. The revisions regulate where candidates can campaign and require candidates to be more transparent by presenting their campaign finance plan to the student body financial transparency for the student body.
USC’s chapter of the Student Alliance for Nationalism and Democracy, a national student-led anti-genocide coalition, sponsored the conflict-free minerals resolution. In the Democratic Republic of the Congo, there is currently a deadly scramble by the government to secure control of the mines for minerals used to create electronics. The conflict between different groups seeking control of the mines has culminated in the largest genocide since World War II.
The university is a major consumer and investor of technology that originated from the Congo’s minerals, according to STAND president Francesca Bessey, a sophomore majoring in international relations and narrative studies.
Since the fall semester of 2011, STAND has worked on a resolution that would have USC withhold its patronage from companies that contribute to the genocide. Last spring a petition supporting the development of a conflict-free policy at USC garnered 1,247 student signatures.
The resolution calls for the university’s administration to consider a company’s conflict mineral status when purchasing electronics. By not purchasing from companies that use conflict minerals, this resolution hopes that companies will be prompted to change their own policies. This resolution falls in line with the university’s mission of being “a global institution in a global center.”
“Any action that helps preserve human life is in the best interest of the university and by taking a step to prevent genocide, USC is on the right track,” said Jonathan Stoller-Schoff, a freshman majoring in philosophy, politics and law.
Lara McDonough, a sophomore majoring in political science and East Asian languages and cultures, hopes that this resolution will garner more student support for the Congo on campus.
“I hope students become more aware of the conflict, and begin making personal decisions to use conflict free minerals,” McDonough said.
Other cities and colleges across the nation, such as Stanford University and the University of Pennsylvania, have also adopted conflict-free policies.
Speaker Pro Tempore and Greek Senator Matthew Arkfeld, a senior majoring in East Asian area studies, sponsored the resolution along with Residential Senator Jasmine McAllister, a senior majoring in economics and mathematics and neuroscience. Arkfeld believes the student body will benefit from this resolution.
“STAND has done an extraordinary job at gauging student interest,” Arkfeld said. “I believe this resolution adequately represents the voice of the students because it is coming directly from students itself.”

After an on-campus shooting wounded four last Wednesday, President C. L. Max Nikias announced plans to implement new security policies, such as banning outside event promoters and requiring identification to access the University Park Campus from 9 p.m. to 6 a.m. seven days a week. Entry to campus will be restricted to students, faculty, staff and their guests after 9 p.m.
The shooting occurred after Brandon Spencer, a 20-year-old from Inglewood, allegedly opened fire during a verbal dispute with Geno Hall, a former football player at Crenshaw High School. The incident occurred outside a Halloween party promoted by LA Hype in association with the Black Student Assembly. Spencer, who pleaded not guilty to four counts of attempted murder on Monday, wounded Hall and three unintended victims.
The university aims to implement all measures, which Nikias said are designed to prevent future incidents, by Jan. 14, 2013 — the start of the spring semester.
Michael Jackson, vice president for student affairs, told the Daily Trojan Nikias’ announcement underscores his commitment to ensuring safety.
“I want [students] to know their president is concerned about how the campus operates and that he wants it to be safe — that’s the big word,” Jackson said. “And that we are willing to take very affirmative steps toward doing that.”
Three measures concerning social events went into effect immediately. Organizers for events at USC facilities, or on The Row, are no longer permitted to use outside promoters. In addition, Dept. of Public Safety officers are required to check the IDs of all guests at on-campus events.
Additionally, the university also plans to evaluate its approval process for student event applications.
As part of the changes, USC will increase the number of DPS officers and yellow jacket ambassadors on the perimeter of campus, Nikias said. In addition, USC plans to install more security cameras on the perimeter of campus and at entrances to the university. Security will also be stationed in front of residence halls to check IDs 24 hours a day, according to Nikias.
University officials are still developing plans to restrict after-hours access to campus, especially at larger entrances, such as the intersection at Trousdale Parkway and Exposition Boulevard.
Jackson said he hopes students are receptive to the changes and provide the university with feedback during their implementation. Jackson also said the changes are not meant to interrupt day-to-day life on campus.
“We do not, in any way, want to impede the regular activities of students, faculty and staff,” he said.
Though increased security is expensive, Jackson said improved security outweighs the extra costs.
“The university is going to find it within its resources for these extra expenses,” Jackson said. “They are not inexpensive, but they are important expenditures if they, in fact, enhance safety.”
The decision to adopt the new polices involved senior administration, DPS and General Counsel, Jackson said. On Monday, Student Affairs briefed leaders of student groups, including Undergraduate Student Government and the Inter-Fraternity Council.
This was crazy but you have to admit that the surrounding area to usc is DEFINITELY ghetto! Some people have ties with these gangs which lead to these people getting invited and specially in the black community. I’m not being racist its just a fact.
Why is it so hard to understand for people that USC must do all it can to keep the gangs of its campus? I’m extremely happy with the new measures. Afterall, many nice living complexes, even in great areas are closed to the public and have guards at their entrances. Noone complains about that. We all know that SC is in the ghetto. It is bad enough that our students have to be afraid to walk the streets outside of campus they should at least be able to feel safe and secure on campus. Orwellian you know well that the shooting that happened on campus was a gang shooting. Had the victim not been able to enter campus [he even tweeted to all the homies when he entered SC campus “here comes the neighborhood” [referring to the Rollin 40s neighborhood crips of which he is a member].”This in turn brought his enemies to campus. USc must do all it possibly can to keep these people of campus because LAPD does not do anything to keep these people of the streets of South Central.
“We all know that SC is in the ghetto.”
Go play in traffic, or enroll in the shiny temple of West Los Angeles.  The community and the campus are unexchangeable, moron.  What happened was a random act of fckery that happens when these two world collide.  I’m all for the new measure, but the baseless vitrol you speak is further evidence of the university’s inability to curtail the growing tide of ignorance.
aluminati is your messages directed to me? I certainly hope not as you are being incredibly rude and disrespectful to me and there is no reason for you to behave in such a manner. My message is all facts. This was a gang shooting! The main victim is a gang member [I have proof of that] and evidentally the shooter is a gang meber as well and this case is being prosecuted by one of the toughest gang prosecutors in LA.
Are you honestly arguing that USC is not in the ghetto? Where are you from, Somalia?
Welcome to the police state.  Posting officers at the University’s entrances will be a huge waste of manpower.  How about more patrols, instead?
Police state?  College kids can be so over dramatic lol!

Students, faculty and staff flocked to the polls on Tuesday to weigh in on a slew of local and state issues, ranging from taxes for education funding to the use of condoms in adult films.
Gov. Jerry Brown’s initiative to raise the state sales tax and increase taxes on individuals earning over $250,000 was leading by about four points with 53 percent of precincts reporting at press time at midnight. According to several polls, Proposition 30 had been losing support among likely voters in recent weeks. If the measure fails, trigger cuts could go into effect, slashing funding for California schools.
“I’m feeling pretty confident that this vote will turn out to be in the positive column,’’ Brown told NBC News.
Brown’s plan has been competing with Proposition 38, billionaire Molly Munger’s tax increase to fund K-12 schools. Prop. 38 failed, according to the Los Angeles Times, with the California Secretary of State website showing support at 26.8 percent.
Proposition 35, an initiative to increase the punishment for human traffickers, was successful, according to the Associated Press. Support for the initiative was at 82 percent. In addition, Proposition 36, a push to revise California’s three strikes law, was leading 68.5 percent to 31.5 percent.
Two heavily watched initiatives, Proposition 34 and Proposition 37, appear to be losing, early results show. Prop. 34, a ban on the death penalty, had about 45.9 percent support. Prop. 37, a push to require labeling of genetically modified food, was also down with 45.0 percent support.
In L.A. County, voters considered three measures. Voters appear to have passed Measure J, an extension of a 2008 initiative to add a half-cent sales tax that funds transportation projects. The measure had received 64.8 percent support with 38 percent of precincts reporting.
Measure B, which requires that condoms be used when filming pornography, passed with early results showing 59.9 percent support.
Early results also showed Measure A, an initiative to make the county assessor an appointed position, failing with support from only 22.8 percent of voters in reported precincts.
Voters also cast their ballots in a race to elect a new district attorney for the county. Deputy District Attorney Jackie Lacey is leading in a race against prosecutor Alan Jackson, according to early results. Lacey was leading by about by about nine percentage points with support from about 54.9 percent of voters from reported precincts.
Turnout in Los Angeles County dipped about 15 percentage points from 2008, according to initial estimates from the county clerk’s office. Monica Flores, a spokesperson at the county clerk’s office, said estimates at 8 p.m. showed voter turnout at about 66 percent — down from 82 percent in 2008.
Throughout the day Tueday, organizers from student organizations worked to get out the vote. Maddy Lansky, president of the College Republicans, encouraged members to vote in state races, especially because California was likely to award its electoral votes to President Barack Obama.
“For the congressional candidates, for the state assembly candidates and for the California propositions, it is critical that they get out and cast their vote,” Lansky said. “So that’s what we’re hoping to accomplish and we’re hoping to see a big victory in the down-ballot candidates here in California.”
 
Yasmeen Serhan contributed to this report. All data was reported as of press time at midnight. Fifty-three percent of precincts had reported in the state and 38 percent had reported in the county.

Students from both sides of the aisle came together Tuesday in a final match-up to take part in a phone banking competition in the Annenberg East Lobby for the final day of the election.
Persistence · Student volunteers call California and Nevada voters Tuesday to convince individuals to turn out to vote in the election. – Joseph Chen | Daily Trojan
The competition, sponsored by USC College Democrats, USC College Republicans and the Jesse M. Unruh Institute of Politics, aimed at motivating and encouraging voters to turn out on Election Day through phone calls.
For USC College Democrats President Aaron Taxy, the goal of the competition was to encourage eligible and capable voters to cast their ballots.
“In the few precious days leading up to the election, now we [transitioned] to make sure that everyone who is committed to vote for the president has the opportunity to submit their ballot and make their vote count,” Taxy said. “We [did] this by calling them to remind them about election day, [letting] them know where their polling place is and making sure that they have a ride to the polling place if they are unable to drive themselves.”
USC College Republicans president Maddy Lansky emphasized the impact that voters not only had on the presidential election, but  also on localized ballot measures.
“What we’re hoping to accomplish today is just to call as many voters as we can in California and also possibly Nevada to remind them to get to the polls and vote,” Lansky said.
Throughout the election cycle, Democrat and Republican students alike mobilized in an attempt to solidify support among young voters for their respective candidates. According to USC College Republicans membership director Lisa Ebiner Gavit, the focus shifted from swing-states to more local voters in the final hours of the election.
“We [did] a lot of phone banking, both off campus and at the Republican victory office in Thousand Oaks to precinct walk [door-to-door campaigning] and phone bank for both Romney and for local candidates,” Gavit said. “We’ve been trying to impact the swing states, but now we’re just calling locally to get out the vote and make sure that people don’t forget to turn in their absentee ballots or show up to the polls.”
The USC College Democrats set a goal of making 5,000 calls this election, which USC Trojans for Obama President Kaya Masler said the groups met Tuesday afternoon.
“The reason that we want to make calls is because a call means more than any kind of online advertisement or any kind of ad on TV that people can see — it’s personal,” Masler said. “We get to talk to voters about why we think this election is important to us and we get to have an honest conversation.”
To Masler, the grassroots efforts made by Americans across the country has had a profound effect on the outcome of the election.
“They talk about this election being polarizing,” Masler said. “But nothing has ever brought people together this way.”
About  66  percent of registered voters turned out to polling places in Los Angeles County,   according to Monica Flores, a  spokesperson from the county clerk’s office. Masler’s observation about voters feeling excited by the election proved somewhat true.
“I’ve seen a lot of my peers vote, especially when I walked into here. There was a big rush of people coming,” said Sean Lee, a senior majoring in biology. “Like me, a lot of them here are first time voters so they feel the empowerment to vote after all these years of watching and waiting.”
Though the county clerk’s office said turnout decreased from 2008, some voters said the closeness of the election might have motivated the people to vote.
“It’s a close election,” Dusty Black, a USC alumnus who graduated in 2012 and voted in South Los Angeles, said, “There are a lot of measures that are highly disputed and people want to get their opinions across.”
Susy Ruiz, a senior majoring in cultural anthropology, said she knew some of her peers felt motivated to vote because of polls projecting the election to be close.
“Even in the early morning, [people] came [to the polls] just to make sure their vote will be counted since they heard it would be chaotic,” Ruiz said.

It takes a rare event to attract more than 500 students to the courtyard outside the Ronald Tutor Campus Center on a Tuesday evening. The 2012 presidential election did just that.
Engagement · Students await Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney’s concession speech in the Ronald Tutor Campus Center courtyard on Tuesday night at a viewing party that began at 5 p.m. – Chris Roman | Daily Trojan
Students from across the political spectrum, many of whom voted for the first time this November, gathered around a giant screen to watch the results come in live on CNN.
“We did this four years ago in the Annenberg lobby, but because the turnout for our debate watches was so much larger this year, we realized we had to move our election night program outside,” said Dan Schnur, director of the Jesse M. Unruh Institute of Politics, a co-sponsor of the event. “I estimate that we’ve seen roughly 500 people tonight, which is about twice what we drew for election night four years ago.”
Giuseppe Robalino, a freshman majoring in business administration, praised students for coming together for this important event, regardless of their political views.
“It’s great in the sense to see all the youth out here together — it shows us that our democratic processes are strong, they’re working,” said Robalino, a member of the USC College Republicans. “It feels great above all to be an American here — to be an American in this day and age with so much turn out and so many people giving a damn about what’s going on in this country and in the world.”
Cheers erupted when CNN announced at 8:20 p.m. that President Barack Obama had been re-elected for a second term, especially from students in Trojans for Obama, who have spent months campaigning.
For USC College Democrats member Victoria Hallebo, a junior majoring in film critical studies, Obama’s victory was a huge win.
“I’m overjoyed. I’m really really excited,” said Hallebo. “I’ve been working on this campaign for basically two years and tonight is finally the night that it has paid off.”
Matt Tsai, a junior majoring in accounting, said he chose to vote for Romney after a lot of deliberation.
“I honestly liked both candidates,” Tsai said. “I feel like the biggest issue in this election was the economy and I felt like Romney is better equipped to handle the economy, so he won my vote by a slim margin.”
Looking forward, students from both political parties are hopeful about the next four years.
“Usually in a president’s first term, they don’t do much,” said Hanh Tranton, a sophomore majoring in biological sciences. “But in their second term, they tend to actually deliver on the promises that they made when they first campaigned. So I’m hopeful that [Obama] will deliver on more actions this time around.”
Aside from watching the live results, students took advantage of free food, photo opportunities with cardboard cutouts of the candidates and the chance to have their portraits done by a caricaturist.
“It’s awesome that we have a campus that we can sit around and come together and watch,” said Alicia Dewell, a sophomore majoring in philosophy. “It was a great bonding experience.”

Barack Obama finished off a hard-fought race with a victory, grabbing his reelection as the 44th President of the United States on Tuesday night.
As most major networks began calling the election around 8:20 p.m., hundreds of students anxiously following a live broadcast in the Ronald Tutor Campus Center courtyard erupted in screams and cheers.

Though the popular vote appeared close, Obama took enough key states to make it nearly impossible for Republican challenger Mitt Romney to win the 270 electoral votes needed to be elected president.
As of press time, Obama took 303 electoral college votes, as Romney lagged behind at 206.
Obama won the battleground states of New Hampshire and Pennsylvania, and was widely projected to win Wisconsin, making it impossible for Romney to catch up.
Exit polls and most major networks also predicted that Obama would carry Ohio, taking 18 more key electoral college votes that Romney would have needed to win.
The president also took the swing states of Colorado, New Mexico, Nevada and Virginia, along with historically blue states including California, New York and Illinois.
Obama’s campaign tweeted from his official Twitter account soon after the race was called.
“We’re all in this together. That’s how we campaigned, and that’s who we are. Thank you,” he wrote.
In his acceptance speech, Obama thanked not only his campaign team, but also the electorate as a whole.
“I want to thank every American who participated in this election. Whether you voted for the very first time, or waiting in line for a very long time — by the way, we have to fix that,” he said. “Whether you pounded the pavement or picked up the phone. Whether you held an Obama sign or a Romney sign, you made your voice heard and you made a difference.”
Obama also emphasized that though he won this battle, he still expects to face challenges and backlash in his second term.
In his second term, the president faces a divided Congress, with a majority of Democrats controlling the Senate and the Republicans controlling the House of Representatives.
“When we go through tough times, when we make big decisions as a country, it necessarily stirs up passions and stirs up controversy,” he said. “It won’t change after tonight.”
The president also addressed the occasionally nasty campaign, and emphasized his respect for Romney.
“We may have battled fiercely, but it’s only because we love this country deeply and we care so strongly about its future,” Obama said. “In the weeks ahead, I also look forward to sitting down with Gov. Romney to talk about how we can work together to move this country forward.”
Romney smiled and joked in his concession speech, remarking that his wife Ann “would have made a wonderful First Lady.” Despite his loss, Romney sent his best wishes to Obama and his family.
“This is a time of great challenges for America,” Romney said, “and I pray that the president will be successful in guiding our nation.”
He also expressed his hope for the nation’s recovery and that Obama would the president to help the nation recover.
“I believe in America, I believe in the people of America, and I ran for office because I am concerned about America,” Romney said. “This election is over, but the principles endure.”
The President closed the night with his hope that the nation could bypass partisanship.
“We remain more than a collection of red states and blue states,” Obama said. “We are and forever will be the United States of America.”
