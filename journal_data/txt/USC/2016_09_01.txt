Professor Matthew Kahn, in conjunction with the USC Annenberg US-China Institute, presented his book, Blue Skies Over Beijing: Economic Growth and the Environment in China, and discussed the implications of pollution on China’s society Thursday afternoon.
Kahn, a professor in the economics department of the USC Dornsife College of Letters, Arts and Sciences, focuses on researching environmental and urban economics. He co-wrote the book with Siqi Zheng, the director of the Hang Lung Center for Real Estate at Tsinghua University in China.
In the book, Zheng shares her experiences of growing up and living in China. She determined her lifestyle based on the pollution levels in the air each day, Kahn said.
Kahn used his statistical background when writing the book to offer hope that China is incentivizing reducing pollution and suggested that the country will eventually implement more sustainability initiatives.
“I’m always an optimist,” Kahn said. “My mother always told me not to engage in wishful thinking, but I’m always looking for good news.”
Kahn began the presentation by showing decreasing concentrations of particulate matter (PM10) in Chinese cities from 2002 to 2012. PM10 measures pollution and is linked with increased morbidity, Kahn said. 
“Beijing’s pollution declined when the population and per-capita income was growing,” Kahn said.
Kahn specifically mentioned the low levels of PM10 during the 2008 Olympics.
“Air pollution is getting better,” Kahn said. “When the Olympics took place [in Beijing], there was a huge drop in PM10.”
Kahn then walked the audience through the 10 chapters of his book. In it, he discusses the need for sustainability certifications, green real estate development and the investment in human capital.
Zheng and Kahn suggest that China should adopt measures to verify more sustainable buildings to drive green real estate development. Kahn credits the internet, the Chinese getting richer and the global low-carbon push in driving environmental justice.
 “The Chinese have lost their information monopoly,” Kahn said. “This is how you bring about accountability.”
He focused on the quality of Chinese urban living as the nation grows richer.
“China has shown a willingness to adopt new ideas,” he said. “As people and nations grow richer, they’re willing to be pay more to be exposed to less risk.”
He cites the global movement to reduce carbon emissions and the Chinese realization of it as the pressure needed to promote and pass green initiatives.
“In recent years, the central government is making a green push,” Kahn said. “The Chinese government has not had the firmest grasp on power. One way to continue to have power is to be loved by your people. If people want blue skies, then out of self-interest, the Chinese Communist Party actually has interest to supply them. Especially with technological change, it becomes cheaper.”
Clayton Dube, director of the USC U.S.-China Institute, believes it is essential for the USC community to learn more about the relationship between the United States and China. 
“The purpose of these programs is to inform public discussion,” Dube said. “We think that the most important relationship in the world is the U.S.-China relationship.”
Maggie Chen, a junior majoring in social science with an emphasis in economics, attended Kahn’s talk to learn more about the issue. While working as an intern in Beijing the past year, she frequently noticed high pollution levels.
“They do have some blue skies, but sometimes it’s really bad, and you can’t see anything,” Chen said. “I thought it was interesting to see this from a more academic perspective.”
Kahn also writes a blog about urban economics and the environment called Green Economics.
Kahn does not blame China for increased pollution. Rather, he described it as a side effect the people have to find a way to counter.
“Nobody intends to produce pollution,” Kahn said. “Pollution is a by-product of how we live today, economic activity. If we change the game — if we have pollution taxes, if we encourage green research and development — we have ways to have cleaner conditions with the same level of economic growth.”

Lena Altaffer | Daily TrojanExamining education · Sara Atwood, a professor of English literature at Portland State University, visited USC on Thursday to speak at the 17th annual Ruskin Art Lecture in Doheny Memorial Library.
Portland State University Professor Sara Atwood spoke on the troubling portrayal of education in the United States’ contemporary market society Thursday at Doheny Memorial Library. The event was hosted by the Ruskin Art Club, a Los Angeles-based organization aimed at promoting the teachings of 19th-century art critic John Ruskin.
Atwood’s main argument involved the idea that a more functional view of education — a means to an end rather than an intrinsically valuable pursuit — resulted from the value placed on financial success and negatively impacted learning in today’s students. Atwood pointed out that a lack of focus on fine arts and crafts and a movement toward a more job-oriented education style were hallmarks of the new educational climate.
“We emphasize [career preparation] so much … that we don’t think about what education really means in and of itself,” Atwood said.
Atwood said that few students get to do what they love and explore the areas in which they are talented because the educational system is incredibly job-oriented and areas of concentration like the arts are seen as secondary, especially at the university level.
Atwood argued that the only way to remedy or improve the situation is to have students communicate their unrest with the current state of the system. However, she pointed out that colleges like USC are stepping in the right direction in terms of allowing a broader spectrum of education for its students. 
“There seems to be a real interest and drawing to the arts at USC,” Atwood said.
Atwood noted that President C. L. Max Nikias sends out emails to the students and faculty with discussions about the fine arts. 
Katherine Kelly, a sophomore majoring in English, found Atwood’s observations relevant to her educational experiences at the University. 
“There is definitely a focus right now on the end goal of getting a job, but USC does well at providing a broader education for its students and encouraging everyone to participate in the arts,” Kelly said.
Gabriel Meyer, the executive director of the Ruskin Art Club, coordinated Thursday’s event, the 17th annual Ruskin Lecture held at the University. 
“[The Ruskin Lecture] is a major event that begins the season of the Ruskin Art Club, Los Angeles’s oldest cultural art club that dates back to 1888,” Meyer said.
The Ruskin Art Club was started by a group of women in Los Angeles who wanted to educate themselves in the arts. The club was named after John Ruskin, who was a social activist for women’s rights and education in 19th century England.
Atwood, who published the book Ruskin’s Educational Ideals in 2011, believes that Ruskin’s thoughts on education and the problems occurring within the educational system are as relevant now as during the Industrial Revolution. 
As a result, her lecture touched upon the modern challenges in education and how Ruskin’s ideas could be of help. 
“The purpose of education is a very hot topic right now, [including] the shape of education [and] the goals of education,” Meyer said. “Ruskin has a great deal to say about education, and [Atwood] has written an insightful book about it.” 
Since 2015, USC has hosted the Ruskin Art Club’s archives within the Special Collections Library. The club put many of the works on display during the event, which was the second time that USC Libraries has hosted the Ruskin Lecture.

The Steven A. Cohen Military Family Clinic at USC opened its doors Wednesday to post-9/11 veterans and their families seeking treatment for post-traumatic stress disorder and other conditions. 
The clinic arose from a $15.7 million donation by Steven A. Cohen, CEO of Point72 Asset Management, through his foundation, the Cohen Veterans Network. This family clinic, located on Flower Street, is a collaboration between Cohen’s foundation, the USC School of Social Work, and the Keck School of Medicine of USC.
Out of the 2.6 million post-9/11 veterans, 40 percent do not access the healthcare available to them, and 20 percent experience post-traumatic stress, according to Veterans and PTSD. It’s the hope of the clinic, Arnett said, to reverse that trend by using innovative technology, social support and community interaction to help both veterans and their families continue on with their lives. 
One of the goals of the clinic, according to director Kathryn Arnett, is to go above and beyond therapy sessions and provide veterans with the tools they need to transition into civilian life. 
“The kind of services veterans seek are not just a 15-minute behavioral health session,” Arnett said. “They’re looking for things like housing and social support and resources and how to access those resources.” 
The Cohen Military Clinic integrates family care with veteran care because children, partners and close friends are also negatively impacted by a service member’s post-traumatic stress. 
“What makes us different is that we provide care for families of service members,” Arnett said. 
For many veterans, getting to a clinic isn’t feasible because of distance or disability, so the Cohen Military Clinic plans to create satellite clinics in order to provide veterans with the care they need without having to leave their homes. One of Arnett’s goals for the future of the clinic is to bring holistic care to veterans throughout California, not just those around the USC location.
“The most important goal is that we meet veterans where they are,” Arnett said. “Our outreach team is already out in the community working with veterans side by side, letting them know what our services are and how we can help.”
Arnett said that a highlight of the Cohen Military Clinic is its care for veterans who are not covered by the U.S. Veterans Association, including those who served in the National Guard or Reserves. 
“We work with veterans that have an other than honorable discharge,” Arnett said. “We also have a very robust tele-mental health program.”
In addition to hosting the Cohen Military Clinic, the School of Social Work has trained 1,300 students in military social work, and the USC Center for Innovation and Research on Veterans and Military Families is providing the community with evidence-based care. 
The $15.7 million donation by the Cohen Foundation is part of a larger donation of $275 million to create the Cohen Veterans Network, launched in April 2016, that will provide care to veterans across the country at 25 clinics. 
USC is the third clinic to open. There are four other clinics open in Texas and Pennsylvania.

In 2007, an unproven coach by the name of Jim Harbaugh took over the Stanford football program — one that had a 1-11 record the year before — and immediately went after the mighty Pete Carroll-led Trojans by openly speculating that Carroll would soon leave USC.
“We bow to no man,” Harbaugh said after Carroll rebuked him. “We bow to no program at Stanford University.”
Five weeks into the season, Harbaugh took his 1-3 Cardinal into the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum to face the No. 2 team in the country as 41-point underdogs and pulled off one of the biggest upsets in college football history, winning 24-23. 
Two years later, Harbaugh did it again, as No. 25 Stanford dropped a record 55 points on No. 11 USC on the road, handing the Trojans a historic 34-point defeat. He infamously went for a 2-point conversion while up by 27 points late in the fourth quarter, then traded “What’s your deal” jabs with Carroll in a half-hearted post-game handshake. 
Full disclosure: I grew up less than 20 miles from Stanford and I loved watching Harbaugh coach at The Farm and later up the road with the 49ers. He knew exactly how to push the envelope, take risks, be bold and brash and then back it up by winning (I believe he’s the best coach in all of football today, period) — in other words, he perfected the underdog role.
Flash forward to 2016, and USC enters the season with a few question marks, an inexperienced coach and as a double-digit underdog to No. 1-ranked Alabama.
Sound familiar? Not exactly.
USC is ranked No. 20 in the nation. It is far from an unknown program with zero chance of beating a national championship contender; the Trojans have enough talent that they could very well stick with Alabama. Regardless of the week one result, the Trojans will continue to draw top recruits and be a factor in the college football landscape. Head coach Clay Helton is not going to call out Nick Saban publicly or go for a 2-point conversion with a large fourth quarter lead just to rub salt in the wound (though honestly, we all want to see both of those things happen). 
In actuality, despite the inflated coverage by this paper and other outlets of the “biggest season opener in USC history,” no one knows what ramifications this game might have on Helton’s coaching career and USC football as a whole.
That’s where the Trojans could learn from their Northern California counterparts — that one win could not only shape legacies, but also build a new era. Stanford’s upset of USC in 2007 kickstarted a decade-long run of success for the Cardinal that is still going, even after Harbaugh left in 2011.
The Trojans have been searching for an opportunity like this since Carroll’s departure: a chance to regain prominence rather than disappointing just enough to come up short of expectations, with an uncanny string of controversies mixed in year after year.
There was the Reggie Bush fiasco, Lane Kiffin on the tarmac, Pat Haden on the sideline, Josh Shaw pulling the hero’s version of Ryan Lochte and Steve freakin’ Sarkisian. And as a result of the past decade’s run of sanctions, rogue coaches and general dysfunction (as we speak, the University is somehow allowing suspended sophomore linebacker Osa Masina to practice with the team despite his involvement in multiple alleged sexual assault investigations), the Trojans in 2016 are likely to spend more time near the bottom or out of the Top 25 rankings instead of at the top.
That would not be the new era USC fans are hoping for; it would be continuing the slip from Rose Bowl regulars to annual invitees to the Holiday Bowl.
When it was announced two years ago that USC would open the 2016 season against Alabama, no one would have thought that the future of Trojan football would lie in the playbook of a man named Clay Helton and the hands of a first-year starter in redshirt junior quarterback Max Browne. 
Win, and Helton was the right hire, and Browne is a quarterback destined for greatness. Lose, and… well, it would be expected, bland and render this Harbaugh comparison useless. The man beat a top-ranked team, started an era of success and earned his program everlasting respect that remains strong to this day. For USC, Helton has a chance to do the same.

Photo courtesy of Sports InformationSet on the stars · Junior setter Reni Meyer-Whalley and the women’s volleyball team have three matches to earn their first win of the season.
The women’s volleyball team (0-3) will be looking for their first win of the season in the USC Radisson Classic after dropping all three matches in the USC Baden Invitational last weekend. 
“We need all three,” head coach Mick Haley said. “We need to be 3-3 after this weekend if we can.”
Last weekend was a rough start for the Women of Troy. They lost in four sets to Marquette and Santa Clara and then got swept by UC Irvine. Hitting and service errors plagued the team, totaling up 110 errors through three matches. 
“We started on Monday by saying we want Christmas to be over here,” Haley said. “We’re not in a giving mood anymore.”
Practice this week offered a fresh start in  hopes of a renewed level of play this weekend. Haley said practices have been productive. At Wednesday’s practice, everyone was working hard, cheering each other on and dialed in. 
“We’ve changed a few things, but not too much,” Haley said. “So I think we’re getting close.”
While not having starting setters is the main source of their problems on the court, the team’s youth is another component they’re dealing with. 
“I’ve got my young kids, that are wonderful athletes, having to carry a pretty big load pretty quickly in their lives,” Haley said. “But that’s what they signed up for.”
In terms of the setter battle, all four are still in contention for this weekend, but senior Alice Pizzasegola and junior Reni Meyer-Whalley “are in the driver seat” right now. 
Senior setter Alexa Strange, a two-time national champion and All-American in beach volleyball, hasn’t played organized indoor volleyball since her freshman year at Nebraska in the fall of 2012. 
“Strange is starting to come on here now, not as a setter but just as a player,” Haley said. “She’s really liking this right now.”
Junior setter Nikki Leonard is the other player in contention. Haley praised her raw athleticism and her coachability and emphasized the need to get her more relaxed on the court. 
“Leonard is showing that she can take instruction right now,” Haley said. “We just need to get her to play without making too many errors.”
For Haley, it comes down to the team finding confidence in themselves and each other for everything to start clicking on the court. 
“All they need is one person that can step up,” Haley said. “And then, we can be a team that was as good as last year’s team.”
This season, it looks like the spark plug could be freshman outside hitter Khalia Lanier. She had back-to-back double-digit kills to close out the tournament and was the only USC player to make the Baden Invitational All-Tournament team. 
“Khalia is good enough to do that, but I just don’t want to put that kind of pressure on her yet,” Haley said. “But we may have to try, because if we get ourselves in a hole here, we’re going to be in trouble.”
The team will face a higher level of competition in No. 22 Creighton (1-1), No. 23 Kentucky (2-1) and Northern Iowa (2-1) than they did last weekend in three unranked opponents. The Women of Troy have never lost to any of these teams in the 10 combined times they’ve faced them. For USC to save the start of the 2016 season, they will need to keep their perfect records against these teams. 
“So I’m pretty optimistic; I’m usually the pessimist,” Haley said. “I’m optimistic that maybe we can turn this around, you know?”
The Women of Troy kick of the USC Radisson Classic tonight night at 8 p.m. against No. 23 Kentucky. On Saturday, they face Northern Iowa at 10 a.m. and No. 22 Creighton at 8 p.m. 
Hayley’s two setter system is lame. There is no size up front. Team wins all three they deserve a medal after the
worst performance in school history.

Tal Volk | Daily TrojanIt’s game time · Junior wide receiver JuJu Smith-Schuster was named the top wide receiver in college football by NCAA.com on Wednesday. The list also included Alabama’s sophomore wide receiver Calvin Ridley.
After months of anticipation and preparation, football season begins on Saturday when No. 20 USC travels to Arlington to take on defending national champion and the undisputed No. 1 team in the country, the Alabama Crimson Tide.
Though USC has seven victories over No. 1-ranked teams in the past, they are picked to lose by double-digits according to the Las Vegas spread. Head coach Clay Helton highlighted the two main areas the team has been working on.
“Takeaways and ball security,” Helton said. “We spent a lot of time in practice just focusing on our individual fundamentals and techniques.”
While the outside world has questioned the readiness of USC’s defense in facing a well-oiled machine in the Crimson Tide, the team is confident that it is ready for the challenge.
“I think people aren’t aware of us yet,” sophomore defensive tackle Noah Jefferson said. “We have a lot of talent. We did a lot of hard work this offseason.”
The defensive line is not the only defensive unit that will have their hands full. Junior cornerback and returner Adoree’ Jackson will be matched up against a man he compared to former USC All-American Nelson Agholor — Alabama sophomore wide receiver Calvin Ridley. Due to Jackson’s responsibilities on defense, his role on offense will be limited, however, he will remain the Trojans’ primary returner.
Redshirt senior left tackle Chad Wheeler is still dealing with plantar fasciitis, an inflammation of the tissue near the heel, but Helton is expecting to use Wheeler in a few series. Helton said he was very fortunate with the team’s injury situation and described it as very healthy.
Also on the offensive line, Helton is expecting redshirt sophomore Chris Brown and junior Damien Mama to split time at left guard.
“They’ve both had terrific camps, and it will help keep us fresh,” Helton said.
As far as coaching is concerned, offensive coordinator and play caller Tee Martin and defensive line coach Kenechi Udeze will be the primary coaches in the press box. Martin is expected to be an aggressive play caller.
“I expect great things from him, I really do,” Helton said. “He believes the run sets up the pass. When you throw the ball, look for explosive plays. We’re of the same mindset.”
This will be the first meeting between the two teams since 1985, and USC has not played an SEC team in 10 years. USC has won its last 17 season openers, while Alabama has won its last 14. With many younger players opening their collegiate careers on the biggest stage in the country, Helton shared his advice on keeping their nerves low.
“Do your job one play at a time and don’t get caught up in the grandness of the stage or the opponent that you’re playing,” Helton said. “You’ve played great players all through training camp, you’re going to play great players on Saturday; how do you win ball games? You do your job.”

This past January, Harvard University published a report detailing the cultural message received by high school students that personal success is more important than concern for community service, involvement and a genuine interest in helping other people. When it comes to applying for college, concern for the common good and other people is drowned out in the race to gather as many accolades as possible. The report describes how often the college admissions structure itself contributes to this problem. However, Harvard contends that college admissions is in a unique position of power to send messages that contrast those of existing selfishness.     
 The study, and its overall message, is absolutely correct: In a time when economic inequality exerts the greatest effect on the American landscape, university admissions processes must learn to look past superficial awards tied to income and location — like AP scores or special clubs — to reward those students who redefine achievement in a way that creates greater equity and access in their communities. Thankfully, our own University actually serves as an example of this positive action. More universities should adopt USC’s mission to increase campus diversity by using a more holistic approach to admissions, that emphasize other aspects than test scores and traditional extracurricular activities. 
The report takes up three challenges — how college admissions can motivate high school students to contribute to others in more authentic and meaningful ways, more meaningfully assess students’ contributions to their communities and redefine achievements that level the playing field for economically disadvantaged students. Moreover, Harvard suggests a decreased emphasis on standardized testing, which reflects a growing movement in higher education toward making assessments optional in an effort to reduce the pressure to earn high scores. In fact, studies are largely inconclusive about the correlation between SAT scores and success in college — what is more verified is that SAT scores can be linked to income inequality, where wealthier students are more likely to earn high scores that are appealing to admissions counselors than poorer students, with no real prediction of how they’ll perform in a college course. 
Although it still accepts standardized test scores, USC, among other universities, has fully embraced Harvard’s call for an admissions process to admit students who demonstrate care for their communities and an emphasis on admitting students from economically diverse backgrounds, who may have been previously overlooked during the admissions process.
 In many communities, students lack access to key academic opportunities and resources, such as Advanced Placement courses or extracurricular activities, and instead are expected to vitally contribute to their families in ways that are not measured by traditional admissions processes — also a form of community involvement. So far as our own University’s admissions system goes, it appears these needs have been taken into account. As USC Provost Michael Quick noted in a luncheon with first-generation college students who had recently moved into campus housing, the skills these students already possess from their life experiences put them ahead at USC — and are skills he hopes all students possess by the time they graduate. He specifically points out skills these students have utilized for years, “How to make the right decisions with limited information, how to deal with failure. How to motivate yourself, how to care about others, how to give back to make society better than it is today.” 
Overall, the admissions process at universities within the United States should change the way they examine extracurricular activities and alter their admissions requirements to emphasize a greater commitment to students’ communities. By examining non-traditional activities like family commitments or meaningful volunteer engagements, universities can greater expand opportunities to first generation college students or students from economically diverse backgrounds. Moreover, by emphasizing quality involvement with activities over quantity, and decreasing the importance of standardized exams like the SAT or ACT, universities can lessen the pressure on high school seniors to overextend themselves.

Former Stanford swimmer and convicted rapist Brock Turner is set to be released from prison Friday after a brief three-month stint behind bars for the sexual assault of an unconscious woman. The case, which jump-started a media firestorm calling for harsher sentences for convicted sexual predators, began an important discussion of  the double standard university athletes are treated within the justice system. 
It seemed like after Turner’s case we had all learned a lesson. We all vowed that never again would we let a Brock Turner slip  through the cracks, and we all assumed our universities would take notice. But, we were wrong.
This week, it was announced that USC linebacker Osa Masina is facing a one-game suspension due to an ongoing investigation into two separate instances of sexual assault in California and Utah. TMZ reported Thursday night that according to an obtained search warrant, Masina drugged and raped a woman twice in the apartment of fellow USC football player Don Hill. He also uploaded pictures of the assault to Snapchat.  Not only does the one-game suspension seem light on the surface, but Masina was also present at the team practice on Wednesday, where head coach Clay Helton refused to comment on the suspension decision except to say the team was handling the situation in accordance with the University’s instructions. 
USC had an opportunity when faced with this incident to show that they had learned from the egregious miscarriage of justice in the Turner case, to show that they take sexual assault seriously enough to indefinitely suspend Masina until the cases are sorted out. But instead, Masina gets a slap on the wrist, sitting out a single game.
USC’s decision not to indefinitely suspend Masina is unsettling given the close proximity to the Turner case. But when one closely examines how other universities handle sexual assault investigations of players, USC’s treatment of the matter  becomes outright disturbing. 
Just last week, the University of Oregon indefinitely suspended football player Torrodney Prevot in the midst of a physical assault investigation by local police and the University.  Not only that, Prevot was excluded from the Oregon’s depth chart and the university released a statement that his status as a student-athlete was under review. And in May, University of Minnesota basketball player Reggie Lynch was banned from all team engagements pending the investigation into charges of sexual assault.
These examples prove that not only was USC within its rights to indefinitely suspend Masina from team activities pending the sexual assault investigations, but other universities had set a precedent of doing so.
In many cases of campus sexual assault, the university is one of the only pathways to justice. The standard of evidence at many universities, including USC, is a preponderance of the evidence, meaning that the accused only has to be proven “more likely than not” to have committed the infraction. In a criminal case, the accused has to be proven to have committed the crime “beyond a reasonable doubt.” 
In May, Boise State football players Marquis Hendrix and Donzale Roddie were expelled and Darreon Jackson was suspended following the university’s sexual assault investigation. In the case, a female student reported she had been forced to perform oral sex on the accused as well as an official recruit. Though criminal charges were never filed, the university’s investigation led to real ramifications. Not a one-game suspension, but a little slice of justice that our criminal justice system was not equipped to provide. 
When our criminal justice system failed the woman that Brock Turner assaulted, Stanford University and USA Swimming served him a lifetime ban. When USC was faced with a sexual assault investigation, it chose leniency over drawing a hard line, a one-game suspension over sending a message that not only will sexual assault never be tolerated at USC, but that USC will serve as an ally for sexual assault survivors and adversary of sexual assault culture everywhere. 
Instead, USC chose to send an entirely different message — a message that should disappoint and offend not only the entire USC community, but also the higher education community at large that strives for campuses where sexual assault is eradicated and students do not have to compromise their safety in their pursuit of education.
Daily Trojan Fall 2016 Editorial Board
The first version of this article stated that Torrodney Prevot was under investigation for sexual assault, it has been changed to reflect he is under investigation for physical assault. The Daily Trojan regrets the error.
Did you ever hear that a person is presumed innocent until proven guilty in a court of law?  Indefinite suspension is a harsh sentence when the case is still in the investigation stage.  Sorry, I am not on your bandwagon.
Dear AUTHOR of this article.  Get your facts straight.  Although both are dispicable, Torrodney Prevot is being investigated for PHYSICAL assault.  NOT sexual assault.

I have never truly been “single,” unless you want to count middle school and any time before that. Middle school Danielle — brace-faced, basketball shorts everyday — was the definition of #singleAF. So until everyone starts considering their middle school Xanga relationships as serious ones, I’m not counting.
Up until the most recent season of my life, I never fully embraced the state of being single. Since high school; there was always one guy or, to be real, a multitude of “interests.” My friends loved hearing me describe my new dates as if they were part of a monthly, semi-monthly or even bi-weekly newsletter subscription. My dating trends also always followed these guidelines — nothing would last longer than three months, he had to be from a different school or major, and we would never have the same ethnic background.
If dating could be compared to eating Skittles, my experience would be similar to tasting the rainbow … of culture. But if dating was actually like this, then Skittles would need to add more flavors to its packages. The guys I dated were of a myriad of ethnicities — Korean, black, Japanese, Filipino, white, Vietnamese, Mexican and Cambodian, just to name a few. 
Cross-cultural dating is awesome. I love having cross-cultural interactions while still laughing about similar experiences of over-protective mothers or that one embarrassing uncle. But many times, it doesn’t start so sweet. Oftentimes, my first encounters with guys usually begin with, “What’s your ethnic background?”
Or, more likely, “You’re pretty — are you (insert any Asian but my real ethnic background here)?”
Or, sometimes, “You’re so beautiful, what are you?” 
Or, rarely, “Where are you from?” often followed by, “No, like where are you from from?” because repeating the last word lets me know what you’re really asking. 
The encounters I listed are only moderate within the scale of approaches toward me as an Asian woman. Don’t let me start on the commentary I get through social apps. But why is it that the majority of men who approach me try to assess me through my ethnic face? 
To be clear, I don’t think that the basis of asking my cultural background is wrong. I think it’s wonderful to want to get to know someone and their ethnic background. Learning about someone’s upbringing and the role of culture and tradition in growing up is a beautiful, intimate conversation to have with someone. Perhaps that in this age of millennial dating people are searching for the quickest means of connecting to others, trying to appease personal curiosity while simultaneously seeking to pique the interest of another. And yes, culture is an amazingly interesting factor and especially so here at USC. There is a beauty in embracing each other for our differences and identities. But as a person of color, it’s often hurtful to see this uniqueness to be used unashamedly as a quick connect or key to judgment.
Don’t tell me my smile is beautiful, because you don’t see many Asian women smiling with their teeth. Or that I have a great tan, unlike my pale sisters. Or that you love exotic eyes. You are doing a disservice to me by racially profiling my “beautiful” face. 
I know that I am not alone when it comes to being exoticized and fetishized as an Asian woman. I consistently see it, whether it be in a bar Downtown on a Friday night or through my friend’s Tinder message inbox. There is more to me than my almond shaped-eyes and jet black hair. There is more to my background than just my common surname. But are my Asian features the only interest? 
Yes, culture is beautiful. Yes, it’s OK to ask. But let’s keep it tasteful, like Skittles, because judging me by my ethnic appearance isn’t beautiful or flattering.

Photo courtesy of The Head and the HeartMind, body and soul · Signs of Light is set for release next Friday. The Head and the Heart follow up the succcess of a hit single and appearance on HBO’s Roadies with a contemporary album.
For a band with such memorable music, it’s strange to think that Signs of Light will only be The Head and The Heart’s third album. The release, which will be available Friday, Sept. 9.
The Head and the Heart’s self-titled first album was filled with beautiful harmonies, lyrics that would fit right in in a Hemingway or Fitzgerald work and a classic sound that seemed to reminisce on multiple eras all at once. The follow up album Let’s Be Still saw the band polish up their sound and add more joyful beats behind their songs. This time around, The Head and The Heart seemed to have expanded their sound to something more contemporary. Longtime fans need not worry though, the band still effortlessly maintains its beat café folk style.
The single, “All We Ever Knew” is followed by “Library Magic,” a more brooding melody backed by a soft percussion. The vocal harmonies mesh perfectly, allowing the listener to hear every voice but never be quite sure how many voices there are. The new album is an interesting departure from the lyrics of the band’s first album. Its musical evolution seems to have led to more concise lyrics. The words, especially when sung, still pack the same beautiful and ethereal punch, but they’re able to do so with more grounded and simple lyrics. The next single is “Colors,” with whispering vocals and lingering strings. The vulnerability presents the song as a moment in time rather than a recorded product. The sparse use of female vocalist Charity Thielen only empowers lead singer Josiah Johnson’s pain that much more. When Thielen does come in for her own verse, it’s a delicate voice offering hope against Johnson’s yearning. The instruments act, as they do in most of the band’s songs, as another vocalist seamlessly mimicking the melody and harmonies.
The most recent single, “Rhythm & Blues,” is a contemporary indie folk hit — imagine Nada Surf gone folk. Like the other singles, “Rhythm & Blues” doesn’t need a fast beat to keep the listener engaged. While it wouldn’t work as a rave banger or a selection of a frat party playlist, it’s the kind of music that soundtracks a road trip with friends or a much needed day of swaying around in your room by yourself.
The Head and the Heart have mastered the ability to be multiple things at once. There are multiple levels to every song. The lyrics often talk about heartbreak or the past, the emotion twirls between longing and acceptance. The music is perfect to daydream along with but can also be the perfect acoustic dance party soundtrack. Signs of Light is an example of what all artists should hope for their third album — a continuation of their artistic vision while challenging their comfort zones.
The band is on tour until Feb. 8 and will stop in Los Angeles to play the Greek Theatre on Oct. 7.

This past weekend, I found myself at FYF Fest. The music festival, which also happened to be right in USC’s backyard at Exposition Park, was exceptional, yet also rather challenging, as I treaded the event partially in a wheelchair and partially on crutches. I didn’t let a torn ACL stop me from experiencing one of the best ways to end summer. With that being said, there are a few things to keep in mind when attending a music festival that I learned at FYF.
First of all, wear shoes with support because those cute strappy sandals will not do you any good. Tennis shoes were a go-to at FYF this year with the large amounts of walking (or in my case, crutching). It’s definitely possible to be stylish and practical, it just takes a keen eye. What’s not practical is wearing a Native American headdress at a festival — which I guess is still a thing considering I witnessed it over the weekend. Don’t be that guy. 
Weather is a super important factor to consider, especially since it can easily make or break your experience. Be prepared, my friends – it could be sweltering hot during the day then start to snow at night. Always be ready with a quick pullover or flannel. With weather comes sun and with sun comes sunburns. Take advantage of the sunscreen your mom made you bring to college because, without it, you will crash and burn and wish you had listened. Mom is always right.
Also, don’t forget to try the food. This is a big one; there are so many magical options for your taste buds that you never could’ve possibly imagined. Hate cauliflower? You won’t after you try it fried with buffalo sauce. This weekend I had the pleasure of enjoying four different popsicles, yes four – I have no boundaries, ranging from raspberry basil to sea salt chocolate. Let’s not forget the pad thai. Let me tell you, the pad thai was actually rad thai. It’s not a music festival until you try the food. Good music and delicious sustenance make for a vital combo. 
It’s not about how close you are to the stage, as long as you’re there experiencing the sound and vibrations coming from the musicians who are performing. I think it’s necessary to remember this because we sometimes are so enthralled by a band that we try to get to the very front to really see them as people and not as artists. When I saw Tame Impala and Kendrick Lamar, I was relatively far away but hearing them live along with the visuals they projected made it an amazing experience. If you’re dying to see your favorite band next year, definitely push to the front, but don’t feel down if you can’t make it five feet away from them. Music is about listening and dancing and feeling. It’s about the way you experience it.
Lastly and most importantly, be safe! Drugs are real! Alcohol is real! Do what you want to do, but be mindful and aware of the risks. The last thing anyone wants is for someone to seriously injure themselves or the people around them because of substance abuse. Listen, I’m not trying to sound like your mom or the D.A.R.E. Program (what ever happened to that?), but just be careful. Make sure someone is there for you and has your back.
Music festivals are meant not to be about showing off or trying to impress anyone. Be yourself and take in the culture that surrounds you. I met so many kind people, both attendees and workers at FYF. Don’t be shy about making friends, you might even run into Mac DeMarco (who yes, was walking around the FYF grounds!). Having an open mind when going into a festival is essential for experiencing new things, new foods, and new music. Fall in love with your surroundings and be open to the endless possibilities. This year’s FYF Fest was a total success for me, and I can’t wait for what’s to come next year.

At the University of Southern California, there are a few different incarnations of prestige. They reside in athletic tradition, celebrity donations, high-profile speakers, a couple of stellar undergraduate programs, and USC’s status as a top-tier research institution. This is not an exhaustive list, but it is illustrative of how we measure worth at our school. I can tell you where to find the George Lucas Building, or the Iovine and Young Academy; I can tell you about when I saw Bill Clinton speak in Bovard Auditorium; I can show you the Heisman trophies in Heritage Hall (including O.J. Simpson’s); I can give you the U.S. Report rankings on the Annenberg School for Journalism & Communication and the Thornton School of Music. And yet, I know nothing about the research that goes on within the 0.353125 square miles of our campus.
It takes but a cursory exploration of USC’s research website to see some of the fascinating projects that are currently in the works by faculty and students alike. Among the headlines today:
     –We are not alone: Fish get arthritis, too
     –USC stem cell researchers develop new ways to study ‘organs on a chip’
     –Engineers try to get to the heart of real love
The university should be, first and foremost, a place of learning. We come here to earn a degree, yes, but also for exposure to ideas that can’t necessarily be accessed by the general public. Our understanding of education has shifted amidst an explosion of open-source learning, and the ensuing democratization of information. However, the fact remains that we are as close to the cutting edge of discovery as we could hope to be. Why are we not taking full advantage of this privilege?
