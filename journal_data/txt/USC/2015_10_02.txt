In 1977, Roger Waters was angry. The bassist and co-frontman of Pink Floyd had experienced, along with the rest of his bandmates, a meteoric rise to rock-stardom in a short four years. In 1973, Pink Floyd released one of rock’s most iconic and beloved albums, Dark Side of the Moon. Two years later, they released another one of rock’s most iconic and beloved albums, Wish You Were Here. The band that once played small gigs in underground London nightclubs was now packing stadiums and dazzling hundreds of thousands of fans with their distinct brand of rock and complex pyrotechnics.
So why then was Waters so dissatisfied? What could have been the source of the fury that produced Animals, Pink Floyd’s beautifully cynical 10th studio album?
It had everything to do with Britain’s developing socioeconomic problems in the late ‘70s. Waters, like many rock musicians of the era, had a marked disdain for anything (and anybody) that had to do with authority and greed. And Britain, in Waters’ view, was becoming increasingly authoritarian and materialistic. His country was being consumed by what he believed to be capitalism’s ugliest depravities. Worse yet, Waters felt like he was contributing to this emerging culture; Pink Floyd was, after all, one of the most commercially successful acts of the 1970s.
And so Waters took his bitterness and guilt, and — in typical Pink Floyd fashion — created a conceptual masterpiece.
Animals was released in the United Kingdom on Jan. 23, 1977, marking another classic installment in Pink Floyd’s impressive discography. Critics were initially shocked by the album’s harshness — in fact, some were made downright uncomfortable by the album’s relentless pessimism. 
Indeed, Animals was a striking departure from Pink Floyd’s previous two records. Musically, the album adopts elements of punk, which was flourishing during the late ‘70s. Where Dark Side and Wish You Were Here (great individual works in their own right) were spacey, tight and sometimes jazzy, Animals was piercing, manic and cluttered.
Still, Pink Floyd put their distinct sonic stamp — which synthesizes blues influences with innovative electronic soundscapes — on Animals. And though the album is Waters’ brainchild, it would be nothing without the talent and vision of Pink Floyd’s three other members.
David Gilmour puts together a masterful guitar performance, probably his most impressive on a Pink Floyd album. He showcases a new glassy strat sound that is fundamental to the album’s penetrating instrumentals. On “Dogs,” a 17-minute tour de force, Gilmour graces listeners with incredibly emotional harmonized leads and an innovative, pulsating rhythm part on acoustic guitar. With that song alone, Gilmour puts himself in a league of his own. On the next track, “Pigs (Three Different Ones),” Gilmour manipulates his guitar with a talk box to make his solos sound like a pig squealing. That is the type of artistry that distinguishes Pink Floyd from other bands.
Keyboardist Rick Wright’s contribution to Animals is also (as always) invaluable. Wright’s synth and keyboard parts are thin and hollow, low hanging and ominous. On “Dogs,” Wright is able to create synths that mimic the sound of a mosquito, relentlessly buzzing in and out of the listener’s ears. Also on “Dogs,” Wright distorts a Hammond organ to imitate the sound of dogs barking. Yet another example of Pink Floyd pushing sonic boundaries on “Animals.”
Conceptually, the album is a scathing denunciation of a system that was morally bankrupt  in Waters’ eyes. Waters based the concept loosely on George Orwell’s Animal Farm. There are three songs — all over 10 minutes — at the center of the album, bookended by two brief but powerful parts of what is essentially the same song. (This unusual album structure bears resemblance to “Wish You Were Here.”)
The three main songs – “Dogs,” “Pigs (Three Different Ones)” and “Sheep” — each take on a different societal or economic institution. “Dogs” is a harrowing account of the cannibalistic and ravenous nature of businessmen trying to get ahead in the corporate world. It is a perturbing and powerful tale about gaining and losing control, about being a pack animal that finds himself dying alone. (Waters was clearly not an optimistic man during his 30s.)
“Pigs (Three Different Ones)” is a merciless assault on figures of British authority. Waters shows particular contempt for socially conservative leader Mary Whitehouse (whom he calls out by name), calling her a “house proud town mouse.”
“Sheep” serves as a conclusion of sorts to the three-song string at the heart of the album. Waters describes the “sheep” that are encouraged to overtake the “dogs,” but who are only told in the end to stay inside and follow orders when the revolution is complete. Waters completes his criticism of British society by condemning the complacency of the people, which has allowed the dogs and pigs to flourish.
I have barely scratched the surface of Animals complexity. It is an overwhelming yet supremely listenable album made by a band at the height of their creative power. One does not have to agree with Waters’ message to appreciate the sheer power this album delivers.  
Nima Aminian is a junior majoring in economics. His column, Classics’ Corner, runs every other Thursday.
Two of the songs were already in concert playlists since 1974. So this is not exactly new materials created for the purpose of this album. But the lyrics were mosly rewritten wrt the social context in 1976.
As far as i know, rick wright is not credited as a compositor on this album.
I am not sure why. His situation in the band was already pretty bad in 1976. But given the fact that a lot of material comes from before 1975, i am pretty sure he was involved in the composition at that time.
The wikipedia page mentions some other art proposals for the album cover. I would love to see them, they are all very … politically incorrect :)

Christina Nursalim | Daily Trojan
When was the last time you actually read something for pleasure? Many of you might have forgotten the pleasure of reading because you’ve been too caught up reading assigned books for school (or maybe just reading Buzzfeed articles or watching Netflix and Youtube). However, I find comfort in the covers of a well-worn book and I want to help you rediscover the pleasure of reading. I urge you to peruse the pages of a couple of books at your nearest bookstore and pick up one that catches your eye. Or if you don’t have the time to search for a good book, here are some of my suggestions that will make for the perfect companion during a lazy Sunday with a cup of tea.
1. We Were Liars
We Were Liars is one of the best books I’ve read this year. Written by National Book Award finalist E. Lockhart, We Were Liars was also voted as the Goodreads Choice 2014 winner. We Were Liars is relatively thin so you can definitely rip through it (I know I did) in about a day. It is easy to read and is filled with suspense — a true page-turner. The novel is about an 18-year-old girl who suffers from crippling migraines and memory loss ever since an accident that she can no longer remember. The book vividly portrays her poignant journey as she tries to recollect her lost memories, and tries to find out the truth behind her accident. I won’t say anymore because I don’t want to give out any spoilers. So, just like the book review says, “Read it. And if anyone asks you how it ends, just lie.”
2. S
If you’re into mysteries and interactive reading, S. is definitely the book for you. S. is a novel written by Doug Dorst. The story plot was conceived by J.J. Abrams, director of Star Trek and many other award-winning films such Mission Impossible and Star Wars: The Force Awakens. The book has a very interesting concept that makes it a story within a story. The book itself is produced to look like a library book with the title “Ship of Theseus.” Within the book, there are notes in the margins written by two students passing the book back and forth between them and exchanging their thoughts and ideas. They seek to uncover the elusive identity of V. M. Straka, the fictional author of the “Ship of Theseus,” as well as to unravel the mysteries of the novel, which is about a man who has no memories and is shanghaied onto a boat with an eccentric and creepy crew (the sailors lips are sewn together).
The book also has a lot of supplemental materials slipped in between its pages, such as napkins with drawings on it, newspaper clippings, postcards, a decoder and more. It makes it seem as if the students have put these materials in the book as they were discussing it with each other. One challenge I had while reading the book is that it is a little time consuming and difficult to read just because there are so many things going on. However, it’s definitely an interesting and interactive concept that is enjoyable to read. If you like mysteries or if you want to try your hand with a new reading experience, I’d definitely recommend it.
3. Crazy Rich Asians
Written by Kevin Kwan, Crazy Rich Asians is a fun, light read filled with satirical humor and packed with drama. A fictional expose into the lives of —quite literally — crazy rich Asians, this novel is sure to leave you in equal parts of laughter and horror at the ludicrous things these characters will do to protect their own social status.
The fictional story is about Nicholas Young, Asia’s most eligible bachelor, and his girlfriend, plain-Jane Rachel Chu. Nicholas brings Rachel back to Singapore to attend his best friend’s wedding, which turns out to be the biggest wedding in all of Asia. Rachel meets Nicholas’ family, who disapproves of her because she is not on their level in terms of wealth. Crazy Rich Asians gives readers an inside look beyond the veneer of the picturesque lives these characters try to portray to the public, allowing readers to see the dysfunction in these “crazy rich” families. Though the book centers on the loaded topic of dysfunctional families, Kevin Kwan cleverly writes his novel with humorous honesty that keeps the novel fresh and exciting. The novel gives a whole new perspective on dysfunctional families and shows that even the most seemingly perfect family has its secrets.
So, the next time you have some free time to unwind and de-stress from midterm season, don’t just rely on Netflix. Pick up a book, brew your favorite cup of tea, curl up in your favorite couch and immerse yourself back into the long-lost pastime of reading. Let your mind escape into the lives of different people and into different worlds for a little magical while.

Little Tokyo boasts many fun activities. Cody Uyeda | Daily Trojan
L.A. is known around the world as the city of international crossroads and cultural diversity, but how often have you visited the little enclaves that actually make L.A. the diverse and interesting place we know and love? One of these places is Little Tokyo, the home base of the mainland Japanese-American community. It’s home to the annual Nisei Week festival, as well as the world famous Japanese-American National Museum, but for the average student, it’s also a great place to come hang out and explore.
You may be thinking, “This all sounds good, but how do I even get there?” For the car-less student, getting around L.A. can seem like a daunting task. However, Little Tokyo is particularly easy to get to because it sits directly on a Metro line. First, catch the Expo Line from the Jefferson/USC station behind the Galen Center, and take it to the 7th Street station. From there, transfer onto either the Red or Purple Line to Union Station. Once there, take the Gold Line one stop over to the Little Tokyo/Arts District stop.
And, now that you’re there, here are five things that every visitor should do in Little Tokyo:
1. Eat some ramen
This one might seem a little obvious, but ramen really is one of the staples of Japanese-American cuisine and for good reason. Whether you prefer a traditional joint like Daikokuya, or you’re more of a Shin Sen Gumi type of person, nothing beats the taste of ramen on a sunny California afternoon.
2. See a play at East West Players
As one of the oldest Asian-American theaters in the U.S., East West Players hosts a yearly schedule of plays that focus on promoting issues of Asian-American culture and identity, as well as fostering bridges of understanding between the East and West. The shows are usually in the evening, so if you have free night in your schedule, go check it out.
3. Taste some traditional sweets at Fugetsu-Do Confectionary
Family owned since 1903, Fugetsu-Do confectionary is Little Tokyo’s go-to place for any and all traditional sweets. They carry seasonal variations of mochi, wagashi and manju that you’d be hard pressed to find anywhere else, and no trip to Little Tokyo would be complete without making a stop here. To enjoy these sweets is what it really means to engage with the tastes of traditional Japanese culture.
4. Try an Imagawayaki
For those not in the know, the front window of Mitsuru Café in Little Tokyo specializes in making a type of traditional sweet known as Imagawayaki. In simple terms, it’s a fluffy, hot, pancake-like sweet with sweet red-bean filling inside. This simple description doesn’t do it justice, but it is another must-do when visiting Little Tokyo.
5. Gather your thoughts at the James Irvine Japanese Garden
Lastly, after a long day, come sit and relax by the James Irvine Japanese Garden — Little Tokyo’s hidden gem. Tucked away behind the Aratani Theater, the garden soothes with the rustle of wind through bamboo, and the gentle rippling of its perpetually flowing stream and pond. It’s the perfect place to escape from the bustle of L.A.’s concrete metropolis and really take a moment to appreciate all that Little Tokyo is.

Being about to travel around the U.S., far her home in Hong Kong has made exchange student Grace Lam more independent. Grace Lam | Daily Trojan
I can’t believe it, but it has already been just over a month since I arrived in Los Angeles. Time flies, and it is already midterm week, but I feel like exchange student orientation was yesterday. 
I know that a lot of USC students — especially the Marshall students whom I have met in the past month — are thinking about doing a semester abroad in Asia or Europe; some of them have already been accepted to an exchange program. If you ask me, I would definitely recommend studying abroad.  You will never know how much you can grow if you don’t take the initiative to try it yourself. 
For me, doing a semester abroad has already made me more independent and open to new experiences. In Hong Kong, even if I was living in a dorm on campus, I could travel back home, a one-hour drive away, once a week. Dining options were very cheap and easily accessible by public transportation, and there was simply no need to cook for myself. However, going abroad meant I had to start grocery shopping for myself, sometimes cooking at night and planning ahead in order to save money for travelling. Thought the living style of each country varies, regardless of your destination it will definitely be an eye-opening experience.
Another highlight for every exchange students is traveling. As a student — especially if you are only transferring the credits back, not the grades — you have the privilege to make ambitious travel plans. If you are heading to another continent for an exchange program, make sure you visit as many cities and countries as possible as you never know if you will have the chance to stay in the region for six months without working in the future. For me, I have Fridays off and have often made use of the long weekend to plan trips to nearby attractions. I have been to many L.A. beaches, San Francisco, Las Vegas, the Grand Canyon and many more. I am also planning to go to Mexico, Canada, the East Coast and other South American countries before my exchange semester ends. Start planning early so you can manage your time well, and leave room in your schedule for other commitments like group meetings.
Overall, embrace a journey of self-discovery as you spend more and more time away from your homeland, and discover new and joyful experiences abroad.If you have the chance to go abroad, take it and enjoy.

I have a dream that all humanity will one day learn to use parallel structure properly. The only problem is that I’m currently stuck in a classroom, listening to my Chinese history professor ramble about Ying-Yang hexagrams, am writing about parallel structure and haven’t taken notes as I really should be. 
Unfortunately, these relatable student problems are not the fundamental problem in the previous sentence. What’s even more wrong than a student not paying attention in class is a writer not following parallel structure. 
Broadly defined, parallel structure functions to improve clarity through consistency and balance in sentence construction. As a copy editor and rookie grammar police, my job is to catch and correct the delinquent sentences. So, here goes the correction: I’m currently sitting in a classroom, listening to my Chinese history professor, writing about parallel structure and not taking notes as I probably should be. 
Here’s the thing about parallel structure: No one really cares about it (unless you’re studying for the SAT or working as a copy editor). The mismatched verb tenses often go unnoticed in spoken language and no one bothers to correct it, ultimately creating a perpetual cycle of parallel structure misuse both in speech and writing. This ignorance needs to change because what people don’t realize is that parallel structure changes the way others perceive you.
When used properly, pre-set parallel structure makes you sound smarter than you probably are. Your writing will demand respect, and your professor will offer that respect in the form of a good grade. 
I sometimes boast, “Years of learning to survive as a mediocre student have perfected not only my multi-tasking skills in lecture but also my selective-hearing skills (a.k.a. I only listen to the important stuff).” The pre-set structure here — not only x but also y — is used properly because x and y share the same grammatical construction. Using fancy structures like not only x but also y, more x than y and neither x nor y,  prove to professors you’re capable of articulating complex relationships between variables. But make sure they’re used correctly, or they might backfire and make you look like a complete idiot. 
It’s safe to say that Martin Luther King Jr. and I have at least one common point; we both have dreams, only his dream for racial harmony is much nobler than my dream for universal parallel-structure awareness. It’s unlikely that MLK would have risen to such high fame had he not repeated the famous line “I have a dream.” This illustrates that repetition through parallel structure has the power to create a resonating persuasive effect that goes down in history.
Whether you’re dying to get an “A” on that paper or trying to make your mark in history, parallel structure will help you get there. All you have to do is understand the basic grammatical structures and remain vigilant when writing. 
I’ve come to the conclusion that there’s only one fitting way to conclude this rant about parallel structure: I have a dream that one day universal parallel-structure awareness will become everyone’s dream.
