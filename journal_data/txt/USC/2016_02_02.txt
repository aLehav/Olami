When Michelle Wolzinger joined Lemonade Day back in her freshman year at George Washington University, she was taken by the organization’s mission to empower youth and inspire them to become entrepreneurs. When she transferred to USC a year later, she set out to bring Lemonade Day to Los Angeles.
Lemonade Day is a nationwide program that teaches youth how to start, own and operate their own business, starting from a lemonade stand. It began in Houston, Texas, in 2007 and since then has launched in more than 50 cities across America.
“I fell in love with the program after getting to know some of the kids on a really personal level,” Wolzinger recalled. “It was so amazing to see the light bulb go off in their heads as they realized how they could potentially change their own lives.”
Wolzinger, who is a junior majoring in business administration, started making plans to bring Lemonade Day to USC’s campus last year. She met with James Ellis, the dean of the USC Marshall School of Business, to discuss program logistics and invited other students to be part of her team.
Emily Lowe, a freshman majoring in business administration, is one of ten members who currently sits on Wolzinger’s executive board.
“I was initially attracted to Lemonade Day because it offers such a unique youth program,” Lowe said. “As the [vice president] of university relations, I am responsible for recruiting new membership and getting the word out. This semester, we participated in the involvement fair, conducted interviews, and now we have our first 50 or so mentors.”
In preparation for the business classes they will be teaching in March, USC mentors have already started training and developing their lessons. Each student will also receive an official entrepreneur workbook with 14 lesson plans, including how to set goals, create a product, make a profit and give back to the community.
“The lessons will eventually culminate with an official ‘Lemonade Day’ on April 23,” Wolzinger said. “All of the kids who went through the program will get the chance to run their own Lemonade Stand using the skills they’ve accumulated through their lessons.”
In addition to the showcase day April 23, there will be a tasting competition at USC the weekend before. Wolzinger’s co-founder and business partner Jason Reuben is in charge of organizing the event and bringing in celebrity judges such as the Laker Girls.
Wolzinger credits Reuben as a key player in her quest to expand Lemonade Day. A local tech entrepreneur and Babson College alumnus, Reuben had the same dream of bringing Lemonade Day to Los Angeles, so the partnership was a perfect match.
“My history with Lemonade Day dates back to 2014, when I was on the Board of Overseers at my alma mater,” Reuben said. “A fellow alum reached out to me about the program, and I was immediately drawn to it because of my passion for early entrepreneurship education.”
Before meeting Wolzinger, Reuben worked diligently to get the program going in Los Angeles, but the biggest thing that held him back was not having a solid team.
“For one and a half years, I flew to Houston for workshops, met with people around the nation and even contacted the Chamber of Commerce, but it wasn’t until I was introduced to Michelle that my vision started coming to life,” Reuben said.
As co-founders and business partners, Reuben and Wolzinger each have their own role and responsibilities. Wolzinger is the city director who manages day-to-day operations, while Reuben is the city champion who represents the face of the organization and does all the brand marketing.
The duo is extremely excited about launching their program for the first time this year, but they also acknowledge the work ahead of them.
“Short term, I want to raise more money and recruit more students of course,” Wolzinger said. “But my business plan doesn’t stop after college. Eventually, I want to set up a program at every university, so that every surrounding neighborhood will have their own Lemonade Day program and community of young entrepreneurs.”

Adjunct faculty voted Tuesday to unionize in two of three schools considering the action, according to the Los Angeles Times. Faculty at the Roski School of Art and Design and USC International Academy voted to join the Service Employees International Union Local 721, which represents public service workers across Southern California. Faculty at the Dornsife College of Letters, Arts and Sciences rejected the move.
In November, approximately 500 nontenured faculty members representing the three schools filed a petition with the National Labor Relations Board, asking to join the bargaining unit. The NLRB evaluated the petition and the University’s response, and conducted a survey to determine which faculty members would be included in the union. All eligible faculty were able to cast one vote; the Roski vote went through 31 to 6, and the International Academy approved the vote 32 to 3. Dornsife faculty opposed the move with 113 in favor of unionization and 127 against.
Non-tenure track faculty include lecturers, visiting professors and part-time faculty. Unlike tenure-track faculty, they are paid to teach some classes, lead discussion groups and grade papers and are not evaluated on the research they conduct. In the 2015-2016 academic year, USC employs 1,472 tenured and tenure-track faculty members and 4,265 non-tenure-track faculty, according to the Los Angeles Times.
The average salary for non-tenure track faculty at USC is $5,044 per course, according to the SEIU. Full benefits are currently offered to part-time faculty who work for at least 50 percent of the 37.5 or 40 hours per week required of full-time faculty, according to the USC benefits website. These requirements leave many faculty members taking on multiple courses in order to earn a living wage or qualify for benefits, leaving them little time for their own research.
Some non-tenure track faculty such as Kate Levin, who has taught part-time in the writing program at USC since 2011, believe that joining the union is a first step in the process of participating in a nationwide movement to improve working conditions for faculty members on college campuses.
“Having been a member of a faculty union at another school, I know how valuable it is to have a way to bargain collectively with the university over issues that matter to us and our students,” Levin said in a statement on the USC Faculty Union website.
In an email to staff members on Jan. 6, Provost Michael Quick stressed the options non-tenure track faculty members have without unionizing, such as asking for a review of their salary, working toward promotion to full-time faculty or expressing their views in the Academic Senate.
“I remain fully committed, as always, to working with each faculty member, and with the Academic Senate and other faculty governance bodies, to make USC a place where the faculty is well supported,” Quick wrote.
The move to unionize makes USC one of the largest universities with a faculty union, joining institutions such as Boston University, Georgetown University, Tufts University and Whittier College. Faculty at Whittier, who obtained a union contract in July, obtained “average pay increases of 35 percent,” according to the SEIU.

Gretchen Means began her tenure Tuesday as USC’s newly appointed Title IX Coordinator and executive director of the Office of Equity and Diversity, where she said she is striving to develop an impartial system that will accommodate all students.
“I’d like to breed some due process and to create a system and a process in which everyone feels like they’re being fairly treated and fairly vetted and fairly heard,” Means said.
Before coming to USC, Means formerly served as the sexual assault and complex litigation highly qualified expert for the western branch of the U.S. Marine Corps Legal Services Support Section. There, she worked with law enforcement and prosecutors in the region to investigate cases and bring them through the military justice process. She also developed sexual assault training and protocol for the Corps.
“I saw there was a pretty distinct similarity between what had been happening with the Marine Corps or the DOD [Department of Defense], all the military — the scrutiny that had been placed on them by the public and by Congress and by their constituencies — and felt there were a lot of parallels with colleges and what was happening in higher education,” Means said. “I felt that I could lend what I had learned and my particular expertise to the emergent challenges in the field.”
Means earned her J.D. from UC Hastings College of the Law in 1999, graduating cum laude. She worked in the San Diego District Attorney’s Office for 13 years, starting in 2000, before being recruited to work with the U.S. Marine Corps in 2013.
For seven and a half years of her time in the District Attorney’s office, she prosecuted sexual assault, human trafficking and sex-based homicides as part of the Sex Crimes Unit. She also established new methods of prosecuting gang pimping and participated in federal and state task forces to combat criminal sexual exploitation.
Means described how she plans to bring her experience with sexual assault prosecution to practice at USC when dealing with a wide spectrum of sexual assault and harassment cases, as well as when working with protected classes.
“I hope to be able to lend my expertise into negotiating those types of cases and the evidentiary cases, as well as building a system that works for all parties, for all students, whether they come here as a respondent or with a complaint,” Means said.
Student beware of anyone who worked with the military that means she knows how to protect rapist! 
Www theusmarinesrape com 
Since the Marines are the biggest group of rapist in the military she didn’t do a good job! 
Good luck to anyone that hires her!

Elizabeth Holmes probably never associated yoga and art together, much less expected them to be combined in a program. After moving to Los Angeles with her husband and son, she spent a great deal of her time collecting art, and eventually donated 29 pieces of work to what would become her museum, the Elizabeth Holmes Fisher Gallery at USC. She had one simple wish for the place: that all of their programs were free and open to the public.
It’s because of this wish that recreational athletics is collaborating with the USC Fisher Museum to provide free yoga classes every fall and spring semester. As of 2016, the program, known as Yoga with Fisher @USC, has attracted enough people to reach an eight-year milestone and is kicking off their spring session with artist Lita Albuquerque’s first showcase with the museum after 33 years — 20/20 Accelerando. The program itself is taught by composer Francois Dompierre, who has worked with the Fisher Museum in the past, including the course of the previous exhibition. Yoga this semester will be on select Tuesdays from Jan. 26 through April 10 from 10:45-11:45 a.m., with 20 spots available on a first-come, first-serve basis.
Because of its open-ended, minimal commitment and free structure, Yoga with Fisher @USC works with all schedules. People can join classes based on their own availability, and as a result, the program has managed to reach out to people of all backgrounds.
“It’s not just students that join, but also faculty and staff,” said Ani Mnatsakanyan, the education and program coordinator. “For some, this is their first experience with yoga; others are experts. This yoga class is open to anyone who wants to begin or continue their practice while getting in touch with art.”
For Kay Allen, associate director of the museum, yoga and art is an unlikely combination that helps attract more visitors.
“People average probably less than a minute in front of every work of art when they visit,” Allen said. “With this experience, they may focus on a work of art and really look at it as they’re doing their stretches, meditations and so on.”
While the yoga collaboration shifts based on every exhibition, overall, the concept is the same: to foster a meditative relationship between yoga and the arts as well as help guests spend some time away from the busy world and just concentrate on themselves and the space they’re in.
“One of my favorite parts about the program is how happy people look once the class is over,” Mnatsakanyan said. “Not only do the students get to view the exhibition in a new perspective, but they get to reflect on the art during the practice… If one hour of weekly yoga helps battle everyday stress, then our yoga program has been successful.”

The USC Community Block Party received funding at the Undergraduate Student Government Senate meeting Tuesday night. Brianna Thorpe, USG director of community affairs, presented the funding request.
The community event will take place Feb. 21 from 12 p.m. to 3 p.m., and aims to unite students with residents of local neighborhoods. Additionally, the event wants to showcase the work that USC students do to better the lives of people who live and work in the local community surrounding USC.
The Block Party would include music, family-friendly activities and food provided by local vendors such as Three World Cafe and Simply Wholesome. It would also include appearances from L.A. City Councilman Curren Price Jr., USG President Rini Sampath, and world-famous Zumba instructor Bianca Miyazaki. USG, the Environmental Student Association and Program Board will have their own booths, providing activities during the event.
Thorpe argued that the Senate funding is necessary for the public event to take place, as she had exhausted all other sources of funding, including $1,800 from Program Board.
Senator Dan Li proposed Senate provide full funding because Senate funds can’t rollover to the next semester, and also avoid forcing Thorpe to go through the bureaucratic fundraising process.
“I think we should give all the money Brianna is asking for, because we don’t get to keep any of the money we don’t use.” Li said. “We should make this process easier by funding this project today.”
Sen. Sabrina Enriquez, agreed with the point Li made earlier, highlighting the cyclical nature of funding requests within USG.
“She’ll be asking Program Board for money,” Enriquez said. “It’s all coming from the same pockets. Program Board will come to us for funding.”
The vote to fully fund the Community Block Party passed, with three votes against.
The Senate also saw presentations from the Latino Student Assembly, the Professional and Academic Funding Board, and heard of a potential resolution on making USC a smoke-free campus.

In USC’s final recruiting weekend, potential recruits tight end Devin Asiasi, safety Jamel Cook, kicker Quinn Nordin, defensive tackle Boss Tagaloa and wide receiver Keyshawn Young all made official visits to Troy, further complicating the USC recruiting situation.
Considering the Trojans have just seven of their 20 scholarships left to give, the competition is getting more heated as football’s national signing day is on Wednesday.
However, a clear distinction must be made between those players who have officially signed on to play for USC and those who have verbally committed. Verbal commits are likely to sign with USC but can change their decisions if they so decide.
As it stands right now, USC has 13 total commitments, with seven of those 13 officially signing with the University, including defensive end Wole Betiku, quarterback Matt Fink, wide receivers Josh Imatorbhebhe and Michael Pittman, defensive end Liam Jimmons, defensive back C.J. Pollard and offensive lineman Nathan Smith.
Of those who have verbally committed but not signed, are tight end Cary Angeline, linebacker Joseph Iosefa, offensive lineman Frank Martin II and wide receivers Velus Jones Jr., Trevon Sidney and Tyler Vaughns.
Current USC recruit Velus Jones is a prime example of players who are verbally committed but retract their commitments due to a change of heart. Originally, the four-star wideout stated his intent to be a Trojan last spring, then retracted and committed to the University of Oklahoma before finally stating on Twitter his final commitment to USC.
Throwing a further wrench into USC’s recruiting in 2016 could be Clay Helton’s newly-created coaching staff featuring Clancy Pendergast (defensive coordinator), Tyson Helton (quarterbacks and passing game coordinator), John Baxter (special teams coordinator/tight ends), Johnny Nansen (linebackers), Ronnie Bradford (secondary), Neil Callaway (offensive line), Tee Martin (offensive coordinator/wide receivers), Tommie Robinson (running backs) and Keneche Udeze (defensive line).
ESPN columnist Greg Katz wrote in his latest blog post about the advantages and disadvantages associated with Helton’s latest hirings.
“To put it bluntly, the new faces on Helton’s staff have been given very little time to do what normally takes a high school lifetime to make recruiting inroads,” Katz wrote. “The good news, however, is that some of the holdovers from Helton’s staff are considered outstanding recruiters.”
With eight four-star recruits already committed, the Trojans’ 2016 recruiting class is ranked 34th by Rivals.com and is tied for seventh with nine ESPN Top 300 recruits committed.
In terms of recruits who have interest in joining USC this fall, the Trojans have a multitude of top athletes interested, including some who have committed via social media but are not officially signed until Wednesday.
On Monday, blue chip kicker Michael Brown announced his commitment to USC via Twitter despite reports that another blue chip kicker, Quinn Nordin, decommitted from Penn State and visited USC’s campus this past weekend.
Considering Alex Wood completed just 13 of his 17 field goal attempts in 2015, including 9-for-12 from inside 40 yards, a new place kicker could be exactly what the Trojans need.
Unfortunately for the Trojans, despite No. 1 overall recruit Rashan Gary visiting and expressing potential interest in becoming a Trojan, Gary has whittled his college list down to the Michigan Wolverines and the College Football Playoff Runner-Up Clemson Tigers.
As for the other potential recruits who have yet to commit or sign letters of intent, the Trojans are in the running for multiple top-tier prospects.
Five-star Long Beach Poly cornerback Jack Jones. Jones has received offers from many top schools, but is considering Arizona, Arizona State, Alabama, Texas A&M and USC. The Los Angeles Times reported that USC was among Jones’ final three schools along with Texas A&M and Alabama.
Of the five players that visited USC this past weekend, the most exciting is tight end Devin Asiasi who is a big, physical tight end who adds another level of versatility to the Trojans’ offense.
In review, USC’s top recruits are defensive linemen Jonathan Kongbo III from Arizona Western; Connor Murphy from Brophy Preparatory in Phoenix, AZ; Maxs Tupai from Murray, Utah; Boss Tagaloa from Concord De La Salle in Concord, California; defensive back Jamel Cook from Miami Central, Florida; and tight end Devin Asiasi from De La Salle.
In response to whether or not USC will have recruits to fill up the final seven scholarship spots, Los Angeles Times writer Lindsey Thiry wrote, “It seems unlikely, unless there are a few players who have been told by coaches that they can commit if there is room available at the end of signing day. USC is in good position for Long Beach Poly defensive back Jack Jones, but other than Jones, it seems to be anyone’s guess who will sign.”
Even though USC’s recruiting class is not as strong as it was in 2015, there are still several potentially valuable recruits in the 2016 class. The Trojans have solidified their offense for years to come with five receivers, a tight end, two offensive linemen and a dual threat quarterback in Matt Fink.
And while USC may have lost the Rashan Gary sweepstakes, the Trojans could be adding 20 potentially game-changing athletes ready to bring a national championship back to Los Angeles.

Junior shooting guard Julian Jacobs was named to the top ten finalists list for the Jerry West Shooting Guard of the Year Award. The watch list, selected by the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame, narrows down the competition for the final award, which will be announced on April 8.
Named after Hall of Famer and 1959 NCAA Final Four Most Outstanding Player Jerry West, the award recognizes the top shooting guards in Division I men’s college basketball. This is only the second year that the award has been given out by the Naismith Hall of Fame. Last year, it was given to former Ohio State University guard D’Angelo Russell.
Averaging 12.1 points, 5.9 assists and 5.2 rebounds, Jacobs has played an integral part in leading the Trojans to a 17-5 record. This season has been the best start since 1991. Jacobs isn’t just a scoring leader for the USC offense — he’s also an offensive leader throughout the entirety of the Pac-12. He leads the division in assists per game and ranks sixth in steals per game, with an average of 1.5.
His dynamic energy on the offense has garnered 22 dunks this season, providing an explosiveness that the Trojans need in order to stay competitive throughout the rest of their season. Jacobs will be key in solidifying an already strong season for the Trojans.
This honor ranks Jacobs right alongside national superstars from powerhouse programs, such as Buddy Hield from the University of Oklahoma and Grayson Allen from Duke University. The pair will provide stiff competition. Hield has averaged 26.2 points per game while leading his Oklahoma squad to take the number one spot and put up a staggering 46 points and seven assists in the team’s triple-overtime loss to the University of Kansas. Allen, meanwhile, averages 20.3 points and 3.7 assists despite a disappointing season for the recently unranked Blue Devils.
The competition will be narrowed down to five finalists in March before the final announcement at the ESPN College Basketball Awards Show in April. The show is also in its second year and will take place at the Nokia Theater, where the Hall of Fame will also present the Bob Cousy Point Guard of the Year Award, the Julius Erving Small Forward of the Year Award and the Karl Malone Power Forward of the Year Award.

Does everyone at USC really hate UCLA? Possibly, but probably not — and here’s why: I don’t hate UCLA.
The band tells us we hate UCLA nearly every time they play. But what is the real meaning behind this rivalry, or rather, why does every incoming freshman play along so willingly, professing their hatred for UCLA at every chance they get?
I, too, was one of these freshmen. I purchased a FUCLA shirt during the 2014 football season  to wear to the Rose Bowl. Luckily for me, I was too embarrassed to wear it before the game even started, so I didn’t have to wear it later that night after we had suffered the loss.
I understand that UCLA is right across town from us and the competition is fierce, but why the hatred?
I grew up an unabashed UCLA fan because of their basketball team, being a young basketball player myself. My dad and I would spend countless hours watching the games, discussing the players and feeling crushed when, in 2006 and 2007, Florida ended our bid for a national title.
My grandma earned her Ph.D. in education from UCLA and consequently, rooting for the Bruins became a familial ritual symbolic of a great achievement for one of our own.
When college applications rolled around, UCLA was an obvious pick for me, and I didn’t even consider applying to USC until I toured the campus with my mom on the same day. I fell in love with USC and of course the rest is history: I picked USC the moment I got accepted I became a Trojan for life, and I immediately resented every trace of powder blue and every note of the eight-clap.
Not so fast.
Of course I love USC, but I don’t despise UCLA.
My allegiances lie without a doubt with the Cardinal and Gold. How could they not? I love kicking the flag poles before a football game, singing along to a good ole DJ Malski song at the basketball game and singing along to the Fight Song and Tusk when the band plays. I am a Trojan through and through.
In light of the upcoming rivalry game though, I know that the anti-Bruin sentiment will be flowing among my fellow classmates, and I will be cheering for our basketball team alongside the rowdiest and loudest of the bunch.
This is what makes the rivalry so much fun for me. While some students on campus curse the Bruins and desecrate their mascot, I hope they don’t really mean it. Of course I love being at Conquest to witness the burning of the bear, and “Tusk” is my favorite song that the band plays, but it’s all just fun and games.
The real competition will be between each sports team and as much as we’d like to think that we do, there really isn’t any impact the student body has on the outcome of the game — being that the Galen Center is nowhere near the hostile environment of Allen Fieldhouse or Cameron Stadium.
When it comes down to USC and UCLA, ‘SC is going to be my pick every time, but when UCLA is taking on someone else, am I allowed to call myself a closet UCLA fan?
Sure, it could lead to questions regarding loyalty, pride or school spirit, but I am confident in myself and my school in all of those departments, and I have nothing to say to those who doubt that I can be dedicated to USC while still harboring a soft spot for UCLA.
My friends always criticize the fact that I like baby blue uniforms, think Joe Bruin is cute or know the eight-clap, but I can’t help it; it’s part of my heritage.
So to any UCLA sympathizer out there, I hope you know that you aren’t alone. That doesn’t mean I’m sitting around hoping that a recruit picks Westwood over Downtown, but I’m hoping that I don’t have to choose between being considered a loyal Trojan or having to prove my loyalty by wearing disrespectful clothing and shouting profanities at every UCLA fan that I encounter; let’s face it: the quality of our rival improves ourselves.
By continually competing with UCLA in academics, sports and social life, we raise the bar for ourselves as well. Going head-to-head with one of the top universities in the country only validates our claims of being at the top as well.
That’s why this rivalry is special to me and hopefully to everyone on either side of the pick. No matter what team you are pulling for or what mascot graces your t-shirts, greatness presides in every match, meeting, game and competition that our schools engage in.
With all of that said, rest in confidence knowing that all my heart will be cheering for our Trojans Thursday night when they clash with the Bruins at the Galen Center, and I’ll be crushed if we don’t win. But know that the next round of the rivalry is just around the corner. There is always another chance for us to get back at the big bad Bruins, but I don’t think a little powder blue ever hurt anybody.

A true USC fan hates fucla, period.  Some only wear their fucla shirts after winning a game.  Those are called bandwagon fans.  Others will proudly wear their fucla shirt, win or lose.  If you don’t understand this, it’s because you are not a true fan.
I don’t hate Ucla. I met a lot of good people from there. 
When it comes to football, people in LA, and CA for that matter, know who’s who; even those out of state. When it comes to academics their reputation, unfortunately for us Trojans, upstages SC’s because of their legacy in research. But I’m like whatevers. I didn’t become a Heisman winner or NFL star like Reggie Bush; I’m not some top researcher from Ucla…so none of these things benefit me, and I cannot vicariously live through either.
What I don’t like about Ucla is how over the top their liberal stance is; it’s on parity with Cal Berkeley’s. SC is apolitical, but alas is becoming more liberal. I like moderation in all things, so I’m on the fence about a lot of issues. And with that said, I don’t 100% hate Ucla, but I’d say 50% :)
Obviously you don’t have the years behind you of the terrible fans jealous nature from that school in Westwood. Athletically us old time alums and supporters want the ‘ruins to lose in every sport. Most likely you being a female with only your 2nd year at USC
after rooting for those clowns have no idea what the rivalry really means. This article has no business being in the Daily Trojan.
Your half-hearted support is not needed by any real Trojan. Fight Off, please.

When you think of prestigious athletic programs at USC, you don’t often think of rugby.
Only a few people know that the rugby team rivals football in terms of longevity. Founded in 1887, rugby was even a varsity sport before football took over.
Nowadays, rugby is a club sport that plays in the Southern California Gold Coast Conference, and is comprised of 64 players who are dedicated to an underappreciated — if not forgotten –— sport on campus.
Jonathan So, a senior and president of the team, is mindful of the history of rugby at USC.
“The USC rugby tradition has been carried on all these years,” So said. “It feels really rewarding to be part of something that’s so old and has been around for so long.”
At first glance, rugby seems like a disorganized, chaotic sport, with the ball continuously moving, bodies flying all over the place and scrums developing on every play.
But beneath the surface, it is a sport that requires extreme versatility and demands respect between opponents. Unlike football, rugby players stay on the field for both offense and defense, increasing responsibility. And the continuous action is more tiring on the body and more harmonious to watch than football, where play is stopped seemingly every few seconds.
“There’s a huge focus on teamwork,” So said. “I know that sounds vague, but there’s honestly a spot on the field for everyone. The positions are so diverse, and it’s definitely a ‘gentleman’s sport.’”
That’s the underlying theme of rugby, which they say is a “hooligan’s game played by gentlemen” (as opposed to soccer, a “gentleman’s game played by hooligans”). Players may be trying to tackle each other in the open field without much protection, but opponents have a tremendous amount of respect for each other.
Junior Corbin Bennett, the captain of the team, believes this is what sets rugby apart from other sports.
“Rugby has camaraderie to it, where it’s more of a brotherhood,” Bennett said. “There’s this respect to it that you can’t describe or find a quote for unless you actually experience it yourself. That’s something so beautiful about the game, and it’s overlooked among other sports.”
However, it is hard to learn to appreciate a sport if you can’t see it, which is the predicament that USC students face with rugby. The team is not allowed to play its home matches on campus, meaning it is relegated to borrowing local high school fields. This prevents them from drawing much of the student population who have been drawn in by a rugby match held on campus.
“We wish we could have a wider fan base, and that’s something we’re working toward,” So said. “But it’s something that’s also very difficult, because we don’t necessarily have the resources to draw that fan base.”
The team used to play at McAlister Field —  also home to women’s soccer and women’s lacrosse — but was banned after they left the field conditions “damaged and unplayable” following a match, according to a statement from USC Athletics. They practice at Cromwell Field but are unable to hold matches because the field is not regulation size.
“The Athletic Department and Recreation Sports Department decided to eliminate rugby games on McAlister Field in order to protect the field’s condition and playability for its many other users,” the statement concluded.
For the team, though, this feels less like a need to protect field condition and more of an unfair restriction on the oldest club sport on campus.
“[The administration was] throwing [its] weight around,” So said. “It’s a little ridiculous, because the women’s rugby team is allowed to practice there, and every other club sport can use that field, but it’s specifically men’s rugby they’re complaining about. For that reason, we can’t have home games. When you can’t have games at home, it’s hard to bring a fan base out.”
So said that while they have an immediate network of fans that support them and membership on the team has doubled since he was a freshman, the administration is holding them back from taking bigger steps to increase the popularity of rugby around USC. They don’t have the money for a scrum machine, a common and necessary piece of equipment in the sport. Without a place to work out, they wake up at 6 a.m. to trek to Lyon Center to avoid crowds.
“Being the largest and oldest club sport in a private school, it’s a little ridiculous that Athletics is brushing us aside while all these programs [in other schools] grow around us,” So said.
But the dedication and commitment remains strong, and the camaraderie even more apparent. As practice wrapped up one Wednesday last month, the players locked arms in a circle while their coach gave a pep talk. Then, they launched into a chant -— the “USC Rugby War Cry” — a loud, bellowing series of yelps in perfect harmony.
“Here we are, ha, here we are, ha, SC, SC, ra ra ra, T-R-O-J-A-N-S, Trojans,” the chant ends.
“The bond that rugby brings is something that is so unique about the game,” Bennett said. “It doesn’t matter your height, weight or size; somebody is going to have your back even if you just met them. It’s unlike any other sport.”
It is a sport that is slowly growing on the world stage. The Rugby World Cup is the third largest sporting event in the world. Rugby sevens, a variation of rugby, will be an Olympic sport for the first time in 2016. The Professional Rugby Organization is launching North America’s first professional rugby league that will begin play in April of this year.
Yet, despite the progress around them, the rugby team at USC feels stuck in the mud.
“Our players are putting in the effort, but we really need the school to step up and provide us with more resources so that we can grow as the sport grows as well,” So said. “We don’t want to be left behind.”
 
 
 
 
Absolutely ridiculous how Men’s Rugby is banned from McAllister while sports like lacrosse and soccer also rip the field. Not to mention the fraternities and sororities that use the field and trash it afterwards.

“Til it happens to you, you won’t know, it won’t be real / No it won’t be real, won’t know how I feel,” croons the impassioned voice of Lady Gaga, expressing the emotional turmoil of being raped at 19 years old in the documentary The Hunting Ground.
While some may never know how it feels to be a victim of sexual assault, the controversial documentary The Hunting Ground has granted a voice to victims silenced by their college institutions and helped catapult the issue of on-campus rape into the spotlight.
In this jarring exposé, rape survivors from across the country tell audiences of their harrowing experiences with sexual assault, their university’s attempt to undermine and suppress their claims and these survivors’ fight for justice. The Hunting Ground has received praise from The New York Times for this “work of cine-activism.” However, the film has also faced opposition, with accusations that the film presents a misleading picture.
USC happens to have a few cameos in this illustrious documentary. In a couple of scenes, the Row serves as the backdrop to the portion of the film that addresses the problems with sexual assaults at greek fraternities. The film also features a few of USC fraternity houses, on-street interviews with girls going out on the Row and some quick snippets from actual frat parties. Additionally, some of the rape survivors speaking out about their wrenching experiences are currently USC students.
However, on Feb. 2, the USC School of Cinematic Arts hosted a screening of the documentary followed by a Q&A with producer Amy Ziering through their Outside the Box [Office] program. Outside the Box [Office] is an ongoing film festival, showcasing upcoming international, documentary and independent films, that is free of charge and open to the public. The Hunting Ground is just one of many screenings the group is hosting this year that deal with contemporary issues.
With a less than flattering depiction of the institution, this screening provides a refreshing dose of transparency with issues of sexual assault on campus. Despite all the reasons the University had to oppose the screening of The Hunting Ground, including USC’s own Title IX investigation, university officials were actually supportive in making this event happen.
“USC as an institution has never threatened any kind of censorship or backlash against content,” said Alessandro Ago, SCA’s director of programming and special projects and head of Outside the Box [Office]. “I screen films that might elicit a bit of controversy. The beauty of screening these works in an academic context is that we’re in a forum that students should feel open to engage in controversial topics.”
The screening of this particular documentary will bring the nation’s and the University’s issues with on-campus rape to the forefront. Eli Meyer, a senior majoring in cinematic arts and instrumental in planning this event, hopes to make the screening of The Hunting Ground an annual event and maybe even try to integrate it into greek life at USC. Meyer realizes the potential in the film raising awareness and inciting more discourse on campus of this hypersensitive topic.
“USC, being one of the most desired and well-known American universities, has a very unique ability to create change and influence the entire nation,” Meyer said. “I hope that this screening will prompt the student body to really start to understand how big of a problem sexual assault on campus is and use their knowledge to spread the word as far and wide as possible.”
At the end of the film, the lyrics of Lady Gaga’s emotional rendition of “Til It Happens To You” speaks volumes about the importance of addressing sexual assaults on campus. “Tell me how the hell could you talk, how could you talk? / Cause until you walk where I walk, this is no joke,” sings Lady Gaga. The Hunting Ground has created a stage for numerous silenced sexual assault victims to come forward and do just that.

Elton John is back and better than ever. For the 33rd time, the legend himself will be releasing a new studio album, Wonderful Crazy Night. The album is set to be released this Friday and the anticipation has been building since his last solo album, 2013’s The Diving Board.
The album features 10 tracks, while a deluxe version is available with an additional two tracks. If that doesn’t do the trick, there is also a “super deluxe” version featuring four more tracks, for a total of 14, as well as a 20-page book to accompany photographs and a set of lyrics.
With a rock inspiration and the producing talents of T Bone Burnett, John has it going on. Alongside longtime songwriter, lyricist and partner-in-crime, Bernie Taupin, who serves as a huge component to the foundation of the album, John’s voice perfectly parallels the instrumentals. To sum up the album, John described it as if it were “like Southern rock-‘n’-roll -— Little Feat and Canned Heat.” Many tracks feature that Southern rock sound with a few hints of blues throughout, making listeners feel as if they were taking a stroll down Beale Street in Memphis, Tennessee, the hometown of this mixture of Southern rock and blues. John is also makes a breakthrough with Wonderful Crazy Night and really delves into his older sounds, with some sounding similar to that of “Philadelphia Freedom” and “Crocodile Rock.”
The album primarily focuses on the central theme of love, a topic John never fails at vocalizing. Singles like “Wonderful Crazy Night” and “Looking Up” captivate his soul and are definitely a signature to his unforgettable sound. John features a versatility in his voice that’s rough yet enamoring, grasping and entrancing listeners. He successfully portrays this in one of four singles, “In The Name Of You,” consisting of a steady yet upbeat tempo and a stellar electric guitar riff.
John was said to have asked Taupin for a more upbeat sound, explaining that he was “not very good at writing up-tempo songs,” but wanted “the lyrics to be joyous,” avoiding any sadness in this record. With four singles already released, John has already done a good job of vocalizing his happiness -— that’ll hopefully be constant throughout the rest of the album.
It’s safe to assume he’ll sound just as happy, successful and raw live with a North American tour spread through the country, having already started last month in Las Vegas and ending in Las Vegas in April. John’s reputation will only be heightened with the release of this album, and he will probably be releasing another 33 studio albums sometime in the future.
Correction: A previous version of this article stated that Elton John’s last album was 2006’s The Captain and the Kid. It was 2013’s The Diving Board. The article also stated that there are 16 tracks on the “super deluxe” version of Wonderful Crazy Night. There are 14. The article has also been updated to correct the spelling of songwriter Bernie Taupin’s surname. The Daily Trojan regrets the errors. 
The factual errors made this too painful to read, but I appreciate the basic sentiment
“Taupin” and not “Taubin”!!!
The tracks in the super-deluxe edition are 14 and not 16!
Elton’s last album was The Diving Board in 2013 and before that The Union in 2010…Best do some research beforehand in the future?
Not to mention it’s Taupin not Taubin

Cue thrilling action music. Cut to an intense helicopter flying over the most historic landmarks in Washington, D.C. — the Capitol Building, the White House and the Pentagon. Though Where to Invade Next doesn’t initially seem like a Michael Moore film, due to more comedy and patriotism then all of his previous movies combined, it most surely is. The Academy Award-winning documentary filmmaker behind movies such as Fahrenheit 9/11 and Bowling for Columbine, Moore once again delivers a thought-provoking film that not only questions the actions done by Americans on a daily basis but also offers effective solutions to those problems. Where to Invade Next takes the audience around the Caucasian world, through countries Moore “can mostly pronounce,” in an attempt to steal the successful practices of such countries for the United States. In his most nationalistic film to date, Moore aims not to tear America and its citizens down, but to build them up. The film is set to re-open on Feb. 12.
The movie commences dramatically with suspenseful music and fly-by helicopter shots typical of the next Michael Bay Transformers movie, but while automobiles transforming into Autobots may not be serious, Moore assures viewers that his mission is. Summoned by the Joint Chief of Staff, Moore is tasked, in an effort to avoid spending billions of dollars at war, with invading countries around the world in search of “the things we need from them and bring them back home to the United States.” Armed with nothing but his signature baseball cap and the American flag wrapped around him, Moore travels to the likes of Italy, France, Finland, Slovenia, Germany, among other countries.
Moore’s masterful storytelling abilities are on full display throughout the movie and can especially be seen in Italy, as he interrogates an Italian couple. While avoiding controversial interrogation techniques, such as waterboarding and sleep deprivation, Moore gets the truth out of the 30-something couple. Mandated by law, all Italians must receive at least four weeks paid vacation every year, but when government holidays are added into the equation, paid time off is closer to eight weeks a year. Policies of a minimum of five months maternity and paternity leave, two hour lunches and layaway vacation days — where if a worker doesn’t utilize his or her paid vacation days, he or she can save them for the future and still be paid — overwhelmed Moore. In an effort to ease past critiques of his liberal objectives, Moore consistently asked the couple demanding questions, even venturing to the floor of Ducati factories, the famous motorcycle brand, to interview the company’s CEOs about its practices. Paired with a union representative of the Ducati company, the CEOs agreed that two-hour lunches and paid vacations were good for business because their employees are happier and therefore more productive. Flabbergasted, Moore directly asked, “But don’t you want to make more money?” The CEOs turned to each other confused, one responding, “No, we’re satisfied with our lives.” Certain that policies such as these in Italy should be employed in the United States, Moore plants the American flag on the floor of the factory, as well as in the nice couple’s living room.
The film goes on to address countless controversial ideas such as primary school reform, reducing the cost of college tuition as well as reducing mass incarceration, the legality of drugs and police enforcement. As the film progresses, it is clear that Moore’s approach is to highlight the power of the people and the power of women specifically. Traveling to Tunisia, the only non-European (and Muslim) country in the film, to cite their 2011 revolution and then to Iceland where he learns that the only company to escape the country’s massive financial meltdown was one founded and run by women. As Moore discovers and uncovers these ideas, he recognizes that they weren’t founded in these countries but back at home in the United States, and that his mission wasn’t to steal these reforms, but to reclaim them.
While critics of Moore’s style and opinion will insist that if Moore is unhappy with the policies of the United States, he should move to one of these countries, he doesn’t shy away from the facts. From the beginning of the movie, it is clear that he is on a mission to “pick the flowers and not the weeds.” Whether or not one agrees with his politics or opinions, it is safe to say that Where to Invade Next is a thought-provoking film that focuses on what’s great about America and inspires people to take those first few steps toward change. After the credits, the video of the woman climbing the flagpole outside the South Carolina state house and tearing down the Confederate flag plays, reinforcing the message Moore had been encouraging all along: Americans can do better.

Pretty much since puberty onward, I have thought of myself as bisexual. In eighth grade, I remember tentatively telling my best friend that I thought I had a crush on the girl who sat next to me in band. I would stare at her all the time — she was gorgeous — and that was the only way to explain my obsession to myself.
I was 16 when I first declared my love to the female object of my affection. I played it off like it was easy, like I was totally comfortable with it, because she was suave, bold and sophisticated. She smoked and talked about art after school. She hung out with college students.
I got drunk for the first time trying to be cool for her, attempting to smoke a cigarette. We even kissed once, the first kiss I actually enjoyed. That was the night she met her boyfriend for the next three years.
There wasn’t really anyone after her who extended beyond a drunken kiss or a passing curiosity. I continued to identify as bisexual though, just inexperienced. But one night last year I was retelling my history of attraction in a bar. My friend mumbled something I couldn’t hear, then refused to tell me what she had said. When we were sober, I asked her again. She fiddled with her phone for a moment, then handed me a picture of a Word document.
We were seated next to each other
on a crowded bus at the time, and I could feel her watching me read. She said she liked me, that she hadn’t known that I was into girls before, that she hadn’t known she was either. At a loss with how to proceed, I told her I liked her too, but that I didn’t want to jeopardize our friendship by doing anything about it. That lasted for about a week.
We hooked up intermittently throughout the semester and never talked about it. She would try to start the conversation sometimes, commenting on her friends’ reception of the new romantic development in her life. I would change the subject.
I don’t know why acknowledging our discontinuous and fairly tame affair was so difficult for me. I even went as far as to question whether I was really even bisexual. My male partners seemed much more into women than I ever was. But I was genuinely attracted to her at times. So I brooded. I stopped responding to her
messages. I started finding reasons not to see her. I felt bad about it, but I couldn’t stop. Something just felt off.
Eventually, I broke down and went to dinner with her. She said she wasn’t used to not seeing me. In response, I perspired excessively and drank another glass of water. I couldn’t be present — she just reminded me of how shamefully absent I’d been, how I had taken advantage of her affection for me, how much of a hypocrite I was. I had been the one confidently touting my bisexuality, and now that she felt comfortable in hers, I suddenly felt insecure.
She asked me to hang out a few times after that, but I couldn’t make myself go. Finally, she sent me a message marveling at our history together, and I didn’t respond. She didn’t text me after that.
I still dread seeing her around, something I haven’t felt with former flames. I fled a party once because I thought she would be there. My friends
said I was being immature. I agreed but couldn’t stop myself from feeling this way. I usually pride myself on being friendly with old lovers, but for whatever reason, she’s a different story. She should hate me. I hate myself for being so awful to her, and I can’t see her because that would remind me of how awful I was to her.
I never explained any of this to her — I wanted to, I wanted to write her a long letter eloquently extricating myself from her affections, but I didn’t. It was easier to be busy, to let silence do the talking, because then I didn’t have to feel the immediate shame of having hurt her.
I never loved her, not even close, but she was sweet to me. She listened to me and asked thoughtful questions. She called me out on my bullsh-t. I want to credit her with that, even if that credit doesn’t amount to reciprocated affection. I’m not sorry I pulled away, I had to, but I am sorry for a lot of other things. I wasn’t as confident in my sexual orientation as I thought I was and more than anything, I’m sorry I took that out on you.

February is Black History Month. This means that out of the 366 days of this year, 29 of them will be dedicated to celebrating black excellence. By March, however, the narrative of black Americans will reset to criminalization, systemic racism and second-class citizenry.  In the remaining 337 days, black Americans will return to crying out “I can’t breathe” while suffocating under the grip of the U.S. criminal justice system — and at the same time shouting, “hands up, don’t shoot” and“pants up, don’t loot.” Yet despite the persistence of civil rights violations throughout history, many challenge the need and even the legitimacy of Black History Month out of a belief that the gesture is self-serving and obsolete; however, the assumption that BHM was designed for an earlier era and is now of no use is not only reductive but also extremely misguided. Regardless of what year it is, attributing the month of February to the history and veneration of black Americans despite racial inequality explains a critically important point — why “Black Lives Matter.”
Clueless actress and former Fox News contributor Stacey Dash, who is Bajan, black and Mexican, called for the elimination of BHM as well as Black Entertainment Television in a series of dangerous, overtly simplistic statements made to Fox and Friends on Jan. 20. She said: “Either we want to have segregation or integration. And if we don’t want segregation, then we need to get rid of channels like BET and the BET awards and the Image Awards, where you’re only awarded if you’re black. If it were the other way around, we would be up in arms. It’s a double standard.”
She continued to say that BET promoted segregation and lied to “American black people by telling them that the rest of America is racist” in a follow-up essay. To Dash, it is important to note that racial equality condemns both segregation and integration, as they are the foundations of institutionalized racism. Discrimination from government organizations, banks, courts of law and unequal access to quality education implicitly put black Americans at a disadvantage, rendering their ability to “integrate” nearly impossible. It is important to note that Dash’s use of the word “integrate” is a double-edged sword in that black Americans should be able to participate as themselves — as black Americans — in society, not abandon their racial identity to integrate into society.
In honor of BHM — and seeing that Black History is not taught from a black perspective but a predominantly white one — it is more than appropriate to use the history itself to explain how the past defines the racial injustices of today. There are two fundamental works conveniently left out of all levels of education: Slavery by Another Name and The New Jim Crow — the first, a documentation of the advent of industrial slavery in post-Civil War America and its criminalization of black people into second-class citizenry. At this time, the convict lease system relegated black Americans into forced laborers, imprisoned by the U.S. justice system as encouraged by states, local government, white farmers and corporations until World War II. The latter work traces the narrative of segregation and so-called integration well after the Civil Rights Movement, as seen with the mass incarceration of black Americans as a result of the disproportionate and skewed policing of the war on drugs. Since the 1980s, black Americans have been segregated through legalized discrimination and unfair prison sentences, which resulted in the inability to integrate in society after incarceration. The murders of Eric Garner, Michael Brown, Tamir Rice, Trayvon Martin, Sandra Bland and countless others as a result of unwarranted racial profiling and subsequent police brutality illustrate how black Americans are segregated from equal protection under law and are unable to integrate into society due to the color of their skin, which either criminalizes or commodifies them.
In light of the harsh realities of what it means to be black in America, U.S. history illustrates the need for the veneration, understanding and awareness of the other side of Black History. The month of February is important because it is a gesture of recognition and visibility to a group of Americans who are more often than not silenced, oppressed and altogether ignored. Above all else, it is ignorant to assume that racism only has a place in history as it is very much a part of today and the future. In spite of generations of structural violence and subsequent discrimination, black Americans prove that they are and always will be resilient — and the observation of BHM translates into solidarity against racism, acknowledging that “Black Lives Matter.”

Ok people. I. AM. NOT. RACIST. I have black friends. In my class I sit with 2 black students, 2 Hispanic, and one biracial (black/Asian). I like all of them. But I am not a fan of the Black Lives Matter movement, or basically society right now. Everyone finds racism in everything, like the Oscars. Now that there’s no black nominees, the Academy is all of the sudden racist. Remember Gone With the Wind? Yeah, maybe your grandma does from over half a century ago. A black woman won the award for best supporting actress. Remember Jamie Foxx in “Ray”? He won Best Actor. Remember that woman who won Best Supporting Actress in “12 Years a Slave”?, about the hardships of black lives in the slavery era? AND that movie one Best Picture. And it wasn’t that long ago, the 2013 Academy Awards. You can not tell me that the Academy has suddenly turned racist. I’m calling bullshit on that one. Look, black lives matter. They do. Look at society now. This generation is so accepting of race. At my high school (I’m not 17), if you’re racist, people will kick your ass. Black people have the same rights as the rest of us. They have it much harder though because they are still recovering from the forced poverty of the last century. It’s a chain reaction. And it is harder for them to get jobs because there is that small portion of people who are still racist. The only problem is . . . what can we do? Nothing really. That person is still racist. We can’t stop racism. There is always that small portion of people who are biased. Please can someone tell me the point of BLM, because I can’t figure out the point. What have they truly accomplished?
I’d like to preface my comments by mentioning I am NOT a person who embraces the ignorant, people dividing Black vs White or White vs Black game a significant number of my American neighbors wish to embrace. I’m a person who grew up in the sixties embracing the values of peace, love and unity espoused by many of my American neighbors of all flavors during that period of American history.
I recognize and appreciate the issues of inequality raised by members and supporters of the Black Lives Matter movement.
I realize there are inequalities that still need to be addressed for us to continue evolving toward becoming a more peaceful, emotionally healthy nation. I understand the pain, anger, frustrations and disappointment experienced by human beings who feel as though they are being cheated, oppressed, or not treated with the same respect all peaceful Americans are entitled to.
My life experiences also force me to realize there is a significant population of immature American teen girls and adult women my experiences tell me are responsible for impeding a substantial population of peaceful, caring, loving Americans from finding internal peace, and enjoying the respect all peaceful Americans deserve.
Frankly, I too experience pain, anger, frustration and disappointment caused by an American system and society that permits and seemingly encourages the human oppression, abuse and/or neglect of our Nation’s most precious and valuable resource, our children.
I am disappointed and frustrated by a significant population of immature moms like Baltimore mom and grandmother Toya Graham who I believe had no morally or ‘legally’ acceptable right to introduce SIX children to a life of hardships and struggles while depending on her responsible neighbors to feed, clothe and house her SIX children. One of whom was observed joining other depressed teens in attempting to cause grave bodily harm or death to police officers charged with protecting peaceful people from angry, depressed teens like her son Michael and many of his depressed classmates.
I am deeply troubled by moms much like Tavis Smiley’s mom,  who as a teen irresponsibly began building a family of ten children she introduced to a life of childhood oppression, pain, hardship and struggles. In May of 2015 Tavis revealed to a national and worldwide audience his nine brothers and sisters continue struggling from the affects of Poverty, aka Childhood Trauma and Abuse.
No one forced Toya Graham or Tavis Smiley’s mom to irresponsibly introduce sixteen human lives to a life of pain and struggle. 
Ms. Graham and Mrs. Smiley are much like countless numbers of depressed, immature teen moms across our nation who made a conscious decision to introduce their children to a life of emotional pain and turmoil causing them to experience life scarring Childhood Trauma that Grammy winner and victim of Childhood Abuse and Neglect Kendrick Lamar laments his “living wild,” Violent Felon embracing mom and dad caused him, his three siblings and numerous cousins to experience…instead of experiencing a fairly happy American kid childhood with Safe Streets to travel and play on that all young kids have a right enjoy.
I am sad, angry, frustrated and disappointed that a majority of my American neighbors choose to ignore the child oppression, abuse and neglect many immature, irresponsible moms like Ms. Graham and Mrs. Smiley cause their/society’s children to experience during a critical period of their human development.
Frankly, I believe these mom should be held criminally liable for  receiving public funds to support their children, and then failing to place the emotional well being of their children above all else, often resulting with kids like Freddie Gray maturing into a depressed teen and adult who causes harm to himself and his struggling or peaceful neighbors.
Sadly, far too many children raised by criminally negligent moms often develop into depressed, angry, frustrated, unpredictable, sometime suicidal *(NY Times May 18, 2015 – Rise in Suicide by Black Children Surprises Researchers)* teens and adults causing emotional and physical harm to their peaceful neighbors, resulting with the police becoming involved.
Sadly, regularly dealing with depressed, emotionally disturbed teens and adults much like Kendrick, Tupac Shakur, Freddie Gray and Michael Singleton took a toll on my emotional well being that resulted with me abandoning a Brooklyn community after spending twelve years of my life as a cop trying to protect peaceful people from Violent Felons who raised depressed kids like Kendrick Lamar, an emotionally damaged man who publicly speaks about his torment dealing with childhood and adult depression, as well as experiencing suicidal thoughts.
Yes, some police officers need to do a better job of remaining professional, adhering to their training, keeping cool, not allowing the human suffering and oppression of children and teens many police officers witness on a daily basis to erode their humanity or basic human respect for others.
Just as some single and married moms need to do a better job of parenting by raising, nurturing, socializing and supervising infants, toddlers and children who mature into fairly happy, responsible teens and adults respecting their peaceful neighbors and the authority figures responsible for maintaining peace in our neighborhoods.
I’m sorry to pick on moms, though since ancient times they are the primary caregivers we look to keep us safe, cared for and loved right from our start.

Police arrested eight immigrants-rights activists in downtown Los Angeles last Tuesday. The demonstration peaked in the late morning, as an estimated 300 protesters blocked an intersection near the Edward R. Roybal Federal Building. Several of the hundreds of protesters present laid their bodies down on the asphalt, hands clasped together, while others formed a large circle around the recumbent demonstrators. The activists, amid the various chants, had one resounding demand: an end to Immigration and Customs Enforcement raids detaining Central American immigrants.
ICE raids began across the nation on Jan. 2 with the detention of 121 people from Central America living in Texas, Georgia and North Carolina. The 121 detained Central American women and children comprise a fraction of the thousands who have fled Honduras, El Salvador and Guatemala — the Northern Triangle — in search of refuge from rampant gang violence — specifically kidnapping, rape and murder. The Obama administration’s decision to authorize these raids comes on the heels of Congress’ failure to pass immigration reform and the President’s subsequent executive orders on immigration.
In response to the outcry, like that of the 300 protesters in downtown Los Angeles, public officials, notably Department of Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson, have defiantly defended the recent ICE raids.
“As I have said repeatedly, our borders are not open to illegal migration; if you come here illegally, we will send you back consistent with our laws and values,” Johnson said in a statement Jan. 4.
However, the Obama administration and officials like Johnson have failed to dutifully recognize that the wave of thousands of Central Americans into the United States since 2014 is not merely an immigration issue. Indeed, the nation is in the midst of not only an unmitigated refugee crisis but also, more broadly, an international crisis of human rights, inconsistent with the laws and values the nation purports to uphold.
The Central American migrants who have escaped the Northern Triangle, which contains the most homicidal countries in the region, are not “illegal” as Johnson presumptively suggests; rather, the men, women and children — both accompanied and unaccompanied — who make the often-dangerous, precarious journey to the States are refugees with asylum claims that deserve lawful consideration. The International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the Torture Convention — two instruments of international human rights law to which the United States is a party — clearly affirm the principle of non-refoulement, which states that a person likely to experience “cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment” only if they are a danger to the nation or host country.
Further, the Southern Poverty Law Center reports in an investigation of the Atlanta ICE raids that federal officials were “needlessly aggressive” and committed “potentially unconstitutional” acts while detaining Central American women and children. The Atlanta raids appear to have been executed without warrants and without the voluntary and lawful consent necessary for officials to enter immigrants’ homes. ICE agents, in addition, denied women access to lawyers and forced them to sign legal documents they did not understand.
If the United States supports and protects human rights as it claims, then the Department of Homeland Security must end the ICE raids immediately. In the short term, the federal government should also grant Temporary Protected Status for individuals living in the U.S., close all family detention centers and ensure due process and other constitutional protections for every immigrant. Moreover, the federal government must ultimately resolve to reform its asylum system — a broken process that presents a number of insurmountable hurdles for the thousands seeking refuge.
As the 2016 presidential election approaches, one should consider the candidates’ positions on immigration reform. The Obama administration’s recent response to Central American migrants has disappointed many human rights advocates. The upcoming election will be an opportunity to absolve the nation of its sustained, unlawful treatment of asylum-seekers. USC students passionate about issues of human rights should inquire about any of the several organizations on campus, like United Nations Association USC and USC Amnesty International, which are committed to bringing awareness to injustice. In the face of political gridlock, student activism remains a powerful force in the effort to dismantle systemic injustice.
Only 70 out of the 121 there were not given asylum through their legal proceedings were actually deported.  This is out of the thousands who arrived at our border.
It has been proven that these continuing “surges” are not fleeing any uptick of crime, violence,  gang activity.  They were promised “permisos” from their clergy and media.  Due to Obama’s lax immigration policy, they believe this to be true.  Not mentioned that 70-90% of those released on “bond” or “security” bracelets do not show up for their legal proceedings.  They just “disappear” waiting “in the shadows” for the next mass amnesty.
What were the charges for the arrests? Did the demonstrators break any laws?

The USC student body elected the first all-female presidential ticket in Pac-12 history last year. The historic election also marked the first female president at USC since 2006. However, Undergraduate Student Government elections set to take place in early February offer no female presidential candidates. It is fitting, then, that in a year where once again no woman has chosen to seek the office of president or vice president, a study  by reported that female professors are more likely to receive unfavorable course evaluations. More specifically, the researchers concluded that course evaluations more often reflect students’ gender biases than they do the effectiveness of the professor. Students systematically favoring male professors has far-reaching, negative implications for women in all varieties of leadership positions, including student government.
Undergraduate elections and course evaluations may at first seem unrelated. Upon closer examination, however, both realities clearly and depressingly illustrate one way in which discrimination is perpetuated by the student body itself. In 2016, students still do not see women as leaders — at least, not in the same way as they see men. And judging by this year’s slate of presidential candidates, women on campus do not often enough see themselves as leaders.
This does not mean that students hate their female professors. In fact, most students have probably had a female professor whom they’ve loved. Nevertheless, instead of getting defensive about the results of the Sciences Po study, students must seriously examine the ways in which they view women in positions of power — especially when attending a school in which it is rare for women to run for the highest elected offices.
It is also important to note that the results of the study did not show that male students were more likely to be biased against female teachers. In fact, the study found that women in the United States exhibited more gender bias overall. Students of all genders have been socialized in a society that preferences male leadership, values male domination and dismisses female “bossiness.” It is not too surprising, then, that course evaluations seem to measure internalized sexism rather than a teacher performance.
Colleges across the nation, from Claremont to Yale, are on the brink of serious transformation, and professors cannot be left out of the important conversations. While it is comforting to look at discrimination and point to a single source, the reality is much more complicated. Let’s face it — the problems USC faces are more deep-rooted than administrative policies and cannot be fixed solely by appointing deans of diversity or re-implementing a diversity requirement. Of course, the importance of holding the administration accountable for creating a “culture of care” cannot be overstated. But students must also seriously examine the ways in which they themselves are perpetuating harmful and discriminatory practices. Consciousness-raising and deeply examining power relations must be part of the solution if students want to create a community that meets the needs of all.
It’s only February and the semester is far from over. So, there are still a few months before the emails begging students to fill out course evaluations are sent out. During these few months, the student body should begin exploring the ways in which they interact with their professors. This is not an easy process. Sexism is often deeply buried — surely, students do not consciously change their ratings based on a professor’s gender. However, if students critically examine how they view their professors and challenge any preconceived notions about women in power, perhaps they can also change the very landscape of leadership on campus and beyond.

This weekend, A-list celebrities such as Rachel McAdams and Naomi Watts dressed to impress at the Screen Actors Guild Awards held at the Shrine Auditorium Jan. 30. Starlets strutted effortlessly down the carpet sporting long, elegant trains of silk charmeuse, glittering sequins and intricate bead work. They also sported lavish jewelry made with the most precious gems and high heels that made their legs look miles long … This is what red carpet dreams are made of.
Many of the celebrities in attendance of the SAG Awards nailed their evening looks as veterans of the red carpet. However, red carpet expertise only comes from years of practice, and many of them have come a long way. Here are some side-by-sides of celebrities’ flawless formal ensembles from the SAG Awards and blunders on their red carpet debuts.

Naomi Watts rocked the SAG Awards red carpet looking classy and chic in this blue, flower-embellished Burberry number. This is a tremendous leap from her combination of a pastel yellow ruched tank top and a plain black midi skirt during her red carpet debut back in 2000.
