Last month, President Donald Trump and his administration announced that they would consider repealing the Obama-era Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program. The threat alone of rescinding this program, which currently allows undocumented people who were raised in this country to go to school, work and live in this country legally, was enough to yield massive liberal reaction on social media and at USC, a questionable initiative to help undocumented students led by the undocumented student and ally group IDEAS.
The resource center will open this month for a limited time on the fourth floor of Kaprielian Hall, and will hold office hours with Vanessa Gomez-Brake, the provost-appointed point of contact for immigration issues. The goal of the resource center is to give undocumented students complete access to all information and resources that the University offers to help them stay in school. Professor George Sanchez from the American Studies department justified the need for the center by citing how almost “every other campus in California has one.” 
“Other universities have moved much more quickly,” he said.“We just feel like this University moves way too slowly.”
The necessity of the “pop-up” resource center for undocumented students as DACA seems safe for the time being is one question, but arguably the bigger question at hand is whether the University has any right to openly defy federal law as an institution that receives federal funding. USC is right to be cautious and mindful in deciding whether to move forward and take action potentially in defiance of federal law. 
As tempting as it may be to simplify this situation into a binary of whether the University is helping or failing its students, this is a deeply incomplete portrayal. In reality, the validity of a campus undocumented student resource center and USC supporting initiatives that contradict federal law — or may contradict federal law in the future if DACA and the Development, Relief and Education for Alien Minors Act are rescinded later on — is a question of competing political goods, loyalties and moralities.

There is no denying that as an institution of higher learning, USC is bound not only to federal interests, but also to the cosmopolitan international network of universities, its greater tradition of inclusivity and its search for truth and intellectualism. There is the argument that this sacred traditional goal of expanding access to learning and being on the forefront of academic progress can only be advanced if the University takes a political stance as to protect diversity in classrooms. But the reality is that the best way for an institution of higher education to be loyal to its students is, frankly, to not be political.
When an institution like USC takes political stances over polarizing topics such as immigration reform, it is implicitly silencing ideas from the many intellectuals on its campus that disagree, and attacking that aforementioned goal of higher education, which is to foster diversity of ideas and protect intellectual debate. Furthermore, there is great risk in supporting initiatives and offering services and programs that defy or veer on defying federal law, while simultaneously relying on the federal government’s financial support. Loss of federal funding for scholarships, programs and opportunities for USC’s student body is a steep cost for self-righteousness and partisanship. 
None of this is to say that I do not personally support aid for undocumented students and fostering an inclusive and diverse environment at the University. This is not a question of my personal beliefs, but of the implications of universities taking political stances and defying the laws of the federal institutions that they rely on for survival. 
The fact that a number of universities, especially in California, have undocumented student resource centers reveals that one at USC will not exactly be controversial, and if we drew the ire of the federal government, we would be one university among many. In the same vein, USC offers student services for a number of identity groups, and also without controversy. But as for the University moving “way too slowly,” in the words of Professor Sanchez, I agree that USC may be moving slowly. However, I disagree that this is a bad thing. There is much at stake in these circumstances, and that’s why they demand thoughtfulness and vigilance.

I rescinded a recent gift because I refuse to allow or enable any of my donations to support illegal aliens before Foster kids, poor kids who come from single parent homes, first generation American kids who need money, and other more deserving youth.  DACA is a ZERO priority, IMO, because it places foreign interests above Americans.  Nikias, of course, being a naturalized citizen, does not distinguish between Americans and foreigners when dispensing scholarship monies; most Americans, however, do and refuse to pander to the globalist idiocy du jour.
USC is a private university. It has good finances and is generous, but can provide student aid only to a point. Much of USC’s revenue goes to student aid – fellowships, scholarships, grants. In giving this money, many highly deserving students do not quite make the cut, because USC does not have unlimited money to give student aid to all who are meritorious.
OK. That said, do you believe USC should then give precious resources to illegal immigrants when highly qualified US citizen students are being passed over?
No.

In response to President Donald Trump’s announcement that his administration would consider rescinding the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, USC created an undocumented student resource center — a “pop-up DREAMer center” in Kaprielian Hall for a limited time. In doing so, the University joined scores of other universities that showed they were not afraid to step into the political fray in order to help their students. It was an important acknowledgement of the barriers that undocumented students face at the University and a crucial step forward. Following this momentum, the University should continue to expand resources for vulnerable student populations — undocumented students, first-generation students, low-income students, LGBT students and students of color. This includes reaffirming administrators’ commitment to providing robust cultural centers and scholarship funds which recognizes unique barriers that some students face.
The threat of a DACA repeal last month left undocumented students in deep uncertainty about their future. Now it’s time for the University to step in and inform students about what they can do to protect themselves, and I am proud that it has decided to do so.
It is shameful that some might denounce the University’s move to open an undocumented student resource center as overly political, or argue that it is inappropriately participating in a national debate on immigration. By providing students — all students — the resources they need, it is working toward the inclusion that a diverse student body necessitates. 
If that is considered political, then fine. The University’s commitment to diversity and its refusal to punish undocumented students could be considered political by some. But it should not allow the potential backlash to stop it from supporting its diverse student body. 
The political chaos of today requires this kind of moral courage. It requires typically neutral people and organizations — like universities — to protect students when its government will not. That is the right thing to do.
Jessie Chang | Daily Trojan
The Daily Trojan Editorial Board, of which I am a party, first wrote that the University needed an undocumented student resource center in late March. Today, this is truer than ever, and luckily, this resource will be provided to students in the near future. 
It is important for the University to remember the significance of institutional bravery in the face of crises affecting students. It has still not declared itself a sanctuary campus, unlike droves of other universities, and should be urged to reconsider in light of recent developments. It should not let the fear of being thrust into a political controversy prevent it from providing robust support to its students.
More than anything, it should listen. USC needs to remind itself that because it wanted a diverse student body, it has a responsibility to create an environment for all students to succeed. And so it needs to listen to the challenging demands of students — not just undocumented students, but differing student groups facing various barriers on campus.
This is the kind of leadership that USC should strive toward. The University is looking upon a new era — while attempting to put faculty scandals behind it, it has been hoping to, and succeeding in, raising its own profile over the past few years. The University’s trajectory in accomplishing this goal has been objectively dramatic.
But it needs to remember its students. This past week, it made a major move to recognize the needs of its most vulnerable. It should continue to do so because that is the Trojan spirit.

Brian Chin | Daily Trojan
After suffering their first loss in over a year, the Trojans now find themselves 4-1. With a long list of injuries and problems to address, the Trojans returned to the practice field to try and get back on track after their emotional loss in Pullman. But head coach Clay Helton talked down the doom and gloom.
“We’re in a great situation right now,” Helton said. “If you remember last year at this time we were 2-3. We’re 4-1 and we control our own destiny right now. It’s about us right now. It’s about us setting our standard for the month of October and November, where we have been really good the past few years.” 
As the Trojans get healthier and they get a chip on their shoulder, Helton and the team hope that they can still make their playoff dream a reality. 
A Lengthy Injury Report
Entering the game on Friday the Trojans were banged up, with several players not making the trip to Washington. USC returned to Los Angeles with even more injuries. Junior right tackle Chuma Edoga (ankle) and senior right guard Viane Talamaivao (shoulder) both missed practice and are questionable for Saturday. 
Freshman running back Stephen Carr, who has been one of USC’s biggest weapons in the run and passing game, injured his ankle on Friday. Helton said Carr is in a boot and is doubtful for Oregon State. In a freak incident during pregame warmups, redshirt junior wide receiver Jalen Green and sophomore linebacker Jordan Iosefa collided. Both players missed the game and are still in the concussion protocol. 
On the defensive side of the ball, junior linebacker Porter Gustin (toe/bicep), junior defensive lineman Rasheem Green (ankle, shoulder) and freshman defensive lineman Marlon Tuipulotu (back) both missed practice and are questionable. Defensive linemen Josh Fatu (senior) and Malik Dorton (redshirt junior) both sprained their knees and were limited on Tuesday. Freshman cornerback Greg Johnson injured his shoulder against Washington State and will be out for the season. 
Despite all the bad news, the Trojans do have a couple of guys that are close to returning to action. The wide receiver corp will hopefully get reinforcements on Saturday. Senior wide receiver Steven Mitchell (groin) is hoping to come back after two weeks out. He practiced on Tuesday and Helton said he expects him to return this week. Last week, redshirt junior Toa Lobendahn, the Trojans’ starting left tackle, didn’t even travel with the team due to a staph infection. Lobendahn returned to practice after staying in the hospital for four days receiving treatment. 
Scouting the Beavers
Oregon State will come into the Coliseum with a 1-4 record. Coming off a brutal stretch of their schedule where they faced Washington State and Washington, the Beavers have been outscored 94-30. While the Trojans come into the matchup on Saturday with injuries, the Beavers also have key players out. Starting junior quarterback Jake Luton was injured two weeks ago against Washington State, and senior Darell Garretson has been the next man up. In addition to a backup quarterback, the Beavers might be without their leading rusher, junior running back Ryan Nall. 
Despite the problems the Beavers are having on the offensive side of the ball, Helton remains cautious. While their loss to Washington may look bad on paper, the 42-7 beatdown was only 7-0 entering halftime. 
“Being a young coach, I grew up watching coach Anderson and how he runs things,” Helton said. “I’ve always had so much respect for him as a coach.”
Getting Back on Track
Despite falling in the national polls from No. 5 to No. 14 in the country, the Trojans’ championship aspirations have not wavered. After being upset in Pullman, Washington State fans rushed the field (costing the school $25,000) while some USC players entered the locker room in tears. It’s a feeling the Trojans say they never want to feel again. 
“I was looking forward to seeing how they responded and it was an extreme business-like atmosphere,” Helton said. “There was no moping around, no pouting around, they came out here and came to work. I wish we played tomorrow.”
A big part of the Trojans controlling their own destiny starts with more consistent production on offense. With plenty of injuries to the line and receiving core, one player that has stepped up was redshirt sophomore wide receiver Tyler Vaughns. With six catches for 89 yards, Vaughns has stepped up in the absence of veterans to be a reliable option for redshirt sophomore quarterback Sam Darnold. 
“We’ve really been able to see him grow,” Helton said. “Tyler really shined and moving forward, having a Tyler Vaughns, Steven Mitchell and Deontay Burnett can only help you.” 
Darnold said Vaughns’ emergence is huge going forward, especially if injuries continue to plague the already struggling wide receiver corps.
“It’s good to see one of those young guys step up and fill that role,” Darnold said. “He’s a big target out there that you can throw it up to. It just gives you confidence as a quarterback.”

A USC player is under investigation by the Washington State University Police Department after video captured footage of him knocking over a Cougars fan after the Trojans’ loss in Pullman on Friday.
The video shows No. 93 — who is listed as redshirt freshman defensive lineman Liam Jimmons — pushing a fan to the ground with both arms. At least two angles of the incident have been posted online on social media.
“We’ve reached out to see if the athlete wants to talk to us,” said Steve Hansen, the police department’s assistant chief to the Los Angeles Times.
The investigation comes after Washington State received $25,000 worth of fines for fans rushing the field after the upset victory. USC players had to weave through frantic fans on their way to the locker room.
“It was an electric game and a very exciting atmosphere, and the safety of both fans and players always needs to be taken into account,” USC head coach Clay Helton said. “It’s hard. When you have that many fans that excited, they found their way down on the field and makes for a chaotic scene.”

Brennen Lopez | Daily Trojan
After an epic comeback last Sunday against the Oregon Ducks, the No. 7 women’s soccer team (8-1-1) — third in the Pac-12 — will go on the road to Tucson to play Arizona tomorrow night.
Arizona (5-3-2) — fourth in the Pac-12 rankings — last played No. 11 California on Sunday, upsetting the Bears in Berkeley. The game was a very even affair, just like the Trojans’ game against Oregon.  The game was even at 0-0 until the 75th minute when Arizona took the lead via freshman forward Jada Talley’s first goal of the season.  Arizona managed to outshoot the Bears in this game 16-to-13, leading in on-target shots 9-to-4, and forced the Cal goalkeeper into making eight saves.  Arizona’s defense throughout the entire season has been outstanding, only allowing 7 goals in their 10 games this season and holding opponents to 10 shots per game, while at the same time producing over 14 shots per game and scoring 11 goals.  
Gabi Stoian and sophomore defender Samantha Falasco lead Arizona in scoring at 2 goals each this season.  Although the statistic of 11 goals scored in 10 games suggests that the Arizona offense is not prolific, they have not had to be.  The solidity of the Wildcat backline has more than compensated for this lack of goalscoring prowess.  The Trojans must take extreme caution in preventing Arizona from taking an early lead as the solid Arizona backline will give the Trojans trouble in trying to mount a comeback, something that is becoming increasingly common this season.
But perhaps the key player for the Wildcats is senior midfielder Cali Crisler, who has five assists to her name this season.  The Trojans will have to mark her constantly throughout the game to prevent her from setting up her teammates and adding to her assist tally this year.     
The Wildcats are not a team to be overlooked.  Although they are not ranked, they have been extremely tough for some of the top teams in the Pac-12 and nation, with an impressive win against California and a 1-0 loss to No. 2 Stanford, with both games being on the road.  Expect the Wildcats to bring this same enthusiasm and effort to the game against the Trojans as they look to knock-off another nationally ranked powerhouse.  
For the Trojans, scoring will not be a problem, with 20 goals in their opening 10 games.  The defense has also been solid, allowing only 7 goals, the same number as Arizona.  This game will be a great battle between a prolific Trojans’ attack and a stout Wildcats’ defense, with the prevailing side  providing their team with a better opportunity to win.  The Trojans will have to depend on their two leading goal scorers, freshman midfielder Savannah DeMelo and junior forward Leah Pruitt — both on 4 goals — to be on top form in order to break through the Arizona defense and bring back a victory to Los Angeles.  
This game is slated to be a tough fixture for the Trojans, with Arizona boasting a strong home record and only allowing 3 home goals all season.  As long as the USC attack can make progress and pick apart the Wildcat defense, this game should result in a Trojan victory. With a victory tomorrow, the Trojans will improve their record to 9-1-1 and perhaps enter the top 2 of the Pac-12 women’s soccer rankings.

To start their 2017 campaigns, the Los Angeles Rams have competed notably hard under the leadership of new head coach Sean McVay. On Sunday, the Rams traveled to Dallas and beat the Cowboys, an NFC heavyweight in 2016, by a score of 35-30. 
Now with a 3-1 record, McVay seems to have sparked a team that has long hoped for legitimate positive momentum. Perhaps LA sports fans should feel the Rams are the city’s team to watch.
It’s not the 3-1 record that’s so surprising because Rams head coach Jeff Fisher was on the right track in 2016 when he notched three wins in four games. The Rams, though, then went on a furious losing run, dropping 11 of the remaining 12 competitions. They had trouble finishing ball games strong. And even though Fisher signed a two-year extension on Dec. 4, he ended up getting fired eight days later following a 42-14 loss to the Atlanta Falcons.
Case Keenum was the Rams’ starting quarterback for the prosperous spell early in the 2016 season. He was keeping his squad in the games, but wasn’t putting up the big numbers Goff has totaled. In this sense, Fisher was betting on his defense and that Keenum could stay consistent enough on the way to the playoffs. Fisher was wrong, as his players found it difficult to live up to his challenge.
McVay, on the other hand, might be hitting the right cord. Upon his hiring, the Rams’ front office viewed him as a possible motivator and mentor for the Rams’ offense, and specifically quarterback Jared Goff, whose decision making looks much improved from a year ago. Goff started seven games in 2016 and tallied 1,089 yards, five touchdowns and seven interceptions with a quarterback rating of 63.6.
Four games into the 2017 NFL regular season, Goff’s QB rating has soared to 112.2. He has thrown seven touchdowns and only one interception, and his completion percentage (66.7 percent) is high. Goff was holding onto the ball too long at many points in 2016 and wasn’t as confident in progressing through his reads. Maybe, thanks to McVay’s guidance, Goff is developing into a franchise quarterback right in front of our eyes. 
Goff and the Rams’ offense, most notably running back Todd Gurley, is among the best in the NFL, ranking first in points and fifth in total yards. Gurley reeled in seven catches for 94 yards and ran for 121 yards on 23 attempts against Dallas. The former University of Georgia star is the third running back in league history to account for more than 575 yards from scrimmage and seven touchdowns in a season’s opening four games. He’s joined by Hall of Famers Emmitt Smith and Jim Brown.
“Our offense is really going out there and competing and scoring, man,” Rams cornerback Trumaine Johnson told media after the win over the Cowboys. “It’s a great sight to see. I’ve been with the Rams six years. Our offense hasn’t been there. But they’re being consistent. They really are.”
There could be concern, however, about the health of Gurley down the road if he keeps getting so many touches. And his absence in a competition would show the Rams’ true colors, if they’re too reliant on Gurley’s top notch ability or not. 
McVay’s offensive plans may have to undergo a sort of renovation without their elite running back playing. This change would revolve around integrating receivers Tavon Austin, Cooper Kupp, Robert Woods and Sammy Watkins into the offense more effectively. This group is talented, so I think McVay could do it. He also has tight ends Gerald Everett and Tyler Higbee at his disposal.
After all, L.A.’s defense isn’t up to par with the offense, although the play-calling of famed defensive coordinator Wade Phillips has helped in game-defining situations. The Rams’ defense ranks 28th in the league in points allowed and 27th in total yards. So it’s not a team that is bulletproof. We’ve seen multiple teams start a year well, but a couple of injuries can completely alter the nature of that situation.
Then again, the defense might actually be able to afford these injuries so long as the offense can bear the burden of winning games. But over the course of the season, more game film will be available on the Rams’ offense, and opponents will be able to plan accordingly. 
In the end, when the responsibility of winning falls on the LA’s offense, we’ll see if McVay has the answers. You can’t help but think if he’s able to continuously make sound adjustments, the Rams could make the playoffs. Or maybe Phillips’ defense finds a groove, and they’re able to play great complementary football. In either case, it’s doesn’t feel like a typical year for the Rams. And that’s a good thing.

On Monday night, USC students gathered at the Wallis Annenberg Hall Auditorium for a screening of the National Geographic documentary From the Ashes. The film, which premiered at the 2017 Tribeca Film Festival, was produced by Bloomberg Philanthropies and RadicalMedia. 
Journalism professor Mary Murphy moderated the post-screening Q&A session with documentary producer and professor Dan Birman, and Mary Anne Hitt, director of the Sierra Club’s “Beyond Coal” campaign, who also appeared as an expert in the documentary. 
The documentary portrays both sides of the story thoroughly. The stories the directors and producers chose to tell were curated to provide  an accurate depiction of the “war on coal” in the United States. It examines the effects of coal mining in totality — the good, the bad and the ugly. 
As coal becomes a more political topic in the U.S., the people whose lives are affected by it are determined to have their voices heard. The economic necessity of coal mining devastated families in mining towns after activist groups and lawsuits shut down coal factories. Others were upset that pollutants were contaminating their air and water, causing asthma and increased risk of cancer. States became divided over the best way to ensure future economic success — some senators insisted that the demand for coal would soon rise again, while others felt that they needed to create jobs in new industries to adapt to the 21st century economy.
From the Ashes also examines the politics behind this issue, with clips of President Donald Trump’s speeches interspersed throughout the film. Footage was added during the final stages of production to include more relevant context. 
“Most of the documentary was finished before the election,” Murphy said.
Other contributors to the documentary include Carl Pope, an environmentalist and author; Michael Oppenheimer, a climate scientist at Princeton University; and Brandon Dennison, founder of Coalfield Development Corporation. 
“As a region, we’re not ashamed of powering this country for a hundred years,” Dennison said in the documentary. “We’re proud of that and we should be proud of that. But I think that we’re waking up to the realization that if we’re going to survive, we’re going to have to adapt.” 
The film ends with hopeful messages regarding the transition to alternative energy and the success of advocacy groups against coal mining. 
“The best way to honor the sacrifice of the people in Appalachia is to build a diverse economy that sustains the generations,” Hitt said.
After the film, Birman, Hitt and Murphy discussed the journalistic elements of the production as well as its impact on viewers.
“[While] telling a story that has social impact, we better be entertaining the audience, even with an documentary,” Birman said. “And the way that gets done is … you bring people who could articulate those issues efficiently.”
Getting the right sources proved to be difficult at times. However, Hitt noted that Bloomberg Philanthropies’ willingness to provide information gave her a reason to be a part of the documentary.
“How much people will tell you is directly related to how much they trust you to tell their story,” she said.
The journalistic and artistic aspects of the documentary resulted in a thought-provoking experience affecting audiences around the world, in cities like Paris, whose mayor, Anne Hidalgo, is a friend of Bloomberg Philanthropies’ founder Michael Bloomberg. 
Regarding the documentary, Hitt reminded viewers that “stories don’t end,” as discussions on coal mining will continue in the midst of its politicization.

Long-awaited by hungry Trojans who may have spotted it after a workout at the gym only a few steps away, The Baked Bear had its grand opening on Friday afternoon at USC Village. The lucky first 300 Trojans who arrived early enough received blue tickets for free treats from the shop. 
Upon entering the store, friendly customer service  facilitated the experience of ordering desserts. With a giant chalkboard menu outlining a step-by-step process, any feeling of confusion from first-time visitors fades away. A worker greets each customer and moves down the assembly line of ingredients alongside the customer for quick and easy ordering. From making the frosty desserts to ringing up customers at the counter, all store staff members created a friendly, inviting atmosphere for patrons.
The endless combinations of dessert ingredients, as seen on the menu and displayed enticingly behind glass cases, add to the exciting experience. Choices for sandwich tops and bottoms consist of cookies, brownies, doughnuts or a cookie-brownie combination, as well as the 11 different types of cookies. The choices include Funfetti, red velvet and the current cookie of the month, blue Rice Krispie. 
Ice cream flavors range from traditional vanilla and Rocky Road to snazzier flavors such as birthday cake and strawberry cheesecake. However, The Baked Bear also serves desserts beyond ice cream sandwiches. Also served are the Bear Bowl, a cookie or brownie with ice cream; hot fudge sundae, which is served with a cookie or brownie; and root beer float. For simple eaters, the store also offers cookies and brownies separately. 
While its desserts prove undeniably picturesque, the shop’s decorations seem surprisingly too simple for such a popular dessert chain. A simple navy and white color scheme is reflected on the shop’s painted walls. Shades of gray metal from lamps and containers also accent the shop and the glossy, white brick walls in the kitchen area. The only wood-paneled wall stood out, adorned with only the chain’s logo of a polar bear wearing sunglasses while happily biting into its own chocolate-chip cookie ice cream sandwich. Counters where diners eat can be found at one end of the shop but without any chairs for visitors to enjoy the store’s atmosphere.
Moreover, patrons gave mixed reviews of The Baked Bear’s desserts, suggesting that there’s still room for improvement. After trying their first ice-cream sandwiches, students who attended the grand opening agreed that cookie choices like red velvet lacked flavor and that the blue Rice Krispie wasn’t spectacular beyond its unconventional appearance. Customers also commented that the cookies were cold, which could easily be solved with clarification that they can be warmed up. While some praised the incredibly large portion sizes, others complained that they were too sweet and that the large ice cream scoops melted too quickly into sugary messes, softening their cookies. 
On the other hand, The Baked Bear exceeds expectations with its diverse and tongue-tantalizing ice cream flavors, such as its own house special, blue Bear Batter, and the sweet-and-salty Salted Caramel Fudge. While not cheap, The Baked Bear’s desserts also do not surpass the prices of other ice cream sandwich dessert chains.
Though it definitely has room to improve, The Baked Bear redeems itself with outstanding customer service and begins its legacy at USC with a satisfactory premise, drawing students to its shop for frosty treats.

Like every college student, I struggled to settle on a major. Like every college student with immigrant parents, I struggled to settle on a major that would appease their desire for me to have a prosperous, stable career. Unfortunately, I’m not the type to get jazzed about any of the four letters that make up the ubiquitous acronym that has become synonymous with “financial success,” “job prospects” and “upward socioeconomic mobility.”
Not to say that I’m not capable of STEM-ming it up, if I so chose. I’m confident enough in my innate intellect that learning a programming language is not beyond my capacity. I’m also confident that if I spent my life speaking in for-loops that I would end it prematurely. My passions lie with English, not C++. 
It was a conundrum with which I wrestled — was I singlehandedly setting the feminist movement back 50 years if I failed to live up to my (admittedly limited) potential of becoming a software engineer? If I chose the “easy way out” and elected to write stories instead of writing code? Do I “pursue my dreams” or do I settle for a tedious but trustworthy source of income? 
At one point, I even considered becoming an accounting major, until I realized that anyone planning to be an accountant is already dead behind the eyes at the prospect of a future spent analyzing tax returns. 
I initially matriculated at USC as an English major, riding on the promise that I would switch to engineering as soon as I stepped foot on campus. But the months wore on, and I had yet to inquire about the requirements for entry into Viterbi. I was too preoccupied with churning out essays for Thematic Option and articles for the Daily Trojan.
“Have you decided on a major yet?” my mom would ask.
“How are the hydrangeas doing this year?” I’d respond. “I notice the roses are looking a little peaky.” 
But the moment arrived where I could no longer rely on general electives and foreign language requirements to avoid enrolling in major-specific classes. In the end, we settled on a compromise. I get to pursue journalism and linguistics, with a few computer science classes thrown in for good measure, just to make me more “marketable.”   
And my parents, who are both engineers, are, I think, finally coming around. My mom, conceding to my fervent pleading, subscribed to The New Yorker and The New York Times. My dad, counter to my fervent pleading, purchased an Annenberg license plate frame for his car. 
The blurb that runs at the end of my columns is a peace treaty brokered to resolve a long, long conflict that has finally come to a close. 
Kitty Guo is a sophomore majoring in journalism and computational linguistics.  She is also the lifestyle editor of the Daily Trojan. Her column, “Kitty Corner,” runs every other Wednesday.
