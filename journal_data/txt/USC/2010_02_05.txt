Want a high-voltage start to your weekend?
The Natural History Museum, located right off of Exposition and Wyatt Way, will feature energy as the theme for its monthly First Friday. Like all First Fridays, the evening serves up fascinating tours and discussions, as well as entertaining performances and concerts. Kick things off with a tour that centers on energy and how it revolutionized early Los Angeles. Talk turns to the future with CalTech professor Dr. Nathan S. Lewis, who will discuss the commitment required to develop sustainable energy. Prius drivers, your smugness ends here. Finally, the evening tops off with charged performances by Warpaint, Yeasayer, Them Jeans, and Ana Calderon. All musical tastes are welcome, with a topsy-turvery mix of rock, folk, punk, and psychedelic.
First Fridays are part of the museum’s drive to renovate and attract a wider range of audiences. No longer just a place for science fiends and history buffs, the Natural History Museum seeks to make everyone, including kids and college students, interested in the natural world. The museum also wishes to draw more on its local science stars, including USC professors, one of which will be moderating this Friday’s discussion.
First Friday begins at 5:30 p.m. and goes until 10:30 p.m. Just remember to bring your student ID — it will get you in for free.

The No. 2 USC women’s water polo team rung in its new season Thursday night with a convincing 13-3 victory over Long Beach State.
Although widely considered a tune-up match for the critical Stanford Invitational this weekend, the Women of Troy (1-0) wisely did not overlook a young 49ers (0-1) team on the road.
Aside from the competitive opening minutes, the outcome of this game was never really in doubt.
USC outscored Long Beach in every quarter, posting a shutout in the fourth.
Sophomore two-meter Kara-Leigh Huse led the offensive attack with 3 goals, while senior utility Forel Davies and freshman two-meter Patricia Jansco both netted two apiece.
Senior goaltender Tumua Anae was solid, saving four of her seven shots against—a high percentage in water polo.

The No. 9 USC women’s tennis team remained undefeated by capturing its fifth straight win with a 6-1 victory over No. 40 Pepperdine on Thursday afternoon at Marks Stadium.
Attacking · Junior Cristala Andrews (above) combined with freshman Valeria Pulida for a 8-6 win in Women of Troy victory over Pepperdine. - Gary Fung | Daily Trojan 
The strong victory came after the Women of Troy got a four-day break from matches after playing four matches in seven days the week prior.
The doubles matchups were fairly close, but by the end, it was USC who grabbed the doubles point. Sophomore Alison Ramos and freshman Danielle Lao set the tone with a quick victory, 8-2. Juniors Maria Sanchez and Lyndsay Kinstler fell behind early at the No. 1 singles slot but were able to comeback from a 4-6 deficit and win 9-7.
Kinstler got the game and match point to clinch the doubles point. Within a few minutes, USC’s freshman Valeria Pulido and junior Cristala Andrews also topped their Pepperdine opponents 8-6.
In the singles scene, USC rather quickly took the first set in four of their six matches. The momentum remained as Ramos dropped just one game against Pepperdine sophomore Ali Walters, winning easily 6-1, 6-0.
Similarly, Pulido had success in her singles match against sophomore Andrea Oates, taking control early and capturing a 6-3, 6-2 win.
USC was unable to complete a sweep, however, as senior Tania Rice of Pepperdine overtook junior Leyla Entekhabi 1-6, 0-6.
At the top singles spot, Sanchez had a harder time handling freshman Arianna Colffer. The first set was close, back and forth throughout, leading to a tiebreaker first set, but it was Sanchez who won.
Sanchez kept pressing Colffer in the second set, playing aggressively with a one set lead and was able to shut Colffer down late in the second set, finishing off a 7-6, 6-3 victory in the final match to finish for the day.
“This was a huge confidence boost,” Andrews said. “We have  great momentum going as a team right now.”
The Women of Troy will get an extended break after their convincing victory over the Waves. Their next matches won’t come for another eight days, when they travel to Madison, Wisc. to compete in the Intercollegiate Tennis Association’s National Team Indoor Championships.
USC qualified for the competition at last week’s ITA Kick-Off Weekend, where they beat Auburn and San Diego to receive a bid to the tournament.
“It was nice to get the win when we were a little tired from last week so I think everyone is feeling good and confident for ITA Indoors,” Sanchez said.

Once again, a weak spot USC women’s basketball team was exposee. This time it cost the team a win.
California dominated the undersized Women of Troy (13-8, 7-3) on the boards and stole a 61-55 victory Thursday night in Berkeley, Calif.
USC led for most of the game but gave up 23 offensive rebounds and 31 second-chance points to Cal (12-9, 6-4). The Golden Bears outrebounded USC 49-30 overall.
The final minute was a microcosm of the game for the Women of Troy. Consecutive 3-pointers by sophomore guard Ashley Corral pulled USC within two points before the team’s rebounding woes came back to haunt them.
Cal rebounded its own missed free throw twice to put the game away. The Golden Bears made three separate trips to the foul line in the possession and knocked down 4 of 6 attempts.
The Women of Troy jumped out to an early lead in the first half behind a hot start by sophomore guard Briana Gilbreath and contributions from an unexpected source.
After senior forward/guard Aarika Hughes tweaked her ankle on the opening possession of the game, redshirt junior guard Jacki Gemelos checked in and provided the Women of Troy with a spark.
Gemelos gave USC a glimpse of what to expect when the rust accumulated over three years of inaction comes off. She finished with eight points, five rebounds and five assists in her USC debut.
With an assist from Gemelos, the tandem of Gilbreath and Corral carried USC for much of the first half. Combined, the duo had 18 of the team’s first 22 points and paced USC to a 28-23 halftime lead.
A 3-pointer by senior guard Heather Oliver pushed the lead to six points midway through the second half, but the Golden Bears went on a 10-2 run after that to take a lead they would not relinquish.
Cal extended the lead to eight points in the final minute before the near-heroics by Corral. After a 3-pointer by Corral drew the Women of Troy within five points, the Golden Bears turned the ball over and gave it back to USC. Corral knocked down another deep 3-pointer to give the Women of Troy momentary hope.
Corral finished with a team-high 16 points on 7 of 13 shooting. Gilbreath added 12 points but scored just two after halftime.
USC held Cal guard Alexis Gray-Lawson to just nine points but had trouble containing the Golden Bear’s frontcourt. Gray-Lawson entered the game averaging 24 points per game in conference play.
Forward/center DeNesha Stallworth and forward Gennifer Brandon combined for 21 points and 24 rebounds.
USC has lost two straight for the first time since early this season. Next up is a showdown with No. 2 Stanford at 1 p.m. on Sunday.

The No. 13 USC men’s swimming and diving team welcome Pac-10 and in-state rivals No. 4 California and No. 2 Stanford in back-to-back dual meets this Friday and Saturday at the McDonald’s Swim Stadium. Both teams swamped the Trojans last season, and the USC men are looking to make a much bigger splash this time around.
“We expect the guys to rise up to the talent level of Cal and Stanford and compete with some of the best in the country,” senior captain James Martin said.
The Golden Bears boast some of the top swimmers in the nation, including 2009 NCAA Champions Nathan Adrian and Damir Dugonjic, along with six other returning All-Americans.
Freshman French Olympian Clement Lefert, senior Hungarian Olympian Zoltan Povazsay, sophomore captain Patrick White, Martin, and freshman backstroker Alex Lendrum have lead the Trojans (7-1) this season.
USC’s fight against Cal will come down to the middle-distance freestyle races, where the team will be looking to swimmers like Povazsay and White to swim over and above themselves. The breaststroke events will also be key, which will be led on the Trojan side by junior Dillon Connolly.
“The Cal meet will come down to a couple of important races and one is the 100 breast where Connolly, if he performs well, will really turn the tide on the meet,” USC assistant coach Jeremy Kipp said.
The Cardinal squad will be featuring the nations top 100-yard backstroker Eugene Godsoe as well as three of the best middle-to-long distance swimmers in the United States;David Mosko,  Chad La Tourette and Michael Zoldos.
USC will be relying heavily on its British distance star in these races with sophomore Richard Charlesworth looking to start off the competition strong in the opening individual event of the day, the 1,650-yard freestyle.
“Charlesworth is going to have his work cut out this Saturday as Stanford has one of the best       1650-yard [freestyle]  Americans, which will be Charlie’s first big test this season,” Kipp said.
As the last dual meet for the men this season, the team will be honoring graduating seniors Povazsay, Martin and Evan Marcus. Povazsay owns NCAA consideration ‘B’ cuts in the         200-yard (1:36.55) and 500-yard freestyle (4:21.55) and is ranked 12th and ninth in the United States, respectively.
Martin will be the individual medley component for the Trojans this weekend; having already clocked three ‘B’ cuts in the 200-yard (1:49.25) and 400-yard IM (3:49.23) and the 200-yard backstroke (1:46.42).
The Trojan divers competed against Stanford and Cal last weekend during the women’s dual meet, and their scores will be included in this weekend’s results, giving the Trojans a starting lead of 24-14.
“This is a huge plus going into the meet,” Kipp said.

Three weeks ago, UCLA football coach Rick Neuheisel stood in front of a packed crowd at Pauley Pavilion during halftime and delivered a rousing speech about the return of Bruin football. 
“We are not going to rest until we bring back the Pac-10 championship, the Rose Bowl championship and the national championship back to UCLA!” proclaimed Neuheisel, immediately after facetiously welcoming Lane Kiffin to Los Angeles and speaking of a changing status quo within the USC-UCLA rivalry.
The crowd mustered a sizeable cheer, but it was obvious to just about anyone sitting in attendance that Bruin fans had their reservations about lofty claims when it came to football.
After all, UCLA fans have suffered through an entire decade of football mediocrity. Having gone 1-9 against the Trojans (including a 66-19 walloping in 2005), in most years the team couldn’t even leave their own city without those championship hopes being dashed, let alone finish an entire season. UCLA has reached 10 wins only once in that time period, and — despite being the proud owners of a monstrous EagleBank Bowl trophy — has not been able to break into college football relevance.
But last Wednesday — the day in which the large majority of highly prized high school football recruits around the country confirm which college they will attend and play for in the fall — might have been a sign that Neuheisel really does believe in what he is saying.
UCLA stunned the college football world by pulling in one of the best recruiting classes they have seen in years, headlined by highly touted defensive end Owamagbe Odighizuwa, who many consider to be one of the best defensive ends in the country. Overall, the Bruins welcomed 22 new recruits, enough to put them in eighth place on Rivals.com’s top football recruiting classes for 2010.
Whether or not this is bad news for USC, and whether or not Neuheisel is anywhere closer to achieving his somewhat ridiculous goals after Wednesday, this still personally excites me — for it seems that, in the very least, Neuheisel has finally found a way to restore the football side of the cross-town rivalry to its full potential.
As you might have heard, the Trojans haul of recruits this Wednesday was equally, if not more, spectacular than the Bruins. But after recently finding a capable successor in Lane Kiffin to lead the already-successful foundation that USC football has had since Pete Carroll arrived, it was almost to be expected that the Trojans would have little trouble in reloading on talent.
What was less expected, though, was the Bruins ability to keep up.
To see the intriguing part of this whole situation, one has to look beyond loyalties to either team and examine what is at stake.
Consider this: The USC-UCLA rivalry in football has existed since 1929 and has been arguably more influential in creating traditions and shaping the culture at the two schools than any other event they take part in. But as of late, the match up has been lacking; other than the 2005 game, in which the Pac-10 title was still in reach for both USC and UCLA, there have not been equally meaningful implications for both schools in the same game this entire decade.
While many USC fans may prefer it that way, I have no doubt in my mind that many would also prefer to see some sparks every now again; I don’t mean sparks in the form of a late-game touchdown pass when the game is already out of reach but rather in the sense of a season-ending match up in which both teams put everything they have on the line to close out their regular schedule. No rolling over after going down by three scores, no expectations of one last trouncing before a bowl game.
College football is known for its lopsided victories and annual powerhouses. But the work that Rick Neuheisel has done shows that, with enough effort and the right (albeit optimistic) outlook, any program can still be revived.
And as much as I hate to admit it, for the sake of the rivalry — I appreciate his fighting attitude.
“One-Two Punch” runs every other Friday. To comment on this article, visit dailytrojan.com or e-mail James at jbianchi@usc.edu.
Admit it there, University of Second Choice, your school has always been in our shadows academically and soon the tables will turn in our favor in football. Most UCLA undergrad rejects end up at SUC, and soon the our football program will demonstrate likewise. Mr. Opportunistic aka cheaty-Petey left your sinking ship to move onto to bigger things, and your new coach, Lame Kitten, will continue put his foot in his mouth. 
Enjoy your misery, LOL!!!!
Have some class Rich!!!!!
UCLA is athletically and academically inept.
