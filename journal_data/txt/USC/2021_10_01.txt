The door on the fabled “Hot Girl Summer” is effectively closed, and it is no longer only because of the delta variant and the cable knit sweaters emerging from the back of the dresser drawer. The days are getting shorter; the heat waves are letting up and, on a recent drive through the city, I saw a hint of autumnal colors in the foliage. 
I also knew it was fall because the Emmys were at the Microsoft Theatre (maybe it’s because I’m a born-and-bred Angeleno, but I know when my awards shows air). Beyond Rita Wilson — and others — opening the show with the late Biz Markie’s “Just a Friend,” the show was fairly predictable. The cast and crew of “Ted Lasso” ran away with a number of statues as did Netflix’s “The Crown” with Olivia Colman accepting the award for outstanding lead actress with a tearful speech. Though I must admit, I bristled when “Wandavision” went home empty handed. I am still recovering from the “what is grief, if not love persevering” line. 
On the subject of television and the autumnal equinox, it means that many shows are back with a new season. So, I couldn’t help but think about my rule: I don’t allow myself to watch any adaptation of a book without reading the story first. Maybe it’s because I like to set myself up for disappointment with how poor the adaptation might be, or perhaps it is because I’m not a fan of rom-coms and much prefer the sappy, sweet stories in novel form. 
I don’t know about you, but I think I’m a bit of a mood reader. The atmosphere needs to be right, which is why I often reach for contemporary stories in the summer and the more dystopian, fantasy books for the winter. Of course, this means that my favorite adaptation needs to be on the list: “The Hunger Games.” Have you read it lately? Or watched the film? It holds up. In case you haven’t ventured onto the internet in the last 10 years, “The Hunger Games” follows 16-year-old Katniss Everdeen as she is selected to represent her “district” in a dystopian world where she must battle to the death in the (you guessed it!) Hunger Games. Personally, for me, this was the first big adaptation from book to film that led to my (perhaps ill-advised) Katniss Halloween costume. 
But, if we are willing to cycle forward to one of the many big, early quarantine shows, it shows that the book-to-visual media is not at all dead and thrives instead. It is, of course, “Normal People,” adapted originally by the BBC and also streaming on Hulu. The show was in part written by the author of the novel, Sally Rooney, who very quickly rocketed to stardom. What is perhaps most appealing about the novel and the television show is that it is very much “no plot, just vibes.” 
The story follows Marianne and Connell, two secondary school students on opposite sides of the popularity spectrum, as they continue onto college and beyond. The novel itself is a study in modern-day literature and a willingness to push the boundaries of writing norms. For example, the dialogue is not nestled between quotation marks and is only accompanied by a speaker tag such as “she said” and is presented like any other sentence in the rest of the book. Like any story, it is not all perfect, but it is a beautiful tale about the messiness of relationships and social class and growing up and learning about yourself. 
You really are going to need to forgive me, but I’m going to throw a book suggestion to you out of left field. Does the quote “I’m so glad to live in a world where there are Octobers” ring a bell? L.M Montgomery’s classic “Anne of Green Gables” is one I put off reading for a while (for no good reason outside of a passing fear of classics), but I am so delighted I finally burned through the  entire series over the summer. It is quotable, and the writing is so easy to read that it is easy to forget that the first novel came out more than 100 years ago. 
In case you’re unfamiliar, “Anne of Green Gables” follows orphan girl Anne Shirley as she is mistakenly sent to live with the middle-aged Cuthbert siblings and figures out life on Canada’s Prince Edward Island. The reason I’ve included this classic in a series of adaptations is due to it not only having two separate film adaptations (that I have not watched) but  also received the television treatment with Netflix’s “Anne with an E,” and while it is not entirely faithful, it is nevertheless delightful. 
Midterms have arrived and that means that the workload may feel a bit like an overwhelming wave crashing around you, so maybe, once you find a sliver of time, you might be inclined to switch on the 2012 “The Hunger Games” film or pick up a new book. You can find me at Doheny — attempting to study but instead getting wrapped up in a story. What can I say? Sometimes my latest novel is more interesting than the essay due tomorrow.

Content warning: This article contains references of illicit drug consumption and sexual abuse. 
To diffuse an ongoing drug-fueled dispute, USC attorneys agreed to a settlement that paid $1.5 million to Sarah Warren and her family in November 2017. The settlements occurred under the condition that the Warren family would relinquish photo and video evidence of ex-dean of the Keck School of Medicine Carmen Puliafito engaging in sexual activity and illicit drug consumption, the Los Angeles Times reported Thursday. 
Sarah Warren, 21 years old at the time, overdosed in a Pasadena hotel room after Puliafito gave her gamma-hydroxybutyrate, a sedative sometimes used in small doses as an intoxicant and also commonly abused as a “date-rape drug.”
Ten days following the incident, an anonymous witness called former USC president C.L. Max Nikias who described Puliafito’s involvement with Warren’s overdose, according to the L.A. Times. 
Shortly after the witness contacted the University, Puliafito submitted his resignation in March 2016. Following his resignation, the L.A. Times uncovered a history of Puliafito engaging in prohibited activities with criminals and drug users during his tenure as dean. Warren met Puliafito in 2015 as a sex worker and said Puliafito used methamphetamine and other drugs during parties inside the dean’s office.
The California Medical Board launched an investigation into Puliafito after learning from the L.A. Times that he used methamphetamine and other drugs extensively when he served as dean. On Sept. 27, the board voted to suspend his medical license pending a final decision on his fitness to practice.  
When Warren’s parents threatened to sue the University after details of the dean’s companionship with their daughter surfaced, USC officials offered the Warrens compensation in exchange for all documentation of Puliafito’s drug use, the L.A. Times reported. 
In response, the Warrens agreed to turn over all incriminating evidence to USC officials. The L.A. Times’ investigation found the University destroyed videos and photos depicting Pulifaito’s infidelity, along with other information tying his misconduct to the University. As of Sept. 30, it is unclear if USC officials obtained copies of the Warrens’ records.
A University spokesperson declined to provide comment to the Daily Trojan or the L.A. Times on whether they have copies of the destroyed information. 
“We don’t have anything to add beyond what was reported in the Los Angeles Times,” the spokesperson said.
While President Carol Folt denied an interview request with the L.A. Times, a spokesperson from her office stated it would be inappropriate for her to comment as she did not serve in USC leadership when the settlement was reached. 
The settlement between USC and the Warrens prohibits the family from disclosing any of the details of the case to the public.
Puliafito’s record of misconduct doesn’t stop short of his time at USC. Prior to joining the University as Dean of the Keck School of Medicine, Puliafito was director of the University of Miami’s Bascom Palmer Eye Institute from 2001 to 2007. During his tenure at the institute, the University of Miami investigated Puliafito for claims of sexual harassment. 
In addition to the allegations of unwanted sexual advances, Marc Brockman, a colleague of Puliafito who worked as an optometrist, filed a suit against Puliafito for assault and battery in 2006. Puliafito denied all wrongdoing, and he and the University of Miami reached a separate settlement with Brockman in June 2007, the L.A. Times reported. Two months after the settlement, USC hired Puliafito as dean.
Correction: the headline was updated to provide more context. 
A previous version of this article incorrectly stated that The District Attorney’s office is currently deliberating over whether to bring felony charges against Puliafito. Deputy Dist. Atty. Mark Burnley wrote that “the current state of the case does not establish sufficient evidence to prove the charges beyond a reasonable doubt,” according to the Los Angeles Times. The Daily Trojan regrets these errors.

Every Friday afternoon, Naomi Gau dons her business casual attire and walks backward through Hahn Plaza, providing information and anecdotes about her undergraduate experience to prospective students through her job as a Student Ambassador with USC’s Admission Center. But for the past year, she and her coworkers have given tours from behind their laptop screens. 
Campus’ closure in March 2020 forced not only traditional classes to an online format but also events for USC’s prospective student population. Though in-person campus tours recently resumed in June in an altered format consisting of smaller group sizes and a shorter tour route, the pandemic’s forced addition of a virtual facet to traditional college recruitment is one that is here to stay. 
In a statement to the Daily Trojan, David Kirschner, associate dean of admissions and financial aid at the Gould School of Law, wrote that the department first attempted to replicate its pre-existing in-person events into a virtual format. When the school realized the pandemic would not be ending soon, the team developed additional virtual programming, including daily virtual office hours, information sessions on the application process and panels in partnership with other law schools such as Columbia Law School and the University of Oregon School of Law. One event that would not have been possible in person, according to Kirschner, was the “Open Access: Inside Legal Education with Law School Deans” webinar panel which was met with success and will continue on its second year. 
“[The panel] was spearheaded by Dean [Andrew] Guzman at Gould and [included] deans from five other leading law schools across the nation and explored a variety of topics of interest to prospective law students,” Kirschner wrote. “Bringing together six deans from across the country in person would not be feasible.” 
Since April, Gau conducted more than 50 in-person and virtual campus tours via Zoom. Gau said she loves connecting with prospective students and their families, but the virtual format creates limitations on the degree to which Gau can interact with her guests on tours. 
“I don’t want to call it impersonal, but that’s how most people feel about Zoom; there’s just that level of connection that you don’t get,” Gau said. “In person … maybe I’m midway through campus, and I take a pause from just spewing facts [to say] ‘Oh, I actually had lunch here yesterday; this is my favorite restaurant on campus!’ Little back-and-forth stuff is the main difference of virtual programs and in-person programs.” 
However, Gau said she believes online admission events have increased the University’s outreach to prospective students. Compared to an in-person tour — which is currently capped at 18 people, with a prior capacity of 30  — online webinars can host up to 85 participants for a single session. 
Director of Undergraduate Admission Kirk Brennan wrote in a statement to the Daily Trojan that despite the comeback of in-person tours on campus, students’ interest in attending virtual programming “remains very strong.” 
“That’s great for USC because students from all over, including neighborhoods or countries we could never visit, are able to connect with us like never before,” Brennan wrote. 
In a statement to the Daily Trojan, Director of the Admission Center and Visitor Relations Joe Beltran said virtual programming has “been an essential way for [the department] to connect with prospective students and families with limited travel resources and opportunities.” In a standard week, the department provides three information sessions for first-year applicants, one information session for transfer applicants and three virtual tours and panels led by five to seven Student Ambassadors. 
“Touring a college campus is a privilege, so we are happy to continue our Zoom webinars where we ‘bring’ USC and some of our Student Ambassadors to prospective students around the world regardless of their travel means,” Beltran wrote. 
Gau said online programs offer unparalleled accessibility for international Trojans to get a glimpse into USC student life.
“Not everyone can afford to fly to L.A. and a hotel for one or two days. It is very expensive, and it’s a privilege to be able to visit universities,” Gau said. “As tour guides now, we’re very cognizant of that fact. We want to open up as [many] opportunities for prospective students to see the campus and I think virtual programs have been a really wonderful way for us to do that.” 
Expanding outreach also means that future incoming classes of Trojans may become further diversified as more people attend recruitment events virtually. Elijah Jhee, a freshman majoring in cognitive science, believes the Trojan student body has much to gain from increased recruitment outreach.
“There are no physical barriers to online events, so therefore we can allow for people far away, whether it be in the East Coast or literally across the globe,” Jhee said. “I think that’s a really important step that USC should consider if they want to have a college body that’s made up [of] more than just [students from] Southern California.” 
Though Gau said in-person tours allow for greater interpersonal bonding, prospective Trojans have shown appreciation for the options that do exist for them to connect with the University. 
“A lot of times the comments [on Zoom] are just like, ‘Thank you so, so much for doing this. I would not have been able to visit even if we weren’t in a pandemic, so thank you for spending an hour on Zoom with me,’ and those messages are just so heartwarming,” Gau said. “This is why we’re tour guides. We love being able to give back to USC as a whole and that includes our prospective students.” 
Each campus tour of USC, both in-person and online, ends with the “Tommy section,” where tour guides share their stories as to why they chose to attend USC and advice customized to each tour group. Such stories may not come across as personally as they would in-person through an online format, especially because webinars do not have a participant gallery. 
“Seeing those smiles at post-tour, when a mom is crying from our personal story — I resonate so much with it,” Gau said. “[One moment that stuck out to me] was on my very first tour. I had a great group and at the end after I’d given my Tommy Section, there were some tears in the audience. The students are like, ‘I resonate so much with your story,’ and the moms ask, ‘Can I take a selfie with you?’ … I’m a very open person, and I think that’s only a good thing — when people know that other people are going through the same struggle. I love seeing those reactions and I love telling my story.” 
However, Jhee said he thinks online events should be seen as more of a substitute to on-campus programming as USC transitions back to an in-person setting. 
“In a post-pandemic world, it should be that the main event is in-person and online supplements are there to help cater toward people who live far away,” Jhee said. 
Kirschner said that through Gould’s virtual programming, he’s found that virtual events can reach a larger audience because of their ability to be made available on-demand and the lack of barriers to access. Kirschner said that, moving forward, Gould will most likely continue to offer both virtual and live admissions programming.
“Ultimately, I believe the path forward will involve a combination of both virtual and in-person events so that we can reach the largest audience possible while maintaining the personal touch that in-person events foster,” Kirschner wrote. 
For Brennan, meeting virtually will emerge as an essential addition to the college admission toolkit. 
“Nothing can replace connecting with this incredible USC community in person, but Zoom enabling so many to connect with USC is changing the game,” wrote Brennan.

As some of us picked up new hobbies to occupy ourselves during quarantine — with loaves of bread burnt, mountains of crochet tangled — Remi Frolichman-Gonzales decided to launch a handcrafted fashion brand as a pastime. Such an ambitious endeavor was but a natural conclusion of her curiosity, an artistic foray into a new medium which sustains her never-ending creativity.
A third-year student majoring in fine art at the Roski School of Art and Design, FroGo (a delightful portmanteau of her two last names) has pursued the arts since the moment she could twirl a pencil. As far as she can remember, there has never been a day that FroGo hasn’t chased her avidity head on. Her devotion to fine art started as a small hobby but quickly flourished as she fell in love with it.
“When I was really young, I just started with drawing,” FroGo said. “But then I asked to go to art classes … What I started with, mainly when I was maybe seven or so, was oil paint.” 
FroGo, born and raised in Orange County, attended the Orange County School of the Arts and later advocated for her arts education to continue at a higher level by coming to Roski. Thankfully, she again found the full support of her family.
“I was definitely very fortunate in what my parents supported,” FroGo said. “I went to an arts high school from 7th grade through 12th grade … and my parents have been very on-board with it. I know there are definitely other aspects of my family and extended family that wouldn’t be the same way.”
That support encouraged FroGo to experiment with an array of art forms over the years. She honed her oil painting, worked with acrylic, produced photography, made prints and used graphic design in her work. A self portrait she completed in December 2018 even placed first in the Congressional Art Competition, after which the painting was displayed in the United States Capitol.
FroGo’s art is unabashedly bold, with vibrant colors and strong details. The diversity of her formats is reflected in their varying styles, from photorealism in her older work to abstract design in her recent pieces.
“I think my [artistic] range comes from my range of influences, because I do have references that are very realistic and very traditional, and references that are much more modern, like graphic design,” FroGo said.
Since beginning her studies at Roski, Remi notes her style evolved to incorporate more of the contemporary design elements she admires such as “1960s psychedelic poster design and editorial style photography,” a compelling contrast with her more traditional roots.
“For a while my paintings, a lot of them came from photos that I liked enough that I wanted to see it bigger on a canvas,” FroGo said. “More recently, I’ve merged my use of Photoshop with my painting techniques and messed around with images, designed stuff on software first, and then brought them onto a painting.”
When the coronavirus pandemic forced a halt to her freshman year at USC and a quarantine in her home, Remi felt as if the inventive spark which had driven her for so long had sputtered.
“From my perspective, I felt like [quarantine] really hindered everything,” FroGo said. “Really not having a routine every day, it just kind of felt like I was falling behind and not creating a lot.”
In an effort to revive her artistic curiosity, FroGo launched a full-fledged online boutique called FROGO — a shop full of items she hand-painted or sewed together from scrap materials and a complete graphic branding scheme. In one eager swing of pent up artistry, FroGo undertook the work of an entire team of designers, including those of forms she had never before handled.
“I was not in school, I was at home. I didn’t have much to do,” FroGo said. “So I just started painting on clothes and sewing. It was probably at its peak during quarantine … [but] I still take orders and everything.”
Though FroGo found joy in exploring a new creative space, she found a vital aspect of her work missing prior to her return to campus this fall: collaboration.
“A big thing I noticed during the pandemic was that not being around other creatives is probably what took me down the most,” FroGo said. “Just being around other people, creating, seeing what they’re doing — I think that’s probably the most valuable thing.”
Though painting is usually a solitary activity, FroGo finds collaboration with other artists, professors and even her audience imbues her with inspiration. She has worked on the design team of RoskiMag, and has overseen the design and marketing teams of Mash Magazine and Bloom Boutique respectively, and even served as an art camp instructor for kids. One of her closest collaborators is Ellie Williams, a junior majoring in popular music performance and a musician with whom FroGo has worked on multiple album covers, posters and photo shoots.
“She has this really great ability to understand what you want for yourself, even if you don’t know how to communicate it fully,” Williams said. “[She’s] able to put that thought and vision into words and into an actual product, which has always been amazing to see happen.”
Williams continues to work with FroGo on the pair’s combined artistic endeavors, from video shoots to merchandise design. She notes that FroGo is a wonderful “influence and energy to have in [her] life,” making her a joy to collaborate with and an inspiration for Williams to continue improving. 
Julia Lin, another of FroGo’s close friends and a junior majoring in journalism, also gives a glowing commendation of her affability and imagination.
“She’s the best,” Lin said. “She’s so kind, and just constantly creating — even when she doesn’t know that she is. Like, she’s just doodling and I’m like ‘That’s the best thing I’ve ever seen, how do you do that?’ And she’s like, ‘I didn’t even know I was doing anything!’”
Lin said she loves how FroGo’s work is “always just so bright and vibrant and kind of makes your day and brings joy, which I think is something that’s so necessary right now. I love that her art always reminds me to smile.”
While her new brand thrives — supported by custom orders, feedback from fellow artists and a constant presence on her friends’ social media — FroGo isn’t too preoccupied by her future career prospects to focus on everyday life.
“I’ve never settled on anything specific,” FroGo said. “I think anything involving either graphic design or fine art … But, if I’m creating, and I’m liking what I’m doing, then I’m cool with it.”
Whatever path Remi takes — or, rather, paths — she is certain she will continue to imbue her art with the same interactive spirit which brings such value to her life and work.
“I aim for the viewer’s own interpretation,” FroGo said. “I can make any concept that I want to attach to [a] piece, [but] I’m just going to let the viewer understand it themselves … I will make something because I want to make it and then, later on, as the viewer myself, put [my own] meaning to it.”
Julia Lin formerly served on the Daily Trojan masthead.

As the Trojans continue their Pac-12 schedule against Colorado, here are five names to look out for.
Drake London
One of junior quarterback Kedon Slovis’ favorite targets, junior wide receiver Drake London has continued to be a standout for USC. London has eclipsed 100 receiving yards in three of USC’s first four games this season.
“He’s a beast,” interim head coach Donte Williams said. “I’ve always said that from day one before the season started. I said that’s the Biletnikoff winner, so nothing is shocking me that he’s doing.” 
London currently leads the country in receiving yards with 540.
“It’s definitely pretty cool, but I’m not too focused on that right now,” London said. “I’m just trying to get some wins and some W’s.” 
Gary Bryant Jr. 
Sophomore wide receiver Gary Bryant Jr. has proved himself in these past two games, scoring touchdowns in both. 
With 89 yards and second in touchdowns behind London, Bryant Jr. is third on the team in receiving behind London and redshirt sophomore Tahj Washington. Look for him to have another big role in the offensive game plan against Colorado.
Keaontay Ingram
Another key player for USC is transfer senior running back Keaontay Ingram. He leads the team with 225 rushing yards. 
Ingram finished the last game with 79 rushing yards and two touchdowns. 
“He’s healthy; he ran the ball physically; he made some guys miss in this past game, so I think that’s only going to improve,” Williams said. “It’s all about rhythm, so I think he’s starting to find his groove, and it’s going to continue to get better.” 
After a 27-point outing last weekend, Ingram seems confident about the offense going into this week.
“I feel like we need to feed off of each other,” Ingram said. “When we can bounce off each other, put all the pieces together, I feel like we can score easily like 50, 60 points.” 
K.D. Nixon 
Redshirt senior wide receiver K.D. Nixon played four seasons at Colorado before transferring to USC as a graduate student in the spring. Over his four years at Colorado, Nixon had 1,250 receiving yards for seven touchdowns. 
So far this season, he has only  two receptions for 19 yards. Nixon is surely due for more action against his old team.
Drake Jackson
Junior outside linebacker Drake Jackson has shown a consistent strength in the USC defense this season. 
Jackson is one of the team’s best pass-rushers with 13 tackles, a sack and an interception this season. 
USC’s game against Colorado will kick off Saturday at 11 a.m. at Folsom Field.

Anthony Davis is finally set to play center. 
It has taken years to get to this point.
In New Orleans, Davis played next to the likes of Omer Asik because he was so dead set on playing power forward. When Davis forced his way to Los Angeles, he made it clear he didn’t want to play the center position before the season even started, telling reporters during 2019 Media Day, “I like playing the four, I’m not even going to sugarcoat it. I like playing the four, I don’t really like playing the five.”
Davis has never been a full-time five. In high school, he played point guard where he developed his ball handling and perimeter touch, before a growth spurt forced him to change positions. When he got to Kentucky, Davis spent most of his minutes at power forward, winning the NCAA Basketball Tournament’s Most Outstanding Player award.
In the NBA, there is an increased level of physicality compared to college basketball. Battling down low night in and night out against players like Nikola Jokic and Joel Embiid isn’t fun for anyone, let alone a guy like Davis who carries a massive offensive burden as well. 
Davis prefers to play the weak-side help role from the power forward spot, using his long arms and athleticism to atler shots or close out to shooters on the perimeter. He doesn’t have to box out burly centers and man the middle himself when he’s playing the four.
Heading into the preseason, the theme of this years’ Lakers squad is sacrifice. 
“You do what it takes for the betterment of the team,” Russell Westbrook said to Spectrum Sportsnet on Media Day Tuesday. “When you want to win, nothing can get in the way of that, the sacrifices you have to make.”
On a team with LeBron James, Russell Westbrook and Anthony Davis, sacrifices are going to have to be made. Westbrook may not get his 20 points per game or his usual triple-double. James might not get to pound the ball as often as he’s used to, he might find himself off-ball a lot more this season. 
For Davis, sacrifice means putting his body on the line on a nightly basis, playing the center position for the betterment of the team. 
And that’s really all it comes down to — the team is just so much better when Anthony Davis plays the five. When the Lakers made their 2020 bubble run to the title, Davis played 60% of his minutes at center in the playoffs and was absolutely dominant, averaging 27.7 points and 9.7 rebounds per game on 57% shooting. 
Offensively, Davis at the five spells trouble for any opposing team. It’s a lot tougher on a Jokic or an Embiid; centers can’t just hang around the paint when guarding Davis but rather have to match up with him every possession, guarding pick-and-roll or handoff actions. Davis’ agility at his size also makes him more difficult to defend for slower centers, compared to faster power forwards.
The spacing Davis brings to the table is essential with a non-shooter in Westbrook running the point. Instead of having a traditional center clogging up the paint, with his man patiently waiting for James to drive, now the opposing center can only be two or three steps away from Davis at the three point line. 
This opens up driving lanes for Westbrook and James, who will put immense pressure on the rim every game. Inserting two guys who can shoot the ball in — Wayne Ellington and Trevor Ariza — in the starting lineup creates even more space for the Big 3 and an even bigger nightmare for the rest of the NBA. 
Davis’ ability to switch at center transforms head coach Frank Vogel’s defensive gameplan, giving him a longer leash to play with pick-and-roll coverages. The name of the game in modern basketball is versatility, and Davis’ unique two-way traits are extreme difference-makers when he is the lone big on the floor. 
Davis is a one-of-a-kind unicorn at power forward. It’s going to be scary hours for the league when the unicorn slides to his natural position. If he can stay healthy, I predict the Lakers will win 60-65 games with Davis at the five.

Men’s tennis will send three Trojans to Tulsa, Okla. Friday to compete in the St. Francis Health System ITA Men’s All-American Championships. USC looks to build on its solid performances against Georgia, Texas and Ohio State last week at the Southern Intercollegiates tournament. 
Senior Stefan Dostanic and freshman Peter Makk had notably impressive performances, head coach Brett Masi said.
“We got some good wins, Stefan [Dostanic] won the tournament. That’s his second tournament victory in a row,” said Masi in an interview with the Daily Trojan. “Peter Makk came away with an awesome victory on day one and on day three.”  
Masi noted the growth and development beyond the stat sheet this weekend was important going forward, despite USC not finishing with an ideal record in the competition. Since the team is now able to travel to away tournaments after they were canceled due to the coronavirus, bonding is very important to Masi.
“It’s nice to just eat meals together, or after matches, you’re sitting there hanging out together and watching football,” Masi said. “That was at least one week where we were all together. It was really good.”
Dostanic, alongside senior Bradley Frye and sophomore Lodewijk Weststrate, qualified for the singles tournament and will travel to Tulsa to compete.
The Trojans begin play on Monday and Tuesday with matches in the qualifying singles tournament. Dostanic, Frye and Weststrate will each look to earn one of eight qualifying positions for the main draw tournament beginning Wednesday. 
Dostanic and Frye also qualified for the main doubles draw and did not have to play in the qualifying tournament. They will begin competition as a pair on Wednesday following the qualifying doubles tournament. 
Masi is confident that all three Trojans competing this weekend will continue to develop their skills as the season progresses. Dostanic in particular, who won his first two singles tournaments, will look to continue his earlysuccess.
“I got to think that Stefan [Dostanic] feels pretty good after his first two tournaments, knowing where he’s at is going to hopefully give him some a boost to go to All-Americans next week and maybe make a good run,” said Masi.
USC joins a number of schools across the country competing to improve their individual rankings and prepare for the spring season. 
This weekend’s tournament is another test to see how USC stacks up compared to the rest of the country. Masi is eager to improve every week and put the team in the best position possible to win.
“When we [all] play again in October, those things … we didn’t do well this week or the first two tournaments, we’re ready to change those and play better when we hit them again,” Masi said. 
The Trojans begin singles tournament play Monday and doubles tournament play Wednesday in Tulsa.

USC wrapped up competition last weekend by winning the MPSF Invitational Tournament to extend its undefeated start and pick up its 10th straight win. The Trojans were rewarded as they now rank No. 1 in the CWPA after jumping ahead of No. 2 UCLA. 
Senior goaltender Nic Porter received some hardware for his performance last weekend, the first Trojan to be named an MPSF Player of the Week this season. Porter got the award after having 33 total saves throughout the tournament and helping anchor USC’s defense.
Another positive this past weekend was the debut of redshirt junior driver Ashworth Molthen, who missed the first seven games of the season. Molthen contributed early and often as he scored in both the semi-final and final last weekend, recording a hat-trick in the final. 
“It definitely felt great getting to play with these guys … [my] first game as a Trojan it was great to be playing with everyone.” Molthen said. “From lining up against these guys to playing with them has been a great experience so far, and [I] hope to continue it.”
Molthen optimizes USC’s extensive depth at just about every position. With Molthen in the lineup, the Trojans look like a force to be reckoned with on the offensive end.
After defeating multiple top-ranked opponents the last few weeks, USC faces only one team this weekend, a team they have not beaten since 2018. The last two times the Trojans played Pacific, they lost by one goal in each game. However, players are confident in its ability to get the job done this weekend.
USC has beaten Pacific 53 times while losing 11. The Tigers aren’t as hot of a team as the Trojans at the moment, but USC doesn’t pay attention to that and prides itself on “always [respecting] your opponent, and always [respecting] the game,” according to head coach Marko Pintaric.
“They have a very talented group of guys; even though they picked up some losses on the season, their roster is very talented.” Pintaric said. “It’s our job as coaches to prepare our team under pressure.”
Although USC hasn’t played Pacific in two years, grad transfer 2-meter Wyatt Barker played for Pacific for three years before coming to USC.
“I’m familiar with the coaching staff, the play style, as well as some of the guys there and built a lot of really strong relationships.” Barker said.“I think that can bring something unique to this matchup this weekend.”
USC holds breadth of experience from national team play to even professional play on its roster, and Barker is another player who can help bring a unique perspective and experience to this matchup.
The Trojans look to keep their unbeaten streak alive this weekend and get their 11th  win of the year. USC hosts Pacific at 1 p.m. Saturday at Uytengsu Aquatic Center.

Freshman 15: It’s become a universally-accepted maxim that students take as a foreboding of their inevitable college weight gain. Hence, college students often enter school with low expectations of the quality of their food. Students often admit they only ate two meals that day or stocked up at the local Trader Joe’s to compensate for the lack of available healthy food options. 
While some consider USC’s meal options sub-par, with others considering them sorely insufficient, USC is bereft of diverse dining options and more specifically, a variety of healthy options. 
USC offers three dining halls and a variety of dining spots, including the six at Ronald Tutor Campus Center: Seeds Marketplace, The Kitchen, Burger Crush, Panda Express, Verde and C&G Co. While nine dining options may seem adequate at face value, their restrictive hours often leave students with just a few options at their disposal. For instance, C&G isn’t open on weekends and The Kitchen is indefinitely closed. 
Students are left at a crossroads because they pay such an exorbitant price for their meal plan but have such few options that comply. For example, Seeds only has nine student meal plan lunch options. Limited dining options lend themselves to unhealthy meal options. 
Students with dietary restrictions or health conscious attitudes are left to suffer. Ironically enough, USC hosted a Zoom for faculty and staff — “Healthy Habits Webinar Series” — and one section focused on “Healthy Food and Fitness on Campus.” Some of their suggestions included ordering brown rice sushi or super greens from Seeds, choosing brown rice and mushroom chicken from Panda Express, adding guacamole to your bowl at Verde and customizing an acai bowl from C&G to lower sugar and calorie intake.
While USC offers these Zoom sessions to educate students on healthy alternatives, it’s disappointing that its suggestions require actual payment. The Cardinal meal plan, the cheapest and most rudimentary meal plan, costs $3,315 per semester. Students shouldn’t be forced to pay more money just so they can get daily nutritious meals. By the same token, students confined to the meal plan shouldn’t be forced to have the same bowl from Verde or the same protein smoothie from C&G just because those are the only seemingly healthy options. 
Students’ mood, study habits and stamina depend on what they put in their bodies. There have been a number of studies to evaluate whether or not there’s a causal relationship between diet and school performance. 
For example, Michelle D. Florence, Mark Asbridge and Paul J. Veugelers, faculty members at Dalhousie University, conducted a study to examine the effects of diet quality on academic performance. They concluded there is an association between diet quality and academic performance among school-aged children, thereby showing the importance for schools to offer healthy food options earlier in a child’s development. 
Additionally, a longitudinal study of weight gain in freshman students found there to be some validity to the Freshman 15 phenomenon. Researchers found “that first year university students on average gained 1.36 kg (3lbs) (CI: 1.15–1.57) over a period of 6 weeks to eight months.” They also concluded that 60.9% of freshman students gained weight, with 9.3% of first-year students gaining at least 15 pounds. 
As freshmen find their footing and slowly acclimatize to new meal and fitness schedules, weight gain — to some extent — is both predictable and understandable. This can be exacerbated by student’s tendency to stress-eat when overwhelmed with work. While USC could maneuver this by offering courses on healthy eating habits, weight gain on such a large scale is concerning and must be addressed. 
The aforementioned studies justify why USC should offer more healthy options to better help students thrive in the academic and social setting. Beyond the general importance of having a healthy palette, college is where students begin developing and honing their daily habits, and these habits often transcend beyond their four years and take root in their adult life. Unsurprisingly, studies show that unhealthy college eating habits are a contributing factor to the obesity epidemic that plagues the United States. 
USC has the power to offer more dining options on its meal plans while simultaneously boasting more healthy alternatives, which would allow students to prioritize their health. They say college is the start of the rest of your life, so shouldn’t we be able to start that life on a healthy note?

We’ve all been there: frantically watching as classes fill up on Web Registration, preferred time slots close and the 5.0 professors on RatemyProfessor become unavailable. Eventually, we begrudgingly give up on an ideal class and look for its replacement.
When registering for our general education courses, this situation is ever so common. Although some students may genuinely seek to expand their academic horizons through general education classes, most students simply want an easy A with minimal effort. These courses — originally intended to establish a clear standard of academia at the college-level — instead manifest as redundant and tedious subjects far from the student’s interests or major. 
While the General Education program is an integral part of the educational experience within most colleges in the United States, it’s also outdated. As a school that heavily values interdisciplinarity, USC would benefit from abolishing the current system and replacing it with an educational program that prioritizes individuals’ interests to most efficiently educate its students.
Upon entering USC, all undergraduates enroll in courses that fulfill GE program requirements. The University requires this in order to educate students on essential knowledge at the college-level. 
However, these requirements are redundant within an academic institution as prestigious as USC. With competitive admissions cycles and acceptance rates as low as 12% in 2021, USC admits students who have already proved themselves worthy. These students have already demonstrated a qualifying degree of proficiency to match the school’s standards, and most have already taken core classes in high school. Ultimately, repeating these core classes as GE requirements is redundant and unnecessary. 
Additionally, although some may find GE classes valuable for encouraging well-roundedness within the student body, college should be a time to hone in on the subject of one’s interest, which is why they declare majors. Rather than spending time on a class of mediocre interest, students could spend that time delving deeper into their passions and interests. 
For students who are undecided or wish to dip their toes into a variety of majors, the GE program can remain an option. However, USC offers a plethora of ways to find areas of interest without having to implement such a program. For instance, various on-campus clubs such as academic societies, professional fraternities and student-run organizations frequently offer tastes of certain disciplines, which allow students to gauge their interest without having to first take a semester’s worth of classes. 
Another inherently flawed aspect of the GE program is the general attitude many students have toward their classes. When the University requires classes outside one’s interests in order to graduate, students seek classes that require low effort so they can maintain their GPA. Consequently, students fail to actually educate themselves on the topic.
In the GE program, students garner little passion for their education. Thus, to create the optimal educational experience, USC should encourage students to wholeheartedly chase their passions so they learn for the sake of learning. 
By implementing such measures and allowing students to take classes they genuinely enjoy, USC will also expand and encourage interdisciplinary learning modes. With the extra space in their schedules, students would have a greater probability of pursuing additional majors and minors, leading to an improved education system with well-rounded students.
Although college is a time of exploration, discovery and change, strict sets of GE requirements do the opposite of fostering curiosity by stifling one’s intellectual curiosity. For USC to provide its students with an optimal education that matches the school’s values and prestige, GE requirements should be ditched and replaced with genuine modes of learning to foster the growth of passionate and proud Trojans.
