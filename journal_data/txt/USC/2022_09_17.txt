Former USC water polo coach Jovan Vavic, who was found guilty of fraud and bribery charges by the Massachusetts District Court in April, had his conviction overturned by a federal judge Friday. 
Federal Judge Rya W. Zobel found Vavic guilty of accepting bribes from parents to ensure their children admission to USC under the guise of them being athletic recruits. Vavic’s attorneys insisted he never accepted bribes and was only raising money for the school through wealthy donors. 
Federal Judge Indira Talwani determined Friday that the prosecution made a false statement during closing arguments when attempting to prove that the bribes served Vavic’s interests and harmed the University.
“When [Vavic] was taking money to the water polo team, … he was acting contrary to the University’s interests … He was acting for his team and his interests,” government attorneys Leslie Wright, Stephen Frank and Ian Stearns said during trial. “He didn’t want [the money] to go to the University … He actually complains about the fact that somebody gave money to the University and not to his team.”
These closing statements implied to the jury that Vavic used the money he was bribed with for his own personal interests, which impacted the jury’s final decision. However, Talwani found these statements to be false, as the bribes went to the USC water polo team under the guise of donations, not to Vavic specifically. 
There was no evidence of Vavic using the water polo team’s funds for his own benefit, and the prosecution conceded that the funds were not misused by Vavic. Talwani therefore found that the prosecution did not have the right to argue that Vavic benefited from these donations. 
According to Talwani, USC sent out thank-you notes to the families who had donated money, unaware that the payments were accepted in exchange for student admission, and made no attempt to return the money after the reasons for the donations were revealed. This, coupled with the fact that there is nothing inherently illegal about a private institution accepting money in exchange for a student’s admission, made it so the prosecution could not argue that USC was harmed by Vavic’s actions. 
While Talwani concedes that Vavic may have received a career boost by bringing in so much money and that USC’s reputation was damaged when news of these bribes was revealed, neither of these claims create a strong enough basis for a fraud conviction. 
As a result of the inaccurate statement from the prosecution, the jury may have found Vavic guilty based on false evidence, which warranted a new trial. 
In an emailed statement to the Daily Trojan, the University wrote that “while the ruling does not accurately describe USC’s admissions process, we are not a party to this case and do not wish to interfere with the pending court proceedings.”

Former dean of USC’s Suzanne Dworak-Peck School of Social Work Marilyn Flynn agreed Thursday to plead guilty to one count of bribery and pay a fine of no less than $150,000 in a federal case involving politician and former member of the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors Mark Ridley-Thomas.
Prosecutors alleged that during her tenure at USC, Flynn arranged to funnel $100,000 of Ridley-Thomas’ campaign money through USC to a nonprofit managed by his son, Sebastian Ridley-Thomas, in exchange for his vote on a USC Telehealth services contract amendment that Flynn desired. Flynn is set to plead guilty in court on Monday, and it remains unclear whether she will testify against Ridley-Thomas.
According to a Department of Justice press release Thursday, Flynn and Ridley-Thomas concealed the fact that the $100,000 from Ridley-Thomas was intended for USC’s payment to the nonprofit United Ways of California and Policy, Research & Practice Initiative, knowing that USC would not have approved the payment otherwise.
Prosecutors also alleged that Flynn improperly used a vendor account to process the $100,000 payment to the nonprofits run by Ridley-Thomas’ son. According to the DOJ press release, she did this in order to expedite the payment to meet Ridley-Thomas’ deadline. Since United Ways and PRPI were not providing vendor services for USC, her use of the vendor account violated USC policy, the plea agreement said.
In a statement to the Daily Trojan, the University wrote that after learning about Flynn’s “unethical conduct,” the administration quickly disclosed it to the U.S. Attorney’s Office.
“USC strongly supports the School of Social Work and the role it plays in training those who serve the public good,” the statement read.
Flynn will face a maximum sentence of 10 years in prison. According to the press release, prosecutors in the Flynn case have agreed to recommend she satisfy her custodial term with home confinement. They also agreed not to seek a fine of more than $150,000.
According to the University statement, Flynn has not been employed by USC since September of 2018. 
“USC is not a party to the criminal case but respects the judicial process,” the statement read.
Ridley-Thomas was suspended from office pending his trial scheduled for Nov. 15. He pleaded not guilty to one count of bribery, one count of conspiracy, two counts of honest services mail fraud and 15 counts of honest services wire fraud during his time as L.A. County supervisor, according to the press release.
