It’s the middle of a match and women’s tennis sophomore Isabelle Lee is exhausted. Every step slowly becomes a struggle. With each point that passes, it’s more of the same — frustration that it won’t end sooner. 
Tennis matches are often grueling, a marathon that can last up to three hours, testing you physically and mentally. The latter part is as important as the former.
When Lee approaches the bench to rest in between games, she finds the water in her bag and takes exactly four sips: no more and no less. 
“I have to have multiples of four,” Lee said.
It’s her superstition, something she’s stuck by for years because her family has four people. Lee believes that four is now her lucky number.  
As she finishes her sips, Lee picks up her racket, gets off the bench and begins to step back toward the baseline, preparing to either serve or return to her opponent. She pays close attention to what’s happening on the court, but it’s not only where you might expect. 
If she’s serving, Lee examines the amount of “fluff” on the tennis ball — the more the better. After each point, the number of tennis balls on her side of the court is crucial.
“I like to play with the [same] ball if I just won the point, and I like to have all the balls on my side of the court if I’m serving, and I don’t want any balls on my side of the court if I’m returning,” Lee said.
She’s not alone in her superstitions. 
Athletes across various sports at USC are in the same boat. They pride themselves on their superstitions, almost married to them and never forgetting to partake in them. Something as small as what they eat the second they get in the locker room can go a long way. 
For some Trojan athletes, superstitions reign supreme.
How superstitions came to life
The history of superstitions began centuries ago. 
The ancient Romans believed mirrors included fragments of our souls and breaking them signified someone’s broken health. In the middle ages, people began to associate black cats with the devil and a symbol of bad luck.
Superstitions are everywhere too, often embedded in our daily lives without our knowledge. Knocking on wood for good luck, picking a four-leaf clover for prosperity and blessing someone when they sneeze are just many examples. 
Tok Thompson, a USC professor of anthropology and expert in folklore and superstitions, said superstitions are a big part of any culture, including sports. 
However, he points out that superstitions are only prevalent in professions with random chance. 
A person’s superstition helps them mitigate the uncertainty involved with sports. It simply calms them down.  
“People tend to be superstitious in part because they’re in situations where they do not have good control over the outcome,” he said. “There’s a lot of unknowns, a lot of uncertainties.”
Thompson highlighted fishermen, gamblers, farmers and actors as others that are likely to have superstitions. Much of their job is up in the air, therefore, their routines are important to follow for better luck. 
On the contrary, an accountant is less likely to be superstitious because “you could just re-run the numbers again and find out what the problem was.” 
Thompson said the origins of superstitions often rise from traditions. The evil eye is a widespread superstition passed down through generations in the Middle East. Where spitting at someone in America might lead to a Will Smith-esque slap, in Islamic culture, spitting on a person can be seen as a blessing. 
Both of these superstitions existed even before writing, Thompson said. It leaves much at a person’s disposal to pick and choose from in terms of their beliefs. 
“There are traditions of superstition about how these things work,” he said. “And then the individual has to put together their own package of what works for them. You, as an individual, what do you choose to believe in?”
Athletes are in the same boat. Some of the greatest athletes were wildly superstitious. 
Michael Jordan wore his North Carolina shorts under his Chicago Bull shorts before every single game. Serena Williams would wear the same socks throughout a tournament run. And Sundays meant Tiger Woods had to wear a red polo. 
Woods’ superstition began because his mom believes red is his “power color.” Thompson said a superstition from a relationship like Woods and his mom is one of many elements that can impact a person’s beliefs. 
Routines are imperative too, especially if they lead to a victory. But, it also adds some comfort mentally. After losses, Williams would sometimes shift blame to her not properly following her routine, a superstition in itself. 
USC athletes are going through the same things.
From salt in shoes to pizza before games
When men’s basketball sophomore guard Reese Dixon-Waters leaves his house on game days, his gear and bag are necessary. Forgetting your shoes on game day would be disastrous. 
But, he also has a superstition based on a book he read growing up called “Salt in His Shoes: Michael Jordan in Pursuit of a Dream.” The book is almost self-explanatory, focusing on a kid who would put salt in his shoes before every game. It is written by Michael Jordan’s mother, Doloris. 
During Dixon-Waters’ first USC game day in December 2020, his mother sent him a picture of the book — it held a special place in his heart. He proceeded to find the saltiest salt shaker in his kitchen and poured some salt into his shoes, hoping it would give him some good luck.
He’s done it every game day since his first with the Trojans. It makes him feel comfortable.
“For me, I just loved the book so I just took that from it,” Dixon-Waters said. “It makes me feel like when I play well, it’s just a superstition.” 
He has no hopes of ending the superstition either: “I’m for sure doing it this year,” he said. 
USC athletes may not all put salt in their shoes on game day, but meals with salt are often involved in their superstitions.
Football redshirt senior center Brett Neilon likes to have a 20-minute meditation before going out to stretch on the field. But, as soon as he enters the locker room, he makes sure he grabs his favorite snack: a pack of Ritz Sour Cream Bites. 
“They’re like little toasted bites, I don’t know,” he said. “I grabbed them the first game [of the season] and now every time, I have to eat them.”
His teammates, sophomore defensive back Calen Bullock and redshirt freshman defensive back Anthony Beavers Jr., follow a similar routine with food. 
The two roommates prefer Domino’s Pizza, ordering the same pizza the night before a game even if on the road. Just don’t let the football nutritionists find out.
“[It’s the] same pizza, no mix up,” Bullock said. “Probably bacon and pepperoni [pizza].” 
It isn’t just all about food, however. Naps are game-day essentials for some.
At times last season, men’s basketball redshirt junior forward Joshua Morgan found himself unusually tired during games. Even a good night’s sleep wouldn’t make a difference. 
USC’s games usually tip off near 8 p.m., leaving Morgan playing one hour before his usual bedtime. Therefore, he had a simple solution — take naps two to three hours before game time, a necessity he adopted midway through last season. It’s a must for him now. 
“If I don’t get it in, it’s just bad,” Morgan said. 
His teammate, senior guard Boogie Ellis, shares his napping superstition in addition to a few others. If he plays well in a certain shoe, he’ll keep wearing that pair, and he always makes sure to work out the morning before home games.
He acknowledged though that he can’t really do the same during road games. Therefore, the status of working out on game days as a superstition won’t pass the jury.   
For most USC athletes, listening to music on game days is about as important as eating a good meal. Hip-hop is an important part of their routines. 
Ellis prefers rapper Lil Baby. Bullock and Beavers listen to Rod Wave among others. Dixon-Waters enjoys slower music, gravitating toward the legendary Isley Brothers.
Even with the many superstitions among USC athletes, there are some who believe in having none of them — a superstition in itself, one could say. 
Men’s basketball sophomore forward Harrison Hornery keeps it simple on game days. He makes sure to wake up early, then heads to shoot around. After that, much is left up in the air. 
“Whatever happens, happens. I try not to do something in particular because I don’t want to mix it up,” Hornery said. “Stay away from superstitions.”  
Luck might play a role in athletes reaching their full potential, but superstitions add a different layer. It begs the question — is there any relation between superstition and performance? 
Well, that’s still up in the air. 
“I am ready to believe that some athletes do have certain superstitions — how such are attained I know not — but I have no idea at all what these might do to how they play/perform on the field or court or in the pool,” wrote USC sports psychologist John Callaghan in an email. “I cannot recall to my knowledge any great athlete depending on such to produce an elite performance.”
Thompson, though, doesn’t see a reason why there wouldn’t be an impact. 
He prefers to use the word “folk beliefs,” instead of superstitions because of the connotation, one that he says might hinder a person’s perception of the impact it truly has. 
“Calling it folk belief helps remove that idea that it’s necessarily false. It’s not necessarily false,” he said. “Maybe having a little salt in your shoes is a really good thing. I don’t know.”
Many of the superstitions athletes have rely on building self-confidence. Having a certain folk belief could make a difference in an athlete’s performance, according to Thompson, however, evidence is fairly limited on the subject.
Don’t tell your favorite athlete though. It might become their new go-to superstition.

When 51 women take the Miss America stage Dec. 15, only one can take home the crown. But two may be familiar faces for Trojans: Miss California Catherine Liang and Miss Hawaii Lauren Teruya are both Class of 2021 USC graduates. 
Miss America began as a swimsuit competition in 1921, but has since evolved beyond a beauty pageant. Now, participants are judged on their speaking skills, social platform and onstage talent. The winner receives a $100,000 scholarship for higher education. 
The crux of the Miss America competition is that each contestant must have a social justice platform. As Miss California and Miss Hawaii respectively, Liang and Teruya are already working on implementing their social platforms in their home states, with the hope of going national by winning Miss America. 
Liang, who graduated with a degree in international relations and global business, chose the cause Champions of Courage to promote emotional intelligence workshops at schools and nonprofits.
“I am a big believer that … we face all of our own individual forms of fear, but it really is our reaction to it that defines either if we are someone who is defeated by it, or someone who comes out a champion,” Liang said. 
Teruya, who graduated with a degree in journalism and theatre, is promoting Arts for All, which advocates for increased arts funding in schools. Teruya hosts community art workshops for children, encourages donations to teachers and  works with Hawaii’s Department of Education to develop her own version of hopscotch influenced by pop culture. 
This competition cycle is the first in a few years for Liang and Teruya. Liang took a break from pageantry after being diagnosed with Hashimoto’s disease, an autoimmune disorder, and losing her home in a wildfire. 
“I felt like a complete newcomer, like I’m stepping back out of pageant retirement,” Liang said. 
Before this competition season, Liang’s last title was Miss Los Angeles Chinatown in 2018.
Teruya first stepped into the pageantry world alongside her sister, Kathryn, who won Miss Hawaii in 2017. Kathryn said the pair did not grow up around pageantry, but it was a natural fit because of their love of performance. 
“Once I got into it … I think [Lauren] saw the growth that I was able to have,to not only public speaking, but also the opportunity for service, and she kind of jumped on board with that too,” Kathryn said. 
After Teruya’s tenure as Miss Teen Hawaii Teen USA, which she finished during her freshman year at USC, she was uncertain as to whether or not she would return to the competition circuit. Yet, Kathryn, along with Kira Dixon, Miss America 2015 and former classmate at the Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism, inspired her to keep going.
“I wasn’t really sure that this was the world for me. But when I saw the amount of dedication [Kathryn] had to put toward community, to service, to her impact, I wanted to take the time to do the same,” Teruya said.
Both women are surrounded by people working to help them reach their full potential inside and out of the competition. For Liang, that’s her self-described “Southern California momager,” Felita Wong Shen, who met Liang while Liang was the president of the Delta Phi Kappa sorority at USC and Wong Shen was the president of the sorority’s alumni association. 
“It just made sense for me to be the person that was helping connect her to people and bring her to events and appearances,” Wong Shen said. 
For Teruya, that person is Amos Kotomori, a local designer who mentors girls in pageantry during his free time. 
“I’m basically the person that connects the dots,” Kotomori said. “I have resources that I can call on to help and assist with different things.” 
The Miss America competition has a long cultural history. Russ Gladden, CEO of the Miss California organization, described growing up watching the Miss America pageant on TV. 
“[It] was a big family event, not unlike what the Super Bowl is today,” Gladden said. 
But in recent years, the excitement around the competition has cooled off. The #MeToo movement set off a series of scandals in the Miss America organization, beginning with then-CEO Sam Haskell resigning after his misogynistic emails, in which he derided past Miss Americas, were exposed.
“We are no longer a pageant; we are a competition,” the newly-appointed Miss America board chair Gretchen Carlson wrote in a statement after the email scandal. Carlson was ousted in 2019 after allegations that she created a toxic work environment, but the sentiment remained. 
“I think pageants have really shifted,” Teruya said. “We honestly call them competitions now. We steer away from the word pageant, because it is more so about female role models and female leaders.”
In an effort to modernize the pageant in the wake of the internal turmoil, Miss America ditched the swimsuit portion of the competition in 2018. Television viewership of the pageant fell to an all-time low after the swimsuit competition was eliminated, prompting a switch to streaming in 2021. Frank Rexach, Liang’s career mentor, said Liang “embodies” modern pageantry. 
“From what I understand [pageantry] to be, [it’s] much more around 360 of a person and more about the academic side and professional side rather than the beauty side,” Rexach said. “It’s a different day, time and place now, but I think someone like Catherine goes well beyond the platform of Miss America. She’s just been made stronger because of it, but it doesn’t define who she is.” 
Competing in and winning Miss America isn’t just about holding a title. Both women and their teams emphasized the skills and opportunities that the competition creates. 
“[Catherine is] really taking the opportunity of being Miss California and this platform to continue to advance her ambitions, which is really smart because she’s smart,” Rexach said. 
Kotomori echoed a similar sentiment, saying the pageant is an opportunity for women to further their goals. 
“I listen to really what their intention is, what their definition of winning is,” Kotomori said. “I look at their life ambition, where they are [now] and how I can help them get there.”
To both Teruya and Liang, competing in Miss America represents the culmination of years of pageantry. 
“It’s about time I hang up the pads,” Liang said. “I really want to take this year and everything that I learned in terms of leadership, the ability to be an ambassador and a public speaker, and apply it to [my] career.”

Budding filmmaker Julian Barahona’s latest project is a resonant letter to his childhood self. In 2008, Barahona and his mother were unhoused; now, he’s drawing on this experience to tell the story of “A Trip to the Moon.” 
Barahona, a freshman majoring in film and television production, spent his senior year of high school producing a short film that recently received the honor of Best Drama at the All American High School Film Festival. 
Growing up, Barahona’s main interests weren’t at all creative. Though he enjoyed movies, he spent his early years more enamored with the sciences.  
“In elementary school, I was more focused on science and quantum physics at that time because I was like, ‘Well, that’s a crazy thing,’” Barahona said. “But then, at my core, I always liked movies.”
When the coronavirus pandemic hit during his sophomore year of high school, Barahona, like many, was forced to spend time at home, where he spent his days writing. 
He spent time working on multiple scripts and projects, all while having “A Trip to the Moon” in the back of his mind. The story of “A Trip to the Moon” is a deeply personal one, and for this reason, he was hesitant to tell it. 
After the Great Recession, Barahona and his mother were forced to sleep in their car, which reflects a key theme in the short film of the importance of imagination and wonder. It was his mother that encouraged him to write the story. 
“My mom was like, ‘How about let’s just write it, you know?’ And so that night, I wrote on a piece of paper, just the outline,” Barahona said. “I kind of figured out the structure of it.” 
The next summer, he had a finished script and set out to make the story come to life. Over the course of two days, Barahona and his crew filmed the project. It was the first time he had worked with a professional crew or on a project of this magnitude, and although he was overwhelmed at first, by the second day, he had settled in with the help of a dream. 
“I went to sleep and I had all these images of the day happening, and I was moving and I heard this voice saying, ‘It’s okay just go with the process. Go with the flow.’” Barahona said. “I was able to direct and just be in the moment.”  
This sense of peace and mindfulness stayed with Barahona throughout the shoot as he raced against the clock. 
“Everything was just kind of unfolding unto itself, like a flower,”  Barahona said. “I felt like I was in the zone and I was communicating with everyone, making sure everyone’s good. Everyone was safe doing their thing.” 
Months after submitting the project, graduating high school and starting his first semester of college, it was time for the Teen Indies — the All American High School Film Festival’s Oscars-esque award show. 
The moment arrived where Barahona and his team would find out if their hard work had paid off — and he was in a restroom on campus. 
“I opened the [livestream] and, because it was many hours, I’m popping in every now and then,” Barahona said. “And the moment I go in, I see ‘Best Drama’ and I’m like ‘Oh my god.’ They do the nominees and then I hear my name, and I’m at USC, in L.A., in a bathroom. Like, that’s so silly.”
Chloe Rankin, a freshman majoring in film and television production, described her friend and his work as “whimsical.” 
“[Barahona] is a ball of wonder. I think he is his own little planet that is amazing and is admirable, and I love it,” Rankin said. “It feels really comforting to have someone with so much talent and so much perspective in your corner.”  
Sir William Cornwell III, another of Barahona’s friends and a freshman majoring in acting, further emphasized the unique perspective Barahona incorporates into his work.   
“I think he is one of the most creative people I’ve ever met,” Cornwell said. “And after seeing his work, I understand him a lot more, not just as a creative but as a person, and the way he thinks is so beautiful too.”
In the future, Barahona intends to explore other areas in the filmmaking arena and hopes to continue telling stories with something to abstract from them. Anyone interested in viewing “A Trip to the Moon” can find it on YouTube. 
“I hope that throughout my career, I’d love to be able to do things so that people can see that there’s more, you know,” Barahona said. “There’s more stories, there’s more backgrounds.”

On a chilly evening in October, Liberty in North Korea USC club members gathered for a screening of the film “To the Lights.” The story followed a daughter’s struggle with the decision of whether to stay with her father, who remained loyal to North Korea, or leave and pursue freedom. After the screening, there was a short Q&A with director Emily Kim, a USC alumna who was formerly involved with the club. Members were privy to one of the first screenings, which left some teary-eyed at the end, making the experience all the more special. 
Liberty in North Korea is an international non-governmental organization based in Seoul and Long Beach, California. The organization liberates North Korean citizens and gives them the opportunities and resources they need to thrive outside of the country. 
The organization aids refugees’ treacherous 3,000-mile escape into Northern China and down through Southeast Asia, where they are eventually able to file for asylum in South Korea. Since 2009, LINK has helped liberate 1,310 refugees from North Korea’s oppressive regime. 
LINK advocates and operates with the help of its university chapters around the country, including LINK USC. LINK also fundraises and educates the public about issues pertaining to North Korean refugees and the Korean peninsula through their university chapters network. The USC chapter is made up of three branches: advocacy, fundraising and social. 
The various events the chapter hosts have been integral to building community for LINK USC members. Whether it is visits from guest speakers, film showings or Korean barbeque retreats, the organization’s approach to fostering community helps to engage their community and students on campus, said Sarah Kim, a senior studying law, history and culture and East Asian languages and cultures. 
Minjee Park, vice president of advocacy at LINK USC, said the organization this past year has focused on advocacy much more than before. LINK USC holds a speaker event every semester and on Oct. 26, the club invited three North Korean refugees to talk about their experiences and share their life stories.
“I think we’ve put more of an emphasis on advocacy this year than before…​So the event that we had last Wednesday was our speaker event, where we invited three North Korean refugees to talk about their experiences, and our past advocacy events have been of a similar nature …​So yeah, we do like a lot of we try to bring a lot of different perspectives and different types of events every semester,” Park said.
“For the fundraising branch, we focus on raising money for LINK HQ. It goes towards several different initiatives by LINK; pre-COVID, it went towards refugee escapes, and now the money also goes towards resettlement and education initiatives, like educational opportunities for North Korean refugees who are interested in going abroad,” said Sydney Tsai, vice president of fundraising and a junior studying law, history and culture. 
LINK USC not only strives to support Korean refugees, but the student community comprising the organization as well. The club emphasizes community because of its small size, and stresses to both new members and general members that the social health of the organization is a priority, when before it was only fundraising and advocacy.
The chapter system can be hard and limit the things the campus group can do. Chapter president Sarah Kim emphasized how it has fostered a sense of community and allowed the chapter to grow closer. 
“It is difficult to be a cog in the machine. We are one chapter under LINK headquarters and they obviously have bigger fish to fry,”  Kim said “As far as us being a college chapter, our capabilities are limited. We try to emphasize community by linking up with UCLA or other chapters, but most of our community efforts are targeted towards the USC group.” 
LINK USC recently collaborated with the LINK UCLA chapter to co-host its speaker events. The two chapters’ collaboration has helped to foster a greater sense of community between the two schools. 
“I think that sometimes a lack of structural support can feel a bit discouraging or frustrating, but I think it also gives us the opportunity to shape the club to what we want it to be, and it gives us more freedom to take initiative and achieve what we want with our various events,” Tsai said. 
LINK USC hopes to continue to expand with collaborations, and reach new students at USC in the future, Tsai said. 
“I think that we’re trying really hard to grow our community and have a larger general member body, and we are also working really hard to try to expand our horizons and work with other organizations so that we can put out our message more,” Tsai said.

“We are still here,” said Alondra Mariano, a freshman majoring in pharmaceutical sciences and Native American studies, when asked if there was one thing she wanted the USC community to know about Indigenous students. 
The University Park campus sits on the traditional, ancestral and unceded territory of the Gabrielino-Tongva people. As part of the overall goal of Native American Heritage Month to acknowledge and highlight the history of Indigenous people of the United States, USC Student Affairs hosted a variety of events, from spotlighting the true history of Thanksgiving to gathering Indigenous students for bonding activities. 
The Daily Trojan sat down with Indigenous students at USC to discuss their personal significance of native languages in their lives, as well as their experiences at USC. 
Mariano said that her Indigenous language, Diné Bizaad, also referred to as Navajo, is an important cornerstone of her identity.
“I would say my Navajo language and culture is sacred to me,” she said. “It represents who we are as Navajo people through songs, prayers and whatnot. I utilize our teachings and culture and language and apply them to my everyday life.” 
She said that despite being proficient in Diné Bizaad herself, she was aware that not many people in her generation speak their native languages — yet recognized efforts to keep them from becoming extinct. 
“It is something to worry about, knowing that not many people from my generation speak my language and other Native languages,”  Mariano said. “[But] many of our Elders are still trying to keep our native language and traditions alive by having it spoken through radio stations and in school.”
In 2019, Ethnologue reported that “of the 115 Indigenous languages spoken in the U.S. today, two are healthy, 34 are in danger, and 79 will go extinct within a generation without serious intervention. In other words, 99% of the Native American languages spoken today are in danger.” These statistics highlight the issues Indigenous communities face today when it comes to keeping their language alive. 
Jair Peltier is a doctoral student studying political science and international relations. He is from the bear clan of the Anishinaabe people, and the Turtle Mountain Band of Chippewa (North Dakota) is his home. Peltier said that the extinction of Native languages is due to the U.S. government’s persecution of Indigenous peoples and the schools Indigenous children were forced into. 
“The U.S. government was always interested in the colonial project, [and] was always interested in the destruction of Indigenous people. Assimilation was always on their mind.  Originally, it was [to] kill as many [Indigenous people] as you can. Then, they tried starving us out—and then that didn’t work … ultimately they settled on assimilation policy,” Peltier said.
Peltier and Mariano both mentioned a popular quote that was used to justify the abuses in these boarding schools. U.S Army Lieutenant Richard Henry Pratt, a prominent figure in the late 19th century, is credited with saying, “Kill the Indian in him and save the man.” 
Peltier said that Indigenous children experienced abuse and identity erasure in these schools. Students received beatings if they spoke their native language and were forced to wear western style clothing. 
“Even after the federal government stopped kidnapping children and forcing them to go to boarding school, you still had parents sending their children to boarding school because it was a better opportunity, right?” Peltier said.
Peltier wasn’t always a lifelong speaker of Anishinaabemowin. He originally couldn’t speak more than a few sentences until he attended college and began studying it. He longed to learn the language, and even today, he has mixed emotions when speaking. 
“You feel like you’ve just been deprived of something for so long and you want it back, but the thing is, the spirit never forgets,” Peltier said.  “Native people, we’re really drawn to learning our languages because their spirit is calling out for it. Sometimes, just putting on Anishinaabe, people talking, just having a conversation can just make you feel so sad, but also happy.”
USC does not offer any Indigenous language courses. When asked if they should, Mariano was in full support of the idea, saying it would help to teach Indigenous students their languages. 
“I would really encourage that,” Mariano said. “Because part of history is taken away from us and many people of my generation don’t know the language, so it would be really nice for us, and for those who don’t know their native language to learn it.”
Kai Cayetano, a senior majoring in narrative studies, is currently spearheading a project to bring more language diversity to USC. They are Garifuna, an Afro-Indigenous population from the Carribean island of St. Vincent. 
Recently, they sent out a Google form to demonstrate to the University that there is sufficient interest to create classes for more languages. Part of this project would entail expanding USC languages offered to include Indigenous languages. They’ve already started getting replies and can pursue the next steps once they get more student input. 
“Many students are saying that they want Tamil, they want Swahili and things like that,”  Cayetano said.  “So now that I have what the students want, I can go directly to admin and say, ‘These are the languages people would like to see,’ [and ask] ‘how can we offer them at USC?’”
Options at USC are non-existent for students at USC wishing to learn Indigneous languages, with student organizations serving as one of the few resources for Indigenous students at USC to make themselves known. 
“The Native American Student Assembly has been very helpful because it reminds me that there’s Natives here at USC and that there’s actually other people here who have similar experiences,” Peltier said. “I really think these young people coming up are really the future… They’re really going to do something amazing, something very transformative.”

The Daily Trojan is committed toward having an equitable and inclusive newsroom. Since Fall 2020, the Daily Trojan staff has completed a semesterly survey to assess the demographics and identities of the student journalists that represent the University. Compiling this information will identify which groups make up the majority of our newsroom, which groups are not included in our staff and how we can make sure that everyone is working together toward a safe, inclusive and diverse space.
Methodology
Compared to past surveys that mainly comprised of class standing, race/ethnicity, gender identity, sexuality, student status and record of disability, this semester’s survey expanded to include number of semesters on staff, financial aid status and other jobs outside of the newsroom. Sections had “prefer not to state” options should individuals feel uncomfortable to share.
Previous surveys fell short in capturing staff data related to socioeconomic status, which primarily consists of education, job occupation and income. While difficult to gauge in a self-reported survey, we added options for certain ranges on financial aid packages as well as current occupational experience to identify socioeconomic status. We also added a new question inquiring staff of the number of semesters they have worked for the newspaper to assess staff retention as an indicator of the inclusivity and safety of the environment that would motivate staff of all backgrounds to return and join.
For previous questions, we added more options to provide deeper insight into our understanding of the demographics in the newsroom and how these experiences influence our reporting. For gender identity, we added an option for agender. For student status, we added options for traditional applicant, commuting, legacy and those receiving University scholarships.
The Daily Trojan received a 86.69% response rate, receiving 280 responses out of a staff of 323. Of the 13 sections, the Fall 2022 masthead, copy, opinion and video were the only sections to achieve a 100% response rate. 
Analysis
Individuals who identify as Native/Alaska Native/Indigenous and Pacific Islander make up the smallest percentage of the staff with 0.4% and 0.7%, respectively. The staff saw an increase in white people from 37% in Spring 2022 to 39.3% in Fall 2022, representing the majority of staff. East Asian people represented the second-highest majority of staff and decreased to 25.7% from last semester’s 28.4%.
Black, Middle Eastern or North African and Southeast Asian people both saw increases from last semester. Black people make up 8.6% compared to 5.3%; Middle Eastern or North African represented 5.4% from 4.5%; and Southeast Asian comprise 9.3% of staff, an increase from 4.9%. The South Asian and Latinx/Hispanic percentage makeup are consistent from last semester.
Cis women and cis men respectively represent 58.2% and 36.4% of staff, with 1.8% of staff identifying as nonbinary and 0.7% identifying as gender nonconforming. Excluding cis men, this semester sees a decrease in all the aforementioned gender identities from Spring 2022. Our staff includes one trans man and one agendered individual.
People identifying as heterosexual represent a 69.1% majority of staff, similar to last semester’s percentage of 66.3%. Bisexual individuals make up the second-most represented sexual orientation, with 12.1% of staff — an increase from 10.7% in last semester. 5% of staff identifies as queer, 3.9% identifies as gay and 2.1% identifies as lesbian. Three individuals are currently questioning their sexuality, two individuals identify as asexual and two individuals identify as pansexual. 
In terms of class standing, our staff largely comprises of undergraduate students, with sophomores and juniors accounting for about half of the staff. About half of the Fall 2022 staff is new, while people in their second or third semester in Daily Trojan comprise 16.8% each.
Spring admits, transfer, first-generation, low-income students and students receiving need-based financial aid represent similar percentages from the previous semester. With the new addition of the options “traditional applicant,” “legacy,” “commuting” and “receiving University scholarship,” we are able to identify that traditional applicants represent a slight majority of staff. Legacy and commuting students make up 5% and 3.2%, respectively. 
A substantial 32.9% of staff receive University scholarships. The majority of staff receives University financial aid, with the highest reported package being at most $20,000 for the academic year, whereas 39.3% of staff do not receive any financial aid. Outside of the newsroom, 59.3% of staff currently work another job, which includes paid or unpaid internships and federal work study.
The majority of staff is non-disabled, with 15.4% of staff reporting having a disability or a record of having one.
Moving forward
We at the Daily Trojan recognize the accessibility issues rooted in socioeconomic barriers and lack of racial/ethnic diversity that impede student journalists from actively participating in the accurate and representative reporting of the University. The Daily Trojan newsroom is intended to be both a physical place and a safe environment where diversity of experiences, thought and backgrounds are to be exchanged and amplified, and this stems from who we have representing the many voices of the University.
We recognize that there may be certain aspects of people’s identity that we fail to capture in our survey. Within this report, we continue to strive to be mindful and maintain humility in widening the questions and options we ask our staff, as we want to invite and prioritize a plethora of experiences. 
Currently, the Daily Trojan recruitment efforts rely on social media and the University’s semesterly Involvement Fair. A future initiative we aim to execute is to liaise with cultural affinity groups and the spaces in which there are underrepresented communities of people who are not included in our staff. Meeting people where they are will encourage action participation from people of all backgrounds and improve staff diversity, and thus, our reporting.
Future Diversity & Inclusion directors should take active roles during story and pitch development in mandatory meetings to ensure conscious reporting remains constant from inception to production. The D&I directors must also collaborate closely with the copy team in continually updating the style guide to incorporate inclusive and sensitive language to respect the people we cover.
Recruitment for Daily Trojan does not factor these identifiers during decision-making, but it is imperative for our staff to interrogate our current processes and any implicit biases that result in a lack of ethnic/racial and experiential diversity on our staff.

A few months ago, the creator of “Yu-Gi-Oh!” (a trading card game, animated series and video game series —think Pokèmon) Kazuki Takahashi died trying to save a couple of swimmers caught in a riptide. When I read the headlines, my first thought was, “holy shit the creator of ‘Yu-Gi-Oh!’ just died.” But after letting the news sink deeper into my consciousness, I realized I was mourning not for the death of Takahashi, nor my lack of engagement with the series in recent years, but for the early era of my life that defined my childhood. For me, “Yu-Gi-Oh!” was Saturday mornings lounging on the sofa watching teenagers save the world by believing in friendship and colorful cards. It was waking up early on Christmas, racing to the tree and opening boxes to add to my collection of cards. It was hours of sitting cross-legged on a reddish-orange rug in my room with my brother arguing about the rules of the game. It was late nights spent staring at the screen of my light-blue Nintendo DSi. It was my childhood.
Years had gone by since I had last even thought about the series, but somehow I found myself depressed and teary-eyed. My mind began to collect the nostalgic memories that I had long buried in the corner of the fish tank that is my brain. 
Of the melancholic collections I racked up, my memories with my family in China were what turned my moist eyes into a steady stream of salty liquid. I used to travel to Shanghai nearly every year to visit my extended family when I was younger, but visits slowly became less and less frequent as my parents and I got busier. For some reason, I always thought everything would be fine — that I would be able to go back and visit and everything would be just as it was. However, I learned the hard way that time is unforgiving.
Last semester, amidst the busy few weeks before finals, I found out over a call that my great-grandmother had died. My parents assumed I would be too busy and didn’t tell me until almost a week after so as not to interrupt my studies. I had no idea how to react. Without even realizing it, my mind kicked into the first step of grief: denial. I felt numb and it wasn’t until a week later that the sadness hit me. There would be no more visits to my great-grandmother, no games of mahjong played over an old, square table covered in white linen, no more catching up over banana and red bean paste spring rolls. I was depressed but also anxious about time passing — anxious about losing others I love in my life.
How do I not let these thoughts cripple me and subject me to retreating to the false security that is solely composed of a mattress, some pillows and blankets?
I couldn’t let this dread rule over me forever. Pushing these thoughts to the back of my mind and attempting to just forget was not an option either. My fear and stress were genuine, but I didn’t want to wallow in sadness and pity.
It was at the epitome of my contemplation and depression that I thought of “Yu-Gi-Oh!” Well, my mind wasn’t exactly on the cartoon-y trading card game, but rather on other memories I had watching the shows and playing the games with my brother. Thinking about the game made me remember the token quote of Yugi Mutou, protagonist of “Yu-Gi-Oh! Duel Monsters.” Whenever he and his friends were backed into a corner, he would always say, “always believe in the heart of the cards.” In other words, never give up. The cheesy quote made me laugh and broke me out of my cycle of moping. I realized that life was too short to be sad all the time, and I knew my great-grandmother would have never wanted me to waste away in bed.
I had to live my life proudly, knowing I was loved and cared for by such amazing people and that they still watch over me. It sounds simplistic and even cliche, but I had to realize that I was only that scared and sad because I had the fortune to have such great experiences.
When I read the news of Takahashi’s death a few months later, I was reminded of my great-grandmother again. My initial reaction was thinking that another piece of my childhood was gone, but then I remembered all over again how fortunate I am. Time goes on and things change, but loved ones and good memories will always be with me. My mindset had already changed from wanting to curl up into a ball and cry every time I see something that reminds me of my lost childhood to knowing how loved I am and of all the people that have helped me get to where I am and become who I am.
So now you know that if you ever see me smiling to myself, slightly teary-eyed, there’s a good chance I’m staring at a cardboard rectangle with a colorful dragon on it. If I’m not smiling, I’m probably staring at Blackboard.

Welcome, darling to “Being a Friend 101: The Chronic Illness Crash Course.” Here we’ll tackle some of the basics of how to be a friend to someone who has a chronic illness or disability. 
I’ll save the socio-historical answers for another time because I’d much rather do this a-lá 2008 Tiger Beat tween magazine style, peppermint mocha in hand, bean bag under my booty, sharing the scoop from the source — my friends. So, grab your Starbucks and snuggle up because baby it’s cold outside.
Module 1: Take Their Lead —Listen and Believe
Rule number one is take their lead. If your friend feels vulnerable enough to share, take the advice of my ride-or-die high school bestie, Britta: “The most important thing is to listen because there’s going to be a lot that you don’t understand … there may be cognitive dissonance … “Wait, my friend is so young … how could this be happening?’” For the longest time I would report symptoms to my friends that didn’t make any sense to me, like I don’t fucking know why my veins are making a honeycomb pattern on my ankle! But having the space to be confused and frustrated with them, laugh about it, and be believed made me feel much less alone.
Module 2: Lessons in Patience
 I like to joke that chronic illness should be called chronic patience because the amount of patience you need when you’re waiting for diagnoses for months, even years, is equivalent to the fortitude of a thousand Carrie Bradshaw’s trying to exercise restraint while window shopping. My majestic marathoning best friend Morgan and artistic beam of sunshine Lindsey got it right — patience is the name of the game for everyone involved, and “progress isn’t linear.” Even if you are confused by the daily rollercoaster of symptoms, it’s so important to “still reach out now and then to let them know that you care about them, that you’re thinking about them.” 
Module 3: These Are a Few of our Favorite Things
Arguably the best medicine on the planet is good company, and it’s no different with a friend who has a chronic illness or disability. When I FaceTime with my best friends I want to hear about their lives because I am so exhausted by mine. Just because I am so sick I need a shower chair doesn’t mean I suddenly want to stop hearing about how my best friend is falling in love, or how my other friend’s ex is trying to log into her Instagram or drool over season 2 of Outer Banks. Morgan put it best: “Try to cultivate a safe and comfortable space where your friend can relax and be themselves, enjoy the things you’ve always enjoyed together.”
Module 4: Communication
As a friend to someone with chronic illness, it’s easy to feel helpless and overwhelmed. It’s also normal to feel like your relationship with that person is changing, or has to evolve and adapt. Lindsey observed that people living with chronic illness are often “strong people, so if you need to share with them that you feel overwhelmed definitely do that. Do it in a kind way. Their condition is not their fault… respect them enough to be honest… [because] you both need to communicate your needs, you both need to have patience and compassion for one another.” 
Module 5: Take Initiative 
Living with a chronic illness and disability is exhausting. I have pushed myself past my physical limits in order to participate in something with new friends. Yes, I might even stay silent about my disability in fear of being left out. If I do choose to disclose my disability, when friends take initiative to accommodate my wellbeing, like traveling to me or suggesting adapting our plans, it makes me feel supported and loved.
Another way to take initiative is to research your friend’s condition which can mean the world. Britta echoed this, sharing “I want to get your perspective, and I want to show you that I’m interested in your treatment and how this is progressing and how you’re feeling. Are you excited about this next move, or are you nervous or are you hopeful?” Asking a question about my condition, or sharing something you saw on social media about chronic illness is a great way to show you care. 
Module 6: Put On Your Oxygen Mask First
As my health journey deepened and intensified, I had to be reminded that friendship is reciprocal. Morgan noted that to “make sure you’re being the best friend you can, you need to take care of yourself.” This is perhaps the most important lesson you’ll learn as a friend to someone with chronic illness or disability — sometimes setting healthy boundaries is the best way you can continuously show up for those you love. 
Takeaways
When I first became ill, I feared I’d lose friends. I thought my friends might not want to weather the storm with me, and they did drift away, and I learned the hard way about something called “compassion fatigue.”  But the friends who endure the storm are the most precious people in my life because they proved my fear to be unfounded.
Being friends with someone who has a chronic illness or disability oftentimes takes adapting, which can be a slow process and feel daunting, but that doesn’t mean those with chronic illnesses and disabilities aren’t incredible friends. If you don’t have a friend with chronic illness, maybe you have a friend or family member who lives with depression, anxiety, is grieving or is deeply lonely. I hope these lessons and my friends’ honest responses remind you of the importance of kindness to others and compassionate inclusion of all.

Hilarious, heartwarming and empowering. These are all words that not only flood the review sections of bestselling author Sonali Dev’s Bollywood-infused contemporary romance novels, but speak to her glowing character off the page. 
Never witnessing female protagonists growing up prompted Dev to write her own. Whether it be fresh takes on classic Jane Austen novels, or innovative, page-turning Indian family dramedies, Dev’s passion for her craft mirrors her literary mission — proving that writing romance has the power to change culture and reimagine South Asian representation like never before. 
Dev’s ninth novel, “The Vibrant Years,” is the first to be published under Mindy’s Book Studio, a boutique story studio powered by multi-hyphenate Mindy Kaling and Amazon Publishing that celebrates and supports emerging and established diverse voices from page-to-screen.
 “There are so many talented women who are writing smart, juicy, funny stories, and I’m so excited that through Mindy’s Book Studio, I can help bring readers everywhere more books that reflect the diversity of our society,” said Kaling in a press statement. 
“The Vibrant Years” trails the lives of three generations of unconventional and ambitious Indian American women as they embark on a journey of shared self discovery, and live their lives, vibrantly.  
Dev spoke with the Daily Trojan ahead of her upcoming release about what this milestone means to her and the origin of her endless love for storytelling that blossoms from cover-to-cover. 
The following interview is edited for brevity and clarity. 
Daily Trojan:  Thank you so much for being here and speaking with me. I wanted to start off by talking about your childhood. Tell me about where your love for writing stemmed from. 
Sonali Dev: I was aware of inequities very early in life. My grandmother went to med school in colonial India, and was one of the first lady doctors back then. So being told that you could be anything actually meant something to me. I was actually seeing that. All of the lies culture told us repeatedly about what we had to do to be good girls, meant something to society but really didn’t mean anything to me. I had a very observant childhood because of this. My parents used to always say, “It’s amazing the things you remember.” That was one of the blessings I had. I saw. I saw where people were being unreasonable, or when things didn’t make sense to me. I think my need to write originates from my need to say things and to change the ideas people have about the things being said.
DT: I know Jane Austen has been a huge influence in your writing, what was it about her work specifically that fascinated you? 
SD: I read her in middle school for the first time. Women were at the center and when they were, they desired things. They had enough self worth to expect to get those things. And, the main thing was that they actually got those things. There aren’t many stories out there with female protagonists. Lizzie Bennet was a character whose choice was destitution or marrying allegedly the eighth richest man in England. And when she met him he was, from her perspective, a complete jerk. She believed she was worth more. Despite having a choice between destitution or complete luxury, she said ‘no thank you’ because I deserve better than you. She wasn’t punished for her self-worth. Austen’s characters demanded respect and got it. This was something I wasn’t seeing in film, books, anywhere. When everyone around me believed women were better off silent, Elizabeth Bennet was loved for vocalizing who she was. She made it okay for me to be me. 
DT: It just goes to show how powerful literature is for being that mirror to show you possibilities you couldn’t imagine. Why do you feel like it’s important to have representation in the media? 
SD: As an immigrant from India, I was the norm. I didn’t have the experience of being othered in my home until I was equipped with the tools to deal with it. I grew up seeing myself in the media all of the time. My children, on the other hand, did not have that same experience. They did not have a single childrens book with an Indian American protagonist. And, you’re their age so I imagine you felt the same. I got to see my children deal with the pain of being othered before they knew they needed support. Knowing that I’ll never be able to internalize their experiences really informed the kind of parent I became. I brought an armorless thing into a world in which it would need armor. I knew, when I was starting to take my writing seriously and fighting to be published, I wanted the bookstore to be a space where the next generation knows they exist. Representation is the experience of seeing yourself at the center of stories. Which makes you realize that you can be the center of your own universe, too. 
DT: You mentioned the early difficulties of being published. Talking to you it’s clear you deserve a space on every bookshelf, but for many underrepresented authors, this is sadly not the easiest process. What were some of those challenges you faced?
SD: When I started trying to sell my first book, nobody really cared to have me in any space. Publishing was overwhelmingly white. There were a lot of authors of color who had been doing this work for a very long time. But we were in a place where every time you took your story to someone, you were told ‘‘If people wanted to read books about Indian protagonists, there would be books about Indian protagonists.’ If publishing wanted something different, someone would’ve asked for it by now.’ And when we asked for it, we were told there was no space because it was all good. A lot of really good authors have been lost. It takes one muscle to write stories and another muscle to survive being told nobody wants to read your stories. The truth is, non-white cultures are full of fun, joy, celebration and escape. It’s more than a culture lesson. It has taken the work of a lot of people before I came on the scene.
DT: I come from a multigenerational home, and it’s so fun to experience similar interactions on the page. When Mindy Kaling’s Book Studio greenlights this witty and fun family adventure, I just want to know what your reaction was like. Tell me about the day you got the news and what her support meant to you. 
SD: I have for decades now really admired the way Mindy does comedy and humor. She has changed the world for diverse creators and storytellers in media. I also really really enjoy her writing whether it is “The Office,”  or “Late Night” (2019) or “The Sex Lives of College Girls.” You know, there is just a way in which she does humor and emotion rolled up together in this vulnerable space where characters can completely find themselves in painful yet hilarious situations. So when my editor called me, I had absolutely no idea what to expect. She said we need to set up a meeting for Monday. I was like, “Are you kidding me? I have to wait the whole weekend for this?” She said “Trust me, this is big. You’ll forgive me once you know what it is.” And, Mindy it was. Probably one of the only moments in my life where I was speechless for an entire phone call. I was so excited. Mindy’s team is incredibly professional, which does not surprise me at all. But the sense I had of being in really good hands and of being able to breathe because I felt so taken care of, that’s a completely new experience and it’s fabulous. I feel really well held up. That’s priceless in my eyes. 
Dev’s latest release, “The Vibrant Years,” is out now digitally through the Amazon First Reads program. It will be available at bookstores nationwide on Dec. 1. It is currently available for preorder on Amazon.

As finals season approaches and winter break tags along behind it, we are all desperately seeking at least one approximately one-hour-57-minute escape.

Whether you’re a fan of holiday movies or absolutely detest them, streaming services have got you covered with tons of brand new TV shows and movies to take the edge off this final-filled holiday season. 
HBO Max
“A Hollywood Christmas” – Dec. 1
From actor-turned-writer John Ducey comes an all new holiday romantic-comedy; the only twist is that it’s set on… well, the set of the protagonist’s own movie! In this enemies-to-lovers speedrun, Jessica (Jessika Van) — a budding filmmaker — meets Christopher (Josh Swickard) — a super cute network executive — who, unfortunately, threatens the production of her new movie. This movie combines beloved tropes into one big Hollywood love story, which makes it a must-see holiday spectacular for all you classic trope lovers out there!
“Gossip Girl Season 2” – Dec. 1 
Calling all “Gossip Girl” fans, new and old! After receiving mixed reviews on season one of this classic TV show’s reboot, the second season of the new “Gossip Girl” is reported to feel like the beloved original show fans yearned for. Having worked on the original “Gossip Girl,” returning executive producer Josh Safran stated that he “always knew that if [they] got to a season two, the characters themselves, now that they have been manipulated by Gossip Girl for a full season, would start to play into Gossip Girl’s hand. That would be the place for [them] to go back to doing that stuff that the first show did so well.” For all “Gossip Girl” fans, this new season will surely have you hooked… maybe even more hooked than you would be on the Gossip Girl website!
Disney+
“Pentatonix: Around the World for the Holidays” – Dec. 2
If you’re looking for a more documentary-style holiday movie, this one’s for you! Join multi-award-winning music group Pentatonix as they struggle to complete their annual holiday album.

Hulu
“The Binge 2: It’s A Wonderful Binge” – Dec. 9 
As a special treat for “Stranger Things” fans, this movie stars the actor of your favorite Surfer Boy Pizza delivery man, Argyle (Eduardo Franco)! If you liked “The Purge” (2013), you’ll love this hilarious spoof on it even more! This holiday-themed sequel to the 2020 movie, “The Binge,” is yet again set in a world where drinking and doing drugs is illegal except for the night of the annual Binge. Follow along as each of the now adult characters try to navigate normal life when The Binge is moved to Christmas Eve of all nights. The hysterical predecessor to this sequel is only one hour and 38 minutes long, so you have plenty of time to binge it before the new movie drops Dec. 9. 
Netflix
“Guillermo del Toro’s Pinocchio” – Dec. 9
Although this movie isn’t exactly holiday related, “Guillermo del Toro’s Pinocchio” will surely bring back a good dose of nostalgia for all. Starring Gregory Mann, Ewan McGregor and Ron Perlman, the movie boasts a strong lead cast and even features a few other well-known stars, such as “Stranger Things,” actor Finn Wolfhard and multi-Academy Award-winner Cate Blanchett. Toro’s rendition of ”Pinocchio” follows a father who wants his young wooden boy to be human. It’s his second Netflix release of the year, following a decidedly less holiday friendly entry,  “Guillermo del Toro’s Cabinet of Curiosities” (as recommended in our October streaming guide). So, this rendition of Pinocchio is definitely one you’ll want to check out!
“Roald Dahl’s Matilda: The Musical” – Dec. 25
Having already gone viral on TikTok for the scene with the “red beret girl,” Roald Dahl’s “Matilda: The Musical” is a highly anticipated film this December. Joining back together with Dennis Kelly, Tim Minchin composes the beautiful rendition of the music he originally wrote for the Broadway version. This movie follows a story-witted, intelligent girl who is determined to stand firm against her superiors. With its killer choreography, beautiful vocals and outstanding composition, this is a movie-musical Broadway fans of all ages won’t want to miss.
And last but certainly not least, don’t forget to tune in to the Pac-12 Championship Game to watch our very own Caleb Williams and fellow Trojans take on other top Pac teams around the country Dec. 2 on FOX!

Three days before I moved into McCarthy Honors College, I tweeted on my K-pop stan account that I would be “taking an indefinite hiatus [from running my account] to focus on my uni studies.” It was a move partly for that reason, but moreso because at that point in time, I knew that the last thing I wanted to be associated with in college was K-pop. 
So it’s ironic that almost three and a half years later, I’m sitting outside at a table in the Tutor Campus Center writing the final installment of my K-pop music column for the University newspaper. It’s bittersweet to wrap up this column after a year of writing it, and to wrap up my experience at the Daily Trojan after seven semesters working here. 
If you’ve had even one conversation with me, you probably know that I like K-pop — I think I scream about my favorite idol, Stray Kids’ Lee Know, to someone at least once a day. 
But it wasn’t always like that. 
K-pop is just one of those things that people don’t really talk about — maybe it’s the fact that the most privileged person in American society is a white man, or maybe it’s the idea of the American music market being the gold standard that rendered listening to music from other countries completely irrelevant. 
I was lucky to grow up in Honolulu, Hawaii, a state with a large Asian American population, and attend a high school where liking K-pop was accepted, if not the norm. It was easy for me to talk about my love for Jungkook with my friends at school who either also listened to K-pop or at least knew what it was. 
Yet coming into college, I made the executive decision to conceal this aspect of my identity in shaping the version of myself I’d be at USC. I remember thinking that my peers would think it was weird and cringey to like K-pop, and that the only way that I’d be accepted at USC was if I hid this part of myself away. 
But my time at USC has been one filled with change and emotion and an overarching theme of self-growth. My freshman year was spent hiding — not just hiding my love for K-pop music but also hiding away from opportunities and situations that would push me out of my comfort zone and toward new experiences without safety nets of friends. I spent my sophomore year back home, where I watched and listened to more K-pop than ever before in coronavirus quarantine, and made it a mission of mine to prioritize spending time doing things I genuinely enjoyed. With that goal in mind, I came back to USC as an upperclassman ready to make the most of my time on this campus in the most genuine way possible. 
It was at this point in my college career, in which I found some of my best friends and spent my time working on things I truly loved so much, that I decided to begin this column — when I made the conscious decision to take a part of myself that I used to deliberately tuck away and shout about how much I loved it on the highest figurative rooftop in existence. It’s almost symbolic to think about the way I interacted with myself as a K-pop fan in relation to the way I interacted with myself as a USC student. 
This is all very metaphorical and philosophical for me to be writing about in an arts and entertainment column about Korean pop music, but I suppose what I’m trying to say is that this column really meant so much more to me than just that. Of course I loved plugging Stray Kids in the Daily Trojan every other week, and of course I loved analyzing trends in the K-pop industry, but moreso, I loved having a space in which I could be open and honest about something I sincerely enjoyed so much. I loved finally feeling like I was being my genuine self, and that I would be loved and appreciated on this campus because of it. 
Since the inception of this column, I enrolled in the University’s first-ever course dedicated to studying K-pop and dedicated an entire journalism class project to creating a newsletter about K-pop. I now talk shamelessly about my interests — K-pop or otherwise — and each of the facets of my identity without fear. I’ve logged back into my K-pop stan account. 
So, whether you read this column because you genuinely like K-pop, because you avidly read every article the Daily Trojan publishes or because you’re my friend, I thank you for giving me this space. As I depart from my role as Fall 2022 editor-in-chief and say goodbye to my column and to the Daily Trojan, I’ll take from it a newfound understanding of what it means to be true to myself. I hope you will too.

This summer, I was browsing the AMC website to see what movies were playing. I missed going to the movie theater, only having gone maybe thrice at my rural high school, and I was excited to munch on popcorn and see my favorite ad starring Nicole Kidman.
One poster I kept skipping over was for “Mrs. Harris Goes to Paris” (2022), a baby pink one with Mary Poppins-like figures floating. It looked like a bad movie for kids; the title seemed like it told the whole story and to say the least, I was uninterested.
But while in the middle of summer school browsing on Vogue, I saw an interview with Isabelle Huppert about the film and its political subtext. Of course, as a fashion fiend, I immediately clicked and was surprised to learn the movie was about a widowed cleaning lady in Britain who decided to save money to buy herself a couture dress from Maison Christian Dior.
So, I bought a ticket for a late-night screening with my dad and entered the theater with no expectations. To say I loved the movie with all my heart and soul would be a wild understatement.
I had a lump in my throat four times, shed tears twice and giggled uncontrollably. The movie was about so much more than the enjoyment of vacationing to Paris and splurging on a dress; it commented on social class, economic and political tension, the tropes of mean wives to corrupt husbands and models who wants to be more than a pretty face, the pursuit of passion and, of course, the truest, purest and most traditional form of haute couture.
It also spoke on being a kind person. Especially growing up in Asia where I was taught to respect those older than me, I was also taught by my teachers throughout middle school and my community in high school to always be kind — not just nice, but deeply and truly kind, just like Ana de Armas’s pure honesty in “Knives Out” (2019).
But the scenes where Mrs. Harris sees Dior gowns, accompanied by the widening camera zoom-outs, felt incredibly intimate, and I must admit, one of the scenes where I shed some tears was when she finally got to wear her finished couture gown.
To see the intense love for the dress and the way it made her feel also made me pity myself, as I realized I hadn’t ever had that moment in my life. Yes, I’ve felt moments of utter joy and internal reassurance of fate, such as when I found ‘70s printed Prada pants in my size at over 70% discount, but not like Mrs. Harris. I have not felt like I was the shining light in the universe and the most beautiful girl to have ever walked the earth.
It made me re-appreciate the care and dedication of the seamstresses in Maison’s and when I went home, I immediately returned to Alexa Chung’s YouTube series when she went behind the scenes of Dior’s Maison in Paris and rewatched “Dior and I” (2014), the documentary on Raf Simon’s first collection there as creative director with Pieter Mulier.
However, what made me most sad about the film was that I knew it was never going to be appreciated the way it should be. It will never be as iconic and nostalgic as “13 Going On 30” (2004) or “The Devil Wears Prada” (2006), but instead will remain underappreciated and hidden from the world of fashion lovers.
Maybe it was the marketing, as I had never even seen an ad or trailer for it, or maybe the Coronavirus killed their campaign plans, but even when asking my fashion community, I have yet to meet another person who has watched it.
So, I began to think, why not? What makes this movie so different from Andy Sachs or Jenna Rink? Well firstly, Mrs. Harris is not a New York “it girl” on the rise getting ready to jet set into a life of Miu Miu and Balenciaga. Secondly, she doesn’t have endless resources or parties for networking. Instead, she takes the bus with her friend, mends clothes at the pub with her slow-burn crush, Archie (Jason Isaacs), and drinks a cup of tea with a photo of her late husband at night. Thirdly, Mrs. Harris sets out on her adventure on a whim and on luck alone; she sees signs under her late husband, Eddy’s spirit through the lottery, dog racing and late widower payments from the military. 
While Sachs’s struggle is being an outsider in the fashion world and her internal struggle with pre-Runway Andy, Mrs. Harris tackles snobby Parisians, an ultimately disappointing man and learning to stand up for herself after being too kind again and again.
Still, while I loved how deeply personal the movie felt, it’s disappointing knowing that I won’t see edits all over TikTok and Mrs. Harris will never become a sexy, cheesy Halloween costume. I still wish I could gush about the movie with friends over brunch and a weekend of thrifting.
But maybe that was one of the lessons I was supposed to learn: to savor what I have and have experienced regardless of if others can indulge as well. The fact that you, dear reader, may not have watched it shouldn’t be a reason to not bring it up at all.
Regardless, I also believe that my deep love for this movie comes from my desire to see a new film about fashion that had the depth, feeling and roundness of a documentary, without bringing me down by reminding of the harsh reality of fashion or painting an unrealistic world of perfect endings. The movie felt like a bedtime story I could paint with my six-year-old imagination — full of new color and completely pursuable. 
And it delivered — it truly was a completely different fashion film. Instead of being about ogling dresses and daydreaming of attending Met Balls, it was the story of a journey to a dress and the growth of a person represented by a materialized identity.
So, for that, I thank that Vogue article, Mrs. Harris and all her adventures for coming into my life.
To anyone needing a break during finals and who wants to both laugh and cry over a beautiful story, I highly recommend this film. Officially giving it six out of five stars, I sign off on my last article of the semester.

There’s nothing quite like seeing a half-naked man crouched on stage eating raw meat in front of a bunch of TVs stacked on top of each other playing news clips from some of the most contentious recent events. That was the scene that fans of The 1975 were greeted with on Monday when they showed up to a sold-out show at the Kia Forum. 
Band members Matty Healy, Adam Hann, Ross MacDonald and George Daniel played for nearly two and a half hours, with the set list spanning from fan-favorite tracks to underrated gems. Their tour is titled “The 1975: At Their Very Best,” and after seeing the almost clinical precision with which they pulled off a very long but very clean set, it seems like a no-brainer to agree with their own bold tagline.
The energy in the Forum was unmatched, as the arena slowly filled up until it was packed with fans before the curtain dropped on The 1975.
Up-and-coming indie hip-hop-rock band Blackstarkids opened the night, which was an interesting choice, as their music did not really match The 1975’s vibe. Calling it “Disney Channel flow” — as Jake Paul does on “It’s Everyday Bro” — would probably be a bit mean, but there’s really no other way to describe it. Their music tries to draw upon nostalgia for the early 2000s, with tracks like “JIMMY NEUTRON” and “FRANKIE MUNIZ.” However, their efforts fell flat as their music ends up coming out generic and derivative. Their vibrant on-stage presence almost made up for the disappointing songs, but when the whole point of a concert is to listen to music you like, the match-up between Blackstarkids and The 1975 felt forced and nearly unfair to Blackstarkids, as it was obvious the crowd was not matching their energy.
However, as they walked off stage, the vibe in the Forum keyed up to a higher level when a bright blue curtain unfurled from the ceiling and “The 1975” was projected on it in massive letters. Time ticked by slowly until around 8:45, when the lights dimmed and the curtain dropped, revealing the band’s elaborate set. A modern house complete with two levels, a small roof and a staircase, it looked almost as if someone had cut a house in half and revealed the inside like a massive, stage-sized cake. Lamps and TVs littered the stage, and the light they emitted went on to play a big role in the set design. It was a truly stunning set to see live, as it was full of details and played perfectly into the two-part design of the show.
The first part of the show focused on their latest album, “Being Funny In a Foreign Language.” They began with the album’s first track, “The 1975,” and the second the music kicked in, the crowd went wild. They played nine out of the 11 songs on “Being Funny,” all the while Healy played up the character of the drunken singer, stumbling around the stage and nearly falling off the set at times. At first, it was tell to see if he was being truthful about his intoxicated state, as he kept taking sips from a silver flask he carried with him, and his small asides in between songs were slurred and nearly unintelligible at times. However, the passion and clarity with which he sang killed any belief in the character of the drunken fool. 
After all, you can act like a pretentious jerk all you want, but when your entire reason for being is music, you can’t help but let that shine through.
The band’s inventive set design helped create a dynamic and engaging atmosphere. For example, during “Fallingforyou” in the first half of the show, all the other lights on the stage went out, while the faux street light lit up, bathing Healy in a melancholy yellow softness that reflected the way he plaintively sang looking straight up at the light. 
For nearly half the show, Healy didn’t face the audience. He was either facing the cameras that broadcasted him to the two massive screens on either side of the stage, or he was crawling around and falling down all over the stage.
They ended the first half with the last song off “Being Funny,” “When We Are Together.” The entire Forum sang along as Healy strummed away on an acoustic guitar. It was one of those moments that fills you with the warm fuzzies, feeling everyone around you connect even if you’ve never met before and you’ll never meet again.
The band then left the stage, and before the second half of the show began, a surprise guest knocked on the house door. Everyone held their breath in anticipation, expecting Healy again, but then the whole place burst into raucous screams and applause when lo and behold, out walked Phoebe Bridgers. She played one song, a cover of “Milk,” a very early The 1975 track, before she left without even speaking to the crowd. Still, her appearance was a beautiful surprise.
The second half of the show was better than the first. Healy was more present, dropping most of the drunken act and instead adopting an equal parts endearing and irritating, passionate yet pretentious personality. Although, maybe that’s just his personality. 
He dropped in asides about liberal masculinity and Kanye West amidst mega-hits like “It’s Not Living (If It’s Not With You),” “Robbers” and “Somebody Else.” The crowd was swept up in ecstasy as they moved from song to song, and it felt like it would never end as the group just kept playing and playing and playing. 
However, all good things come to an end, and as the clock on stage above the fake front door neared 11 p.m., they played their last song, “Give Yourself A Try,” a perhaps pointed reminder from Healy to his fans. As someone who has tried to shove off the responsibility of role model and simply consider himself some type of postmodern (ostensibly his favorite word, like he says on “The 1975:” “We’re experiencin’ life through the postmodern lens / Oh, call it like it is”) philosopher, he still made an impact on everyone in the crowd with his enthusiasm and small moments of a genuine nature shining through.

Men’s water polo heads to Berkeley this weekend for the NCAA championship tournament and a shot at the program’s 11th national title. After going undefeated last weekend and securing a Mountain Pacific Sports Federation championship, USC enters the NCAA tournament as the No. 3 seed. 
Last weekend, the Trojans dominated at Uytengsu Aquatic Center, beating UCLA and Stanford in the semifinal and final games. USC was never behind the entire weekend, and their wins secured the Trojans a spot in their 18th consecutive NCAA tournament. 
“Last weekend, we really proved what we can do as a team,” said freshman utility Andrej Grgurevic. “I feel like we have [real] potential this year to do something great.” 
This was USC’s 12th MPSF championship, but their first with Head Coach Marko Pintaric and their first since 2017. After scoring 9 goals over the weekend, redshirt senior 2-meter Jake Ehrhardt was named the 2022 MPSF Men’s water polo tournament MVP. Ehrhardt is now No. 7 in all-time career goals, with USC men’s water polo and totals 51 goals for this season alone. 
But Erhardt isn’t the only Trojan to make the 2022 MPSF All-Tournament Team. Redshirt senior driver Ashworth Molthen, graduate student driver Massimo Di Martire and graduate student goalie Kyle McKenney all secured All-Tournament honors. 
Last weekend was the fourth time the Trojans faced crosstown rival UCLA this season. After three nail-biting contests that ended in defeat, USC finally pulled out a win. After the Trojans dominated the first three quarters, UCLA attempted a comeback from behind – something the Trojans are all too familiar with after previous games they’ve played this season against the Bruins. However, USC held their own, and with game-changing saves by McKenney, they took their first win over the Bruins this season. 
There’s a good chance USC will match up against UCLA again this weekend, but this fact has not affected the Trojans’ confidence in their success. When asked how confident he felt that this team could take home a title, senior driver Marcus Longton simply said, “100 percent confident.” 
“I think that our team has seen the most improvement out of every team in the conference so far this year,” Longton said. “I think we’re the closest we’ve ever been and I think we’re ready, and we’re all so excited.” 
The first matchup of the weekend is against Princeton, who is 27-5 overall this season and coming off a 13-game winning streak. The Tigers have broken their own school record of wins this season by one game, and despite coming in as the underdog, the Tigers have something to prove. 
“It’s going to be really tough, probably the hardest tournament and the hardest three games of the year,”  Grgurevic said. 
This is Grgurevic’s first NCAA tournament, and the uncertainty is equally as exciting as it is daunting. His strategy aligns closely with what the Trojans have been doing all season: “leave everything in the tank.” 
“It’s the last three games of the season,” Grgurevic said. “As long as… you gave it your [all], played the best you can, you can be happy going away with it.” 
Longton’s mindset as a veteran of the tournament is a bit more refined — and, as a senior, more nostalgic as well. 
“[The] strategy is to take it one step at a time, one game at a time, one quarter at a time,” said Longton. “Live in the moment and control what we can control.” 
In his final year as a Trojan, Longton’s hopes for the tournament are to take home a long-awaited title.
“This will be my last couple games suiting up with USC,” Longton said. “Obviously it’s incredibly emotional, that goes for all the seniors, and I know there’s only one perfect way to cap off our season and that’s with a national championship.” 
USC enters their final showdowns of the season with an 18-6 record overall, and an undefeated record at home. The Trojans will face Princeton Thursday at 5:00 p.m. at Spieker Aquatic Complex in Berkeley, and if they can secure a win against the Tigers, they will take on UCLA for the last time this season in the semifinal match Saturday at 4:00 p.m.

While early December marks finals season for USC students, it also means the postseason for some Trojans — or the beginning of the season for others. Although these games will probably be as stressful as assignments, projects and studying, here are some of the top USC games to watch over finals.
Men’s Water Polo
The No. 3 men’s water polo team secured their 18th consecutive bid to the NCAA tournament by beating Stanford in the 2022 Mountain Pacific Sports Federation Tournament championship game. The Trojans will take on Princeton in the quarterfinals Thursday in Berkeley, California.
Redshirt senior Jake Ehrhardt was named MPSF Tournament MVP after scoring 9 goals in their tournament run. If the Trojans beat Princeton Thursday, they will face crosstown rivals UCLA in the semifinals. These foes played against each other in the MPSF Tournament, with USC getting the best of the Bruins 12-11. Follow USC’s NCAA championship run as they take on Princeton Thursday at 5 p.m., streaming on the NCAA website.
Women’s Volleyball 
The women’s volleyball team was selected for an at-large bid in the 2022 NCAA Tournament. They were awarded the sixth seed in the Texas region of the bracket. The Trojans will take on High Point, the Big South champion, at Covelli Center in Columbus, Ohio, Friday.
Look out for senior outside hitter Skylar Fields as she looks to continue her impressive performance into the postseason. Fields, a transfer from Texas, led the Pac-12 in kills and points while achieving all conference honors in the Pac-12. Watch Fields and the Trojans Friday at 2 p.m. on ESPN+ as they look to capture their 4th NCAA title in program history.
Football
“Win and they’re in” is the chatter around campus and sports networks alike. The No. 4 Trojans team will take on No. 11 Utah in a crucial rematch for the Pac-12 championship game at Allegiant Stadium in Las Vegas. If the Trojans win, they will cement their status as one of the top four teams in the College Football Playoff rankings, securing them a spot to fight for a national title.
The odds-on favorite for the Heisman, sophomore quarterback Caleb Williams, has been on a tear this season. Williams has thrown for 3,712 yards and rushed for 351 yards. His 44 total touchdowns are the most in USC football history. 
One thing to watch out for is senior tight end Dalton Kincaid for the Utes, who has 16 receptions for 234 yards and a touchdown earlier this year against the Trojans. Catch this clash in Vegas Friday at 5 p.m. on FOX.
Men’s Basketball
The men’s basketball team takes on the Cal State Fullerton Titans at home on the first day of finals. The Trojans have had an up-and-down start to the season, starting 4-3. After a shocking upset at home against Head Coach Andy Enfield’s former team, Florida Gulf Coast, the Trojans won their next four games. However, they have lost their last two games to two respectable teams, No. 13 Tennessee and Wisconsin. 
Senior guard Boogie Ellis has gotten a scorching start to the young season, averaging a team-high 18 points per game while shooting 45.9% from the three point line. Whether you’re studying for finals or just finished the hardest exam of your life, come out to Galen Center to support the Trojans Wednesday, Dec. 7 at 8 p.m.
Women’s Basketball 
The women’s basketball team is off to its best start since the 2018-19 season. The Trojans have won their first six games thanks to having one of the best defenses in women’s college basketball. They rank fifth in the nation in points per game, while keeping opponents to just 21.1% from the 3-point-line — 12th in the nation. 
Sophomore guard Rayah Marshall leads the Trojans in blocks and rebounds at 3.5 and 9.8 respectively. Marshall is third in the nation in blocks.
The No. 15 UCLA Bruins travel to Galen Center to take on the undefeated Trojans on Thursday, Dec. 15th at 7 p.m. What better way to end finals than watching a rivalry game at Galen Center?

Every college football team starts the season with hopes to make it to early December, when only those with a berth to their respective conference championship, or Army and Navy, grace the gridiron. Last year, USC played on the first weekend of December, but it certainly wasn’t for a Pac-12 title. Instead, the Trojans were losing to Cal in a rescheduled game that stamped USC’s worst season since 1991.
Thanks to an influx of talent coming from the hiring of Head Coach Lincoln Riley and an unprecedented wave of transfers, this year’s early December matchup is a different story. 
USC will look to hit the jackpot in Las Vegas Friday when they take on the University of Utah in a rematch of the Trojans’ only loss this season. With a win, USC will earn not only its 40th conference championship, but also a spot in the College Football Playoff for the first time in program history.
“It’s a championship game, you’re going to play a good team regardless. I don’t think we would be any more or less excited if it was anybody else,” Riley said. “This is not a revenge game … This is a new game, a new challenge, a new setting.”
Utah was the first real heat check for a USC team that had faced just three teams with records now above .500. While the offense exploded for 42 points and over 424 yards, USC’s defense was tested by a strong Utah rushing attack and senior tight end Dalton Kincaid, who burned the Trojan secondary for 234 yards and a touchdown. Junior quarterback Cameron Rising ran for a two-point conversion to take the Utes’ first lead of the game en route to a 43-42 loss for the Trojans.
“Any time someone has a career game against you, there’s a little bit of embarrassment about it,” said Grinch on Kincaid’s monster game against the Trojans. “If [Rising] makes big time throws and [Kincaid] makes big time catches and we don’t tackle him, we know exactly what’s going to happen: the same damn thing … It’s all hands on deck with an opponent like this and one that we have a lot of respect for.”
Containing Kincaid is certainly a focus for Grinch and his linebacker unit that seems to always be recovering from injuries. However, with sophomore linebacker Eric Gentry back on the field, USC’s defense is vastly improved. 
“He’s been one of those guys that collectively over the course of the year has made some plays and made an impact for us,” Grinch said. “His best football is still in front of him and we’re certainly excited about [Gentry].”  
On the offensive end, sophomore quarterback Caleb Williams has continued to impress college football pundits, and is now the heavy favorite to win the Heisman trophy. With 44 total touchdowns and just 3 interceptions on the season, Williams has been the key to each USC victory. 
“One of the things that we did was block out the noise and that’s what I’ve been doing,” said Williams on the Heisman hype that has built up as his season has progressed. “We have bigger goals in mind that I’m a part of and that I want to be a part of towards the end of the season.”
The Trojan offense averages over 42 points per game and has faced its fair share of injuries, with junior receiver Jordan Addison and sophomore receiver Mario Williams each missing multiple games and starting running back Travis Dye ending his redshirt senior season early with an ankle injury.
Senior running back Austin Jones has seamlessly stepped up in Dye’s absence, rushing for 348 yards and 2 touchdowns following Dye’s injury against Colorado.
“[Jones] didn’t let it rattle him. He kept working, and trusted there would be an opportunity if he kept his nose to the grindstone and he’s done that,” Riley said. “Like I’ve said many times, nobody around here is surprised about him being ready to step up and play at an elite level like he has since [Dye] went down.”
The Trojans will need all hands on deck for a talented Utah team that handed USC its only loss of the season. USC will take on the Utes Friday at 5 p.m. in Las Vegas.
