A helicopter crashed on the helipad roof of the Los Angeles County-USC Medical Center Friday, the Los Angeles Fire Department reported through a news alert. The pilot has been moved with minor injuries while the two passengers declined any medical treatment and reported no injuries.
The identities and the circumstances of the victims’ injuries have not yet been determined. The LAFD also reported no signs of a fire.
“The aircraft is stable on its side, on the helipad,” the LAFD news alert read. “There does not appear to be a significant fuel leak.”
The helicopter was transporting a donated organ via a private ambulance, LAFD spokeswoman Margaret Stewart told the Daily Trojan. 
The organ was safely transported by LAFD firefighters to USC-County Hospital medical staff.
Norfolk Street between Soto Street and San Pablo Street is closed, with USC Department of Public Safety officials urging community members to avoid the area until further notice. 
This is a breaking news story. It will be updated as the Daily Trojan receives more details.

The Undergraduate Student Government presented a resolution to incorporate a Transfer Student Assembly into the organization during Thursday’s meeting, which was rescheduled due to Election Day on Tuesday. Authored by officials and members of the Transfer Student Community, the resolution hopes to remove the stigmatization some transfer students have faced at USC and provide resources including transfer-specific advisers and opportunities to engage in more academic activities. 
Transfer Student Community co-Presidents Francesco Loiola and Katerina Levandis authored the resolution to support transfer students, who make up around 30% of the undergraduate student body. The resolution is currently supported by USC officials, including Vice President for Student Affairs Winston Crisp and Assistant Vice Provost David Glasgow. 
USG Sens. Dario Arganese and Alexis Areias also sponsored the resolution. Arganese, who transferred to USC from Suffolk University in Fall 2018, spoke about his experience in an interview with the Daily Trojan and the challenges that came with the transition.
“When I got to USC, I saw that there were a lot of initiatives and events that were going towards just freshmen,” Arganese said. “I thought it was even more challenging to meet people as a transfer student than it probably would have been for freshmen because I went from one environment … to a completely different one at USC where it was much more challenging.”
If the resolution passes, the Transfer Student Assembly would go through an incorporation process, which involves a trial from Jan. 15 to March 12. The trial period would also allow the assembly to showcase its various initiatives proposed in the resolution, including enacting policies to accommodate transfer students and promoting events that would make transfer students feel more included. 
However, demonstrating this would be difficult with USC’s likely remote plans for the spring semester, Arganese said.
“It’s definitely gonna be a challenge because in the past, when you do go to a trial period, it’s a lot more opportunity to have those in-person events and to be able to take that footage, take photos, send it in, show exactly the progress that you’re making with all your initiatives but considering we’re online, we definitely foresee it being a little bit more challenging,” Arganese said.
The Native American Student Assembly is the most recent assembly to become a recognized organization under USG after an amendment was passed last semester to allow student organizations with 50 undergraduate student signatures to form an assembly. 
DivestSC, a student-led campaign urging the University to redirect its fossil fuel investments to clean technology and renewables, also introduced “A Resolution in Support of Fossil Fuel Divestment and Reinvestment” at the meeting. 
DivestSC Co-Chairs Nathaniel Hyman and Tianna Shaw-Wakeman said they have further plans to introduce the resolution to other USC organizations such as the Graduate Student Government and the Faculty Senate.
“The goal is to have support from all parts of USC and from everybody who has a stake in this because we all have a stake in it when we’re talking about USC finances and climate,” Shaw-Wakeman said in an interview with the Daily Trojan. 
Hyman also said that he and other members of DivestSC reached out to USG’s advocacy branch to find senators who would be eager to understand the issue of divesting from fossil fuel investments. Sens. Cathy Ding and Areias sponsored the resolution.
USG senators discussed other issues such as urging USC to extend its pass/no pass option deadline to after final exams, particularly considering the stress caused by the online learning environment and the 2020 presidential election. Arganese cited the latest Change.org petition, which had more than 3,500 signatures at time of publication, as an example of student demand for the pass/no pass extension. 
The meeting also passed an resolution to allow a program that distributes free menstrual products at some campus locations once students return. Areias, who contributed to creating the initiative, said menstrual products would be included at five USC locations: Lewis Hall, Steven & Kathryn Sample Hall, the Student Union, Engemann Student Health Center and the Ronald Tutor Campus Center. 
Senators also approved new leadership into the International Student Assembly. Junior  Andy Song and senior Rui Daniel will serve as co-executive directors with junior Natasha Harianto as assistant director.

It’s March 23, 2019. A senior at Moorpark High School, Drake London holds the ball in his left hand, staring down the hoop from beyond the 3-point line at the Battle of the Valley Dunk Contest. 
Soon, London’s in the paint. He rises. In the next fraction of a second, he and his green jersey are a blur: “0” on the back, “Moorpark” on the front, 0 again, Moorpark. His back to the hoop, London throws down the 540-degree dunk with two hands.
The clip goes viral. If it wasn’t already, Drake London is now a well-known name on the California high school basketball scene, almost a year out from his Trojan debut at Galen Center.
But back in March, Drake London had already committed to USC. 
For football. 
“I’ve had a lot of people tell me that I can’t do it,” London said of playing two sports in college. “That fueled me. I love when doubters try to tell me no.”
Eight months later to the day, London caught eight passes for 142 yards and a touchdown as a freshman wide receiver for the Trojans — in front of a crowd of over 64,000 at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum in a victory over UCLA — as if football is the only sport he’s ever known.
The inevitable spotlight that results from his two-sport status is one London has carried long before college. 
London comes from the relatively small Southern California town of Moorpark — population 36,830, with one high school in town. Walking down the street, everybody knew London’s name. Crowds came to watch him play. 
Dwan London, Drake’s father, said the attention had its pros and cons. 
“There’s 50% of the town who really, really love us and love our family, and they’re really, really behind us,” Dwan said. “And there’s 50% of the town who’s kind of tired of hearing the name Drake London.”
But according to Ryan Huisenga, Drake’s football coach at Moorpark, from that spotlight grew a kid who knew how to tune out the noise.
Huisenga said London was always the first one ready for practice and the last to leave; a competitor from route-running race drills to the Friday night lights; a leader by example. Huisenga credited Dwan, Drake’s mother Cindi, his sister Makayla and his friend group for never letting the limelight inflate Drake’s ego. 
Huisenga recalled a time toward the end of London’s junior year when London was invited to an NBA Players Association Top 100 camp in Virginia for elite high school prospects, and he had to miss some school. Moorpark’s principal met with London’s teachers to discuss his academic workload, and his teachers were caught off guard upon hearing the extent of London’s athletic achievements.
They knew he was a good athlete, Huisenga said, but they had no idea just how good.
“If you didn’t know who he was, you would just pass by the guy and just go, ‘Oh, that’s a really tall kid,’” Huisenga said.
It’s an attitude that London maintains under the Coliseum lights. 
“He drives home after ’SC games and hangs out with his boys from Moorpark sometimes,” said Ryan Moore, London’s basketball coach at Moorpark in his senior year. “And there’s times when like, man, I’d be at the 9-0 right now going wild back in the day if I were him.”
It’s not because London doesn’t care; in fact, it’s quite the opposite. His coaches lauded his competitiveness, and his parents said they’ve seen his passion from a young age: when he couldn’t wait to start moving around and walking as a baby, when he said in a first-grade parent-teacher conference his passion was football or when he convinced his parents to let him play tackle football in fifth grade instead of the original plan to start in sixth. 
Dwan joked that he and Cindi have focused on Drake’s load management since around eighth grade, limiting him to one sport at a time. Originally, London and his parents agreed that come senior year, he had to pick one. 
That didn’t work out. 
“I thought I was going to be a football player for the longest time until I grew about eight inches in high school,” Drake said. “Times change. So here I am.”
London’s commitment to playing two sports, and his refusal to drop one in favor of the other, is a large part of how he ended up at USC. 
Moore said he sat down with London early in the recruiting process, when London wasn’t necessarily tied to playing both sports. But the high schooler told him that if USC gave him the opportunity to play both, he’d wind up in cardinal and gold. 
The offers came, but more so for football. (Moore doesn’t think London got his dues in the basketball realm.) But USC gave him the chance to play both, and the rest is history. 
“Walking into my parents’ room and my dad watching Reggie and just seeing the Coli light up, I was fascinated,” London said, recalling a picture on a USC Athletics Twitter post of his 10-year-old self in a No. 10 Trojan jersey. “I just thought I would carry on the tradition of being an ’SC fan. It was a dream of mine.”
Playing two sports at London’s level is no easy task, even in high school. Still, Moore said London’s transitions between football and basketball seasons were seamless mentally and that he adjusted quickly physically. 
After the Moorpark football team would finish its Thursday walkthroughs, Moore said, London would head to basketball practice to watch the last half hour, and he’d sit with the team on the bench for weekend fall games.
London’s priorities have never wavered, then or now. Whatever sport he’s in, London said, it’s tunnel vision.
“Drake is probably one of the most loyal, hard-working kids that I know, and I’m not saying that just because I’m his mom,” Cindi said. “He’s not about the spotlight, he’s a team player. He wants to do what’s best for his team. And whether that’s a football team, a basketball team, his group of friends — he’ll do whatever he can to make sure everybody is in the best position.”
That loyalty and work ethic have helped turn London into one of USC’s most popular breakout picks this season. Though he doesn’t crave it, the spotlight is likely coming his way again.
But judging from how his parents, his coaches and London himself speak, it’s unlikely to affect him. The way he carries himself, he’s just a regular person — one who still visits his high school basketball team to talk to them about tuning out the outside noise, one who likes fitting his 6-foot-5 frame under the Londons’ kitchen table to jump out and scare his mom, one who dropped off infant-sized USC apparel for Moore after he had his first child in August 2019.
“People don’t expect people of Drake’s athletic ability and of his stature and of his potential … to be such a thoughtful person, to think about other people as much as he does,” Moore said. “It’s just unbelievable who he is as a person.”
And as for those doubters London mentioned? At this point, it’s possible none remain. 
But if they do, they’re only adding fuel to Drake London’s ever-burning fire.

USC football finally returns tomorrow. The Pac-12 is back, and more importantly for Trojan fans, USC will begin another season filled with either glory or disappointment.
The Trojans are capable of finishing this shortened season undefeated — there, I said it — but many factors will come into play. Let’s take a look at what makes this upcoming season so potentially prosperous for USC, along with some players to look out for. 
Here are some predictions of the players, coaches and games likely to make a difference — for better or for worse — beginning tomorrow.
Team MVP
There is no doubt who should be the Trojans’ Most Valuable Player this season: Sophomore quarterback Kedon Slovis had a fantastic freshman year under odd circumstances and only figures to improve in 2020. 
The 6-foot-2 signal caller from Scottsdale, Ariz. was thrown to the bulls last season after since-transferred quarterback J.T. Daniels suffered a season-ending injury in USC’s first game. Slovis threw an interception, but the Trojans held on for the win. 
The next game, against No. 23 Stanford, Slovis threw for 377 passing yards on 28 of 33 attempts with three touchdowns to lead the Trojans to a comeback victory. 
Slovis mania was underway. 
Three thousand, five hundred two passing yards, 30 touchdowns and an NCAA third-best 71.9% completion percentage later, the former three-star recruit had captured the hearts of USC football fans. 
The accurate and agile quarterback throws a deep ball that can land right in receivers’ palms and has a pocket presence cooler than the other side of the pillow. Another year under his belt with offensive coordinator and quarterbacks coach Graham Harrell in an Air Raid offense, coupled with the return of redshirt junior left tackle Alijah Vera-Tucker to protect Slovis’ blind side and allow him to utilize the myriad weapons at his disposal, means Slovis could take an even greater leap this year.
Not only will he likely be the clear-cut MVP of the Trojans, but Slovis has a shot at being Pac-12 Offensive Player of the Year and even competing for the Heisman, if things go right.
X-Factor
The Trojans’ run game last year was far from consistent. Injuries depleted the running back room, but this year, having all the backs healthy will be a huge addition to the offense. 
Senior Stephen Carr is one of those players looking to have a bounce-back season after battling injuries his junior year and could provide a dynamic option for the Trojans in an offense that isn’t quite as pass-heavy as a typical Air Raid. 
Carr only had 396 yards rushing with five touchdowns last season despite hopes for a larger contribution to the offense. Running backs coach Mike Jinks said Carr came into camp extremely focused on the upcoming season. 
“He looks as good as he’s ever been since I’ve been here,” Jinks said of Carr. “He’s focused and ready to take his game to another level.” 
The quick and shifty 6-foot back often leaves defenders stuck in their cleats with his jump cuts and jukes to evade tacklers — good luck tackling him in the open field. The agile Carr can catch out of the backfield or burst through gaps to move the offense downfield with explosive plays.
A healthy Stephen Carr is a dangerous one for Pac-12 opponents. 
The Trojans potentially establishing an effective run game can present options in the passing game with play-action passes or run-pass option plays. Carr is one of the main factors that will dictate the success of this offense.
Best position group
The Trojans’ receiving corps last season was simply outstanding. 
Then-senior Michael Pittman Jr. led all Trojans in receiving yards with 1,275, receptions with 101 and touchdowns with 11. Still, his departure opens up opportunities for a deep position group returning several elite talents from last year and bringing in some fresh talent as well. 
Two other receivers were right behind Pittman in the receiving yards tally — junior Amon-Ra St. Brown with 1,042 and redshirt senior Tyler Vaughns with 912. 
Alongside St. Brown and Vaughns, sophomore Drake London is yet another option Slovis can look to. In his freshman year, London hauled in 567 receiving yards with five touchdowns. 
All three wideouts have the potential to reach upward of 600 receiving yards in this seven-game season with Slovis under center. Together, the three wideouts on the gridiron are as dangerous as a three-headed snake.
Impressive freshman wide receivers Gary Bryant Jr. and redshirt Bru McCoy are poised to be important contributors to this already stacked receiving group. 
Bryant, a four-star recruit from Centennial High School, shows promise as a Robert Woods-esque receiver who can not only catch the deep ball but also run it if the Trojans look to call some trick plays. McCoy, a five-star recruit from Mater Dei and 2018 MaxPreps National Player of the Year, is a more physical receiver with the ability to pick up plenty of yards after the catch.
They and the aforementioned trio make up the best position group for the Trojans. 
Most impactful coaching hire
Last season, the Trojans were the sixth-best defense in the Pac-12. In 13 games, only twice did they allowed the opposition to score fewer than 20 points. 
Head coach Clay Helton made the decision to hire former Texas defensive coordinator Todd Orlando after parting with longtime coordinator Clancy Pendergast this offseason. In three seasons at Texas, the Longhorns’ defense was top five in the Big 12 in points allowed twice. 
The addition of Orlando to this solid defense, which boasts plenty of talent but hasn’t put the pieces together in recent years, can be extremely impactful for the Trojans. 
Junior safety Talanoa Hufanga highlighted at the beginning of training camp the energy Orlando brings to practice and the team. Cornerbacks sophomore Chris Steele and junior Olaijah Griffin emphasized Orlando has made practices more physical compared to last year, which they believe has benefited the team. 
Orlando can propel the Trojans into a top defensive team in the Pac-12.
Toughest regular season opponent
The Trojans have a relatively easy schedule, facing no ranked opponents. Going undefeated in a six-game regular season is feasible but no easy task.
Anything can happen in football, and any team is susceptible to slipping up in one game. 
Utah poses the biggest threat to the Trojans’ undefeated hopes. The Utes were upset by the Trojans last year in an early-season battle, where senior quarterback Matt Fink started in place of an injured Slovis and threw for three touchdowns.
Utah had the best defense in the Pac-12 last season, allowing the fewest points and yards in the conference. The Utes return their leading tackler, junior linebacker Devin Lloyd, from last year, but have lost key offensive players like running back Zach Moss and quarterback Tyler Huntley to the NFL ranks.
USC has dropped its last three road matchups to its Pac-12 South foe, and the Trojans should not take the Utes lightly, as they have the personnel to steal a win again in Week 3.

USC cornerbacks coach Donte Williams is committed to reasserting USC as the king of college football on the West Coast. A Los Angeles native, Williams understands the positive impact a successful USC team can have on recruiting, locally and nationally. Under his guidance, Williams plans to help the Trojans take back control of the recruiting trail and return to national prominence. Williams spoke with Daily Trojan sports editor David Ramirez about his move from Oregon to Los Angeles, his expectations for the season and his goals as a coach. 
DT: Why did you want to come back to L.A.? Why USC specifically? What about this job attracted you and what do you hope to accomplish?
DW: I mean, there’s a lot of things that happened in my life. My dad’s been extremely sick right now, so that’s huge for me, someone that’s been there for me my entire life. At the same time, USC is one of those particular places where you can be in the national championship year in, year out. You can throw a rock in a 50-mile radius in any direction and you can get enough players to win a national championship. You can go anywhere in the country and pretty much pull the best of the best players. We’re still doing fairly well in recruiting and once everything opens up, we can do a lot better. 
Growing up out here in L.A. basically four or five miles away from campus, I know what ’SC is. I know what it can be — no, what it should be. Leaving Oregon wasn’t really a bad aspect. It was more of what you can do at ’SC and things going on particularly with my family.
DT: Literally speaking, we know what “Take Back the West” means. But what does that mean to you beyond just putting that hashtag on Twitter? What is the significance of the “Take Back the West” mantra?
DW: I can’t speak for everyone, but for me it’s about making sure USC is — we should be in the Rose Bowl every year. That’s how I look at it. We should be top-five recruiting every year. We’re in a conversation to be in the Playoff and the list goes on. When I think of “Take Back the West,” if you’re the best in the West Coast, that should be good enough to be in those conversations. 
DT: What are some little things you’ve learned to take advantage of trying to recruit over Zoom? 
DW: I mean, a lot of things I can’t talk about because, you know. But I really don’t need sleep. Sometimes you got to do long days but it’s by any means necessary and I’m always OK with that. When you can relate to both sides of the spectrum, it changes things up to where you don’t just have to recruit defensive backs. I recruit DBs, quarterbacks, receivers, linemen. Here we’ve done a great job of helping each other recruit. It’s one thing if I can say “I did this” but here it’s definitely “us” and we’re all helping each other and we’re doing a great job together.
DT: What do you see in USC and the potential of its defensive backs that you can turn them into the force that Oregon was the last few years?
DW: I mean it’s one thing for me to talk about it, it’s a whole different thing that we do it on the field Saturday. We’re getting into the habit, right now, I’m making sure we finish the play. The biggest thing is attention to detail. They all were decorated out of high school but high school doesn’t mean anything. I guess these guys are finding that out now because at the same time, some of them I knew, but I didn’t really recruit them. We’re getting a chance to get to know each other and Saturday will be our first real test. We’re going to make sure everybody in the world gets to see what we’re capable of.
DT: So what does proving it on Saturday look like to you? What is a successful performance from the back end of the defense in your opinion?
DW: Basically, no explosive plays. No big plays. Every now and then they’re going to catch the ball. I mean, they’re on scholarship too. They have great players also. Make sure we’re able to tackle, make plays and just make sure we’re out there having fun. Nobody’s having fun when they’re losing. Nobody’s having fun when they’re not making plays. So we’re out there having fun and we’re doing our jobs. 
DT: What would you see as a successful time at USC and what would you see as a successful career coaching in general?
DW: Successful time here: I see all the guys I coached get their degree. That’d be first. The second is to win a national championship, so that’s more of a team goal. The third thing is all these guys that play in these games for us and play at those spots, that they get drafted and make their dreams come true. 
For me, I’m more focused on making sure I’m the best DB coach in the nation. Just like everyone else when the time comes, hopefully I get the opportunity to be a head coach one day and a defensive coordinator and the list goes on. Right now I’m focused on what I can do for these guys to make [them] better and be the best DB coach I can possibly be on a daily basis.
DT: When you were a coach at Oregon, what are things you noticed about USC that you thought, “I would fix that?” What were the first things you thought needed to be taken care of?
DW: The culture. I mean, just making sure everybody is brought in. Coach Helton has done a great job making sure the players, coaches and everyone has bought in to the way he envisions what he would like USC to be. It’s one thing for the players but [there’s] a lot of new coaches here too. We have to also buy in and see the vision which he set for us all.

In the opening game of what could be one of the most unorthodox Pac-12 seasons in the conference’s history, the No. 20 USC Trojans are set to host the Arizona State Sun Devils at 9 a.m. Saturday at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum. After an extended offseason, the teams will look to start their respective campaigns off with a win, all the while adjusting to starting their schedules much later than usual. 
“I’m really happy for our kids and staff,” head coach Clay Helton said Monday in a virtual press conference. “Now, to have the opportunity to play the game we love, we’re just very appreciative and grateful … I’ve got a lot of respect for [head] coach [Herm] Edwards and the job he has done. He’s put together a really good football team.”
Recent history indicates that the game should be an offensive affair, with each of the last 10 meetings between the teams yielding more than 55 points combined. 
USC’s offense will look to expand upon the pass-heavy scheme from the previous season, led by sophomore Kedon Slovis, the nation’s most accurate returning quarterback. Another year of experience will do the unit good, as Slovis will look to limit his turnovers after throwing nine interceptions as a freshman. His primary target will be junior Amon-Ra St. Brown, who amassed over 1,000 yards receiving and six touchdown catches last season, though redshirt senior Tyler Vaughns and sophomore Drake London round out an elite receiving trio. 
“You can’t replace experience,” offensive coordinator and quarterbacks coach Graham Harrell said. “I think where [Slovis] improved the most is getting [more] live reps … We had to make the most of the quarantine. We were able to watch a lot of tape together and get on the same page. I think if the play caller and the quarterback are on the same page and seeing the game the same way, you have an advantage.” 
The defensive side of the ball is where the Trojans will look for improvement from last season. They were 78th in the nation in points allowed per game with 29.4. The run defense will be an area of focus, needing improvement from last season’s unit, which allowed more than 100 yards on the ground in all but two games. 
New defensive coordinator Todd Orlando, who coached at the University of Texas among other schools before taking the job at USC, is optimistic about the unit’s readiness coming out of preseason training.
“We’re all very excited to get going,” Orlando said. “We had a stretch of time [during camp] where we really challenged [the players], and they have done an outstanding job of embracing what we want to try to get accomplished.” 
Having lost its all-time leading rusher Eno Benjamin to the NFL, the Arizona State offense is in need of another playmaker. One replacement could be sophomore Jayden Daniels. The 6-foot-3, 185-pound quarterback has a light frame, aiding his running abilities. In terms of passing, he threw for nearly 3,000 yards in his freshman season, making him an all-around threat on the offensive side of the ball. 
“What’s really neat about this game is that you’re gonna see two of the better quarterbacks in the country right off the bat,” Helton said. “I was extremely impressed with [Daniels] last year. His production was evident both in the passing game and how he creates athletically.” 
Defensively, the Sun Devils were inconsistent last season and are looking to steady the ship. The unit is led by junior linebacker Darien Butler, who was the team’s leading tackler last season as well as the first ever ASU true sophomore team captain. The most notable change on the defensive side of the ball comes in the form of new co-defensive coordinator Marvin Lewis, former Cincinnati Bengals head coach, alongside Antonio Pierce. 
Harrell knows his offensive unit will have to be ready for a challenge, even if Lewis is a few years removed from coaching in the NFL. 
“It makes it difficult. Obviously it’s been a long time since [Lewis] has called a defense,” Harrell said. “I’m sure he was pretty influential in what they were doing at Cincinnati … We don’t necessarily try to out-scheme people. We’re gonna try to go execute what we do at a really high level.”
For the players, it will be a game like no other, with the kickoff time at 9 a.m. and no fans in the stadium. 
“I don’t think any of us have played in an empty stadium in any of our lives,” St. Brown said. “We’re gonna have to count on our team to come up with some juice and some energy … I don’t see all the hype around [the 9 a.m. kickoff]. I can play at any time once I’m up. It’s just an earlier game for me, it’s nothing too crazy.”
With an abbreviated, six-game season, neither team will have much margin for error in terms of contending for a spot in the Pac-12 Championship Game. 
“I talked to our team about pouring ourselves into each and every week,” Helton said. “If you wanna win a championship, you’re gonna have to look at perfection … If you get caught up looking at what’s three, four, five, seven weeks down the road and not focusing on what’s right in front of you, you’re gonna look up and get your butt beat.”

Dear young immigrants: 
We’re going to be OK. 
We are as strong as the can-do mothers who have nurtured us,
Diligent as the fathers who have put forth our way. 
They may grasp for the most beloved of things,
But they can never take our fight. 
For in truth
How can we be anything but resilient?
Those that have sought to quiet our voice and stamp our aspirations beneath their feet,
They have created a hardy breed of people
With tougher skins and louder voices. 
Do not forget: You are the pride of a foregone people. 
With nothing more than fifty dollars and a persistent accent to their names,
Our ancestors rested in small spaces between four, weary walls.
They worked years for what they knew was less than they deserved,
Because they worked for you — what they knew was worth more.
We’re going to be OK. 
The world may seem bleak at times. 
Our once-blue skies have turned fiery red and polluted grey,
But we will still bask in a singular sunny day
Because we have been taught to count small victories. 
The first man on the moon shouted with triumph,
The words we know well.
Likewise, 
Your small victory is a milestone, 
Marking another “something-better” for us all. 
It’s no secret. 
You and I,
We have had a long four years. 
As a rule of thumb, 
We pray for sunshine,
Because we know that I.C.E. is no friend to us. 
We champion our Dreamers,
Because the world can seem, at times, 
A great nightmare for us all. 
They have threatened to barricade themselves behind solid, brick wall, 
And separate themselves from us in high, gleaming towers.
All the while, 
We watch from down below,
Wondering: 
Do they not know we too seek a better America? 
To my fellow immigrants,
I know that you are weary,
But we have come too far to flirt with defeat. 
As of yet,
Where the future may take us hangs formidably in the balance. 
We watch with bated breath as our nation divides itself by primary colors. 
They fill in outlines,
Red or blue. 
These are no longer pigments within crayon boxes,
But symbols of either a continued struggle or a long-awaited reprieve. 
I am young and hold this dear to my heart like many. 
I do not claim to know everything, 
But this I know is true: 
We are strong together, united. 
In our groupings and delineations,
We may seem an insignificant cluster, 
A foreign entity with no place of belonging. 
And yet, in these past 1,500 days, 
I have watched with awe as we have stood in each other’s corners,
Championed one another’s causes. 
In a nation so severely divided,
You and me,
We have been able to see eye-to-eye.
With their words and actions,
Our leaders have implied with every microaggression that unalienable rights do not apply when you yourself are considered “alien.”
We are not convinced. 
We have learned not to fear a simple noun. 
No person, place, or thing has been able to take away our fighting spirit,
And no matter the results,
That will not be the case now. 
When I tell you that we will be OK,
It is because I have faith that we are made of stronger mettle. 
I do not pretend to know what the future holds or who will make decisions on our behalf,
But I know who I am and who you are. 
We are not all the same color, class or creed,
But we have decided to be the hands that hold one another standing. 
We are there for our undocumented brothers and sisters. 
We have lobbied for the lives deemed collateral damage in American wars.
We stand with our fellow hyphenated Americans, when our leaders choose money and politics over decency. 
This is how I know
With certainty
That we will be OK. 
I know your heart is troubled 
And you fear something yet unknown. 
Don’t worry; 
You’re not alone in this.
I feel it, too. 
But we will take it day by day,
Placing one foot in front of the other.
If you will tell me in return,
I will keep reminding you:We’re going to be OK.

This week, it’s hard to think about anything but the election. On Instagram, almost every story focuses on voting and support for Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden. On Twitter, celebrities and friends seem to echo the anxiety of the nation as we await the results. On Facebook, I’m instantly, maybe unfoundedly, suspicious of any political posts, and I’m grateful I haven’t encountered any yet.
It feels like since the 2016 election cycle, social media has been a major player in spreading political news and, more concerningly, influencing political opinions. Our generation, initiated into politics during the Trump era, now has a perspective on how campaigns and administrations operate that is a departure from what our parents experienced. Instead of cable news, we hear about matters of the state first on Twitter and then on talk shows and eventually, we might read about it in the paper. 
We have witnessed President Donald Trump take advantage of his social media presence to further his professional agendas, manipulate media narratives and garner attention. At first glance, Trump’s heavy involvement in and general dependency on social media seem unbefitting of the office he holds. History tells us that a president addresses his people through journalists, press conferences or national broadcasts, not through Twitter. However, by making social media his administration’s primary medium of communication, he provides a forum for political discourse that is more accessible to the average American than it has ever been before. 
The content of his tweets have inspired ridicule, indignation and outrage, but they’ve also inspired unwavering support. They paint him as a man who isn’t afraid to voice his opinion, to launch personal attacks on opposers or even to strain foreign relations. In spite of the inappropriate views he might express, in the end, his actions are viewed as a testament to his unflinching honesty and imply a strong sense of transparency from his administration. 
Unfortunately, many of us have found that the 45th president has an affinity to alter and manipulate facts to his benefit. This trust he builds with his followers is how Trump spreads his own brand of fake news. His tweets, a display of his ability to fabricate events and his taste for hyperbole, become fodder for supporters to share and promote, for his opposition to share and critique and for broadcasting networks to share and improve ratings.
And here, we encounter a problem. In principle, politicians being in touch with the populations they serve sounds ideal. It provides a platform for ordinary citizens to play a larger role in governance and policy-making. But in reality, there is no one to hold you accountable for your words. Whether you tell a blatant lie, give misleading information or provide a biased account of events, we’ve created a culture that marks it up to be a difference in opinion.
We’ve seen that this “difference in opinion” can be extremely influential when expressed by people with power — it isn’t limited to just Trump or conservatives. Now, an important question arises: If the president himself isn’t a reliable source of information, who is?
The answer should be simple: journalists. But like most things in 2020, it’s not so easy.
In a world where we frequently associate politicians with corruption and deceit, journalism should be the unbiased, justice-seeking practice that functions to serve the public. But in the wake of Trump’s most successful social media campaign, “Fake News,” the trust between the media and the public is immensely frayed. Though “Fake News” was used in reference to news organizations like CNN that reported news with a bias against Republicans, it can just as easily be applied to networks that do the opposite.
For loyal Fox News viewers or veteran CNN viewers, the fake news movement is a passing inconvenience, or convenience, that originated from political ambition. For me, it is a constant source of anxiety. 
The news organizations that I’ve quoted in high school reports and cited in college papers, perfectly content with their ability to provide objective truths, are now being accused of the opposite. When I need them the most, to understand the current political environment and educate myself on how policies will affect me, I’m told they are heavily laden with personal bias. 
One part of me understands that it is impossible to be completely objective, especially in the political realm. Abundant criticism or support can be justified based on your personal experiences and views. What works for me might not work for someone else.
However, the other part of me is slowly turning into a conspiracy theorist.
At the end of the day, news organizations are businesses. They’re profit-driven. This pushes them to prioritize work that elicits reactions and lends itself to sensationalism. The market favors outlets with the most viewers instead of those with the highest quality of analysis or information. 
Moreover, the interests of advertisers and shareholders often influence the direction of news stories. Additionally, the majority of news organizations are owned by a small number of conglomerates such as AT&T, Fox and ViacomCBS. This concentration of media power within a few select individuals allows them to have almost absolute control over what and how information is disclosed to the public. 
It is alarming that all my opinions are a product of my environment that is controlled by people I’ve never met. But it is more alarming that we have created a culture where a large proportion of the U.S. youth carries a mistrust of both the administration and the system built to hold it accountable.

During coronavirus lockdowns this summer, two students joined forces to create a nonprofit that donates 100% of its profits to the United Nations International Children’s Emergency Fund to provide N95 masks to health care workers on the front lines of the pandemic.
Referenced in its slogan “mask for mask,” Hidden Beauty sells skin care masks to fund donations of medical masks through UNICEF and has donated $1,000 to UNICEF for coronavirus relief to date. 
USC sophomore Jaclyn Dong and University of California, San Diego senior Jade Lee created Hidden Beauty as part of the 2020 Wongsulting Project, a competition where the two students were placed on a team with the goal of creating a project that helps to solve a root problem of a local business.
Making a positive impact on the world during the coronavirus pandemic was a priority for the duo and also influenced their desire to sell environmentally conscious skin care products, said Dong, who’s majoring in business administration. 
“We’re both interested in skin care … We also wanted to make a positive impact on the world during coronavirus,” Dong said. “So we decided to collaborate and create a brand that was based on eco friendly, organic, cruelty-free skin care products.”
The team collaborates with two wholesalers: Innisfree, which offers biodegradable and naturally-made products, and Made Simple Skin Care, which makes raw, vegan and non-GMO products.
“I kind of wanted to include a third possible cause to our fundraiser, which was the Earth,” said Lee, who’s majoring in economics. “Innisfree is actually not vegan, but it is biodegradable and they use a lot of natural products and ingredients, whereas Made Simple Skin Care was a company I personally reached out to and really wanted to feature on the website because it was a local business … and woman-owned.” 
The brand also prides itself on inner beauty, which refers to the hidden message Lee and Dong believe comes with purchasing a skin care mask that helps prevent a valuable life from contracting the virus. 
Lee and Dong have learned lessons about teamwork that come with running a business, including that the values of honesty and transparency are beneficial to running a business. Through their monthslong work, Dong also said that their separate skill sets — Lee’s experience in technology and accounting and Dong’s in writing and project management — have complemented each other and benefitted the nonprofit. 
Dong and Lee said they have been able to use their experiences in college organizations and young perspectives to their benefit when it came to advertising Hidden Beauty. Remaining active on LinkedIn, Instagram and Facebook, the team has promoted the brand by hosting giveaways of Innisfree and Made Simple skin care masks and encouraging people to share their social media posts. Lee also personally runs the nonprofit’s social media accounts and designs all of the graphics for the brand. 
Jeremiah Jamero, Hidden Beauty’s first customer, discovered the nonprofit after hearing about the project from Lee. After looking into Hidden Beauty, Jamero said he felt inclined to purchase the most expensive item available for sale to support the cause.
“When I saw their cause, helping out UNICEF, donating masks, I thought that was a pretty good cause because when COVID started there was huge news that, for some time, face masks will be a shortage,” Jamero said. 
While Hidden Beauty was started as a temporary business, as it centers around aiding health care workers during the coronavirus pandemic, Lee said she sees the expansion of Hidden Beauty as a future possibility. 
“If people were really passionate about Hidden Beauty and they really like our mission statement, I could definitely see a possibility of [expansion] one day in the future,” Lee said. “Our mission would also have to change a little bit because we would no longer be geared toward specifically the coronavirus pandemic. ”

Students, faculty and alumni tuned into a live Q&A with Oscar-winning director Robert Zemeckis Wednesday as he discussed his most recent film “The Witches” and its peculiar coronavirus-era release.
Zemeckis, a School of Cinematic Arts alumnus, adapted the film from the classic children’s novel of the same name written by Roald Dahl. Though the film faced both critical reception and backlash from the disabled community for its vilified portrayal of limb differences, it has made $4.9 million in the international box office and was recently released on HBO Max. 
There are many challenges to reimagining a story as well known as “The Witches,” the greatest of which, Zemeckis said, was deciding what the witches would look like. He took issue with the use of physical masks to depict the witches’ transformation in the original 1990 film adaptation and sought to take a more technological approach.
“I thought, look, if they’re witches we can transform them using what we will call digital prosthetics and make it look more interesting and use all our modern tools,” Zemeckis said. “Here’s the irony — and this is what I didn’t like about the [original adaptation] — is when the witches take off a mask, the actress puts on a mask and I was thinking OK, we’ve gotta find a better way to do that.”
Aside from the wardrobe, makeup and special effects, casting was also critical to making the fictional witches come to life. 
“It’s brought to life by having a great cast,” Zemeckis said. “The expression I always say to my casting director is I need actors who are working behind their eyes. There’s a lot of actors who perform a line and then you can kind of see them getting ready to do the next line. You just have to feel it.”
He also explains how he uses his hands-off directorial approach to elicit the best performances by stating that he wants the next take to be funnier or sadder and lets the actor run with it. 
“I don’t want to hear where you go to get that, that’s your job,” Zemeckis said. “I don’t want to be in therapy with you.” 
Like many other films, the planned theatrical release for “The Witches” couldn’t happen because of the pandemic. Instead, the film was released on streaming services earlier than originally planned. 
Zemeckis was not heavily involved in the distribution decisions. He said that although he did not know the reasoning behind releasing the film on HBO Max, someone else must have made that choice for a reason. 
Lorenzo Mendoza, a graduate student studying film production, asked Zemeckis how he stays true to his vision in the face of constant feedback. As expected, the acclaimed director gave sage advice. 
“Here’s the only thing that I am able to do to keep my sanity, and that is never take the note at face value,” he said. “Because they’re not the filmmaker. You’re seeing the whole film and they’re reading a scene from the script.”
He explained that he digs deeper into each piece of feedback to extract what is helpful while still taking others’ opinions with a grain of salt. 
“What I do is I say ‘OK, what are they really trying to say?’” he said. “What’s the note under the note?”
Mendoza found comfort in these words, as he can relate to the ceaseless feedback a filmmaker endures. 
“There is so much feedback and so much information coming in for all these different places. Your editor is giving you feedback, your five instructors are giving you feedback,” Mendoza said. “So I was thinking in a larger scale project when you have Robert Zemeckis working on something like ‘[The] Witches,’ I can’t even imagine how many people would be giving you feedback at that level.”
