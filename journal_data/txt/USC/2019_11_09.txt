The black-clad fans at Sun Devil Stadium looked on in horror as USC freshman quarterback Kedon Slovis threw his fourth touchdown pass of the first quarter. Slovis fit a perfect ball between three defenders to sophomore wide receiver Amon-Ra St. Brown for a 95-yard score that gave the Trojans an early 28-7 lead. 
It looked as though USC had learned from its scoring woes after a disappointing showing against Oregon last weekend. But in the end — after Arizona State outscored the Trojans 19-3 in the final three quarters — USC’s narrow 31-26 victory came down to a takeaway on the final drive.
The Sun Devils had the ball at the Trojans’ 32-yard line with just under a minute left when redshirt senior defensive lineman and team captain Christian Rector tipped a pass before making a diving interception to seal the deal for USC.
“To come on the road, down bodies, and those kids find a way to win and your captain makes the final play, it’s special,” head coach Clay Helton said. “That’s what captains do. They don’t wait for other people to make it happen. They make it happen, and I thought it was a very special moment for Christian.”
Through the first quarter, it looked like the Trojans — who were routed by Oregon 56-24 last weekend — would have the upper hand this time around.
Slovis broke USC’s record for most passing yards in the first quarter with 297. He also had four passing touchdowns in the first frame, including a 58-yarder to freshman running back Kenan Christon and the connection with St. Brown.
“It was a lot of fun,” Slovis said of the Trojans’ first quarter performance. “It showed what we can do with this offense when we execute. Later in the game, we did not execute as well. When we execute and everyone does their job, that is what it can look like.”
Slovis left the game for much of the third quarter and the beginning of the fourth due to a calf cramp, and redshirt junior Matt Fink led the Trojans to a field goal by redshirt sophomore kicker Chase McGrath. It was USC’s only score after the first quarter.
Christon appeared more versatile against ASU, tallying 82 yards receiving and getting 20 carries — the most of his young career. After toting 15 carries last week, it appears the coaches are placing more trust in the young back to balance out the pass-heavy Air Raid approach.
USC was forced to shift its defensive plan after it was announced shortly before game time that ASU freshman quarterback Jayden Daniels, known for his scrambling ability, would not be starting due to a leg injury. 
“We were really concerned about [Daniels] scrambling, he had a lot of carries out of the pocket,” defensive coordinator Clancy Pendergast said. “[ASU freshman quarterback Joey Yellen] was more of a traditional drop-back passer, and so we alerted the guys when we found out what the situation was going to be. It didn’t really change that many of the calls, just probably played a little bit more split-safety coverages, particularly once we got a lead.”
The Trojan defense held ASU to just 1 yard of total offense in the first quarter. The Sun Devils’ sole first-quarter touchdown was set up by a 97-yard kickoff return from ASU senior wide receiver Brandon Aiyuk.
The Trojans’ first-quarter dominance was not enough to put the Sun Devils away, though. USC’s offense failed to capitalize on two second-quarter takeaways, including a forced fumble by sophomore safety Talanoa Hufanga and an interception by redshirt sophomore safety Isaiah Pola-Mao. 
Penalties proved costly for both teams. Redshirt sophomore Jay Tufele’s roughing the passer penalty overturned an interception by Hufanga, and ASU’s subsequent touchdown narrowed the Trojans’ lead to 5. The Sun Devils could have taken the lead midway through the fourth quarter when Slovis threw a pick-six, but the play was called back due to a holding penalty on senior linebacker Khaylan Kearse-Thomas.
Although the Trojans gave up four passing touchdowns to Yellen in his debut, Pendergast said the defense accomplished its main goal — forcing ASU to win through the air.
“We wanted to come out here and put our foot down and say, ‘The back is not going to run the ball,’” Pendergast said. “But we were not going to allow them to run the football. They were going to have to beat us throwing the football. And the guys rose up, took the challenge on and I was happy with the numbers.”
The Trojans are now bowl-eligible after missing out on a bowl appearance last season. However, USC can’t afford complacency in its final two games against Cal and UCLA.
“It was huge,” Rector said of the Trojans’ win. “Now we are bowl-eligible. It is a big deal, especially after last year. Getting this win is important, especially going forward trying to get these next two.”

USC comfortably secured a 76-65 victory against the Portland Pilots Friday night at Galen Center. Portland played a competitive game throughout, but standout performances by two Trojan freshmen proved too much for it to handle. 
Freshman forward Onyeka Okongwu led USC with a team high 20 points while shooting 76.9% from the field. Okongwu also grabbed 10 rebounds — also a team high — including five on the offensive end.
“He does a lot on his own,” head coach Andy Enfield said of Okongwu after the game. “We don’t run a ton of plays for him … but he’s constantly …  running the floor. So he does a lot of it on his own, but in our system, he plays a very important position for us and he does it very well.” (2.20)
Enfield also had high praise for Okongwu’s performance on the glass.
“He’s able to read the ball when it’s in mid-air and go get it off the glass or off the rim, so you’ll see even when he doesn’t get it, he’s close or he’s tipping the ball or trying to get it,” Enfield said. “He’s relentless … It was very impressive.” 
Freshman guard Ethan Anderson also had himself a night. The Los Angeles native came off the bench and dished out a team high 10 assists to go along with four rebounds in 21 minutes. 
“He had a really controlled game [and] I thought he made the right reads,” Enfield said of Anderson. “Anytime you get 10 assists in a game, that’s impressive, especially for a freshman … He has great court vision, he’s a tough kid and I thought he gave us a big jump off the bench.” 
USC started the game fast and at one point led the Pilots by 12 points. After shooting 3-17 from beyond the arc in its first game, USC shot 53.9% from 3-point range in the first half Friday night. 
Unfortunately for the Trojans, the Pilots had a solid night beyond the arc themselves, shooting 46.4%. 
“Give Portland credit. I thought they came in and played an excellent basketball game,” Enfield said. “[They] made some shots. They made 13 threes — a few of those were very tough, contested threes, but give them credit because I felt they shot the ball great.”
After emerging from the first half leading by only 6, USC allowed the Pilots to tie the game at 48 with a jumper by redshirt junior guard Malcolm Porter with just over 15 minutes remaining. 
The tie would last all of 20 seconds before senior forward Nick Rakocevic scored to give the Trojans a lead they would not relinquish. 
Rakocevic finished the night with 11 points, three steals and eight rebounds. 
Several other upperclassmen also put up impressive numbers for USC. Senior guard Jonah Mathews scored 12 points, all of which came from behind the 3-point line. Redshirt senior guard Daniel Utomi picked up four rebounds — including three offensive — in 24 minutes.
Redshirt senior guard Quinton Adlesh had an impressive performance from deep as well. The transfer from Columbia University scored 9 points on a perfect 3-3 3-point shooting effort. 
Mathews described how important the veteran presence of Utomi and Adlesh is for the team.
“They come in the game and they already know what the deal is,” Mathews said. “They’ve been in college basketball for four-plus years, so you don’t have to tell them anything. Just having that experience with them on the court helps me a lot and all the young kids and the new guys. I like having them here.” 
Down the stretch, Anderson found Okongwu twice in the paint for an emphatic dunk and a layup.
“[Okongwu] helps a great deal,” Anderson said. “When I come off the pick and roll or whether I’m dribbling in transition, I can see that I have a lot of talent around me. So they can’t really help off-shooters, and then you have Big O coming and [it’s like] having a big safety net. So if my shot is not there, I can throw it anywhere by the rim and he just goes up and gets it … It makes my job a lot easier.” 
Of course, it wasn’t a perfect performance by USC. Enfield identified the areas the Trojans will need to improve moving forward. 
“The turnovers,” Enfield said after USC gave the ball away 20 times. “[Also] some of the defensive mistakes … [Portland] made 13 threes. So we’re going to have to try to run guys off the line and really be quicker to help.” 
USC will take on South Dakota State Tuesday night at Galen Center. Tip-off is at 7 p.m.
