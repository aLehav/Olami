Don’t try to pigeonhole the Harmonious Monks as the newest jazz-hop renaissance band, the next conscious rap group, or the fun-loving party rockers. In reality, they are all three.
In a musical era when the lines between genres and styles are blurrier than ever, you could say the group fits right in, even if its music doesn’t subscribe to the trap-heavy sound driving much of mainstream hip-hop. 
Evan Monroe, a junior majoring in psychology, goes by the stage name of Martin in his solo work. The ability to switch between topics is a major part of his philosophy on music. 
“It’s important to have social commentary and be able to speak on those things with nuanced opinions,” Monroe said. “But experiential anecdotes, things that people can relate to in the everyday life, are things that I really want to give color to.”
There are plenty of schemes artists devise to add color to their music, but the Harmonious Monks do it best with what comes most natural to them: their personalities. High-energy, lighthearted and quick-to-clown, the band doesn’t take itself too seriously and makes it easy for its audience to do the same. 
In addition to Martin, the emcee, the band is comprised of bassist John Mietus, a junior majoring in  classical bass; pianist and producer Cooper Holzman, a junior majoring in popular music; and drummer Trevor Zemtseff, a junior majoring in jazz studies.
“Trevor would want you to know he’s from Chicago; but then we would tell you he’s not actually from Chicago, he’s from Evanston,” Mietus said, drawing laughs from the other two as Zemtseff was absent from the interview. “Without him, though, this band would be crippled, because his contributions to the band as a composer, assistant producer and drummer … there’s just no comparison.”
The Harmonious Monks’ origin story dates back to their first weeks as freshmen at USC. Mietus was approached on the street by a random man who asked him if he played jazz, and instantly booked him and his nonexistent combo to play a show in two days. Eager to pull through, Mietus recruited Holzman from his residence hall and Zemtseff from his music theory class, and convinced them to perform with him at the show.
“I didn’t really give them a choice,” Mietus said. “I basically just said, ‘you’re doing this with me,’ I wasn’t missing out.”
Martin’s entry into the group came shortly after, following a vicious 2 a.m. rap battle against Mietus that formed a mutual appreciation between the two.
“It was literally neck and neck,” Monroe said. “Before that I had slain cats, but this was actually a challenge. The whole audience decided it was a draw, so we just kept freestyling and did a cypher, and people were losing it.”
Two years after discovering that instant chemistry, the Harmonious Monks are gearing up for the release of its debut album, Influence, on Friday. The album is socially conscious, designed to recognize how real-life experiences and people’s influence over one another contributes to their world views.
“There’s jazz drums mixed like metal drums, the bass is real, there’s a lot of synthesizers as well … it’s kind of this crazy mess of stuff that’s hard to even describe,” Holzman said. “I think our next album is going to be a lot more modern-sounding, but this one was very experimental.”
Martin’s background in alternative hip-hop, combined with the instrumentation that comes naturally to the jazz musicians, opened up a vast array of new directions in which the band memberscould take their music. “The Theory,” a single from the album that was released in July, brings all those musical elements to the forefront, backing the song’s vivacious lyrics and their fierce delivery. 
The visual for the song, a finalist at the Los Angeles Music Video Festival, synced with the messages in the song as well as its three-act format, ending with the various characters being pelted by raisins from the sky as a reference to Langston Hughes “Harlem” poem.
When asked about the reasoning behind incorporating the dried fruit, Monroe mentioned how the link between black poetry and black music can form a powerful juncture.
“Weaving traditional black poetry into an art form like this, that’s a very potent mix that black artists have always used to try to make social commentary,” Monroe said. “Connecting those two, especially in the third verse where all those things are coming to a climax, it’s supposed to represent a culmination of those dreams, and ideas, and just the pouring rain of feelings that comes with having a marginalized black experience in the United States.”
While the message certainly matters, the Harmonious Monks feels it takes more than simply imparting knowledge through the music for the band to be most effective. Their infectious characters allow them to speak on real issues while refraining from “preaching” to their listeners.
“The end goal of all this is to entertain people,” Monroe said. “You can share messages with people and still be entertaining, but what’s going to solidify that message is the feelings they get while you give it to them.”

Nestled in a historic flour mill in Los Angeles’ burgeoning Arts District is a visually opulent and hauntingly ethereal testament to misanthropy — Mike Kelley’s Kandors 1999-2011v series at Hauser & Wirth. 
On view for the first time in the United States, Kandors posthumously integrates Kelley’s representations of the fictional hero Superman’s birthplace, which Kelley created from 1999 to his death in 2012, and pays a mordant, yet moving tribute to themes of loss, entrapment and detachment. 
The story of Kandor, the capital of Superman’s home planet Krypton, is harrowing and fittingly retold by Kelley’s variant works. According to comic book lore, Kandor was shrunken by the villain Braniac and rescued by Superman, who harbored his city and its miniature citizens in a bell jar in his Fortress of Solitude. This narrative is dramatized in an immersive viewing experience that is equal parts electrifying and disheartening. 
The exhibit opens with Kelley’s sculptures of Kandor; 20 large-scale renditions of the city are illuminated by colored lights, encased in glass bell jars and displayed on pedestals throughout an otherwise black room. Snaking out of the tip of each bell jar is a hose connected to a gas tank, intended to parallel the Kryptonian oxygen Superman funneled into the jars to keep Kandor’s citizens alive. 
Walking through the room, the effect is a jarring meditation on the nature of loss and memory as visitors are forced to confront Superman’s metaphorical disconnection from his home. 
Kelley’s Kandors series is inspired by the story of Superman and explores the ethereality of his home city of Kandor. Photo courtesy of Hauser & Wirth.
Mounted on the wall in the next room are glowing images of Kandor, reminiscent of comic book drawings, but converted into back-lit lenticular prints that shift vaguely depending on the viewing angle. Through these pieces, Kelley highlights a contrast between the three-dimensional sculptures and the two-dimensional graphic illustrations, though both are vibrant and lifelike in their own right.
The sci-fi ethereality of Kandor and Superman’s story is most impressively evident in the multi-part, multimedia piece “Kandor 4,” consisting of large glass bottles and more sculptures of the city next to richly hued video projections of glittery debris swirling madly in bell jars. 
The zenith of the exhibit is a terrifyingly theatrical installation titled “Kandor 10B (Exploded Fortress of Solitude),” a black chrome cave-like structure littered with unnerving paraphernalia — boulders, a gas tank, a loose chain — that entices viewers merely through its magnitude and mystique. 
Projected on a wall inside the Fortress is the Extracurricular Activity Projective Reconstruction #36 “Vice Anglais” video, which satirically depicts costume-clad individuals milling about and engaging in sadomasochistic activities. All the while, hushed, static audio echoes around the dark grotto so that visitors are completely immersed in an environment of abject debauchery and perversion. From top to bottom in this elaborate piece, Kelley demonstrates his unrivaled capacity to bring the depths of his tortured psyche to life in vivid detail.
Hauser & Wirth Los Angeles’ winding layout makes the exhibit difficult to follow in its linearity, but has the effect of added complexity and convolution. Presented in total darkness with the sole sources of light emanating from the artworks themselves, Kandors is eerie, pessimistic and labyrinthine through and through. Borne from the recesses of the mind of a depressed genius, Kelley’s masterpieces offer a beautiful introspection on trauma and loneliness, bigger than life and conveyed through the lens of a cosmic apocalypse.

“No Drum And Bass In The Jazz Room” is the only album by instrumental math-rock/post-rock band Clever Girl, who split up less than a year after recording it. With ringing guitar chords, ethereal saxophone melodies, and driving yet meditative rhythms, the album finds a particular emotional space, simultaneously melancholy and hopeful and, at times, almost fun. I’m not here to tell you this album is good or bad; that’s for you to decide. All I can say is that on long days, when I’m lost in my own thoughts, this album has given me a profound sense of comfort and belonging. I hope it can do the same for you.
In my philosophical musings, I ask myself: What am I afraid of? I’m afraid of living a life that lacks meaning, of living a life based on a false or inadequate meaning. I’m afraid of losing the people close to me; I’m afraid of accidentally doing something that hurts them. I’m afraid of losing myself to the mundanities and complexities of everyday life, of losing my curiosity, my self-reliance and my sanity. I’m afraid of needing other people. I’m afraid of not knowing what lies in the future. Most of all, I’m afraid of living with regrets. 
Subsequently, I also ask myself: What would I do if I weren’t afraid? I think that if I weren’t afraid, I would be more open to other people. I would be more willing to accept possible meanings of life, despite their immediately apparent flaws. I would be more decisive. I would be more accepting of other people’s flaws as well as my own. If I weren’t afraid, I would be more accepting of my own ambiguous future.

Although philosophy may often seem abstract, abstruse and somewhat pretentious, it, in truth, studies how humans ought to live and, in its optimal form, provides a framework for making everyday decisions. Ultimately, every choice from what we eat for dinner to what career path we pursue boils down to each person’s personal philosophical framework. When examined in this light, philosophy can provide guidelines for how to live a productive and meaningful life.
Imagine that every single person is a philosopher and everyone has figured out his or her own path to living a good life. In this scenario, would everyone look back on their lives content with the decisions they had made and sure that they had fulfilled their purpose? The obvious answer is no. Humans cannot all be expected to find purpose in their lives, let alone make their every action an extension of that purpose. Humans make mistakes all the time, and what’s more, we only get one chance at being alive. Considering how hard it is to get anything right on the first try, to expect more than a select few humans to live “good” lives seems like an unrealistically high standard.
While I think it is important to hold myself to a high standard in all areas of life, I also believe that lowering my standards to live a meaningful life can assuage most of my fears. I have to accept that as a human, I will make mistakes. I will hurt people without meaning to. I will do things that lack purpose, or that go against my self-constructed meaning. I will do things that I regret. But that’s OK. This is my first and only time being alive and I’m trying to figure it out as I go, just like everyone else.

The No. 10 Trojans are considered among the most seasoned units in the country. Photo by Brian Chin | Daily Trojan
The USC men’s basketball team is back in action on Friday against Cal State Fullerton with a historic No. 10 ranking in the AP poll and high expectations. 
After reaching its second straight NCAA tournament last season, the veteran Trojan squad is anticipated to challenge No. 3 Arizona this year in a conference that lost a majority of its talent to the NBA — despite the fact that Trojan assistant coach Tony Bland was charged with bribery and wire fraud and is the subject of an internal investigation.
But for fifth-year head coach Andy Enfield, preseason rankings aren’t nearly as important as the final results.
“It’s quite an accomplishment for our players,” Enfield said. “We’re excited about the possibilities we’re having this year. However, preseason rankings are just that — it’s preseason.”
Many credit USC’s jump in the poll to a loaded roster that returns all of last season’s starters and also brings in a very talented freshman class. But until the team takes to the court, it’s simply speculation.
“We have to go prove ourselves — we don’t take anything for granted,” Enfield said. “We have a very challenging out-of-conference schedule, and the Pac-12 is as good as it’s ever has been. We know, because we’re ranked, that teams are going to knock us down. We have to get better and not be focused on the end result.”
Of the newcomers, redshirt sophomore guard Derryck Thornton, who sat out last season after transferring from Duke, is expected to be a huge factor off the bench in 2017 after earning starting minutes as a Blue Devil. After a long wait, he’s excited to finally introduce himself at USC.
“It feels unreal,” Thornton said. “It feels so good to get back out there. I’m so excited to get out there and compete. That Duke team accomplished a lot of good things, but I’m in a new chapter of my life with a new group of guys and coaching staff. The past is the past, and I’m ready to move on, and make the most for this program.”
Along with Thornton, the Trojans also welcome three freshmen to the roster this season: guard Chuck O’Bannon, forward Victor Oyaelunmo and wing Jordan Usher. 
After being named a team captain this offseason, junior forward Chimezie Metu feels pressure to set an example for his younger teammates.
“Even though I don’t think of myself as a leader, the guys on my team think it, so I have to step up,” Metu said. “I’m trying to be there for my guys when they’re down or go into slumps. I know I’m not the perfect person, but I know if I can help guys when they’re down and help them up that it will be a huge boost for us.”
This offseason, the team has struggled to clean up its defensive miscues during preseason scrimmages.
Senior shooting guard Elijah Stewart, a co-captain alongside Metu and senior guard Jordan McLaughlin, emphasized that stopping opposing offenses will be just as important as scoring buckets.
“The pieces are there,” Stewart said. “We just have to know how to put them together, especially mingling freshmen into the lineup. Defensively, we have to start trusting each other a little bit more. Defense is something that we’re really going for this year because the way that we play: We have to get stops, get rebounds and run out.”
Friday’s home opener against Cal State Fullerton will be a stiff defensive test to kick off USC’s season. The Titans bring back top scorers Kyle Allman, Jr., Jackson Rowe and Khalil Ahmad to a talented roster that put up more than 100 points in a 112-57 exhibition romp over La Verne last Saturday. 
McLaughlin is excited for the challenge and said he is fired up for this season and another run at an NCAA championship. 
“I’m super hungry for a national title,” McLaughlin said. “I’ve been making sure I stay healthy, that everybody else stays healthy. We’re competing at a high level, and everybody’s so talented on this team. Everybody’s fighting for minutes. It’s good for the team that we’re competing at a high level because come March, everybody’s going to be competing at a high level.”
The Trojans tip off their season against the Titans Friday at 7 p.m. at the Galen Center.

The football team is coming off a 49-35 victory over Arizona last week that put USC in the driver’s seat for the Pac-12 South. The Trojans took to the practice field Wednesday preparing for their final road game of the season against Colorado in Boulder.
Eyes on Colorado
The focus of Wednesday’s practice was on rushing the passer. Head coach Clay Helton cited pressure as a key part of the Trojans’ victory over the Buffaloes last year, and he said it would be the same in this matchup against returning quarterback Steven Montez.
“Watching tape, when [Montez] is able to sit back in the pocket, he’s deadly,” Helton said. “They’re averaging 260 yards passing per game, and when it’s a nice day for him, he has all the arm strength in the world to deliver the ball wherever he wants to.”
The Buffalo offense is led by Montez and running back Phillip Lindsay. Lindsay has run for 1,334 yards and 12 touchdowns on 5.1 yards per attempt. Montez has thrown for 2,404 yards and 16 touchdowns this season on 62.3 completion percentage and eight yards per attempt. The Buffaloes spread the ball evenly through the air as well, as three different receivers have at least 38 catches for 468 yards.
“We’ve got to make sure we stop the run and get off on third downs,” redshirt sophomore linebacker John Houston Jr. said when asked about the keys to the game against Colorado. “Trying to get turnovers [and] sacks — anything possible. He’s a good quarterback, so we have to stop him for sure.”
On the other side of the ball, the offense prepared for Colorado’s third-down blitz packages.
“We’re just trying to keep [the ball] away from an offense that’s averaging over 400 yards per game right now,” Helton said. 
Colorado is vulnerable on defense: The Buffaloes rank 103rd in the country with 439 total yards allowed per game. Last week, they allowed 583 yards and 41 points to Arizona State, which the Trojans held to 357 yards and 17 points the week before.
Motivated Buffaloes
Though Colorado has disappointed this season, sitting at the bottom of the Pac-12 South, Helton made it clear that it is not to be taken lightly.
“It’s senior day there — a blackout game — and they’re fighting for bowl eligibility,” Helton said. “I bet you they’d love to do it against the Trojans. We’re going to get their best effort.”
Helton also believes Colorado’s record is misleading.
“If you go back and really study who they are, you’re talking about heartbreaking losses versus Arizona and UCLA,” Helton said. “They’re ahead for 48 minutes against Arizona State. They’re playing really good football, and they could be coming in here with eight victories if it weren’t for four or five plays per game. They’ve just played really tight games in this Pac-12.”
Injury Update
Helton said that there were no changes from the previous day’s injury report but did note that he was hoping to get a few players back and would be cleared by tomorrow.
“We’ll see where [senior linebacker] Uchenna [Nwosu] is tomorrow,” Helton said. “I know his ankle is feeling a lot better.”
Nwosu was held out of practice Wednesday due to an injury.
In addition, Helton was happy with freshman tight end Josh Falo’s practice. Falo returned to the field Tuesday for the first time since going down with a foot injury last month, and Helton said his return could help the team this coming week.
Helton also said redshirt sophomore defensive lineman Christian Rector was moving extremely well Wednesday. Helton said that Rector was listed as “day-to-day” and could possibly play this week. Rector has been out since injuring his hand in practice on Oct. 25.

After dropping one spot in the rankings after a loss at Cal, the No. 2 men’s water polo team looks to rebound in its regular season finale against No. 4 UCLA on Saturday. Last weekend, the team went 1-1, falling to the now top-ranked Bears and defeating No. 5 Pacific. With a national championship on their mind, the Trojans (22-2) look to avenge an early-season loss to the Bruins (17-3) when they travel to Westwood.
When the Trojans last faced UCLA in the championship game of the Mountain Pacific Invitational on Sept. 24, they lost 13-11, going back and forth with UCLA for most of the third quarter. 
“I think there were just all these little things that we messed up on and that we have gotten better at recently,” senior utility James Walters said. “Throughout the season, we’ve become a totally different team, so I’m excited to see where that will take us this weekend.”
At practices, the team has been focusing on refining its game after the disappointing loss to Cal (18-1).
“We’re going to focus a lot of our attention on finishing out high-percentage opportunities,” senior driver Blake Edwards said. “They’re critical to the overall outcome of the game.”
The Trojans last defeated the Bruins in Westwood in 2014. Though UCLA boasts a roster that includes seven seniors and eight All-Americans, Edwards said USC is ready to handle the Bruins and their home crowd.
“It’s a big opportunity,” Edwards said. “We love any game against UCLA. This team’s been together for three years now, so we’re well used to these pressured situations.”
As the match against UCLA marks the end of the regular season, the Trojans have the upcoming MPSF Tournament and the NCAA Championships in mind. 
“We just want to win a national championship — that’s the one goal for everyone this season,” Walters said. “That’s the entire team. That’s all we’re thinking about. So winning the game this weekend is huge for us: We need a big win going into the MPSF Tournament.”

Several days ago, I grew nostalgic for baseball season and subjected several of my sorority sisters to the movie Field of Dreams.
The Kevin Costner classic is one of those feel-good movies that’s basically a surefire way to test the quality of someone’s soul character. (If they cry at the final scene, their soul’s doing okay. If they don’t cry, they don’t have one.) None of the sisters who I forced to watch the movie were baseball fans, which led to widespread surprise from all of them when they found themselves bawling as the credits rolled.
The film centers around a farmer, Ray, who follows a divine message and builds a baseball diamond in the middle of his cornfield in Iowa. Over time, the baseball greats of the past — Shoeless Joe Jackson, Buck Weaver, Eddie Cicotte — visit the diamond to play the sport they loved so dearly. Every night, they disappear into the cornfield, beyond which, we can only assume, is the afterlife.
At one point, a starry-eyed baseball player looks at the picturesque diamond, then turns to Ray and asks, “Is this heaven?”
It’s one of those lines that hits you in the gut much harder than you expect. There’s something surreptitiously poetic about the idea of some eternal game of baseball for the star players who devoted their lives to it. It’s an even more poignant symbol when, all too often, we lose these stars too soon.
On Tuesday, news broke that Roy Halladay — a well-loved former pitcher for the Toronto Blue Jays and the Philadelphia Phillies — died in a plane crash in the Gulf of Mexico. He was 40 years old, a two-time Cy Young Award-winning pitcher enjoying his fourth year of retirement. 
This might not have affected me at all if it weren’t for the fact that I spent last summer as an intern at the Philadelphia Inquirer. My Twitter feed, which grows increasingly eclectic and diverse every year, is now dominated by about 30 percent Philadelphia sports news. When Halladay passed away, it seemed that the only news that mattered on Twitter had to do with his death.
When we lose an athlete, the thing that’s hard to explain to those who aren’t fans of sports is what exactly we are mourning. Sure, Halladay was an eight-time All-Star with a stellar ERA. He threw a perfect game for the Phillies in 2010, then followed it up with a postseason no-hitter in the NLDS, notching his own sidebar in the history books of the sport. 
But as fans, we mourn more than just statistics and record-setting performances. We mourn the people, the players who put on the jerseys and somehow lift the pride of our cities onto their shoulders. Perhaps the greatest flaw of sports fans is the way that we put so much stock and hope into these players who we hardly know. When they win, we win, and when they lose, we lose. We follow them on Instagram and bug them for signatures and obsess over their shoes, their hair, their taste in food and music and politics.
And then, when these players die, we feel a loss and a trauma almost too large for the relatively small impact they should have had upon our lives. I watched this as the fans of Philadelphia posted tributes and erected memorials to the former pitcher, congregating around Citizens Bank Park in crowds larger than many of those that attended the games I covered last summer.
I understand the pain that the city of Philadelphia is feeling, mainly because it was my pain only months ago. I was walking to the Daily Trojan office when I learned that Yordano Ventura, a young, loud-mouthed, hothead of a pitcher for my Kansas City Royals, had died in a tragic car accident. Months later, I still come close to tears when watching tributes made in Ventura’s honor.
The loss of Halladay had the same effect on the city of Philadelphia. There’s a pain that comes from losing these athletes, mainly because we see them as invincible. Halladay, in particular, was indomitable on the mound, this towering 6-foot-6 testament to a pitcher’s ability to exert ice-cold control over a baseball. 
He was unflappable, nicknamed “Doc” because of the almost surgical way he could pick apart even the strongest team’s batting lineup. Halladay was a leader, and then a legend, for a Phillies team stuck in a down-on-its-luck period that many teams skid into after winning a World Series. He gave the city something to cheer for.
When I think of this loss, the idea of that diamond in Iowa is comforting. Because the thing about sports fans is that we’re terrible at letting go.
These players live on in memories and highlight reels, and their names and numbers are emblazoned in halls of fame and retired jerseys hanging from the rafters of stadiums. Great athletes may pass away, but their impact on the game hardly ever leaves.
I hope Halladay joined in on that eternal game, in some baseball diamond that looks a little like heaven. The game will always remember his life; and in that way, I hope he will live on in the game as well.

ROY HALLIDAY WAS A GREAT PITCHER AND A GREAT HUMAN BEING. I HAVE BEEN A PHILLIES FAN FOR 58 YEARS AND I THANK HIM FOR HIS GREAT SERVICE TO MY BELOVED PHILLIES. RIP,ROY.

Three months ago, Google fired software engineer James Damore after he released “Google’s Ideological Echo Chamber,” a 10-page memo that criticized the company’s diversity initiatives aimed at hiring more minorities. In his screed, Damore attributes the gender gap in STEM jobs not to sexism, but to fundamental psychological differences between the two sexes. He points out that because they are “more prone to anxiety,” women cannot handle the high-stress environment in a company like Google. Damore even goes as far as to argue that men are being discriminated against by Google’s inclusivity policies, claiming that “discrimination to reach equal representation is unfair, divisive, and bad for business.” 
Damore’s judgments are bold, to say the least — but it is particularly concerning to think that he may not be alone in his beliefs. The ideas presented in his rant are representative of the common, yet toxic mindset in places like Silicon Valley: Men are simply more qualified to handle the tough jobs in the STEM field. 
And it is even more concerning that on the surface, these men might just be correct. In colleges, men largely outnumber women in certain science and technology majors. According to a study by the National Student Clearinghouse, undergraduate women received just 18 percent of computer science degrees and 19 percent of engineering degrees. 
Aside from Damore’s claims that are primarily based on factless stereotypes, there is no real support for the idea that one gender is smarter than the other in the scope of science and mathematics. The only evidence of a gap between the sexes comes from ongoing social constructs rooted in patriarchal notions of what a working man and a working woman should look like; men are doctors and engineers, and women are nurses and teachers. Men outnumber women in the STEM field not because they are more intelligent, but because they are provided more opportunities.
A great deal of this discrepancy can be seen in professional settings: because the workforce is dominated by men, who may hire more of their own gender. Such internal biases create a cycle that can unfairly impact women in the long run, which is why companies like Google implement diversity initiatives. 
But often, that hostile environment is not just created by a lack of job opportunities. Turning the focus to college campuses, a 2016 report by The Atlantic highlights that the astonishing amount of sexual harassment lawsuits at UCLA, UC Berkeley and the University of Chicago can be traced to the fact that the women who filed them were dependent on good recommendations from their professors for future careers in STEM. The vast majority of faculty and leadership holes at these campuses are composed of men, and as a result, there exists a disproportionate power dynamic putting women at greater risk of being taken advantage of, and lacking the connections and resources to fight back. Echoing the article’s title, many women are literally being “harassed out of science.” 
That is why college campuses are so crucial when considering how to close the gender gap in STEM. Universities can start examining their practices in hiring professors, because a higher amount of female instructors may contribute to a safer learning environment that is conducive to fostering the growth of all students. Although USA Today recently ranked USC third in STEM education for women, the University is not immune to gender imbalance: Only one third of STEM department faculties are female. 
The challenges faced by women of racial and ethnic minorities or the LGBTQ community are often even greater. Because the STEM field’s culture is dominated by straight, white men, many marginalized groups are discouraged from seeking futures in STEM. For instance, as stated by U.S. News & World Report, whereas whites and Asians hold positions in 87 percent of the engineering workforce, African Americans and Latinx people comprise just 12 percent. In addition, The New York Times reported that out of 1,400 lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and queer STEM professionals surveyed, a striking 43 percent reported that they were “closeted” — indicating a general lack of acceptance in the field.
That said, STEM subjects are difficult. The argument that employers should prioritize quality of work is a perfectly sound one; especially when it comes to technological advancements, what one has to offer is more important than their status as a minority figure. Fairness does not mean complete equality. It means equal opportunity, which, as mentioned before, is not easy to come by. 
If people truly want to see more minorities successfully working STEM jobs, university action is not enough; stereotypes must be broken early on. Because an interest in the sciences is generally developed before college, it would be effective to enhance STEM education for adolescents by implementing a more inclusive curriculum. Organizations like Girls Who Code are already making great strides in this area, and perhaps they will pave the way for the further representation of marginalized groups. 
It’s ironic that an industry as innovative as STEM can encourage such regressive mindsets among its workers. While it is true that employers need to give minorities the positions they deserve, we make progress when we rid ourselves of the notion that the STEM professional is a white man in a lab coat. Science isn’t for everyone right now — but it can be.  
STEM is unequivocally theee most difficult academic area. This is probably the 4th, 5th article I’ve read on the now, SJW, Daily Trojan decrying the “inequality” in STEM. 
Do more research prior to making rash, imbecilic assertions. And I bet you’re majoring in some basket weaving degree there, Ryan. So you don’t know from experience….Typical SJW moron.
Women are %58 of the college population. Annenberg School consists of approximately %70 women. We need to stop this feminazi oppression. Can we please have affirmative action for men as soon as possible? Thanks in advance.

Prior to Tuesday evening, it’s difficult for me to recall the last time news from the American political arena brought me hope. Wednesday marked one year since Donald Trump was elected president in a devastating blow to not only Hillary Clinton — a woman who had dedicated her life to public service — but also, ultimately, to our nation’s most basic notions of human decency. Put simply, it has not been an easy year. For undocumented families made to live in fear of separation; for low-income women forced to brace themselves for new limits on their reproductive options; for LGBTQ people made uncertain of what Trump’s promised, new era of religious freedom would mean for their right to equal treatment — this first year of Trump’s term has felt like a lifetime. 
But Tuesday was a day carved out of the rest of Trump’s presidency — it was special, not only a day of hope but also a much-needed reminder of the political power vested in this emotion. Former President Barack Obama ran and won on this particular sentiment — hope — in 2008 and 2012, and in Virginia, New Jersey, Washington and states and cities across the country, a diverse group of Democratic lawmakers brought it back to a fractured party, and more importantly, to a hurting nation. 
And yet, hope was not the only thing Tuesday brought us — it also delivered a crucial reminder of what, exactly, “identity politics” is, and its increasing importance in the Trump era despite an influx of bipartisan hostility directed at it.
On top of governors-elect Ralph Northam of Virginia and Phil Murphy of New Jersey, Tuesday’s victors included Danica Roem, a former journalist who will become the first openly transgender member of the Virginia General Assembly come January; Andrea Jenkins, who will become Minneapolis’ first openly transgender woman of color elected to office; Vi Lyles, who will become Charlotte, N.C.’s first black female mayor; Joyce Craig, who will become the first female mayor of Manchester, N.H.; and more — so many more — inspiring and historic firsts. As news of their triumphs reverberates throughout social media, their identifiers on the basis of their marginalized identities will be spread along and celebrated, too, and it’s important to remember that we should not be silent about this. 
Notably, earlier this year, Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders chastised a young Latina candidate for having the audacity to speak about her experiences and their impact on her politics, saying of her, “It is not good enough for someone to say, ‘I’m a woman! Vote for me!’” 
Sanders semed to imply that female, minority candidates try to gain advantage in America’s white, male-dominated political sphere by screaming their race or gender from the rooftops, that they offer nothing of substance beyond this, and that he, as a white male, gets to unilaterally say what makes a candidate “good enough.” Of course, this is not only offensive, but also plainly inaccurate — if Sanders is suggesting that being a marginalized identity makes winning elections easier, I’d love to hear him explain Congress’ 80 percent white, 80 percent male makeup to me.
But to the point, his words seemed to be part of a greater trend that, following the loss of the first female nominee of a major American political party, liberals ought to rally around non-identity related issues. Tuesday night — which saw the election of two trans women, a black woman and a first female mayor of her respective city — functioned as a reminder of why this would be a mistake. 
Here are some unsettling realities that everyone should be aware of: Trans women are 4.3 times more likely than cisgender women to be murdered, 87 percent of trans people murdered from 2013 to 2015 were people of color and the homicide rate toward trans people in America has steadily been on the rise, according to the most recent available data from the Human Rights Campaign. Trans youth are more likely than any other group to wind up homeless, and of the 40 percent of trans adults who report having attempted to commit suicide, 92 percent of these attempts took place before they turned 25.

Myriad statistics reflect an overarching, national issue of racially biased policing and a mass incarceration crisis built on punishing people for the color of their skin. African American women are incarcerated at twice the rate of white women, and the majority of prisons subject pregnant women — who constitute roughly 4 percent of women who arrive in prisons — to inhumane conditions. Across the country and in the state of New Hampshire, which, as previously mentioned, just elected the first female mayor of Manchester, the debate about public funding for abortion — whether or not low-income women should have the same rights as their economically privileged counterparts — is picking up steam. 
None of the aforementioned issues would be neatly solved with a $15 minimum wage, tuition-free college or universal health care. Many marginalized groups would disproportionately benefit from such policies, but the idea that their suffering would be eradicated with the implementation of these policies is laughably out of touch.  
The concept of “identity politics” has always emerged from the notion that issues that disproportionately affect women, people of color, the LGBTQ community and other historically marginalized groups are softer, less relevant. That “identity politics” entails issues that should be ignored because they are “divisive,” that implementing a few progressive economic policies would somehow make all of the problems related to identity evaporate into thin air. 
The simple truth is that our identities affect the things we care about, the things we understand, the things we experience. Representation matters because it critically affects politics — and politics critically affects our everyday lives. 
Tuesday’s Democratic victors will enact policies that benefit the people they represent. That’s important, but there’s no need to downplay the symbolic magnitude of their victories after a year of watching Trump empower bigots to score point after point. 
In January, the month of Trump’s inauguration, The Atlantic’s Ta-Nehisi Coates wrote about Obama’s symbolic importance to the black community in a country built on the backs of slaves. His words remind us that when Roem — who was repeatedly addressed with male pronouns by her Republican rival — and Jenkins won their respective elections, they didn’t just win for themselves. They won for all of the trans and non-binary children who now live in a country where they know that they can grow up, run for office and win.
The promise of America has always been that anyone, regardless of any facet of their identity, can achieve anything that they are willing to work for. I would be lying if I said Nov. 8, 2016 didn’t feel like the death of a collective national dream — it certainly felt like the death of mine. And yet, here we are, one year later: hopeful.

Funny how this self-serving feminist forgets to mention that the prison system primarily targets men. %82 of all prisoners are men and men routinely get higher sentences than women for every crime category (%63 in non-sexual crimes). In sexual crimes the rates are even higher, since female rapists are almost never punished.

Barton Nagata served in the military division that liberated Dachau, one of the first Nazi concentration camps. Photo courtesy of USC Shoah Foundation.
Barton Nagata, a Japanese American, lived in Hawaii for most of his early life. When Pearl Harbor was bombed by Japan during World War II, he was attending college in Iowa. Because Nagata couldn’t return to Hawaii during the war, he joined the military and served in the division that liberated Dachau, one of the first Nazi concentration camps opened during the Holocaust. 
Nagata’s story is one of many told by soldiers who helped liberate genocide survivors, documented in “Liberation” broadcast from Comcast, in collaboration with the USC Shoah Foundation Center for Advanced Genocide Research.
The broadcast series documents not only the soldiers, but also those liberated from the Holocaust, according to Lauren Carter, the Shoah Foundation’s media production manager. 
“Liberation” was released to Comcast on-demand subscribers on Wednesday, and the program is the fourth in a yearly collaboration between the foundation and Comcast, where Shoah Foundation testimonies are paired with a feature film. 
This year, the “Liberation” theme pairs the 1998 film Saving Private Ryan with testimonies from the Shoah Visual History Archive. It will also include the documentary feature Liberators: Why We Fought.
“We’re really taking the next seven weeks to focus on liberation and [its complexities],” Carter said. “Not all of [the testimonies are from] liberators themselves, but also those who are liberated, and [they address] what it means to be free, what it means to be a refugee in your home country. A lot of these topics that are relevant to topics we’re looking at today — it’s very interesting how history repeats itself.”
The program will be available on Comcast until Dec. 29.
Carter said the foundation chose to focus on the theme of liberation because it fits well with the upcoming holidays. 
According to Carter, the seven-week period that the show will be available to Comcast subscribers spans Veterans Day, Thanksgiving and goes into December, which is different than previous years.
“This ‘Liberation’ theme has fit very well with Veteran’s Day, and being able to make that connection to those who have served in the armed forces. And Thanksgiving, giving thanks for those who have [gone] above and beyond themselves and done these incredible acts in the service of strangers.” 
Along with the content available to Comcast subscribers, the Shoah Foundation also created a microsite around the theme of liberation, which includes more Visual History Archive testimonies, as well as primary documents surrounding the theme of liberation, such as a letter written by an American soldier detailing life during World War II. 
“[The viewer] will be able to … really delve more into the material, see other testimonies, potential educational applications of [the] testimony, how that testimony is impacting modern life, blog posts [and] all kinds of different content available there,” Carter said.
Previous years’ collaborative themes have included “The Miracle of Music,” which focused on how music helped Holocaust survivors in concentration camps, and “Defiance,” which revealed how some victims chose to rebel against fascist rule while in concentration camps, Carter said. 
The Shoah Foundation is currently in its fourth year of a five-year partnership with Comcast to provide these programs, but Carter said the foundation hopes to continue and expand the partnership for years to come.
CORRECTION: An earlier version of the story stated that the “Liberation” broadcast is from the USC Shoah Foundation. The broadcast is from Comcast, in collaboration with the foundation. The Daily Trojan regrets this error.

Members of Environmental Core gathered in Hahn Plaza Wednesday to urge University officials to use solar panels for electricity. Photo by Tucker Judkins | Daily Trojan
Environmental Core, a student environmental activist club, held its annual solar rally to advocate for USC to transition to solar panels on Wednesday afternoon.
USC is not exactly known for its commitment to sustainability, said Tianna Shaw-Wakeman, the head of the Go Solar Carbon Neutrality Campaign for Environmental Core. 
The administration has told the club that solar panels are not financially feasible for USC at this time, Shaw-Wakeman said, but the activists still wanted to spread the word. 
“For the past four to five years, we’ve been pushing USC to commit to solar energy,” Shaw-Wakeman said. “A lot of those efforts have not come to fruition. However, we want to make sure that students, faculty and the entire Trojan family are aware that there is still a student push for solar energy and that will never go away.”
However, Mark Ewalt, USC’s executive director of administrative operations, said the installation of solar technology would cost the University more than it would help it. USC would have to retrofit old buildings to install solar panels, according to Ewalt. 
“To install solar [panels] on a building, you have to go into the walls, for infrastructure, for electrical, for those things that you connect it with — you un-grandfather that,” Ewalt said. “Those things really make solar [energy] a very expensive proposition. It’s good, it’s the right thing to do, but the cost-benefit pushes the return on that investment out three years. The question we ask, ‘Is that the best spend of your tuition money?’ We think no, because of the way it’s loaded there.”
But members of the Environmental Core, or ECore, were not pleased Ewalt’s explanation. Simon Blessenohl, an ECore member and a Ph.D. student studying philosophy, said money should not be the main consideration when it comes to sustainability. 
“The thing we maximize here is not USC’s profit,” Blessenohl said. “The thing we maximize is welfare of the global population, really … I think it’s just the wrong way to think about the problem. Even if it doesn’t break even, it’s still worth the investment because the returns are not in dollars, but in welfare of people.”
Blessenohl also believes that the University has demonstrated its priorities based on its spending.
“If you look at the magnitude of investments USC has done in the past — like $700 million for the new Village, zero dollars for solar power — I guess that should all make us think about whether the people who make these decisions have the right priorities,” Blessenohl said. 
However, ECore members wanted to remind students and faculty that there are other ways of being a sustainable campus aside from using solar energy. Philine Qian, director of sustainability affairs for Undergraduate Student Government and an ECore member, thinks there are more ways to achieve a sustainable campus. 
“We need to be carbon neutral, we need to be energy efficient, and we need to be smarter about our energy decisions in general,” Qian said. “Solar energy is not the only answer. It can be part of the answer, but we have much more work to do.”
Qian pointed out the lack of involvement from the USC administration, noting how the push for sustainability initiatives mostly stems from students. 
“I think it’s sad because, really, the University’s sustainability structure is run by about 10 people on our campus — it’s really stressful,” Qian said. “Not to be mistaken, there are people who care. But I just don’t feel there’s an urgent need [for change], and that’s how sustainability groups have felt for years.”
However, Ewalt said that it is USC’s location that makes it impossible for the University to approve solar panels. 
“Solar [energy], for a number of reasons, does not work very well at USC in this Los Angeles basin region,” Ewalt said. “And the reason that it doesn’t is the cost-benefit proposal for solar [energy] in this region, which is owned by the Department of Water and Power. Los Angeles’ Department of Water and Power prohibits certain cost benefits that would make solar affordable.” 
According to Ewalt, if USC were to install solar panels on every building, those solar panels would only produce enough energy to cover 10 percent of USC’s total power usage. The power collected would go back into the energy grid, essentially stopping USC from using its own power, Ewalt said. And according to Ewalt, there is no tax-benefit incentive because USC is a tax-exempt institution.
Ewalt agreed that USC is behind its peers in sustainability programs and said President C. L. Max Nikias has been focusing on raising USC in academic rankings. 
“To accomplish that much in that short amount of time, you have to concentrate on the main thing, which is academics, student teaching and research,” Ewalt said. “And so they concentrated on those areas, and to do that you have to leave some other things off the table.”
Shaw-Wakeman argued, however, that since USC is focused on research, it should understand the importance of solar panels. 
“I think it’s actually surprising, because USC’s mission statement is focused on research and academia,” Shaw-Wakeman said. “One of the core things with research is you don’t usually expect anything in the next three years. Research usually takes tons of time, it takes a lot of money, it takes a lot of effort. But your goal is for people and your goal is usually future-oriented and the exact same is true with environmentalism.”
ECore members believe that the University should strive to make a positive environmental impact for future generations. 
“If USC’s statement is for research and for a better future, that’s environmentalism, and that’s sustainability, and that’s what needs to be focused on in the solar decision,” Shaw-Wakeman said.

Luis Alfaro’s play, Oedipus El Rey, is a modern retelling of the Greek tragedy and developed from Alfaro’s conversations, volunteer and political work. Photo from USC News.
Luis Alfaro’s method of writing is different from that of most playwrights. As an associate professor of dramatic writing, he never works alone. Alfaro develops his plays inside his community — constructing them from his conversations, volunteer work and political involvement in organizations. 
“Every time I have an idea for a play, I find out what world it lives in and then I go to that world,” Alfaro said. 
A reliance on community led Alfaro to explore the world of ex-prison inmates to help him develop Oedipus El Rey, a modern retelling of the Greek tragedy, which is running at The Public Theater in New York.
Alfaro said he started by interviewing people from Homeboy Industries, a gang prevention organization that supports formerly incarcerated people and is based in Los Angeles.
“It was really helpful … in terms of listening to people’s stories and being able to figure out why people get in gangs, [and] why people go to prison,” Alfaro said.
His interest in the prison system arose from reading about recidivism, or the relapse into criminal behavior. When Alfaro discovered that the recidivism rate for young men in the state of California was over 50 percent, he wondered what caused it.
In an effort to challenge his community and the high recidivism rates, Alfaro wrote Oedipus El Rey as an artistic medium for social change. He hoped that audience members would see the play and want to address the issues related to the prison system and its negative impact on young minority men.
“How do we talk about power? How do we talk about education? How do we talk about the violence of poverty?” Alfaro asked himself when writing the play.
In Alfaro’s belief that those issues affected the recidivism rate, he set his Greek tragedy in a modern-day prison. Alfaro saw he could still use the play to comment on today’s prison system, although the original Greek tragedy is thousands of years old. 
“I love it when the audience comes in and they start watching this play and it’s all about them, the prisoners, and at some point,  [the audience] starts to think that ‘them’ is us,” Alfaro said. “If we start talking about these young men of color who are in prison as our children, then we want to go into action, right? In some ways, I am trying to change the language from them to us.”
Alfaro said he has two goals as a playwright. One is to see more people of color in mainstream stories so they can have agency over their narratives and tell the stories that are really important to them. Alfaro said Oedipus El Rey gave him the rare opportunity to use an all-Latinx cast.
“I got to have an all-people of color design team and even my backstage crew is all women of color,” Alfaro said. 
Having the ability to have a minority cast and crew provided members of these groups the opportunity to work on mainstream stories relating to issues impacting their communities, Alfaro added. 
Alfaro’s second goal is to shepherd the next generation of artists. He wants USC students to take a playwriting class, focus on writing great plays instead of getting an agent, stay loyal to writing, network and submit to theaters and festivals. 
“How I work in [the] community is interesting to students,” Alfaro said. “When a student wants to know how to do this work, I say to them you’ve got to just become part of the world that you live in.”

Tony Bland said he was in on the plan. He would help facilitate money to relatives of two USC basketball players, who would then be referred to the services of Christian Dawkins, a would-be sports agent, and Munish Sood, a financial adviser.
But, according to a federal criminal complaint filed in the Southern District of New York in September, Bland had a catch: He didn’t want to “touch” the money.
“I want it all to go through you,” Bland said to Dawkins over the phone on the morning of Aug. 31, according to the document. 
Bland, the associate men’s basketball coach at USC, was one of 10 people arrested in September for allegedly taking part in a corruption ring that involved undercover FBI agents and promises to funnel money to USC players and to direct players to agents.
On Tuesday, he was formally indicted on charges that involved conspiracy to commit bribery and honest services wire fraud. He faces four charges in total. 
But the complaint describes Bland’s motives in more detail, zeroing in on Aug. 31, when Bland met with Dawkins, Sood and an undercover FBI agent at a restaurant on the USC campus. During the meeting, which was recorded by the agent, Bland talked about his approach to influencing players such as “Player-8,” a USC player or recruit who has not been identified in court filings.
“Some guys, like [Player-8], I can say, this is what you’re doing, but other guys, the sooner you get in, you gotta, kind of push them that way and before it’s too late, it’s what they’re doing,” Bland said, according to the complaint.
Bland later boasted about his ability to “get the players” to accept bribes.
“I can definitely mold the players and put them in the lap of you guys,” he said. 
According to the document, Bland admitted to previously being presented with opportunities to receive payments from advisers or agents, but he trusted Dawkins.
“Everything you’re saying is exactly what I’m looking for,” Bland said, referring to Dawkins. “It’s not been this clean from a guy that I trust.” 
After the meeting, the complaint said that Dawkins and Sood went to a hotel in Los Angeles and met with the relative of “Player-9,” another USC player or recruit to whom Bland allegedly facilitated money. Bland had arranged the meeting, according to the document, and had arranged for $5,000 to be given to the unnamed player’s family. In all, Bland is accused of funneling $9,000 to the families of “Player-8” and “Player-9.”
During the meeting, Dawkins and the relative discussed “the plan,” which was for the player to enter the upcoming NBA Draft.
Bland also negotiated how much he would be paid to take part in the scheme, according to the complaint. On July 26, Dawkins told an undercover agent that Bland wanted to be paid $6,000, but before Bland met with Dawkins, the agent and a cooperating witness at a Las Vegas hotel room three days later, Dawkins told the agent that Bland, in fact, wanted $13,000.
It was at this meeting that Bland told Dawkins he had “heavy influence” over USC basketball players and could funnel players to Dawkins as clients, the document said. Following the meeting, in exchange for the money, Bland arranged for Dawkins and Sood to meet with family members of “Player-8” and “Player-9,” according to the complaint, and assured them that the players would sign with their company.
Bland, who has been an assistant coach since 2014, is currently on administrative leave. USC hired Louis Freeh, a former FBI director, to conduct an internal investigation.
The team begins its season on Friday and is ranked 10th nationally in the AP poll, its highest preseason ranking since the 1974-75 season.
The complaint stated that around July 7, Dawkins spoke over the phone with Merl Code, an Adidas executive also arrested in the sting, about which coaches could be convinced to take part in the corruption ring. 
“You going to introduce him to Tony Bland,” Dawkins said in the call, referring to a man who would turn out to be an undercover FBI agent. 
Steve, we should be OK if Andy can prove that he knew nothing about Bland’s scam.
