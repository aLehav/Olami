Remember the summer of 2008, when gas averaged more than $4 a gallon, when the price of a barrel of crude was $145, and when analysts were predicting oil prices to rise even further?  Does the recent rise of oil prices above $100 a barrel – and talk of prices climbing further – make you worry those days are but a few weeks away?  Well they’re not, so don’t worry.  The civil unrest occurring in North Africa in recent weeks – first a coup in Tunisia and now continuing protests in Egypt – has unnecessarily driven the cost of oil up.  Oil isn’t the only commodity fallen victim to a steep rise in prices – food prices have also spiked particularly sharply in recent weeks.
In the case of oil, speculators have made their dubious presence felt once again, conflating Suez Canal traffic and Sumed pipeline capacity with indigenous Egyptian oil supply.  Egypt is but a minor player in the global oil export game – it actually imports a portion of its oil consumption.  But markets worry that somehow the risk from uprisings in Cairo will cause events to occur that restrict the canal’s capacity some 70 miles of desolate desert away.  These worries of supply risk are, at best, “overblown.”
Analysts have predicted the likelihood of a major interruption to trans-Egyptian oil flow as “unlikely” and, despite two disruptions at Egyptian ports last week, prices have begun to decelerate their rise and – on some indices – begin to fall.  Despite continuing unrest, and the ardent desire of President Hosni Mubarak to remain in office until the next election in September, oil prices should not rise significantly.  If a major price surge does occur, it will occur more as a result of OPEC’s unwillingness to increase production in the face of rising global demand than a result of Egyptian civil unrest.

The Educational Testing Service’s Graduate Record Examination will now be four hours long, and there will be changes in each section to increase the accuracy of percentile rankings. The changes will affect anyone who takes the test after Aug. 1.
The current test, which is three hours long, will be changed to a four hour long test to assess one’s endurance and stamina. The types of questions on the verbal and quantitative sections have changed.
Lee Weiss, director of graduate programs for Kaplan Test Prep, said the new test corrects many flaws with the current version.
Weiss said the biggest reason for the changes is an issue with the scoring scale. Currently, a perfect score on the math section only puts a student in the 94th percentile, while a 730 out of 800 on the verbal section puts a student in the 99th percentile.
Weiss said students should sign up for the GRE soon if they wish to take the current version before the test changes.
“This is the only time in the history of the test where you have an option between which version you want to take, so we want to make sure students know about that,” Weiss said. “If they want to take the current test, time is running out to do so.”
The verbal section will include in-context vocabulary questions to test reasoning as opposed to questions on analogies and antonyms. The quantitative section will include less geometry, but more data analysis and a short answer section.
Students will also be allowed to skip questions and return to them later on during the test. Cara Murayama, a senior majoring in public policy, planning and management who took the GREs in November 2010, said she wished she had this option.
“Sometimes I would just guess because I would think I didn’t have enough time,” Murayama said.  “You never know if the next ones were going to be harder and if I needed to spend more time on them.”
Currently, the test is set on a 200- to 800-point scoring scale in 10-point increments. The revised test will be on a 130- to 170-point scale in one-point increments.
According to Shayna Kessel, a pre-graduate school adviser at the USC Office of College Advising, graduate schools are relying on test scores for admission more than ever.
“It concerns me that the days of being able to seriously consider and admit the total student seem to be coming to an end in many programs,” Kessel wrote in an e-mail. “I’m also concerned that genuinely talented, qualified students will find themselves essentially locked out of good graduate programs if they can’t manage to do very well on the GRE.”
Robert Rueda, a professor at the Rossier School of Education, said he does not think standardized tests evaluate everyone fairly.
“We get some people whose first language isn’t English that are otherwise competent students, and they tend not to do as well on standardized tests,” Rueda said. “In general, it’s just not predictive.”
Instead, Rueda said he would be in favor of tests that evaluate writing ability like reacting to research articles.
According to Weiss, many schools do not yet have a transition plan for comparing scores of the new test to the old one. When the new test scores are released in November 2011, ETS will provide a concordance table to compare the scores between both versions.
There will be a free version of the current GRE offered online at www.kaplantest.com today at 4 p.m. Anyone who takes this will be e-mailed links to practice for the new GRE.

Undergraduate Student Government campaign season officially began at 12 a.m. today.
Candidates will spend the next two weeks reaching out to students in hopes of becoming the next president or being elected to the Senate.
The elections will determine the next USG president and vice president, who will run as one ticket.
The elections will also determine the three Greek senators, the three commuter senators and the six residential senators for the 2011-12 school year.
The three presidential tickets are sophomores Eric Burse, current president of the Black Student Assembly, and Andy Greos, USG Program Board production director; juniors Alex Fadil, the executive vice president of the judicial board of the Interfraternity Council, and Rohan Mehra, a current fraternity president; and junior Monish Tyagi, USG director of Campus Affairs, and sophomore Logan Lachman, a Greek senator.
The 20 senatorial candidates include 12 Greek candidates and eight candidates vying for residential seats. The three commuter senators will be write-in candidates, so they will not be eligible for public funding or have their profiles on the USG elections website.
The competition for Greek senator, a position three people ran for last year, will be more intense because of the large number of candidates.
This year, the Elections Code, which sets guidelines for campaigns, added the option of public funding and altered the rules for campaign endorsements.
“Last year’s election was pretty good — there weren’t any major problems so the changes we made were minimal,” said USG Elections and Recruitment Co-Chair Juan Orjuela.
Presidential and Vice Presidential tickets can now be reimbursed for up to $625 of the $1,500 they are allowed to spend. Senatorial candidates can be reimbursed for up to $50 of their $300 spending limit.
Organizations used to be able to endorse as many candidates as they wanted, but are now limited to one presidential ticket and three commuter, three Greek and six residential senators.
Any organization can endorse one presidential ticket, but it is up to the candidates to publicize their endorsements.
In past elections, the average number of votes is 4,500, but USG is aiming for 6,000 this year, Orjuela said. This would represent more than one-third of USC’s undergraduates.

Milkshakes, dim lighting and student performances are just a few of the highlights of the Ground Zero Performance Café, where the new student orientation socials have been held for the past three years. For the next generation of Trojans, however, the social will be moved to Tommy’s Place, and some students aren’t happy with the change.

Ground Zero served as a temporary location for the social while the Ronald Tutor Campus Center was under construction. The Topping Student Center hosted the event before it was torn down.
“We will be moving the social back to Tommy’s Place,” said Thomas Studdert, director of orientation. “Tommy’s Place has always been tradition and all we are doing is moving the social event back to its original location.”
Some students, however, have developed a sense of attachment to Ground Zero. This sentiment has led Ari Oh, Ground Zero’s coffee bar manager, to start a petition to maintain the location of the orientation’s social event.
“It is part of the USC experience,” Oh said. “The petition was created to show support for Ground Zero.”
Jessica Roldan, a freshman majoring in biology and psychology, said she is upset that the event is being moved to Tommy’s Place.
“I like Ground Zero’s atmosphere, it kinda gives you a hang-out spot,” Roldan said. “Tommy’s Place isn’t really a place to hang out, it’s just an event spot.”
Some students find Ground Zero to be more suitable for new students to meet one another.
“I feel that Ground Zero is more loungey, chill and comfortable,” said Madison Klinghoffer, a sophomore majoring in international relations. “I’d probably be more comfortable at Ground Zero because Tommy’s Place seems more like an awkward room.”
Organizers hope to obtain 1,000 signatures from the many students who feel connected to Ground Zero, but so far only 102 have been secured.
“USC will certainly give consideration to students’ opinion if all 1,000 signatures are obtained, but the decision to make the location change has already been finalized,” Studdert said. “We will consider what our current students want, but it is about what our future students need.”
In the past, the social featured a DJ and a dance. The new student orientation social will now be run by USC Spectrum and will offer a variety of shows. Depending on their orientation session, students will see anything from a club atmosphere, a comedy show or a music performance, according to Studdert.
Laura Rodrigues, a freshman majoring in architecture, said the orientation event should stick to the same format because it is a good environment to meet other new students.
“Whether or not the event is at Ground Zero, the theme should be the same because dancing lets you bond with people, while watching a performance distracts you from meeting new friends,” Rodrigues said.
Some students worry about what will become of Ground Zero when new students are not officially introduced to the venue the moment they set foot on campus.
“I don’t care if they move it,” said Cristina Stan, a sophomore majoring in international relations and economics. “But I love Ground Zero, so I think it would suck for them to lose money from freshmen not buying milkshakes since it is out of the way and hard to stumble upon.”
Some seniors think that despite the appeal of Ground Zero, it is not the best venue to hold orientation events.
“I don’t think it matters if the orientation social is at Ground Zero or Tommy’s Place,” said Daniel Kim, a senior majoring in biology. “For my orientation they took us to explore L.A. Location doesn’t matter, but the events should let you interact and build long lasting relationships.”

Last weekend, the USC women’s swimming and diving team fell to California and Stanford in two consecutive dual meets.
The men’s team traveled to Northern California on Friday hoping to avoid a similar fate, but the Trojans lost to both Cal, 160-133, and Stanford, 162-116.
One more shot · Despite weekend losses, USC will have another chance to face Cal and Stanford at the Pac-10 diving championships. - Daily Trojan file photo 
The No. 8 Trojans (6-3) faced the No. 1 Golden Bears on Friday, and though the team had a few key victories, they were not enough to take home a win.
Two key USC swimmers in the Cal dual meet were senior diver Steven Starks and sophomore Charlie Charlesworth, who won two events each.
Starks won both the one- and three-meter diving events, while Charlesworth won the 500 and 1000-yard freestyle.
Senior Clement Lefert also placed second in the 500-yard freestyle.
“We weren’t really expected to win [against Cal], but we could have put up a better fight,” said senior co-captain Dillon Connolly. “We took a lot from it.”
The day following their loss to Cal, the Trojans went up against the No. 2 Cardinal hoping to salvage the trip, by earning a split.
USC sophomore Alex Lendrum was a force to be reckoned with on Saturday against Stanford, winning the 100-yard backstroke, 200-yard backstoke and 200-yard IM for the Trojans.
Despite Lendrum’s performance, however, Stanford proved to be too much to handle.
The Cardinal placed two of its swimmers in the top three in 11 of the 12 events of the meet and broke a pool record in the 200-yard free relay.
USC coach Dave Salo, who went up to face the two Northern California teams with the Women of Troy last weekend, as well, acknowledged some of the issues USC faced against both teams.
“Stanford was a meet that had  we been just a little bit tougher at the end of races we might have pulled out a win,” Salo said. “We matched up with them pretty well, but like Cal, we let a few races get away from us and let Stanford defeat us with momentum.”
The Trojans are optimistic that they will do better at the Pac-10s with some preparation.
“We have a few weeks to prepare for the Pac-10 championships and we need to take care of the little mistakes if we want a chance at challenging for a top three team finish,” Salo said.
Senior co-captain Emmett Walling said he is happy with the team as a whole, even if it didn’t win this weekend.
“I’m super proud of the team. Just keeping our spirits up throughout the Stanford meet was our biggest strengths,” Walling said. “And I think that’s what makes a championship team, keeping our spirits up when things aren’t going our way.”
The next time the USC swim and dive team competes will be at the Pac-10 Diving Championships on Feb. 24 and then at the Pac-10 Swimming Championships in March.

In middle school, I came home one evening in the midst of a chronic shoe phase, when, for strange, stupid reasons, most adolescent boys become enamored with $150 Nike sneakers.
It was wintertime, and an EastBay catalogue had been delivered in that day’s mail, packaged between utility bills and awkward postcards from relatives whose names still escape me.
I flashed the catalogue in my mom’s direction, but almost immediately, she continued with her normal routine after casting me a quick glance at me that couldn’t have amounted to more than a spare second.
I never got those hightops.
You see, the shoes were supposed to make me fast. They were supposed to give me the speed needed to become a coveted three-sport letterman in high school, who all college programs would subsequently drool over.
It didn’t work out that way. I’m still scouring for the right pair.
National Signing Day proved to be a sobering reminder as to what I missed out on.
While I was dozing off in lecture, 17-and 18-year-old high school football players were faxing letters of intent to college programs nationwide; some even making highly publicized and, in some cases, televised announcements of what school they would attend.
Again, if I had the shoes, I would have been one of Rivals.com’s prized five-star recruits. Still, everybody else seems to be getting the attention these days.
Offensive tackle Cyrus Kouandijo from Hyattsville, Maryland, received hundreds of Facebook notifications from Alabama and Auburn fans attempting to sway him to sign with their schools of choice. One day, the girl from my English class posted on my wall, wishing me a happy birthday.
Last week, Kouandijo also received 2,500 text message in a span of 24 hours — likely from Alabama and Auburn fans, as well. Usually, my mom sends me texts; they often read: “how r u?”
Jadeveon Clowney, the No. 1 overall recruit according to Rivals, is predicted to be “all-conference multiple times.” I’m still trying to think of anyone who has ever predicted me to be “all-anything.”
When once-USC-commit De’Anthony Thomas visited Oregon on a recruiting trip, he spoke with multiple University of Oregon and Nike officials. When I shop at a Foot Locker, I’m lucky if I can find a guy in a referee t-shirt.
Georgia running back prospect Isaiah Crowell announced his decision to sign with Georgia live on ESPNU, while holding a bulldog puppy. Of course, I’ve always longed to commit to a college football team (say USC), with the school’s mascot (say Traveler) by my side.
And remember, no matter what school any of these players commits to, he’ll be greeted by hundreds of fans and passersby, who say either “Roll Tide,” “Hook ‘em” or “Fight on.” Sometimes, I get a head nod from a freckle-faced engineering kid outside the library.
But you know, maybe all the attention isn’t a good thing. Just maybe, the bright lights, constant praise and total disregard for privacy are the culmination of a process that has not only become an over the top, self-promotional celebration for high school players but also, potentially even more damaging, has become an event that brings out the worst in fans.
When Thomas spurned USC for Oregon after eight months of being committed to the Trojans, he quickly became the subject of multiple message boards posts suggesting the Los Angeles native was lured north because of Nike’s sphere of influence.  In other words, fans speculated that the Ducks had bought the Crenshaw tailback, and in turn, he had turned his back upon his friends, family, and of course, USC.
Thomas offered a simpler explanation at a press conference announcing his signing:
“I felt comfortable in Eugene,” he said.
For better or for worse, Thomas, much like Kouandijo and others, has become so highly sought-after these days that he has become a mini-celebrity, driving fans to the point of madness.
For perspective, Kouandijo is a 17-year-old high school senior, and in the days centering around his decision to pick a university to attend, thousands of people living thousands of miles away sent him messages in an attempt to sway him to a certain school. He’s never met any of them.
It’s only fair to wonder whether such attention is particularly healthy to begin with. A majority of the messages received weren’t exactly welcoming either.
In the moments after faxing his letter of intent to Alabama on Saturday, hundreds of fans took to Kouandijo’s Facebook wall, to vent their frustration over the offensive lineman’s decision to turn down a scholarship offer from reigning BCS national champion Auburn. One post read “Boys need people to make decisions for them. Men know how to make their own decisions. You, my friend are a boy.” Another put it more plainly: “Go Die.”
Maybe it was best that I never got those shoes.

I’m glad you didn’t get the shoes – otherwise I would had missed out on a good article

The USC men’s tennis team welcomed a familiar face in former coach Brett Masi on Friday, and it wasted no time in showing how far they’ve come without him.
The No. 2 Trojans (6-0) notched their sixth consecutive win to begin the season with a 6-1 victory over No. 47 San Diego.
Youth served · Freshman Ray Sarmiento helped keep the Trojans’ undefeated streak alive by winning his sixth-straight singles match. - Mannat Saini | Daily Trojan 
Doubles play didn’t start off well, though, as freshman Ray Sarmiento and junior Steve Johnson, playing at the No. 1 spot for USC, was the only doubles pair to fall, losing to the Toreros’ Dean Jackson and Patrick Pohlmann, 8-3.
But sophomore J.T. Sundling and senior Jaak Poldma were dominant in doubles at the No. 3 spot, grabbing a win against San Diego’s Clarke Spinosa and Thibaut Visy, 8-3 to even the score.
“We started really quickly, which was nice,” Sundling said. “We were up 5-0, which really helped us, and it’s always good to start strong.”
Although Sundling and Poldma easily won their doubles match, junior Daniel Nguyen and freshman Emilio Gomez eked out an 8-6 victory over San Diego’s Nikola Bubnic and Nils Schive.
With a 7-6 advantage, Nguyen stepped up to the service line for the Trojans.
Nguyen and Gomez fought off a push by the Toreros pair to deuce, as Nguyen held serve and grabbed the doubles point for USC with one last ace to give USC a 1-0 advantage.
“We got up early in the break, but played really badly down the stretch,” Sarmiento said. “We need to work on better first serves and closing out the point.”
The Trojans had a much tougher time in the doubles department, but their singles matches went smoother.
“Steve [Johnson] and Jaak [Poldma] played so well and were in control,” said USC coach Peter Smith. “They really led the team, which was great to see, especially at the No. 1 and No. 2 spots.”
Johnson defeated San Diego’s Jackson 6-3, 6-2 and Poldma beat Bubnic 7-5, 6-1.
In an abbreviated third set, Nguyen, who lost the first set 2-6, came back with a 6-3 second set victory and pulled out a thrilling tiebreak deficit victory.
Sarmiento came away with his sixth consecutive singles victory with a 6-2, 7-5 decision over San Diego’s Clarke Spinosa.
Though the win might have seemed easy just looking at the stats, San Diego’s play told a whole different story. USC was challenged early in doubles play, before rattling off three-straight singles victories to close out the win at home.
Sarmiento said he was not surprised by the level of competition San Diego brought, and that USC welcomes the challenge.
“We have to expect that every match is going to be a battle,” he said. “We have to work hard and always have to prove ourselves.”
USC welcomes Pepperdine to Marks Stadium on Friday at 1:30 p.m. for its next match.

Looking to avenge their 61-42 loss to No. 9 UCLA on the road earlier in the season, the USC women’s basketball team came out scoring at a much faster pace on its home court Sunday.
But the end result was the same, as the Women of Troy dropped their fourth straight game to their crosstown rivals, 74-67.
Not enough · Coming off the bench, senior guard Jacki Gemelos finished with a team-high 16 points Sunday, but the Women of Troy were once again outdone by their crosstown rivals. The loss drops USC to .500 on the year in conference play. - Tim Tran | Daily Trojan 
“It was a heck of a basketball game. UCLA proved why they’re the No. 10 team in the country,” said USC coach Michael Cooper. “I have to commend our team, these young ladies were playing their hearts out. If nothing else, we made [UCLA] shake a little bit.”
The game marked the fourth loss for the Women of Troy (13-8, 5-5) in their last five games, and their second straight at home.
The teams traded baskets throughout most of the first half, with three lead changes and four ties.
With the score deadlocked 14-14 with 9:53 remaining in the first half, it looked as though it would be a defensive battle between the Pac-10 foes.
But both teams started a flurry of scoring before halftime.
The Bruins (19-2, 9-1) relied on offensive rebounding and second-chance points to stake out a 37-33 halftime lead.
Senior guard Darxia Morris and junior forward Jasmine Dixon both scored well above their point per game averages, with Morris (12.5) scoring 24 points while Dixon (12.1) chipped in 23.
Dixon briefly left the game with 2:23 remaining with a shoulder injury.
But she returned before halftime, laying in a basket with less than a minute remaining to give the Bruins their largest lead of the game, 37-29.
“[Dixon] is a solid post player. She works hard for every point she gets.” said USC junior guard Ashley Corral.
But the Women of Troy managed to keep up with their rivals, forcing a couple of turnovers in the final minute of the first half to close the deficit to 37-33.
UCLA came into the game with the better statistical defense, but USC forced the Bruins into 17 turnovers in the game while committing only 14 of their own, most of which came in the last few minutes of the game.
“Once we got across half-court, we handled their trap [defense],” Corral said. “I didn’t think their pressure affected us a whole lot. I thought we did a lot better [than last time].”
Senior guard Jacki Gemelos led the Trojans in scoring with 16 points, and kept USC within striking distance throughout the game.
“I just found the open gaps and took my shot when it was open,” Gemelos said.
Gemelos converted her third three-pointer of the game early in the second half to bring her team within one point, 45-44.
She finished with a team-high 16 points off the bench.
After that, the teams traded scoring runs. The Bruins went on a 12-4 run to gain their largest lead of the game.
But the Women of Troy refused to collapse, responding with a 12-5 run to close the deficit to 62-60 with 3:56 remaining in the game.
But the Women of Troy couldn’t quite regain the lead. With more than a minute remaining, UCLA collected a crucial offensive rebound while up 66-62.
“When you play a top-10 team, it’s about the little things,” Cooper said. “Obviously, the way we were outrebounded [37-25] didn’t help.”
USC junior guard Briana Gilbreath fouled Bruin guard Doreena Campbell, who calmly converted both free throws.
The Trojans turned the ball over on their next two possessions, nailing their own coffin and sealing the game for the Bruins.
The Women of Troy now sit at fifth place in the Pac-10, half a game behind Arizona State and California, which own 6-5 conference records.
USC continues the second half of conference play with trips to Oregon and Oregon State next week.

USC  often shows great concern for the well-being of its students, but the university seems to have focused mainly on physical health and neglected to consider students’ mental health, which has been a growing concern at colleges across the United States.
Cindy Lee |Daily Trojan
According to “The American Freshman: National Norms” Fall 2010 annual survey, freshmen emotional health has fallen to a 25-year low, with an almost unprecedented number of students reporting that they are “below average” in emotional health and “overwhelmed” by stress. And as students near graduation, stress levels only increase.
Sometimes, tragic events prompt students to seek personal counseling from USC. The mental health of students, however, should not be reserved for these instances.
On a daily basis, students are subjected to a crushing load of stresses, be it from academics and career hunting to extracurricular obligations and personal life concerns.
A four-chapter chemistry midterm tomorrow conveniently coincides with the due date for an eight-page WRIT 140 paper. Your significant other’s surprise birthday dinner occurs the night before a huge blood drive you are in charge of organizing.
And before you even have time to catch your breath, it’s finals week and crunch time again. According to an Associated Press and mtvU study in 2009, 85 percent of college students reported feeling stressed on a daily basis.
As Jackie Ayers, former president of the American College Health Association, noted, “Some of the most common mental health problems we see on our campus these days are depression, stress/anxiety disorders, relationship issues, alcohol and drug use, [and]sleep difficulties.”
While USC’s reputation has improved, so has the numbers of students stressed about grades. Stress over academics compounds into intrapersonal stress and self esteem issues, such as feeling out of your league and fearing failure.
Following the highly publicized suicides at Cornell University in March 2010, many universities have taken measures to increase mental health awareness.
USC Student Counseling Services has its own network of mental health sessions, including both individual and targeted group counseling focused on areas such as “Peace with Food and Body Esteem” and “Attention Deficit Disorder Support.”
Although individual counseling does seek to address  students’ concerns, it remains stigmatized and is not seen as a viable option for many students who feel as though they “don’t need a shrink.”
The university should implement more subtle means of stress relief methods throughout the year, not just during finals week.
The University of Missouri created the Stressbuster program, which trains students to give massages and help each other decompress.
Other universities hand out pamphlets with stress-relieving tips and have free yoga classes out on the grass or “Stress-Free Week” filled with bounce houses and breathing exercises.
Sigma Delta Alpha, a Latino interest fraternity at USC, brought puppies for students to play with during last semester’s finals week. Simpler gestures spaced throughout can make a meaningful difference.
Hopefully, we can re-prioritize the mental well-being of USC students.

Thank you for this article.  Our sophomore son was suffering from severe stress which we didn’t pick up on until the winter break.  He didn’t feel comfortable asking for help from his advisor, professors or anyone at the counseling services. Our family lives on the East Coast, so it was difficult to know about the state of his emotional well being until we saw him in December.  Now that we have taken emergency steps, with the help of our local professionals and the cooperation of counselors at USC,  he is doing better managing his stress, and we feel he has support–but he has to seek it out.  It is difficult being a parent of someone over the age of 18 because we aren’t in the position to step in when there is a problem.  I wonder if there can be a stronger effort on the part of USC to encourage students to have an emotional check-in-either with their advisor or someone on the counseling staff. Our son managed to avoid meeting his advisor for the entire first semester and communicated with him only by email.  That really isn’t right, and it should have been a waring sign.
This is a good article regardless of the authors  class level, as it brought light to an area otherwise shrouded in darkness.  My son struggled with stress his first two years at USC.  When he sought out counseling from the Mental Health Center, the support and services were severely lacking.  It wasn’t until he returned home during the summer and went into counseling did he progress. If anything, as a freshman, the author is undoubtedly much more intune to this issue than upper classmen.  Many upper classmen have either figure out a way to deal with it, dropped out due to the stress (and lack of progress) or have grown acustomed to the stress.
Richard, stop stagin’…
I give the author props for writing this article; never mind she’s a freshman. I think the message is important, one that should resonate more throughout the school: A sound mind makes for a sound body.
and what statistics do you have to back up these claims? how are you extrapolating the results of a national study to USC? and why is a FRESHMAN writing this article — clearly not enough experience to make such clams about the university’s “lack” of mental health programs….

Intellectual property is becoming the greatest renewable resource of our age.
A relatively obscure topic often relegated to the noble few who spend their years at law school pouring over infringement cases and writing claims, intellectual property law consists of patents, copyrights and trademarks, which protect an inventor’s rights to profit from his creation.
Innovation has been incentivized since day one. The seeds of success were sown in the Constitution, with the inclusion of a well-defined intellectual property law. The activity of a country’s patent system is a telling (though imperfect) indicator of overall economic health.
The top three countries in terms of patent filings are Japan, the United States and South Korea. Emerging markets like Brazil, India and China have also seen a sharp increase in the number of patents filed over the last decade.
The concentration of wealth that was once measured in tangible assets now is largely measured in intangible assets.
In an age when value is contained in formless ideas, designs and technologies, one can understand why a system that protects the exchange and use of such value is of crucial importance.
The long-neglected intellectual property system has finally inched its way onto policymaker’s radars. The President even referenced patents in his State of the Union address.
The U.S. patent system is far from perfect. The entire process, from the filing of a claim to granting the patent, takes an average of 32 months.
Patent litigation has seen a whopping 230 percent increase over the last 20 years, according to the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office.
In an interlinking global economy, one country’s problem cannot be cured in house anymore.  Intellectual property reform must be a global event.
Intellectual property theft is still a subject of some rancor between the United States and China, though China’s leaders are taking steps to combat the deep-rooted piracy.
China has the second largest market for computer sales, but ranks a lowly eighth in software sales.  Some point to this as evidence that many Chinese citizens might be illegally downloading software.
There has still been some progress. Software piracy rates have fallen since 2005 (66 percent in 2005 to 47 percent in 2008), according to a 2010 report released by Chinalabs.com, a company commissioned by China’s State Intellectual Property Office.
But the problem is nowhere near a solution, and was a subject of discussion when China’s President Hu Jintao visited the White House last month.
The bottom line: Innovation plus protection equals prosperity.
Governments around the world are beginning to understand the importance of building a strong  intellectual property system.
Likewise, business leaders and innovators must understand the importance of building a solid and diversified patent portfolio, not just in the United States, but overseas.
Jordan Lee is a sophomore majoring in broadcast journalism and Chinese . 
China’s Patent System is indeed a Joke. I was thinking more of the European Union Patent
Office. US is about the only County which gives priority to “first to invent”. The Majority of other
countries have “first to file”. Right Or Wrong? There are merits for both sides.
The current 35USC102 is very convoluted.
align US Patent Law more w/ other countries…comment
As noted in the article, China’s patent system is a joke. Why would we want to copy theirs? Rather, they should be aligning theirs with ours. Think again.
Good Article. Is the situation more Geo-Political Than Legal?
BTW US Senate Bill S.23 has come out of Judiciary Committee.
It is tough reading, I am just going through it. It may align US Patent
Law more w/ other countries.

The new 3-D film from Alister Grierson and James Cameron concerns an attractive bunch of spelunking junkies who must squeeze and swim their way out of the South Pacific’s Esa-ala cave system after a tropical storm submerges the main entrance.
Down under · Sanctum presents stereotypical stories and a typical narrative. The setting also fails to make the film’s actual location clear. - Photo courtesy of Universal Pictures 
I’d like to think everyone responsible for Sanctum was wise enough to understand the picture’s limitations as a work of amusement. After all, patrons of Splash Mountain are not treated to an animatronic history of Brier Bear’s education and paternal estrangement. They hop in the boat, go down the chute and get soaked.
Instead, we are spared the gratification of cheap thrills and given a disposable father-son story that just happens to be set in a water tank. Josh (Rhys Wakefield) is a young Australian hunk who spends his time rock climbing and ferrying supplies to his distant, cave diver dad, Frank (Richard Roxborough).
We first meet Josh en route  to the film’s caves, accompanied by American billionaire and expedition financier Carl Hurley (a dreadful Ioan Gruffud) and his dishy girlfriend, Victoria (Alice Parkinson).
Naturally, the three will wind up trapped, along with Frank, and are forced to deal with not only the usual bat droppings, stalagmites and subterranean pools, but also the company of each other.
Neil Marshall tried his hand at a similar setup with six young women and succeeded brilliantly in his 2005 creature feature The Descent.
But even before the monsters turned up, Marshall rendered the film’s granite halls, bottomless pitfalls and suffocating darkness almost unbearable to behold.
Grierson’s caves are grander in scale, but we never get a sense of just how deep beneath the earth we are. Though some might argue this disorientation is more akin to the true caving experience, I couldn’t shake the thought that after the ordeal, the film’s cast probably retired to a side room where hot towels, chicken dinners and mineral water awaited.
Part of the problem is the film’s pacing. Grierson gets us underground fast and floods the main tunnels before we’ve had a chance to look at them.
The reason for this, I suspect, is that the subterranean ceilings appear better in 3-D than the jungle above. Fair enough, but what the director does next is mystifying.
Instead of mercilessly exploiting his environment, Grierson takes us on a thumb twiddling journey through dark tunnels and the occasional submerged area, in the interest of mediating the characters’ frayed relationships.
Against all adversity, father and son grow inexplicably closer, as films of this melodramatic nature have taught us to expect.
That Grierson’s characters are hardly worth our interest doesn’t help. But even if their dilemmas were more thoughtfully realized and expressed, their exposition, slathered across the film’s midsection, belongs in the surface world.
The cave is where such exposition stands to be shaken up. As John Guillermin of The Towering Inferno and similar disaster pictures best demonstrated, it’s less important to have interesting characters than interesting ways to kill them off. Sanctum has neither.
Still, there is a good film waiting to be made about that perverse impetus that drives us to such unforgiving places in the Earth, beyond the conditioning of human compassion and reason. Werner Herzog took us there in Aguirre: The Wrath of God, with Klaus Kinski as our guide.
Though Sanctum’s Richard Roxburough lacks the German’s blinding spasms of madness, I occasionally found myself drawn to the former’s stubborn mass of obsession.
We never see Frank under sunlight, and get the sense that he might be immolated if ever brought back beneath its glare.
Unfortunately, that obsession is for another picture. Sanctum is not a successful character study or escapist thrill ride, but rather, another 3-D nail in the coffin of the filmed adventure.
The great blowhard Cameron appears to be wielding the hammer.
In theory, the director of Aliens and Titanic would be the ideal producer for a project like this, but if the capital exploits of Avatar seem to have convinced Cameron of one thing, it’s that completion lies solely in the exposed negative. We can only hope that Ron Jeremy’s next project won’t come with a pair of glasses.

When it comes to working out, sleeping or doing homework, the latter two usually take precedence.
But busy schedules shouldn’t be an excuse to skip exercise, especially when all it takes is a little daily tweaking. By incorporating some minor changes into your daily routine, you’ll soon be able to balance the chaos of student life with an improved healthy lifestyle.
You’ll be surprised at how easy these changes are. Even the busiest students have time to heed the following suggestions.
For the somewhat busy
If you’re busy but still have a reasonable amount of downtime, these tips are exactly what you need to start experimenting with a more concrete workout routine.
Wake up early
Your weekly routine might be exhausting, but those 11 a.m. classes aren’t early enough to deem morning workout regimens impossible. Waking up just an hour or two earlier than normal is sometimes all it takes to become more active.
What can you do in the morning to stay fit? If you’re looking for a relaxed and easygoing ritual, aim for the outdoors. Jogs are perfect in the crisp morning weather, and fewer people outside means less congestion in the streets and on-campus.
If you don’t know the area well enough or feel awkward running on campus around fellow students, try the simple, two-mile loop around campus.
Buy exercise videos
Not the outdoorsy type? No problem. If you’d rather spend your free time indoors, it’s a good idea to invest in a collection of workout DVDs. You can choose from an array of different activities, including yoga, pilates and belly dancing.  You don’t even have to throw on proper workout gear — just whip out a DVD and start moving.
If you’re strapped for cash, YouTube offers a variety of short and effective videos with great tips for staying active between study breaks.
Sign up for a local race
You don’t have to be a runner to enjoy 5K races. Signing up for a race a month or two from now will immediately inspire you to start fitting in training sessions around classes and other commitments. A long-term goal like a race is essential to finding the time to work out. Exercise isn’t all physical — the mental component is often just as difficult to overcome.
For the very busy
Sometimes setting aside time for exercise is next to impossible. If that’s the case, and you’re one of those constantly frazzled folk with no extra minutes to spare, these subtle tricks can work wonders.
Take the stairs, not the elevator
Got a class on the third floor? Instead of letting your finger do the walking in the push of a button, give your legs a chance to show their magic. The upward motion of climbing stairs will help tone your quadriceps, calves and glutes.
 Stretch in bed
If you can’t sacrifice sleep by getting up early, simply use the 10 minutes or so you normally spend hitting the snooze button to perform some early morning stretches. Start by moving your toes back and forth and slowly rotate different areas of your body, such as your ankles and wrists.
Once your body feels energized from the stretches, wake yourself up even more with a combination of sit-ups, push-ups and jumping jacks.
Walk everywhere, don’t bike
Bicycles are fast and convenient, but they also burn fewer calories in a single distance than walking.
The average person burns approximately 100 calories per mile when walking and only about half that number when biking. Unless you plan on biking long distances, walking is a better choice for staying fit and improving your stamina.
Opt for longer routes
Have an extra 10 minutes between classes? If you’re not in a rush, take a detour and start moving those legs.
Walking not only burns calories, but also reduces blood pressure and improves the heart and lung systems.
You can choose longer routes in almost any situation. If you’re headed to the grocery store, ditch the car and make a walking trip of it with a buddy. Or, if you’re going downtown to a mall or movie theatre, look for parking spots far away from the building entrances. View the extra distances as opportunities to raise your endurance levels.
Working out, no matter how busy you are, is something everybody can do. You just have to learn what works best for you and how you can incorporate little changes into your day-to-day life.

Who wants to share a room with Leighton Meester?
In The Roommate, the young actress, best known for her portrayal of Blair Waldorf in Gossip Girl, plays Rebecca, a college student and the realization of every freshman’s nightmare: the crazy roommate. But Rebecca is more than just a little crazy. 
She seems normal enough at first, but slowly begins to reveal her true psychotic colors as she becomes more and more obsessed with her roommate, Sara Matthews (Minka Kelly).
The Roommate is an inferior take on the standard thriller aimed at teenagers and 20-somethings. The characters are generic, the plot is unimaginative, the close-ups are cheesy and distracting and there is, of course, the obligatory shower scene, a predictable hallmark of the genre.
The film doesn’t just fail on its own merits, however. Director Christian E. Christiansen unrepentantly steals characters and plot ideas from Barbet Scroeder’s 1992 college chiller Single White Female. In other words, The Roommate borrows from a better film and fails anyway.
The story centers around the protagonist Sara, the pretty, sacharinely sweet, naïve small-town girl who dreams of becoming a fashion designer. The rest of the characterization is just as tame and tedious.
Rebecca is predictable in her obsessive derangement. Sara’s boyfriend, Stephen (Cam Gigandet), is the friendly frat guy in a sub-par band. Sara’s friend Tracy (Alyson Michalka) is the out-of-control party girl. Last but not least, there’s the one semi-perverted professor on campus, portrayed by Billy Zane.
Sonny Mallhi’s dialogue is another uncreative component of the film. The majority of it is fruitless chatter that manages to move the plot along.
But from the dorm rooms to the classrooms and the frat house, the dialogue sounds more like how imagined college students would speak, as well as pretentiously hip college professors.
The one element the movie happens to develop successfully is Rebecca’s character. Unsurprisingly, she provides all of the tension and conflict in the film. The scenes that have nothing to do with her are mere padding.
Meester portrays the sociopath decently, at least proving that she can act outside the realm of Gossip Girl. Meester is convincing in illustrating Rebecca’s loneliness and psychotic tendencies, proving that Rebecca is truly a disturbed person, an obsessive, selfish teenager who has yet to mature.
Unfortunately, the scenes that suggest Rebecca to be a potentially dangerous stalker are rendered comedic because of how inconceivably creepy she suddenly becomes.
The film also seems to wash its hands of the entire conflict at the end, which might feel cheap to some. One would expect a twist surprise at the finish, but The Roommate isn’t prepared to offer much in the way of surprises.
There is nothing particularly memorable about Christiansen’s film, except that a lot of it was filmed on the USC campus. It’s hard to miss the numerous shots of McCarthy Quad and the Parkside Arts & Humanities building, but then, the inclusion of these locales will only be of brief interest for people familiar with USC.
Ultimately, The Roommate is little more than a lackluster thriller that fails to leave any lasting impression on audience members, which is what’s most frustrating about it. It certainly isn’t the worst film of its kind — James Foley’s near unbearable Fear comes to mind ­— but possessing one or two cringe-worthy moments is not enough to assuage the fact that it’s bad in a way that makes it completely forgettable.
The suspense doesn’t work, and the plot and dialogue are brainless. The film is a mediocre backup plan for a Friday night when there’s absolutely nothing better to do.

“Some producers would say that there’s a benefit in taking a proven piece of material. You know it worked once, so it gives you some assurance that it will work again,” said respected film critic Leonard Maltin, who also teaches at the School of Cinematic Arts. “But I don’t think there are any rules [to adaptations], and there are just as many bad movies adapted from books and plays as there are good ones.”
Aaron Sorkin is honored at the 23rd annual Scripter Awards, hosted by the USC Libraries. | Daily Trojan
Yet last Friday, writers, producers and library patrons placed the “bad” aside for a night and celebrated the “good” at the 23rd annual Scripter Award. Hosted by the USC Libraries among the seemingly endless bookshelves of Doheny Library’s Great Hall, the Scripters recognize excellence in adapting a literary work while also fostering a discussion of collaboration between the publishing and film industries.
The Scripters have long been a rarity among the ceremonies held for filmmakers during award season. Unlike the Oscars, Golden Globes and WGA Awards, the Scripter Award, which is voted on by a selection committee composed of writers, actors and USC professors, not only recognizes the screenwriter of a filmic adaptation, but also the novelist, journalist or playwright of the original work on which the film was based.
According to Catherine Quinlan, Dean of the USC Libraries, there was a record-breaking 73 literary-to-film adaptations eligible in the 2010 calendar year, besetting 2009’s then-unprecedented 68 adaptations.
“People are looking more and more to the printed word as a source for inspiration. They’re realizing that jumping off from something like a poem or graphic novel or book gives you freedom in a constructed environment,” Dean Quinlan said. “Going back and looking at the source material gives you a chance to re-interpret the film.”
“I’m fond of the people who create things out of nothing, but adaptation is an art onto itself because you have to respect and keep the integrity of the original,” added Nancy Sinatra, who served as the master of ceremonies that evening. “I would imagine it’s even more difficult than thinking up your own, original idea.”
The 2011 Scripter Award was presented to The Social Network scribe Aaron Sorkin and novelist Ben Mizrech, who penned Accidental Billionaires: The Founding of Facebook, a Tale of Sex, Money, Genius and Betrayal, on which The Social Network was based.
Among the finalists for the award were 127 Hours, written by Simon Beaufoy and Danny Boyle, adapted from Aron Ralston’s memoir Between a Rock and a Hard Place; The Ghost Writer, which Roman Polanski based on Robert Harris’s novel The Ghost; the Coen Brothers’ True Grit, adapted from the novel by Charles Portis; and Winter’s Bone, written by Debra Granik and Anne Rosellini and based on Daniel Woodrell’s novel of the same name.
For Sorkin, seamlessly moving from one art form to another is second nature for the former playwright who initially set out to be an actor.
“It turned out that at all the classes at Syracuse [University], I wasn’t learning how to act but what a play was. And when I wrote dialogue for the first time, I was struck with a confidence that I never had as an actor,” Sorkin said.
Sorkin also credits his sharp ear for rapid-fire dialogue, which has become his signature in his films to his parents, who frequently took him to see plays in New York as a child.
“Sometimes, I didn’t know what the play was about but I loved the sound of dialogue. It sounded like music to me — the rhythm, the words crashing into each other. I wanted to imitate that sound,” he said.
Although The Social Network is something of a “talking head” film, heavily relying on language rather than weighty plot twists or big-budget explosions to engage the audience, Sorkin insists he had faith in director David Fincher to make his characteristically long dialogue sequences work.
“He’s an incredibly patient director who didn’t worry about, ‘What am I going to point the camera at for nine pages?’ He really believed that a scene was going to live on its own without any pyrotechnics … and that a story could be told through language,” Sorkin said.
Academy Award-winning screenwriter Simon Beaufoy — who returned to this year’s Scripter Award with 127 Hours, two years after winning for Slumdog Millionaire — also echoed Sorkin when discussing the trust writers must place within the hands of their directors and producers with Fox Searchlight’s president of production, Claudia Lewis.
“[127 Hours] must have been the least attractive pitch to a studio. You can imagine having these people who won eight Oscars and they come into the studio with what’s going to be next, and it’s a very difficult story,” Beaufoy said.
“But we were willing because it’s an extraordinary story,” Lewis added.
Beaufoy admitted he was hesitant when writer-director Danny Boyle first approached him with the idea to adapt Aron Ralston’s incredible true story of being trapped in a canyon, unable to move, for five days. Although he initially didn’t think the film could be done, Beaufoy claimed it was the power of Ralston’s fight for survival that intrigued him.
“There are very few studios backing stories that don’t fit into a genre and don’t do what everyone expects,” Beaufoy said. “But you have to be bold and go for what you think is fascinating.”

With the NFL draft roughly two months away, a handful of former USC standouts are one step closer to their dream.
Eight former football players have been invited to attend this year’s NFL combine, where scouts will have the opportunity to examine their skills on the field and decide whether they have pro potential.
These selected players are TE Jordan Cameron, RB Allen Bradford, OL Kris O’Dowd, CB Shareece Wright, FB Stanley Havili and WR Ronald Johnson. Juniors DT Jurrell Casey and OL Tyron Smith will also attend. Many experts predict Smith with be the first Trojan drafted this year.
Seven players from USC were drafted last year, including S Taylor Mays, DE Everson Griffen, RB Joe McKnight, and WR Damian Williams. Six others were later signed as unrestricted free agents.
The combine will occur in Indianapolis from Feb. 23 to March 1.
This year’s NFL draft will take place from April 28 through April 30 at Radio City Music Hall in New York City.

As awards season slowly leads to the cherry on top on Feb. 27, the Academy Awards, the WGA and ADG Awards, both held Feb. 5, show that nothing is certain until it happens.
Saturday night in the Renaissance Hollywood Hotel’s grand ballroom, Christopher Nolan’s psychological fantasy, Inception won the Writers Guild of America award for best original screenplay.
After going through a dry spell, Inception beat out favorites The Fighter and The Kids Are All Right which are also nominated for an Academy Award in the same category.

Although The King’s Speech is nominated for 12 Academy Awards, including best Original Screenplay, it failed to be nominated for the WGA award because it didn’t meet certain union requirements.
Award season favorite, Aaron Sorkin’s The Social Network based on Ben Mezrich’s book The Accidental Billionaires, won the trophy for best-adapted screenplay.
Across town that same night, at the Beverly Hilton Hotel, Paula Poundstone and production designer Eve Stewart hosted the 15th annual Art Directors Guild’s Excellence in Production Design Awards.
Contemporary feature Black Swan, fantasy feature Inception and period feature The King’s Speech divvied up the awards for feature films.
Although Therese DePrez’s work for the ballet thriller, Black Swan is not nominated for a corresponding Academy Award, both Inception and The King’s Speech are, along with Alice in Wonderland, Harry Potter and True Grit.
With only three more weeks to go until the climatic Academy Awards, the question is who will win the coveted gold statuette, the favorites or the sleepers?
