The Office of Student Affairs and several cultural resource centers hosted the kickoff of the #TogetherUSC campaign, which seeks to foster campus unity through mutual acceptance and care, on Tuesday.
Between noon and 1 p.m. in front of Tommy Trojan, administrators passed out informational brochures and cupcakes while students took pictures in a photo booth with posters that promoted an inclusive mindset, featuring slogans like “cultures are not costumes” and “I am more than a label.”
University officials want to make it clear that they are fully committed to campus equality.
“[#TogetherUSC] is about creating a ‘culture of care,’” said Lynette Merriman, assistant vice provost for student affairs, support and advocacy. “We want students … to feel safe [and] supported, and we want students to support one another.”
Merriman said #TogetherUSC is part of a larger effort by Student Affairs to increase awareness about existing on-campus resources available to support students’ physical and mental health, as well as to eliminate bias and prejudice. Billy Vela, director of El Centro Chicano, added that a main goal of the campaign is to provide students with the tools to help them support each other.
Trojans Care for Trojans, an initiative that allows students to request a staff member’s help when they are concerned about another student’s personal challenges, is one of the programs highlighted by #TogetherUSC. Bias reporting gives students the opportunity to report hate incidents so they can be further investigated by University officials.

“It’s great to see more concerted efforts to raise awareness about different identities,” Undergraduate Student Government President Rini Sampath said.
Sampath was especially pleased that #TogetherUSC is working with campus cultural resource centers such as Asian Pacific American Student Services, El Centro Chicano, the Center for Black Cultural and Student Affairs and the LGBT Resource Center. As these organizations are already working to address students’ issues with identity, diversity and acceptance, Sampath said it makes sense to include them in this campaign.
Sampath has been lobbying to pass the Diversity Climate Resolution that the USG senate voted to postpone on Tuesday. The resolution would provide cultural centers with additional funding and allocate more resources to addressing inclusivity.
Students who attended the event were highly supportive of the initiative.
Leslie Berntsen, a fourth-year doctoral student studying brain and cognitive sciences and social psychology, said she hopes the campaign will create “a culture of care rather than a culture of compliance.”

Others emphasized the theme of solidarity.
“We’re all one big family. People should be treated equally and fairly,” said Gor Mkrtchyan, a junior majoring in business administration. “I need to be more cognizant of the fact that my fellow Trojans aren’t always treated fairly. I need to help them in any way I can.”
Students can participate in the discussion on campus inclusivity via social media, using the hashtag #TogetherUSC.

Clarification: A previous version of this article stated that Leslie Berntsen applauded the campaign. Bernsten simply said she hoped the campaign would foster a culture of care.

Day of the Dead · The Latino Social Worker Caucus’s annual Dia de Los Muertos event centered around health issues facing the Latino community and ways that social workers can engage with members to build trust. – Iselin Arias | Daily Trojan
Before a room full of silent students, alumnus Martin Lopez Jr. blew four long, somber notes on a conch shell cupped in his hands. The sound signaled the start of the Latino/a Social Worker Caucus’s annual Dia De Los Muertos event, which took place Tuesday afternoon. The event focused on the disparity of health in the Latino community.
Lopez started the event with several traditional songs and explained the importance of connecting with the traditions of Latino heritage. He told the history of Dia De Los Muertos, a traditional Hispanic holiday celebrating the dead which is an integral part of Mexican culture.
After Lopez finished, student organization representative Iselin Arias introduced a panel of three speakers who specialize in the intersection between health and the Latino community. The panel included Patty Arias, a health specialist for the Pasitos Program; Jesus Diaz, a representative for California State Senator Ricardo Lara; and Lourdes Olivares, director of Behavioral Health at Bienvenidos Health Center.
Arias spoke about health concerns in the southeast Los Angeles community, where the Pasitos Program provides health care support and education to 500 children and their families. She said that in southeast Los Angeles, 97 percent of the population is Latino or Hispanic. Fifty percent of the children in that population are obese or overweight, and many more lack proper oral care.
The main concern that Arias noted is a lack of education in the low-income Latino communities that she interacts with. This ranges from uncertainty about how to take prescriptions to refusal to seek oral care. The Pasitos Program focuses on the education of both children and parents to combat this problem. Children learn how to develop habits such as brushing their teeth, while parents learn how to read nutrition labels, cook traditional meals in healthier ways and adjust daily eating and drinking patterns.
“Many parents aren’t aware why their child is overweight because they’re doing what they feel is proper,” Arias said. “That’s where we see a pattern, and that’s what we’re trying to fix.”
After Arias, Diaz spoke about the recent policies of State Sen. Ricardo Lara, who represents southeast Los Angeles and recently passed the “Health For All” act, which expands health care coverage to undocumented children in California. Diaz said that the senator saw a need for this bill after President Obama’s Affordable Care Act in 2010 did not offer coverage to undocumented immigrants.
Diaz said that the bill originally offered coverage to all undocumented immigrants, which Gov. Jerry Brown refused to accept. Lara and Brown compromised by providing coverage to the 170,000 undocumented children in California, which will create a $40 million increase in yearly Medi-Cal expenditures. Diaz said that the senator hopes to create further legislation that will expand this coverage to all undocumented immigrants. Diaz hopes that this effort will help undocumented immigrants build trust with their elected officials.
“These communities have been held in the shadows for a long time,” Lara said. “They’re very wary of government policies and elected officials. We need to make sure our families, our children and our communities know that not all politicians are bad politicians.”
Continuing with this theme of trust, Olivares spoke about the need for undocumented immigrants to seek medical care before it becomes an emergency. She pointed out that many undocumented immigrants will refuse to see a doctor until health problems become chronic. This is a pattern that she hopes to change at her center, which works to pre-screen and educate both documented and undocumented members of the Latino community.
“We must demystify the fear of going to the doctor,” Olivares said. “They won’t go because they’re undocumented, because they’re afraid they’ll call [immigration]. And that just doesn’t work, it isn’t safe.”
Olivares also focuses on treating mental health. She stressed the importance of social workers in this field. When a patient at her center is referred from a medical doctor to a mental health specialist, a social worker guides that patient through necessary and difficult steps toward treatment. Olivares also stressed the importance of Latino students remaining bilingual, as the increase for social workers fluent in Spanish and English increases.
“If you’re rusty on your Spanish, practice it at home,” Olivares said. “You are golden in these opportunities if you can relate to these people in their own language.”
At the conclusion of the event, each of the panelists received questions about a variety of topics — ranging from tips on choosing a specialty to advice on how to find care for an undocumented father — from the students in the room. Each of the panelists continued to stress the importance of focusing on the intersection between the Latino community and the health care industry, an intersection that each felt is both vital to the community and often overlooked.

The southern end of Magnolia Street was sealed off to the public Tuesday night after an officer-involved shooting took place south of Adams Boulevard at approximately 4:45 p.m. near University Park Campus.
According to Los Angeles Police Department Detective Meghan Aguilar, an altercation occurred after a traffic stop involving two LAPD officers in which a man in his thirties exited his vehicle with a knife and reportedly attempted to stab the officers on the scene. The officers responded with gunfire and shot the suspect, who remains in critical condition. The suspect and the officers, both of whom sustained non-life threatening injuries, were transported from the scene.
The preliminary investigation concluded that “there is no indication whatsoever” that any USC students were involved in the altercation.
Jonathan Miller, a senior majoring in human biology who heard the shooting from his home on the intersection of Magnolia and 27th Streets, said the first indication that something had occurred was a faint screeching sound, followed by sirens and the appearance of several ambulances and fire trucks.
“There was a lot of running, a lot of rushing by the police,” Miller said. “It was very, very fast.”
The LAPD’s Force Investigation Division, which handles all cases of officer-involved shootings, is currently investigating the incident.

As grateful as I am for Southern California’s beautiful 70 degree temperatures, the cozy knits and adorable leggings I see while online shopping have left me craving chillier weather. Luckily, my prayers have been answered with the Weekender right around the corner. This year we actually have a moment to breath and process that it is actually happening. Having it within the first few weeks of school last year left me scrambling for accommodations, rides and the perfect outfits. But, now that I am in midterm procrastination mode, I have had time to find some fall outfit inspiration. 
For the Drive Up
Whether you are getting to San Francisco via plane, car or bus, comfort is key during travel. Take advantage of fall’s sweatpant trend. Also don’t forget to layer up. You never know if air conditioning on the plane will be on full blast, or if your friend’s car will resemble a sauna. Options are important.
Urban Outfitters
 
Day-Time Exploring
For a day of adventuring around the city, keep it casual yet polished. A simple pair of jeans are the perfect match for a fun vest. Temperatures are going to feel like a crisp fall day, and this cozy vest is essential for dressing for mild fall temperatures. Throw on a pair of heeled booties to make your look more sophisticated. Just make sure they are comfortable as a lot of walking is going to be involved. 
Forever 21
 
Night Out
Nothing is more exciting than that first night out in the city. For this much needed break from house parties and fraternities, don’t be afraid to dress it up a little bit. This velvet romper is a sleek option. The long-sleeves adds contrast to the plunging neckline, and keeps your outfit from feeling like a stuffy holiday dress. If clubs are your move pair with big heels, but if bars are where you’ll be hanging out stick with heeled boots. 
Nasty Gal
Gameday
Get ready to experience tailgating in a completely new environment. Pull out your most obnoxious and warmest USC apparel to rep at this weekend’s rival, Cal. The bookstore is full of adorable sweatshirts and knit hats to pair with jeans. Also song girl skirts look surprisingly cute with tights and knee-high boots. 
USC Bookstore
 
Halloween Night
Now there is no way I could capture the endless possibilities for this night in a single write up. Some like to make Halloween a night of fantasy with crazy costumes, while some prefer to keep it low key. This year I’m gravitating toward a spooky black dress and some cliche cat ears. No matter what you decide, warmth for this night is key!
Asos
 
Final Brunch
Sadly, all good things must come to an end, but not before you’ve brunched! San Francisco has some of the best brunch spots in the country so before heading home treat yourself to Sunday funday. Keep it trendy yet cozy by pairing a jean skirt with printed tights. Depending on the weather, add a tank top or turtleneck into the mix.

Halloween is coming up, and in my opinion having the perfect costume is essential for a fantastic night of candy-fueled debauchery. Figuring out what to dress up as can be difficult, especially if you need multiple costumes, but I’m here to help. If midterms have gotten the best of you and you still haven’t decided what to wear on Saturday, check out my list. 
First things first, do not — I repeat — do not wear a costume that is racially charged. Cultural appropriation isn’t cute. If you even have to ask yourself if the costume you’re wearing is insensitive, ditch it for something else. 
“In Girl World, Halloween is the one night a year when a girl can dress like a total slut and no other girls can say anything about it.” While our resident mean girl Cady Heron may be right, wearing a sexy kitten costume is banal-AF. There will be plenty of other opportunities and theme parties for you to dress up as “Sexy [insert literally any animal, occupation, inanimate object].” Take Halloween as an opportunity to let your freak flag fly.  
Okay so now on to some DIY costume ideas that I have curated from the Internet: 
1. Sim 
The Sim costume is simple, hilarious and easy to execute.  All you’ll need to go out on the town dressed as a simulation from that strange and beloved computer game from your childhood, is make a headband with the green diamond thing (apparently the technical term is plumbob). You could also accessorize any costume with the plumbob, to create a costume within a costume inception effect. 
CRTL + SHIFT + C rosebud amiright?

2. Ms. Frizzle 
“Seat belts, everyone!” Dress as everyone’s favorite animated teacher this Halloween. You can easily make this a couple’s costume by coercing  a friend into agreeing to dress as the Magic School bus.
Courtesy of Tumblr
3. 1994 Olympic figure skaters Nancy Kerrigan and Tonya Harding
I’m a huge fan of highly specific references. Context: Nancy Kerrigan was clubbed in the knee after a practice session before the U.S. figuring skating championship. The attack was plotted by Tonya Harding’s ex-husband and some other dude so that she wouldn’t be able to compete. 
Courtesy of Tumblr
*Warning — going with a reference costume may make you feel inclined to provide background when people ask the unbearable, “What are YOU suppose to be question.” However, do not satisfy their inquiry, shhh it’s Halloween, you don’t need to explain.
4. Captain Planet and the Planeteers
While I love Scooby-Doo and the rest of the gang, shake it up and let your “powers combine” by going as the 90s, eco-conscious, magical ring-bearing teens, “The Planeteers” and superhero Captain Planet (the green mullet is a must).
Courtesy of Tumblr
5. Bob Ross
 
For those who don’t know, Bob Ross was an art instructor who had his own PBS show entitled “The Joy of Painting.” His soothing voice borders on unsettling, and this costume is sure to be a crowd pleaser. Similar to the Ms. Frizzle costume, this can easily be made into a group costume if you find friends willing to dress as Bob’s landscape paintings.  
6. Instagram
You will definitely get likes and comments on this costume. Make yourself a walking Instagram post and facilitate an opportunity for a super-meta post. 
Courtesy of Tumblr
7. Commercialize yourself  
I would advertise these costumes (yup, that pun was totally intentional) ensure your night of fun by going as Progressive Insurance’s Flo, Jake from State Farm,  Allstate’s Mayhem, Dos Equis’ Most Interesting Man in the World, or the Sundrop soda girl. 
Courtesy of Tumblr
8. Board Game
You can’t go wrong with dressing as the board games of your childhood. To complete this throwback look you can dress as Operation man, inappropriate Twister or if you need a group costume idea you can be the characters from Clue.  
Courtesy of Tumblr
9. Life Imitates Art
You don’t have to be an art history major to dress up as a famous work of art. Dress up as the Girl With The Pearl Earing or even Mona Lisa.
Courtesy of Tumblr
 
10. Carrie Mathison
Ladies, dust off those Ann Taylor Loft pants suits that have been buried deep within your closets since last year’s career fair and go out as protagonist and ex-CIA agent, Carrie Mathison from Showtime’s “Homeland.” To get the full effect, forge some CIA credentials, carry around empty pill bottles and run around the party asking where Saul and Quinn are — all while imitating the signature Claire Danes cry-face.
Courtesty of Tumblr
11. Ariana Grande’s Donut Scandal
Wear an oversized grey sweatshirt and carry around a box of donuts that you can occasionally lick throughout the night. To really channel your inner-Ariana Grande, you can make disparaging remarks about America and fat people all night long.
Courtesy of Tumblr
12. Shame Bell Nun
Add a layer of pop cultural context to the classic nun and friar costume.  Accessorize those habits with an added cowbell to complete the “shame nun” look featured in the last season of Game of Thrones.

via GIPHY
 
13. Soul Cycle Instructor 
This costume is relatively easy to pull-off; pull on some Lycra, and get one of those 90s pop star headsets. If you want to fully commit to this costume, don’t forget to scream mantras of positivity, love and acceptance at fellow partygoers.
Courtesy of Tumblr
14. Uber / Lyft
Want to be the personification of Uber? Print out the Uber logo, and put on a suit or simplify the costume by just wearing black. Convey the aesthetic of the international car service by carrying around a messenger bag filled with mint gum, water bottles, an auxiliary cord, and a portable charger for people’s phones.
To complete the Lyft look wear a pink wig, pink mustache and green clothes. Convey that friendly ride-share vibe by carrying around candy and offering fist bumps. Remember to  asking fellow partiers if the level you set the air conditioning is okay.

Finding housing year to year is a common source of stress for students. Deciding where to live while studying in another country can be even more difficult. While some study abroad programs provide housing for students, other programs require that students find their own arrangements. From dorms, to apartments to homestays, once you’re settled in it’s important to make your new room feel like home. Here’s how some of our bloggers are living around the world.

The Trojans have faced adversity all season, and despite a blowout win over No. 3 Utah, the Trojans continue to battle hardship, especially in the form of injuries.
The biggest blow to the Trojans came against Washington when senior center and captain Max Tuerk went down with a knee injury. He has since had surgery to repair the injured ligament and will now turn his focus to his recovery.
Sophomore guard Toa Lobendahn moved over to center to replace the injured captain. He played at center against Notre Dame and started at center against Utah only to be knocked out for the season with the same injury as Tuerk.
Redshirt junior Isaac Whitney is out indefinitely with a broken collarbone and is just one of three receivers battling injury. Redshirt sophomore Steven Mitchell Jr. has been battling an ankle injury and is listed as questionable for Saturday’s game against Cal, as is junior Darreus Rogers, who suffered a hamstring injury.
The thin receiving corps has been led by sophomore JuJu Smith-Schuster, who is fifth in the nation in receiving, averaging 128.7 yards per game. He has reached over 100 yards in five games this season. Fellow sophomore Adoree’ Jackson, a three-way starter, played almost exclusively on offense for the first time against Utah to add depth to the depleted receiver position.
Some good news came for the Trojans on Tuesday, though, as offensive lineman Chad Wheeler practiced for the first time after sitting out against Utah with a concussion.

Guarding Goff · Junior outside linebacker Su’a Cravens began preparing to face Cal quarterback and NFL prospect Jared Goff in practice on Tuesday. – Mariya Dondonyan | Daily Trojan
If USC wants to achieve its goal of a Pac-12 title, the Trojans cannot afford to lose another game. Consequently, the Trojans practice as if they’ve already put their impressive win against No. 3 Utah behind them, so they can focus on one thing — beating Cal.
“I told these guys that they inspire me. To come off of a big win and then to come out like they did today — there was no letdown,” interim head coach Clay Helton said after practice Tuesday. “It just looks like this team wants to keep getting better.”
USC will travel to face Cal, who will be playing in front of their home crowd after two losses to quality opponents, UCLA and Utah.
“We know what kind of game Cal is going to try to play because they are coming off of two losses,” said running back Justin Davis. “We’ve been in that position before, so we know they are going to be hungry, and they don’t want to go to three straight losses, so they are going to fight. We are going to have to match their intensity.”
Though the Trojans are excited about knocking off the No. 3 team in the nation, they haven’t wasted any time in preparing for their next game.
“We haven’t even spoken about Utah, besides Monday, because we’re on to Cal,” linebacker Su’a Cravens said. “Cal is a tough team that took Utah to the fourth quarter. We have to get ready to play because they’re a really talented team when they throw the ball.”
Unlike last week when the linebacker was asked to stop Utah’s run attack led by Devontae Booker, Cravens will have his hands full in pass coverage against Cal and their star quarterback, Jared Goff. Cravens, a converted safety, said he will be in coverage much more this week and is looking forward to the challenge of competing against the future pro.
“He is the captain of that team, and he’s the potential first pick of the board, so if we get the ball out of his hands and make them run the ball and make their receivers make a play, I think we have the best chance to win the game,” Cravens said.
Rather than being intimidated by Goff’s talent and his potential first-round status, Helton and the Trojans are excited to face such a talented quarterback.
“It is going to be so much fun. You’re talking about two NFL quarterbacks that are going to be on the field Saturday,” Helton said. “[Goff] has had this group of wideouts for a couple of years now, and you can tell that they are on the same page. He is releasing the ball before they are even near open, and he is hitting them unbelievably and with great accuracy. We have a huge challenge this week.”
Helton said quarterback Cody Kessler demonstrated a tremendous amount of poise in USC’s final drive against Utah last Saturday. Helton said that though time was running down and the offense was largely running the ball, Kessler’s timely completions to JuJu Smith-Schuster, which extended the drive, exemplify the benefits of having a fifth-year veteran.
“That is what you want in a senior quarterback,” Helton said. “Just the maturity and the poise that led a group of young men. His body language was great — there was no phase in him about his second center being down. I think he handled it incredibly well.”
Kessler, who threw for 264 yards and a touchdown, echoed Helton’s sentiments and acknowledged that he had gotten back on track after throwing two interceptions against Notre Dame.
“I got the ball where it needed to go,” Kessler said.  “We extended drives, we made huge third downs and we pushed the ball down the field a little bit. And the guys responded great.”
Sophomore Khaliel Rodgers started his first game Saturday as USC’s third center of the season due to injuries to Toa Lobendahn and Max Tuerk.
The return of left guard Chad Wheeler against Cal will be a huge addition for the line. Wheeler, who was out against Utah with concussion-like symptoms, practiced Tuesday.
“Rodgers did such a good job. He was thrown in there, and he came in and started making plays and really leading our group. It was really cool to see,” Kessler said.
Kessler stayed and worked on shotgun and under center snaps with Rodgers after practice Tuesday. But, Kessler said because he’s caught so many snaps, he’ll be able to adjust to whatever Rodgers is most comfortable with if he can continue playing like he did against Utah.
“I was able to jump right in. We practice it all the time,” Rodgers said.
Rodgers has primarily practiced as a guard since spring training but said offensive line coach and run game coordinator Bob Connelly rotates the linemen’s positions in practice, which has made the transition much easier. Consequently, he was less nervous, because he had already worked with Kessler in practices.
“I just grind in practice, and when they called my number, I wanted to go out there and execute,” Rodgers said. “The way they teach us, each lineman has to learn every position so they have got to be ready. When you prepare like we do, you don’t have any doubts. We just work so hard and execute everything in practice so that you expect to be perfect in the game.”
Rodgers added that he has relied on leadership from veterans such as Zach Banner, who preaches that physicality is essential in being the dominant offensive line unit that they’ve expected to be all season. USC’s line was notably active, aggressive and controlling against Utah’s front, which opened holes for running back Ronald Jones II.
USC rushed for 119 yards against Utah. Banner said that the offensive line’s performance was inspired to prove that they could play tough football. And that’s exactly what they love to do.
“Coach Connelly challenged us before the game and challenged me as a leader to be physical,” Banner said. “He challenged me during the game too. He said, ‘We need to make sure we keep going, keeping hitting, and don’t let them get complacent.’ So I brought the guys together, and I looked at them and I said, ’If we do this every single drive, we’re going to win the game.’”
Connolly is proud of how his team has handled being shorthanded and is optimistic about the coming games.
“They played very, very well versus a good football team,” Connelly said. “If you would have told me or asked me at the beginning of the year that we had beat Utah or the No. 3 team in the country — minus three starters on the offensive line and those starters being Chad Wheeler, Max Tuerk and Toa Lobendahn — I’d have told you you’re crazy. It’s extremely encouraging to me and to us.”

Without equivocation, I was rooting for USC this past weekend. My Trojan roots run deep, and I still believe anything is possible this season.
But there was a little — just a little — bit of me rooting for Utah coach Kyle Whittingham. There’s a small chance Whittingham becomes the next head coach of the USC team, and I was hoping his potential candidacy would remain valid with his continued success.
Much like a lot of Laker fans who adopted a #TankForWiggins approach to fandom while the Lakers were struggling so mightily, I guess you could have called Saturday a chance to #TankForWhittingham. It’s not like losing would have positioned USC better in an amateur draft, but it was a chance to evaluate one of the candidates getting the most attention in coaching rumors.
Regardless of Saturday’s loss, Whittingham probably won’t be making the jump to the Coliseum until the Utes’ next game here. But one could argue that Saturday’s game is just as indicative of the fact that Whittingham needs to make the jump to the Coliseum as it is that he isn’t ready for it.
Whittingham is a great head coach. He’s emerged as one of the most impressive program heads in the country this season with the meteoric rise of the Utes this season.
And no, meteoric is not an exaggeration. Yes, this was a very solid team last year, and I certainly haven’t forgotten about the two-minute drill the Utes used to get past the Trojans last year. But I don’t think anyone outside of Salt Lake City expected this year’s Utes team to be in the top half of the Pac-12 South division standings, let alone the top four as of last week.
USC obviously came into the season with a lot of hype. Many people expected UCLA to be another top team with highly touted quarterback Josh Rosen leading the offense and potential NFL first round draft pick Myles Jack leading the defense. Even Arizona and Arizona State made the AP preseason top 25 and were expected to compete for the conference title. Utah did get some votes in the poll, and the Utes certainly had higher expectations than Colorado. But nonetheless, this was a team that was expected to finish fifth — second to last — in the conference, and even after its worst game of the year, is still in first place in the standings.
In some ways, though, it shouldn’t be such a surprise that Utah has been playing so well this year because it has had some serious success in the last decade. The Utes have twice gone undefeated, in 2004 under Urban Meyer with Whittingham as the defensive coordinator and in 2008 under Whittingham as the head coach. Both perfect seasons included BCS bowl wins. Both of those seasons were before Utah switched into a Power 5 conference, but Whittingham and the Utes’ victory in the 2008 Sugar Bowl was over Alabama, who would win the national championship the following year.
Whittingham does have a lot of similarities to Meyer. He’s proven he can do a lot with a little. Despite the recent history, Utah still doesn’t have resources comparable to major programs with much more tradition, like Florida, where Meyer moved after 2004, or USC.
Meyer then proved that his success would translate against tougher competition and established himself as an elite college coach with two national championships. In fact, one of those national championships at Florida came in 2008, the same year Utah went undefeated but was left out of the BCS National Championship game — back in the day before we had the national playoff — while a    one-loss Florida and Oklahoma both made it.
Though Meyer is an obvious success story, making that kind of an offer is still a big risk. Just because someone can win with less doesn’t mean that success will translate against tougher competition, even with better recruiting or institutional resources.
Whittingham is at an unclear middle ground in his career. Utah has made it to a major conference and turned a team with no major success prior to the turn of the century into a legitimate national title contender. Though it hasn’t included an innovation in offensive theory or uniform style like Oregon’s, the product on the field has been almost as impressive — especially when Utah smashed an underachieving Oregon team this year. What’s unclear is if Utah will be able to sustain it as much as Oregon has and come out with a Rose Bowl win or national championship appearance in the next couple of years.
And this brings us back to Saturday’s result. It was not the finest performance by Utah’s players. Four interceptions, including one returned for a touchdown, probably had more to do with execution of the game plan than the game plan itself. USC was certainly due for a big game, and the Utes were probably due for a regression to some degree.
Nonetheless, it’s a major test Whittingham didn’t pass. The Utes still probably control their destiny to the top 4, assuming that one other conference winner from the SEC, ACC, Big Ten or Big 12 will have one loss. But the defeat to USC could prove to be as disappointing for Utes fans who watched two undefeated teams left out of the BCS title game as any loss this season for Trojan fans. In some ways, the win might even make Whittingham more interested in coming to USC if as far as he can go is a Rose Bowl.
Ultimately, there are still too many games and too many potential candidates to really speculate about the next head coach. All we can say now is that interim head coach Clay Helton might be leading the field, but that field is still huge.
So I’ll be rooting for UCLA or someone else from the conference to beat Utah one more time to open up a potential conference title for the Trojans. All USC needs is one more Utah loss to control its destiny toward the Rose Bowl.
But if Whittingham goes undefeated the rest of the way, that might be good news too.

Halloween is just around the corner. Whether people are partying it up on the Row or in Berkeley for the weekender, most people are used to throwing together a last-minute costume. For those stumped on what to be, Power Rangers or the Cheetah Girls are so last year. Instead, take a cue from some of the most popular television shows and phenomenons of this year. Or, round up some friends for a collective costume concept.
Member of the Kappa Kappa Tau sorority or Dickie Dollar Scholar fraternity
Ryan Murphy’s new hit television series, Scream Queens, premiered a month ago to rave reviews from television critics. The wardrobe for the members of the fictional Kappa Kappa Tau sorority is, without a doubt, fabulous, unique and funky. For those who want to look like Chanel No. 3, bust out those rhinestones and bedazzle a pair of earmuffs, an accessory that Lourd’s mother, actress Carrie Fisher, inspired with her Star Wars character’s classic hairstyle. For a minimal makeup look, channel Hester (Lea Michele) and wear a ’90s jumpsuit and neck brace. Guys can reveal their Scream Queens guilty pleasure as well. Golf gloves, knit caps and trousers will transform one into a member of the Dickie Dollar Scholars fraternity.
The Four Seasons
Though Los Angeles doesn’t see the changing seasons, most identify with at least one part of the year. Whether it’s winter, spring, summer or fall, there are many ways to create a costume. Round up three of your friends and figure out which season each member in the group wants to be. For winter, try wearing dark blues, purple or black. Don’t be afraid to break out an ugly Christmas sweater a couple of months early. The spring color palette would most likely be pinks and light blues, greens and yellows. For summer, bust out the shorts, swimsuits or swim trunks, or make it all-American to fit the Fourth of July theme. The fall person should try and stick to reds, oranges and yellows, reminiscent of a pumpkin spice latte from Starbucks.
Rock, Paper and Scissors
Take the favorite childhood game to the next level. Buy some cardboard and colored markers to create giant cutouts of these shapes. Another costume perfect for the group setting, this is a great do-it-yourself activity to make with friends a couple of nights before Halloween.
Stages Of – (Insert your favorite celebrity here)
As people age, they go through different style and personality changes — and there is no better representation than those of celebrities. Miley Cyrus started out as cute and fun portraying Hannah Montana on Disney Channel. Fast forward 10 years, and she’s twerking it out on the VMA stage, complete with a foam finger and two tiny, now iconic buns atop her head as part of her outfit. Robert Downey Jr. went from being the ultimate Hollywood bad boy in and out of jail in the ’90s to a very classy man with some stylish glasses. Angelina Jolie broke out in the industry with the image of a dark, strange girl, and now is a proud humanitarian with six kids and a clean-cut image. Again, round up some friends. Each person can pick one celebrity stage — there’s a role for everyone.
Taylor Swift’s “Bad Blood” Squad
“Bad Blood” won a couple of things this year — Video of the Year at the MTV VMAs, millions of views on YouTube and the unofficial social media award for coolest squad of all time. A majority of Taylor Swift’s famous friends appeared in the video, each with an assigned character, role and storyline. Putting this together is easy: The group needs knee-high boots and head-to-toe black outfits. With fake weapons and a picture backdrop of a raging fire, it would be the perfect Instagram photo opportunity.

Over the weekend, I was having a conversation with my mother over text when suddenly she wrote, “got to go,” and stopped texting me back. Not only did I secretly wish she had written “g2g” just for the laughs, but I was also confused about why she couldn’t have just responded to me later when she wasn’t busy. As I sat there laughing about the use of “g2g,” it left me thinking about spending endless hours in middle school chatting on AIM until it was time to sign off. Nowadays, I can never just “sign off” anymore without having a guilty conscience about it. Once, I tried to avoid responding to texts for a full day and I wondered more about whether the other person would think I was mad at them rather than focusing on the reason why I decided to do this in the first place: the fact that I simply needed a break from social interaction.
I told some of my friends that I was taking a “social break,” and they immediately thought I solely meant social media. When I explained  that I meant texting and limiting the ways I interact with people via technology, there was an air of concern that something awful had happened, causing me to need some personal space. This kind of reaction illustrates the problem — that there’s something taboo about being disconnected in today’s society. Not to sound like a member of the baby boomer generation, but I feel that many people are not mentally present in interactions with others because their attention is being divided in multiple directions at all times. One thing that has become most apparent during my time in college is the decrease in emotional connectivity as I meet more people. After countless hangouts in which the other person wasn’t fully present, divided between our conversation and another via text, I decided that being mentally present when spending time with my loved ones is something that must become a priority in my life, and I must create a way to get that same respect back.
I have defined my social break to mean that I am putting more emphasis on face-to-face contact and learning to detach from my technology-based relationships. The goal of this is to figure out what and whom I value in my life. It may appear selfish, but this allows us to establish what personal improvements we have to make. As a senior, I am witnessing social interactions decrease in my life as job and grad school application deadlines get closer. Having an understanding of this, there is an expectation that I should be more sympathetic to those who may not be as available to others as they would like to be, but this has mainly taught me to let go. With only a few weeks left before I complete my degree and move back home, taking a break from interacting with people might seem counterintuitive. This loss of time, however, has brought clarity about building the relationships in my life that are mutual and contribute to my experience at USC and general well-being. The idea is not to cut people off, but rather to alter my energy in more positive and productive directions.
Though the beginning stages of a social break embarrassingly bring feelings of withdrawal, it can also be a point of relief. There is a sense of guilt and a desire to explain to others that I am not upset with them, but that I need to design my time online the way I want in order for this to be healthy for me. For me, this means that the more I explain to others, the more it becomes about them and not about me. The great thing about taking a social break is the option of choice; the length of the break is subjective, as is what is done with the time. Unfortunately, the closest thing we have to signing off these days is the “Do Not Disturb” iPhone feature. But with everything having a mobile application, we aren’t ever truly off the grid. The realization of my obsession with being available at all times has brought a great deal of negativity into my life and an unnecessary expectation for others to do the same. What I hope to accomplish with this time is a chance to be more productive offline as well as enrich my life with meaningful, present relationships.

For most actors, moving to Los Angeles is the ultimate pipe dream. For Kirsten Guenther, however, the move made her realize that she did not want to be a performer. After receiving her B.F.A. in acting from USC in 2003, Guenther discovered a new passion for writing. Most recently, Guenther has penned the musical Breaking Through, centered around an aspiring singer-songwriter trying to succeed in the music industry. The musical is set to have its world premiere on Oct. 27.
“I don’t think I probably would have become a writer if I hadn’t gone to USC actually for acting,” Guenther said during a phone interview with the Daily Trojan.
Guenther said that she got her start in songwriting when someone from the School of Cinematic Arts asked her to write a song for a new musical that she would be acting in. At first she was reluctant, but after discussing further songwriting details, she called her fellow B.F.A. actors to collaboratively compose a piece and ended up writing the entire show. Guenther accredits her alma mater for introducing her to her passion for writing that has now been transformed into a career.
“I don’t know that I would have ever done that as a career if it wasn’t for USC being so generous like that,” Guenther said.
From L.A, the USC alumna moved to Paris where she did freelance journalism as a Paris correspondent for USA Today. Her weekly column, “The Sexy Expat,” featured dating advice, but her relationships were not the biggest story Guenther wanted to tell her audience.
“People would ask me what I did for a living, and I would always say, ‘Oh, I’m a journalist,’ but what I really do is write musicals,” Guenther said.
But the real catalyst behind Guenther’s career in musical theatre came when she was reading a biography. The author talked about going to school for music, which sparked Guenther’s interest. Immediately, Guenther researched options to go back to school for programs in writing musicals. New York University, incidentally, was her only option.
Upon returning from Paris, Guenther headed to New York City to receive her M.F.A. from NYU in musical theatre in 2007. Guenther not only cultivated her writing abilities in New York, but also her abilities to interact with her diverse surroundings.
“I don’t really make things up. I will just edit experiences that I have, so I think that living in New York, Los Angeles and Paris, London — places where you have diversity — is key,” Guenther said. “I like being an outsider, so I like going to new environments.”
Gaining inspiration from her urban encounters, Guenther emerged as a skilled playwright who learned to develop novels into musicals. Her latest project, Breaking Through, is an adaptation of the novel. The script slightly deviates from the original plot with Guenther’s new musical compositions.
As the main character gambles the decisions she has to make concerning her career, the outcome is unknown by the end of the musical, as the story revolves around the importance of the freedom in decision-making.
“It was important for me to find why I was put into [Breaking Through] and to honor the work that was already there,” she said. “[The story] is told in the music business, that’s the setting of it, but I think it’s more about finding freedom and the fact that you always, no matter what, have a choice in life. Once people can discover that, they have permanent power.”
Similar to this aspiring singer-songwriter, Guenther has yet to decide the fate of her career as a playwright.
“I am most excited about writing things that seem impossible, but also inevitable,” Guenther said. “The songs in the show are songs that you could hear on the radio, yet they are functioning theatrically. I found that challenge really exciting and I felt like it would be a very cool idea to write something that could potentially reach a lot of people because people are used to digesting content in that way already.”
Guenther hopes to engage herself in projects where she’s intrigued by the topics yet unaware of how to achieve the finished product until beginning the learning process. Her advice for aspiring writers is to craft something meaningful as opposed to profitable because an audience will come with well-written work.
Breaking Through is playing at the Pasadena Playhouse from Oct. 27 through Nov. 22.

Deena Baum | Daily Trojan
It’s a Friday night. A young man drinks one too many beers with his friends as he prepares for a night out. He deserves to blow off some steam, after all. Dressed in jeans and a button down shirt, with a little gel in his hair, he sees a girl from his biology class standing across the room at the party. He makes his way over to her, and they talk all night.
She wakes up in his bed, with no recollection of how she got there. She sees her clothes spread out around his room. A condom wrapper sits on his bed stand, glaring at her, as she gets dressed. She didn’t say yes. She leaves and thinks, “But he didn’t look like a rapist.”
Last week, college student George Lawlor posted a picture of himself in the online student publication The Tab with the caption “Do I really look like a rapist?” The online world was immediately divided, and an overwhelming number of people decided to join the conversation on the relevance and importance of sexual consent and education. Well, George, any number of young women that have been sexually assaulted on a college campus in the last week, month or year probably did not think their perpetrator looked like a rapist, either. Yet, they cringe every time they walk past them on campus or see them at a party on the weekend.
After being invited to a sexual consent seminar, Lawlor claimed in his blog post that he did not need such training because he doesn’t need to be taught not to be a rapist. He even went as far  as to say that the invitation was a “massive, painful, bitchy slap in the face.” His viral blog post challenged the necessity of such seminars — that are now being required on most college campuses, including USC — and essentially said they were a big waste of time. Truthfully, though, consent classes are the only viable option that can change the culture of rape on college campuses.
A few other men have since followed suit, agreeing that consent classes are offensive and demeaning. Blogger Milo Yiannopoulos, who spoke on campus at a USC College Republicans event just last month, even went as far as to say in a Breitbart article, “this whole campus rape culture myth is really just created to control men, by demonising them and making them fear their own masculinity.”
Well, given that 1 in 5 women are raped while in college, according to The Washington Post, this is not an issue of feminism, but an issue of basic human respect. The reality is that sexual assault and rape are far too common on college campuses, even though most men wouldn’t consider themselves “rapists,” and some are inevitably happening because men don’t understand what rape or full consent means. This is not to say that all men are criminals and rapists. It simply means that everyone, even women, need more education about sexual assault and sexual consent.
This education is especially necessary in a world full of endless gray areas. On any given night across most college campuses, alcohol is a huge factor in the party scene. Intoxication, of course, seriously lowers inhibitions, and according to many state laws, including California’s, when someone is incapacitated from alcohol, a person can no longer give their full consent. Though this idea is extremely controversial, it is something that college students, especially men, need to take into consideration.
Lack of education regarding consent opens up the door for assault, especially in college. Though some men may see these consent classes as common sense or as a waste of time, sitting through a few seminars and lectures is a far better alternative than the lifetime of emotional trauma that a rape or sexual assault can cause a rape victim. Something needs to be done to end this, and the only viable solutions right now are these types of classes.
George Lawlor and other like-minded college males may not think they need this education, but if they honestly think rapists have a certain physical look or that rape culture is a myth, then they are only further proving that they are the ones who need it most.

It’s not uncommon for a college senior to be asked, “What are you doing after graduation?” But the answer isn’t always clear — especially for liberal arts majors. There are so many options: Go to graduate school, get an entry-level job, go to Europe to “find yourself” — the list goes on and on.
Like a lot of my eager classmates, I hope to get a job. Yet even once that decision is made, there are still post-college first-job pressures. I, for one, am panicking just thinking about it.
Fortunately, though, there’s good news: We crazy millennials are disregarding job longevity entirely, instead engaging in the human resources nightmare of job hopping.
According to Forbes magazine, the Bureau of Labor Statistics found that U.S. workers have been with their current employer for an average of 4.6 years, but that among young employees tenure drops to only 2.3 years. More so, a survey by Future Workplace showed that 91 percent of millennials expect to stay in a job for less than three years.
Not getting a dream job out of college isn’t the end of the world, because according to Forbes, millennials will have 15-20 jobs in the course of their lives. Therefore, that first job may not be as important as it seems. The question, “What are you doing after graduation?” suddenly feels far less significant.
Similarly, throughout all my internships, I’m not sure I’ve found exactly what I want to do; however, with each opportunity, I narrow down the search — moving closer and closer to discovering what it is I want as a career. Forbes points to research by Harvard happiness guru Daniel Gilbert that proves humans are terrible at predicting what will make us happy. Therefore, the only way to find out the right move is through trial and error. Even if that first job out of college isn’t a so-called “dream job,” it could be an important stepping stone to figure out real post-graduate goals.
In fact, when NPR asked economists what they would say if they were giving a commencement address, economics professor Justin Wolfers told students to job hop.
“Approach your career ambitions the same way you approached your romantic ambitions at college. Sure, you’re looking for ‘The One,’ but the only way to find that is by going on a lot of dates. And you should think about your first job as a good first date,” Wolfers told NPR. “Try it out. If you like it, stick around for another year. But if not, ask another employer out. And keep playing the field until you’ve found the job you want to stay with.”
More so, Wolfers said that economic research shows that most large pay gains do not come from promotions, but rather from “moving to a job that’s a better fit, with a different employer.” Likewise, Wolfers claimed that romantic success usually does not come from improving a broken relationship, but rather, from moving on and finding a better match.
Similar to how dating is not as clear as it once was, “The One” may not be instantly recognizable.
The significance of job hopping exposes millennials’ uncertainty in the future. Many credit this generation’s use of technology and desire for instant gratification. In fact, in the Forbes article “The Pros and Cons of Job Hopping,” legal consultant David Parnell claimed that while it once was the norm for an employee to stay with an employer for 30 years and then “grab your pension and ride off quietly into the sunset,” Gen X-ers — and eventually Gen Y-ers — are much more driven by instant gratification, which causes them to move more rapidly through jobs.
However, I would disagree that it is the “self-oriented nature” of young workers that causes them to switch jobs; rather, it’s the immense opportunities available. While the question that drives me crazy now is, “What are you doing after graduation?” it’s easy to forget that the question that used to drive me crazy was, “What are you majoring in?”
According to The New York Times, colleges and universities reported nearly 1,500 academic programs just in 2010. There are endless opportunities available in both jobs and fields of study now that never existed in the past — in part, due to technological innovation. While previously there may have only been jobs in public relations, there are now many positions within that field, including social media specialists.
Technological advances have opened the job markets — and university majors — with more fields than ever before, dizzying graduating students with an overdose of opportunities. The pressure is on, like never before, to find a specialized job that both permits success and fulfills happiness.
The good news is, however, that the first post-grad job doesn’t have to provide all the answers to fulfillment. Rather, it’s trial and error. While job hopping may make work more difficult for Human Resources, it allows college graduates to find their true calling — even if it’s 15 jobs later.

USC has a specific type of architecture characterized by its red brick and arched windows. However, there are several places on campus that boast underrated beauty. They can be found in front of, behind and sometimes between the buildings we see day in and day out. If you’re looking for a new place to enjoy some scenery or are simply looking for a new place to take #ootd (outfit of the day) pictures, here are 10 Instagram-worthy places on campus that are worth taking a look at:
 1. Bloom Walk on the south end of Trousdale Parkway
When I lived in Parkside as a freshman, I loved walking back to my dorm this way because it was so still with only the sound of the fountains running and trees rustling. While the fountains are turned off at night now, it is still a nice place with more than enough light for a thought-clearing, nighttime stroll.

2. Seating area facing Literatea
I came here once for a Writing 140 conference with my professor, and I remember sitting here afterwards and working on my paper for a while because it was just so pretty. There is something about the typical coffee shop sounds in Literatea that made me want to stay. Also, being outside to enjoy Southern California weather created a memorable atmosphere. Not to mention, it is pretty hidden, so most times it is not very crowded.

 3. Viterbi School of Engineering Plaza (E-Quad)
Right after the Engineering Quad was revealed, my dance team moved our evening practices over here, and I fell in love mostly with the changing lights of the fountain. It is a very spacious area with a lot of seating where you can work, even as a non-Viterbi student. You can also socialize with friends over a cup of coffee from Tutor Hall Café.

4. Sculpture Garden behind the School of Architecture
This is another area I used to frequent as a freshman. The path behind the School of Architecture provides an additional alternative route to Parkside. The sculptures alone are interesting enough to capture your attention, but they are also placed in a wide, green, grassy area perfect for pictures or picnics.

5. “Crouching Bather” by Antoine Bourdelle behind Roski School of Fine Arts
Adjacent from the Sculpture Garden lies this beautiful fountain. I captured this one for its simple beauty since it stands alone on the backside of Roski. Not shown in this photo is a long stone bench to the right where you can enjoy the outdoors during short breaks or find the calmness in the flow of the fountain.

6. Anna Bing Arnold Plaza between Bing Theatre and Eileen Norris Cinema Theatre
Since I work at the old Annenberg building, this is the area where I spend most of my time. When I walked through the plaza late in the evening one night, I noticed its beauty so much more than I had in the daytime. Anna Bing Arnold Plaza can easily be one of those places where you sit with your friend and have a long talk about life when you just need to get out of your room.

7. Carolyn Craig Franklin Library Garden Courtyard between Doheny Library and McCarthy Quad
Believe it or not, I never took much notice to this particular sight until a friend of mine from out of state visited and stopped me to ask if USC’s campus was “real life.” Since then, I have always stopped to appreciate the fact that we casually have palm trees in between the two of the most popular areas on campus: Doheny Library and Leavey Library.

8. Grace Ford Salvatori Hall
I spent a lot of time here during late-night dance practices so it holds a soft spot in my heart, but I have always found the interior structure of GFS incredibly interesting. I think the below ground set up pictured here makes this stand out from other places on campus to do work, and the open space makes it feel less stressful than a fluorescent-lit room with a bunch of people sitting at big tables. There are also lounge chairs and couches to make everything that much more comfortable.

9. Grassy hill facing the Virginia Ramo Hall of Music
It is arguable that this area is underrated since I see people setting up their hammocks here every day. However, it is one of those spots on campus that everyone recognizes, and no one has any idea what it is actually called. This is the perfect area for relaxing because you won’t find the rush of students that we find in closer to the Campus Center. The best part about this area is that it is always shaded too so it makes power napping a lot easier. Just beware of the squirrels if you are bringing food.

10. View of Von Kleinsmid Center from McCarthy Quad
This was simply one of those “can’t pass this up” pictures. Considering we’ve been in a never ending heat wave, I absolutely had to take a picture of a part of campus that was not only green, but that also featured trees with different colored leaves, as our only proof that fall is a real season.

The City of Angels can best be seen from up above and what’s a better way to spend a Friday night than sharing a meal (or a cocktail) with your friends with the luminescent backdrop of Los Angeles skyline? Here are some of the best spots where you can enjoy a meal with a view.
Located just a short Uber ride away from USC, Perch Los Angeles is a classic, offering views of the city that will take your breath away. In the heart of downtown Los Angeles, Perch’s food is on par with its panoramic views from the 16th floor of. Its diverse menu features many starters, from baked brie with apple and fennel to grain mustard aioli. There’s also a delightful salmon paired with smoked eggplant puree and topped with artichoke chips to add a tasty crunch. To share, I’d recommend the brussels sprouts — tossed with bacon and sherry vinaigrette, this side is both heavenly and healthy. Or if you’re in the mood for something rich and filling, you will love the mac ‘n’ cheese with bacon and black truffle béchamel. Perch is perfect for a romantic date or a night out with friends. Make sure to take the stairs up to the 17th floor for drinks after dinner and even more expansive views — you can even see USC!
