The time of year has rolled around again; hints of pink and red hues are popping up around campus and students are making plans for the big, romantic weekend ahead. But when it comes down to it, we’re still college students who are usually strapped for both time and cash — we all understand the struggle.
You don’t need a lot of time or money or fancy reservations to celebrate this year’s Valentine’s Day though. If you’re looking for a way to enjoy the night with your significant other whether that be with your girlfriend, boyfriend, mom, dad, dog, cat, laptop or fridge, I’ve got a game plan that is sure to play out well for both you and your friend.
One-pot meals are currently all the rave as they offer an easy way to make a delicious meal using a minimal amount of time, money, and dishes.What better food to eat for a Valentine’s dinner than a lightly sauced pasta made with fresh cherry tomatoes and basil? Sounds good, right?
Try out this one-pot pasta that will leave you with your taste buds tingling, your sink with minimal dishes and your date satisfied.
Ingredients:

Directions:

As I stated above, I found my pasta to be cooked thoroughly but still had a good amount of water left over, so I stopped boiling the water and drained about a cup of the starchy water out.

Serve your pasta in either plates or bowls and season additionally if necessary. A sprinkle of grated parmesan on top definitely completes this recipe. Top off your masterpiece with a bit of basil to make it look even nicer for your significant other if you’d prefer. After you and your date have stuffed yourselves full with a heaping plate of gourmet pasta, following up with a sweet, chocolatey dessert is a must.

As for dessert, you can never go wrong with chocolate-covered strawberries. If you’re not the greatest baker, treat your friend to decadent and delightful chocolate-covered strawberries! I think handmade treats are definitely sweeter and more sincere.
For this recipe, all you will need is a pack of fresh strawberries that you can pick up from multiple locations on or near campus: Seeds, Fresh & Easy or maybe you were lucky to snag some from this week’s Farmer’s Market.

Wash and dry your strawberries but leave the stems on — they will come in handy for dipping. It may be a good idea to wait until your strawberries are at room temperature so the chocolate does not get too chunky with moisture from the strawberries while dipping.

The second main ingredient would obviously be chocolate. If I can get my hands on it, I prefer to use chocolate or vanilla almond bark as it is easy to melt and coats smoothly. But after checking both CVS and Fresh & Easy, I had to settle for a bag of milk and dark chocolate chips.
You can use or create a double-boiler system to melt your chocolate, or take the easy route and pour a bag of chocolate chips into a microwave-safe bowl.
Be careful in melting your chocolate-I would recommend microwaving the chips in small increments of 15-20 seconds because chocolate can easily be burned. (Yes, I admit to having screwed up this “easy” step before.)
Have parchment paper set up before you start dipping. (CVS and Fresh & Easy have both been recently out of parchment paper so I had to settle with aluminum foil which also worked fine.)

Dip your strawberries into the melted chocolate coating all sides and leaving a bit of red between the chocolate and the stems for visual appeal.
You can leave your strawberries out to harden with just chocolate on them, or you can be a bit creative and dip your strawberries in additional toppings.

I opted for whatever I found laying in my pantry: walnuts, cheerios that I crushed, and sweetened coconut flakes.
These toppings add both flavor and decoration to your chocolatey masterpieces.
You can leave your strawberries in the fridge to harden, but leaving them in too long might result in too much moisture between the layers which can make the chocolate and strawberry combination not as satisfying.

Both dinner and dessert are great to eat and share with a special someone on Valentine’s Day, but what would be even more fun would be to prepare the meal together!
So whether you’re spending the day with your date, friends, family or if you’re just chilling on your own, these recipes can make your Valentine’s Day just a bit easier and sweeter.
Happy Valentine’s Day, Trojans!

Our campus is not just beautiful; it is useful and conducive for a healthy lifestyle. Though we don’t have hills to run up and down, there is a plethora of ways to workout by staying inside the USC bubble.
For those of you who are runners out there, I have two favorite running trails in the USC area. If you aren’t trying to run into your philosophy professor or that boy from last weekend, the Staples center run is a good option. Measuring 1.7 miles from my home at Troy Hall, this run is one that always leaves me feeling rejuvenated and empowered. Take Fig the entire way. Not only will you get a great taste of life surrounding campus, but you might get winked and or whistled at by a handful of middle-aged men. Granted, I have never really felt unsafe while doing this run, but taking a running buddy with you is always a good idea. Running there and home is a little over three miles and a very great way to start your day off.
Another running trail I love is the classic campus loop. I am not a huge fan of track running, so doing the campus loop is a great way to be able to track your progress in terms of looping from start to stop, but it also is a change of environment. What makes running on the track so frustrating for me is that you continually see the same thing. The campus loop is 2.2 miles with a changing view! Do it one direction, and then change your direction to go the other way if you are looking to try a longer run.
For those of you who are not running gurus, the track has a great grassy area around it that is perfect for personal workouts. Download the NIKE Training Club App for endless exercises that focus on target muscles like abs, legs, butt and arms. FitStar is another great one. Free as well, it acts similarly to a personal trainer coach, adapting its exercise routines to match your physical capability, so the workouts are challenging without being too difficult. MapMyRun is also great for runners to track their runs and also follow other people’s runs.
The track also has stairs on the side of it that you can use to run up and down. Make your sprints range from hard to easy by starting with 30 steps slow, medium and then fast. Don’t just run up and down the stairs, but try hopping or switching from one foot to the other. Running up stairs brings even more benefits because the body is constantly being lifted upward with each step; it engages more leg muscles than running and even improves your vertical jump.
In addition to the stairs, the track has some great new bar equipment to work on pull-ups and increase maximum arm strength…also who doesn’t love playing on monkey bars?! Staying fit is easier than ever!

On Thursday night, the bipartisan political group No Labels held its first policy think tank at the Ronald Tutor Campus Center. Members of the Roosevelt Institute, USC College Republicans, USC College Democrats and Political Student Assembly attended to discuss and formulate solutions regarding broad economic growth and job creation.
Luke Phillips, a junior majoring in international relations and founder of the USC chapter of No Labels began the conversation by addressing students’ views on infrastructure.
“We’re not spending enough on investment in infrastructure,” said Diana Xu, a freshman majoring in business.
Despite the attendees’ differing political views, all agreed that more needs to be spent on infrastructure, which includes anything from broadband connection to disaster preparation. In addition, the attendees agreed that a uniform approach to the corporate tax rate is necessary, so that some corporations aren’t getting taxed at 35 percent and others at 0 percent. They decided that closing the loopholes of the corporate tax rate so that it’s easier to start a business would be a good solution. Though much of the think tank was spent talking about infrastructure and the tax code, No Labels also delved into education.
“I think the more choice, the better when it comes to schooling,” said Alexander Kludjian, the president of USC College Republicans.
No Labels, a national social welfare advocacy organization founded by Republican political adviser Mark McKinnon and Democratic Party fundraiser Nancy Jacobson, encourages bipartisanship in Washington, D.C., by bringing legislators of various parties together at breakfast panels and other types of congressional outings. These outings allow representatives and senators to get to know one another better. In addition, No Labels is crafting a National Strategic Agenda, a policy platform that tackles some of the pressing problems America faces today.
“No Labels is trying to get its National Strategic Agenda looked at by as many big power players in D.C. as possible, so that there will be real chances of the elements of the National Strategic Agenda to be turned into law,” Phillips said.
Phillips first heard about No Labels after attending a conference at Harvard last fall that was centered on bipartisan political solutions. At the conference, Phillips had the opportunity to speak with McKinnon about getting his own No Labels club set up on campus. He created a No Labels chapter at USC after the organization announced that it was launching a campaign to increase university students’ political engagement in advance of the 2016 presidential election.
“I just responded to the call because it looked like a good opportunity to get some good political dialogue here on campus and to bring national politics more closely into USC,” Phillips said.
A self-declared progressive Republican, Phillips enjoys voicing his ideas and participating as much as he can in the bureaucracy.
“I’m too liberal to be a Republic and too conservative to be a Democrat,” Phillips said. “It’s hard for me to talk about policy solutions in either of those parties, so one of the things I like about No Labels is that it is a bipartisan group that opens its door to everybody — from Republicans to Democrats to Libertarians to Socialists and Independents like me.”
Since No Labels was only created this semester, Phillips plans on setting up a table on Trousdale every week with information packets and sign-ups to encourage students to join. He is also planning on having more policy think tanks throughout the semester to provide policy thinkers from various on-campus organizations with an opportunity to discuss and provide solutions to big issues, such as job creation, entitlement reform and a balanced budget. After coming to an agreement on a solution, the participants will write a policy paper together and look for outlets to get it published.
Though Phillips doesn’t mind the fact that No Labels is still a small group, he hopes to expand it with the future policy think tanks he’s planning for the semester.
“We’re not looking to have the masses show up,” Phillips said. “We’re looking for people who are sincerely interested in policy and people who can bring good problem-solving ideas to the table.”

Around two weeks ago, the international students at Waseda University finished their last round of finals and clawed their way out of a fast-collapsing pit of deadlines, study-guides, and quiet panic. The end of the semester meant freedom for all of us, but for some of us — single-semester exchange students — it also meant goodbye. On Saturday, I went to an informal send-off for someone whom I had a budding friendship with — one that had been nipped off too early by the winter of farewell.
We met in an arcade, where he — a shy break-dancer with a slow-spreading smile and a penguin-like waddle to his walk — sat in front of a machine, immersed in a fighting game. For a while, the rest of us formed a ring around him, watching him twiddle the joy-stick and jab at the buttons. His character sent an unfortunate opponent sailing across the screen. I threw a wry smile at another student, standing next to me. The student bent down and whispered, “I bet he’s only playing because he doesn’t want to cry.”
This warmed my smile and thawed my eyes a bit. I blinked, because I don’t want to cry, not here in this arcade filled to bursting with music notes, virtual zombies and stuffed animals. Parting is one of the toughest parts of study-abroad for me, and when the season of watery smiles and lonely hand-waving rolls around, I always find myself wondering why I set myself up for goodbye again and again.
He finished his game, and we headed out to the train station, which was just next door. At first, the rest of us simply surrounded him, joking and laughing. A girl tried to tickle him as the rest of us stood by, attempting to suppress our giggles as we recorded his stoic reaction. We took goofy pictures in which nobody was smiling. Finally, there was no more putting it off—the ticket gates were in view.
“I’ll miss you,” I said, trying to sound flippant.
He paused, and miraculously, he offered me a frank admission of his feelings, “Yeah, me too.”
I thought back to our developing friendship: teasing him in a freezing Waseda lounge about his inability to speak Japanese unless drunk; munching on chicken skewers at an izakaya, otherwise known as a Japanese pub; listening to him sing Ne-Yo at one of the many karaoke joints elbowing each other near campus. There was definitely regret that we didn’t have longer to spend together, but more than that, there was gratitude — gratitude that we were able to meet and laugh together, gratitude that we were able to explore the metropolis of Tokyo together.
He was on the other side of the gates by now. A couple of friends and I stood there and waved, ignoring, for once, the nuisance we were being to the passerby. Unable to resist a final jab at his bashfulness, I stepped forward and called in a silly voice:
“Don’t cry!”
He made a face and turned away, and I felt my smile flicker, like an old lightbulb. But as the memories began to come, propping me up one by one, I could feel my face brightening up again. I turned my back on the ticket gates. I looked at the friends still standing beside me. We laughed awkwardly at each other, and stirred ourselves to walk.
Indeed, I thought, parting is one of the toughest parts of study-abroad — but the memories preceding it: that is what it’s all about.

Though it might be tempting to spend Valentine’s Day — or maybe you prefer to call it Single’s Awareness Day — at a frat party, secretly hating on all the people who are happily in relationships, there are many other (better) activities you can do. Here’s 14 (what a random number!) for you.

Shalaka Gole | Daily Trojan
Looking to impress your sweetheart this Valentine’s Friday with some amazing grub, cooked with love? Look no further, because Cupid Shalaka is here to save your stomach and heart and relationship and everything.
Now that we’ve gotten through the shameless, cheesy hook, let’s get real, my friends. You’re reading this article for one of three reasons: a) You saw my name and thought, dang! She must know how to write a Valentine’s article, b) You’ve already planned Single Awareness Day involving girlfriends/Fifty Shades/ some serious chocolate eating and wine consumption, and want to scoff at how the other side lives, or c) You actually need help cooking a meal for your significant other that goes a step further than getting EVKreative at the made-to-order grilled cheese bar.
Look no further, because Cupid Shalaka can take care of all of you. Though my Valentine’s Day spirit animal is the 72 percent Ghirardelli Dark chocolate that stocks my pantry (bitter), I’ve decided to make peace with the Hallmark holiday in the name of food and all that is good. Because food is all that is good, and no matter the occasion, nothing is more good than food that is shared. (Food = good. Got it? Good.)
I’ve put together a super simple three-course menu-for-two that even you (yes, you in the blue shirt pretending not to read this right now) can wade through with little to no casualties. I’ll get you from doorstep to dessert, and the rest is all your dazzle (or damage control). But I digress.
We’re not doing rocket science, and I promise we won’t bake a soufflé together, rather we are going to take the easiest recipes and spruce them up with fresh ingredients. Here’s what we’re working with: Citrus Salad to start, Tomato Basil Spaghetti Carbonara, and Flourless Chocolate Cake for the raspberry-on-top!
Quaking in your boots? Good — all love starts with a little fear. Let’s jump in!
 
Citrus Salad
This is the easiest, roll-up-your-sleeves-and-watch-me-cook recipe there is. The basics are the fresh spring mix, fresh fruit and a light dressing, all made from scratch. Lemon from the dressing stimulates the appetite, fruit boosts your mood — what’s not to like? Overall, you have plenty of room left for the main attractions to come.

Tomato Basil Spaghetti Carbonara
Disclaimer: I made up that name just now, trying to find a way to combine all the things that I love to eat into one fancy recipe title name and that’s what I ended up with, so it’s not a real carbonara. The main attraction of this course is two-fold: we are going to be making the sauce from scratch (Deep breaths, it is easy and OH so worth it), and we are going to top off the dish with a gooey, perfectly cooked fried egg that oozes wonderful yolky flavor into the dish. If egg isn’t your thing, you can skip it, this dish pack plenty of punch without it.

Flourless Chocolate Cake with Raspberry Compote
Alright, it’s not flourless because it’s low-carb — it’s flourless because flour only gets in the way of the rich, true chocolate flavor that fills these baby cakes. The only special thing to note for these: you’ll need single-serve ramekins (read: glass/earthenware dishes) that are easily found at Target (or even Ralph’s perhaps). This dessert is also customizable to your sweet heart’s desire: top it with ice cream for melty delights, top it again with raspberry sauce because more red means more love, or just eat it plain if you love the deep darkness of chocolate cake. Shout out to Jennifer McHenry’s ‘Bake or Break’ food blog for helping me out with baking proportions and directions. (I’m no chemist, I only study the science of loooooove) ((sorry))

Whether you’re cooking for a loved friend or significant other, I hope your Valentine’s is full of chocolate and no seasonal bitterness.
