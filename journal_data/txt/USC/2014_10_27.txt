Universities around the country are on high alert following the spread of contagious diseases such as meningitis and the Ebola virus.
The Ebola virus has decimated parts of West Africa and is starting to concern more Americans following the recent death of Thomas Duncan, a Liberian man who came to the United States with Ebola and was treated in Dallas, Texas. Two nurses caring for Duncan contracted the disease.

Last week, a San Diego State University freshman died of meningitis Type B, the same strain that was found in outbreaks at Princeton University and UC Santa Barbara last year.
Though there is no threat to the USC campus at this time, school officials say they are prepared should a meningitis case be reported.
“In the event that a USC student, staff or visitor is diagnosed with meningococcal meningitis, Student Health Services and other university departments will collaborate with L.A. County Public Health Department to identify persons who were likely contacts of the ill person, to offer disease education, safety recommendations and prophylactic medication or vaccine as appropriate,” said Dr. James Jacobs, medical director of the Engemann Student Health Center, in an email to the Daily Trojan.
The two most prevalent forms of meningitis include bacterial and viral, both of which are treatable if caught early. Symptoms, however, are similar to the flu and might be ignored by patients for long periods of time. If left untreated, bacterial meningitis can cause death within mere days.
USC collaborates extensively with the L.A. County Public Health Department and Keck Medical Center in various health and wellness promotion efforts to limit the spread of contagious diseases on campus.
Incoming students are required to complete a meningitis questionnaire via email, which highly recommends students, especially those living in dorms, to get the vaccination prior to the start of the semester. The vaccination, however, only protects against four different forms of meningitis, and doesn’t prevent type B, which was the cause of death of the San Diego State University freshman.
Though no known cases of Ebola have been reported in the state of California, the recent influx of reported cases has caused the Centers for Disease Control to post a Level 3 travel notice to all colleges and universities. They are recommending that students and faculty avoid non-essential travel to Liberia, Guinea and Sierra Leone. Universities such as Cornell, New York University and Harvard are also implementing travel restrictions to these countries as well.
At this time, USC has no travel bans in place to any such countries, which concerns senior history major Jennifer Massey.
“USC has more international students than Harvard does,” she said. “In fact, we have more than any other university in the country. I believe USC should take advice from Harvard on this topic.”
Though USC lacks such a travel ban, Bill Regensburger, director of Fire Safety & Emergency Planning, said that the university is well prepared for potential hazardous diseases.
“The university has a well-developed emergency response plan for any hazard, and we are making preparations currently for the possibility that the current Ebola virus reaches L.A. or even USC,” Regensburger said in an email to the Daily Trojan.
Though the Ebola virus is not expected to come to California, hospitals throughout the state say they are taking the necessary precautions with Ebola virus training and informing staff about ways to prevent the spread of the disease should they treat a patient.
“The Engemann Health Center and USC Keck Hospital have both made extensive preparations for the contingency that a traveler from the affected regions of West Africa with or without symptoms turns up at their facilities,” said Dr. Stephanie Hall, chief medical officer for Keck Medicine of USC, which includes oversight of Keck Hospital and the USC Norris Comprehensive Cancer Hospital, in a statement to the Daily Trojan.
She said that patients would then be transported to a hospital designated for potential Ebola patients.
“I believe that their role is to screen for such patients, use Tier I PPE [Personal Protective Equipment] and to isolate them temporarily until they can be transported to a designated Ebola receiving facility prepared to test and treat an Ebola patient.  The CDPH [California Department of Public Health] in collaboration with the California Hospital Association are working to finalize which hospitals throughout the state are designated as Ebola receiving facilities based on current CDC guidelines,” she said in the statement.
Last week, the CDPH announced that the University of California’s five medical centers would be used as priority treatment centers for cases of Ebola in the state.

On Monday, Oct. 27, at approximately 1:20 p.m., a woman and her two children were hit by a car on the corner of Jefferson Boulevard and Vermont Avenue near the University Park campus.

According to LAPD, the woman driving lost control of her vehicle and ran into the bus stop in front of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, hitting a woman and her one-year-old and two-year-old daughters, according to the Los Angeles Police Department.
“LAPD is investigating the vehicle that went over the curb at the [northwest] corner of Vermont and Jefferson that struck a woman and her two children on the bus bench,” said Dept. of Public Safety Deputy Chief David Carlisle. “The victims were transported to the hospital.”
The three victims were the only pedestrians waiting at the bus stop and the only three severely injured. The driver was with her daughter, who was sitting in the passenger seat. Both suffered only minor injuries in the accident.
The car was heavily damaged and left in the middle of Vermont Avenue, with its bumper remaining on the sidewalk. Shattered glass was at the bus stop with the victim’s stroller and children’s clothes left on the ground. The block was closed off by LAPD until the car was removed from the area, and the glass from the bus stop was cleaned up at approximately 4 p.m.
According to LAPD officer Rebecca Gordillo, as of approximately 2:30 p.m. Monday, the victims were in stable condition. Gordillo also stated the reason for the driver losing control is unknown.
“The vehicle was driving eastbound [on] Jefferson and making a left turn northbound on Vermont at the green arrow,” Gordillo said. “We don’t know the exact reason the car lost control, and we will check camera footage from the surrounding buildings. However, what we do know for sure is that the car lost control as the driver was making the left turn and collided into pedestrians at this bus bench.”

Javier Bolden, the man charged with the murders of two USC graduate students, was found guilty on all counts on Monday at the Clara Shortridge Foltz Criminal Justice Center in downtown Los Angeles.
Bolden, 22, was one of two men arrested for the 2012 shootings of Ying Wu and Ming Qu, both 23-year-old engineering students at USC. Bryan Barnes, the other perpetrator, pled guilty to the murders in February and was sentenced to two consecutive sentences of life in prison without possibility of parole.
The guilty verdict came after nearly two days of jury deliberations. Judge Stephen A. Marcus of the Superior Court of Los Angeles County presided over the six-day trial. The jury, which consisted of seven women and five men, found the defendant guilty of two counts of first degree murder, one count of attempted murder and one count of assault with a firearm. The latter convictions referred to a separate incident in the Vermont Square neighborhood of Los Angeles, where Bolden entered a banquet hall and opened fire, seriously injuring two people. The Vermont Square incident took place in February 2012, about two months before the murders of the USC graduate students.
Though Bolden did not himself fire the gun that killed the two students, he is equally liable under the felony murder law since he participated in the robbery alongside Barnes. Furthermore, cell phone recordings exchanged between Bolden and Barnes indicate Bolden’s participation in, and acknowledgement of, the killings. Bolden admitted he shot at the two students to a police informant who was disguised as a cellmate. The informant recorded Bolden discussing how he and Barnes had planned to steal the students’ BMW automobile.
Defense attorney Andrew Goldman claimed Bolden exaggerated his involvement to appear tough to his cellmate. Daniel Akemon, the deputy district attorney in charge of prosecuting Bolden, however, argued that the details of Bolden’s statement to the police and the details he revealed while speaking to the informant showed that he had knowledge of the crime.
Bolden displayed little outward emotion throughout the reading of the verdict as he sat next to Goldman. His mother, who repeatedly declined releasing any comments to media members after the trial concluded, was seated with another family member in the second row.
Marcus adjourned the court by thanking all participants and setting Bolden’s sentencing date to be Nov. 17, with a 15-day grace period to reschedule.

On Monday night, USC hosted noted Puerto Rican actress and singer Rita Moreno at the Visions and Voices event “Rita Moreno: A Celebration of Artistic Achievement.”
The Dornsife College of Letters, Arts and Sciences and the Latino Alumni Association jointly organized the event, and it was co-sponsored by the Program Board Performing Arts Committee. The program took place in Bovard Auditorium and was preceded by a welcome reception.
Lovely Rita · Rita Moreno, an award-winning entertainer, said she knew from an early age that she wanted to be in show business. She told the audience that she was motivated to work harder after facing discrimination. – Audey Shen | Daily Trojan
“We are thrilled to have this amazing leader in the artistic community come here,” said Domenika Lynch, executive director of the Latino Alumni Association. “She worked her way up during a time that wasn’t easy for her demographic, and she has opened so many doors for Latinas in entertainment.”
Moreno has won Emmy, Grammy, Oscar and Tony awards during her lifetime. She is the first person of Hispanic descent to accomplish such a feat, and one of a mere handful of entertainers to ever claim this achievement.
“First and foremost, [Moreno] is among the most respected figures in the performing arts,” English professor David Román said. “Her stature secures USC’s investment, and especially the mission of Visions and Voices, in supporting the arts.”
Román was invited by Dornsife Dean of Diversity and professor of history George Sanchez to moderate the conversation with Moreno.
“Rita Moreno is a pioneer and a living legend,” Román said. “Her presence at USC demonstrates our commitment to excellence and diversity.”
Moreno recounted her daunting move to New York City as a young Puerto Rican girl who spoke no English and was marginalized by her peers.
“I ran home from school every day to avoid the gangs of kids calling me names, and later, I would run from myself,” Moreno said. “I was the niña whose skin was too dark, whose hair was too curly. I realized that people thought something was wrong with me, and what do you do when reality hits? You dream.”
Moreno knew early on she wanted to be in show business, and the industry soon recognized her talent. After landing a seven-year contract with MGM Studios at age 17, though, she was often typecast for her ethnicity.
“The roles I played objectified minority women,” Moreno said. “We were portrayed as ignorant, unable to read and write, and morally bankrupt. We were usually a white man’s mistress. It was degrading, but in those times, it was to pay the rent.”
By the 1960s, Moreno became a civil rights activist as well. She spoke for political causes and participated in the March on Washington, even coming within 15 feet of Martin Luther King Jr.
“I began to see myself as a bigger part of the picture than just entertainment,” Moreno said. “I was becoming a public figure as well, so it wasn’t just about me and my own troubles anymore.”
One of Moreno’s most iconic and life changing roles was Anita in the Robert Wise and Jerome Robbins’ film adaptation of the Broadway musical West Side Story.
“Becoming Anita would alter my trajectory and change my life and my career forever,” Moreno said. “I discovered I could actually be a person of strength, and it became a personal mission for me outside of that role.”
Those in attendance included faculty, alumni and students.
“I was interested in attending the event because I am involved in theater and Rita Moreno not only had an amazing performance in West Side Story, but is one of the most successful people in entertainment,” said Ezie Nguyen, a freshman majoring in human biology.
Now 82, Moreno remains active in entertainment. Since 2000, she has released a jazz album under the American record label Varèse Sarabande in addition to playing recurring roles in TV shows such as the drama Law and Order: Criminal Intent and the sitcom Happily Divorced.
“She is such an inspiration,” Lynch said. “It’s great that someone her age is still doing what she loves and is willing to share her passion with the Trojan family.”
Moreno’s career has now spanned more than six decades, and she insisted to the audience she is not finished yet.
“Every day is a new adventure,” Moreno said. “I think of all the things I have to accomplish, and I do them. I often remind myself of the phrase, ‘No spirit is ever diminished by a passion for life.’”

For the past month, British singer Charli XCX has been touring the United States accompanied by fellow female musicians Elliphant and Femme. They’ve sold out their shows across the nation and brought together masses of fans who often stake out positions in line starting in the morning. Both Ellinor Olovsdotter of Elliphant and Laura Bettinson of Femme earned their places on this tour through their demonstrated commitment to their art and their phenomenal presence.
Elliphant in the room · Ellinor Olovsdotter, who performs under the name Elliphant, only began performing a couple of years ago. Before deciding to work in music, she worked in fashion and photography. Her work caught the attention of Diplo, who she describes as a pivotal mentor in her life. She is now touring with Charli XCX alongside singer Femme. – Photo courtesy of TEN Music Group
Elliphant began only a couple years ago as a new musical project of Olovsdotter’s. Having already been involved in fashion and photography, she spontaneously decided to begin making music and incorporated her experience traveling the globe into a unique, genre-bending sound, with elements of R&B, pop and world music. Her work quickly caught the attention of Diplo, who she describes as a pivotal mentor in her life and her equivalent to an A&R representative. Since then, Olovsdotter has become close friends and collaborators with Skrillex and has booked time with Dr. Luke, among other top producers. While she enjoys the opportunities to work with such talent, Olovsdotter said her hectic touring and recording schedule has left her unable to spend as much time in the studio with her music as she would like, noting that it takes time for her to process what she’s written and to fully appreciate how it sounds.“I’m never excited about my songs; they always come to me a month later,” Olovsdotter said. “Hearing them later I’m like, ‘Yeah, I need perspective.’”
Even though her songs have generated millions of hits and she has a history of working with artists who would inspire envy in anyone, Olovsdotter remains refreshingly humble and grounded. There are numerous musicians she said she would be enthralled to work with, including the members of Portishead, a band she described as the only act in recent memory over which she has truly been fan-crazed. For the moment, however she wants to hone her craft and work together with the touring crew she assembled in Sweden.
“I’ve been so cocky and, in a way, insecure, that I’ve tried to be in crazy control over everything and it made me very lonely in my art,” she said. “I always felt that my art didn’t have a crew. Now I have so many people on this project with me and I feel stupid because I wasn’t looking at what they were doing and they know what they’re doing.”
Playing alongside Elliphant on the tour is Femme, the one-woman powerhouse outfit of Laura Bettinson. Bettinson not only writes, produces, records and performs her own music, but she is also in charge of her art direction, merchandise and music videos. Bettinson began working with synthesizers and electronic production while a student at Goldsmiths, University of London. It became impractical for her to transport a piano around the city to perform and so she began looking into more portable solutions. That led to the creation of her spirited pop and caught the attention of famed Radiohead producer Nigel Godrich, who soon enlisted Bettinson as the lead singer of Ultraísta. A successful worldwide tour followed the release of their first record, and after the band’s two other members went to work on Atoms for Peace, she turned her focus to Femme and released her second single, “Fever Boy,” last fall.
With an EP already out and an album slated for early next year, there is plenty of new material on the way from Bettinson. Speaking about the sound of the record, she said, “There are still all those summer sass, laid-back jams. It’s quite pink, I guess, in some ways, but there are also darker moments on it, too. But basically what I tried to do is give you a sense of personality, because I’m making it all and producing it all and I think that there’s an inherent sense of my personality that comes through on it anyways. Which I guess if people like my personality, then people will like the record.”
When asked about her involvement in all aspects of her image and career, she seems confident and content.
“It wasn’t my agenda to set out and do it all myself, it’s just what I enjoy doing,” Bettinson said. “It didn’t occur to me that I would get anyone else to do it. It was just like, I feel like taking a photo, or I fancy making a video. So it’s been a very organic process in that sense, it’s just what I do. I wake up sometimes and make music and sometimes I like to take photos and I enjoy doing all of it. If suddenly I fall out of love with one thing, of course I’ll get someone else to try and help me do it, but it’s just a really natural process.”
With a bulk of new music soon to come from both of these entrepreneurial women, it won’t be long before they are headlining tours of their own. And they’ll have nothing to thank for it but their own hard work.

There are few activities that excite me more than going to the farmers market. What began as an occasional outing in high school has grown into a beloved weekend ritual that I look to for inspiration and community. As I have become more conscientious of where my food comes from and what goes into it, I have developed greater admiration for local farmers and the work they do.
Farm fresh · Farm-to-table food isn’t simply the latest passing trend, the food tastes better and reach their nutritional peak soon after harvest. – Maral Tavitian | Daily Trojan
Though some might regard the concept of farm-to-table food as a fad, eating honestly grown, local and seasonal produce offers many benefits. Not only does it taste better, but most fruits and vegetables reach their nutritional peak around the same time they ought to be harvested. In contrast, grocery store produce often travels thousands of miles before hitting the shelves, meaning that it was picked well before it was ready to be consumed. These factors are especially important for college students looking to embrace a more balanced, healthy diet.
Though farmers markets are at their prime during the summer, the stalls filled with piles of vibrant stone fruits and plump heirloom tomatoes, fall brings its own bounty of beautiful produce. In this guide, I have shared my tips for how to best navigate the farmers market as a college student. Shopping for one requires a different approach than buying for an entire family. Learning how to strategically select items will allow students to maximize their time and money spent, both at the market and in the kitchen.
Sample with discretion. 
Everyone loves free food, especially budget-strapped college students. While there is no better way to determine a product’s quality than to sample it, it is important to avoid a state of palate overload. If you try too many items, all the flavors will meld together, and you will forget which fruits reigned supreme. So despite your urge to stick a toothpick into every sample, only taste items that you intend to purchase.
Choose produce wisely.
The farmers market is a one-stop shop for your weekly supply of fresh produce. Since college students mostly cook for themselves, it is important to select items that will stay fresh throughout the week and easily transform into meals. Fall offers a wonderful variety of sturdy fruits and vegetables such as apples, carrots, squash and zucchini. Unless you plan on consuming it immediately, steer clear of produce with a short life span, such as berries and tomatoes. If vegetables have begun wilting and are unappealing raw, roasting then storing them in the refrigerator is a simple solution that I rely on often.
Get to know your vendors. 
The farmers market offers a unique opportunity to build relationships with the people who grow your food. Do not be shy about asking questions; not only will you learn valuable information about harvesting practices and production, but you show your appreciation for the farmers work. Many farmers will offer discounts to loyal customers or throw in special products for you to try for free. Unlike the sterile environment of major grocery stores, these personal interactions create a more intimate, community-oriented experience.
Look for healthy snacks. 
Studying for exams would not be the same without snacks. Though fresh fruits and vegetables are ideal for munching, the farmers market also offers great prepared foods. Hummus, mixed nuts and dried fruits are healthy options that will energize you to get through a late-night study session. Stocking up on Mediterranean-style olives, feta cheese and whole wheat pita bread also makes for a quick and easy dinner when you are pressed for time.
Spinach Salad with Apples and Cranberries 
This simple salad allows you to transition into the season without turning on the oven and is an ideal way to incorporate apples into a savory meal. You can use any variety of apples, but I prefer Pink Lady or Fuji for a bit of sweetness.
• 3 cups baby spinach
• 3/4 cup diced apple, from about 1 small apple
• 1/2 cup dried cranberries
• 1/4 cup crumbled goat cheese
• 1/4 cup candied pecans, coarsely chopped
• Salt and pepper
 
For the balsamic vinaigrette:
• 1 teaspoon lemon juice, from half of a small lemon
• 1 teaspoon Dijon mustard
• 1 tablespoon balsamic vinegar
• 1 tablespoon olive oil
• Salt and pepper
 
Total: 15 min. Serves two.
1. In a large serving bowl, lightly toss together spinach, diced apples, cranberries, goat cheese, pecans and a good pinch of salt and pepper. In a small bowl, mix together the lemon juice, mustard and vinegar. Slowly drizzle in the olive oil, whisking constantly. Season with a pinch of salt and pepper. Pour over salad and toss to make sure everything is coated. Serve.

As of Sept. 26, USC’s newest sports bar and grill, Study Hall, opened its doors to the Trojan community. Conveniently located on the corner of Hoover and 29th street, this restaurant is a dynamic new dining option for students.
Versatile · The restaurant is able to serve as a coffee shop, sports bar, brunch locale and late night munchie destination. This versatility is a boon for a restaurant located next to a college campus as it can satisfy many needs. – Ralf Cheung | Daily Trojan
Study Hall was conceived when the sports bar, The 29th Street Cafe, came under new ownership. It inhabits the old location, but many changes are evident, making this the newest USC hotspot.
The outside has been remodeled to emulate a quaint cottage giving the feeling of a “homestyle” dining experience. Ample seating is provided outside on a partially covered patio. The inside also offers a well-situated assortment of tables in addition to as a small bar tucked aside. The size is perfect for a large group lunch and game viewing or a quiet weekday meal.
Perhaps the most impressive aspect of Study Hall is its ability to alternate between sports bar, coffee shop, brunch destination and late night munchies spot. The restaurant is conveniently open on weekdays from 8 a.m. to midnight and on weekends from 11 a.m. to midnight. Within Study Hall, there are multiple televisions perfect for game viewing as well as quiet alcoves for studying.
Study Hall has an open, friendly atmosphere and an attentive staff. They are receptive to customers, making them feel like regulars. It is this quality that will have students and others coming back again and again.
As for the menu, Study Hall hosts breakfast, lunch and dinner. Among the options there is something for everyone to enjoy. Their breakfast menu is filled with creative options, rivaling those of Jacks N Joe. The French toast features brioche, cinnamon-roasted apples and smoked almonds, topped with Mexican hot chocolate whipped cream.
Other breakfast favorites are the breakfast sandwiches and burritos. Those looking for a health conscious first meal of the day will find satisfaction with the “Waist Watcher.” The wide array of options will certainly fill tables, especially on the weekends.
Living up to the sports bar reputation which precedes it, there is a selection of pub grub available for hungry tailgaters. Among the crowd favorites are the chili cheese fries doused in spiced pork chili and smoked mozzarella. Wings are offered in a variety of styles such as classic buffalo, crispy, BBQ and maple-glazed.
Those looking for hearty lunch and dinner can certainly count on Study Hall to suit their needs. A wide selection of sandwiches, burgers and sliders are offered to hungry customers. The “Why Not” burger has been featured on their Facebook page and Yelp. The Angus patty, pile of pastrami, sunny side up egg, provolone, crispy shallots, onion marmalade and mustard aoli satisfy the spectrum of taste buds. All burgers are also served with a side of Study Hall-made herbed Kennebec fries.
It is to be said that Study Hall brings in more points for concept than for actual execution on a lot dishes. Many of the plates are lacking in certain areas, an issue noted by another diner who felt that the mac and cheese could’ve used some more cheese, and the sliders were underwhelming without sauce. The diner was quick to add, however, that the food was a great start to a promising business.
The Study Hall prices are comparatively fair to the surrounding competition. Starters range from $2 to $10 and no entree exceeds $14. It is the perfect spot for a cost effective fix at anytime of the day.

The USC women’s volleyball team (12-8, 5-5 Pac-12) made the trek up to Northern California last week to take on Pac-12 rivals Cal (8-12, 0-10) and Stanford (20-0, 10-0 Pac-12). The Women of Troy split the road trip, pulling out a win against the unranked Bears, but falling to the No. 1 Cardinal.
Stepping up · Sophomore outside hitter Elise Ruddins had an impressive performance against Stanford, tallying nine kills and two service aces. The Laguna Niguel, California, native has 45 kills so far this season. – Brian Ji | Daily Trojan
On Oct. 22, visiting USC cruised to a 3-1 victory over Cal at the Haas Pavilion in Berkeley. After winning the first set, the Women of Troy gave up the second set to the Bears. USC then won two straight sets to clinch the victory.
The Women of Troy and the Bears were practically neck-and-neck in the first set, with three lead changes and five ties. In fact, neither team led by more than three points until USC took a 22-18 advantage on a kill by junior outside hitter Samantha Bricio. The team would lead by as many as five points before claiming a 25-21 win in the first set. The Women of Troy tallied 16 kills, 21 digs and three team blocks compared to Cal’s 14 kills, 16 digs and two team block.
The Bears turned things around in the second set, however, winning 25-17. Despite having the same number of digs and more team blocks than the Bears, USC failed to stop Cal defensively and never had a lead. The Bears’ offensive dominance in the second set could be seen in their kill numbers: Cal had 17 kills, nearly double that of the Women of Troy.
USC did not let poor play in the second set deter them and got back to their winning ways. Offensively, the third set was more evenly matched than the 25-19 score might indicate, as both teams had 13 kills and 13 assists. The difference was the Women of Troy’s defense and serving. USC had three more team blocks than the Bears in the third set. Additionally, the visitors had three service aces compared to none for the Bears.
The Women of Troy used their momentum from the third set to carry them to a 25-21 victory in the fourth and final set. USC opened up the set with a 9-3 lead, but the Bears came roaring back, eventually taking a 17-16 lead. A few plays later, however, the Women of Troy retook the lead permanently on an attack error by Cal middle blocker Lillian Schonewise. Soon after, the Women of Troy finished the match victorious on a service ace by Bricio.
Four days later, the Women of Troy sought an upset victory over undefeated Stanford. It was not to be, however, as USC fell in four sets, ending a three-match winning streak against the Cardinal.
The Women of Troy had a positive start to the match, taking the first set by a slim 25-23 margin. The set was close throughout, with 11 ties and nine lead changes. USC had fewer kills and assists in the first set than Stanford, but the Women of Troy held slight edges in the digs and hitting percentage categories.
Despite the great start, USC was unable to beat Stanford the rest of the match, losing three straight sets. The Women of Troy didn’t lose by more than six points in any of the three sets, but the Cardinal closed out the tightly contested sets with the mental strength of a No.1-ranked squad.
Bricio led all players with 19 kills, also picking up 16 digs in the match. Nwanebu had 15 kills and also recorded 16 digs. Sophomore outside hitter Elise Ruddins performed well, tallying nine kills and adding two service aces.
USC’s next match will be at home on Wednesday, Oct. 29 against No. 2 Washington (21-0, 10-0). Washington beat the Women of Troy a few weeks ago in Seattle.
Though USC is still trying to find a way to beat a ranked team, head coach Mick Haley says his team is performing well in his book.
“The team is flying right now,” Haley said.

In search of an emotional lift after a tough stretch of hard-fought losses, the USC women’s soccer team scored golden goals in consecutive overtime games this weekend, and return from a road trip to the state of Oregon with two conference victories.
Roasted Duck · Freshman midfielder Sydney Sladek provided the deciding goal in a crucial double-overtime win over Oregon on Friday. – Brian Ji | Daily Trojan
 
Freshman midfielder Sydney Sladek slotted home the winner in a 1-0 victory over Oregon (6-8-2, 2-5-1) on Friday, while senior midfielder Alex Quincey did the same in a 2-1 win against Oregon State (0-14-3, 0-7-0) on Sunday.
Heading into the weekend, the Women of Troy (10-5-2, 4-4-0 Pac-12) had dropped four of their previous five matchups, all in Pac-12 play. The stretch was especially frustrating because all five games were played at home, and despite amassing 56 combined shots in the four losses, the Women of Troy only found the back of the net once.
“We needed to get hungrier, particularly offensively,” head coach Keidane McAlpine said. “Every team in this conference is talented and scouts well, and so we need to do a better job being aggressive and ready to go.”
The team rose to the occasion in their Friday matchup against a tough Duck squad. After an intense back-and-forth scoreless regulation period, the two teams went into overtime to determine the outcome of the match. Neither team was able to break through in the first OT period, setting up Sladek for some late-game heroics. In the 104th minute, Sladek struck a beautiful shot from 25 yards out that floated over the head of Ducks goalkeeper Abby Steele into the nylon netting of the goal for the walk-off winner.
The golden goal helped the team build some much-needed momentum heading into their second match of the weekend, against the hapless Beavers.
“[Oregon] was a fantastic and much-needed win for us,” McAlpine said after the match. “I am very happy with the contribution that every player made tonight.”
The Women of Troy were able to do just that in Sunday’s matchup with Oregon State, though it was by no means a clean victory. The Beavers put up a surprisingly solid defense, partially due to a little home-field help: Rain fell throughout the game, creating a very wet and muddy surface out of a field that was already fairly torn up from the OSU men’s soccer team.
“The field conditions Sunday were pretty poor,” junior defender Whitney Pitalo said. “It was raining the whole time. Our jerseys and socks were covered in mud by the end of the game.”
Much like the weather, the game got off to a bit of a dreary start, as Oregon State broke a 0-0 tie early in the second half with a ricochet goal in the box in the 49th minute from OSU defender Miranda Stiver. The goal was just the third of the season for the winless Beavers.
Instead of burying their heads in the mud, however, the Women of Troy responded just four minutes later with an equalizing corner kick header from Pitalo, assisted by junior midfielder Jamie Fink. It was Pitalo’s first goal of the season, and it came at a crucial time for USC.
“[Freshman midfielder] Nicole Molen and I are two of the players who are supposed to be in the box looking for headers on corner kicks,” Pitalo said. “We had been struggling a little bit to put away chances this season, so on Sunday, when the chance came to me, I said to myself, ‘This needs to happen.’”
Not only was the score a crucial response for the team, but it meant a little something extra for Pitalo, who was named the Pac-12 Defensive Player of the Week for her efforts.
“I’m from Oregon,” she said. “For me, it was really exciting to play there and do well in front of my loved ones.”
Pitalo’s goal was the last of regulation, and once again, the Women of Troy found themselves facing an overtime situation. With the confidence they gained after Friday’s double-overtime victory, however, they were prepared for the do-or-die atmosphere. In the 96th minute, Quincey buried her team-best 10th goal of the season into the back of the net, securing the victory for USC and sending the Beavers home. The victory brought the team’s Pac-12 Conference record back to even, at 4-4.
The Women of Troy now will have the week to prepare for a two-game road trip to Washington this upcoming weekend, where they will face No. 18 Washington on Friday followed by No. 24 Washington State on Sunday. Both games will be huge contests for USC, who will need to perform well in order to keep their playoff aspirations alive. The game Sunday at Washington State will be especially meaningful, as it is a homecoming game for McAlpine and his staff, who left the Cougars’ program at the end of last season to take the job at USC.
Though the team still faces a tough path in the weeks ahead, the two road victories should help the Women of Troy to restore a sense of confidence that has been missing in the last few weeks.
“Keidane {McAlpine] told us going into this past weekend that when aggression meets aggression, talent will prevail,” Pitalo said. “We are a great team and know we have the talent, so now it comes down to our mentality and being able to match the opposition’s aggression.”

This week’s column was supposed to be about the USC rugby team, but the Trojans found a way to snatch defeat from the jaws of victory for the second time in four weeks on Saturday. My colleague and fellow Daily Trojan sports columnist Jake Davidson outlined the reasons for the loss, calling the Trojans “just an average seven or eight-win football team.” Statistically, he’s probably right.
The Trojans have five wins right now and four games left. But it’s time to abandon that College Football Playoff pipe dream and focus on what’s important for USC: beating UCLA and Notre Dame. There’s a trend of entitlement and fading arrogance that surrounds this USC football program and fan base, and it’s completely unwarranted.  The last time USC won a national title was ten years ago. Provided, that’s a short time compared to ASU (they’ve never claimed a national title) or UCLA (60 years — no one’s holding their breath, Bruins).
But it’s not the absence of National Championships and Rose Bowls that’s going to get a coach fired (or an interim coach replaced). Coaches don’t get fired after losing on a last-second Hail Mary or failing to shore up defensive inefficacies in the fourth quarter. Phone calls are made when the Trojans go out to repossess that Victory Bell after a one-season loan and come up short. Say what you like about USC head coach Steve Sarkisian’s inability to maintain a high level of morale on the sidelines, or his patently awful play calling down the stretch. Complain all you want about defensive coordinator Justin Wilcox’s tenuous bend-but-don’t break approach (I did).
The only thing we can’t complain about this season is USC’s players. They’ve been putting in an insane amount of effort on every play, playing at high intensity for three-and-a-half quarters and taking whatever the coaches are giving them. Consider that there’s very little depth on this team before the USC starters suffer a massive drop-off in production (especially on defense), and a healthy USC team looks very much in the title hunt next season.
In spite of their efforts, let’s be honest with ourselves: This is not a College Football Playoff-caliber team. USC might boast the most talented starters in the Pac-12, but the lack of depth pigeonholes Sarkisian’s game plan to the “risk-averse” approach Davidson described in Monday’s column. Which is why I’m proposing that USC needs to focus on the opponent in front of them, and not think about a bowl game, the Playoff, the Pac-12 Title Game or any other “possible scenario.”
The Trojans have been beating up on some historically overrated teams in Arizona (which, for some reason, remains ranked No. 14 in the nation despite a loss to the Trojans at home) and Stanford. Now they have two games against an (admittedly still pretty overrated) UCLA squad and a potentially properly rated Notre Dame team.
These two games will be the real test of whether or not this season was a failure. This season is salvageable because frankly anyone who said they had expectations for this team prior to the season is lying. It’s been a roller coaster ride of a season, but heartbreaking losses in the last seconds shouldn’t shake the Trojan spirit or foist the Trojans’ season into forgettable oblivion. I’d like to think that a school with the motto “Fight On” would have a more resilient fan base than that. When considering first year coaches for USC, we have to account for the installation of a new system and the establishment of expectations. Calling Sarkisian “seven-win Sark” in his first season as a head coach of an entirely new group of players is just stupid. Pete Carroll was 6-6 in his first season at the helm of USC. We gave Lane Kiffin an 8-5 season, and it’s only reasonable that Sarkisian be given a similar leeway to install his system before we start having expectations. So the way I see it, this season isn’t lost until USC loses to UCLA — and I’m confident that’s not going to happen.

As a result of their heartbreaking road loss to then-No. 19 Utah on Saturday night, the USC football team dropped out of the AP Top 25 Poll and is unranked for the second time this season.
More bad news · Senior linebacker J.R. Tavai will miss several weeks after injuring his knee against Utah on Saturday. The Redondo Beach, California, native is second on the team with 7.5 tackles for loss so far this season. – Mariya Dondonyan | Daily Trojan
 
It was the first time that Utah had ever defeated USC (5-3, 4-2 Pac-12) in Pac-12 play, and they did so in a nail-biting fashion that recalled memories of the last-second Hail Mary that Arizona State used to beat USC three weeks ago.
“We are going to continue to grow and learn,” USC head coach Steve Sarkisian said about the loss. “We are going to be better for it.”
USC suited up a season-low 48 scholarship players against Utah, with only 41 of them playing on the field. Following the game, Sarkisian did not blame the team’s lack of depth for letting up in the fourth quarter.
“I won’t ever lean on that,” Sarkisian said, in reference to the team’s limited availability of scholarship players.
The Trojans’ fourth quarter performance paralleled that of past games this season, including when they struggled to put away both Arizona schools.
After being stopped on a questionable fourth down decision to go for it at Utah’s 28-yard line with 2:08 to play, the USC defense allowed Utes quarterback Travis Wilson to lead a game-winning drive, capped off with a one-yard touchdown to wideout Kaelin Clay with just eight seconds left to play.
Though the loss is a blow to the Trojans’ Pac-12 title hopes, Sarkisian mentioned that there were still a lot of positives to take away from the game, including success in pass protection and freshman cornerback/wide receiver Adoree’ Jackson’s 100-yard kick return for a touchdown. On Monday, Jackson was named the Pac-12 special teams player of the week.
In his Sunday teleconference, Sarkisian said that his team needs to develop a killer instinct, especially if it wants to get back into contention in the Pac-12 South.
“I don’t feel this conference race is over,” Sarkisian said.
Unfortunately for the Trojans, injuries to key players do not help that cause.
Redshirt sophomore left tackle Chad Wheeler will miss the rest of the season due to a torn ACL in his right knee after being injured during the third play of Saturday night’s game. Senior Aundrey Walker will take over at left tackle for Wheeler after finishing out the rest of the game against Utah.
Senior linebacker J.R. Tavai will also be out several weeks with a knee injury. Tavai ranks fifth among the team in tackles with 41 and is third on the team in sacks.
Finally, redshirt junior tailback Javorius “Buck” Allen banged up his shoulder against Utah but is expected to play on Saturday.
The Trojans cannot afford to lose the Pac-12’s leading rusher in Allen, whose career season includes 1,010 yards rushing through just eight games.
USC will try and rebound next Saturday on the road in Pullman, Washington where they will get to take on quarterback Connor Halliday and the Washington State Cougars. The Cougars (2-6, 1-4) are coming off a 59-37 home defeat at the hands of the Arizona Wildcats. The Saturday tilt will kick off at 1:30 p.m.

Today marks one month since the pro-democracy protests erupted on the crowded streets of Hong Kong. Though Sunday’s cancellation of a referendum for protesters underscores the caution put into each step going forward, it also draws attention to cracks of division  forming within the pro-democracy forces.
Lili Scarlet Sedano | Daily Trojan
Without a clear leader, the movement has a spontaneous, grassroots nature that has served as its strength so far, with crowds of young people organizing themselves. That amorphous aspect, however, could also become its biggest weakness as chaos escalates. Instead of continuing to hold out in the streets, protesters should retreat before the movement loses credibility amid the din of violence.
Make no mistake: Retreat would not detract from the fact that the movement has been one of remarkable power and value. Lauded as one of the most peaceful protests in the world, the insurgence reflects that student protesters understand the need to heed the expectations of good citizenship to succeed.
Yet, as police brutality intensifies in these later days, the movement could lose credibility and unity by continuing. The heavy smog of mistrust has pervaded the city, and displays of violence make what started out as a peaceful protest seem radical and out of control. Videos online have surfaced, showing police dragging protesters into alleyways and proceeding to beat them. On Oct. 18 in the neighborhood of Mong Kok, according to The Guardian, 20 people were injured in clashes with police, who were wielding heavy batons, metal guardrails and pepper spray. In the densely packed district far poorer than the commercial streets of Admiralty and Causeway Bay, police brutality and the presence of anti-Occupy Central protesters, coupled with the differing aims of pro-democracy groups, exacerbated the chaos.
The divisions cut into the family room as well. Differing views on the protests have strained relations in many households. The Sydney Morning Herald interviewed a citizen identified as Mr. Mak, and his 18-year-old son Dasher, who has been attending rallies. Worrying for his son’s safety, Mr. Mak said, “I don’t have any opinion; the chief executive has nothing to do with me. I just think about making enough money, paying for our food and bills, and just try to live comfortably.” Many adults don’t see a point in upsetting a status quo that provides relative stability. As of 2014, 76.4 percent of the population are aged 25 and above, according to CIA World Factbook. Without the older generation on board, it’s difficult for the movement to really say it speaks for all of Hong Kong’s citizens.
Granted, the government’s unyielding stance — even in the face of such passionate cries for change — is unacceptable. But to carry on even as tensions rise could be an even larger risk for the movement as a whole.
Add to that the divisions and disorganization demonstrated by the vote cancellation, and retreating seems like the best option right now. By no means does that translate to a surrender though.
Thirty-three years remain before Hong Kong will revert to full Chinese governance. It is the youth, not the older generation, who will inherit this new political reality. Democracy won’t happen overnight, and students can’t stay out on the streets forever, but the hope to fight for their freedom and ideals is very much alive.
Regardless of the endgame, Beijing cannot continue to ignore the pro-democracy protests that have politically reawakened Hong Kong to the ongoing struggle of democracy so integral to the future of its people.

For the past month, thousands of demonstrators have gathered in the streets of Hong Kong in protest of China’s decision to have an appointed committee screen candidates for the semiautonomous city’s elections in lieu of transparent universal suffrage. The leaders of the movement — dubbed the Umbrella Revolution by some — announced Sunday that they would cancel plans to conduct a poll surveying their supporters on the counterproposal to offers made by Hong Kong’s government in response to the protests, citing a lack of unity in the movement’s stance and actions.

The decision to call off the referendum was a responsible move on the part of the protests’ organizers as a means of regrouping and reaffirming the long-term goals and strategy of the diverse movement. The movement needs to rethink their strategy, but nevertheless, keep pressing on.
“We believe a mass movement should act according to the will of the people and we apologize to the public for the lack of discussion among the participants before making the previous decision,” the protest leaders said in a statement.
Though the movement’s call for open elections is still fundamentally important, the decision on the part of its leaders to regroup and reorganize their strategy is integral to its future success. That cannot be done, however, unless the protesters understand the diversity of opinions within their own ranks.
The two-day vote, which was to be issued via electronic ballot on Sunday and Monday, intended to ask participants to cast their votes on two motions regarding Hong Kong’s election procedures. The first question asked whether voters agreed that China’s central government should withdraw its Aug. 31 decision to limit Hong Kong’s 2017 chief executive election to a few pre-screened electoral candidates chosen by Beijing — the decision that ultimately sparked the Hong Kong protests in the first place. The second question asked whether the government should allow for the public nomination of candidates for the 2017 elections, instead of allowing the decision to be made by functional constituencies, or special interest groups in charge of electing 30 out of Hong Kong’s 70 legislators.
The decision to postpone the vote ultimately came as a result of the protest leaders’ realization that they did not have enough information to truly represent the views of all the protesters. This lack of unity is in large part due to the sheer diversity of the demonstrators within the Hong Kong protests. Many of the activists belong to one or more of the organized groups within the protests, and some don’t affiliate with any at all. Among the associations and groups represented in the movement are the Hong Kong Federation of Students, Scholarism and Occupy Central With Love and Peace.
A movement is nothing without direction and organization. But rather than retreat without a resolution, Hong Kong protesters should use this critical time in their movement’s history to reevaluate their goals and seek out meaningful ways of reaching them.
As the protests run into their second month of mobilizing, with no clear resolution in sight, it’s crucial that the movement’s leaders definitively define their collective goals and direction. Protesters cannot occupy the streets forever — at some point a decision must be made. But when that decision happens, it must be one that accurately represents the views and beliefs of those demonstrating, collectively.
