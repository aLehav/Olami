Former Trojan 24kGoldn just secured the top spot on the Billboard Hot 100 Chart with his single “Mood” on Monday. Entering its 10th week on the chart, the song marks the artist’s first No. 1 single.
Born Golden Landis Von Jones, the 19-year-old came to USC in Fall 2018 on a full-ride scholarship to major in business administration at the Marshall School of Business. But he didn’t stay long. 
The success of such viral hits “I Go to USC” and “Valentino” quickly attracted the attention of major labels, prompting the artist to take a leave of absence after signing a deal with Columbia Records.
Like many of today’s rising stars, 24kGoldn’s success has largely been thanks to TikTok. Combined, “Mood” and “Valentino” soundtrack more than 2.7 million videos on the app. 
The top spot on the chart is just one of many achievements 24kGoldn’s picked up this year. “Mood” has held the top spot on Spotify’s Global Top 200 Chart since Sept. 18, the day it displaced Cardi B and Megan Thee Stallion’s “WAP” from No. 1. In August, XXL revealed its highly anticipated 2020 Freshman Class cover story — an annual feature of the hottest rising acts in hip-hop — with 24kGoldn holding the coveted, fan-voted “10th Spot.” 
His forthcoming debut album “El Dorado” is expected to arrive early next year, preceded by two singles in December. Until then, “Mood” is streaming on all platforms.

USC has joined a lawsuit against the federal government following its proposal to amend the H-1B visa program, which permits highly skilled international individuals, including recently graduated international students and international faculty at USC, to remain in the United States to work. The new restrictions, announced by the departments of Homeland Security and Labor Oct. 6, will narrow the range of occupations eligible for the visa and modify wage requirements to encourage employers to focus on recruiting more American workers.
In an email to the USC community Monday, President Carol Folt said USC stands behind the international students that have come through its institution and the many others across the country. The University has joined the lawsuit alongside the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the National Association of Manufacturers, Plaintiff Presidents’ Alliance on Higher Education and Immigration and other leading institutions.
“Our country benefits immensely from the work of uniquely talented and innovative people who come from around the world,” Folt wrote in the letter. “At USC, H-1B visa holders use their highly specialized expertise and knowledge to advance work that fuels innovation, serves the public good, and saves lives.”
These new restrictions follow President Donald Trump’s June executive order that suspended entry to the United States for noncitizens with certain work-based visas, including the H-1B visa, through Dec. 31. The changes were intended to address the current unemployment rate among U.S. workers that has stemmed from the coronavirus pandemic and government action on its behalf, according to an Oct. 6 press release from DHS that cited the program’s primary function is to fill gaps in the workforce.
The lawsuit accuses the federal government of taking advantage of the unemployment situation to advance changes without the typical checks and balances. According to the lawsuit, the proposals passed through with expectations for public notice and comment waived, sidelining any public input on the grounds of the unemployment situation. 
“The good cause exception is not available when an agency is faced with an emergency, waits seven months (enough time to solicit comments), and then attempts to issue a rule without notice and comment,” the lawsuit reads.
The unemployment rate reached a high in April at 14.7%, an increase of more than 10 percentage points from before shutdown in March, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. The rate sat at 7.9% in September, continuing a downward trend that began in May.
As a proudly international institution, USC will continue to support the international scholars in its network, Folt wrote in her letter. The University currently represents more than 135 countries across students, faculty and staff, according to the lawsuit.
This is not the first time USC has entered a lawsuit regarding visa developments since the beginning of the coronavirus pandemic. In July, USC joined other universities in one after student visa holders were told that they would only be permitted to remain in the United States for school if they maintained at least one in-person class, which caused universities such as USC to scramble after many announced they would hold classes primarily online. Immigrations and Customs Enforcement rescinded its decision less than two weeks later following backlash.

JUST US, an app which helps people live stream interactions with law enforcement, began out of necessity for founder Charmine Davis. With a son nearing driving age, Davis was overwhelmed by the reality that one in 1,000 Black men in the United States are killed by the police. Giving her son independence as a mother meant living with that fear.  
With this in mind, Davis approached Candace Walker, a graduate student in the Iovine and Young Academy. After almost a year of market research and product development in the Academy’s Integrated Project Lab, JUST US was released in August. Davis and Walker — who was recently nominated for a dot.LA Social Justice Award for her work on JUST US — ultimately aimed to create a tool for community activism against police brutality.
“The most significant aspect of this app is that a mom can feel connected to her child,” Davis said. “If her child is in trouble  a mother would fly across the earth to get to her child …  It’s a mother’s biggest fear that their child would be hurt, and they didn’t hear them.”
This idea was crucial to the development of JUST US. The app, they knew, could give mothers peace of mind — both by creating a network of active bystanders and increasing accountability from law enforcement. It was key, though, that the app be simple to use and easy to access. Jay Clewis, the professor who led the team in the Integrated Project Lab, emphasized the importance of user experience in developing JUST US.
“Here’s the situation — I’m sitting in a car, I’m nervous,” Clewis said. “You don’t have the time and awareness to grab a phone and open an app and go through some complicated process. It had to be really simple to initiate.”
JUST US has three main functions: Help, Heads Up and Check In. After pre-selecting five designated contacts, the user can access the app entirely through voice commands. Saying “Hey Siri, check in,” should alert the designated contacts that the user is safe. Initiating the Heads Up feature starts a livestream and, for users who have subscribed, shares their location with a list of pre-selected contacts. If users feel they are in immediate danger, the ‘Help’ feature alerts all JUST US users in a two mile radius of the situation.
These functionalities are a result of multiple iterations of market research and product testing in the lab. The lab team, which Walker led starting in December 2019, ultimately aimed to equip Black and brown communities with the tools and information to affect change and increase accountability from law enforcement.
“That’s really the goal — to get our kids home safe, to get our loved ones home safe,” Walker said. “To basically be able to live without the fear, knowing whether or not we’ll make it back home.”
The team looked at hard research and data sets on police brutality and racial profiling but also communicated directly with the communities that JUST US would ultimately serve. 
From there, they created a low-fidelity prototype and gauged market response. After sending the plans to a team of developers in Ukraine, JUST US became available for purchase on Aug. 28 — the anniversary of Martin Luther King Jr.’s “I Have a Dream” speech. 
From the initial pitch to JUST US’s release, the supportive atmosphere within the Academy was essential to the success of the app, Walker and Clewis said. 
“It gives students who are very passionate, very socially aware and want to have a positive social impact — it gives them a really safe space to explore ideas,” Clewis said. “You can validate ideas before you spend a lot of time, effort and money building something.”
Having just been released for download in August, Clewis believes that JUST US still has room to grow and hopes that user feedback will allow the team to further the app’s potential. For Davis, the release of the app meant even more.
“It was a relief for me,” Davis said. “I talk to moms all the time and I hear their fears … [JUST US] has all the functions that I felt like it needed to meet the needs of a mother who wants her kids to be safe.”
Correction: A previous version of this article misidentified Charmine Davis as the co-founder when she is the founder. The Daily Trojan regrets this error.

While she may have been born in the wrong decade, Noa Zimmerman is by no means lost. The misplaced hippie did not begin her path toward becoming a musician when she was accepted into USC’s Thornton School of Music to major in popular music performance and music production. 
Instead, the drive toward creating music was instilled naturally into a young Zimmerman, whose childhood was composed of instruments in the living room and a family that loved to play them. 
“My parents played a lot of music when I was a kid and we had a piano in our living room and my older brother played guitar so it was just like music instruments all around,” Zimmerman said. “I just sort of naturally picked up the guitar [and] piano and yeah, it was just kind of what I gravitated towards.”
Zimmerman’s music fascination also came from discovering the famous English rock band, The Beatles, at a young age. Her 1960s-inspired sound stems from her love for the band — so much so that her friends describe her as a hippie in the wrong era. 
“When I was 11 years old, I was obsessed with The Beatles,” Zimmerman said. “I think that The Beatles have influenced so much of my life. Through their music, it really influenced mine and got me passionate [and] helped me learn guitar.” 
Now, as a Thornton senior, those musical seeds that were planted so long ago have organically grown into an ever-expanding repertoire of artistic projects. During her time at USC, Zimmerman has made an impression on Thornton’s popular music program chair, Patrice Rushen. 
“Noa has always been very studious. She started off very shy and I think as she gave herself permission to allow her artistry and her interests to find their path,” Rushen said. “What’s been so beautiful is that her passion for the music has created a platform for her to be able to explore some of the other things in life she really cares about.” 
Zimmerman may sound like the next “Folklore”-era Taylor Swift, but she is in fact, the first Noa Zimmerman. The latest fruits of Zimmerman’s work are two new singles, titled “Palindrome King” and “Invisible Strings,” which were released Oct. 7. 
In “Palindrome King,” an ode to the slanted nature of our emotional inclinations, Zimmerman explores the difficulty of seeing circumstances straight when the subjectivity of feeling clouds the reality of life’s ups and downs. Rather than wallowing in life’s sorrows and rejoicing in its triumphs, “Palindrome King” promotes the feeling of something in the middle. The song is delicate in its acoustics, with gentle vocal slides that lend to the feeling of floating up and down. 
With the song’s surreal crafting, Zimmerman develops a profound message: Without life’s lows, we cannot appreciate the highs, and without the light, we would not recognize when we slip into the dark. Despite the constantly shifting state of things, the song points to the importance of maintaining an internal balance that prioritizes self-peace. 
“It’s like trying to find a balance within yourself, like realizing that without the happiness and the joy, you won’t have the darkness,” Zimmerman said. “But without the darkness you won’t have the happiness and joy.”
The crux of the song’s message is delivered powerfully at the end of every chorus: “Without light there’d be no shadow / Without high there’d be no below.”
“Invisible Strings” expresses a similarly dreamlike analysis of the human attempt to make sense of the world and our existence within it. Drawing inspiration from her studies in Hinduism and Buddhism, Zimmerman develops a spiritual take on seeing the world for what it truly is: something much smaller than we tend to view it. 
Zimmerman plays with the idea of our seamless relationship to the world we live in — rather than being just a tiny part of it, we are connected to it and each other all at once. 
The idea of “Invisible Strings” is best captured by Zimmerman herself, who explained that “nothing’s as big as you think it is … you are nothing and you are infinity and you are part of everything.”  
These two new singles are only a glimpse into the collection of Noa Zimmerman’s music. For someone raised in an environment of artistic expression, Zimmerman certainly has the work ethic to show for it. Two previous albums can be found on Zimmerman’s Spotify page, and additional releases can be tracked throughout her Instagram posts. Her folky, delicate sound is present in all of her songs, and the masterful lyricism is always stunning. 
“I think she became aware of how fearless she could be,” Rushen said. “What I love about Noa is over time she definitely embraced that so she in a very quiet way has developed a certain kind of acknowledgement that I really respect.” 
Writing and playing songs is not where Zimmerman’s contribution to the artistic community stops. Zimmerman recently co-headed the creation of a nonprofit organization that aims to connect artists who specialize in activism. The idea for the nonprofit, brilliantly titled as the Artivist Foundation, began among the protests and calls for justice that erupted during quarantine. 
The Artivist Foundation’s team consists of 13 members, some of whom Zimmerman considers to be her best friends. The camaraderie between the artists behind the Artivist Foundation is a huge part of their cohesiveness as an organization. Emily Goniea, a co-founder of the Artivist Foundation and student at NYU, is not only a business partner to Zimmerman but has also been her lifelong best friend. 
“She is the closest thing I will ever have to a sister,” Goniea said. “It is difficult to explain our friendship because I think not a lot of people are lucky enough to have a close friendship the way that we do in their lives. I feel really lucky to have had her in my life.” 
Though the Artivist Foundation plans to expand its operations to more artists, the nonprofit is still in the early stages of its development. The organization has focused on a project called Collective, which aims to connect artists through social media, allowing them to sell or collaborate on art projects. Looking forward, they hope to provide a space for artists to connect on both local and global levels, and provide these artists with the resources they need to make their voices heard above the stifling and saturated landscape of social media. 
“We want [artists] to get their voices out there in a way that current social media platforms stifled because there’s so much oversaturation and they don’t really reward authenticity and creativity,” Zimmerman said.“We want to create an alternative platform that’s a really specific environment and space for people who are passionate about creativity and social action.”
Zimmerman recognizes the importance of art in moments like this in history when demands for change must reach all varieties of audiences and communities. The Artivist Foundation hopes to amplify the voices of artists who are trying to use their work to reach those audiences and communities, as they call for social, racial, environmental and economic justice.
Goniea is also Zimmerman’s biggest cheerleader; the love between the two friends is palpable. Goniea admires Zimmerman’s authenticity and determination in her pursuit of music. 
“She is one of the most hardworking people I have ever known, especially when it comes to music,” Goniea said. “She has always been incredibly disciplined when it comes to practicing, playing and writing even when she was younger.”   
Though Zimmerman’s soul is one straight out of the sixties, her drive toward creating will prove instrumental in the decade to come. At the start of the 2020s, when the need for art that uplifts and encourages positive change is so crucial, Zimmerman will continue to meet the challenge with her gracefully devoted desire to create.

This week we discuss the new HBO Sports documentary “The Weight of Gold,” which focuses on mental health issues faced by Olympic athletes. Through one-on-one interviews, you hear from some of the most accomplished and visible athletes in the world including Michael Phelps, Apolo Ohno and Lolo Jones, who discuss the mental health challenges that they have dealt with as athletes. 
Aidan Berg: I had my qualms about this documentary, but I’m going to start with what I thought was the best and most impactful aspect: the brutality of the interviewees’ answers. “The Weight of Gold” features a ton of star power with former Olympians Michael Phelps (who also narrates — I’ll get to that later), Apolo Ohno, Shaun White, Gracie Gold and others. So their words about depression, not getting the help they needed and not being paid carry even more significance.
Lauren Mattice: There’s definitely some sort of … I don’t know whether to call it a confrontation or something else? Like these athletes are the ones we grew up watching, adoring and emulating before I think most of us understood mental health in a more introspective way. And as I was watching, I took a second to think, “Where do I know them from?” Like, it was never outside the context of sports or product endorsements, and that erased a lot of humanity from them. I remember a whole segment at the height of Phelps’ career where the commentators described why his body was made specifically for swimming, listing off measurements of his wingspan and leg strength, and I might as well have been hearing someone describe a robot athlete. 
AB: I also saw some issues with the cast, though. Firstly, it’s virtually all white athletes, which feels really wrong. And while the notoriety of every interviewee does add something, it also erases some of the impact of the message. Yes, even the biggest stars go through a lot of horrible experiences, but what about the U.S. athletes who never even make it that far? There was a point when Ohno was talking about how no one cares if you don’t win a gold, and if you don’t medal you’re practically worthless; the entire time I was thinking “I’d like to hear about this from the perspective of someone who isn’t the most decorated Winter Olympic athlete in U.S. history.” And I think it’s a larger issue with the film: The subjects have received so many accolades that it’s hard to relate at times.
LM: You’re right, it is incredibly and painfully white. Going back to this idea of humanizing athletes again, this whole documentary ignores aspects of mental health related to racism and bigotry. Take Fox News executive vice president John Moody’s column talking point that he wrote ahead of the 2018 Winter Games: “Unless it’s changed overnight, the motto of the Olympics, since 1894, has been ‘Faster, Higher, Stronger.’ It appears that the U.S. Olympic Committee would like to change that to ‘Darker, Gayer, Different.’ If your goal is to win medals, that won’t work.” I think almost every athlete would prove that wrong. These aren’t competitions to just be won, they are culminations of hard work, failure, commitment and tenacity that are inextricably linked to identity and mental health — and this doc definitely failed to highlight that. 
AB: I thought the best question raised in the film was the “Now what?” that comes about following an Olympics. It spoke more to me than the idea that the hard and singularly-focused work Olympians do really affects them later in life because you have to work hard if you want to do anything impactful in this world. But the idea that all those years of work could come down to about 40 seconds and then after that, even if you accomplished your goal, everything else seems to lose significance because you’ve already been at the mountaintop. That is more specifically applicable to Olympians who only get their shot every four years.
LM: That’s tough to contend with because personally, I’m not an Olympian and I can’t ever be in their shoes. What do you do? You can’t say “Well why don’t you do something else?” because they’ve been working up to that moment for years (not that they don’t have other projects going on simultaneously that fulfill them). I will think this answer or this concept can be revealed with the addition of karate, surfing and skateboarding to the Summer Olympics lineup. They’re sports that in some shape or form focus on longevity and carry an additional recreational component that can live beyond competition. 
AB: There are a few filmmaking things I want to get your thoughts on, Lauren. The first is the creepy piano music and slow-mo black and white shots of Phelps spliced throughout the film. I know we’re dealing in serious subject matter, but that made it feel like a horror movie or something, and I didn’t really think it jived with the rest of the doc. I also thought Phelps’ narration was pretty awkward and clunky at times, although he was better in those talking-head interviews. I think he hit his stride more at the end when he was talking about his own journey and about the trend of Olympian suicides, but it was hard for me to get into it at the beginning.
LM: I was thinking the same, like why would you want to go with the dreadful and morbid approach to issues of mental health, like seriously? Depression manifests in myriad ways for different people, and this framing seemed to brush it with one general stroke. I can’t decide whether it worked as well for the portrayal of Steven Holcomb and Jeret Peterson’s lives. Those sorts of formal decisions should, and I hope were, approved and made by their family and friends. You’re asking a lot of these athletes to speak candidly about their very private experiences, but complete despair was not the thread to connect them. 
AB: I know one of the complaints reviewers had was that the hourlong run time was too short to deal with such complex and important subject matter, and I think this film could have solved a lot of its issues if it was longer. They could have included a more diverse array of athletes and they could have given more time to the specific changes they’d like to see made. If I’m being honest, this felt like I was being bludgeoned over the head with repeated tragic stories without much resolution about how it could be fixed, and while providing a platform for venting is worthwhile, I also would have liked to hear more about ideas for improvement from people who experienced first-hand how problematic the U.S. Olympic culture is.
LM: It felt a lot like the only way the creators thought we could relate to these athletes or feel sorry for them was to be inundated with stories of their trauma, and that is so, so tired. We’ve seen it especially for athletes of color outside of the Olympics for professional drafting and such, and frankly, though Phelps is one of the executive producers on this project, I don’t think that framing was thought through enough, if at all. “Now what?” Yes! Now what! The opportunity was there to discuss it, and if there isn’t another follow-up to this or some other type of media that addresses this question, it might be lost in other media coverage for a long time to come.

With a maximalist creative approach, Omar Apollo is the all-encompassing trailblazer of the times. Carving out space for himself, the 23-year-old Indiana native continues to evolve behind the possibility of imagination.
The long-awaited project “Apolonio” was released Friday. Running a brief 25 minutes, the nine-track album is a delineating representation of genuine musical incorporation. Backed by Warner Records, the project delivers nuanced insights into Apollo’s ability to develop cross-genre sounds. Apollo’s tentativeness allows the record to be saturated with his newfound vulnerability.
After a summer of one-off releases, including “Frío” and “Hit Me Up,” a collaboration with Dominic Fike and producer Kenny Beats, the project comes highly anticipated. 
A crucial part of the process remains genuine collaboration. “Apolonio” features production collaborations with the likes of The Strokes’ guitarist Albert Hammond Jr. and long-time associates Teo Halm and Mk.gee, whose eccentric influences are easy to spot.
The critically-acclaimed DJ Dahi and Michael Uzowuru further elevate the songs by fortifying Apollo’s unique sounds. Alongside notable mix engineer Jeff Ellis, the songs prove clean-cut while remaining true to the project’s grit. And with the aid of multimedia creatives Aiden Cullen and Clayborne Bujorian, the vibrant sounds of “Apolonio” manifest themselves in stunning visuals.
The opening track “I’m Amazing” sets up the disposition for the rest of the project. Paired with circular piano melodies and sharp drum samples, the track replicates the roundabout feelings expressed in the lyrics. The subtle incorporation of Spanish lines speaks to Apollo’s authenticity. 
Utilizing experimental falsettos and layered vocals, Apollo showcases his bold ability in his latest single, “Want U Around (feat. Ruel).” The result is an unmatched arrangement between the two dusty vocalists.
While a striking project, there are a couple of tracks that pail in comparison to the rest. Just under two minutes, the soft-focus song “Hey Boy (feat. Kali Uchis)” feels grossly underdeveloped. While the short duration is off-putting, the track makes up for it, closing with unexpected low-reverb ad-libs. 
And the pacing feels sluggish at moments in the mumble rap inspired track “Bi Fren.” While the eclectic sound effects are a subtle nicety, it relies too heavily on Apollo’s vocal plays to balance the seemingly monotonous back track.
Embracing his Mexican heritage, Apollo delves into his take on a modern corrido with “Dos Uno Nuevo (219).” The original song debuted on Sept. 26 at a digital festival at The Ford in partnership with Solidarity For Sanctuary. 
Accompanied by members of the Los Angeles Philharmonic, Apollo made history marking the first time members of the LA Phil played a corrido. The heavy traditional plucks provide a stark contrast to the flashy lyrics. The radical yet effortless manner in which Apollo maneuvers both the traditional and new is commendable.
Within the project, the standout track is “Useless,” which features the signature textured guitar riffs, courtesy of Hammond Jr., which pairs incredibly with Apollo’s processed vocal harmonies. The spindly notes with the shifting tone of the bass tie the dense track together.
At the same caliber is the closing track “The Two of Us.” While only composed of four-lines repeating lines, the song never bores as a playful guitar solo and steady bass lines move it forward. And the sound of funky Clavinet-inspired keyboards provide a playfulness to the reflective sentiment in the lyrics.
In the modern era, Apollo represents the narrative of the American Dream. In an interview with GQ, Apollo spoke of his hometown Hobart, Indiana and the often numbing environment it produces. 
“I didn’t want to be a role model, but I did want people to know that you can get the fuck out of here if you want,” Apollo said. As he has solidified his creative direction, the rising artist has pulled himself and his peers through the ranks.
The debut project invites listeners to indulge in the special visions of Omar Apollo. “Apolonio” marks a creative and musical development in the rising artist. With hypnotizing harmonies and equally captivating production, Apollo strikes a perfect balance in cross-pollinating genres. The innovative genre-flitting allows the work to stand out as meticulously curated and carefully executed. 
Apollo is the result of a culture he has made for himself. With this new development of heightened brazen lyricism and slick funk-pop influences, the man is an icon in the making. Needless to say, this is only the beginning for Apollo.
“Apolonio” is now available on all streaming platforms under exclusive license to Warner Records.

I loved “Crazy Rich Asians.” I loved “Crazy Rich Asians” for the story and the music and so many of its other qualities but primarily because its protagonist, Rachel Chu (Constance Wu), was a Chinese American facing conflict over her identity. I loved “Crazy Rich Asians,” the way I loved “The Farewell,” which similarly featured a Chinese American woman, Billi (Awkwafina), as the protagonist grappling with different cultural values. I loved both films in a way that only Chinese Americans can love films about what it means to be Chinese American. 
Looking at hard statistics, it wasn’t just me who loved these films. “Crazy Rich Asians,” according to The Hollywood Reporter, was the most successful rom-com in nine years at the United States box office. According to Forbes, “The Farewell” was a U.S. box-office success as well, demonstrating the extent to which a Chinese American film telling a uniquely Chinese American story can achieve economic success in America.
Yet “Crazy Rich Asians” was a flop in mainland China. So was “The Farewell,” which accounted for only 1% of China’s total screenings on opening day. In essence, the failure of both Chinese American films to appeal to Chinese audiences speaks to a larger question of cultural belonging. Chinese reviewers labeled “Crazy Rich Asians” as “insulting the Chinese.” 
Others implied that “Crazy Rich Asians” was clearly an “American” film and that the story was much too “foreign” for Chinese audiences. Despite the fact that Chinese American filmmaker Jon M. Chu directed it, Chinese viewers largely derided the film for what they perceived to be its lack of “authenticity” for Chinese identity. 
“The Farewell” experienced a similar response, with Chinese audiences finding the film’s rendering of Chinese American identity challenging to relate to and not genuinely Chinese. Yet “The Farewell,” for all its success in the United States as a Chinese American film, didn’t seem to be “American” enough for the United States either. The film was nominated as “Best Motion Picture, Foreign Language” in the 2020 Golden Globes. 
Director Lulu Wang expressed her thoughts on the categorization, stating that when she originally pitched her idea for the film, she was told that it was “too Asian” to cater to a U.S. audience and “too Westernized” for an Asian audience. She was asked to change the film according to which audience she wanted to appeal to. Such conflict, Wang reflected, demonstrated a willingness to conform to a reductionist view of Chinese American identity.
Others had similar thoughts. “Wow,” wrote Twitter user @robotpotatoes, “The Farewell as Foreign Language Film? I know qualification includes % of the film spoken in English…but context here absolutely matters when the story revolves around a Chinese AMERICAN family.”
Given the intersection of Chinese American identity with art, the question of a film’s “foreignness” and global appeal appears to reflect a larger disparity in international box offices. Yet it’s also a question of the authenticity of transnational storytelling, and how in many ways, the debates over audience, culture and storytelling parallel the debates over what it means to be Chinese American. 
When I see debates over a Chinese American film’s “foreignness” in both China and the United States, I’m reminded of these feelings I have about belonging and not feeling “enough.” In many ways, popular discourse surrounding these films parallels discourse surrounding Chinese American identity. It’s an established concept for Chinese Americans that one often feels either too “Chinese” to be American or too “American” to be Chinese, never truly fitting in anywhere. 
It’s no surprise, then, that this conflict has projected itself onto the nature of films. When Chinese Americans are constantly made to feel “foreign,” no matter what country we’re in, that same line of thinking takes shape in responses to the stories we tell. We are told to consider our “audience” and to choose a side when in reality, we belong to both cultures and countries — to choose one would be to lose part of ourselves in the process. 
Instead of asking whether or not a film appeals to either Chinese or U.S. audiences, debates over the perceived “authenticity” of a film must consider the unique audience of Chinese Americans. If we consider authenticity as a form of truth, then we must also realize that truth is inherently subjective. Chinese Americans have our own truths about how we see our “Chinese-ness” and “American-ness.” Chinese American films are authentic in ways that only Chinese American films can be. We have our own ideas of what it means to belong, and I would argue that there is space to tell true stories just as Chinese Americans see them for Chinese Americans. 
My intention isn’t to invalidate criticism of both films, as to do so would undermine the very cultural differences that I’ve grown up questioning. However, nothing is ever truly one-dimensional, and we need space for Chinese American stories. 
Maybe it’s unlikely for a Chinese American film to truly resonate with both Chinese and U.S. audiences, to somehow have that quality that perfectly appeals to both cultures. The fact that we still haven’t gotten to that point yet shows Chinese Americans that there might never be a perfect balance between both of these parts of ourselves, and maybe that’s OK. We can learn so much about ourselves when we’re still questioning who we are, and that might just be what belonging is: having that possibility to define ourselves just as we want, without fear of whether or not we’re appealing to one side or the other. 
It’s because, not in spite of, our identities that Chinese Americans have such dynamic ways of seeing our own truths through storytelling. As such, we need Chinese American films for Chinese Americans because these films can teach us what it means to belong. Most importantly, though, Chinese American stories let us see ourselves for ourselves in all our nuances, as brilliant and complex as Chinese Americans are.

What is happening in the Caucasus?
It’s a question that I hope most Californians with an internet connection and a shred of empathy have asked themselves over the past several weeks. Our state is home to a vibrant community of over 200,000 Armenian Americans, by far the largest of any other state. As a result, for a significant portion of Californians, especially Angelenos, the sheer size of the community means that its members are frequently classmates, neighbors and pillars of local communities. In light of the destruction and violence presumably facing their extended families abroad, it stands to reason that the conflict in the Caucasus should be at the top of Californians’ political radar. 
Unfortunately, this doesn’t seem to be the case. 
For months now, my social media feed has been virtually flooded with various forms of activism. If you’re a 20-something in Los Angeles, you probably know what I’m talking about — endless resource guides, petitions and informational graphics. For the most part, the trend feels like a welcome and positive development. While keeping concerns regarding performatism in mind, it feels safe to say that the more people learning and speaking out against injustice, the better. 
However, when it comes to the conflict in Caucasus and the spectre of ethnic-cleansing against Armenians that comes with it, social media appears notably muted on the subject. Whereas for months, everyone and their dog felt compelled to signal their position on a whole range of complex issues (from democratic-socialism to the plight of Uighurs in Xinjiang), now, as a community fights for its existence, what was once a downpour of goodwill and activism is now a barren desert of willful disinterest. 
Twitter and Instagram are not and should not be California’s official barometer for public concern. Still, the platforms can provide useful insights into the ebbs and flows of popular attitudes and opinions. As previously mentioned, so far these insights suggest that Californians aren’t necessarily antagonistic toward any of the relevant parties involved in the Caucasus — they just don’t really care or know what’s happening in the first place. 
What is most concerning, however, is that this apathy is unsurprising. It is not just emblematic of a Californian shortcoming but of a deeply concerning national shortcoming: Americans’ apathy for foreign policy. 
The United States has been the single most influential and impactful actor in the realm of foreign affairs for over seven decades. In the aftermath of World War II, it was the United States that built the postwar international order. The United States has written the world’s rulebook since then and it’s been their decisions that have shaped the fate of countless nations since then, for better and for worse.
In light of U.S. power and the democratic processes that underpin American power, one would imagine that its citizenry would be adequately informed and cognizant of international developments, given the responsibility it holds. After all, we elect the leaders that have waged cold wars, hot wars and trade wars and we will continue to do so. 
Despite this responsibility, a dangerous amount of ignorance permeates the U.S. electorate. In a 2017 Pew Research Study, only 60% of Americans knew that Britain was leaving the European Union and less than half of Americans could name the U.S. Secretary of State. 
Democracies can only function effectively if their citizenry is informed and clearly, the U.S. citizenry isn’t holding up its end of the bargain. 
There is an argument to be made for rational ignorance here. Given the abundance of more pressing, everyday challenges, especially in the midst of a pandemic, it makes sense why Americans wouldn’t take their time to learn about what is happening in a far-flung region of the world. However, there is a threshold at which rational ignorance becomes dangerous ignorance and in the case of the conflict in the Caucasus, dangerous ignorance could mean the difference between a neighbor’s family living or dying. 
At the end of the day, this column is supposed to be California-centric, so I’ll close with this. 
California leads. We lead on the national stage, with Californians serving as both House Minority leader and Speaker of the House. We lead in setting the policy agenda for the rest of the country. California was the first state to approve a $15 minimum wage and the state’s environmental policies are the most ambitious in the country. However, we do not lead in foreign policy interest. Data collected over the course of the past 16 years reveals that when it comes to Google searches within the topic of “Foreign Policy,” California is outpaced by 19 other U.S. States and U.S. territories. The same data also reveals that we have led the nation in searches for “Keeping Up with the Kardashians” over the same period of time. 
California ascending past the likes of Washington D.C. in foreign policy interest will not end the violence in the Caucusus. Neither will an influx of social media activism. In reality, it would be inappropriate of me to even suggest I know the solution to the threat Armenia faces. However, U.S. leadership has the power to both inflame and ameliorate the conflict, and if we expect our nation to do the latter, it will require a fundamental shift and improvement in the way Americans understand their place and influence in the world. As with many other aspects of U.S. life, hopefully California will be leaders on this front as well.

As we head into Week 7 of the NFL season, former Trojans on both sides of the ball are beginning to solidify themselves as impact players. With our last update coming in from Week 2, it’s been four weeks since we last checked in on USC football alumni at the next level. 
While some teams have had their schedules adjusted due to the coronavirus, the season is nearly half complete. Here are the USC alumni having the most notable seasons thus far.
Ronald Jones II
The Trojan who’s had arguably the best time since we last checked in is Tampa Bay Buccaneers running back Ronald Jones. In the four games since, he’s run the ball 73 times, accumulating 383 yards and two touchdowns on the ground and an additional 64 yards receiving. 
Jones has asserted himself as the top back in Tampa Bay, racking up three straight games with at least 100 yards rushing. Jones is the first Buccaneer running back to accomplish that feat since Doug Martin in 2015.
Jones sits comfortably at 472 rushing yards through six games, good enough for an average of 78.7 per game compared to just 45.3 a year ago.
Robert Woods
Los Angeles Rams receiver Robert Woods has continued his steady production under head coach Sean McVay in Los Angeles. In three games since our last check-in, Woods has caught 15 passes for 181 yards and two touchdowns. 
Woods’ skillset was on full display as he hauled in a 56-yard touchdown pass in a win over the Washington Football Team in Week 5. Woods sits at 365 all-purpose yards through five games. 
Nelson Agholor
In our Week 2 update, we noted Agholor needed to prove himself on a one-year deal under head coach Jon Gruden this season. He got off to an impressive start, catching a touchdown in his first game, but quickly cooled off with just three catches over the next two games.
Agholor seems to have found his big play ability once again in recent weeks. Agholor caught a touchdown in Las Vegas’ spirited comeback attempt against Buffalo. Then, in the Raiders’ surprise win over defending Super Bowl champion Kansas City Chiefs, Agholor brought in a 59-yard touchdown pass for his third touchdown reception of the young season, equaling his total with Philadelphia last season.
Chuma Edoga
After missing the first two games of the season, Edoga joined the New York Jets offense in Week 3. Since his return, the former third-round pick appeared in and started three games before leaving a Week 6 contest against the Miami Dolphins with what the team classified as a calf injury. Edoga will undergo further evaluation as Week 7 progresses.
Sam Darnold
Things have not gotten much better for Darnold and the Jets since our update in the second week of the season. Darnold combined for one touchdown and three interceptions in two games before suffering a shoulder injury on a hit. 
Darnold has not suited up for New York since the injury and the team remains bullish on when the signal-caller and former third overall pick will return to action, although signs point to a return in the coming weeks.
Everson Griffen
Defensive end Everson Griffen has had mixed results in his first season with the Dallas Cowboys. While he has not matched the production of his peak years in Minnesota, Griffen has enjoyed a solid role in the Dallas defense. 
While the unit as a whole has struggled, Griffen has racked up 1.5 sacks and 14 total tackles over five games. Although it’s not particularly woeful, Dallas will be looking to get more from a player who combined for 26.5 sacks over the past three seasons.
Injury Update
Since the Week 2 update, the following USC alumni were placed on injured reserve: Tyron Smith (Dallas Cowboys), Jurrell Casey (Denver Broncos), Michael Pittman Jr. (Indianapolis Colts), Austin Jackson (Miami Dolphins), Rasheem Green (Seattle Seahawks) and Zach Banner (Pittsburgh Steelers). 
Tennessee Titans cornerback Adoree Jackson remains on injured reserve after suffering an injury prior to the start of the season. Baltimore Ravens cornerback Iman Marshall and Minnesota Vikings linebacker Cam Smith remain on injured reserve since their designations prior to the season.
