 
Andy Enfield knew things would be different as early as last August, when the men’s basketball team took a trip to Italy and went 4-0 in three exhibition games and a scrimmage.
Then they came back to prepare for the season and Enfield grew even more confident.
“In the preseason we had a couple of scrimmages and liked what we saw as far as the commitment of our players to being a team, to sharing the ball offensively, to playing team defense, to really having an attitude and a commitment to putting the team before themselves as individuals,” Enfield said.
The pieces are starting to come together for USC in Enfield’s third season, with the team sporting a 17-5 record and a 6-3 mark in conference play, good enough for second in the Pac-12 conference.
Regardless of how this season ends, it will be a vast improvement from the 23-41 overall record from the previous two seasons, where the Trojans managed just five conference wins combined and a mere .500 record at home. This season, the Men of Troy are a perfect 13-0 at home — the first time that has happened since 1943.

“We’re excited that we’re competitive this year,” Enfield said. “We know we can win games. We didn’t make goals before the season — how many games we wanted to win or how many league games or out-of-conference. We just decided to focus on the process versus the results.”
Seeing results as the process moves along is a bonus. It hasn’t always been this way for USC, where basketball is generally an afterthought and the Galen Center is more often than not half filled during games. The last time the Trojans won their conference was more than 30 years ago. They’ve had two Sweet Sixteen appearances in the past half-century and last made the Final Four during the Eisenhower administration.
But Enfield makes it clear that there is much work to be done.
“We have a long way to go,” he said. “We’re young. We have one senior on our roster. All the players have room for improvement —— significant improvement. As a team, we can get a lot better.”
That senior, Strahinja Gavrilovic, is averaging 1.6 points and hasn’t played in the last nine games. Suffice to say, the Trojans are still young, raw and learning how to embrace a winning culture.
“When Andy Enfield came to USC he made a conscious decision to build the program from the bottom up, bringing in high-level recruits and developing them for the future,” the Trojans’ 2015-2016 media guide reads. “The belief is that the future is now.”
In other words, don’t judge Enfield by the 5-31 conference record in his first two seasons. Start judging him now, with his recruits, his team and his system running in full force.
“We didn’t have a time frame,” Enfield said, when asked if he thought it would take a couple of years to start winning. “Our goal as a coaching staff was to try to come in and make this a better program every week, every month we were here. We continually try to do that.”
Enfield came to USC from Florida Gulf Coast, where he had coached just two seasons, but burst onto the national scene when the Eagles — nicknamed “Dunk City” — went on an improbable run in the NCAA Tournament in 2013, becoming the first No. 15 seed to reach the Sweet Sixteen.
He was immediately hired at USC to transform a struggling program that was going through its second coaching change in a year.
But the Cinderella magic in Florida wasn’t going to transfer to California, at least not right away. The chemistry wasn’t right and it showed on and off the court. The Trojans finished last in the Pac-12 with just two conference wins in Enfield’s first season.
“My freshman year we had a lot of negative energy with certain players and so it seemed just strenuous,” junior guard Julian Jacobs told the Los Angeles Times last month. “There were multiple times during my freshman year when we really didn’t want to come to practice because we were in last place and guys didn’t really get along.”
Enfield understands the frustration but lauds his players and coaching staff for staying the course, even through some rough periods.
“Whenever you first start something, you go through some down times,” Enfield said. “You have failures and you hope the successes come later. Sure, it’s not fun losing a lot of games but our players and our staff have not lost sight of our main goal. Sometimes it’s not fun to go through the process of getting better. There’s frustration that sets in. Everyone wants to be a champion as soon as possible, and it doesn’t always work like that.”
Enfield praised Jacobs and Nikola Jovanovic, both juniors, for playing key roles into committing to the process. Because of that, Enfield and his staff have been able to build around them in their two recruiting classes with a few standout additions in sophomore Jordan McLaughlin in 2014 and freshmen Bennie Boatwright and Chimezie Metu this season.
One sign the environment has changed is the camaraderie on the team. Instead of being a toxic environment, practice is now something everyone looks forward to.
“The last thing you want to do as a player or a coach is show up to practice and be miserable,” Enfield said. “We’re on the other side. We really enjoy it.”
But Enfield makes it clear that the team’s work is far from over. He doesn’t want to send the impression that the team “has arrived” or “accomplished something” because he doesn’t believe they have. He acknowledges the upset over No. 20 Wichita State, the four-overtime signature victory against No. 7 Arizona and the convincing win at UCLA, but he is careful to note that nine conference games remain, and each opponent is only worth one win or loss.
What he will say, though, is that he is proud of his players for being committed and building a winning team culture, working toward the same objective.
“Our players want to be great,” Enfield said. “They want to have something special. It’s not hard when you have a goal that everyone wants. You just have to figure out how to get there.”

Football is by far the most popular sport in America. Millions of Americans tune in to watch the gridiron sport every Sunday. In fact, all of the top 12 shows of the fall 2015 season were NFL games. As Alec Baldwin said in the movie Concussion, “The NFL owns a day of the week, the same one that the church used to own.”
In the movie, Will Smith plays Dr. Bennet Omalu, the founder of the disease Chronic Traumatic Encephalopathy. Omalu found the disease in the brains of two former NFL stars, Mike Webster and Terry Long and published his report with the help of the University of Pittsburgh. Instead of receiving the credit and attention that he deserved, Omalu was accused by many fans and the NFL of making up the disease to destroy the sport.
It took the NFL almost four years to admit there was a link between playing football and suffering concussions after Omalu published his first report in 2005. Public outcry didn’t reach its peak until 2013, when CTE was found in NFL legend Junior Seau’s brain after he committed suicide at the age of 43.
The Super Bowl is the NFL’s most cherished moment, a once-a-year extravaganza that shows off the best the sport has to offer. This upcoming Sunday will be the 50th anniversary of the Super Bowl. Over 115 million American viewers are expected to tune into the game to watch the Denver Broncos take on the Carolina Panthers at Levi’s Stadium. Fans are paying a minimum of $850 just to get into the stadium, and companies are spending almost $5 million dollars for a 30-second ad spot. The NFL has truly become the strongest business in America.
However, despite all of the success that the NFL has accomplished both on and off the field, the concussion issue continues to hinder the league. We are all part of the problem. As fans we live for the big hit, that certain hit that makes you jump out of your seat and “ooooh man.” Physicality is what makes the NFL what it is. Take away the big hits and it is nothing more than a glorified flag football game.
But at some point a line has to be drawn. Last Friday the NFL released its statistics on injuries during the 2015 season. The NFL reported that the number of concussions during the 2015 season rose a staggering 58 percent to 182 reported concussions.
To put that number into perspective, as of May 2014 the NBA only reported 89 concussions total since the 2008 season. Even the NHL, one of the biggest contact sports out there, reported only 53 concussions during the 2014 seasons. The NFL has a huge concussion problem that it simply will not address.
One of the biggest reasons why the NFL continues to ignore the concussion crisis is the simple fact that people keep coming to games. There’s something about watching 250-pound men crash into each other that sparks the American interest. Even the fact that Roger Goodell has proven to be vastly incapable as a commissioner, botching almost every major decision he has made, can’t keep people away.
As a lifelong Raiders fan, I always considered the NFL to be my backup sport to watch because well, the Raiders have been awful my entire life. I often stuck to watching the NBA and NCAA football. I never realized the power that the NFL had until I watched the movie Concussion — which if you have not seen, you should immediately.
Since 2009, more than 5,000 former NFL players have sued the organization for failing to protect them while they were playing. The players suffer from debilitating headaches, Alzheimer’s snd other serious brain problems. The NFL reached an agreement in 2015 to pay each retired NFL player up to $5 million dollars “for serious medical conditions associated with repeated head trauma.”
One of the issues that plagues CTE is the fact that it can only be found after an individual has passed away. However, in September 2015 PBS released a study that stated Boston University had found CTE in over 96 percent of former NFL players. In total, the researchers have found CTE in the brains of 131 out of 165 people who have played football at some point in their life, whether it was high school, college or professional.
As much as these new findings on concussions has inspired me to write about the problem, I will most likely be watching the Super Bowl on Sunday. The NFL has become a staple in the American lifestyle and shows no signs of slowing down. A real solution needs to be put in place before more young men continue to die from the disease.
Nick Barbarino is a senior majoring in business administration. His column, “Beyond the Arc,” runs Tuesdays.
so tired of this bs, since almost a hundred years ago people have known that concussions can cause permenant injury. read history of boxing and concussions. this is nothing new. Players know they risk more the just concussions and brain injuries when playing. broken bones, necks, paralysis, even death has occured. they still go out and play. even with all the stuff out now pretending this is a new thing they still go out and play. college kids declare for draft the minute they think they can get in and make money. you go to a game and tell any nfl player that hey, if you go out you could have a concussion and maybe get cte and brain damage, they gonna say oh, wow, never thought of that, never mind, i quit. no. they dont care. they want the money. and as far as im concerened thats why they make all that money. to cover health problems and everything so they dont have to work again for the rest of their lives. whats even more concerning is you cant find cte til after death, so all the people with their hands out looking for cash are families of dead players. the players new the risk, made their decisions. then after they die the families are looking for hand-outs for decisions the players made. ridiculous. people know the risk of drinking and driving, but if someone gets drunk and crashes and dies should their family be able to sue the alcohol companies for it? or if someone becomes an alcoholic and it destroys their family should they be able to sue the maker of their favorite beer?
Players know the risks. just like someone who drinks knows what could happen. problem is everyone has the, well, it wont happen to me attitude. thats not the NFL’s fault. Yet all we hear is how the nfl is causing this, the NFL needs to fix the problem. How is this their fault? they are constently coming up with new rules and better equipment to try and protect players, they pay the players millions of dollars and give them some of the best doctors money can buy, they are doing their fault. players need to start taking responsibility for their own choices and stop looking for handouts. and families need to stop trying to get free money of the choices of players. sorry, sounds harsh but its true. I dont here boxers and MMA fighters, hockey and rugby players, all who get concussions, sitting around whining and trying to get handouts. trying to say, oh, I never knew I could get brain damage from constantly getting hit in head.
So you want to write an article, why not write one about how the movie concussion lies, how if you look it up CTE was discovered long before the doctor in movie took credit for others findings. how players know the risk but still CHOOSE to play. if I choose to shot myself in the foot I cant sue the gun maker. write an article on the truths and choices of the matter and get over this trying to blame the nfl that does try to make the game safer for those that CHOOSE to play. when you show me a player that was forced by the nfl to declare for draft and then theyre forced at gunpoint to go out and get concussions, then write an article about how the nfl is responsible.
one other little tidbit I find ammusing. you even say in article how they are finding this in players that played high school and college footbal, so how is this all an nfl problem? why arnt people blaming the schools, or for that matter the parents who stick their kids in football at a young age. just the fact that the nfl is the only one ever blamed maybe shows this is all based on greed? go after the company that has money right, not the real problem. most of these players have had multiple concussions through pee-wee, middle school, high school, college, before they ever reach nfl, its even fair to say that alot of the complaining people may have a good chance of already having cte before ever playing a snap in nfl.

As the road to the White House kicked off in Iowa, students gathered at Tommy’s Place to follow the presidential contenders as they vied for caucus-goers in a live analysis and panel discussion.
The event, which featured panelists including former California State Sen. Tony Strickland, former Democratic Assemblywoman Cindy Montañez, USC College Democrats Vice President Nick Germain and second year USC Gould School of Law student and Republican Chase Bakaly, focused on the impact Iowa will have on the race going forward.
The discussion, moderated by Jesse M. Unruh Institute of Politics Director Dan Schnur and Daily Trojan Managing Editor Emma Peplow, began with predictions about what the caucus results would mean for the remainder of primary elections. Strickland predicted that Sen. Ted Cruz had the most at stake in the Republican race, highlighting the importance that Iowa will play in determining each party’s nominee.
““If [Cruz] is not successful here, I don’t see how he can pull off the nomination moving forward,” Strickland said. “If he can’t win in Iowa, it will be hard to see where he does win — other than in Texas.”
Germain noted that the results of the Democratic race might very well be determined by college-aged students.
“We see the establishment behind Clinton and progressives behind Sanders,” Germain said. “It depends how many college kids and high school seniors get out to vote.”
As early entrance polls came in showing Sen. Cruz and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton leading in Republican and Democratic polls, respectively, the panel discussed the rise of anti-establishment candidates. Strickland attributed the popularity of candidates like Donald Trump and Sen. Bernie Sanders to dissatisfaction on both sides of the aisle with regard to how things are done in Washington.
“I think the American people want something new,” Strickland said. “If you’re talking to a Democrat, they want someone more progressive. If you’re talking to a Republican, they want someone who is actually going to get things done.”
Montañez echoed these sentiments, emphasizing the important role new voters will play in the outcome of the caucus.
“The establishment helps determine elections in many different ways,” Montanez said. “The only way we change that is by getting new voters to polling locations.”
The panelists discussed what they described as a “civil war” within the Republican party, noting the distinctions between candidates such as Sen. Marco Rubio and Trump. Bakaly noted how Trump’s lead in Iowa could mark a change in the Republican party’s strategy moving forward.
“Cruz is running a traditional campaign, but Trump has only been to Iowa a handful of times,” Bakaly said. “We might see that the traditional way Republicans have won Iowa might be over if Trump wins.”
Strickland credited Trump’s substantial lead in the Republican party to opponents underestimating his popularity, cautioning Democrats against hoping that the Democratic candidate faces him in the general elections.
“I would argue that Donald Trump doesn’t have a Republican brand — he has a Trump brand that is not Republican,” Strickland said. “He has marketed his brand, Trump, as success.”
Looking forward to New Hampshire, the panel made predictions regarding what they think the parties will focus on going forward.
“From the Republican side in New Hampshire, it’s important to focus on if Marco Rubio can maintain the momentum,” Peplow said. “From the Democratic side, I’d be interested to see if Bernie Sanders can poll as closely to Hillary Clinton and keep up the grassroots support.”
Of the approximately 80 students in attendance, some said they had already decided who they will vote for. Petra Reyes, a sophomore majoring in political science who said she will vote for Sen. Sanders in the primary, said Sanders has the most to gain from the Iowa caucus .
“I think [Sanders] has a lot to gain if he wins Iowa, similarly to how Barack Obama won Iowa in 2008,” Reyes said. “It propelled him forward throughout the rest of the primaries.”
Luke Phillips, a senior majoring in international relations who has decided to vote for Sen. Marco Rubio in the primary, said he was not surprised by the early poll outcomes.
“The fact that Marco is trailing at third doesn’t surprise me at all,” Phillips said. “I don’t think the winners in the primaries are going to be the thing that determines who advances to the general election.”

Mindful USC, which started in the fall of 2014 as a budding initiative for mental and physical health, has grown exponentially this semester.
The program, guided interdisciplinarily by departments as disparate as the School of Cinematic Arts and the Office of Religious Life, has a full schedule of 13 classes being offered in the spring semester. Despite this expansion, the pursuit of Mindful USC is the same: to provide students with the tools for better stress management and to be able to experience and live in a moment.
In its infancy, Mindful USC carried out five-week courses in the Marshall School of Business and SCA. Expanding these piecemeal courses into full classes was a result of the immense success of the programs.
Allen Weiss, the co-chair for the Steering Committee of Mindful USC and professor in the Marshall School of Business, has taught at InsightLA for more than 10 years. He learned how to teach meditation at Spirit Rock Meditation Center. He said that the draw of mindfulness has many sources.
“The people come in because of anxiety, depression, a lot of self-judgment and just generally people feel that their life is just not settled down,” Weiss said. “Mindfulness helps to reduce all of that.”
Most of these classes are led by trained staff from InsightLA, a mindfulness meditation organization based in Santa Monica that is affiliated with Spirit Rock Meditation Center, the Center for Religion and Spirituality at Loyola Marymount University, the Insight Meditation Society, the Pediatric Pain Program at UCLA, the Innerkids Foundation and the Institute for Meditation and Psychotherapy.
As mindfulness has gained mainstream popularity and acceptance on the USC campus, students have found outlets to practice it further among the residential halls. Sophomore Peter Bergmann is a resident assistant in Birnkrant Residential College. He leads “Mindfulness Mondays” for his residents — a group mindfulness session that takes place at the beginning of the week. Bergmann notes that an initial common misconception about mindfulness is that it is too time-consuming.
“Everybody always has this idea that they don’t have time for mindfulness, that’s it going to take 30 minutes or an hour here and there,” Bergmann said. “The huge thing [my residents] get from it is that it’s bang for buck. You can spend five minutes doing some practices and it just really really gives you benefits throughout the day.”
A repeated benefit of mindfulness is the ability to perceive one’s emotions at a distance, according to Weiss.

 
“As human beings we have a tendency to just react to everything. We react to negative things that happen to us; we want to change things, we want to fix things, we don’t like the way things are, and we kind of go through life this way,” Weiss said. “But when you’re doing all of that, you’re not really seeing the world very clearly. When you practice being present for things as they are, you are building a skill that you can bring to bear.”
Senior Lillie Moffett is a resident assistant that also practices mindfulness with her residents. Emotional clarity is a huge benefit that she has seen in her participating residents.
“For one of my residents specifically, it was sort of a place for him to realize that he had problems that were deeper than could be solved through meditation,” Moffett said. “He realized that he needed to confront some problems that he was having. When you’re so busy, you are kind of ignoring the fact that you feeling a certain way, as opposed to when you have a space to stop, think and breathe.”
In her own life, Moffett has seen mindfulness help her focus on tasks and get more work done. But this skill is one that takes patience and can potentially take a long time to learn.
“I didn’t see effects for literally a year and a half. You have to practice, and it’s not going to come right away,” Moffett said.

More than 900 USC Keck School of Medicine healthcare workers will participate in a one-day strike on Feb. 10 to protest the low quality of benefits and wages that hinder their ability to provide care. These healthcare workers, represented by the National Union of Healthcare Workers, are joined in solidarity with 1,200 nurses that are part of the California Nurses Association, who will be holding an informational picket at the same time.
The complaints of the caregivers, are divided into three primary concerns: “staffing cuts that jeopardize patients, poverty wages and unaffordable health insurance, and inadequate and discriminatory retirement and tuition benefits,” according to a press release by the NUHW.
Healthcare workers claim that staffing cuts have rendered them both overworked and underpaid, leaving them in dire straits when it comes to providing adequate care. The NUHW’s press release very pointedly emphasizes Keck Medicine CEO Thomas Jackiewicz’s 30 percent pay raise, in addition to Keck Medicine’s 2015 employment of Huron Healthcare, a healthcare consultancy “dedicated to delivering best-in-class revenue enhancement, expense reduction and clinical transformation solutions,” according to its website. The criticism is that the Keck is spending more money trying to cut down on costs rather than sufficiently pay its workers.
According to the NUHW, of the 900 healthcare workers who are striking, “one of every six earns less than $15, and some earn as little as $10.15 an hour.” This requires many healthcare workers to rely on public assistance; for instance, a big concern is Keck’s expensive medical plan, which leaves workers forced to use Medi-Cal.
The third plank of the NUHW-led worker’s qualms involves the fact that Keck does not provide tuition assistance to its workers, which helps to financially assist the children of USC faculty who aim to study at USC. The workers claim that it also does not provide workers with a retirement plan that allocates a 5 percent 401(k) contribution.
Alex Corea, a respiratory therapist, union steward and bargaining team member relates a growing dissent with USC’s actions following the NUHW’s split with the Service Employees International Union.
“When USC took over, we felt as though USC was going to embrace all the employees and treat us all the same, which became something that the employees were looking for -— in a sense, to be made whole,” Corea said. “Come to find out, that was not the case, and USC did not have the intention of making everybody whole.”

The family of Eloi Vasquez, a soccer player at UC Berkeley who died last March after a car accident on the 10 Freeway, filed a lawsuit last Wednesday against USC as well as the Tau Kappa Epsilon fraternity for wrongful death and negligence.
Vasquez died in March 2015 at the age of 19 while visiting friends at USC. He was hit by a car as he tried to cross a freeway exit off of the 10 Freeway in Los Angeles on his way to the beach. The accident happened around 2:25 a.m., less than an hour after Vasquez left a party hosted by TKE.
In the lawsuit, Vasquez’s parents accuse the national board of the fraternity, USC and other individuals of knowingly serving Vasquez alcohol despite the fact that he was underage. Additionally, the plaintiffs blamed the fraternity for allowing Vasquez to leave the party by himself even though it was apparent that he was intoxicated.
Vasquez’s parents are hoping to be awarded monetary and punitive damages from Vasquez’s death due to wrongful death and negligence on the part of all of the defendants. Some of the damages that they are seeking include the reimbursements for the funeral and medical treatment as well as compensation for the loss of love, companionship and comfort, according to a report from The Daily Californian.
The national and chapter board of TKE did not respond to requests for comment. The Department of Media Relations also declined to comment, stating that USC does not comment on pending litigation.
Vasquez was a freshman at UC Berkeley and a member of the men’s soccer team, where he played 12 games as a freshman and was known for his hard work as a midfielder. Kevin Grimes, the UC Berkeley’s men’s head coach, lauded Vasquez’s dedication both during and after practice. Vasquez’s mother echoed the praise by saying that though Vasquez was her child, he often gave her advice and supported her, according to The Daily Californian.
As of now, the lawsuit demands a trial by jury by July 27, 2017. It is expected to last 21 days.
The university and the fraternity should be allowed to sue the parents.  They had at least 18 years to raise a son who would not illegally drink.  They are the most negligent.

Two students at the USC Marshall School of Business aren’t waiting until graduation to start their own company. Sophomores Jonathan Lee and Kun Song have launched AutoPreme, a luxury car accessory startup company, and it has already taken off, raising $20,000 in sales in three months.
For most undergraduate students, application of knowledge in the outside world does not begin until after graduation. Starting approximately one year ago during their freshman years, however, Lee and Song began brainstorming and developing a business concept based on their mutual love of cars. Through their research, Lee and Song discovered the grandiosity of the automobile industry: 1.3 million cars are sold per month in the United States alone. AutoPreme was officially launched in November 2015 in efforts to make a mark on the accessory sector of this already booming industry.
“The car accessory business is dominated by a select few companies, who all produce similarly styled accessories,” Lee said in an email to the Daily Trojan. “AutoPreme is here to give consumers a real choice when shopping for car accessories. Our first product is our luxurious floor mats.”
AutoPreme has already made a significant dent in the automobile accessory industry despite having only been out for three months. Within two weeks of the launch, AutoPreme had been selling five to 10 sets of floor mats a day for a variety of car models, with each set priced at $350-399. To date, AutoPreme has accumulated about $20,000 in sales with an advertising model centered around minor social media marketing in addition to accompanying features on several automobile blogs and forums.
One of the company’s current areas of development is the production of different molds for the floor mats. Currently, AutoPreme produces molds for different models of Mercedes Benz, Porsche and Hyundai vehicles. Additionally, in an effort to expand the types of floor mat, consumers are encouraged to send AutoPreme an email with the year, brand and model of their unlisted vehicle to purchase a custom mold.
Moreover, Lee and Song have taken the necessary steps toward garnering the support needed to further the success of their company and have focused their attentions toward raising funds to expand their company.
“Currently, we are in the process of finalizing our crowdfunding campaign and are not taking orders. We will be launching a campaign through KickStarter. Through the funding, we will be able to expand our customizable range, bringing in more molds and colors,” Lee said. “We even auditioned for Shark Tank last week and hope to expand our company through it.”
AutoPreme’s vision does not end there, though. Lee and Song have crafted their mats out of a substance they call PremeLeather, a waterproof, anti-oil, acid and scratch material perfect for the floor of a car.
Additionally, Lee and Song have incorporated an aspect of humanitarianism into their brand, something they are hoping to increase the appeal of AutoPreme as the company expands in the future.
“We are passionate toward the responsibility of saving our environment and natural resources and are proud to announce our sponsorship for the [World Wildlife Fund],” Lee said. “For every AutoPreme floor mat order, we will donate $5 back to the World Wildlife Fund.”

With outlandish dance and swim sequences, far-reaching plot lines and plenty of laughter, Hail, Caesar! marks the return of Ethan and Joel Coen after a three-year hiatus.  The comedy-drama-musical stars Josh Brolin, George Clooney, Scarlett Johansson, Channing Tatum, Jonah Hill and many more stars that only the Coen Brothers and a handful of others could attract. The film relies heavily on laughs and quirky characters, though it is light on story and plot as it explores the life of the original Hollywood fixer.
This movie follows the day to day triumphs and tribulations of Eddie Mannix (Brolin), a character based and named after the first Hollywood fixer who ran Metro-Goldwyn Meyer in the ’50s. Hail, Caesar! tracks Mannix’s life as he deals with everything from celebrity pregnancies, kidnappings, movie budgets, job offers and a crazy set of twin reporters.  Most pressing, however, is the kidnapping of famed movie star Baird Whitlock (masterfully portrayed by Clooney), in the midst of shooting a Roman epic about finding Jesus Christ. Mannix is also forced to deal with the foolish cowboy Hobie Doyle, played by Alden Ehrenreich, and preventing a publicity crisis by finding a husband for the newly pregnant DeAnna Moran (Johansson). While on this journey we meet characters, each one of whom is more absurd than the next, although with each one’s lack of contribution to the story their addition becomes tedious by the ho-hum finale.
Although not specified as a portrayal of the real Mr. Mannix, the film does bare multiple similarities to the real man.  The actual tale of Mr. Mannix is one the original Hollywood fixer — think a 1950s Olivia Pope and in Hollywood instead of Washington, D.C., who worked with stars such as Clark Gable, Joan Crawford and Norma Shearer. His multi-purpose job included monitoring movie budgets, spying on studio heads, and he is said to have read every telegram sent through Western Union traffic, according to E. J. Fleming’s The Fixers: Eddie Mannix, Howard Strickling and the MGM Publicity Machine.
Hail, Caesar! will struggle to find an audience come its early February release, a release date that acknowledges the lack of economic and critical acclaim expected especially after a
last-second move from Christmas, where it would have qualified for the current awards season. While fans of the Coen brothers will undoubtedly show up and enjoy the niche humor and characters, those expecting a 21 Jump Street reunion with Hill and Tatum will be disappointed. Purposefully resembling the films of the mid-20th century, Hail Caesar! often uses humor that only a specific audience can understand and appreciate — communist writers in Hollywood, reminiscent of the Academy Award-nominated film Trumbo, the building of the atomic bomb, as well as a thoroughly amusing discourse between four religious heads about the role of Jesus Christ in their respective religions.
After seeing the film, one is left to wonder if by removing the various celebrity cameos the film would even be successful comedically for laughs are often drawn from the quirkiness and sheer shock of the characters, such as Tatum playing a tap dancing sailor. If one is expecting a film that resembles the trailer in any way shape or form, they will be disappointed, for the kidnapping of Baird Whitlock is only another situation among many that Mr. Mannix is dealing with during the movie. Many scenes throughout the trailer are, in fact, the only scenes the celebrities displayed are in, with Hill, Alison Pill and Frances McDormand in the film for only one scene each.
The film ultimately leaves the viewer unsatisfied, as the use of comedy substituting plot is only enjoyable for so long. The Coens also fail to take the opportunity for a climactic finish and instead focus on small side characters whose overall storylines truly never cross to fulfillment.  While a good time, Hail, Caesar! does not rank well for the Coen Brothers whose works like The Big Lebowski. No Country For Old Men and Fargo have been immortalized in film history. Ultimately, fans of the duo won’t be too disappointed, for the film does deliver countless moments that remind you why the Coen Brothers are so extraordinary.

A few days ago, I was scrolling through my Spotify in an attempt to find a suitable accompaniment for my morning run. During this strenuous search for the perfect soundtrack, I stumbled upon an old favorite of mine: a rare, bootleg 1966 recording of Giacomo Puccini’s La Bohème, starring Franco Corelli and Renata Tebaldi. Smiling, I pressed play.
For as long as I can remember, I’ve always found solace in opera. I believe that opera is one of the great treasures of life, a gem not fully appreciated by a majority of the public. Of all the operas to have had a profound impact on me, it is La Bohème that has shaped my being. And as Valentine’s Day approaches, I find myself once again rediscovering this jewel and listening to it over and over (and over) again.
“It’s that time of year again,” I thought.
I’m not exactly sure when the correlation between La Bohème and Valentine’s Day began, though the association makes sense; La Bohème is essentially a highbrow equivalent of cheesy Hollywood romance. In fact, I consider La Bohème to be more of a guilty pleasure than an operatic masterpiece; it’s not necessarily the most musically complex nor is the storyline innovative or provocative in any sense. Yet, it will always triumph as my favorite opera, and never ceases to make me emotional.
To give a brief synopsis of the plot, La Bohème follows a group of struggling Parisian artists (née bohème) and their unsuccessful attempts to make art and find love. In Act I, the protagonist Rodolfo, a poet, meets Mimì, a seamstress, and after a few arias, a duet and an oh-so-tender embrace, they declare their love for each other. In 2016, one could only describe this phenomenon of “love at first sight” as chimerical: highly unrealistic and wildly fanciful. However, these scenes, which are intended to serve as a heartwarming precursor for an incredibly grim finale, are in fact harder, if not the hardest, for me to watch. Usually, what produces the monsoon-esque sobs from the audience is the Act IV finale (spoiler alert: Mimì dies). For me, however, the waterworks begin much earlier, in Act I, specifically with Rodolfo’s aria “Che gelida manina” (“What a frozen little hand”) and continue all the way through the end of the act. These scenes prove to be the most difficult for me to watch because it gives me anxiety watching two people fall in love and having that love be reciprocal.
Since first being introduced to La Bohème as a child, I’ve lost track of the number of times I’ve seen the show live. Moreover, I couldn’t even begin to tell you how many times I’ve listened to the multitude of audio recordings that have since been released. But this show becomes more difficult to experience as I get older: as a blissfully ignorant teenager, I was drawn to La Bohème not only for the schmaltzy, verismic creaminess of its orchestration, but also because of Rodolfo’s ardor and fervor. But now, as I approach my mid-20’s, I find myself enveloped in a cloud of melancholy with each listen. And perhaps the reason I find it so difficult to see two people falling in love is because it’s something I have yet to experience. Though I’ve been in romantic relationships before, I don’t think I can truly say I’ve been in love within the realm of a rewarding, mutual relationship. So why is it that two people, albeit fictional Parisians, are able to establish monogamy within 20 minutes of meeting each other? I can’t even get the guy I’ve been seeing since last August to fully commit.
Regardless, every year, as Valentine’s Day comes and goes without the serious prospect of a significant other, I think, “Next year will be the year.” Because even though unrequited love has left me feeling empty and foul, I still remain optimistic; I’m certain it’ll happen eventually. And though I continue to listen to La Bohème as what seems to be a form of musical self-mutilation, my arduous quest to find true love remains intact.

It’s been well documented recently in local media that many areas in Los Angeles — especially in South Central — are “food deserts.”  This means these areas have many more fast food restaurants and liquor stores than places to get fresh, healthy food. When fast food is cheaper and more convenient than making the trek to find fresh produce, eating healthy is almost impossible. L.A. food deserts include Inglewood, Compton, Bell and Watts.
That’s where Roy Choi, known for his wildly popular Kogi BBQ Taco Truck, and Daniel Patterson, a well-known San Francisco-based chef, come in. Choi and Patterson just opened a healthy,
reasonably-priced fast food restaurant in Watts, an underserved area, southeast of University Park. LocoL, which opened on Jan. 18, aims to provide nutritious meals for a reasonable price — and succeeds in doing so. The food, which could be described as a fusion of Korean, Mexican and traditional American cuisines, is delicious.
The “foldies,” which is Choi’s version of a soft shell taco, were mouthwatering and, priced at only $2 each, are a good accompaniment to other menu items. The Carnitas foldie was standout; tender pieces of pork, beans and hints of lime wrapped in a warm taco, so good you probably wouldn’t want to share. Other foldies include bean-n-cheese, which is a delicious vegetarian option — not as exciting as the other flavors, but a classic done well. Try the BBQ turkey and machaca (shredded beef with marinade.)
For entrees there are two main options; “burgs” or “bowls.” The burgers are relatively simple but are done well and do not feel heavy or greasy. There are cheeseburgers (both beef and vegetarian) served with scallion relish and “awesome sauce,” a fried chicken burger, which uses minced bits of chicken mixed with a small amount of grain and coleslaw and a BBQ turkey burger served with buttermilk mayo. The buns are light and fluffy, although a little smaller than one would normally expect.
While the “Noodleman” bowl is a good option for vegetarians (though, there are a multitude of vegetarian options at LocoL) it does not have as much flavor as other menu items. Soft noodles with cabbage, carrot and a warm broth is a nice concept and  apparently is the most popular bowl on the menu. For $6, it is good, but there are menu items that are a little less bland. The “Messy Beef Chili Bowl” packs more of a flavor punch and is Choi’s favorite item on the menu.
The soft serve sundaes are delicious. Soft vanilla ice cream with mashed bananas, a passionfruit and pineapple sauce and granola for crunch. It is not overwhelmingly sweet and the tanginess of the sauce works well with the mellow creaminess of the banana. Coffee (hot or cold, black or sweet and creamy) and agua frescas are both $1. Tying in with the healthy motive, there are no sodas for sale.
Although the breakfast menu does not start for another two weeks, with different flavored “egg in the hole,” “French toast holes” and “Yogurt and Granola.” Judging by how successful the lunch and dinner menus are, it surely won’t disappoint.
Choi acts as more than just the creator; he is often at the store greeting customers and overseeing operations. For him and co-founder Patterson, LocoL is more than just a restaurant. They aim to empower through food and change the mindset that good food has to be unhealthy. The restaurant might be “for-profit”, but the profit margins are low enough to keep prices reasonable. It is staffed by locals and is for locals, although there are many from further afield that were drawn in by Choi and Patterson’s reputations.
The seating is all lounge style, and instead of glass there are screen windows. The open kitchen coupled with cartoon style wall decoration makes for a relaxed ambience that immediately hits you upon entering.
For USC students looking for a fast but healthy option in South Central, head to the intersection of Anzac Avenue and 103rd Street.

Following the death of 19-year-old UC Berkeley student Eloi Vasquez, who was killed last March while trying to cross the 10 freeway after attending a Tau Kappa Epsilon party on the Row, a lawsuit was filed against USC and TKE’s executive board. The Vasquez family is asserting that both the University and TKE were responsible for allowing their son into the party and serving him alcohol despite being underage. They further argue that the frat and its party organizers failed to take care of Vasquez after it was clear he was too drunk to care of himself. This lawsuit points to a larger conversation about who is at fault for minors’ alcohol consumption at frat parties.
The University must address the dangerous and sometimes even deadly consequences of failing to enforce its own rules with regard to underage drinking at university-sanctioned parties — policies that only stand to further endanger students if they are not meaningfully enforced.
This isn’t the first time a visiting student has been put in danger on university grounds. In 2013, the University and fraternity Sigma Alpha Epsilon — which has since been disbanded — came under fire following an incident in which a female student from LMU was critically injured after falling off a table at a party. This coincided with an increase in hospital transports due to alcohol consumption, prompting the University to issue sanctions on the Row — one of which included requiring students to show USC identification in order to attend registered events.
Though the extra security precautions were established in an effort to promote a safer social atmosphere, such attempts are futile if they are made in name only. The fact of the matter is that student IDs are rarely checked at parties and the University would have no way of knowing if they were in the first place. By establishing policies that simply can’t be enforced, the University cannot expect meaningful change — and neither can students.
USC has attempted to implement proactive changes to the University’s drinking culture, such as mandating that students enroll in online AlcoholEdu training. But such initiatives need to be supported by meaningful University action. Promoting personal responsibility is fundamentally important, but such efforts can only go so far if the University fails to enforce its own policies with regard to safety.
We’ve all heard the tired arguments that parties will happen regardless of the rules put in place, be it on the Row or elsewhere — that students can’t be stopped from underage drinking and attempts at limiting it is futile. And though there is certainly truth to these arguments, it doesn’t make underage drinking any less illegal or any less dangerous. Simply dismissing this reality as the norm or citing how long we’ve gotten away with such risky behavior without consequence isn’t an argument that will hold up in court — and it shouldn’t.
Yes, parties will continue to be thrown. And yes, underage college students will continue to drink. But USC needn’t enable the process. If the University has any hope of providing a safe social environment at university-sanctioned parties for both its students and the guests who attend, then it has both a moral and legal obligation to enforce its own policies and ensure that what happened to Eloi Vasquez doesn’t happen again.

After attending a party at USC’s Tau Kappa Epsilon fraternity, UC Berkeley soccer player Eloi Vasquez tried to run across the Interstate 10 freeway and was subsequently killed in the early morning hours of March 28, 2015. Vasquez’s parents are now suing the national student executive board of TKE for serving their son alcohol although he was under 21 and even after, they claim, it seemed evident that Vasquez was unable to take care of himself. While it is understandable that Vasquez’s parents would want to alleviate their grief with some sort of blame, their lawsuit is misguided, should be and will be immediately thrown out of court.
The implication of this reasoning is that every greek party should card attendees and not serve to those who are underage. This would only be fair if every party affiliated with USC did the same. Not only is this unfeasible, but it also discounts the importance of personal responsibility. The fact is that kids in college will always find a way to drink alcohol, and the University’s efforts would be far more wisely exerted by teaching students how to drink responsibly as opposed to sanctioning student groups in a misguided effort to prevent underage students from drinking at all.
An apt metaphor for this situation would be abstinence-only education. Yes, completely abstaining from sexual activities is the only way to guarantee pregnancy and STD prevention, but it is unrealistic to expect every student to follow suit. Similarly, we can pretend that if frat parties carded, then underage students would not get access to alcohol. However, the fact is that the overwhelming majority of USC parties serve alcohol indiscriminately, and even if they did not, students would still find a way to get a fake ID, as many already have.
The obligation of a fraternity is to provide a party experience free from force, as it relates to sex as well as alcohol consumption. If the case of Vasquez involved him being involuntarily urged to consume alcohol by members of the fraternity, then of course TKE would be to blame. However, accounts of Vasquez’s tenure at the party in question did not allude to any sort of aggression, either by the members of TKE nor by other partygoers. Still, the onus is on the individual to moderate one’s own behavior and not force his or her own behavior onto others.
While I feel nothing but the greatest sympathy for the parents of Vasquez, the fact remains that a possible lawsuit against TKE is a fallacious blame game and would not prevent such tragedies in the future. While many of us may complain that USC’s mandatory AlcoholEdu takes a long time, it is an absolute necessity to ensure that Trojans are armed with the knowledge to make smart choices without sacrificing a good time. However, considering that UC Berkeley also uses the AlcoholEdu program, perhaps Vasquez’s parents could do more justice to the memory of their son by investing in the cause of alcohol education. It would be unwise to force the social extinction of the greek system, as its regulation in recent years has made fraternities increasingly safer and its extinction could lead to the prevalence of less regulated parties. Instead, we ought to focus on empowering fellow students to make the right choices, both on campus and as we embark on adulthood.

Tim, forgive me if I seem a cynic, but you missed the boat. Several underlying actions are operating here. First, The parents are devastated and angry and seek to blame someone other than an irresponsible, inebriated son who was crossing the Santa Monica Fwy. at 0225 in the morning. Second, they sought a lawyer to “punish” the university and TKE, whom they blame for their son’s sad and premature death. Or maybe a tort lawyer quickly sought them out to get a fat payday, but in any case the parents and their lawyer will likely win their case. Juries are naturally sympathetic to a family who has lost a child whose adult life and college years were just beginning. Could this accident have been avoided by reasonable action from USC or TKE? I don’t think so. Sorry, but a 19-year-old student at UC Berkeley should be held accountable for his private acts, devastated parents or not.

It’s 10 minutes into a Friday night practice and Jeff Sacha is already sweating. He squats, hands behind his head, and demonstrates how to execute a “duck walk” up a small ramp.
Behind him, a scattered group of 20 kids watch, outlined by the lights of the Pico-Union Boxing Gym. The makeshift gym is tucked in the back corner of the Pico-Union Housing parking lot, smeared with graffiti, enclosed by concrete and barbed wire fences. It’s easily missed, a single slim doorway spilling light into the dark lot.
This is Sacha’s home. For five years, he’s taught boxing lessons here to local kids for free. As part of a partnership with the USC Boxing Club, Sacha, who is pursuing a doctoral degree in sociology, spends six hours a week training more than 50 local kids.
He knows every kid by first name, bumping fists with them as they straggle into practice, asking about their math tests and their parents. Five years ago, he built this gym with his own hands, laying the floor, tearing down walls, hanging mismatched punching bags. When he was married, he signed up for a $600 registry for boxing equipment rather than silver and crystal. For his five years at USC, this has been the most important thing in his life.
But in a few short months, he’ll leave it behind to become a professor at UC Davis. Sacha is unsure what this means for the club, for his athletes — and that scares him. Without their primary coach and without any funding, the Pico-Union club is at an uncertain turning point.
“It’s hard to think about leaving this behind,” Sacha says. “Near impossible, really. I don’t want to go. If I could stay here, right now, training these kids — I would do it.”
Before wrapping his hands and putting on gloves, Sacha goes through the basic technique of a new combination with one of his older athletes. Photo by Joseph Chen.
The gym started as an experiment, when the USC Boxing Club didn’t have a gym. The Pico-Union Housing Company offered to provide the club with three abandoned garages, along with $1,500 in support. The organization provides Section 8 public housing to more than 300 residents in the Pico-Union neighborhood, one of the highest-crime neighborhoods in Central Los Angeles according to the Los Angeles Times. PUHC asked that in exchange for free rent, the club open the gym to the neighborhood.
At the beginning, turnout was minimal — a handful of kids, maybe 14 or 15 a week. Now, Sacha can count on 20 to 30 athletes each day. Those athletes have become family to him, and he doesn’t want to leave.
But Sacha doesn’t have that choice. Instead, he focuses on this moment, coaching an athlete’s mother on how to properly squat, showing her how to keep her weight over her toes.
Maria Macedonio, 28, has been boxing alongside her nine-year-old daughter for the past week. It’s been over a year since she worked out, and Sacha’s intensive core workouts leave her out of breath and exhausted. Next week, she’ll go on the group four-mile run. Today, she shakes out her legs and smiles as her daughter takes off at the front of the group.
Sacha has a strict rule for the gym — no boxers under 12 years old. But he broke that rule for Macedonio’s daughter, a talented young athlete who he works in the ring after her run. He holds up foam punching sticks and tells her to give ten quick jabs.
The stance is natural on her small frame as she hoists her bright pink Everlast gloves. Every punch connects with a satisfying thump. She shyly looks up at Sacha, a smile curling the corners of her lips.
“It builds up her little nine-year-old self esteem,” Macedonio said. “She’s very self conscious about her height, so seeing that she can come in here and do everything right alongside the big kids, I think that’s very good for her. And whatever is good for her, or makes her happy, that’s what I want to do, too.”
Increasing confidence is one of Sacha’s greatest focuses in training his athletes. Only one day of Sacha’s week is spent sparring with his athletes; the rest of the gym’s schedule consists of running, strength exercises and technique training. Before coming to the gym, physical fitness had not been a part of most of these kids’ lives. They don’t know how to do a push-up or a squat. Their P.E. classes in school consist of walking around a track. For safety reasons, girls are encouraged to stay inside after dark.
This means that many athletes come to Sacha overweight and uncoordinated. But in the first few weeks of training, they’ll drop weight visibly. A key part of Sacha’s boxing workouts involves jumping rope, running and strength training. In weeks, his beginner athletes will improve from being unable to run for half a mile to keeping up with older athletes on three- or four-mile runs. This type of improvement is one of the most rewarding parts of Sacha’s role as a coach.
“You see kids come in and they’ve never worked out in their lives,” Sacha said. “They have no idea how to do it. We don’t just teach them how to box, we teach them how to take care of themselves, how to train to stay healthy and improve their lives as a whole.”
Most of the athletes at the gym are beginners when they come to the gym. That wasn’t the case for Adrian Cruz, 21, who had been fighting for years before coming to Pico-Union. He sits on one of the benches against the wall, hunched as he carefully wraps his right hand.
The white fabric is unraveled on the floor, resting at the feet of Sacha’s wife, Caitlin. She’s grinning at him, lightly shoving his shoulder. They’re recalling Cruz’s fight back in November. It’s two months later, and they’re still recalling that fight.
Cruz is the star of the club. When the gym hosts its first home fight on May 29, he’ll be the headliner, the center of attention. But that meant nothing to his competition at the Rivals in the Ring fight at the Los Angeles Athletic Club last November. Walking into the fight, he was expected to be an easy target — a “walk in the park,” in the words of his Berkeley competitor. The only people in the room who believed in him were Sacha and Ramon Espada, head coach of the USC Boxing Club.
The fight went three rounds, and the superior fighter was never the question — Cruz won by unanimous decision. As he lifted his gloves, he grinned.
“Nobody in there thought anything of me,” Cruz said. “I proved them all wrong. That’s why I love it. Boxing is the one thing in my life that I haven’t given up on and that hasn’t given up on me. I come in here and feel like I’m good at something, like I’m important.”
That feeling of importance is something that Cruz, along with other boxers, attribute to the personal attention Sacha gives every single one of his athletes. In the ring, Stephanie Varela is next up to take her turn training one-on-one with Sacha. She throws a right hook and he taps her left elbow.
“Watch that elbow.” He taps it again. “Act like you’re pinning a tennis ball under there. It’ll keep your arms more clean.”

It’s been two years since the 17-year-old first started coming to the gym. At the time, she wanted a new way to train. She’d been an LAPD cadet since she was 12, and she’d known that she wanted to be a cop even longer than that. Boxing was a different outlet to train for that future, and the Pico-Union gym was close by and completely affordable.
It was different than she expected. As a cadet, her training was supervised, driven by having commands yelled at her constantly. At the gym, she set her own pace. If she wanted to push it, she had to find that drive within.
“It’s hard at first, training yourself to really push yourself and put in that extra effort,” Varela said. “I didn’t know how to do that at first, but I’ve learned to push myself and get just as much out of it as when I have someone on my back.”
Varela is a senior in high school now. She’s been accepted to one college already, and she’s toured several more in the Bay Area. Going to school will mean leaving behind the gym and the bonds she’s made there, but she knows she will take the discipline of boxing with her wherever she goes.
What Sacha loves about this space is that it takes an action that is seen as destructive in the outside world and transforms it into a positive influence. Before coming to the gym, the only experience his athletes have with throwing punches are fights at school and domestic abuse at home.
In this gym, fighting means discipline. Many of the athletes are scared or angry or just overwhelmed when they get hit for the first time. They have to learn to use those emotions, to harness them into something more effective. To Espada, this is why boxing goes far beyond its violent stereotype.
“A great boxing match is like a great game of chess,” Espada said. “You have to think, you have to act with your head. Boxing isn’t about going into a ring and just punching the other guy out. You win with discipline. You win with your head.”
The coaches have seen discipline carry over to every aspect of athletes’ lives. Their athletes perform better in school; they are accepted into community colleges; they find time to balance school and jobs. This is the ultimate goal of the club — to make its athletes better people. And it is part of Sacha’s ultimate goal to see one of his athletes become a USC student.
That hasn’t happened yet. But it’s a goal that Sacha believes isn’t far away. He’s seen athletes progress from high school dropouts to college students, and that gives him hope for the future of their education. His dedication in the ring translates into athletes’ success in the rest of the world.
Sacha holds the padded sticks upright in both hands. A high school sophomore named Eric circles him. Eric slams two jabs, then ducks beneath the stick that is swung at his head. As he straightens he throws a left hook, then follows it up with two more jabs.
“Good!” Sacha grins, and Eric grins back, flashing the green and red of his Mexican flag mouthguard.
Compact and wiry, Eric is one of Sacha’s most promising Pico-Union boxers. He took martial arts classes for several years growing up before it became too expensive for his family. When his mother, who teaches Zumba classes across the street, stumbled upon a free boxing gym, she leapt at the opportunity to get Eric back into fighting. Two years later, he’s almost ready for his first fight.
Sacha tells the boys to start sparring and trades the sticks for gloves. He hops in with them, barraging each boy with light jabs, laughing as they swing back, pointing out when they need to tuck in their elbows and pull their shoulders back. The final bell rings, signaling the end of practice.
“Hey, touch gloves, touch gloves,” Sacha shouts, and the boys tap gloves before clambering out of the ring. It’s a matter of respect — at the end of the day, Sacha wants his boxers to see each other as family, not enemies.
“I miss my days of competing,” Sacha sighs, leaning heavily against the ropes. He was 6-3 in college amateur fights, the first USC boxer to qualify for the national championship. He laughs, wiping sweat from his forehead with his forearm. “Now I’m married and boring.”
He watches his boys as they split off, some doing extra pushups, others putting in reps on the bags. Some of these kids, he says, will stay for almost an hour after practice, putting in 100 push-ups at a time, holding bags for each other to practice a new combination.
Sacha didn’t teach them that, he says. He didn’t teach them how to be so brave, so persistent. When he leaves, they will still have all this — the same space, the same hours, the same dedication.
What they won’t have is a coach. Espada comes from six to eight to train the USC fighters, but he doesn’t have time to work the Pico-Union boxers. There are plenty of boxers in the club who have the skill level to coach, but they don’t have the time or the freedom to volunteer for six hours each week. Sacha has even thought about asking one of the older boys to lead lessons in his absence. None of it feels right. None of it feels good enough.
And if finding a coach wasn’t hard enough, the influx of new boxers means that Sacha and Espada need money — more than the $1,500 from five years ago, which was used up long ago in the expenses of boxing equipment. With less than four months left in Los Angeles, these concerns are rising for Sacha and his club.
The club has always found a way to survive, even a way to thrive. But with Sacha leaving, the future of the Pico-Union gym is still an unanswered question.
“This means so much to me, so much more than any of these kids know,” Sacha says. “But at the end of the day, I’m just not sure where it’s going to go. At the end of the day, I’m just not sure at all.”
 
It’s a Wednesday night in Pico-Union. The rest of the boxers have left for a run, leaving Jason Garcia, 21, alone in the dimly lit gym. He circles a bag, lightly swatting at it with his left hand before throwing a jab with his right. The hood of his black jacket is up. An earbud blasts music in his right ear. The other is tucked inside his jacket. He dances, jabs, shuffles, jabs again.
In the day, Garcia attends classes at El Camino College and studies at home. At night, he makes the 12-mile train ride from Compton to the Pico-Union to train at the gym. Between the two, there isn’t much time for slacking.
He was 19 when his friend Chucky brought him here for the first time. After a few practices, Garcia was hooked. Now, he rides that train to Pico-Union and back three times a week with the other boys from Compton. Today, however, he’s alone.
“They bailed on me,” he laughs. “Too tired out from Monday.”
Garcia can name a laundry list of buzzwords that the gym has taught him. The word that comes first is commitment. Commitment of his time, of those extra hours he spends on the train every week, cheek pressed to the dark window. Most importantly, commitment to his gym. Garcia tries not to miss a single practice. He learned from Sacha early on that the gym was not a place that would take attendance, but it was a place that required dedication in order to succeed.
“Jeff won’t even hand you handwraps until you’ve been coming to a few weeks of practice without missing any,” Garcia says. “When he handed [them] to me, it was like he was saying that he trusted me, he was investing in me. So now I have to do the same, give that same trust to the gym every day I come out here.”
He speaks of Sacha as a mentor, as a leader. This man taught him to train, to fight, to keep his elbows in tight and keep his head pulled back from an opponent’s swing. This man taught him discipline. When he speaks of Sacha, he speaks with respect in his voice.
But his success comes from somewhere different. Not from another man telling him what to do but from the voice in his own head that demands he comes early and stays late. Not from any outside motivation, but from a singular drive that Sacha helped him unearth. Sacha didn’t give him his discipline, or his commitment, Garcia says. He helped him find it.
Garcia knows what he wants out of life. He’s going to compete in a few fights. He’s going to become an electrical engineer. And eventually, he’ll open his own gym, closer to home in Compton. Whether or not Sacha is here, he says, he’ll find a way to make it happen. The people here always do.
For now, he focuses on the bag in front of him. He takes a few hits, dances backwards, then lunges forward for another hit.
For now, this is enough.

I let my anxiety get the best of me this fall semester and chose to defer until spring. My anxiety (which takes the form of nausea) feels like it’s taking over my life; when I was at school, I tried to attend classes, and found 10 minutes into class I couldn’t handle it and left. I’m not sure what to do and I’m so scared the same thing will happen in the spring. What should I do?
Anxiety is a very common issue at college campuses — According to a 2012 National Alliance on Mental Health survey, more than one in 10 college students suffer from anxiety.
If you have not sought counseling, now is a great time to start. It’s no secret that Engemann counselors are a bit busy at best; at worst, grossly understaffed, evidenced by a counselor to student ratio of one to 1,700 in 2014. (However, I should say that USC announced plans for a six counselor increase last semester.) If you are unable to receive prompt and adequate care at USC, Engemann counseling services will help you find a healthcare provider who specializes in treating anxiety. Therapy can help you develop the skills to manage your nausea attacks. 
Because I’m obviously unfit to give medical advice, the best I can do is to give you the spiel I give my own friends. Your mind needs to be taken care of just like your body, and your health should come before all other responsibilities. You might have anxiety your whole life, but once you learn how to cope with it, you’ll get control back.

Caitlin Tran | Daily Trojan
This past year, I’ve been lucky to have had the opportunity to travel with friends all around the world. I’ve watched the sunset on the Champ de Mars in Paris, celebrated Independence Day at Dolores Park in San Francisco and played ping pong with Berliners at an underground club in Germany. All these experiences and more have not only opened my eyes to the world and put some wear on my passport but also awakened a yearn in me for a solo adventure. When a cheap round-trip fare to a city I’ve always dreamed of visiting appeared in my inbox, I found myself gently breaking the news to my parents that I wouldn’t be coming home for spring break. Instead, I told them I’d be traveling across the pond to London, alone. And of course, I wouldn’t be going completely alone. Below are my favorite tried and trusty apps that will be accompanying me.
Caitlin Tran | Daily Trojan
Citymapper
I first tried this transit app when I was in Europe and have been hooked ever since. Citymapper gives the best real-time public transportation directions and provides information on alternatives like the price of an Uber, how many calories you’ll burn if you walk or an estimate for the time of a hypothetical jetpack ride. Its latest update even tells you information on the best section to sit on in the subway to be positioned for a quick station exit or line transfer. Citymapper is currently available in 29 major cities, including Los Angeles, with more constantly being added.
Caitlin Tran | Daily Trojan
WhatsApp
More than 800 million people use WhatsApp around the world to send texts and calls over the Internet. The last time I was in Europe, instead of racking up expensive roaming charges, I simply connected to wifi and communicated with my friends and family for free over WhatsApp. Facebook acquired this messaging app for about $22 billion in 2014 and has helped it grow to become the second-most popular app on Earth.

Airbnb
London is a notoriously expensive city to visit, but cheap crowded hostels aren’t my scene. Instead of ponying up for a hotel room, I booked the more affordable guest room of a beautiful town house on Airbnb. I’ve rented both entire apartments and guest rooms through the company, and I actually prefer staying with locals. It’s a unique and appreciated experience to come home to friendly faces at the end of a long day of exploring. The mobile app has all the same functionality as the website and is convenient to use when you’d like to shoot potential hosts a quick message about their listing or communicate with hosts you’ve booked with.

CityMaps2Go
The moment I decide on a trip, CityMaps2Go becomes my best friend for planning my itinerary. After downloading a map, you can bookmark locations to it, add notes and see where all the places you’re interested in are in relation to each other. I like to customize my pins with the different color and shape options so I can easily differentiate restaurants, accommodations and attractions from above and, unlike most other map apps, CityMaps2Go uses GPS so no internet is required once you’ve initially downloaded the map.
