The university is offering a $125,000 reward for any information leading to the arrest and conviction of a suspect or suspects in the murder of two USC students, according to a Los Angeles Police Department statement.
Graduate students Ming Qu and Ying Wu were fatally shot early Wednesday morning while sitting in Qu’s car near the intersection of Raymond Avenue and 27th Street.

Detectives found no signs of a robbery, struggle or altercation at the scene where Qu and Wu, both 23 years old, were shot and killed, said LAPD Homicide Detective Supervisor Sal LaBarbera.
The gunman approached the driver’s side of the vehicle, where Qu sat, and fired multiple shots from five to six feet away, LaBarbera said. The shots shattered the driver’s side window.
Detectives said the gunman fled south on Raymond Avenue.
LaBarbera said Qu got out of the vehicle to seek help after he and Wu were shot. Officers found Qu collapsed on the front porch of Wu’s residence on the 2700 block of Raymond Avenue. Wu was found in the front passenger seat of the vehicle. The car was double-parked with its hazard lights flashing.
Qu and Wu were transported to the California Hospital Medical Center shortly after 1 a.m., where they were pronounced dead.
Detectives said no DNA from the suspect was obtained at the scene. Rain was pouring down at the time of the shooting and might have washed away possible evidence.
LaBarbera said it was normal for Qu to visit Wu at her residence.
“That was routine for them,” LaBarbera said. “He would normally bike over and meet her, but in this case he drove because of the rain.”
Both victims were second-year graduate students studying electrical engineering at the Viterbi School of Engineering.
Investigators do not have a motive, but they believe the suspected male shooter acted alone. No further description of a suspect has been released.
Surveillance footage from nearby businesses on Normandie Avenue and footage obtained from DPS surveillance and license plate recognition cameras in the area are being reviewed. There are no cameras installed directly on Raymond Avenue.
LaBarbera said gang members live in the neighborhoods north and south of the block where the shooting occurred, but the block where Wu lived is home to mostly families and students.
“This is definitely an isolated incident,” LaBarbera said.
Detectives have not determined a motive or whether the shooting was gang-related.
“We do have some good leads that we’re working on,” LaBarbera said. “We have over a dozen homicide detectives working on the case.”
Members of the FBI, DPS Officers and LAPD Officers from the Southwest Division are also assisting with the investigation.
Administrators at USC pledged to fully cooperate with the investigation and will offer support to the victims’ families, friends and anyone affected by the murders.
“We want to make sure they get connected to the right support,” said Lynette Merriman, senior associate dean of students.
Dean of Religious Life Varun Soni said the university is working toward holding an on-campus memorial service, preferably with the parents of the victims present.
“We’re very respectful to what the students’ families would want,” Soni said.
As the dean of religious life, Soni is tasked with overseeing ceremonial and religious events, such as the candlelight vigil held for Qu and Wu Wednesday evening.
Denzil Suite, associate vice president for student affairs, said the Chinese Consulate-General in Los Angeles is working with the university to help communicate with Wu and Qu’s parents, should they wish travel to Los Angeles.
“[The Chinese Consulate-General] visited campus [Wednesday],” Suite said. “We’re having a discussion of how we can coordinate with the family.”
Qu’s parents live in the Jilin province of China. Wu’s parents reside in the Hunan province. University officials could not give a timetable as to when the parents might obtain visas to travel to the United States.
A press conference on details of the investigation and the monetary reward is scheduled for Friday at 1 p.m. at the Raymond Avenue crime scene.
Detectives encouraged anyone with information to call the LAPD’s Criminal Gang Homicide Division at (213) 485-4341 or the Detective Information Desk at the 24-hour toll-free number 877-LAPD-24-7.
“Anything would help us,” LaBarbera said. “We’re very hopeful that we’ll be able to solve this case.”
People are assuming this is gang-related, when perhaps it could be a case of a jealous ex-boyfriend. 
God rest their souls and bring the person(s) responsible for this atrocity to justice.
A “jealous ex-boyfriend”? These were international students. No one thinks this is anything other than a thug local demonstrating exactly why USC needs to work harder to push locals out of the neighborhood, for the sake of student safety.
“Detectives found no signs of a robbery, struggle or altercation at the scene…”
Four years ago when my student registerd at USC I was told USC and LAPD had a secure area within a Two mile radius of the campus. Also recall an SC parent mailing that millions were allocated to more security cameras in the north campus area. I gather now this was simply the wrong block! Tragic!
As a recent Trojan alum, i am deeply saddened by this news. My sincere and heartfelt condolences to their families. This is such a tragedy. I applaud USC for the reward for information as I hope that leads to the capture of who ever is responsible for this deed. Many student’s don’t realize it, but USC takes safety and security of its students very strictly and seriously. I am looking forward to the capture of whoever is responsible for this sin and act of cowardliness. We will Fight On even in this time when our patience is tested. RIP
This is the time to dismantle and take apart dangerous gangs that are bringing so much terror and grief to the city. I live in a high security building with great city and ocean views 2 blocks west of downtown on wilshire and if the LAPD would do more I would do much more in the  community. Mac Arthur Park at the north end of Hover is one of the most beautiful urban parks anywhere. It is time that we take our city back from criminals and drunks defecating and urinating all over the place.
Very disturbing. Could the killings have been some sick gang initiation? The thought that Qu and Wu were randomly targeted is sickening.
Detective Labrera’s matter-of-fact stipulation that “gang members live in the neighborhoods north and south of the block where the shooting occurred” tells the story of life in Los Angeles.   We have a city, county, and state governance that simply shrugs.
Ironically, as the press disclaims USC’s responsibility for this tragedy, they note that Raymond is “outside the USC Security Zone”, neglecting to mention that “Community Activists” have, for years, fought USC’s attempts to improve the neighborhood, resulting in the University agreeing NOT to do anything west of Vermont.

Despite safety concerns among students and parents after the shooting Wednesday morning of two USC graduate students from China, administrators, students and law enforcement officials said the area near the shooting is relatively safe. All parties, however, urged students to be aware of their surroundings, especially late at night.
Ying Wu and Ming Qu, graduate students studying electrical engineering, were fatally shot around 1 a.m. The shooting took place near the intersection of Raymond Avenue and 27th Street, about three blocks west of Vermont Avenue.
Safety concerns · The Los Angeles Police Department says crime near the scene of the shooting has decreased over the last few years. - Chloe Stepney | Daily Trojan
Sal LaBarbera, a Los Angeles Police Department homicide detective supervisor assigned to the case, said the particular incident was an aberration in an area where crime has been decreasing.
“Crime has been on a steady decrease in the past few years,” LaBarbera said. “The shooting was definitely an isolated incident.”
LaBarbera also said the circumstances — heavy rain, the late hour of night and the hazard lights of their car — made the victims an easy target for anyone looking for trouble.
Dept. of Public Safety Capt. David Carlisle said the neighborhood is safe, based on the small number of crimes reported to DPS. Though the department receives calls related to theft, Carlisle said no violent crime has been reported in that area this year.
“This particular crime occurred in an area that doesn’t have a history of violent crime.” he said. “The majority of crimes reported to DPS, which would be from USC-related people, are thefts. We’ve had two stolen cars this year but no violent crime.”
As USC has moved from a commuter school to a predominately residential school, more students have moved to off-campus housing, including  the area west of Vermont Avenue. Carlisle said with that change DPS has devoted more resources to the area west of Vermont Avenue between Exposition Boulevard and Jefferson Avenue.
“We’ve increased our public safety resources in the neighborhoods where the student population used to be lower,” Carlisle said.
DPS, however, does not officially patrol the area where the shooting occurred. Carlisle said DPS does have a few cameras in the community and it is not unusual for officers to be in the neighborhood.
USC will consult with LAPD before making any changes to its patrol boundaries, Carlisle said.
“A decision to expand our patrol boundaries would be made by senior administrators working with [DPS] Chief [Carey] Drayton,” Carlisle said. “Quite frankly, although this is a terrible single crime, it is one crime where we’ve had no other violent crimes reported in that area this year.”
Josh Durica, a junior majoring in computer science who lives in a DPS-patrolled neighborhood about a seven-minute walk away from the shooting, said he generally feels safe living west of Vermont.
“Where I live I feel pretty safe with the CSC guards and everything,” Durica said. “I walk home at least once a week at 3 a.m. by myself, and I never fear for my safety.”
Still, Durica said more can be done in light of the shooting.
“If a double homicide is happening near our campus, there are more steps that can be taken,” Durica said.
Though crime is decreasing in the area where the shooting took place, LaBarbera said the campus still remains the safest location with the most security.
Carlisle said the incident highlights the need for students to take notice when walking off campus.
“Be aware of your surroundings,” Carlisle said. “Try and follow all of the safety tips we normally talk about.”
These tips include traveling in large groups, not flaunting valuables and taking university-sponsored transportation, such as Campus Cruiser.
Mark Green, an LAPD sergeant for community relations, echoed Carlisle’s caution, saying students should always remain aware of their surroundings regardless of their location.
“People should be aware of safety issues no matter where they are,” Green said. “They should be cognizant of the areas and just know that they’re in a large metropolitan city and can be victimized.”

hmm, my first comment got deleted. but i said something along the lines of
why is this article understating the dangers of USC area? while USC area may not be worse than other parts of downtown LA, downtown LA is a lot worse than wealthier suburban area where many of the students are from.
USC area is the most dangerous area I have ever lived in, and I am sure most of students would agree with me.
there has been 4 homicides just last year within a 1 mile radius of 2700 raymond ave. and 22 in the past 5 years.
http://projects.latimes.com/homicide/search/?address=2700%20Raymond%20Ave,%20Los%20Angeles,%20CA%2090007,%20USA&lat=34.0309102&lng=-118.2980541&g=Geocodify
I currently live 10 miles from university park campus, in a midle-middle class, predominantly asian community. there has only been 1 homicide last year and 5 in the past 5 years. and i even got my car stolen just last year. i definitely do not feel safe in my neighbourhood but it is a haven compared to USC area.
so even though there has “only” been 4 homicides, there’s a lot more theft and robberies occuring around USC. not to mention, it seems like over half of them involve a weapon such as a handgun or knife. even if no one was hurt, i would be pretty darn scared if someone tried to rob me by pointing a handgun or knife at me. the area is NOT safe.
Was it Mark Twain who once said there are three kinds of lies: lies, damned lies, and statistics?  Notice how people often refer to south central LA as being a “relatively safe” area.  Relative to what?  Mogadishu, Baghdad, or Ciudad Juarez?  They also quote crime statistics.  Violent crime is going down, blah, blah, blah, etc., etc…  So is it safe to roam the streets surrounding USC?  That’s the $64,000 question.
People in their late teens and early twenties have a sense of invincibility that bad things only happen to other people.  Statistically speaking, the vast majority of crimes against students are crimes of opportunity.  They are soft, easy targets, especially those who wander around drunk at 2 o’clock in the morning after another party night.  Yes, every once and a while a student will get killed by a bullet or run over by a hit & run driver.  Statistically, it’s not a major “problem” unless, of course, you are the victim or the family and friends of the victim.  
So what’s a student to do once they are free from the watchful eyes of their parents?  There is no amount of public safety officers, police officers, or cameras in the community that will prevent criminals from preying on students.  Bottom line, it’s really up to the student to use that intelligent brain of theirs to avoid becoming the next statistic.  Stay safe.
I took flowers for the victims yesterday, I saw many students walking to class. USC and the LAPD must provide security. There are many beautiful homes there. Camera technology could help them patrol every corner of the USC comunity.
current student,
Call me a scaredy cat but 2 murders, 5 robberies, and 1 sexual battery in 4 months sounds pretty frightening to me!!
scaredycat
and clearly, students are NOT taking enough precautions if i am still receiving crime alerts about MULTIPLE students getting robbed on a weekly basis!
so yes, it is a dangerous area. even though there were “only” 4 homicides last year, there are plenty of robberies and theft going around to make the area VERY unsafe.
Good lord, what is with people exaggerating the crime reports issue??? I don’t think we are getting the same crime alerts…there are a handful of messages a month, half of which are usually “Incident Resolution” messages, not notifications of new crimes. And we sure as hell are not getting “multiple alerts every week.”
In fact, I just went back through my e-mails now. There were crime alerts sent out on the following dates this semester:
-April 10, robbery
-March 19, robbery
-Feb 29, robbery
-Feb 26, robbery **this incident was later found to be completely fabricated by the “victim”
-Feb 5, robbery
-Jan 30, sexual battery
-Jan 12, robbery
The other 7 e-mails they sent were all Incident Resolution reports.
So what were you saying about “multiple robberies every single week”?
Dear Current Student, 
Just a friendly advice – 
Do NOT become a lawyer!
The current student wasn’t saying the area is perfectly safe or that there is no crime. They were simply wanting people to use *facts* when talking about the issue, as opposed to wildly inaccurate statements, like claiming we get “multiple alerts about robberies every week.”
USC is in the middle of Los Angeles. Obviously there are going to be concerns about crime and safety. But comparisons of the area around USC to “the jungle,” “Mogadishu,” “The Wild West,” “a war zone,” “Baghdad,” “Ciudad Juarez,” or “a shooting range,” are disingenuous at best.
Also, side note about the “robberies”….If I remember correctly, half of them weren’t “robberies,” really…they were literally people having their lunch stolen from them while walking home. Pretty sure I face worse at my suburban middle school…
Your Honor: My client, the defendant, is really not a bad person! He only commits robbery on average once a month, not once a week as the prosecutor would like you to believe! :)
What is disingenuous is USC stating to prospective applicants and their parents that crime is not common in the area when they regularly send out crime alerts to current students!
i’m not really sure if this is beneficial, to understate the danger of the area. if someone came from a city with little to no violent crimes in the past few years, this area is going to be viewed as dangerous. USC area is the worst area i have ever lived in, in my entire life. and why even stop at violent crimes? aren’t robberies and theft bad enough?
with 4 homicides JUST last year, and 22 in the past 5 years within a ONE MILE radius of 2700 raymond, i’m not sure you can say the area is safe.
http://projects.latimes.com/homicide/search/?lat=34.030912&lng=-118.298108&d=1&g=Geocoder.ca&address=2700+Raymond+Ave%2C+Los+Angeles%2C+CA+90007%2C+USA
my current address, a middle-class income, predominantly asian community, only has 1 last year and 5 in the past 5 years. and i had my car stolen just last year. needless to say, i don’t even feel that safe in my own neighbourhood. especially compared to where i was prior to USC. but compared to downtown LA? it’s a haven!
WHILE USC area is not worse compared with the rest of downtown, DOWNTOWN LA is particularly worse, compared to the suburbs or wealthy communities where many students are from.

The following incidents were reported in the USC Dept. of Public Safety incident summary between Tuesday, April 10, and Wednesday, April 12.
Crimes against property
At 9:15 p.m. on April 10, a student reported that while he was working at the front desk at Leavey Library, a suspect attempted to exit the location with a library book, causing an alarm to activate. The suspect put the book down on the desk and fled on foot. DPS officers responded and conducted a search, but were unable to locate the suspect.
At 5:08 p.m. on April 10, retail unit officers monitoring surveillance cameras observed a suspect remove the price tags from a backpack and a book and exit the Pertusati University Bookstore without paying for the items. The suspect was detained by DPS officers who responded to the scene. He was arrested and transported to 77th station for booking.
At 10:41 a.m. on April 10, a student reported that he awoke and observed a suspect inside his dorm room in Fluor Tower removing his laptop computer. The suspect handed over the computer when confronted by the student and after he left the premises the student discovered his wallet missing. DPS officers responded and conducted a search, but were unable to locate the suspect.
Miscellaneous incidents
At 3:33 p.m. on April 12, DPS officers responded to a report of three suspects loitering inside Wendy’s and detained them for investigation. A check of the suspect names revealed that one of them had two outstanding warrants. He was arrested and transported to 77th station for booking. The other suspects were advised against trespassing and released.
At 4:11 a.m. on April 11, DPS officers and LAFD Unit #15 responded to a fire alarm activation due to rain water accumulating on a roof pull station that was covered with a plastic bag at the Alan Hancock Foundation. No smoke or fire was found. LAFD was unable to reset the alarm, so FMS personnel were requested to conduct repairs and a fire watch was established by the officers. The buliding was then cleared for reentry.
At 3:46 p.m. on April 10, DPS officers and LAFD Unit #15 responded to a fire alarm that was accidentally activated by a contractor working at Cardinal Gardens. No smoke or fire was found. LAFD reset the alarm then cleared the building for reentry.
At 2:34 p.m. on April 10, a non-USC female reported that an unidentified female slammed her backpack down on a bench where she was seated near the Joint Educational Project House in an effort to intimidate her. The female did not report the incident at the time it occurred, so DPS officers were unable to question the second female.
Backpack slamming!  The new method of intimidation at JEP.

In Los Angeles, finding fast and inexpensive transportation can be a challenge for many USC students, but with the launch of Wheelz — a car-sharing company that pays car owners to rent their vehicles to other students — university officials predict that student transportation will become less of a chore.
“Wheelz is an additional transportation solution that complements our existing programs,” said Tony Mazza, director of USC Transportation. “This will provide more options to students who currently do not have access to a car as well as a way for car owners to generate income.”
Unlike Zipcar, a specialized agency that rents cars to USC students at hourly rates, Wheelz allows students with cars on campus to rent their vehicles to other students.
Molly Gerth, Wheelz’s public relations director, said students earn on average $200 a month sharing their cars and those Trojans who borrow other students’ vehicles can do so for rates much lower than those of a regular rental car agency.
“It’s a great system because the money goes back to your peers, you save on parking and it helps limit traffic congestion,” Gerth said. “Plus, it’s convenient for students who need cars on short notice.”
Wheelz’s car-sharing system is keyless so students do not have to meet to exchange keys. Wheelz installs a free electronic device inside participating students’ cars so students who rent the car can download a mobile application that automatically unlocks the vehicle upon arriving.
Wheelz Marketing and Communication Director Aaron Platshon said Wheelz has a $1-million insurance policy that protects car owners and drivers from accidents and theft and provides a 24/7 roadside assistance service.
“Although Wheelz drivers have been driving safely and responsibly, we understand accidents do happen and we must be prepared,” Platshon said.
Wheelz first launched at Stanford last September and has since expanded to UC Berkeley, UCLA and now USC.
Devon Graves, a senior majoring in philosophy, said he does not plan to participate in the program.
“There is no way I’d trust random students with my car,” Grave said. “I know [Wheelz has] an insurance policy, but there’s still way too much liability.”
Though Wheelz conducts background checks and links the car-sharing program to Facebook, car-owners cannot choose who rents their vehicle.
“What happens if I rent my car to a guy who has a little too much to drink and spills stuff all over the floor?” Graves said. “Or worse, what happens if he hits someone? I could never live with myself if I rented a car to someone who killed another driver in an accident.”
Bella Urrea, a sophomore majoring in philosophy, politics and law, said she is willing to share her car with other students.
“I would totally do it,” Urrea said. “I have a car on campus and don’t need it every day so I’d be happy to share it with fellow Trojans.”
Urrea said the income she would generate through car-sharing is not the only reason why she would participate in the program.
“It’s the sense of camaraderie. We’re the Trojan Family and I trust that students who borrow my car will treat it with respect just like I would respect their vehicles.”
Wow this idea is beyond retardation…

The Annenberg School for Communication & Journalism collaborated with two private health foundations to create a fund supporting journalists reporting on subjects related to children’s health.
Annenberg, the California Endowment and the Lucile Packard Foundation for Children’s Health created the fund, which offers a $2,000 to $5,000 grant to professional print, online or broadcast journalists.
The projects designed by applicants should shed light on critical health or policy issues that affect children’s health in California, said Michelle Levander, program director of the California Endowment Health Journalism Fellowship.
“For example, how kids make their way through the health care system, and [how] kids before wouldn’t have lived as long as they’re living now with the [same] level of severity of an ailment are rich areas for reporting,” Levander said.
Levander said stories about children’s health have changed greatly as health care has changed, specifically the increased impact of chronic diseases on the lives of children.
“What you see now is that the children who are severely ill have chronic diseases, but not necessarily fatal diseases,” Levander said. “They are very costly for the health care system and they are complex to manage.”
Levander said one example is a decrease in schools providing full-time nurses for students.
“One example is that every school used to have its own nurse, [and] that’s one arena that has been cut back greatly,” she said. “You also have kids who might have something like Type 1 diabetes where they need insulin, and so now who is going to administer the insulin? [This debate] made it really tough for the parents and the kids.”
The California Endowment Journalism Fellowship has other programs that offer reporting stipends as well. This, however, is the newest award and is distinct for its focus on children’s health Levander said.
“This is all offered under the offices of the California Endowment Health Journalism Fellowship and we are a professional education program at the Annenberg school, and we’re geared toward professional reporters and editors and we offer short training programs with mentoring over many months on story projects all focused around health,” Levander said.
Levander said if students are accepted, they will participate in a fellowship program.
“It’s a new fund that will fund reporting projects around children’s health issues,” Levander said. “[Professional journalists] will be competing to secure both a place in a weeklong national fellowship program and, based on the strength of their reporting proposal, to receive a reporting stipend for the project that they would embark upon.”

The results of the experimental online Dornsife political poll were released Thursday, detailing Californians’ opinions on issues such as gasoline prices.
The poll queried respondents’ opinion on Republican nominees, budget deficit concerns and California ballot initiatives.
The poll is an experiment based on the success of the USC Dornsife/Los Angeles Times Poll and was designed to provide more detailed feedback than a phone survey.
Though the poll found that 63 percent of respondents disagree with the way President Barack Obama handled increased gas prices, follow-up questioning revealed that only 13 percent blame him for causing the increase, as opposed to 21 percent blaming problems in the Middle East and 38 percent blaming oil companies.
Forty-seven percent of respondents said they favored Obama’s handling of the economy, while only 40 percent of respondents favored Obama’s immigration policies. In addition, the survey found that only 36 percent of respondents agreed with Obama’s handling of the budget deficit.
Dan Schnur, director of the Jesse M. Unruh Institute of Politics at USC and director of the USC Dornsife/Los Angeles Times Poll, said that the online poll was a success.
“There’s no question that the future of public opinion research will be conducted over the Internet, and we’re looking forward to learning more about how these technologies can provide an even more in-depth and timely assessment of what Californians think about the issues that matter to them,” Schnur said.
Polling was conducted March 19 to 21. A total of 1,874 registered California voters were interviewed. The experiment’s goal was to determine the advantages and practicality of conducting political polls online.
Schnur said the results of the online survey can add depth to the extensive body of already collected data by the USC Dornsife/Los Angeles Times Poll.
“This important experiment in conducting public opinion polling online will help us provide even more information about California voters and the future of the state,” Schnur said. “We are excited to partner on this opportunity to explore how polling can more closely capture voter sentiment, and we fully expect that people will be watching us closely to learn from our experiences.”

Hawai’i has a 2-2 record, while Long Beach State stands at 2-3 and Loyola Marymount trails behind at 0-4. The dual team matches will begin Saturday at 8 a.m.
Some of USC’s key players include junior Katie Fuller and sophomore Natalie Hagglund, who clinched the win in this season’s historic first game and have played a consistent, strong game since then. The pair also plays on USC’s indoor volleyball team, which finished third in its 2011 NCAA season.
The pairs championship begins Sunday at 9 a.m, and the Women of Troy are hoping that wins here will lead to invitations to participate in the American Volleyball Coaches Association Beach Collegiate Championships at the end of April.
USC has never placed below the top three in this event, earning first in 2009, tying for first in 2010 and placing second in 2011.

Redshirt sophomore safety Josh Shaw announced to reporters following Thursday’s practice that his hardship waiver had been granted a few hours earlier, and he would be eligible to play this season.
“It got approved. I’m good to go,” Shaw said.
He said that the anticipation was tough.
“We were optimistic the whole time, but [since] it took so long … we were like, ‘Man, why is it taking so long?’ But I’m just happy that it’s gotten approved and I’ll be able to play this year,” Shaw said.
Shaw, who recorded 21 tackles while appearing in seven games for the Florida Gators, transferred to USC in early January and had been waiting on news about his playing status since his arrival on campus. He is expected to have an immediate impact on the Trojans’ secondary and possibly compete for a starting job.
“[I want to] come out here and contribute to the team however I can,” Shaw said. “My goal is to be a starter here for the Trojans. This offseason, that’s what I’ll be focusing on.”
Shaw said he will try to adapt to his new surroundings with the help of one of a fellow safety, who he’s getting to know very quickly.
“Honestly, the biggest advantage for me is I’m T.J. McDonald’s roommate,” Shaw said. “So every day I’m asking him questions and he knows football. We were up last night until about 1 a.m. just going over football stuff. He really knows his stuff, so I’ll pick his brain as much as I can. I know it’s going to help me when I get out there.”
USC coach Lane Kiffin said he was happy to see a positive resolution in Shaw’s case, which allowed him to forgo sitting out next season.
“That was great,” Kiffin said. “It’s good for the team obviously, but [also] because he’s such a neat kid and he really does a lot outside of here. Just really happy for him.”
As for the new safety’s potential role with the team, Kiffin believes Shaw has a chance to compete for a starting spot right away.
“Sure, he could [start],” Kiffin said. “Somebody who has already played down in the [Southeastern Conference], played for [Florida]. He has all the right tools.”
Kiffin was also quick to compliment his secondary as a whole, one that he says has made major strides over the spring.
“Our defensive backs are extremely improved,” Kiffin said. “I think they’re playing far better than they’ve ever played since we were here. It’d be pretty neat to see what it’s like to play some pass defense and have some three-and-outs and get some interceptions.”
Meanwhile, the Trojans remain banged up on both sides of the ball, as redshirt freshman cornerback Ryan Henderson, senior linebacker Dallas Kelley, junior linebacker Marquis Simmons, redshirt sophomore tight end Randall Telfer and freshman wide receiver Victor Blackwell were unable to participate Thursday. Kiffin hopes to have Henderson and Blackwell back on Saturday, which will be the final spring practice for the Trojans.
Saturday’s practice will not have tackling, but Kiffin said he still has some objectives for his team to accomplish.
“Stay healthy, number one, and really just play some down the line guys, get them some snaps,” Kiffin said.

Fresh off the team’s first loss to rival Loyola Marymount since 2008, USC baseball will now venture into the desert, hoping to reinvigorate its season.
The Trojans are in Tempe to take on No. 22 Arizona State, a team playing its best baseball of the season with four wins in its last five games. That streak includes a tidy three-game sweep of No. 17 Oregon State last weekend.
“They’re a top program in the country,” USC coach Frank Cruz said. “They play the game very well and very hard. ‘Fearless’ is how I’d describe their game. It’s how everyone would like to play.”
Like the Trojans, the Sun Devils have struggled a bit in Pac-12 play, posting a 6-6 record. That record, however, is a bit misleading; five of the six losses were against powerhouses UCLA and Oregon, programs that are currently ranked No. 7 and No. 21 in the nation. Those losses were a result of a combined seven runs, as well.
“I expect a grind-it-out, tough weekend, which is like all weekends in the Pac-12,” Cruz said. “We just have to try and take care of our business, play fundamental baseball and we’ll be better off for it.”
The lack of fundamental baseball was a contributing factor in the Trojans’ loss to LMU on Tuesday evening. USC made three errors in the field, and left the bases loaded in three separate innings, a fact that Cruz bemoaned afterward and cited as crucial to success against a team like ASU.
“Leaving the bases loaded like that is just inexcusable,” Cruz said. “We have to be able to execute in those situations. I kind of think it’s an attitude that you have when you come to the plate. You have to relax because you can’t get up tight with men on base.”
Cruz was quick to take some of the blame for the Trojans’ loss Tuesday night.
“The other thing against LMU, I feel like we weren’t prepared to win,” Cruz said. “And that was my fault. I need to try and prepare these guys a little bit better, because I don’t think we deserved to win Tuesday night. And we didn’t.”
One thing USC cannot control is the bug going around the clubhouse. Cruz reported that several players have taken ill during the past week, which forced him to shift around his lineup on a near daily basis.
“I can only play people who are healthy,” said Cruz. “It’s a flu thing that has kind of been going around some other places, too.”
The bug might affect USC’s starting rotation for the weekend series with Arizona State. Cruz reported that freshman starting pitcher Stephen Tarpley was the latest victim of the illness, and that his availability would determine how Cruz will use his pitchers when facing the Sun Devils.
“I’m going to be held hostage to the health of our players,” Cruz said. “That’s just stuff that happens during a long season, where an illness might make its way through the team, and it’s going through us right now.”
USC will likely go with seniors Andrew Triggs and Ben Mount, its two regular Friday-Saturday starters, to take on Arizona State in the first two games of the series.
The Sun Devils have quite an answer, however, likely countering with the two-headed pitching monster of Trevor Williams and Brady Rodgers. In 16 starts, the two pitchers are 11-3 with earned run averages of 1.65 and 1.12, respectively.
Friday and Saturday’s games both begin at 6:30 p.m., with a Sunday game at 12:30 p.m. to close out the series.

It’s hard to put your trust in a freshman. Never mind the dazzling records, the overstuffed trophy case or the mile-long list of recognitions they bring with them to college. An 18-year-old with zero experience is usually not the first person one would turn to with the game on the line and nerves running sky-high.
This is true with even the most elite rookies — remember Matt Barkley? Even the most hyped quarterback recruit in USC’s history brought with him mountains of speculation and uncertainty when he took the field as a true freshman.
The Trojans ended up losing five of 13 games his first year.
A lot changes in a couple of seasons.
So it was with this mentality that I, in this very column four weeks ago, tried to downplay expectations surrounding freshman Stephen Tarpley, a highly touted, hard-throwing starting pitcher for the USC baseball team.
Despite obvious signs of talent — the Cleveland Indians drafted the 19-year-old in 2011 — I saw his youth and inexperience as more than enough reason to hold off on conjuring up images of dominance just a week into the season.
You can imagine my surprise, then, when the young left-hander took the mound against No. 6 North Carolina in early March and proceeded to throw six strong innings of baseball to earn his first win. And then he impressed again a week later, when he shut out Cal State Bakersfield for eight innings while striking out 10 batters to move to 2-0 on the season.
He didn’t stop there.
After grinding out a win against Utah, Tarpley faced his biggest challenge of the season in No. 2 Stanford. Playing in Palo Alto, Calif., the freshman bent but never broke, going 6 1/3 innings while only giving up two runs.
The Trojans wasted no time in supporting their pitcher by knocking out opposing starter John Hochstatter in just 1 2/3 innings en route to an 8-4 victory.
To top things off, Tarpley hasn’t let his early dominance faze him. Since the big win over Stanford, the lefty has gone seven innings — and counting — without giving up an earned run. He’s shown some flexibility too, coming in mid-game to bail the Trojans out of a fourth-inning jam against Loyola Marymount with the score knotted 2-2.
Seven starts, four wins — including two against top-10 teams — a 2.72 ERA and 46 strikeouts over 43 innings pitched. Not exactly the learning curve struggles you’d expect from a first-year player.
If this were another time and place, I would be sure to insert a disclaimer to every Trojan hopeful reading this — Something along the lines of: There is much more baseball to be played. The Trojans are in the thick of their best season since 2005, but with the series against Pac-12 powerhouses UCLA, Arizona and Oregon remaining, postseason hopes still sit on the backburner.
Especially with the youth that USC puts on the field from game to game, there are no guarantees this early success will hold up.
I sang a much similar tune a month ago to, fortunately, no avail. The youth, led by Tarpley and his gems on the mound, have continued to produce for a squad desperate for their contributions.
So no matter the reason behind the team’s competitive play this season, it’s apparent a change has taken place. Gone is the stale air that lingered over Dedeaux the past six seasons, miring Trojan baseball in mediocrity.
Things seem fresh, right down to the face of the 19-year-old lefty making everyone swing and miss.
Maybe freshmen aren’t so hard to trust after all.
I, for one, have gotten on board. This team has a chance to finally break through to the upper tier of the Pac-12. Heck, maybe even an NCAA tournament appearance.

After concluding regular-season road play with a perfect record, the USC men’s tennis team will return home to take on a hefty trio of great squads to finish the season.
The No. 1 Trojans (23-0, 4-0) will begin their homestand with a back-to-back, starting with No. 12 California (11-7, 4-0) Friday at 1:30 p.m., followed by No. 11 Stanford (14-5, 4-0) Saturday at 1 p.m.

Though some might see the back-to-back and a date with No. 6 UCLA next Friday as a rough way to end the season, the Trojans would not have it any other way.
“This is going to be a good way to prepare for the NCAAs. Each match is going to be tough, but it’s definitely an advantage for us,” senior Daniel Nguyen said.
Fellow senior Steve Johnson agreed.
“The competition is only going to make us stronger for the NCAAs,” Johnson said. “It’s going to be a fun weekend.”
Johnson and Nguyen, who are ranked No. 2 and No. 17 in singles, respectively, have led the Trojans as they ride a 43-match win streak dating back to last February.
Johnson currently holds a 55-match win streak in singles, while Nguyen looks to rebound after Utah’s Slim Hamza snapped his 12-match win streak last Friday.
USC has three other ranked singles players in No. 20 sophomore Ray Sarmiento, No. 43 freshman Yannick Hanfmann and No. 56 sophomore Emilio Gomez.
Though the Trojans feature an accomplished corps of singles players, their doubles pairs, led by the No. 15 duo in Johnson and freshman Roberto Quiroz, have not dropped a game since March 15.
“You get a lot of confidence from your doubles points, and all of us have improved on our doubles,” Nguyen said.
While the Trojans hold plenty of momentum, they are aware that their winning streak could end at any moment, especially against the upcoming competition.
“Stanford was missing their number one guy when we were up there. He’s back in the lineup so that’s definitely going to make them much stronger,” Johnson said. “Cal is always a dangerous team. They’re good any given day.”
The Golden Bears are led by the trio of No. 41 Ben McLachlan, No. 55 Nick Andrews and No. 57 Carlos Cueto. In their last match-up in February, USC took a 5-2 win from Berkeley.
No. 46 Bradley Klahn, who was absent from Stanford’s 0-7 loss to USC in February because of a back injury, stands alongside No. 30 Ryan Thacher for the Cardinal.
“We just have to take care of what we do every single day,” Gomez said. “We have to be ready for whatever circumstances come up on Friday and Saturday.”
As the regular season winds down and the postseason quickly approaches, the graduating seniors have found time to appreciate the luxury of having their last three matches all at home.
“It’s special. Being a senior, it’s going to be my last matches, and to end Daniel’s and my career at home is going to be something special for both of us,” Johnson said.

The No. 1 USC Trojans men’s volleyball team swept the No. 8 Long Beach State 49ers with scores of 25-17, 28-26 and 25-19 for their 16th straight victory on Thursday evening at the Long Beach Pyramid. The victory gives the Trojans (21-4, 17-4) a share of the Mountain Pacific Sports Federation title and puts them one win away from clinching the top seed in the MPSF playoffs.

The Pyramid in Long Beach is known in college volleyball to give the 49ers a huge home-court advantage due to its unique structure and its effect on visitors’ depth perception. Coupled with the 49ers (14-14, 9-12) desperation to clinch a bid in the eight-team MPSF tournament, the visit was a potential trap-match for the Trojans.
“We’re thrilled to win this and get it out of the way. It’s a tough venue to play in. Hitting high balls is tough in here,” said USC coach Bill Ferguson. “They served really tough and they have one of the better home court advantages in the league.”
National Player of the Year candidate Tony Ciarelli reeled off four straight kills en route to a 5-0 start to the match. The 11 aces are a USC match record.
“Tony’s serving was unbelievable,” Ferguson said. “He’s had an unbelievable amount of focus in preparing for each of these matches.”
The Trojans staved off a 24-25 deficit in the second set after two straight hitting errors. Instead of folding, senior middle blocker and co-captain Steven Shandrick came up with a big block and a game-winning service ace to win in a 28-26 tiebreak.
“I needed that. I had a rough stretch in hitting over the course of the match,” Shandrick said. “Those points mentally got me back in the game and got me and the team fired up for the third set.”
The Trojans have not lost to a team ranked lower than them this year and have dropped only seven sets during the 16-match winning streak.
“It’s good to get the win in the pressure cooker,” Ferguson said. “I’m proud of how we responded in the second set in such a tough environment.”
Ciarelli led the way with nine kills to go and received plenty of help from his teammates. Freshman middle blocker Robert Feathers finished with four kills earned at a .667 clip and junior opposite Maddison McKibbin finished with five kills earned at a .571 clip in one set off the bench.
The Trojans head to No. 11 Cal State Northridge on Saturday evening in hopes of clinching the MPSF title. Cal State Northridge (11-16, 7-13) is fighting to clinch a spot in the MPSF playoffs.
“We want to win the outright because sharing sucks. There are a lot of things riding on this match. We need to keep playing for our pride and for each other,” Shandrick said. “If we keep playing like we do and keep improving like we do we’re setting ourselves up for a win.”

Faith is a very personal matter, yet many religious institutions seem impenetrable and devoid of humanity. Very rarely does a religious figure’s personality shine past the responsibilities they hold — especially if that person happens to be the pope.
A large part of the brilliance of We Have a Pope comes from the questioning of that idea. With the film, Italian writer, director and actor Nanni Moretti takes on an audacious premise concerning Catholicism’s most venerable authority. Thankfully, he also decides to make it a quirky character study rather than a high-stakes, melodramatic take on the subject.

The film opens in the Vatican, as the College of Cardinals prepares to hold a papal conclave to elect the new pope. The media — and the cardinals — are busy weighing the odds and guessing who will head the church. After the first few rounds of decision-making produce no results, the cardinals choose an unlikely candidate: the quiet Cardinal Melville (Michel Piccoli). But when it comes time to introduce him to the waiting faithful, the new pope panics and runs away.
It’s a powerful opening, and one that shows off the film’s two great strengths: its brilliant direction and odd sense of humor. In the middle of grand processions and serious voting, the film depicts cardinals awkwardly apologizing as they stumble or gamely try to keep track of the vote count for the papacy.
Cleverly, at the same time the cardinals outwardly flash impish smiles during the voting process, Moretti saturates the conclave hall with the projected inner thoughts of the various cardinals, which show them all worried or deep in prayer. The noise accumulates until it’s one loud cacophony, then suddenly cuts back to a quiet room.
And during Melville’s first breakdown, Moretti pulls the camera back slowly, leaving the otherwise grand figure of the pope merely as a small figure in an ornate Vatican meeting chamber. Moretti fills the film with moments like these, and each one is more fascinating than the last.
Part of why and how this works so well is because of the actors involved. Piccoli is perfect as Melville, playing the newly elected pope as saintly and kind but overwhelmed by the role that has been put upon him. The moments when stress gets to him and he snaps are constantly surprising and show that Piccoli’s acting range is far greater than just playing a sweet old man.
The other pillar to the film is the psychoanalyst (played by Moretti) brought in to help the pope. Witty, arrogant, unrestained and far more energetic than the clergy, the doctor soon finds himself forced to stay in the Vatican, as the conclave is still technically in effect. There, the manic doctor has to find a way to stay sane.
We Have a Pope combines all its good elements for the psychoanalyst’s big meeting with the pope himself. Moretti and Piccoli play off each other very well, and the scene is hilarious, as the interview is forced to take place in front of all the attentive and fidgety cardinals.
Sadly, this is their only scene together, and it feels like a missed opportunity as the film moves in a different direction — and takes a tumble. Piccoli and Moretti are extremely talented in their roles, and the supporting cast is strong, but the interesting premise at the start of the film gives way to more drawn-out elements and little in the way of plot progression. And even humorously crazed actors producing a Chekhov play and slow-motion scenes of the cardinals playing volleyball — another one of the film’s quirky, funny moments — can’t make up for that fumble.
By the time the third act is well underway, it just feels like Moretti is scrambling for a way to resolve the film’s story. We Have a Pope’s resolution, though once again supremely staged and shot, feels awkward and rushed. It’s an odd and underwhelming end to an otherwise enticing film.
In the end, We Have a Pope falls short of its potential. The film is an offbeat and whimsical look at a serious subject, and Moretti’s approach to the Vatican and its members is fascinating. But the problem isn’t Moretti’s direction or the actors’ performances — it’s the plot. And as hard as the cast and crew have tried, they can’t overcome that shortcoming.

Many successful rap songs feature memorable guest appearances. What would Jay-Z’s “Empire State of Mind” have sounded like without Alicia Keys? Or how would B.o.B’s smash hit “Airplanes” have fared without the assistance of Paramore frontwoman Hayley Williams?
The hip-hop genre is notorious for eccentric and unexpected, yet highly successful collaborations. They allow rap to stay fresh in a fashion that no other genre really embraces.
Sure, rockers Green Day and U2 collaborated to cover the Skids’ “The Saints are Coming” in 2006, but guest spots like that one are generally hard to come by.
There is, for example, no record outside of rap that could compare to Kanye West and Jay-Z’s 2011 release Watch the Throne. Not only did these two wildly popular rappers collaborate on the entire album, but they also did a full tour together in support of it.
And the results were staggering. The tour’s worldwide gross garnered more than $48 million, and the record was certified platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America a mere five weeks after its release date.
A good number of rappers attract a massive amount of attention on their own — such as Eminem. But adding an unexpected artist to elevate the song to a whole new level will almost certainly draw in even more listeners.
Rap songs, for the most part, are not known for being catchy. With Eminem, his catalogue is very emotionally charged and the verses are so rapid-fire that it is hard to remember what he is saying after one initial listen.
If Rihanna were to join forces with him, however, like she did on “Love the Way You Lie,” then listeners will have something catchier to sing along to. Accordingly, her vocals do not overpower the track, but rather provide a break from the verses, allowing listeners to appreciate them more and look forward to what will come after the chorus.
Jay-Z and West took part in something similar on Watch the Throne, even though they are rappers. The duo kept listeners on their toes throughout the album, forcing them to wonder who would sing next. This in turn created an exciting experience that generated a heavy amount of interest and even friendly debate about who contributed more to the songs.
This sentiment is equally as strong with present-day releases as well. Rapper B.o.B just announced the track listing Monday for his sophomore release, Strange Clouds, due in stores May 1, which includes a motley assortment of guest vocals.
Among the artists featured on Strange Clouds are T.I., Chris Brown, Trey Songz, Lil Wayne, Nicki Minaj, Taylor Swift and Morgan Freeman. Without having heard a single note, you cannot deny the fact that these guest spots are intriguing, especially the last two.
As a country-pop star, Swift is certainly not the first person that comes to mind when considering possible collaborations for B.o.B. But the biggest, most glaring and bewildering collaboration is with actor Morgan Freeman on the song “Bombs Away.”
“Bombs Away” is the opening track on the album and it is already generating a large wave of speculation as to what role Freeman will actually play. For now, all fans can do is guess because no further clues have been revealed about the alliance.
Meanwhile, the album’s first single, “Strange Clouds,” was released Sept. 27, 2011, and featured a guest appearance from rapper heavyweight Lil Wayne.
Lil Wayne’s verse comes right after the first chorus and provides a nice change of pace while adding an extra punch of star power to the track. But if B.o.B had not enlisted Lil Wayne, it is hard to imagine the track being anywhere near as effective.
In essence, guest spots on rap albums are beneficial because they bring out the best in artists. B.o.B is an excellent and innovative rapper on his own, but with icon Lil Wayne rapping alongside, B.o.B steps up his game.
Collaboration challenges these artists to work with each other to try to outdo themselves, and the results often leave listeners with a much more powerful piece of art than they would have had otherwise.
All of this is not to say that every rap song needs to be collaborative. There is enough talent in the genre for one man or woman to create an influential solo work.
But commercial success and acclaim are much easier to come by if rappers amp up their firepower with collaborations. After all, two heads are better than one, especially when they creatively figure out a way to share the spotlight.

In a world with racial profiling, ever-increasing interest in gangster rap and an alarming absence of minorities in media, filmmaker and actor Mario Van Peebles wants to repair the image of blacks frame by frame with a positive vision as well as a new film: We the Party.
In many ways, Van Peebles is the exact opposite of the popular Tyler Perry. Though Perry’s films have seen success at the box office, numerous critics and scholars have derided Perry for his often degrading depiction of blacks. Instead, Van Peebles looks for variability in the roles he offers black actors.

“Tyler Perry doesn’t particularly bother me,” Van Peebles said. “It’s just that I don’t think that [his] representation is helpful.”
For Van Peebles, the issue at hand is the lack of diversity not only in representations of black people but also in who’s behind the camera.
“That’s the problem [Perry] may have,” Van Peebles said. “He’s become an ambassador to us. It’s not that his vision is particularly right or wrong, it’s just that it’s one vision. When the Project X or The Hangover guys came out with their films, they weren’t forced to be ambassadors for their people.”
In any case, Van Peebles isn’t one to just sit around and criticize.
“There are three kinds of folks: people that watch sh-t happen, people that complain and people that make stuff happen,” Van Peebles said. “I’ve always been the latter.”
Van Peebles has built his career around pursuing projects with authentic, honest stories and people. His breakthrough project, New Jack City, dealt with drug trafficking in 1980s New York while the 2004 biopic BAADASSSSS! highlighted his father Melvin’s own cinematic achievement, Sweet Sweetback’s Baadasssss Song.
His most recent film, We the Party, is Van Peebles’ attempt to accurately portray the lives of high-school students in Baldwin Hills, Calif. A dramatic departure from his usually heavy fare, the film tells the story of 16-year-old Hendrix, played by Van Peebles’ own son Mandela.
In the film, Hendrix doesn’t do drugs or belong to a gang; Hendrix is simply a high school junior who’s dealing with a crush on the popular girl, Cheyenne (Simone Battle), and pressure from his parents, played by Salli Richardson-Whitfield and Mario Van Peebles.
“I’m just trying to show young black folks in school in a positive way,” Van Peebles said. “Hendrix is just a young brother trying to get his grades up.”
The family reunion doesn’t stop with the director and his son — the director cast all five of his children in We the Party, and even had his iconic father Melvin make an appearance as Big D.
Some films are derailed by the presence of untrained actors; however, We the Party succeeds in its ability to pull out naturalistic performances from the young Van Peebleses, perhaps because of the fact that the characters were based on them to begin with.
The inspiration for the film came to Van Peebles in a funny way: His children wanted desperately to attend a bunch of all-ages clubs, and he told them they could go on the condition that he joined them.
“So they dressed me up in skinny jeans and sneakers and I went ‘incognegro’ with them to the clubs as part of their entourage,” Van Peebles said with a laugh.
Once there, he received insight into a world he had seldom known before. Music, dance battles and cute girls permeated the club, giving Van Peebles the inspiration to portray the lives of young black people in the most honest way possible. It’s this desire for authenticity that led him to cast his children and father, his old co-star Richardson-Whitfield and even the legendary artist Snoop Dogg.
The rapper’s inclusion is telling, as the music scene’s influence on the film is evident: We the Party flaunts multiple montages set to contemporary hip-hop, characters participating in rap battles and many guest appearances from musicians such as the New Boyz.
All together, the film feels like one long music video full of energy and passion. And though the style is fun to see on-screen, the film’s ideals are even more impressive. Van Peebles’ ultimate goal was to make a movie that children can identify with — one filled with strong, level-headed black characters who don’t just entertain but inspire, even through adulthood and parenthood.
“Any knucklehead can have a kid,” Van Peebles said. “The thing is to get them through college —  to help you grow yourself. And maybe they can even inspire you to make a movie.”

The Los Angeles Police Department announced Thursday that USC will offer a $125,000 reward for information that leads to the conviction of those found guilty of the murder of two USC graduate students.
Ying Wu and Ming Qu, second-year electrical engineering graduate students, were fatally shot Wednesday morning.
LAPD will hold a press conference Friday at 1 p.m. at the crime scene in the 2700 block of Raymond Avenue.
Anyone with information is asked to call  Detectives Vince Carreon or Eloy Ochoa of the LAPD’s Criminal Gang Homicide Division at (213) 485-4341, or the Detective Information Desk at the 24-hour toll free number 877-LAPD-24-7, or TTY (877-275-5273).

So dear “Parent”, for the safety of your child that is still going to school there, please donate some money and make the reward larger. That’s the best way to keep your child safe!
>> $125,000. should have been spent on security and safety for our children who are students at USC BEFORE they >> are gunned down and murdered. raped and robbed , what price a life?
You just don’t understand. The best way to deter criminals is to make sure whoever committed the crimes get punished. So I would say the reward is very very well justified!!!
Thanks for pointing this out, Yifu. I was just about to do the same. Lets not make this tragedy about race or money when it isn’t about those things at all. May the two victims rest in peace. We should all be focusing on offering love and support to their families, friends, and the USC community during this difficult time.
As a Chinese student , I wanna say that American society is quite diffrent from that in China. Chinese students lack the conscious and experience of coping with gun shots or robbery  like that cauz our country doesn’t permit civilians to own guns. To students , it’s dangerous to stay outside in the mid night in the United States, they are vulnerable to those crimes.They can’t fight back. If sth happens, pleaz never fight back. TO GOVERNMENT: I know u always support civilian guns’ permission in the states for the reason of protecting ur interest, thou it’s bullshit, u need to garantee students’ lives without costs! WE SEND　OUR CHILDREN TO YOUR COUNTRY FOR LEARNING !! CHINA　is poorer but safer than the USA! YOU SHOULD BE ASHAMED OF THAT.  Ability means responsibility
Not one word from Nikias, not one–he who is the architect of the new over-crowded USC, stretching our resources past the point of breaking.
Too much too soon. “Sprinting through a Marathon” is never a good idea, President Nikias. We are all watching and listening–we are not all cheering.
Slow down, your are making some big mistakes.
I for one, will not allow my second child to attend USC, too preoccupied with ego at the expense of the welfare of the students.
To parent: I respectfully disagree. A lenient  liberal criminal code which protects criminals rather than law-abiding citizens is to blame. If every crackheads on the streets who commit murdering, raping and robbing were to be caught and severely punished, the criminals would be much less rampant. 
By the way, USC offered 135000 for info on a hit-and-run incident in which a white student was killed. I believe the life of 2 Chinese students worth no less than that of a white student.
USC actually offered 50,000 out of 135,000 for that case, the other was offered by others.
This may sound crude and I know that a reward is largely symbolic, but that is too close to the cost of tuition for two years of grad school for two students.  
It might give the impression that the university values these students based solely on tuition.
You have a point.
But if you are the parent of the victims, can you still say that?
$125,000. should have been spent on security and safety for our children  who are students at USC BEFORE they are gunned down and murdered. raped and robbed , what price a life? off duty police who need extra money could have been hired to patrol all of these unsafe areas where students live.. Clean up this and all the areas now!
so sad.  I am so sad for their family and these students.
I have seen suspicious people racing up and down the row looking for oppertunities to rob..
You need speed bumps there as well to slow down the traffic so the security cameras can record. and slow the cars down so noone is hit by a car.. that is another issue but USC is asleep when it regards safety of their students especially the women.  they hush up the crime.  why dont I ever see LAPD driving around and patroling?
You can sure get a parking ticket but safety patrol cars? never see them. what else is it going to take USC?

Ambitious punk-rock band Green Day is hitting the recording studio again, but this time they don’t intend to complete just one measly album, but a trilogy of albums that will be released consecutively in 2012 and 2013.
The first album, titled ¡UNO!, is scheduled to be released on Tuesday, September 25, 2012, with the next two installments following respectively on November 13, 2012 and January 15, 2013.
Lead singer Billie Joe Armstrong announced this triple threat Wednesday. As of now, it’s unclear what the content and sound of the albums will be, but the band says to expect something epic.
“Every song has the power and energy that represents Green Day on all emotional levels,” said the band. “We just can’t help ourselves.”
Green Day has transformed a lot since its humble beginnings as a noisy pop-punk band, playing underground shows and shoving over the amplifiers for the sake of shoving over the amplifiers. The band was part of the 924 Gilman Street punk scene in Berkeley, Calif. Many fans back in the day considered Green Day to be a sellout when they signed to Reprise Records, a move that in part helped catapult the band’s next album Dookie to commercial success.
The band’s sound has grown since its early days in the late 80s; it has become less grungy, more polished and increasingly conceptual as demonstrated by their political rock-opera success American Idiot, which was followed in 2009 by the somewhat less epic 21st Century Breakdown.
The band has been working on songs since the tour of their last album and things are finally coming together.
“We are at the most prolific and creative time in our lives,” said the band in a statement released by their publicist. “This is the best music we’ve ever written, and the songs just keep coming.”

Detectives found no signs of struggle at the scene where Ming Qu and Ying Wu were shot and killed early Wednesday morning, LAPD Supervising Detective Sal LaBarbera said.
LaBarbera said Qu got out of the vehicle to seek help after he and Wu were shot. Officers found Qu collapsed on the front porch of Wu’s residence on the 2700 block of Raymond Avenue. Wu was found in the front passenger seat of the 2003 BMW. The car was double-parked with its hazard lights flashing.
[Correction: An earlier version indicated that the vehicle was a late-model BMW 3-series. The Daily Trojan has confirmed that the vehicle was a 2003 BMW. The Daily Trojan regrets this error.]
The gunman approached the driver’s side of the vehicle where Qu sat and fired multiple shots from five to six feet away, according to LaBarbera. Detectives said the gunman fled south on Raymond Avenue.
Detectives said no DNA from the suspect was obtained at the scene. Rain was pouring down at the time of the shooting and might have washed away possible evidence, LaBarbera said.
Investigators believe the suspected male shooter acted alone. No further description of a suspect has been released. Detectives are reviewing surveillance footage from nearby businesses on Normandie Avenue, and footage obtained from DPS surveillance and license plate recognition cameras in the area. There are no cameras stationed directly on Raymond Avenue.
LaBarbera said gang members live in the neighborhoods north and south of the block where the shooting occurred, but the block where Wu lived is home to mostly families and students. Detectives have not determined a motive or whether the shooting was gang-related.
“We do have some good leads that we’re working on,” LaBarbera said. “We have over a dozen homicide detectives working on the case.”
Members of the FBI, DPS Officers and LAPD Officers from the Southwest Division are also assisting with the investigation.
please protect our children now.. these are unsafe places.
we love our children.. they deserve to feel safe..
I am sadened for the family and these poor dedicated students who worked hard to be here . and never even got to see their family in the end.. so horrible. the parents never even  got to say good bye to their children who worked so hard to be here and now gunned down and murdered. enough is enough. stop stop killing! stop raping, stop robbing,  the police need to protect the innocent! and usc needs to protect their students now! Is this what it takes? my heart is crying. we have an unsafe country.. this must stop! God help us all. God bless this family.
DPS needs to expand its area as follows:
NORTH to 22nd St
WEST covering the area north of Adams between Vermont and Hoover
WEST covering the area south of Adams between Vermont and Normandie
Campus Cruiser should also deliver within these same bounds; wherever students live between Figueroa and Normandie/22nd and Exposition, Campus Cruiser should go.
Please do something to protect us. We live here with fear now. We are really really scared.
Expand the DPS  control area to North West part please since a lot of students live there!
Shame on No camera on Raymond Ave!! Just expand the DPS patrol area to North-West area please!!
Hey DPS, care to protect our students?

Jiangzang Zhang, a teaching assistant for an electrical engineering class, planned to return a midterm during office hours Wednesday morning. Zhang said he was surprised when Ying Wu, a student who is typically one of the first to arrive, had not shown up.
“She’s usually one of the first people there, and I couldn’t see her,” Zhang said. “After about 1 p.m., the news came out.”
After checking Facebook, Zhang learned that Wu and her friend Ming Qu had been fatally shot around 1 a.m. The shooting took place near the intersection of Raymond Avenue and 27th Street, about three blocks west of Vermont Avenue.
“I was really shocked, actually,” Zhang said. “And I also feel sad because she’s somebody so close. I’ve known her for about a year.”
Zhang said Wu and Qu, both 23-year-old graduate students from China studying electrical engineering, were studious and diligent.
“Those people are incredibly hardworking, study at the library until 1 a.m. and then go back home,” Zhang said. “It’s not because they go to a party or something.”
In the wake of the double homicide, USC students and residents of Raymond Avenue expressed grief and shock and reflected on safety precautions near campus.
J.P. Chehade, a graduate student studying civil engineering, said he feels safer because of the security presence on campus.
“I wouldn’t feel OK if the security wasn’t there when I have to walk back to my car,” Chehade said. “Security makes a difference.”
Dept. of Public Safety Capt. David Carlisle said the incident emphasizes the importance for students to remain aware of their surroundings.
“What it points out is that all of us — students, faculty and staff — have to be ever vigilant because this situation may occur wherever you may be,” Carlisle said.
Sam Levy, a junior majoring in civil engineering, said the shooting has not changed his perception of safety around USC because of its distance from campus.
“I saw the location, which seemed pretty far from campus,” Levy said. “Double homicide is pretty big, but I feel like it was far enough away where I don’t feel any more in danger now than I was before. Raymond and Normandie doesn’t feel that close to me.”
Several residents of the 2700 block of Raymond Avenue said they were woken by the gunshots early Wednesday.
“I remember I was sleeping,” said Johnny Rivera, a 22-year-old student at East Los Angeles College. “I was so deep into my sleep. I just dropped down to the floor, and I kind of panicked because I have my sisters in the house and everybody.”
Rivera said, in recent years, more USC students have moved into the area. He said USC students should remain aware of their surroundings, but some of the concerns about safety are exaggerated.
“I’ve lived here my whole life, situations like this don’t occur that much,” Rivera said. “They should be aware, but it’s not even as bad as they say it is, like in movies.”
DPS has not had a report of violent crime in that neighborhood this year, Carlisle said.
“This particular crime occurred in an area that doesn’t have a history of violent crime,” he said.
Lynn Rossi, a Raymond resident who works as an armed security guard, said she also heard the gunshots Wednesday morning. Sitting on the wooden porch of her residence, Rossi said she believes the neighborhood is generally safe.
“I think it’s safe for students, but I do think there needs to be better security in this area in general,” Rossi said. “There should be more patrols through here.”
Though the neighborhood is about three blocks outside DPS’s patrol boundaries, Carlisle said DPS has some license plate recognition cameras on the perimeter of the neighborhood and some video patrol cameras in the community.
“It’s a tragic crime, one that’s very rare,” Carlisle said. “It’s an aberration and our hearts go out to the families of these poor students.”

USC has done a lot to protect all of their students and the community around the school. I read that they hired many new “Ambassadors” that monitor various locations. This is probably helpful but it does not take the place of trained professional officers on patrol. I passed by the school today and it looks like a fortune has been spent on new buildings. Please use some more of your resources to increase, equip, and train professional DPS officers to help deal with the less than human menaces to society beings out there who prey on any innocent person rich or poor who crosses their paths. Ambassadors and cameras may help but they don’t hook & book the bad guys.
DRIVE BY–Catalina Street–about a quarter mile from Raymond–ONE DEAD.
Look it up–get your facts straight MR. “AT LEAST, GET YOUR FACTS STRAIGHT”
Could you at least provide a link to a news story? I seriously cannot find a single news article about this supposed shooting…
http://www.annenbergtvnews.com/index.php/news/story/shooting_screams_reported_near_popular_usc_housing_area/
A non-USC student was shot in a drive-by…but it wasn’t anywhere near Catalina (it was 29th and Hoover), so I don’t know. And I think that case ended up being a targeted shooting? They weren’t aiming for or targeting any students, just this one guy….but I have no idea if this is even the case Amanda was referring to…
and that was the only thing i could find that might be remotely related? I don’t know what Amanda is talking about either. I would appreciate someone providing links too. Amanda, could you give us a source? I can’t recall any drive by shooting incidents during my time at USC, other than the one I found…
I won’t blame Frank at all for his contemplation about the artificial showing-off brand new BMW because that’s exactly what the first news report tried to insinuate there.  And as usual the media managed to manipulate common people’s mindset, including Frank’s, to believe it is some random and unlucky incident, not for any security’s fault but more for a wealthy asian pimp’s flashy pants.
I agree with you CK. Frank you need to get your facts in order. And don’t give us “well it’s still a BMW…” diatribe. I’m well aware of the types of cares in University Park and West Adams and rest assured there are plenty of ‘premium vehicles’ afoot in these locations.
As for you Oregon Mom, you can’t stop the youth from being the youth. No one should be forced to live in shades of grey. But the youth can help each other out by being mindful of each other.
The sad fact is that many asian immigrants aren’t aware to the many dangers posed in the city. They are frequent targets of crime given their lack of “streets smarts” and english language limitations. Nonetheless, we as a community must look after one another for safety and protection. DPS and LAPD do what they can, but untimely it is up to the community and the individual.
Rest in Peace, my heart goes out to you and your families.
Neighborhood not known for violent crime?
Let’s be honest USC, in the last year this particular neighborhood had a drive-by shooting resulting in death.
Last year two students were shot–one nearly died.
This year both students died in this particualr shooting.
If my neighborhood had five people shot in the last year, I would move. 
This neighborhood is violent–not to say the people are bad or violent but the neighborhood is violent. Students are living west of USC simply because there is no housing closer to campus–this is a result of the School adding , over the last two years, approxmately 5,000 additional students without having the place to house them.
Bad policiy, Nikias, in my opinion.
Drive by shooting in the last year? Where? There have been plenty of shootings all over LA in the last year, but a “drive by shooting” within 2 or 3 miles of USC? Nope. There are no news stories whatsoever about anything like that…if you are going to make a claim like that, you need to provide sources, please.
As for your other reference–the shooting on 37th Place in September was more than a mile south of this incident. That is not considered the same neighborhood–the “neighborhood” they are referring to here is the specific area these students were living, which technically falls out of the DPS patrol zone. The 2700 block of Raymond is therefore not considered the same as the 1200 block of 37th Place.
And to be fair, one of the students in the 37th Place incident was shot in the hand because she reached up to block the gun and the bullet went through her hand before hitting the second person. Her injuries were reported as “minor.” The male student that was hit went into surgery and was listed in critical condition for a day or two, but he thankfully recovered well. It also wasn’t some random shooting on the street. It happened at a crowded apartment party that was unregulated, unregistered, and opened to the public. That is a completely different situation from what happened here.
You are right that there isn’t enough student housing available–that is a valid issue that needs to be addressed. But walling students off in secluded university housing isn’t going to make the reality of living in a major metropolitan area go away.
Your “facts” come straight out of your ass, it seems like.
uh, in what way? sounds like everything they said was completely based on fact and mostly taken from reputable news sources…how is anything that they said wrong?
Frank — get your facts straight. The “new” BMW you speak of was a used 2003 model that he had recently purchased to commute to work. No one should have to “dress in rags and drive an old beat up car” to be guaranteed safety.
It’s easy for students to let their guard down as they become comfortable at USC. My own student has reported going home at 3, 4 in the morning after off campus parties. I don’t care if you have to wait for campus cruiser, get a ride home for God’s sake. Always walk with a friend at night. Take off your ear buds. Not to blame any potential victims, but think twice about dressing like a stripper when you’re headed on buses to off campus parties. I think the campus itself is likely as safe as it can be. But you are going to school in one of the biggest cities in the country, at a wealthy university surrounded by a low income area. You are ripe for the picking. Take this horrific tragedy as a reminder of these realities. We parents are sacrificing so much to send you there. Do your part to stay safe.
You hit the nail on the head with your comments.  Common sense plays a key role in one’s personal safety.
I agree with you completely. From what I heard in the news they were driving a new BMW. One thing everyone must keep in mind is you have to blend in with the surroundings. Being an Asian international student sticks out like a sore thumb already this plus driving a flashy car is two strikes against you. Things like this happens everyday all over the world in big or small cities and please don’t blame security as they are not there to babysit you. Be street smart, be aware of your surroundings and most important don’t be a show off. I am sure if they dress in rags and drive an old beat up car, this might not have happened.
The car was bought for $10k and was almost a decade old.  Compare to some of the cars I see legit rich $poiled children driving… the car the victims drove was a clunker at best.
WOW, you are sure? Easy for you to say since you weren’t the one who got jumped and shot in the face.
Way to victim blame young women; the old adage of “she dressed like a stripper, she was asking for it” is old and hackneyed. As a mother and a female, you should be ashamed.
Scumbags cause crime, not short skirts.

Many students were disappointed Wednesday after learning that an email from the Office of Campus Activities — about entering a raffle to win field passes to the USC vs. Hawai’i football season opener — was actually a prank orchestrated by the secret society Skull and Dagger.
Skull and Dagger prefaced the prank by blacking out TV monitors on campus and replacing their content with a 24-hour countdown at noon on Tuesday, when the club then sent out the emails at noon on Wednesday.
Prank · Skull and Dagger, a secret society at USC, unfurled its banner at the Student Union after sending a prank email to some students. - Chris Roman | Daily Trojan
The email, titled “Win Free Field Passes for USC vs. Hawai’i Season Opener!” was issued from the email address of Heather Larabee, the assistant dean of students and director of campus activities.
The contents of the email included a link for students to register for the field passes, but upon clicking the link, students were directed to a website that played the sound of a woman screaming while a message saying, “You’ve been pranked by Skull & Dagger. Fight on!” appeared.
Grace Ko, a freshman majoring in theatre, said she was not amused by the prank.
“I had overheard people talking about the raffle for free field tickets for the football game, and I was initially very excited until I learned it was a prank,” Ko said. “[Skull and Dagger members] should really get something better to do in their free time than having fun at other students’ expense.”
It was a pretty big fail on their part–the countdowns definitely had everyone wondering what was going on, but a large chunk of the student population didn’t even get the email.
Ya pretty lame.  Skull and dagger needs to step it up.
What a lame prank.
Skull and Dagger is supposed to be some of the best, handpicked students on campus… and this is what their collective brainpower/funnybone could muster? Seriously?

USC Libraries has announced Crocker Business Library, located in Hoffman Hall, will be open with extended hours for finals this semester because of students’ increased use of the library.
USC Libraries tracks the number of students visiting libraries each semester. These numbers are used to decide which libraries would be most advantageous to have extended hours.
Hugh McHarg, associate dean of planning and communications for USC Libraries, said this decision aims to meet students’ needs.
“We get a lot of students asking where else they can study because Leavey is too crowded,” McHarg said. “We want to look at areas where we can serve more people with study space most efficiently.”
The reason Crocker Library has not been open with extended hours in the past is because of the difficulty in keeping libraries that are located within specific departments open, McHarg said.
“Not all libraries stand alone,” he said. “We have to make special arrangements with other departments and units responsible for that subject area. The Marshall School of Business is contributing by providing extra security so the building and library can be open longer for students.”
The USC Libraries’ decision to keep Crocker Library open longer during finals is part of their 2011-2013 Essential Library Strategic Plan, which aims to enhance the libraries’ key services for students.
“The plan focuses on providing intellectual and physical environments for students, [increasing] the amount of study space available, as well as the maximum number of hours these spaces are open,” McHarg said.
Students in Marshall said they are thankful USC Libraries has acknowledged the need to have the Crocker Library open longer because it will provide business students with a valuable place to study.
“I definitely intend to use the library during finals,” said Leinate Abulaiti, a junior majoring in business administration. “If you’re studying for a business-related class, then immersing yourself in a business-related environment may provide you with different input and perspectives.”
Kathryn Haugen, a junior majoring in business administration, said Crocker Library is convenient for group studying as well.
“It’s useful for business students mainly because much of our work involves group projects and so it’s nice to have the library open later, especially at the end of year,” Haugen said. “It will be very convenient for study groups to have access to the private study rooms in Crocker because many times, rooms in Leavey are overbooked.”
Haugen said she was happy USC Libraries is responding to students’ needs.
“It shows that the libraries really care about the students,” Haugen said. “I know that a ton of business students have been asking for this, and it’s great to have the libraries respond and hear what students are saying.”

Hundreds of students and faculty gathered for a candlelight vigil at Tommy Trojan Wednesday night to remember the lives of Ying Wu and Ming Qu, two graduate students who were fatally shot Wednesday morning.
Wu and Qu were Chinese international students studying electrical engineering. John O’Brien, executive vice dean of engineering at the Viterbi School of Engineering, said the school has been greatly affected by the loss.

“I know that around the world the Viterbi community has been shaken by the news of this tragedy,” O’Brien said.
The Chinese Students & Scholars Association, the USC Office of Religious Life and several other organizations on campus collaborated to host the event. Wei Nan Wang, president of CSSA, emphasized that the vigil was meant for the entire USC community.
“We need to be more cautious,” Wang said. “This is for all students on campus, not just the Chinese.”
Varun Soni, dean of religious life, discussed the importance of campus unification after the unexpected loss of two students.
“We are struck silent, yet we feel the need to speak,” Soni said. “Now our community is even more important.”
Kalgi Desai, a freshman majoring in accounting, did not know the victims personally but said she felt a connection to them.
“I’m also an international student, and I came for grief and sharing the sorrow,” Desai said.
A family friend of Qu, who requested her name not be disclosed, spoke in Chinese about the hardships of being an international student, according to Clayton Dube, executive director of the USC U.S.-China Institute.
Denzil Suite, associate vice president for student affairs, said the Trojan Family will overcome the grief of losing two members by relying on each other for support.
“I personally have been in touch with the family members and we have spoken to the Chinese Consulate, and we will continue to work with the family and the consulate to ensure that we provide all the support that is necessary,” Suite said. “I know that we are here to share pain but to also show love and remember Ying and Ming, who have touched us with their lives.”
Xuan Wang, Wu’s roommate, said Wu loved to cook and study.
“She was a very nice girl and very positive,” said Wang, a graduate student studying computer science. “I’m very sad about this.”
USC Counseling Services has already began speaking to students who have been affected by the tragedy, said Ilene Rosenstein, director of USC Student Counseling Services.
“We may all have different responses to such a vile and tragic event,” Rosenstein said. “We may be questioning why and find no reason that would ever justify such a horrific loss.”
Thursday at 5:30 p.m. members of Student Counseling Services will be available to students at the Office of Religious Life.
Was it a car robbery gone wrong? It’s so sad for them to have their lives taken so soon. RIP
