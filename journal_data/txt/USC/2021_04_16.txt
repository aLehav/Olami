When the world went virtual in 2020, Maria Galicia, education and programs coordinator for the USC Fisher Museum of Art, faced the challenge of immersing the community in artistic programs without visiting the museum in person. Turning to her community for inspiration, Galicia noticed that the majority of coronavirus resources were not effectively distributed or communicated to people of color, yet they were the most at-risk population to develop serious effects from the virus. Galicia saw an opportunity to bridge the gap between high-risk groups in Los Angeles and governmental health and safety communications.
“All of the information that I was seeing, [in] the media, Spanish outlets and everything, either [was] bad information, incorrect information or not enough information — or there [was] a lot of [scaring] people instead of really helping them,” Galicia said.
Galicia approached Jose Guadalupe Sanchez III, a graduate student studying fine arts with an emphasis in painting, with the idea to make coronavirus resources accessible to this community through an art project. A Latinx artist himself, Sanchez’s work centers around the question: “How as artists can we make work that, on the one hand, validates the neglected experiences of the people we care about (i.e., through direct positive representation and intervention) and, on the other, be a critical reflection on those structures that created the conditions of making a people socially, politically, economically invisible?” 
Sanchez has a history of working with Latinx community members to provide them with essential information through mediums such as paintings, videos and zines, among others. His recent work with a zine on homelessness in the Los Angeles community prompted him to suggest a zine for the art project, eliminating the complex jargon of most government-issued health pamphlets. 
Sanchez and Galicia wanted to create work that captured the reality of Latinx and Indigenous people during the pandemic while also resonating with the type of content they would enjoy reading. Galicia had the idea to partner with Art Division, a nonprofit organization in the Rampart District that aims to support young artists from the ages of 18 to 26. Sanchez and seven student artists from Art Division created loteria cards, colorful graphic cards and comic-like announcements, making for a uniquely fun coronavirus community zine, available in both English and Spanish.
“We wanted to create something colorful, something that resonated with families and people and put a face [to] the struggle of being a working class person,” Vanessa Melesio, one of the Art Division artists on the project, said. “And I think it did resonate with some people, like, they were happy to see brown people that look just like them.”
Melesio has been at Art Division for a year and three months, and was originally drawn to the project because of the sense of community she was craving during the pandemic and the indigenous artists involved in the project.
“We were [just] talking, as also Latinx people, about what the pandemic looks like for our families and the people in our community because a lot of us actually are essential workers,” Melesio said. “And so there [were] topics about like, who are the essential workers?”
Melesio said the group had candid conversations about their own family dynamics and the concept of masculinity, which is why they decided to make the protagonist a father. 
“He’s essentially a hero if he’s the one taking the initiative to [wear] his mask and be proactive about it, and he’s protecting himself, you know, and his family,” Melesio said.
The 32-page zine would come to feature essential facts about coronavirus symptoms, transmission, recovery and vaccination. It also illuminates best practices for personal protective equipment and engaging in public spaces. The zine presents these facts through the story of a Latino man and his heroic efforts to protect his family and community from the dangers of the illness.
For both Sanchez and Melesio, storyboarding was the best part of the zine-making process. While talks of the project started in May 2020, in June, Art Division hosted in-person, coronavirus-safe workshops for the team in which they determined what the storyline was, who the main characters were and what the illustrations were going to look like.
“As a group, we all kind of related to, ‘Like OK, so my tia [aunt], or my dad, or my mom, or my uncle or my brothers, they act and do [things] in relationship to COVID. So we tried to get an understanding of, ‘So how are people from this type of community base that we’re trying to speak to, how do they interact with some of the information that’s being given?’” Sanchez said.
About 1,000 copies of “COVID-19 Community Heroes” and “’Héroes de la Comunidad” were printed and distributed to nonprofit organizations around the MacArthur Park and Westlake areas. Art Division was also able to develop a partnership with Outfront Media to set up bus shelter posters on Wilshire Boulevard, South Park View Street and Colorado Street with illustrations from the zine.
“I think it was a really beautiful example of how people just like ourselves can participate in the world, [in] this particular way that doesn’t always need to happen through these kinds of highly regulated processes,” Sanchez said with regard to the Outfront partnership.
Since 2017, Sanchez has been working with experts in complex topics to simplify information for the communities that need it most and he does not see this project slowing down. He plans to continue his efforts in social engagement practices, with the ultimate goal of translating complex information into visual mediums to act as a resource for varying communities, beyond just information about the pandemic.

Ele.[Mental] fest is this Friday. It’s completely student-run and it’s for a good cause.
Five USC students brought this virtual concert to life to raise funds for The Trevor Project, a nonprofit organization that provides crisis intervention and suicide prevention services to the LGBTQ+ community. 
The virtual festival will feature performances from four electronic music artists. The lineup consists of Silky Smooth, DJ CJ, DJ Mocha Therapy and Cool. Cool. Cool. Tickets are being sold with a “pay what you can” price model. The minimum is $3, but attendees can price their ticket as high as they would like. 
Samantha Berger, a senior majoring in acting, is one of the five students that worked to create a production team called EVM Productions that will bring this concert together. Berger was in charge of marketing, social media and figuring out which charity the proceeds of the concert would go to. 
“We chose this specific charity because they are one of the world’s leading mental health charities, especially for the LGBTQ+ plus communities and youth communities,” Berger said. 
The festival’s purpose to raise funds for an organization that focuses on mental health issues ties in directly with the name of the event. Berger said that each artist is going to represent a different element of electronic dance music hence the name Ele.[Mental]. She said that some of the sets will focus on more melodic music while others will lean more into the rave scene of EDM.
“Our mission statement is a celebration of life for mental health charities,” Berger said. “We’re celebrating our lives, we’re celebrating our health, we’re watching this virtually, we wish we can be in person, but we’re watching it from the comfort of our own homes.”
Organizing this event was no easy task. Funding an event such as this is already difficult without being in a global pandemic, but the team was able to get the job done. Nick Gockel, a senior majoring in business administration, was instrumental in bringing this project together. 
“The analogy, I’ll say that made it a lot easier in my mind to achieve it was, imagine just throwing a virtual birthday party event,” Gockel said. “You have a cake setup, you get some entertainment of some sort, and you just get people to come.”
His duties involved reaching out to artists and making sure that their sets were recorded efficiently. Gockel said he has also made trailers advertising the event and made sure that artists are promoting it. Recently, he said he has been reaching out to people in order to get them to buy tickets. 
“We’re at $2,800 raised, I still have my entire friend group I need to tap into as well as a bunch of my other friend groups,” Gockel said. “We’re going to generate probably $3,500 in revenue, which is completely exceeding the goals that I ever thought.” 
In order to fund the event, the team had to rely on donors as well as sponsors. Some of their lead donors have been family and friends Berger said. Their corporate sponsors though include some very big companies including Coca-Cola, AT&T and Google.
Now that everything has been set up, the team is gearing up for the actual event, which will be live streamed through Moment House, an exclusive digital live experience platform that was founded by USC students in 2019. The platform has hosted shows for artists such as Justin Bieber, Halsey and Kaytranada. 
“No help from anyone else, it is all student-run, all student-made, all student-performed, all student-marketed,” Berger said. “I feel proud of us because we accomplished a lot and the end result hopefully fingers crossed will be amazing.”
Ele.[Mental] fest will take place Friday from 5 p.m. to 8 p.m. Tickets can be purchased here.

On April 6, Gov. Gavin Newsom announced that if certain conditions are met — including a significant decrease of the coronavirus case count and an increase in the number of vaccinated individuals — California’s multi-tiered system (the so-called Blueprint for a Safer Economy color system) will end June 15. This would trigger a full reopening of the state, including many of our entertainment venues here in Los Angeles.
Among the list of businesses set to reopen are movie theaters. Though some of L.A.’s theaters have reopened recently at 25% capacity, the news of the possibility of a full, widespread reopening across the state has incited L.A.’s production companies to resume full-scale filming. For example, Warner Bros.’ film “Godzilla Vs. Kong” was released on March 31 and has far delivered the biggest Hollywood box-office opening during the pandemic, grossing $123.1 million. Such a successful production, however, requires a successful reopening strategy.
Warner  Bros. actor Julia Conoscenti, a junior majoring in journalism, describes the coronavirus precautions and restrictions as strict, explaining that the restrictions are universal: If one person on any Warner Bros. set tests positive for coronavirus, all of the sets on the lot are closed until everyone tests negative again.
These strict coronavirus precautions consequently affect every film on every production lot, rather than affecting individual productions, making it very difficult to film monetarily successful productions during the pandemic. Conoscenti explains that “if something happens with another production, that puts everyone else behind, and then [productions] lose lots of money” during set closures.
“It’s very stressful,” Conoscenti said. “You can tell that everyone [on set] has been more stressed than usual because you have all these new rules now that you didn’t have before.”
Filming on location, as Warner Bros. productions frequently do, carries even more difficulty. Conoscenti explained that coronavirus precautions and restrictions vary by location and failure to align with such restrictions can result in a production being shut down, either by the production company or by L.A. County.
These guidelines, however, are one of the only things keeping L.A.’s film industry afloat during this pandemic. Waiting for actors to test negative for coronavirus, production companies such as Warner Bros. stand to lose tons of money.
Aside from strict guidelines, the other maybe more significant danger of losing money comes from the recent expansion of the streaming industry.
Though production companies lose box-office money when films aren’t shown in brick-and-mortar theaters, the money they have made from streaming platforms has allowed them to continue to succeed during the pandemic. In addition, as Conoscenti describes, the expansion of the streaming industry has allowed production companies to take more “creative risk” in their films. 
And when you think about it, the rising importance of streaming platforms within the entertainment market makes a lot of sense. I, for one, turned to streaming platforms such as Netflix and our USC-provided HBO Max when the coronavirus pandemic incited our very first lockdown in March 2020, and I haven’t switched back.
It’s much easier, it seems, to watch the most recently released movies from the comfort of your own home, where snacks and bathroom breaks only take a quick pause and a few steps. The future of the film industry, however, relies on our eventual return to the brick-and-mortar movie theater.
Once your local movie theater safely reopens, I encourage you to take a trip down memory lane (not that far of a journey — just to pre-coronavirus) and watch a film in sticky seats in a room with strangers once again. If we all do (coronavirus-consciously, of course), there might be brick-and-mortar movie theaters left for the next generation.

USC alumnus Sandy Reed’s mother Catharine Reed, the vice president of Charitable Programs at H.N. and Frances C. Berger Foundation and the School of Dramatic Arts recently created the Sandy Reed Endowed Professional Development Fund in honor of his memory. 
It was a Friday in November 2014, right after the first Chekov class of the fall semester, when Sandy emailed Mary Joan Negro, associate professor of theater practice at the School of Dramatic Arts. In his email, Sandy expressed his excitement about Chekov’s dimensional characters, such as Astrov.
“I really want to grow older and have great compassion for the world just as Astrov does. I think we all have it when we are young but lose it as we get older,” Sandy wrote in the email. 
Sandy died in an accident last June, but he was the one who initiated this fund a few years ago. SDA received $250,000 from family foundations to provide opportunities and support to students at the beginning of their artistic careers.  
Sandy laid the foundation for this endowment right after he graduated from USC and told his mother that he wanted to help current SDA students and alumni. 
“He was so philanthropic in his heart,” Catharine said. “A super big heart, probably the best friend anybody ever had.” 
Sandy began working more actively on the professional fund during the pandemic. He aimed to help people who needed transportation, headshots, networking, mentoring and other startup tools that would support their careers. 
“There was an energy of generosity, of exuberance, of joy, of sometimes just that passionate eagerness to ‘I can’t get it, I want to get it,’” Negro said.
Sandy was born in 1994 in Glendora, Calif. and grew up in Palm Springs with his mother, his sister Katie Reed, who was his “soundboard and best friend,” and his cat Jack, his mother said. He always wanted to be an actor, and he would dress up his cat for all of his home skits. There was no backup plan, his mother said. As a child, he would always sing and dance, and he performed at a community theater up until he went to college. 
Sandy was accepted to both USC schools of Dramatic Arts and Cinematic Arts and enhanced his path as an actor with summer programs. Between his freshman and sophomore year, he went to Rada in London and acted in productions by playwrights such as William Shakespeare. As he was about to enter his senior year, he studied acting at Stella Adler in New York, his mother said. 
“New York. New York. NEW YORK! This place seems unreal for the fact that I can walk to three parks within two miles of me,” Sandy wrote in an email to Negro on June 23, 2015. “When passing others, I still look at people in the eyes, still smile, or still exchange a simple, ‘hi’. It is okay if it is not returned but when it is there is a warmness that is felt and it makes me feel great. I’m happy. That is all that counts.”
Sandy also appeared in musicals and theatrical plays while at USC, such as “You Can’t Take it With You” and “Into the Woods.” During the spring musical “Most Happy Fella” and at one of the rehearsals, Sandy walked up to USC alumna Adrienne Visnic,  one of the leads in the play, and told her they were going to be friends. 
“Truly, I can say that that’s like one of the biggest blessings I’ve ever had in my life, just being part of [Sandy’s] world,” Visnic said. “There’s really not one single word to describe him … they say, ‘People light up a room, and they walk in,’ and he was exactly that, maybe even a little bit more. He led with his curiosity; he cared about his community.” 
Sandy also studied voice speech into dialects with Associate Professor of voice and movement studies Kathleen Dunn-Muzingo. Dunn-Muzingo said that even though she coached him in a couple of USC plays, he still kept in touch after he graduated and also helped him with auditions. 
“[Sandy] was just an exceptional artist and human being, and appreciated what he learned at USC and wanted to pay it forward to the students that graduated, knowing that actors, after exiting the program, feel a sense of loss,” Dunn-Muzingo said.
Sandy went on a journey to Europe right after he graduated for about six weeks, where he created the documentary “This is for You, Older Sandy.” It was picked up and showcased at the Palm Springs Festival, his mother said. 
After Sandy returned from his trip to Europe, he lived in North Hollywood and worked as a waiter as he pursued an acting career. Although he made an appearance in “Doctor Dolittle” and was featured in CPP productions of “Pinocchio,” “Cinderella,” “The Wizard of Oz,” “Beauty and the Beast” and more, according to his obituary, Sandy struggled to get the roles he wanted, his mother said. 
Determined to live his dream, Sandy moved to Atlanta, where he found more work as an actor. 
“I MOVED!!! It happened,” Sandy wrote in an email on Feb. 3, 2019, to Negro. “It’s challenging. I know no one. And it’s a chance to develop new habits. Create a deeper understanding of acting and myself. And altogether to find a deeper place within my heart for self-love.”   
Nearly a year later, in March 2020, the coronavirus pandemic hit the nation, and Sandy decided to move back home to Palm Springs, where he would spend more time with his family. 
Following his death that summer, besides family and friends, Sandy left behind his acting career with a recent Popeyes commercial and an upcoming short film “Forgive Us,” as well as the Sandy Reed Professional Endowment fund. The fund today is ready to begin supporting upcoming artists with more professional development opportunities, such as casting workshops, alumni mentorship programs and networking events, USC director of development Kim Muhlbach said.  
“[Sandy] was like a magnetic, passionate, kind, loving student,” Muhlbach said. “He was a really well-known student among the student population, just because he was just so engaged in the community and also so charismatic and kind and loving.”  
For the future, this fund will help professional development programming each year at SDA. Many students and young alumni will be able to benefit from this fund, and as an endowment, is meant to live forever, Muhlbach said.  
“I’ll leave you with this,” Sandy wrote in an email to Negro on Feb. 3, 2019. “This is a quote from a Georgian artist, who was part of an art project for the Super Bowl showcasing civil issues and successes from Atlanta leaders: 
‘Art is the heartbeat to humanity. There is no socioeconomic divide in art. All is equal.’”

With the recent rise in hate crimes against Asians and Asian Americans, Yi-Ann Li found that now, more than ever, is an important time to advocate for the Asian community. So when Li, a freshman majoring in psychology, heard about a new opportunity for advocacy with the Intercollegiate APIDA Coalition, she knew she wanted to get involved.
The ICAC consists of college Asian Pacific Islander Desi American student groups across the country aiming to fight against anti-Asian racism and the rise in violence directed at Asian communities. As USC’s representative to the coalition, Li brings her perspective on what USC could do to better support the Asian community and compares this to actions taken at other universities. The coalition’s discussions ultimately contribute to the “overarching perspective” on what universities can do to better support their Asian and Asian American students, Li said. 
“I felt like joining this coalition was a really good way to spread the word and educate people … on the importance of advocating for the Asian community, on the importance of learning about what’s happening and learning about how this spike in Asian hate is not a new thing that started just last year,” Li said.
The coalition formed in early March after Kobi Khong, a freshman at Johns Hopkins University, reached out to APIDA student organizations on college campuses around the country to come together in response to the rise in Asian hate.
“What we coalesced around was this idea of what is happening in the news [and] what you’re seeing on social media,” said Abigail Jiang, a sophomore at the California Institute of Technology majoring in material science. “Our goal so far has been to address these incidents on our campuses, through our campuses, [by] talking to administration and trying to do collaborative work.”
One way the ICAC has worked to achieve their goal is by releasing a statement of specified demands directed towards universities to fight against Asian hate.
Kesavan Srivilliputhur, a sophomore at Princeton University majoring in chemistry who co-led the writing of the statement, said that there was tension during the process of writing, as a range of progressive political views were represented and many organizations weren’t allowed to endorse anything partisan. 
“We focused our demands on universities because that also helped us keep away from more national politics and partisanship,” Srivilliputhur said. 
Demands include calling for universities to release a statement condemning the violence and racism against Asians and Asian Americans, offer Asian American studies courses and ethnic studies programs, disaggregate data of the Asian student population by ethnicity and hire culturally competent mental health professionals.
Currently, the ICAC is holding a fundraiser for Asian Americans Advancing Justice (AAJC), an agency with the mission to advance civil and human rights for Asian Americans. So far, the fundraiser has raised almost $4,000 towards its goal of $20,000.
“[We picked AAJC] because AAJC has had a really solid history of directly helping communities in terms of legal advocacy for immigration rights,” Jiang said.
Another main reason the coalition chose AAJC was as a result of the organization’s response to the mid-March racially motivated shootings in Atlanta. Jiang said she saw all the work being done by AAJC sub-chapters, both inside and outside of Atlanta, to support the community. 
While the ICAC formed in response to negative events, it also showed how well the Asian American community could come together, said Srivilliputhur. 
“I would have never met these people if we did not all have this drive to come together to fight back against white supremacy and against Asian hate,” he said. 
For Li, who also advocates for the Asian and Asian American community at USC as a president of Dear Asian Youth, a nonprofit organization dedicated to empowering the narratives of the Asian youth, and an intern for the Asian Pacific American Student Assembly, her involvement with the ICAC and working alongside other students was “very humbling.” 
“I personally have met a lot of burdens and obstacles with trying to, as an individual, educate everyone around me because it gets exhausting … so I feel like there’s strength in numbers,” Li said. “I feel like it’s about time for the Asian community to really demand to be heard.”
Correction: A previous version of this article misstated Kesavan Srivilliputhur’s name as Kesavan Srivilliputhu. The Daily Trojan regrets this error.

LeBron James carries a certain aura of invincibility. Yes, he can be beaten, but his body has seemed indestructible since the moment he stepped foot onto an NBA court. In his first nine seasons, he missed just 32 regular season games — a mere 3.6 games per season. Very rarely do we see “The King” with a dent in his armor, giving him a legitimate case to be crowned the most durable basketball player (and maybe even athlete) we’ve ever seen.  
However, with 17 seasons behind him, games and minutes piling up, the 36-year-old suffered a high-right ankle sprain that has kept him out of action since March 20. James, who preaches availability as one of his greatest attributes, sent out a tweet after hearing he would miss over a month of Lakers games. He wrote, “Nothing angers and saddens me more than not being available to and for my teammates.” 
James’ durability is obviously one of his best traits, but it has created a sense of “LeBron-dependency” among players and coaches for teams he’s played on. Naturally, James is usually ready to lace up come game time. There is no backup plan because there is rarely a need for one. Luckily, James has never faced a major injury in the postseason and has yet to miss a playoff game in his career. 
Having LeBron on the court is like having another coach on the floor at all times. James will point players to where they should position themselves and when they should move to the other side of the court, getting his team into their sets. Or, he might just get down in the post, hold the ball high above his head, and survey the opposing defense — telling his teammates when to cut or screen to generate easy baskets. 
Because James has the ability to see the game at a different level than the rest, his teams are at their best when he commands the ball a majority of the time. While we credit the 17-time All Star for his durability, we must point out his lack of malleability. Unlike Kevin Durant or Stephen Curry, who you can simply plug into any team and fit right into the game plan, James needs to be the team’s engine. And when you take that engine out, it’s not so pretty. 
In James’ second stint with the Cavaliers, his teammates and coaching staff developed a severe case of “LeBron-dependency.” They never really figured out how to win without their superstar, posting a dismal 4-23 record over four seasons when James was sidelined. 
It was a similar story during James’ first year in Los Angeles under head coach Luke Walton, as the Lakers finished with a 9-18 record while James missed time with a groin injury. In his second season with the Lakers, James missed just four games, with the Lakers falling short in two of those games. 
After losing James on top of losing power forward Anthony Davis, it would not have been a surprise to see the fourth-seeded Lakers fall to the middle of the standings and become a candidate for the play-in tournament. Without James, head coach Frank Vogel loses his engine, but with no Anthony Davis, the wheels come off too. 
So how have the Lakers managed to sustain a 6-8 record without their two-headed monster? How have they managed to stay afloat on a ship without its sails?
It starts and ends with Vogel. He has the ability to put a defensive juggernaut on the floor regardless of the available personnel. Pre-injury, LeBron was defending at an All-Defensive team level, playing the “free safety” role to perfection on the back line. Davis was deterring shots at the rim while hounding opponents with his 7-foot-6-inch wingspan. Vogel has transformed the identity of this Lakers team into a hard-nosed, scrappy defensive team that will contest every jump shot, meet anyone at the rim and dig into opponents to make each trip down the court a living nightmare.
Since James’ ankle injury, the Lakers have maintained the second-best defensive rating in the league without their two best defenders. Vogel has kept his squad in the hunt for home court in the first round of the playoffs, just a game behind the fourth-seeded Nuggets. With James’ and Davis’ returns on the horizon, it could have been a lot worse for the Lakers; this 6-8 stretch, including a 4-3 road trip, will be forgotten when the calendar hits June, but avoiding the free fall down the Western Conference will be critical when playoff seeding is decided. 
Vogel has been under-appreciated throughout his career, but he deserves a huge chunk of the credit for this Lakers season. Every night, he and his coaching staff put together a stout defensive game plan that suffocates opponents. Vogel has proved to be the best defensive coach in the Association and should be considered for the Coach of the Year award.

USC will return to the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum, five months after its Pac-12 title game loss to Oregon, for its annual Spring Showcase. The showcase is open to 5,000 fans and family members of players and coaches, and it is the only USC Athletics event currently open to the general public.
The showcase will feature four 12-minute quarters with the roster divided into Cardinal and Gold teams. USC will come in with eight practices under its belt so far, and according to recently promoted tight end coach Seth Doege, the showcase will serve as an opportunity to see how players perform in game-like situations. 
“When the bullets fly, it’s a lot,” Doege said. “It’s a lot harder than it is drawing it on the whiteboard which they’ve been doing the last eight weeks before spring ball started, and so they’ll continue to make huge steps.”
Even with an exciting slate of newcomers, impressive enough to be ranked the No. 8 recruiting class in the country, the Trojans come into 2021 with an experienced group. Sixteen of last season’s 22 starters will take the field in Cardinal and Gold again, including a potential Heisman Trophy candidate, junior quarterback Kedon Slovis.
Slovis led the Trojans to the No. 11 passing offense in yards per game during their shortened 5-0 regular season in 2020. The quarterback has matured in the air-raid offense, now entering his third year in the system and under the leadership of offensive coordinator Graham Harrell. 
While Slovis led the Trojans down the field with impressive accuracy last season, the run game ultimately failed to produce. The lack of an established run game was a worrying trend that was only amplified in the Pac-12 Championship when the Trojans finished with only 38 rushing yards. Redshirt senior running backs Vavae Malepeai and Stephen Carr return, but the team’s attitude on their role in the offense has shifted according to Doege.
“[Head coach Clay Helton] changed some verbiage in the run game,” Doege said. “So we got to do a good job of being on the same page from a communication standpoint.”
On the defensive end, defensive coordinator Todd Orlando comes into this season after setting a new standard for USC’s defensive unit seldom seen over the past decade. The Trojans allowed only 369.7 total yards per game on the season, its second-fewest since 2009. Redshirt senior defensive lineman Nick Figueroa, who led the Trojans in tackles and sacks in 2020, will likely be out for Saturday’s showcase while recovering from shoulder surgery. 
Other defensive starters, including junior outside linebacker Drake Jackson and sophomore lineman Tuli Tuipulotu return as leaders and potential mentors to incoming freshman defensive lineman and No. 1 overall recruit Korey Foreman as well as freshman outside linebacker Raesjon Davis.
Saturday’s squad includes players who will graduate this spring, These players got a second chance to complete their playing careers under a NCAA rule extending eligibility to athletes affected by seasons cut short due to the coronavirus. Fourteen seniors in total will be classified as second-year seniors, including inside linebacker Kana’i Mauga and senior tight end Erik Krommenhoek.
“I know how special this place is,” Krommenhoek said. “I know how special the tradition is here. I know how special the town of kids we have here is and, just, this ceiling that we have that I know we want to reach, and I think we can, and I wanted to be a part of that.”
While Saturday’s showcase will be exciting for the fans who’ve been itching to see their team in action, Doege emphasized the team’s focus on skills growth over the course of spring workouts. 
“We do not care about immediate results,” Doege said. “We want to create habits that will sustain long term success when we come, when we play Notre Dame.” 
The Trojans’ Spring Showcase kicks off at 1 p.m Saturday. It will air on the Pac-12 Network.

The No. 1 women’s water polo team is gearing up for Senior Day and two matchups against No. 5 Arizona State this weekend. The games will be the Trojans’ last home tilts before heading to Westwood to face UCLA next weekend. 
Earlier in the season, the Trojans met the Sun Devils in the 2021 ASU Invitational — winning their first game 16-8 and edging out a narrow 6-5 win the following day. 
Missing from those early games was ASU sophomore defender Lara Kiss, a critical player in the Sun Devils’ upset win over No. 2 UCLA last weekend. Kiss found an early goal for the Sun Devils in the first quarter and recorded three steals overall. 
ASU freshman attacker Luca Petovary, just awarded MPSF/KAP 7 Newcomer of the Week honors, will also be on the Trojans’ radar — her five goals in two games against UCLA won her a spot on the ASU all-time records for freshman scorers. That’s without mentioning Petovary is also leading the team with 38 goals on the season. 
But another 38-goal tallied player will be present for the two-game series — USC redshirt senior driver Denise Mammolito. The newly minted MPSF Player of the Week backed up her previous strong contributions to the team with seven goals in wins over No. 2 Stanford this past weekend. 
“It’s just [Mammolito] playing on both ends, and you know, going to push, ‘I’m going to be brave, you know, to step into the right place at the right time,’” head coach Marko Pintaric said of Mammolito’s performance against the Cardinal. “Then again, you have to give credit to her teammates as well, to find her … and it was just a great, great, great team effort, but her, just constantly working hard and being in the right place at the right time, she did carry the team this weekend, definitely.”
When celebrating Senior Day, Mammolito will be joined by other upperclassmen threats in senior driver Verica Bakoc, redshirt senior and soon-to-be Olympian Maud Megens and junior driver Grace Tehaney. With their work, combined with 10 other Trojans who have scored this season, USC has recorded 13.1 goals per game. 
The offensive effort will be tested by ASU’s defenders, including senior goalie/utility Chelsea Karimazondo, whose combined experience in the cage and in the field has earned her an average of 8.4 saves per game and an average 7.2 goals allowed for competitors. 
On the other end of the pool, redshirt senior goalie Holly Parker has set the energy for the Trojans in every single match they’ve had. Parker just outdoes Karimazondo in averaging 8.5 saves per game and matches the 7.2 goals allowed average, but recently posted two games with 12 saves each, career highs for the All-American. With a defense that has helped keep opponents without a score in seven total periods this season, the Trojans can work within their hard press to keep the Sun Devils at bay. 
Both teams will be battling fatigue after returning for yet another two-game weekend series against top-three opponents.
“Arizona is a great team this year, you know, they have played pretty much in every position and they play a little bit different than Stanford, you know, in terms of ratio zone to press,” Pintaric said. “It’s a different game, and you know, we already played them twice so we’re kind of fortunate to already have a good look at them.”
USC has a slight advantage having not traveled for several weeks, and the positive energy that’ll come from celebrating eight players for Senior Day should surely give the Trojans an added edge. In a recent announcement, Los Angeles County approved the allowance of limited family and guests of student-athletes and coaches to attend the remaining outdoor spring home games. 
The Trojans will face ASU on Saturday at noon and Sunday at 11 a.m., honoring the team’s seniors before Sunday’s matchup.

I came to the United States knowing only one language. Before I could ever read and write in English, I spoke Tagalog. 
It’s a beautiful island language, a blend of the native dialects with characteristics of the Spanish due to their time as colonial rulers of the archipelago. The language is part of the culture, and it runs deep within my history. 
To me, Tagalog is evocative of Nochebuena late-night dinners, early morning runs to the bread shop for pandesal and Pilipino romantic comedies. It is the language of my childhood, and for so many years, I was unable to appreciate the depth of its meaning to me. 
When I came to the United States, language became the very first hurdle in my education and socialization. English was a great, intimidating facet of American society, and, for many like me, it was not the primary language spoken at home. 
I was in classes designed for those learning English as a Second Language (ESL) from the very beginning, and while I am grateful to have learned what I did, the experience and the narrowness of the U.S. educational curriculum suggested to me that there was something inferior about my native language and native culture.  
At an age where fitting in is paramount, to be cordoned off from regular classes and expected to learn English as a requirement to return to the masses is not only a monumental ask from young children, but also a psychological and social stressor that implies that there is something wrong with what they know.  
For a while, I was stubbornly resentful. It’s one of the great ironies of my life that I started out despising English with a passion. Because of the sharp criticism I received from teachers or peers, it was easier to keep to myself and avoid much use of the language altogether. 
I was painfully aware of how thick my accent was and how I alone encountered the difficulties of code switching in my early years. In a predominantly Caucasian community, there were rarely kids in similar situations. It felt isolating, whether that was the intention or not. There were more than a few occasions of unavoidable frustration when I couldn’t produce the English translation of a Tagalog word.
Up until third grade, reading and writing in English were distinct reminders of my otherness. It may not make sense to the outside world, but it’s a common coping mechanism for others like me to push that otherness down and suppress it.
Speaking only in Tagalog turned into speaking occasionally in Tagalog, which lent itself to speaking rarely in Tagalog. It was unconscious but reactive, and if there is any pressing harm in giving children only one avenue to learn by, it is the complete supplantation of personal heritage for educational uniformity. 
Education consultant Rusul Alrubail wrote about this phenomenon in an article in The Atlantic: “Banning [a child’s] first language often creates a negative impact … a sense of divide for students between their first language, often used at home, and English. We see students who refuse to be associated with their first language, or refuse to speak it or acknowledge that they know it, due to them feeling ashamed … This impacts their cultural identity.”
Education, as an opportunity to be inclusive of cultural wealth, is not inclusive in the modern age and conversely suggests to students that there is a scale that finds their native language inferior to American English. 
There is a part of me that will always regret letting my bilingual fluency go. It’s not as if I couldn’t earn back the fluidity and ease of speaking Tagalog, but the difficulty will be in unearthing the things I put away long ago. 
It wasn’t until I was in high school that I was given the option to study another language, and my native language wasn’t even offered in the curriculum. 
From a perspective that reviews the possibility of utilizing foreign language as a national resource, Olga Kagan, a professor of Slavic languages at the University of California, Los Angeles, argues that there is harm in essentially banning the use of more than one language in school. Her suggestion for American education encouraged the creation of classes designed to solidify reading and writing fluency in foreign language for “heritage speakers” like myself. 
In California, 44% of citizens speak a second language at home. In Los Angeles, that number climbs to 57%. 
The opportunities to enhance the knowledge and capacity of the general population are limitless when we view foreign languages as an asset, not as a tactic for division and “othering.” 
It encourages, too, the wellbeing of our nation’s children and young adults. 
From a teaching standpoint and from a position to advise our university systems, Alrubail emphasizes the importance of unlinking expectations of assimilation and English language learning. One can learn a language without foregoing their heritage; teaching children only in English wrongly impresses the notion that they are connected. 
There are other avenues for educating our youth. As our community makeup and our USC population grows increasingly more diverse, inclusivity should be the focus of our educational institutions. Instead of taking heritage away from the younger generations, we should be embracing their language capabilities and enhancing them alongside the staple of American English. It is possible to do both, just as it is possible to embrace two cultures.

Recently I took a coronavirus test at one of USC’s testing sites, and after dropping off my saliva sample, I was offered a button “to spread awareness and prevention around sexual assault.” Suffice it to say, a button will not assist in the plight to combat the systemic problem of sexual assault on college campuses.
According to the Rape, Abuse & Incest National Network, 26.4% of undergraduate women, 6.8% of undergraduate men and 23.1% of transgender, genderqueer or gender nonconforming students experience rape or sexual assault. College women are twice as likely to be sexually assaulted than robbed, a ratio disproportionate to that of all women. 
Year after year, students and the public are bombarded with alarming statistics about the prevalence of campus assault. Yet, the solutions proposed by our institutions remain a far cry from offering tangible, meaningful change.  
Veiled behind performative emails, marketing campaigns and buttons seeking to call out sexual violence, USC consistently misses the mark on protecting its students and holding perpetrators accountable. 
To begin with, the University fails to provide adequate networks that support survivors. The Relationship and Sexual Violence Prevention Service (RSVP) office on campus remains inaccessible to students, with the USC Sexual Assault & Survivor Support website offering a phone number that takes you to the Student Health mainline. If a student is seeking emergency assistance, they must wait for a series of extensions and transfers until reaching the RSVP office. 
After ongoing attempts by students to engage the University in offering this service, rape kits are unavailable on USC’s campus. The nearest location is eight miles away, and the University states that they do not have their own sexual assault response team/center as these programs must demonstrate “specific requirements approved by the County of Los Angeles.” Whether or not it remains the jurisdiction of the county, the University fails to make its interest towards establishing one of these centers on campus readily available. 
Additionally, it remains highly uncertain where the University stands on holding perpetrators accountable. 
In Spring 2020, a Google document circulated the Greek community, which compiled the faces and names of alleged perpetrators of assault involved in Greek life, gathered from an anonymous Google form. According to the document, a number of the accused crimes had been made known to the chapters where the perpetrators were members, and yet the accused not only remained active members in Greek life but also kept their status as USC students. 
The intention of the document was not to report students but rather provide others with the known faces and names of potential abusers for their own safety. 
While it is distressing to hear that such a document had to be developed in the first place, it is clear that its circulation was symptomatic of a community’s failure to demonstrate adequate action around the matter. 
Campus sexual assault is severly underreported, with only 20% of female student victims choosing to report to law enforcement. In 2019, only 43 rape and 86 sex offenses on University Park Campus in total were reported to the University. These statistics, paired with the presence of a Google document providing the names of perpetrators, suggest that reporting may not be in the interest of students since it is widely affirmed and perceived that our institutions will not actually take action or support survivors and that it is the responsibility of students themselves to ensure that they are safe. 
Students have also taken to proposing policies that may prevent assault on campus to remedy the dismal preventative action taken by the administration. This past spring, Alexandra Gill, a USG presidential candidate, ran a campaign on student safety advocating for students to be allowed to arm themselves with tasers or pepper spray on campus. 
While well intentioned in her platform, Gill’s proposals highlighted the problematic nature of students’ choice to take protection into their own hands. Rather than demanding the University amend its existing policies around sexual assault prevention, Gill assumed the role of adjusting and accomodating to an otherwise sick system. It suggests that complex dynamics of power and force must win out, rather than seeking to address the issues at the core of sexual assault and violence. 
Sexual assault — like all other forms of physical violence and abuse — remain deeply interwoven in issues of power, agency, exploitation and privilege. Combating the problem, raising awareness and taking preventative measures, is not found through use of the same tools that challenge the aggressor with force or with preparing the next victim with knowledge beforehand, as was done with the Greek life Google document. It is not found through emails; it is not found through passive online courses. It is also not found through buttons given out at coronavirus testing sites. 
It is found through the necessary dismantlement and improvement of systems that allow abuse to happen in the first place. This begins when the institutions responsible for perpetuating violence look within themselves to deconstruct the multifaceted ways they allow perpetrators to remain protected and safe while simultaneously denying victims a truly adequate chance at recovery with inaccessible systems and a credible chance that their story will be heard and believed. 
A cultural, political and social shift, in which students know that aggression and harm done onto others will not be tolerated and that survivors’ stories will be championed and understood by the institutions they call home, is one place to begin to remedy this problem.
