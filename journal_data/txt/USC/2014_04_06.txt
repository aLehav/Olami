An informal student committee, which included members of Program Board’s Queer and Ally Student Assembly and Undergraduate Student Government, launched a petition on Thursday night urging that USC housing — both on and off campus — be expanded to include gender-neutral housing options.
USC students have been advocating for gender-neutral housing at USC since at least 2011, when QuASA member organization Trojans for Equality drafted a proposal for gender-neutral housing. When the proposal was submitted to Residential Education, however, ResEd deemed it unnecessary for the university at the time, and it was retracted.
Since that proposal, research and advocacy regarding gender-neutral housing at USC has increased exponentially.
In October 2011, USG Director of Diversity Affairs Josh DeMilta conducted an online survey regarding student opinions on gender-inclusive housing. The survey responses suggested that almost 80 percent of the 530 student participants would be supportive of a pilot program allowing students of opposite genders to live together.
It wasn’t until March 2012, however, that the USG Senate passed a resolution proposing a pilot program for gender-inclusive housing on the Rainbow Floor, a special interest community for LGBT students and allies in Century Apartments.
The pilot program, launched in fall 2012, designated two apartments on the Rainbow Floor as                                                                              gender-inclusive. According to university policy, roommates were still required to be the same gender, but the gender-inclusive apartments could house two legally male-identifying students in one bedroom and two legally female-identifying students in the other bedroom.
This year, the pilot program expanded to allow all Rainbow Floor residents (excluding first-year students) to live in gender-inclusive apartments.
“[The pilot program] is getting there, but what we need is a process that allows people to not disclose their identities because there are students who are not binary-identified,” said Alyssa Coffey, who will serve as the 2014-2015 QuASA executive director.
The reason the pilot program, with gender-inclusive housing options, still seems limiting to some students is because it still doesn’t offer a truly gender-neutral option.
“The distinction [between      gender-inclusive and gender-neutral] is very slight but very important,” said Quyen Nguyen-Le, co-president of Queer People of Color.
Gender-inclusive housing still requires gender identity to be considered in the roommate matching process, and roommates in the same bedroom must still have the same legal gender identity — male or female. This option is inclusive only in that apartment-mates living in different bedrooms can be of the opposite gender.
Gender-neutral housing, on the other hand, does not consider gender when matching roommates. Instead, students of any gender identity can live in the same bedroom with students of any other gender identity.
On April 15, the committee of students advocating for gender-neutral housing options will present their resolution to the USG senate. The resolution proposes that by the 2015-2016 academic year, students will be able to opt in to gender-neutral housing in  apartment- or suite-style USC housing facilities.
In addition to this proposal, the students advocating for gender neutral housing are also collaborating with both the Residential Education and Housing departments to logistically work out the details of incorporating gender-neutral housing into the existing USC housing options.
The petition is intended to demonstrate student support for gender-neutral housing both to USG and to USC’s administration.
“[We’re trying to] show the university that this is not a special interest community that wants to get something for themselves,” Coffey said. “It’s something that the student body sees as necessary.”
The petition garnered over 300 signatures within the first 48 hours of being launched.
“I definitely believe that the petition is a great way to get the attention of the students and show the administration that students do care about this issue,” said Dylan Lee, who will serve as the 2014-2015 QuASA assistant director.
Lee also spoke about the benefits that the proposed gender-neutral housing option will have for students.
“[Gender-neutral housing] accommodates all gender identities so that there’s a safe space for anyone who may not identify within a gender binary or is trans or just wants a safe housing option that they can feel comfortable in,” Lee said.
Robby Sachs, a junior majoring in business administration and the current resident advisor on the Rainbow Floor, suggested that the gender-neutral option could directly benefit many students, even beyond the scope of the LGBT community.
“It doesn’t even have to be an LGBT issue,” Sachs said. “[Gender-neutral housing] is just for anyone who’s more comfortable living with someone of the opposite gender, and that’s not allowed unless you go through  non-USC housing.”
Additionally, Nguyen-Le noted that the expansion of current USC housing options to include a                     gender-neutral option would communicate USC’s dedication to diversity and inclusiveness.
“[Offering gender-neutral housing] would just communicate that USC is an open and inclusive space,” Nguyen-Le said. “And I think that breaking down traditional gender binary stereotypes would benefit all people.”

Students from universities across Southern California gathered at Hoffman Hall in the Marshall School of Business Friday through Sunday to compete in IBM’s Watson Academic case competition.
Case in point · Sam Sharma, a graduate student studying systems architecture and engineering, presents his team’s ideas on Sunday, April 6. – Razan Al Marzouqi | Daily Trojan
Twenty-seven teams, each comprised of four students from USC; University of California, Los Angeles; California State University, Northridge and California State Polytechnic University, Pomona, were introduced to IBM’s Watson Engagement Advisor and were challenged to develop a unique idea for applying the Watson technology to a business or organization.
The Watson technology reads and understands technology in a manner similar to the human brain. The Watson Engagement Advisor is a tool businesses can use to interact with their customers where they would otherwise need to use a trained worker.
Over the first two days of the competition, representatives from IBM gave presentations to the students explaining how the technology works and the different ways it can be implemented. The teams then had until Sunday afternoon to come up with an idea for how the Watson Engagement Advisor could be used in a business, either real or fictitious.
The teams first gave five-minute pitches to a panel of judges consisting of both IBM representatives and USC faculty. The judges chose five finalists to give longer, more detailed presentations later in the day. The winner was announced at an awards ceremony Sunday evening.
Stephen Gold, IBM’s Vice President of Marketing and Sales Operations of Watson Solutions, explained that the competition presented an opportunity for both the students and IBM.
“For the students, it’s a great opportunity prior to them moving into the industry to get exposure for next-generation technology, think about the application of this technology and where in their chosen vocation they can put this to work,” Gold said. “We’re looking forward to hearing how these students envision the technology could take form.”
Sam Sharma, a first-year graduate student majoring in systems architecture and engineering at USC, worked with his team to develop an idea to increase efficiency in a fictitious business called “Leaf,” a nutrition research and consulting company.
Sharma saw the competition as a way to explore other industries and learn more about the potential business applications of technology such as Watson. His team decided to work with a company specializing in healthcare and nutrition to step outside of its comfort zone and try something different.
“IBM is a reputable company, and they brought a product they developed for us to see its real-world applications and to what domains it can be applied,” he said. “I think it’s a good way for all of us to explore new industries and opportunities.”
Sharma’s teammate, Li Xiang, a graduate student studying computer science, joined the competition to learn more about the cutting-edge technology.
“I really wanted to expose new ideas for how to make use of this technology,” Xiang said. “I’m really fond of IBM’s Watson technology. I think it’s going to change the world.”
The results of the competition were not available as of press time.

This Saturday marked the 34th annual “Swim With Mike” charity swim-a-thon at the Uytengsu Aquatics Center on the University Park Campus. The event brought together athletes and individuals from across the university, including members of the swim team, the football team and the Song Girls.
Just keep swimming · Olympian John Naber shakes the hand of a fellow relay participant during the 34th annual Swim with Mike swim-a-thon, which took place at the Uytengsu Aquatics Center on April 5. – Kirstin Louie | Daily Trojan
The organization, which began at USC, aims to provide financial support for athletes who are faced with life-challenging accidents or illnesses and wish to pursue a college education.
Mike Nyeholt, for whom the event is named, graduated from USC in 1978 with a degree in business administration and finance. In 1981, Nyeholt — who achieved All-American status and three NCAA swim team titles during his time at the university — broke his neck in a motorcycle accident.
“A bunch of my friends and family — the guys I used to swim with here at USC — organized an event called Swim for Mike [and] raised a whole bunch of money,” Nyeholt told KTLA. “It was more money than I could use to help me in my recovery, and I said to my good friend Ron Orr, ‘Let’s put this into a scholarship fund and help somebody out.’”
Since its inception, the organization has expanded to offer scholarships to students beyond USC and today reports it represents 141 college scholarships at 68 different schools and has raised more than 14.2 million dollars.
“The scholarship was born, and we didn’t know there was a need, but it turned out we had three in the first year that qualified for our scholarship,” Orr told KTLA. “It’s continued to grow.”
USC Helenes and Trojan Knights volunteered at the event. Some worked at the silent auction while others swam to help raise money for additional scholarships. Ruchie Bhardwaj, a member of the Helenes, said the event raised more than 1 million dollars.
Trojan Knights member Tim Tong, who participated in the belly flop contest after helping set up the event, also said the fundraiser included a record breaking 100 x 100 relay swim where 100 swimmers each swim 100 yards.
Bhardwaj helped check visitors into the event, including prior Swim with Mike scholarship recipients. Bhardwaj said recipients were happy to see the dedication of the USC community as well as the organization’s continued success.
“We wanted to raise as much money as possible for the people who needed it for their scholarships,” Bhardwaj said. “It was my first time and it was really cool, so I’m definitely going to [volunteer] again next year.”

College spring football always comes at the perfect time. As March Madness winds down and with the College Baseball World Series still a few months away, 15 spring practices fill a void for college sports fans. This year at USC, the practices are even more significant as they introduce the Steve Sarkisian era of Trojan football.
This spring has offered the first glimpses of the way Sarkisian will run his practices and, to a large extent, the program as a whole. As the team enters the final third of its allotted practices this spring, Sarkisian has already revealed much about his intentions for the future.
Preaching speed, Sarkisian has put the Trojans through the ringer with practices moving at a blinding pace. The team covers 120 plays per session, which is far greater than the number practiced by last year’s squad. In line with the renewed emphasis on speed is the scheme Sarkisian will be implementing on offense. Sarkisian’s new system will feature a no huddle, up-tempo approach that focuses on the run first.
Defensive coordinator Justin Wilcox is also implementing a new scheme, marking a fresh break from last year’s successful 5-2 front. The Trojan defense will split its time between a 3-4 and a 4-3 with the majority of time spent in the 3-4 base. This will allow the Trojans’ rangy, athletic linebackers to use their speed to make plays in space.
For anyone who follows the football team, none of this comes as a shock. In fact, the results of spring practice so far are consistent with what Sarkisian promised in his introductory press conference. One of the most pleasing aspects of spring practice has been the multitude of surprise players who are flourishing under the Sarkisian regime.
Now, any mention of a breakout player during the spring comes with the invariable caveat that it is still spring practice. That means the squad isn’t fully healthy yet and everyone gets their chance to shine. In past years, some spring stars have disappeared under the bright lights of the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum when fall rolls around.
While it is important to be the cognizant of that fact, it shouldn’t take away from some of the breakout performances thus far. Last year, redshirt junior tailback Javorius “Buck” Allen had an impressive performance in a spring scrimmage that foreshadowed his dynamic 2013 season. One can only wonder, however, if Allen would have become just another flash in the pan had Lane Kiffin stayed and kept Allen buried on the depth chart.
Allen was just one of many highly rated recruits who finally blossomed into phenomenal talents once Kiffin was fired. That transition for Allen and others happened mid-year, without the benefit of an offseason to improve skills and strength. Under the tutelage of Sarkisian and his talented staff, it would not be surprising to see many Kiffin-era recruits make the leap to stardom.
Sarkisian has never had this much talent as his disposal. With all of these weapons in his arsenal, he can exploit match-ups and showcase a variety of players without focusing on one or two guys, which looks to be the plan so far.
On the defensive side, coaches have praised both redshirt sophomore linebacker Scott Starr and redshirt freshman defensive back Chris Hawkins. Both have the natural ability to be big-time players in the fall. More promising than either of those players is the emergence of stalwart junior defensive tackle Antwaun Woods.
Woods, a local product from Taft High School in Woodland Hills, Calif., contributed significantly in both his freshman and sophomore seasons. It looks like he has elevated his game to an entirely new level this spring, anchoring the defensive line and serving as a mentor to younger players.
Woods has received praise from his defensive coordinator, Wilcox, who labeled Woods one of the standouts thus far into the spring. Woods appears to be developing into the dominant defensive presence many envisioned when he enrolled. Woods has the size and strength to continue the tradition of strong defensive tackles in the mold of Mike Patterson, Sedrick Ellis and Jurrell Casey.
Offensively, sophomore wide receiver Darreus Rogers has been a revelation in spring practice. When Marqise Lee was out last season, Rogers displayed flashes of his enormous potential. If spring practices are any indication, he intends to follow up on his freshman showing with an electrifying sophomore campaign.
With strong hands and a physical presence, Rogers has dominated defensive backs. Rogers’ prowess in the red zone is evident, out-muscling and jumping over defenders to make highlight reel touchdown catches. The combination of Rogers and junior wideout Nelson Agholor splitting out wide next season has to have coach Sarkisian salivating.
Rogers and Woods are just two Trojans making an impact this spring, and the tremendous display of talent thus far bodes well for Sarkisian’s debut season at the helm of the program. The more weapons Sarkisian has, the more balanced and dangerous his offense will be. In that case, Sark can follow through on another one of his promises: that this year would be one of reloading and not rebuilding.

We were at the scrimmage yesterday and it was lovely day. The offence looked bad, and they are not blossoming to say the least. They are using the same Lane Kiffin plays which help destroy the offence.
Kessler could not throw the football yesterday, and made Brown look better even though Brown was off target a lot.
With only two weeks of practice remaining, I do not know how you can say the team is blossoming.

Following two wins against Pacific and Concordia, the No. 8 Trojans ended their regular season with a loss on the road to No. 3 Pepperdine in five sets (18-25, 25-21, 19-25, 25-14, 11-15). USC’s record falls to 16-10 overall and 14-10 in Mountain Pacific Sports Federation play. Once the rest of the conference finishes regular-season play, the Trojans will know whether or not they qualify for playoffs.
Young gun · Freshman outside Lucas Yoder, who leads the Trojans in kills per set (4.04), racked up a team-high 19 kills against Pepperdine. – Tucker McWhirter | Daily Trojan
The loss was the second of the season to the Waves, with the Trojans having fallen 3-1 at home in January.
Freshman outside hitter Lucas Yoder opened the match with two kills and senior opposite hitter Tanner Jansen had one, giving the Trojans a 3-2 lead in the first set. Two service errors by the Trojans kept Pepperdine within one, and two kills by the Waves tied the first set at six. Three more kills by Yoder kept the Trojans within two, while Pepperdine put up two consecutive kills to take a 13-11 lead, forcing a USC timeout.
The Trojans stumbled out of the timeout with two consecutive attack errors, causing USC head coach Bill Ferguson to call another timeout, trailing Pepperdine 11-15. The Waves resumed with another block, and errors by the Trojans allowed the Waves to make a 6-2 run and eventually take a 21-13 lead. The Trojans were unable to stop Pepperdine’s momentum and lost the first set 18-25.
Freshman middle blocker Andy Benesh and junior setter Micah Christenson opened the second set with a block, and kills by Yoder, Jansen and junior middle blocker Robert Feathers, as well as a block by senior outside hitter Madison McKibbin, gave the Trojans a 9-7 lead. An ace by Christenson and two kills by Yoder extended USC’s lead to 16-11 and forced a Pepperdine timeout. A kill by Yoder and three consecutive errors by Pepperdine gave the Trojans a 20-12 lead. Pepperdine made a small run, but another kill by Yoder and one from McKibbin kept the Trojans ahead 23-20. A kill by Yoder set up set point for the Trojans and a kill by Benesh ended the set 25-21 in favor of the Trojans and tied the match at one set apiece.
The third set opened with both sides splitting points, but kills by Yoder and Feathers gave the Trojans an 8-5 lead. The Waves again tied the set, this time at 10 apiece, but an error by the Trojans and kills by the Waves gave Pepperdine a 13-10 lead. Kills by Benesh, Jansen, Christenson and redshirt junior outside hitter Joey Booth, as well as blocks by Booth and Feathers, kept the Trojans within four, despite Pepperdine’s defensive spree, giving the Waves a 20-16 lead. The Trojans, however, had no answer to Pepperdine’s defense and lost the third set 19-25.
Feathers opened the set with a kill and a block by Yoder gave the Trojans an early 4-1 lead in a must-win fourth set. A kill by Benesh and a net violation against Pepperdine extended the Trojans’ lead to 6-2. Two kills each from Yoder, Booth and junior outside hitter Cristian Rivera kept the Trojans ahead 13-8. Kills from Yoder, Benesh and Booth, and two errors by the Waves, extended USC’s lead to 21-10. A kill by Rivera followed by a Pepperdine error set up set point for the Trojans and a kill by Booth won the set for the Trojans, 25-14, to force a fifth set.
Despite hitting only .107 in the first set, the Trojans finished the crucial fourth set, hitting .577 with 16 kills and only one error.
The final set began like the third, with each team splitting points until Pepperdine was able to take a 5-3 lead. Kills by Benesh, Yoder and Rivera kept the Trojans in the game, though the Waves pulled away to a 12-8 lead. Kills by Benesh, Rivera and Booth cut Pepperdine’s lead to 14-11 and a service error by USC ended the match with a Pepperdine win in the fifth set, 15-11.
Overall, Yoder led all players with 19 kills throughout the match, while senior libero Henry Cassiday led the way with 15 digs.  Christenson was the only Trojan to record a service ace on the day.
The Trojans host men’s volleyball alumni on Saturday at 7 p.m. in the Galen Center for the team’s annual alumni match.

With three weeks of practices in the books for spring football, the new-look USC Trojans are starting to find their stride. Both sides of the ball are adjusting to new coaches and new schemes, and given the fast pace at which USC practices, players already have a large volume of reps under their belts, which has facilitated the learning process greatly.
Quick caller · Should redshirt junior quarterback Cody Kessler retain his starting job, he could be barking out more calls per game than ever before. Kessler averaged 212 passing yards (65.4 percent) per game last season. – Ralf Cheung | Daily Trojan
“I’m a believer in muscle memory, of getting on the field and doing it over and over and over again,” said head coach Steve Sarkisian. “Not that I don’t value meeting time, but I do believe that actually doing it and getting those reps and learning from your mistakes, that you can improve more rapidly and the retention is better.”
Though the offense and defense are in constant competition with one another, Sarkisian was reluctant to deem one unit ahead of the other at this point in spring practice.
“They both have their moments of doing good stuff,” Sarkisian said. “The defensive front today, especially in the run game, was really good. Offensively, we need to improve our pad level, because we’re not running the ball the way I would like yet, but we’ll get there. But in the passing game, I think the offense is making some plays, so it goes both ways. That’s a sign of a good team — that it’s a battle back and forth.”
WORN DOWN
Sarkisian might prefer not to compare offensive and defensive progress this spring, but it seems as if the offense has adjusted to the fast pace of practice better than the defense. The defense frequently appears to have the upper hand in the first half of practice, but the offense performs better toward the end.
“I don’t know if that’s necessarily a theme,” Sarkisian said. “Part of this system can give the offense an advantage way late in practice from a conditioning standpoint — physically and mentally. That’s part of it when the games roll around too. That’s why we make it as hard as we can throughout practice — to prepare our guys for game-like atmosphere, which I think we do a good job of doing.”
New defensive coordinator Justin Wilcox is aware of his unit’s tendency to get fatigued during the end of practice and has emphasized this to his players.
“We just have to continue to sustain throughout practice,” Wilcox said. “We’ve had a tendency to start practices fast and the first half of practice play well. And then the second half, to not play as well, so we have to continue to emphasize finishing practices, because that’s when you start getting up in the play count. In plays 100 through 120, that’s when we’ve not been as good.”
JOINING THE FUN
Former head coach Lane Kiffin was criticized for many things during his USC tenure. One of them was the way that he seldom used his talented tight ends in the Trojans’ passing game. Last season, USC’s three scholarship tight ends — Xavier Grimble, Randall Telfer and Jalen Cope-Fitzpatrick — combined for just 32 receptions, 353 yards and three touchdowns all year.
Those numbers seem destined to be improved upon this season. While at Washington, Sarkisian’s primary tight end during his last three seasons with the school was Austin Seferian-Jenkins, who caught 146 passes for 1840 yards and 21 touchdowns in his career and won the John Mackey Award as the nation’s best tight end last season.
Grimble declared for the NFL Draft after last season, but Telfer and Cope-Fitzpatrick returned. Telfer has missed all of spring due to injury, and Cope-Fitzpatrick has taken advantage of the extra reps, wowing coaches with his performance. Senior Chris Willson looks more seasoned after switching to tight end last season, and come fall the nation’s top high school tight end, Bryce Dixon, will also be in the mix.
“No question [the tight ends will be used more],” offensive coordinator Clay Helton said. “You’ve seen Jalen already this spring have several big plays for us. If you look at what Coach Sark has done in the pass, with Austin Seferian-Jenkins, the tight end is a huge part of this offense. Having Jalen out there, with Chris Willson doing a good job and eventually getting Randall back, we’re excited to use those tight ends. Those guys are very valuable in this offense.”
QUICK HITS
In installing his new offensive scheme, Sarkisian has made it a point to simplify the offense’s terminology, which was quite lengthy under USC’s previous staff.
“We’ve really cut the verbiage down, there’s a lot less words, but I think it’s efficient. We’re almost getting it. We’re really close to clicking it for the guys, and when we do it’ll be a lot of fun.”
With the Trojans still limited on scholarship players due to NCAA sanctions, the amount of live tackling during practice has been an issue for the past few seasons. Wilcox has taken caution in how much tackling he allows his defensive players to engage in.
“You work tackling in controlled environments, where the number of bodies potentially on the ground [is minimized]. You work in those one-on-one situations with bags. [Tackling] is something you’d love to work on all the time, but you’ve got to be smart about how you do it.”
USC’s next practice will take place on Tuesday at 4 p.m. on Howard Jones Field.

This Saturday, the USC Concerts Committee hosted its annual Springfest concert, featuring headline artists Diplo, Tyga and New Politics. Starting at noon, artists took the stage in front of Leavey Library and performed for the incoming crowds. Opening acts included Leo, winner of the iVoice competition; Breach the Summit; Night Riots and more. When concertgoers needed a food break, there were food trucks parked near Pardee Tower all day with food for purchase, including the Grilled Cheese Truck, the Boba Truck and Greenz on Wheelz.
Benjamin Dunn | Daily Trojan
At 6:30 p.m., the first headliner, Danish band New Politics, took the stage, and alt-rock fans rocked out for the next 90 minutes. Songs on the set list included “Berlin,” “Stuck On You” and the band’s most famous song, “Harlem.” The band even surprised guests with a rendition of the popular Justin Timberlake song “My Love.” Though headliner Tyga was scheduled to perform at 8 p.m., a rowdy crowd prevented him from starting on time. When he finally did come out at around 8:30 p.m., the sound quality was off and low and the crowd swarmed the stage and defied officials who demanded they take a few steps back. When Tyga took the stage, he greeted the crowd warmly, noting that USC’s crowd was much more welcoming than UCLA’s.
At 10 p.m., Diplo, a Los Angeles-based DJ, greeted a packed crowd and the concert’s energy was revitalized. Some of the songs he performed included “Original Don,” his Major Lazer hit, and “Express Yourself.” Partway through, the sound team was able to fix the problems that plagued Tyga’s set, making for a great finale to Springfest 2014.

The white whale of the current technological market is one we always hear in relation to any set-top box: the persistently rumored “iTV,” the evolved form of the Apple TV that Steve Jobs apparently cracked the code of how to make before his untimely death. Despite the pressure and wide range of rumors, with some suggesting that it’s an actual 4K-resolution television and others saying it’d be a replacement for the cable DVR, Apple has been steady with its current Apple TV.
This bears mentioning because as Apple remains idle, other companies are starting to not only boost up their own streaming devices, but in some cases, also expand into avenues that the tech-giant has yet to explore. Just last week, Amazon officially entered into the foray with the Amazon Fire TV, priced at $99, which would sync up nicely with people already in Amazon’s ecosystem and also stations itself as a gaming device, with an additional controller accessory that can be purchased for $39.
The recently released Roku 3, which costs less and boasts more channels, can play certain titles but nothing to the level of commitment that Amazon is demonstrating with the Fire TV. The device will actually feature titles created in-house and with more to come, as Amazon has been gathering game developers and purchased Double Helix, who recently created the Killer Instinct reboot for the Xbox One.
In addition, Google is considering venturing into the set-top arena with some form of an Android TV in the near future. What’s interesting is that Google had tried to enter the television market with the ill-fated Google TV, which petered out around 2012. Where that one failed, however, beyond a cumbersome interface, was in its attempt to treat the television as a computer, which made developers hesitant to create applications for it.
A theoretical Android TV would likely be an expansion off of the Chromecast, the plug-in Google Play device that’s been able to sell like hot cakes (a $35 price tag doesn’t hurt), and with them opening up the SDK for developers, a swarm of apps have come out for the device, expanding it beyond its capabilities.
And yet, all of this seems to go back to Apple, as everyone seems to be waiting with bated breath for what, exactly, is the revolutionary approach they’ll take to the set-top box and the television market as a whole. The more the company lingers, the more people seem to worry about just how expansive the device will be.
The last round of rumors implied that the reason Apple seems to be taking longer than expected on the next “true” Apple TV is that the company is trying to negotiate with content providers and cable companies so that the device can act as a DVR, syncing your iTunes library with your video content.
Instead of the à la carte method that consumers have been asking for from cable companies, however, it looks like you would still need to purchase a cable bundle to make the most of the device. Apple has already taken the first step forward with a preliminary agreement with Comcast and is also negotiating with Time Warner Cable. Even if this is what Steve Jobs meant when he said he “finally figured it out” regarding television content, it could be the case many were hoping, and it could very well turn out to be true, that the new set-top box is what will allow people to finally cut the cable and have the device be their primary vessel for content.
With the television market and the way we consume content rapidly evolving (people might not be watching “TV” as much but people are consuming media at an expedited rate), these set-top devices are an efficient and quick way to access the shows and movies we want to watch. Amazon’s foray into these departments will compel Google and other companies to call Apple’s bluff.
The revolution will be televised; by whom is now up to the companies in question.

Kevin Casey is a member of the ABBA fan club. Don’t believe him? Just ask to see his official card — yes, they exist. But back when the musical director for the Mamma Mia! broadway tour was at USC, he would have categorized the Swedish pop group as something his mother would listen to. He’s since changed his tune.

“I’ve become a huge fan,” Casey said.
Casey, who moved from Florida to Huntington Beach, Calif. as a kid, grew up listening to bands such as the Beach Boys and The Beatles.
His interest in ABBA is recent, having started after he was offered the gig for Mamma Mia! last August. At first, he was skeptical of taking the job (“I had kind of a snobby attitude for it,” he said.) But while researching the production, something clicked for him.
Normally, musicals have a historic incident or a novel they are based on. But the only thing Casey could find to research for Mamma Mia! was the music. So Casey bought all eight albums and listened.
“It really permeated,” Casey said. “It’s a band becoming this international phenomenon, writing songs not in their language. To reach that many people — what they accomplished is sort of unrivaled.”
Mamma Mia!, which is headed for the Segerstrom Center for the Arts on Tuesday (a homecoming of sorts for Casey), has been on Broadway since 2001. The musical currently holds the distinction of being the ninth longest-running show in Broadway history. That statistic doesn’t surprise Casey.
“Their music — it’s meant a lot to a lot of people,” he said.  “People can relate to this; it’s about people having people problems: mother-daughter problems, trouble with your ex … problems that everyone can understand.”
More than that, in a more cynical age, the production makes people smile. Casey said that it’s normal for audience members to stand up in their seats and dance, imitating the choreography and singing along.
“It’s fun knowing that your work has touched people, it’s making people happy,” Casey said.
That idea, of bringing people together through music, was what first drew Casey himself into the music profession. He traces his interest back to when he joined his high school show choir, the Marina High “Mariners.” It was the first time he had played with other musicians and the first time he played in front of a live audience. Casey was captivated.
“That was a real ‘aha’ moment,” he said.
He went on to study music composition and conducting at USC, but had trouble finding his place musically in what was then a predominantly classical curriculum.
“Now there’s a film scoring program, a popular music one,” Casey said. “None of that existed back then. It was strictly classical and I was sort of a fish out of water.”
Classes such as Dr. Thom Mason’s jazz improvisation however brought him into contact with new genres.
“What I really got out of [USC] was being exposed to so much music,” Casey said. “Music history class was my favorite. It was the first time I heard Tchaikovsky, the first time I heard Stravinsky. It made me realize that the music I grew up listening to was just scratching the surface, and there was so much out there.”
After Casey left USC, he worked at an arts high school as a teacher and as the school’s musical director. Working on musicals gave him experience conducting performances, which eventually led him to take a job on tour as a music director in 2001.
“It was a small tour, all one-nighters, small towns,” Casey said. “It was great. The smaller the town, the more fun it was.”
Touring still holds an allure for Casey today. For Mamma Mia! (which he already committed to for another season), one of his favorite parts of touring is the opportunity to explore the local scenes during each leg of the tour.
“It’s a really fun way to see the country,” Casey said.
But the best part for him about being on Mamma Mia! is the music. Despite having worked intensively on the songs for the past eight months, he said he still sees the music through fresh eyes.
“I’m always thinking from the audience’s [perspective],” Casey said. “When they come to the show, for them it’s show number one. I want them to have that experience.”
His personal favorite song in the production is “Waterloo.”
“It’s the very last one and it gets the crowd up and going,” Casey said.
His parents, who still live in the area, will be at the performance next week. But between his mother and him, there’s no question who the bigger ABBA fan is now.
After all, as Casey said, “she’s not in the fan club.”
 
Mamma Mia! will be playing at the Segerstrom Center for the Arts from April 8-13.

The Orange County Public Library System hosted its 8th “Literary Orange” on April 5 at the Irvine Marriott in Irvine Calif., its annual daylong event that celebrates the art of writing. This event brought together passionate writers, readers and critics in an environment to openly discuss and learn about the process of writing and the ever-changing landscape of fiction and nonfiction writing in books; for example, up-and-coming genres such as “Fictional Magical Realism.”  In addition, USC Annenberg Professor Judy Muller spoke as a panelist.
This gathering allowed avid readers the opportunity to have their books signed by renowned authors while directly interacting with these notable literary figures and nibbling on yummy desserts.
With extremely successful ticket sales, Literary Orange has proven itself as an established and popular literature event in the art world. This event was put together by many Orange County librarians and volunteers, all of whom dedicated enormous amounts of time to bring a variety of authors to this event. At the helm of these volunteers was Helen Fried, the county librarian for OC Libraries since 2008.
“It’s what we like to do the community,” Fried said. “I think everyone appreciates and enjoys how we have many different speakers and panels. We try to reach a variety of topics and different authors. We actually have several writers that attend the program, because we have a panel on how to get literary agents and publishing. There’s something for everyone. It’s very compelling to hear about these writers and how they got started.”
This year’s convention hosted  authors Ann Hood and Marlo Thomas as keynote speaker. These two powerful and successful women dedicated their time to Literary Orange to promote the importance of literature. Ann Hood, author of best-selling memoir Comfort: A Journey Through Grief, offered some advice about the importance of events similar to Literary Orange.
“I always get very excited by people who are excited about books,” Hood said. “We get this negative feeling that books are dead, but coming to Literary Orange is very affirming for a writer to be involved in — because to see people read makes you so excited.”
In addition to conventions that raise awareness about the field of humanities, Hood stressed in her keynote speech the importance of an individual reading and writing as much as possible. She emphasized that words are the most important aspect of human emotion and expression.
“Life goes on and starts throwing stuff in your path — you could pick up a book and forget about it. But if you wanted to make sense of it, you could write about it,” Hood said to the hundred attendees. “That dual source of comfort where I could read to get away from it, and I could write to understand it.”
The community, in turn, responded with the same amount of enthusiasm and positivity. First-time attendees and aspiring authors themselves, Esther Denn and Robyn Waugh, discussed their favorite moments of the day.
“To me this [event] is a step in putting forward my goal and vision,” Denn said. “I really enjoyed Marlo Thomas as a guest speaker. It started off with Marlo Thomas saying, ‘What is your next chapter? Because it is never too late.’ And she was right. I’m 65, and I’m going to write my book. This is just another cog in the wheel towards reaching my goal.”
Denn and Waugh were also pleased that the event promoted hopeful writers. Numerous speakers and attendees themselves offered advice to young adults and students who hope to pursue writing as a career.
“This sounds so obvious. I meet a lot of people who want to write, but do not read,” Hood said. “I learned how to write from reading books. Read everything. Write every day and practice the art.”
The name of the convention wasn’t just orange, the color was also a theme throughout. The venue was decorated quite literally with oranges, and each attendee purchased books placed in an orange reusable bag. Literary Orange, hosted by 34 public libraries in over 12 cities, victoriously celebrated the importance of literature in the 21st century and provided the perfect environment for aspiring writers.

What do Cal Tech, San Diego State University, University of Chicago, University of Pennsylvania and UC Riverside have in common that USC does not? All of these schools provide some form of gender-neutral housing, an important housing policy that more and more schools are beginning to adopt.
Gender-neutral housing is not a new issue on the USC campus. In 2011, students pushed for this policy change, demonstrating a strong backing from the student body. The USC administration has dragged its feet, however, leaving behind part of the Trojan community and leaving our university behind other top schools around the country.
USC currently has “gender inclusive” housing, a sort of compromise from earlier efforts. This option is only available on the Rainbow Floor, a special interest community for LGBT students located at Century Apartments, and still requires that a student room with another student of the same gender in their bedroom. The only difference is that you can share the apartment with students of another gender. For example, two students registered as female and rooming together could share the same apartment as two other students registered as male and rooming together. The female and male students, however, are not allowed to live in the same bedroom. In other words, there is little that is gender neutral about this policy. For students whose registered gender does not match their gender identity, they are put between a rock and a hard place — either they room with people they might not be comfortable with, or they leave USC housing for other housing options.
As a transgender female student on campus, I was unable to apply for USC housing last year with my female friends. Though all of us wanted to live together, the university would not allow me to live with them in USC housing because I was registered as a male student at the time. Despite the fact that I planned to return to the university as a female student, my choice with USC housing was to either live in a male space I was not comfortable with, live alone or come out publicly before I was ready and live in LGBTQ special housing with a man. We ended up pursuing housing options outside of USC.
The current proposal for gender-neutral housing is simple. USC should allow apartments and                 suite-style living to be used for gender-neutral housing. Gender-neutral housing would be allowed as an opt-in feature, ensuring that only students who are comfortable with and desire to live in gender-neutral housing will be living there. This proposal would not require the creation or modification of any housing, merely a policy change in how roommates are assigned.
This is not just a policy for transgender or        gender-nonconforming students. This policy would benefit all USC students by allowing them to live in the spaces and with the people they are most comfortable with. That means the majority of the student body could continue living with roommates of the same gender, while students who prefer gender-neutral housing could make use of it. The proposal would not cost USC any money, nor would it limit housing options. It’s time USC adopted gender-neutral housing so that we might continue to ensure that all students can live in a safe and comfortable space at this wonderful university.

This needs to be pushed for to provide options for those that would prefer this arrangement. It is not forcing anyone to do anything they are uncomfortable with, simply providing options for those that would find this situation advantageous. I find it progressive and positive, let’s make it happen.

When I went on a Target run with my mother during my freshman year of college, I opted for the novel Lean In instead of embarking on the path of Hunger Games fandom. Rather than digging into the world of Katniss and Peeta, I dove headfirst into Sheryl Sandberg’s feminist manifesto and couldn’t get enough of it.
Wendy Fu | Daily Trojan
 
The novel became my new altarpiece; I worshipped Sandberg’s words, hanging onto her sentences to fully absorb the gravity of her message. I read biographic articles on her, watched her TED talks, studied her essays and, soon enough, told myself I was surely her No. 1 fan. She was the Beyoncé of my intellect. And instead of being “Drunk in Love,” I was drunk in feminism.
As my admiration for Sandberg soared, I soon realized many others felt far from the way I did. Though Sandberg served as an inspiration for my own dreams, I discovered critics who vehemently opposed her teachings. The Ivy-league educated Sandberg is a New York Times-best selling author with more accolades than I can name, but her credentials meant nothing for those angered by her take on feminism.
Business Week’s Sheelah Kolhatkar wrote in her article, “What Sheryl Sandberg Doesn’t Get About the Gender Gap,” that Sandberg focuses on the upper echelon of female workers, ignoring the middle class of working women.
Daniella Gibbs Léger in Essence argues that Lean In doesn’t speak to lower-income women or women of color.
The Huffington Post ’s Vanessa Garcia recently penned an article called “Why I Won’t Lean In.” She compares Lean In to the erotic romance novel Fifty Shades of Grey. She argues that leaning in is the equivalent of submission; but in drawing such parallels, she fails to grasp the true meaning behind Sandberg’s language. Leaning in is the very opposite of passivity. To lean in is to engage actively in one’s life, to never take no for answer, to rise up and to continue the fight.
The criticism of Sandberg reveals a glaring problem with the women’s empowerment movement: a lack of unity among women.
Undoubtedly, most of the criticism targeted toward Sandberg comes from other women. Rather than supporting one another in their endeavors for success, women tear each other down.
As Joan Walsh of Salon put it, “Steven Sandberg would never face this kind of rage for writing a how-to-get-ahead book.”
But this isn’t just my own take. It’s not just a conclusion I arrived at from witnessing the cattiness of college girls. Granted, I’ve made my fair share of judgments about another girl’s outfit (let’s be real, ladies, we all do it), but at the end of the day, I value my friendships with other women and credit their love and support for much of my own progress in life. But looking at the larger picture, such support isn’t as commonplace as you might think. And this notion is proven by statistics.
In 2012, the Atlantic reported that women are not a unified voting bloc. Why don’t women vote for other women, especially with such lack of prominent female voices in the world?
Dr. Peggy Drexler of the Huffington Post cited a study by the Workplace Bullying Institute that showed how women bully other women at work through verbal abuse and job sabotage more than 70 percent of the time. With so much progress to make, it’s imperative that women see the value of joining forces rather than undercutting each other.
In the way that groups of different ethnicities or identities have joined together to fight back against intolerance and create progress, women must do the same. Without a cohesive group and a focused vision, it is unlikely that these jarring statistics will ever change.
In the way that African Americans marched for freedom in the Civil Rights Movement or members of the LGBTQ community have rallied for equality, women must recognize our strength in numbers and stand in solidarity. Marginalized groups find success in unity and achieve together, not apart.
I do not encourage a blind following; educating oneself about the credibility of an individual is necessary. Petty criticisms, however, bar progress. Taking a closer look at how we, as women, view one another and speak of each other is worthwhile.
In our battle to break down barriers, it’s evident we stand as our own roadblock.
