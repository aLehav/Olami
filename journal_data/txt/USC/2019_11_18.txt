The USC women’s volleyball team split its two matches on the weekend’s Bay Area road trip. USC dropped the first game Friday to No. 4 Stanford before picking up a win Sunday at No. 20 Cal. 
Stanford managed to slow All-American senior outside hitter Khalia Lanier, who had averaged over 32 kills in her previous four games. Lanier was held in check by the Cardinal, hitting just .164. Two of Lanier’s three worst games hitting-wise this season came against Stanford. 
USC got off to a dismal start Friday, losing the first set 25-12. Lanier, the Trojans’ most potent offensive threat, didn’t record a kill until the second set. Stanford took advantage of a couple of weak service return rotations and finished the set on an 11-1 run. The rotation, with freshman outside hitter Kalen Owes in the back row, continued to give USC trouble all evening.
The second set didn’t go much better for the Trojans, as they lost the frame by a margin of 8. USC managed to scrape out a victory in the third set, but the momentum of the match never seemed to shift, and Stanford closed it out in the fourth.
In the teams’ last matchup, when USC put up a fight against Stanford, the Cardinal were missing senior outside hitter Kathryn Plummer, last year’s AVCA National Player of the Year. Plummer returned for this matchup and led the Cardinal with 17 kills.
USC struggled to hit all night, posting just a .142 hitting percentage. The Trojans could not muster the offense that previously seemed automatic for Lanier.
“We just [have to] pass the ball a little bit better,” head coach Brent Crouch said. “If we can get it up to the net and distribute it a little more, that will help. If we are passing off the net or digging off the net, then we are going to have to put the balls to the left side.”
USC needs to improve its passing to help last year’s Pac-12 Freshman of the Year, setter Raquel Lázaro, distribute the ball more evenly.
“It’s really about our first contacts,” Crouch said. “Can we serve really well, can we dig really well, can we pass really well — if we can do that, then we are going to score points at the net and we’re going to block at the net.”
The Trojans were able to effectively block in the final two sets of the matchup with Stanford and throughout the entire match against Cal. USC outblocked the Bears 10-4 to lead it to the 3-1 victory. 
“I think we are one of the few teams that can execute the blocking game plan that we had versus Cal,” Crouch said. “A lot of other teams can’t do that. We are able to help in the middle and get to the outside.”
Freshman opposite hitter Emilia Weske assisted on five blocks against Cal. She also served a career-high six aces, helping USC earn a 10-6 advantage in that department. 
Lanier got back on track against the Bears, leading the Trojans with 16 kills and hitting .308. Other key players like Weske and senior middle blocker Jasmine Gross were able to step up offensively. Gross had 11 kills on 23 attempts and hit .391 overall. Overall, USC outhit the Bears .325 to .246.
USC hosts Oregon and Oregon State this weekend at Galen Center. The two matches will help solidify the Trojans’ seeding for the upcoming Pac-12 Tournament.

With another week of NFL football in the books, we’ve reached the point where we are counting down the weeks rather than counting them up. This week, I’ll be taking a look at teams that have a 40% to 75% chance of making the playoffs according to The New York Times or the FiveThirtyEight’s predictive models.  
AFC
Buffalo Bills (7-3) 
FiveThirtyEight: 71%, NYT: 66%
The Bills have the best record of the teams in this cluster of playoff contention, but they lack impressive wins. They’ve beaten up on cellar-dwellers and lost handily to the Patriots, Eagles and the enigmatic Browns. Buffalo’s defense has been among the league’s best, but it might be due to weak opponents. On offense, quarterback Josh Allen and wide receiver John Brown have flashed their potential but remain unproven against stronger competition. 
The chances to prove themselves will come. The Bills play at Dallas, versus Baltimore, at Pittsburgh and at New England from Weeks 13-16: all games they could drop. With two winnable home games against the Broncos and Jets, the Bills have a decent shot at going 3-3 in the last six weeks, which would almost certainly get them into the playoffs. 
Oakland Raiders (6-4)
FiveThirtyEight: 41%, NYT: 48%
The Raiders have played surprisingly well this season, with all four of their losses coming against legitimate contenders. Head coach Jon Gruden has put together a viable offense with quarterback Derek Carr, rookie running back Josh Jacobs and tight end Darren Waller all exceeding expectations. 
They haven’t quite proven they can hang with the best, but they won’t need to do so to get into the postseason. Aside from an easy game against the Jets in Week 12 and one they will probably lose in Kansas City in Week 13, the Raiders have four games where they should be slight favorites: versus Tennessee, versus Jacksonville, at L.A. Chargers and at Denver. If they win all four of those and get to 5-1 on their last six, they are a lock to make the playoffs.
Indianapolis Colts (6-4)
FiveThirtyEight: 54%, NYT: 46%
The Colts are another team that has surprisingly earned its way into the AFC playoff conversation with impressive wins over the Chiefs and Texans. However, the Colts are also the team with the most perplexing losses, falling to the tanking Miami Dolphins and the underwhelming Chargers. If they can upset the Texans again next week, they will control their destiny in the AFC South, but if they lose, they’ll likely need to win four of their final five games to secure a playoff berth. 
NFC
Dallas Cowboys (6-4)
FiveThirtyEight: 62%, NYT: 66%
Philadelphia Eagles (5-5)
FiveThirtyEight: 47%, NYT: 39%
It would be impossible to tell the story of either team without the other. Unlike the AFC, where four teams are vying for the two Wild Card slots, the NFC has a clear gap between the Wild Card teams and the rest. The biggest uncertainty is which of these bitter rivals will make it out of the NFC East. 
On the shoulders of quarterback Dak Prescott, the Cowboys’ offense has seen a revival this season and is currently fourth in the league in points per game. The story of the season for the Eagles has once again been injuries — this time, mainly in the receiving corps. They are still loaded with talent on the offensive and defensive lines, but the defensive backs continue to be the team’s biggest liability. 
It’d be irresponsible not to mention the 37-10 thrashing the Cowboys handed the Eagles in Week 7 in Dallas. The Week 16 rematch in Philadelphia will likely decide who wins the division title.
Four of the Eagles’ remaining games should be easy wins (at Dolphins, at Redskins and the Giants twice), and their upcoming Week 12 matchup against the Seahawks will be a good indicator of whether they deserve to play in January. The Cowboys have the more difficult remaining schedule; they play two tough road games against the Patriots and Bears and host the Bills and Rams. Unless they miraculously manage to win all four of those, the Cowboys’ hopes will likely depend on their matchup with Philly.

“It’s about to get super weird,” an announcer told spectators shuffling into the Meatwad Dome, a 25-foot-tall hemisphere designed to resemble a character from “Aqua Teen Hunger Force,” for an immersive, 360-degree screening of the psychedelic short “Six Minutes Of Your Life That You’ll Never Get Back.”
Featuring optical illusions of M.C. Escher, “Six Minutes” distorts viewers’ perspectives by warping from a sprawling cityscape to a strand of DNA in a matter of moments. The disorientation was not out of place at an event that existed almost entirely outside of the norm. 
This was just one facet of Adult Swim Festival, the second annual iteration of the entertainment network’s two-day experience that brought together fans with a diverse array of interests in music and comedy at Banc of California Stadium over the weekend.
Attendees went all out in their self-expression. People sported dyed hair of every hue as well as costumes of their favorite Adult Swim characters such as Rick from “Rick and Morty,” Jesus from “Black Jesus” and Dr. Rockzo from “Metalocalypse.”
“What really stood out to me [was] how diverse the crowd was,” said Connor Christ, a freshman majoring in music industry. “I definitely saw the most people in costume than I ever have. I kind of felt like I was at a ComicCon or some convention like that.”
Adult Swim matched the dedication of festival-goers by creating over-the-top activations for the event such as a 40-foot-tall inflatable slide shaped like the head of Morty from “Rick and Morty,” a mechanical-bull-style hot dog ride and a “Rick and Morty” VR minigame machine called the “Rickflector.”
“You might die, it’s fine, don’t worry about it. Death is cool,” Rick said in a voiceover as the simulation began.
Throughout the weekend, fans had opportunities to get exclusive first looks at upcoming Adult Swim content. 
Similar to Kanye West’s recent preview of “Jesus is King” at The Forum, viewers were required to secure their phones in Yondr pouches to prevent  them from recording unreleased material. The most anticipated screening was of a new episode of the fourth season of “Rick and Morty”. Fans waited in line for more than an hour to get into one of the five screenings of the episode, which was set to air for the first time the next night.
“The way they did it was really interesting,” said Grant Conley, a freshman majoring in music industry. “They put us with a bunch of other fans … They hyped up the crowd by [asking], ‘Who’s your favorite character?’ It was just an interesting experience, I’m glad I got to do that.”
By far, the most bizarre yet captivating event of the weekend was “The Eric Andre Show Live!” 
Known for its crude satire of late night talk shows, the Adult Swim show translated well in front of a live audience. The opening credits of “The Eric Andre Show” depict him destroying his set in various ways. For the live version, he hurled gallons of Silk soy milk, dozens of hamburger buns and raw hot dogs at the audience.
“Eric Andre was just unforgettable,” Conley said. “That was one of the most interesting sets I’ve ever seen in my life.”
Andre was joined onstage by his co-host Hannibal Buress, who donned a bedazzled mask and sport jacket. The pair interviewed surprise guests Seth Green from Adult Swim’s “Robot Chicken,” singer Elah Hale and a random audience member named William. Andre also invited a trio of audience members onstage to compete to see who could chug an entire bottle of ranch dressing the fastest.
“I’ve seen comedy live but this was something else. This was just a completely different genre,” Conley said. “I can’t even put it in a box. It was just so interesting and entertaining.”
He brought out a slew of rappers for a segment titled “Rapper Ninja Warrior,” during which they were supposed to freestyle while navigating a series of zany obstacles. They were blindfolded and made to walk across a wooden beam as Andre and crew members pelted them with hamburger buns and poked at them with dildos.
The live music component of the festival showcased acts from different genres, including rappers 2 Chainz and Vince Staples to metal bands Dethklok and Inter Arma. For the sake of logistics, the two main stages were placed directly next to each other to allow one act to set up while another performed, making for seamless transitions.
“The one thing that actually stuck out to me the most was how the stages were set up,” Conley said. “You could always hear the other artist instead of having to sacrifice and go to a completely other side of the stadium and miss an artist.”
One of the first night’s highlights came during a rare set from Captain Murphy, a.k.a. Flying Lotus, who was accompanied onstage by Thundercat. Murphy took the mic to announce a special surprise.
“I know y’all know about my man MF Doom, right?” he asked the crowd. “I brought my man all the way from London to rock with y’all tonight.”
Out walked the masked rapper, or so it seemed. FlyLo took off the mask to reveal Buress, who would return to the stage the next day for a live rendition of “The Eric Andre Show.” 
After his appearance, Buress could be spotted mingling in the crowd with the likes of Blake Anderson from Comedy Central’s “Workaholics,” Kamasi Washington, who played alongside Thundercat last week at Camp Flog Gnaw, and musicians Duckwrth and Eryn Allen Kane.
Another of the festival’s noteworthy guests, Gerald “Slink” Johnson, star of “Black Jesus,” established a banter with Freddie Gibbs during his set with Madlib the next day. Gibbs, who came onstage with his daughter on his shoulders, would gab with Johnson between songs, quipping at one point that Johnson should run for president in 2020. 
“It’s electrifying, energetic, cutting-edge and fun. I’m digging it,” Johnson said. “I’m most looking forward to smoking up a lot of good people’s good weed.” 
Two last-minute adjustments were made to the lineup. Fellow Atlanta native 2 Chainz replaced Young Thug while Grammy-nominated rapper Rapsody replaced Billboard-chart-record-breaker Lil Nas X. 
The replacement performers did not disappoint. Rapsody passionately performed cuts from her recently released album “Eve.” 2 Chainz was backed by a four-piece band and brought out signees from his record label T.R.U. to perform their song “Shoot It Out” live for the first time.
Vince Staples was shrouded in a thick cloud of haze for the duration of his performance, likely to draw attention to his set design. The large screen behind him was divided into eight televisions, each tuned to a different channel showing popular shows with Staples edited into them. He appeared in the opening credits of “Rick and Morty,” “That ’70s Show” and “The Simpsons” as well as scenes from “The Office,” “South Park” and “Game of Thrones.”
Considering his set design and recent, surreal debut episodes of “The Vince Staples Show,” it would appear that he’s gearing up to release a new album. Both episodes, “So What” and “Sheet Music,” were accompanied by the release of singles of the same titles that he played live at the festival for the first time.
“First, I’d like to apologize ’cause I am not Frank Ocean,” Staples joked early in his set, referring to last week’s controversy at Camp Flog Gnaw. “Second off, I wanna welcome everybody to ‘The Vince Staples Show.’ I’m happy you could come. I’m not, but I’ma pretend.”
Overall, Adult Swim Festival’s combination of varying attractions worked to broaden the event’s appeal beyond a specific niche to garner a larger audience.
“This was definitely … the most interesting festival because of the mix of comedy and music — it’s not something that happens a lot,” Christ said. “Half the people there were for all the Comedy Central stuff such as ‘Rick and Morty,’ and then the other half were there for the music. It didn’t clash but it was a unique environment.”

It’s been a week since Drake got booed off the stage at Tyler, the Creator’s wildly popular festival Camp Flog Gnaw and the (hip-hop) world is still asking: “Why?” 
The months leading up to the festival were riddled with mystery as to who the headliner would be. Despite some speculation that Frank Ocean would be the secret performer and a faux-Instagram ad confirming the suspicions, it turned out to be a hodgepodge: Drake, A$AP Rocky and Lil Uzi Vert. 
The popularity and variety of rappers presented weren’t enough to suffice the Frank Ocean theories, and Drake cut his set short following booing and low energy from the crowd. 
“I’m here for you tonight,” Drake said. “If you wanna keep going, I will keep going tonight. What’s up?” Then he paused, gauging the reaction of the crowd and was subsequently met with booing. “Well, look, it’s been love. I love y’all. I go by the name of Drake. Thank you for having me.”
The situation seems bizarre to anyone who’s followed Drake’s career, gone to a show or witnessed the virality of memes and jokes about the Canadian rapper. In early 2018, his label reported that he had become the first artist to reach more than 50 billion streams across music platforms and his career, populated with consecutive chart-topping hits, is evidence of his popularity. 
But when taking into consideration Tyler’s audience and Drake’s complicated history with likability and a continued trend of entitled fans, a world where Drake isn’t well-received makes sense. 
Camp Flog Gnaw specifically curates acts that generally reflect the personal taste of OFWGKTA’s founder Tyler, the Creator. Artists like Solange, The Internet, BROCKHAMPTON, Willow Smith and A$AP Rocky are typically on the bill, attracting the alt-R&B crowd, moshers and Odd Future fans. Think young “hipsters,” the types that shop at the Melrose Trading Post. This is where Drake sticks out. 
Aside from not being an alternative-leaning artist, he doesn’t have a cult following like KIDS SEE GHOSTS (Kanye and Kid Cudi) who performed at last year’s festival, nor is he a nostalgic favorite like Lil Wayne or Kelis. He was quite literally too famous for the crowd and not “on-brand” for an Odd Future festival. 
Tyler is one of many rappers who has developed a brand and cult identity to connect with fans. Everything he does is “off the beaten path,” sparking a hyper-loyal fanbase and a profitable career with Camp Flog Gnaw at the apex. Drake was simply situated outside of that identity, causing an averse crowd reaction. 
The incident is not only characterized by the aesthetic departure from Tyler’s brand, but represents festival culture as a whole. Drake getting booed at Camp Flog Gnaw is what happens when you hold R&B/hip-hop/rap festivals at $200 a ticket, exclusively in major cities like Los Angeles. They become too expensive and inaccessible, excluding a crowd that may have appreciated the mainstream hip-hop-leaning Drake. 
Tyler addressed his fans who booed in a series of tweets the next morning: 
“I thought bringing one of the biggest artists on the fucking planet to a music festival was fire!” he wrote. “But flipside, a lil tone deaf knowing the specific crowd it drew. Some created a narrative in their head and acted out like assholes when it didnt [sic] come true and I dont [sic] fuck with that.”
Furthermore, as the Washington Post’s Bethonie Butler explained, public opinion regarding Drake has paradoxically shifted both in favor and against the artist since his debut “Thank Me Later.” 
There’s continued sentiment that Drake is too mainstream and only makes radio hits. He’s been criticized for not having a classic album. Rapper Pusha T brought to light photos of Drake in blackface back in 2018 with his diss records “The Story of Adidon.”
And his romance with Rihanna has been picked apart by fans and the media after an awkward encounter between the two at the 2016 MTV VMA Awards and a collaboration with her ex who brutally assaulted her in 2009, Chris Brown.
Musically, some of Drake’s biggest hits are heavily influenced by styles that are far removed from the rapper. Think “One Dance” or “Nice For What,” and he’s been accused of being a “culture vulture.” He’s also known for latching on to up-and-coming artists like Summer Walker or Jorja Smith in try-hard attempts to stay in the public’s good graces.
There’s never been a moment where the entire musical community loved or hated Drake, and his humbling moment last week further characterizes him as a polarizing figure. 
To round out the reasons as to why Drake was booed at Camp Flog Gnaw, I think of the ways fans have become entitled to artists and their visibility. 
It’s the same behavior that causes people to criticize Summer Walker and her performances despite her social anxiety or to become upset when our favorite artists’ latest albums sound utterly different than we expected. 
In a world where music is not only a commodity but also a platform where we have semi-direct access to artists through social media, it’s easy to see the relationship between fans and artists as a transaction and not an experience. The members of the audience that booed Drake believed purchasing a $200-plus ticket to the festival ensured them a certain aesthetic that only Frank Ocean could fulfill. 
Drake’s appearance at Camp Flog Gnaw represented a rift between Tyler and his fans. He continued to be his “off-the-cuff” and unpredictable self but in a way that was too mainstream for the audience. 
At the end of the day, Drake will be OK. Ahead of the changing decade, he’s already been called the defining artist of the 2010s. 
As for the fans, it’s a lesson to remember that albums and performances are experiences, and the expectations we place on artists will continue to leave us disappointed. Regardless of whether Tyler’s choice was tone-deaf, no amount of money or cult following should leave an artist like Drake high and dry in front of thousands of people.

California is the hub of social justice movements and its universities the birthplace of progressivism and liberal values. However, a civil rights group has threatened to file a lawsuit against the very headquarters itself: the University of California. The reason? The university system requires applicants to submit a standardized test score, which, according to an Oct. 29 letter sent by the coalition of lawyers, is “not merely bad policy; it violates the California Constitution and antidiscrimination statutes, and is therefore legally and morally impermissible.”
The question of whether standardized testing is good policy is a separate matter entirely, and there are arguments to be made for both sides. In one of my previous columns published after the college admissions scandal became public, I argued that “rather than explaining why standardized testing is obsolete and painting an inaccurate picture of whether students are prepared for college, the recent scandals demonstrate the exact opposite: We need tests. But … we need to make them fair.” 
Rethinking standardized testing policy must come with the focus of making sure that students with wealthier backgrounds are unable to hire people to take tests for them, change answer sheets ex post facto or game the system by faking a learning disability to spend more time on the exams. The New York Times reports that high schools in the richest school districts have double the percentage of students with diagnosed learning disabilities than the national average and five times more than lower-income schools. 
But the merits of a lawsuit challenging the constitutionality of the exam itself are likely deficient. A large portion of the letter discusses why the tests are bad policy. But it is a novel legal argument to suggest that, because the test isn’t perfect and because the UC system knows it’s imperfect, it is automatically violating the civil rights of their applicants. However, the letter also makes three legal claims for why the exams are discriminatory, the first of which is “bias in exam conditions” against students with disabilities. This claim is questionable. Given that wealthy students are allegedly forging their own learning disabilities to gain an upper edge and receive better conditions for taking the test, it makes it unlikely that the conditions disfavor students with diagnosed learning disabilities.
The second and third claims — “bias in the exam” and there is “unequal access to exam preparation” — are even more obtuse. Using this logic, any exam with “word-heavy math problems” discriminates against non-English speakers and any exam that requires time and resources to study for would automatically be unconstitutional. 
How far do we extend this argument? Surely then accounting CPA examinations, which contain wordy math problems must be discriminatory in nature. State bar exams, as well as physician licensing exams, although they test a deep understanding of complicated subject matters, contain wordy English questions, which make them discriminatory. 
Even driver’s license 
behind-the-wheel tests would have to be abolished because wealthier student drivers have an advantage. In fact, every exam that requires time and potential monetary investment puts wealthier students at an advantage because they can afford to spend more time and to pay for extra resources to prepare for the exam. 
Irrespective of the potential lawsuit, the UC Academic Senate has been looking into standardized testing policy and is expected to issue a recommendation as to whether the UC should continue requiring these exam scores. 
If the UC system decides to change its test policy, it should be a decision it comes to themselves; it shouldn’t be forced to do so by a lawsuit with murky claims.

The Democratic party candidates are gearing up for their next debate later in the month. The Dec. 19 debate will take place not too far from USC, at Loyola Marymount University. 
The candidates have been stomping around the country for causes near and dear to their hearts such as gun control, abortion rights, and environmentalism, among others. Sprinkled between each debate have been CNN town halls. USC students took part in one regarding environmental concerns in September, posing questions and concerns to the candidates themselves. There was another debate in October on issues facing the LGBTQ community. 
Coupled with these town halls, the candidates have made indelible remarks regarding hot-button issues. All these social platforms that the candidates now stand on in regard to issues all would be dandy but only if the entire nation was filled with liberal Democrats and not in the midst of a culture war. If the Democrats continue to emphasize these social issues and vilify the exact people they need the most support from, President Donald Trump will win a second term. 
Sen. Elizabeth Warren, who many believe will be the Democratic candidate to battle Trump in the general election, has said that inmates are entitled to taxpayer-funded transgender surgery. This is a noble idea of human rights and can enliven a discussion on the topic of medical care, but it only appeals to those voters who are already in the pocket of the Democratic Party. Warren’s statement makes for a fantastic slogan and a great applause line but doesn’t really attract the evangelical Democrats living in the middle of the country and, thus, may need to be abandoned since to Warren is really only preaching to the choir. Other Democratic candidates have advocated for similar social justice goals, including Sen. Bernie Sanders who is advocating for the enfranchisement of the jailed. 
The Democratic Party had a lot to learn from the 2016 general election, especially the fact that voter alienation does not work in their favor. The states that led to Hillary Clinton’s defeat in 2016 were all states in the Rust Belt. Pennsylvania, Wisconsin and Michigan were all neglected by Clinton and subsequently won over by Trump. West Virginia, which has been dubbed “Trump Country,” is filled with citizens who work in the coal mines to barely make ends meet, and with Democrats pushing for intense environmental reforms, these coal miners have sought refuge in pro-coal Trump. 
Environmental concerns are justified, but the coal miners are not worried about the next 18 months when environmental issues may become worse. They’re worried about the end of this month when the bills are due. It is when candidates blame coal that the coal miners themselves feel that their livelihood and themselves are under attack. Therefore the candidates must have a gentler approach that is an actual invitation to coal workers to join the environmental movement. All four states are filled with blue-collar evangelical Christian voters who feel neglected by certain social policies. Considering how far left the Democratic Party has moved since 2016, it is hard to think that these voters will vote blue in 2019. 
College students have historically leaned left and have been known to protest for specific social causes. Political clubs at USC have butted heads with one another, as seen in particular with Trojan Advocates for Political Progress advocating for the suspension of conservative student organization Young Americans for Freedom. 
Additionally, the College Democrats and the Trojans for Warren have made their agenda clear: often advocating for the same social causes the Democratic Party sees as the most vital to the soul of the nation. As political as USC has become in the past presidential term, one may wonder why the University was not been tapped to host a Democratic debate. 
USC is ranked higher nationally than UCLA and Loyola Marymount according to Wall Street Journal/Times Higher Education 2020. The Trojans have the national standing and capacity to host a Democratic debate or even a general election debate. 
According to polling by The Wall Street Journal and NBC News, the percentage of white voters describing themselves as very liberal or liberal is roughly twice as large as the percentage of black voters who do so; a voting bloc the Democratic Party has relied upon heavily to win elections. Members of the Democratic Party who are not woke white liberals remain more committed to economic issues. 84% of Black Democrats view jobs and wages as “very important” opposed to the mere 64% of white Democrats who said so. These statistics blatantly show that the largest pack of Democratic voters care more of what’s in their wallets then what is happening outside of their wallets. 
Is it really going to be this hard to wrestle away a second term from Trump? It shouldn’t be. 
Democrats need an overarching message that unites the many members of their tribe into a firm coalition that can form a strong uprising against Trump. The party and the candidate, whoever they may be, must avoid the categorization of people into bubbles and appeal to already dedicated niches and pockets of the country. Without a well-rounded campaign, hatred for Trump will not be enough oil to fuel the Democratic machine.
