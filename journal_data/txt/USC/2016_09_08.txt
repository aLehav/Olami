Photo courtesy of Jameson HsuInsta-famous · Freshman Jameson Hsu, who has struggled with his body image, uses Instagram for his project, reDEFINE your BEAUTY.
In the first week of his freshman year, Jameson Hsu sat in the dorm room of fellow freshman Angel-Emilio Villegas describing an idea for a personal photography project. After struggling with body image issues and bulimia, Hsu, a freshman majoring in business of cinematic arts, wanted to spark a change in society to support everyday beauty. 
After a while, Hsu realized that he was looking at the first subject of his project. He asked permission to take Villegas’ portrait, and challenged him to think of what he considers beautiful. During the photoshoot, Villegas kept his answer in mind and allowed Hsu to photograph his idea of beauty. Two weeks ago, Hsu made the first post of a project that soon became a big part of his future. 
Hsu’s project, “reDEFINE your BEAUTY,” launched two weeks ago on his Instagram, @jameson_hsu. His goal for the project is to redefine beauty and allow people to take part in that process. Growing up, Hsu saw people in magazines and on the internet advertise a certain brand of unattainable beauty. This influence affected the way he saw himself and saw beauty. 
Hsu believes people should feel beautiful for who they are, which is something he wished he was able to do when he was younger. At 16, Hsu struggled to appreciate his own appearance. When compared to the media’s perception of the perfect body, he didn’t feel like he was good enough.
In high school, Hsu had a group of friends who he looked up to for their perfect bodies. He didn’t understand how they achieved this. Later that year, he found out from his friends that they were able to achieve their envious bodies through fasting. After learning this, he felt fat for eating all three meals of the day. 
He began to question if he could be good enough for society’s standards. In the spring of his sophomore year in high school, he looked in the mirror and felt ugly. He wasn’t happy with his identity. He didn’t see what he wanted. Instead he saw a fat, gay Asian man. He took the advice of his peers and began skipping meals and excessively exercising to achieve the body type he saw in the ads. In the morning, he slept through breakfast, forgetting the meal entirely. When he woke up, he exercised and rewarded himself with his first meal of the day. He was trying to achieve an impossible standard.
His routine escalated. He was fasting more often and eating less. He went through the entire day without eating a thing. However, the day would end in the kitchen, his feet flat on the cold floor and his hands grasping anything in his vicinity. He binge ate as much as he could. He binge ate until he couldn’t anymore and threw it all up. When it ended, he felt disgusted in himself. His memories of bulimia haunt him and continue to largely influence his mental stability.
“It contributes to my social anxiety [because] if I eat, I feel kind of fat and bloated,” he said. “There was this thing within me that, like, I would have to vomit, and not by force. My body would feel like it would instinctively have to.”
After sophomore year, Hsu got help from his high school therapist. He became more comfortable speaking about his struggles and understanding how his ideas of beauty are heavily adapted from the media. He was able to grow from his therapy sessions. Now that he is a freshman at USC, he is able to look back on his struggles with a new light. He now knows that he isn’t the only one who has struggled with body image. 
“When I think back to that moment, I kind of, I guess suppress it,” he said. “How could I have ever thought of myself in that light when there are so many people that will go through the same thing as me? I felt so helpless at the time, and I want to be the person that reaches that hand to someone who was like me in that point in time. I definitely think I’ve come a long way.”
Hsu said he wants this project to allow people to see true beauty, not the beauty they are told to embody. 
“No one should feel like they should be up to the unrealistic standards of what the media portrays,” Hsu said. “I want people to be able to accept themselves at any point of the day. There is not one way to be beautiful. Anyone should be able to feel like they can be in a beautiful picture if they want to.”
For this project, Hsu finds diverse people on campus to become part of his project. When looking for his next subject, he only looks for diversity. The person does not have to be part of USC. Hsu tries to get photos of people of all genders and ethnicities. Each day he approaches someone new and explains his project to them before asking permission to take their portrait. He will lead them to a new spot and ask them to pose naturally in a way that allows them to feel beautiful. He then starts snapping photo after photo until he achieves the one that perfectly showcases their beauty.
At the end of the photoshoot, he gives the person his social media information so that they can see the end result. He transfers the photos to his phone, then uploads them to Instagram, only editing for saturation and brightness. In the description of each photo is a quote from the person about their own definition of beauty. 
When he first started the project, Hsu struggled to find a way to fix the problems of beauty standards that he saw in society. He knew he wanted to be the one to spark a change, but didn’t know where to start. He knew he couldn’t reverse the media’s ideology on beauty and change the fact that advertisements that surround us everyday promote unattainable standards for how people should look. Instead, he decided to make use of what he had. This past summer, he came up with the idea to make use of his social media platform and use it to showcase his project. 
For the project, Hsu wanted to make a practical use of photography that would alleviate this problem in society. In mainstream photography, he saw conventionally beautiful people showcased for the public, but he wanted to change that. He didn’t want people to think that only people who looked a certain way could be showcased in a photograph; anyone can be beautiful — they just need to be normalized in media.
“By taking a picture in that moment without letting that person prepare, they are able to accept themselves at any point of the day,” he said. “There is not one way to be beautiful.”
The response to the project has been overwhelmingly positive. People on social media have loved the photographs, the description and the project itself. 
“It’s spreading a really positive aspect on life and people,” said Skyy Rouse, a freshman majoring in accounting and one of the students featured in Hsu’s project. “He wants to get a wide range of people to portray society as a whole. This is something anyone can look forward to and relate with.” 
Hsu wants to continue this project for as long as he can. However, he is unsure where it will go. If he gains enough popularity, he is planning to make a separate Instagram account for the project, or make a Facebook page. Hsu does know that he wants to keep the project online. He wants to keep it virtual so it may be accessible to anyone. Hsu worries that if he were to bring it to an art gallery, only people interested in the subject of beauty would be able to see the project. By keeping it online, anyone can come across it. 
Hsu hopes that people of different backgrounds are able to see his project and hopes to have an influence on someone’s life. He wants his project to let people know they are beautiful the way they are and to help those struggling with eating disorders and body image issues the same way he did. He wants them to appreciate their everyday beauty. 
“You are you all day,” Hsu said. “And you shouldn’t have to feel like there is only one way to be accepted as beautiful.”

Jessica Zhou | Daily TrojanChampionship drive · Junior utility James Walters and the No. 2 Trojans have three games this weekend, including one home game.
After sweeping their first pair of home games, the No. 2 men’s water polo team returns to the pool this weekend for not one, not two but three games on Saturday and Sunday, facing No. 6 UCSB at home Saturday morning then traveling inland to take on La Verne and Whittier on Sunday. 
The Gauchos are undefeated on the year as well as having won two games last weekend. The first was an 18-3 victory over Pomona-Pitzer and the second a 20-11 win over No. 15 Air Force.
Whittier (3-0) is also having a hot start to their season, having swept the Whittier Open last weekend.
La Verne (1-1) is coming off of a 16-14 overtime win against Fresno Pacific after losing their first game of the season. 
USC fired away against UC Irvine with nine Trojans tallying goals for the 14-3 victory. The clash against the Anteaters highlighted the Trojan’s depth with three freshmen scoring their first career goals as Trojans. Freshman drivers Marin Dasic and Thomas Dunstan and redshirt freshmen Daniel Leong each tallied goals for the 9-1 lead at the half with a pair from Leong. 
Returning Trojans made waves as well with junior utility Mihajlo Milicevic leading the way with 3 goals making him top scorer of the game. On defense, junior goalie and 2016 Olympian McQuin Baron rounded up eight saves.
The Trojans kept the ball rolling into the second game of the weekend against No. 17 Cal Baptist. On defense, senior driver Nick Bell swept away five steals to keep the Cal Baptist offense at bay. Bell, along with redshirt freshman Sam Slobodien, junior driver Matteo Morrelli and redshirt junior Mitch Embrey, each contributed goals to the final victory of 16-3, with hat tricks from Bell, Morrelli and Embrey. 
“We’re looking to maintain our focus for this weekend’s games. As always, our main focus is defense, trying to shut down their main shooters,” junior utility James Walters said. 
With incredible depth and international talent, the Trojans are looking for an even more historic season than the last. It’s no secret the legacy of USC men’s water polo has made it’s mark on collegiate sports, with NCAA Coach of the Century and USC men’s and women’s water polo head coach Jovan Vavic looking for his 500th men’s program win this season. Currently at 496 wins, the earliest the Trojans can nab the historic victory is against MPSF rival Stanford Sept. 17. 
“The freshmen are very talented and immediately have been a big help to our team,” junior driver Blake Edwards said. “It’s exciting to watch them grow, and I think we’re going to be a really competitive, dangerous team this year.” 
Edwards was the Trojans leading scorer last season. He was joined as a top-goal scorer by his brother Lachlan Edwards. The Edwards brothers are part of a top-notch junior class for the Men of Troy.
USC will square off against UCSB at 9 a.m. at the Uytengsu Aquatic Center this Saturday at home before facing off against La Verne and Whittier in the Inland Empire Classic at 10:20 a.m. and 1:20 p.m., respectively, on Sunday.

The USC football team and its opponent this Saturday, the Utah State Aggies, are two programs coming off of completely different opening weeks of play.
USC just suffered the largest season-opening loss in school history last week, falling to No. 1 Alabama, 52-6. Meanwhile, the Aggies enter the Coliseum coming off of a 45-6 victory over Weber State last week. 
While Utah State is considered one of the easier games in USC’s gauntlet of a regular season schedule, the Trojans should be prepared for a gritty battle against the Aggies. In its overall series against Utah State, USC has defeated the Aggies by an average margin of victory of 37 points. However, in the 2013 season, a Cody Kessler and Marqise Lee-led USC squad escaped its matchup with Utah State with a narrow 17-14 victory. 
Following the debacle that was week one against the Tide, there are several key areas of improvement and execution which the Trojans must hone in on for this week’s contest with Utah State, including:
USC’S OFFENSIVE LINE NEEDS TO REBOUND
Entering the 2016 season, USC’s experienced offensive line was projected to be one of its stronger assets. 
With a new starting quarterback behind it, the USC offensive line failed to contain an aggressive Alabama pass rush on multiple occasions last week. Redshirt junior quarterback Max Browne was hit and hurried continually against the Tide and sacked three times. 
While the line’s struggles were a collective effort, much of the Trojans troubles up front came at the tackle positions. Redshirt senior tackle Zach Banner — who is considered a possible first-round pick in next year’s NFL Draft — struggled as he surrendered a sack, a quarterback hit and four quarterback hurries individually. On the opposite side, sophomore tackle Chuma Edoga — starting in place of injured redshirt senior tackle Chad Wheeler — had his shortcomings as well, missing blocking assignments on several occasions. 
Run-blocking was also an issue for this offensive line, especially early on. USC only managed to muster six rushing yards in the first half of last week’s loss to Alabama. 
This veteran line needs to rebound and affirm the national acclaim it was receiving in this preseason. 
ESTABLISH THE RUN 
Last week, the Trojans were held to 64 rushing yards on a total of 30 attempts — an average of 2.1 yards per rush. Keep in mind that 46 of these 64 yards on the ground came on one run — a 46-yard rush from sophomore running back Ronald Jones in the third quarter. 
Throughout Fall Camp, offensive coordinator Tee Martin and head coach Clay Helton preached that they would set up their offensive passing attack through an effective rushing scheme, though much of last week’s problematic run effectiveness can be credited to the offensive line.
With highly touted running backs such as senior Justin Davis and Jones sharing the backfield, USC has all the potential to excel on the ground. Davis and Jones — who combined for over 1800 yards on the ground last season — must put on a solid performance Saturday to secure a win over the Aggies. 
STOUT DEFENSIVE LINE PLAY
The Trojans are facing a Utah State team who rushed for 428 yards in its win over Weber State last week. Aggie senior running back Devante Mays rushed for 208 yards and three touchdowns in the victory. 
While he only tallied two tackles on the stat sheet last week against Alabama, redshirt senior nose tackle Stevie Tu’ikolovatu was a solid anchor at the line of scrimmage — filling up gaps and occupying blockers. Sophomore defensive tackles Rasheem Green and Noah Jefferson will need to aid Tu’ikolovatu in his run-stuffing duties up front on Saturday. 
The play of this Trojan defensive line will be pivotal in USC’s containment of Utah State’s rushing attack. 
BROWNE MUST TAKE CONTROL
This Saturday will be a prime opportunity for Browne to take control of the Trojan offense and to affirm Helton’s decision to name him the starting quarterback. 
Browne was relentlessly harassed by the Alabama defense last week and was prevented from getting the ball to USC’s plethora of playmakers on offense. He was held to just 101 yards through the air on 14-of-29 passing, also throwing an interception which was returned for an Alabama touchdown in the second quarter. 
After splitting snaps with redshirt freshman quarterback Sam Darnold in the second half last week, Browne needs to lead this Trojan offense to a productive performance on Saturday to solidify himself as the starter. 
ESTABLISH THE EDGES
When Clancy Pendergast was named the defensive coordinator for USC this season, many anticipated an aggressive defensive scheme from the Trojans. Pendergast’s “5-2” defensive scheme revolves around edge-rushers who can put pressure on opposing offensive backfields. 
Last week, junior linebacker Uchenna Nwosu and sophomore defensive end Porter Gustin failed to penetrate the Alabama backfield consistently. While Gustin did record a rather quiet  nine tackles, Nwosu recorded only one tackle against the Tide. 
Gustin and Nwosu’s ability to establish a forceful rush off the edge this week will be crucial in preventing Utah State’s successful running of the ball.

Brian Chin | Daily TrojanRockin’ Rogers · Senior wide receiver Darreus Rogers and the Trojans face a tough and confident Utah State team. The Aggies are coming off a 45-6 season opening victory against Weber State last weekend.
In the wake of a disappointing season-opening loss to Alabama, the football team can’t afford to view Saturday’s game against Utah State as a guaranteed bounce back. If they are taken lightly, this dangerous Aggie football team could hand USC its first 0-2 start since 1997. 
Over the past six or so years, Utah State has been quietly living in its golden age. After appearing in just five bowl games over the course of 51 years, the Aggies have participated in a bowl game each year since 2011. The program has become a type of stepping stone in the process. Former head coach Gary Anderson landed bigger jobs at Wisconsin and now Oregon State because of his successes at Utah State. Linebacker Bobby Wagner (2008-2011) used his time with the Aggies as a platform to become a Super Bowl champion two-time Pro-Bowler with the Seattle Seahawks. Despite never cracking the top 80 in recruiting class ranking since 2011, according to Rivals, the Aggies continuously maximize their talent, allowing them to capture a 2012 conference championship and three 9-plus win seasons. The bottom line: Utah State has been playing high-level football for a while now, and it tends to not shy away from the moment. 
Utah State, though, plays much lesser competition in the Mountain West Conference, which is weaker than the Pac-12. Despite this, the Aggies have developed a reputation as a giant killer. Since 2009, they either defeated or lost by less than two touchdowns to eight ranked opponents (they were victorious as the underdog on four of those occasions). Utah State has proven that it can hang with the Oklahomas and Auburns of the world. In fact, the Aggies showed that they belong in the same stadium as USC just a few years ago, when the Trojans beat them by a mere field goal in 2013.
Hail Marys, blocked field goals and trick plays. Normally, these are the big plays required to complete a major upset in college football. The scary part of Utah State’s game is that it doesn’t need any of these to be victorious. Instead, the Aggies can just run the ball down opponent’s throats. One week into the season, and Utah State is already tied for first in the nation in rushing yards with 428. A depleted USC defensive line that gave up 5.4 yards per rush to Alabama may not have a chance to catch its breath this weekend. Utah State possesses a star running back in Devante Mays who ran for 208 yards and 3 touchdowns against Weber State on opening weekend.
In addition to Mays, efficient quarterback Kent Myers can accumulate his fair share of yardage on the ground, as well as catch defenses off balance through the play action. Winning the line of scrimmage will be key for USC, as Utah State’s read option style of play is very similar to what Lane Kiffin dialed up with Alabama freshman quarterback Jalen Hurts in Dallas.
Utah State does not seem like a Stanford or a Notre Dame or an Oregon. Yet, if the Trojans are going to bounce back from the Alabama loss and contend for a Pac-12 Championship, handling Utah State in convincing fashion will be imperative. The time is now for Clay Helton’s squad to play up to their potential, and Utah State may not give them a choice.

Tal Volk | Daily TrojanDown for the count · Junior center Toa Lobendahn suffered a torn ACL and MCL in the season opening game against Alabama last Saturday. He will be replaced by experienced redshirt junior center Nico Falah.
Following Thursday’s practice at Howard-Jones Field, USC football head coach Clay Helton announced that junior center Toa Lobendahn had suffered an ACL and MCL tear — thus ending his 2016 season. 
“It’s very sad news for us,” Helton said. “[Lobendahn’s] one of the loves of my life … he will be missed greatly.”
Doctors discovered an MCL tear earlier in the week, then proceeded to find the ACL tear following more observations, said Helton. 
Lobendahn suffered the injury during last week’s season-opener against No. 1 Alabama. On a fourth-and-7 play early in the first quarter, Alabama linebacker Ryan Anderson fell on Lobendahn’s knee following a sack — likely aggravating the injury. Lobendahn would remain in the contest until the end of the game. 
“The warrior that he is, didn’t even complain about it,” Helton said. “Came off the field after the game and said [to the coaches], ‘my knee doesn’t feel right.’”
Lobendahn has a history with knee injuries. This is the second consecutive season that a torn ACL has derailed Lobendahn’s season. He missed the final seven games of the season after injuring his knee in the Utah game. 
Lobendahn has a history with knee injuries. A previous ACL tear prevented him from playing over half of the 2015 season. 
Replacing Lobendahn is redshirt junior Nico Falah. With several injuries at the center position last season, Falah stepped into the role in 2015 to close out the season. 
“[Falah has] been in this position before. He did a great job for us last year down the latter half of the season,” Helton said. “I have all the confidence in the world in [Falah] … He’s a veteran — a redshirt junior — who has been out here every single day at practice working his tail off just for this opportunity.”
Helton said Lobendahn has already undergone surgery and that the junior will use a redshirt year. 
Falah is an offensive tackle who can also play center. His lone career start came in the Pac-12 championship game last season against Stanford. 
Helton said that redshirt freshman Cole Smith will serve as Falah’s backup, and redshirt sophomore Chris Brown could play center in an emergency.

Let me count the ways: have two players embroil themselves in rape investigations and a third suspended for stomping on an opponent’s groin, have your best player get into a fight and walk out of practice, lose your starting center for the season and drop out of the AP Top 25 at the earliest point of a season in a non-sanction year since 1993 — all on the heels of a historically devastating 46-point drubbing to No. 1 Alabama following months of preparation.
Welcome to USC football in 2016, where the only silver lining in losing to Alabama is perhaps that Los Angeles is not located in the state of Alabama.
Few experts predicted that the Trojans would upset the Crimson Tide, but the hope was that the game would be competitive, that an 0-1 record would not look too bad if USC at least made Alabama head coach Nick Saban’s powerhouse work hard for the win. The Trojans did that for about 12 minutes, and then it was like the Crimson Tide reached the apex of the world’s longest roller coaster and simply glided down for the next three quarters.
Nearly everything that could go wrong did go wrong. Head coach Clay Helton, who has had three consecutive chances to make a strong impression in big games with the USC faithful, is 0-3 to start his head coaching career, with losses in the Pac-12 Championship Game, the Holiday Bowl and now this debacle. His quarterback pick, redshirt junior Max Browne, had a primetime stage for his debut and put up a bland performance. When Helton turned to Sam Darnold, hoping for a flash in the pan, the redshirt freshman responded with uninspiring three-and-outs.
The list goes on. Junior wide receiver JuJu Smith-Schuster, one of the top wideouts in the country, had just one catch. The offensive line, vaunted as one of the most experienced in the country, was manhandled by the Alabama defense. According to Pro Football Focus, USC’s entire offensive line received a grand total of one positively graded run block in the entire first half. You read that right — one. 
The run game, which we were promised would be a staple of the offense, was limited to 2.1 yards per carry and just 64 yards in all. The defense, after a strong start, wound up being shredded apart, missing coverages, leaving receivers wide open and allowing long runs — all with a true freshman quarterback under center for Alabama for much of the game. And we haven’t even talked about Lane Kiffin (whose Twitter game is elite) or Steve Sarkisian (who must be the happiest newly-employed man on the face of the earth).
Even the most ardent of supporters would be hard-pressed to sugarcoat this loss. When both the head coach and athletic director come out and say that one loss doesn’t define who they are, you know they’ve run out of silver linings because there are really just two positives: It’s only been a week, and the next opponent is not Alabama.
Instead, it is Utah State of the Mountain West Conference. This is a home game against a relatively unknown team, kicking off at 11 a.m. and airing on the Pac-12 Network. Finally, USC can show what it is capable of while under a hundred times less pressure than its season opener — and it better.
The Trojans need to do to the Aggies what the Crimson Tide did to them. They’re “only” 16-point favorites to beat Utah State, but a 16-point win might not even cut it on Saturday.
“We’ve got a mad football team right now,” Helton said after a spirited practice on Tuesday. “I wish we could play today to be honest with you.”
USC has to channel the pent-up anger from its opening night humiliation and let it out — all of it. This is Browne’s time to shine, air a few balls downfield and prove that he deserved to be a top recruit and the rightful heir to Cody Kessler. This is Smith-Schuster’s time to have his typical monster game, rack up 100 yards or more and get reacquainted with the offense. This is the time for the featured running backs — sophomore Ronald Jones II and senior Justin Davis — to be the imposing presence they were supposed to be, for the offensive line to play up to its experience and for the defense to shore up its mistakes.
Essentially, this is the time for the Trojans to show who they are. This is an immensely talented team that boasts some of the most gifted players in the Pac-12. They are clearly better than their week one performance, but first they need the confidence to know that for a fact. Scoring a touchdown and getting Helton his first win as a head coach would be a good start. 
Utah State is not going to simply roll over, but it is far and away the weakest opponent on USC’s unforgivable schedule. This is the Trojans’ only chance to work out their many kinks before the road gets harder and harder (have I mentioned they play Stanford on the road in eight days?).
It is imperative that USC stretches the margin of victory over Utah State as much as possible. That way, perhaps the echo of Lane Kiffin’s laugh won’t be too loud on the flight up to Stanford.

The football team needs a head coach with head coaching experience.  Awarding a 5 year contract to a novice was laughable.  You reap what you sow.

Brian Chin | Daily TrojanHome cookin’ · Redshirt junior quarterback Max Browne starts his first game in the Coliseum against Utah State on Saturday at 11 a.m.
USC will face the unranked Utah State Aggies on Saturday, a team the Trojans will struggle with if they fail to adequately prepare and focus on the game.
The Aggies (1-0), of the Mountain West Conference, are coming off a season opener in which they handed Weber State a decisive loss, defeating them 45-6 at home. This is Utah State’s first road game. History is on USC’s side as they are 5-0 in their matchups against Utah State, but the Aggies had some spectacular performances last week that the Trojans (0-1) are preparing for.
Utah State had dominating displays from their running backs, specifically senior Devante Mays who rushed for 208 yards on 18 carries and scored 3 touchdowns. He earned honorable mention honors for the National Player of the Week. USC’s defense will have to step up as sophomore defensive tackle Noah Jefferson is still listed as questionable for Saturday’s game following a shoulder sprain. 
Part of the defensive line’s play will be determined by graduate transfer nose tackle Stevie Tu’ikolovatu, who head coach Clay Helton described as a key component in holding up the point.
Sophomore inside linebacker Cam Smith was in good form, recording nine tackles against Alabama in his first game back since tearing his ACL in November.
“The main thing I saw was we shot ourselves in the foot a lot,” Smith said. “When they had those big plays, that was the main thing. We have a lot to look forward to, but there’s definitely some things to work on.”
Alabama had 242 rushing yards, including 32 from freshman quarterback Jalen Hurts. Utah State has a dynamic dual-threat quarterback in junior Kent Myers who earned honorable mention All-Mountain West honors last season. Against Weber State, Myers rushed for 53 yards and threw for 100 yards on 11-17 passing.
“I expect him to run a lot,” Smith said. “He’s going to scramble and make anything he can get. He likes to use his feet, so I’m expecting that a lot.”
Myers was one of five Aggies who rushed for 50 or more yards against Weber State.
On the offensive side of the ball, the Trojans will have to deal with an Aggie defense with a strong linebacker corps including senior Leki Uasike and junior Alex Huerta who recorded nine and seven tackles, respectively.
USC has not scored a touchdown yet this season due in part to Alabama’s defensive decision to take away junior wide receiver JuJu Smith-Schuster.
“If that’s the case, let’s make [senior wide receiver] Darreus Rogers a household name,” said redshirt junior quarterback Max Browne. “We had flashes of that last week I think, but at the end of the day it’s not just like we’re going to forget about [JuJu].”
Rogers and Smith-Schuster are part of a highly touted wide receiving corps, but Browne acknowledged that he must do a better job of locating and connecting with his receivers.
“You have to connect on those in all three phases: offensive line, my play and then receivers down field,” Browne said.
The offensive line has been one of the most highly criticized groups after a poor performance against Alabama, and now the line will be without starting junior center Toa Lobendahn who suffered a torn ACL.  Helton said missed assignments and a lack of physicality were the two main flaws that the offensive line was working on fixing ahead of Saturday’s game.
In addition to protecting Browne, the offensive line will see snaps from redshirt freshman quarterback Sam Darnold. Helton reaffirmed that he will use Darnold in certain red zone situations and in short yard opportunities.
The game is set for an 11 a.m. kickoff and is the earliest home game that the Trojans have played in the Coliseum since the early 1950s. It will be televised on the Pac-12 Network.

My first college party was a complete mess. Coming to college from Australia, I had no idea what a “frat” was. At 18, most of us had under-aged partied ourselves out by 15. So, here I was at my first college party, having an absolutely awesome time. During the first month of school, everything was really new, and I made many friendships with people of different backgrounds. “College was a great, innocent environment!” or so I thought at the time.
 I was happily chilling by the entrance to this frat party when this girl came up to me and asked, “Hey boy, do you wanna dance?”
 “Of course,” I replied excitedly. “I love dancing.”
 She turned around and abruptly took my hand, guiding me through the busy room. “Oh, how nice of her to hold my hand. This must be an American thing,” I thought to myself. These people are so friendly and nice.
 I was so naïve. Before I knew it, I was backed up against the wall — cornered in this college frat party, a posterior anchored to my groin. What’s going on? This is not what I meant by dancing!
 My fraternity brothers came over to the hot mess that I was, pinned to the wall with a behind pushing against me as it continually stepped on this infamous gas pedal. I waved my arms at my saviors, but rather than grab my hand and pull me out, they cheered me on and high-fived me instead.
 “Ayyyyyy Sammy the Aussie — get it, mate!” he said.
 One-sided grinding. Definitely not a fun time.
 Now, as an upperclassman, I thought that the days of awkward one-sided grinding at frat parties were way behind me. However, as I look deeper into my life as a Trojan, I have begun to notice myself and so many other Trojans continuing to engage in this one-sided grind on other people. Yes, people have been caught grinding in the new Marshall building.
 My eyes were burned after being a witness of this. I’m just kidding; I don’t mean it literally. When I say that I see people still one-sided grinding, I mean that I see people at USC engaging in the spirit of the one-sided grind, which is the act of offering friendship or time or effort for people who do not feel the same way.
 It takes two to tango — well, for the purposes of this metaphor — grind. However, USC is filled with one-sided grinders! From the days we have set foot on this campus, we have been indoctrinated with this network is the best work dogma of USC. “USC’s not about the grades you make, but it’s about the hands you shake,” I’ve been told time and time again. I think that this make-all-the-friends-you-can is applicable to a lot of colleges, but I think that particularly at USC, it’s even more prevalent.
 The symptoms of a one-sided grinder are far and wide. To list a few: bumping into people and saying goodbye to them with “Oh my gosh, I’ve missed you so much, we have to catch up,” followed by no follow-up because you’ve said the same thing to seven other people today and you forgot who you’ve said it to; forgetting names instantly because you have insufficient processing memory; smiling at strangers, not because you’re nice, but because you can’t remember all the friends you’ve made; and my personal favorite, the pigeon head twitch you have going for you as you try to process all the familiar faces in a crowded area like TCC.
 For a lot of us, we’re just trying to make too many friends!
 Now don’t get me wrong. Making friends is awesome. We definitely need to put love out into the world and provide positive vibes. This is not a call to selfishness and only caring for our own. However, this is a call to moderation in a college environment where many people overextend themselves. It truly breaks my heart to meet and hear stories of USC alumni that feel like they cast their nets so wide during their time at USC that the “fish” (read: friends) they were trying to catch slipped through the netting.
 It can be so easy for society (read: frat bros) to pressure us to remain in uncomfortable situations (read: grinding with someone you don’t want to grind with). But it doesn’t have to be this way. If we were a little more intentional to set aside some time to invest and pour into genuine, close friendships with the people we care about. Grind with the people you know want to grind. No more one-sided grinding, please.

Since 1966, Gemini G.E.L. in Los Angeles has served as a center of invention and creativity in the world of printmaking, producing groundbreaking works of prints highly sought after by art lovers. For Gemini’s 50th anniversary, the Los Angeles County Museum of Art is collaborating with Gemini as well as the National Gallery of Art to put up The Serial Impulse at Gemini G.E.L. exhibition at LACMA. 
Many of the works displayed have rarely been seen in their entirety, so this exhibition will allow visitors to appreciate serial works as a whole. The exhibit will celebrate the accomplishments of Gemini G.E.L. in the past half century as well as acknowledge its influence in the world of art.
Gemini G.E.L. was founded in 1966 by USC alumni Sidney B. Felsen and Stanley Grinstein, along with Kenneth Tyler and co-owners Elyse Grinstein and Rosamund Felsen. While they started out with only a lithography studio, Gemini G.E.L. soon expanded to working with etching, screen printing and woodcut printing, as well as any three dimensional materials the artists desired at the time. Gemini has worked with over 70 artists over the course of 50 years and is known for keeping artists in workshops for long periods of times.
Visitors of LACMA will have the chance to view The Serial Impulse at Gemini G.E.L from Sept. 11, 2016 to Jan. 2, 2017. The exhibit will consist of 17 complete series of serial works by different artists. The time period of the works range from as early as 1966 with Josef Albers’ series “White Line Squares” to Julie Mehretu’s “Myriads, Only by Dark” in 2014. Other prominent series’ that will also be shown in the exhibit include works by Jasper Johns, Robert Rauschenberg, Frank Stella, Ed Ruscha, Richard Serra, John Baldessari and many more.
According to Michael Govan, CEO of LACMA, Gemini “remains a highly influential and pioneering workshop” for artists around the country. “Pivotal works produced at Gemini have been integral to the museum’s permanent collection, monographic exhibitions and programs,” Govan said. 
Felsen proudly claims that Gemini has “always told the artists they can work in any medium or combination of media they chose, and they are encouraged to experiment as much as needed.”
Because of Gemini’s constant drive for new innovations in the printmaking scene, the process of creating even different sections of the same series varies. With styles ranging from lithography to etching to woodblock printing, what seems like one simple design can take days or even weeks to create. Richard Serra’s all black pieces require different copper plates put in acid baths for days before it could even be etched with the gritty textured material that his pieces often have. Julie Mehretu’s giant prints go through extra- large presses and multiple trials before it turns out the way it does. Every piece of artwork requires unique attention and skills, but that is precisely what makes Gemini G.E.L. one of the most sought-after printmaking workshops in the country.
The Serial Impulse at Gemini G.E.L. will provide a special opportunity to appreciate not only the work of Gemini G.E.L., but also the legacy of USC alumni.

Photo courtest of USC Thornton School of MusicSymphonic masterpiece · In a collaboration with Visions & Voices, the Thornton Symphony will perform on Friday at 7:30 p.m. in Bovard Auditorium. The performance will be led by renowned conductor Carl St. Clair.
The USC Thornton’s Symphony ensemble will explore concepts of fate and freedom in an unforgettable performance Friday of Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky’s “Symphony No. 4 in F minor, Op. 36,” Giuseppe Verdi’s “La forza del destino” and Gustav Mahler’s “Ich bin der welt abhanden gekommen.”
 The symphony will be led by conductor Carl St. Clair, artistic leader and principal conductor of the Thornton orchestras. St. Clair has worked with Thornton for over 20 years teaching and conducting, and knows how to get the most out of his musicians.
 “[Our] challenges would have to be trying to convey the composer’s interpretations with the best of our ability,” said Sydney Mariano, a sophomore studying violin performance. “We’ve never experienced anything as dark and as disheartening compared to what many of these composers have faced, so we really hope to get the most genuine and real interpretation in our performance. [St. Clair]’s amazing because he helps us grow musically by putting these pieces into context, briefing us about the lives of the composers and about what they had been going through during the time.” 
The night mainly centers on Tchaikovsky’s piece, “Symphony No. 4 in F minor, Op. 36,” though all of the compositions being performed are centered around the themes of fate and freedom, yet Tchaikovsky’s piece is perhaps the most well known. Throughout his life, composer Tchaikovsky faced many dark issues, including a struggling marriage, blackmail, depression, an oppressed sexuality and financial issues.
 His fourth symphony, composed in 1877, came about after facing many personal troubles when he was teaching at the Moscow Conservatory. While dealing with the acceptance of his own sexuality, one of his students proclaimed her love for Tchaikovsky and even threatened to kill herself if they could not be together.
 The two married, but Tchaikovsky attempted suicide and fled to Switzerland and then Italy, where he then finished his fourth symphony. Tchaikovsky’s emotions and internal struggles can be heard throughout the piece.
“There is not a single line in my symphony which I have not felt deeply, and which does not echo true and sincere emotions,” Tchaikovsky once wrote.
 The night will also feature actors that will be reading Tchaikovsky’s program notes, which he wrote to a friend explaining the piece, as well as other correspondences between Tchaikovsky and Madame von Meck in which he frequently mentions themes of fate, adding to the mesmerizing nature of the performance. An RSVP is required for the event on the Visions and Voices website.
The performance is at 7:30 p.m. Friday in Bovard Auditorium.

Photo courtesy of USC Roski School of Art and DesignColor your world · Manifest Destiny is senior Michael Chang’s upcoming exhibition. His work focuses on the future of Los Angeles and the potential ramifications of the city’s current social tensions.
Michael Chang, a senior majoring in fine arts, became animated when he discussed the conception of Re: Manifest Destiny, his upcoming art exhibition. It focuses on the future of Los Angeles and the potential ramifications of the city’s current social tensions. 
“You can drive for five minutes and you’re in Hancock Park, and the next minute you’re in Koreatown,” Chang said. “It’s like, where did all the f-cking trees go, right?” 
The exhibit opens Monday at the Helen Lindhurst Fine Arts Gallery in Watt Hall. Chang collaborated with filmmaker Aaron Ashby and artist Laura Kg on portions of the show.
 In Re: Manifest Destiny, Chang will present a set of paintings, collages, graphics and prints that depict a dystopian Los Angeles in the year 2037. The pieces imagine a hypersegregated Los Angeles in which physical walls separate racial neighborhoods and the infrastructure intended to bring the city together instead enforce division. A multicultural revolutionary group forms in protest of segregation and a set of pieces memorialize their efforts.
 The multimedia exhibition is named after a term used to describe the aggressive expansion of United States territory into the American West during the 19th century. Chang saw parallels between the social dynamics of Los Angeles today and what played out in California during the period of westward expansion. He cited gentrification of minority neighborhoods, appropriation of native and local cultures and an education system that threatens marginalized identities as concerns that he hopes to address in his artwork.
 “Looking back on my time in public education, it was really skewed toward one perspective, which is the white, heteronormative male perspective,” Chang said.
 Chang told a story from his middle school California history class. The public school’s standard textbook said that the Chinese immigrants who constructed the transcontinental railroad during the 1860s were “hardworking, obedient and never complained.” At the time, Chang felt proud of his Chinese heritage, but looking back, he reflects that those sorts of classroom experiences pressured him into accepting Orientalist stereotypes that portray Chinese people as a subservient model minority.
Chang believes that the origin of the social and racial tension in Los Angeles is past racist legislation in policymaking. He named post-WWII highway construction, which disrupted minority communities in East Los Angeles, and redlining, the practice of companies denying home loans and insurance to those living in poor areas.
 “[These decisions] are still affecting how all these different enclaves that we have in Los Angeles are existing,” Chang said.
 He pointed that chain link fences, tall hedges and metal fencing like that surrounding the USC campus were all segregating devices created in response to racist and classist fears.
 Re: Manifest Destiny is a collection of speculative work meant to interrogate all of these phenomena while maintaining a focus on the future — and the potential consequences of inaction.
 Chang recognized that his art may express a perspective that not all visitors will agree with, but hopes that they will come with an open mind.
 “[The project] is just a measured response to everything that’s been happening, especially this summer,” he said. Through his project, Chang hopes to overcome a polarized political climate that has affected the way people communicate about their disagreements.
 In the future, Chang hopes to continue building the world of Re: Manifest Destiny and explore it using 3-D mediums such as performance art. He also mentioned an interest in cults, which he argues can take religious, sociopolitical and even racial forms. Chang expressed mixed emotions regarding his own Asian-American identity and the failure of the Asian-American community to receive South Asians, Southeast Asians and others outside the economically powerful triangle formed by China, South Korea and Japan.
 Re: Manifest Destiny is a thoughtful, future-oriented project that challenges visitors to be proactive in averting the dystopia Chang presents. The exhibit will run from Sept. 12 to 22 at the Lindhurst Fine Arts Gallery in Watt Hall.

Three academics explored the dichotomy between religion and faith Thursday at “The Great Divide: Faith and Politics in America Today,” hosted by the USC Caruso Catholic Center and the Institute for Advanced Catholic Studies.
The event is the fourth in the “Race, Faith and Violence” series, which examines the intersection of three major religions, Judaism, Christianity and Islam, and the current political and cultural climate. Varun Soni, dean of religious life, moderated the event, which focused on the divide between religion and politics, and how different faiths can work together to surmount it.
The panel featured Rabbi Reuven Firestone, a Regenstein professor in medieval Judaism as well as a member of the School of Religion faculty; Amir Hussain, a professor of Islam and world religions at Loyola Marymount University; and Pim Valkenberg, professor of religion and culture at the Catholic University of America.
The event began with an introduction by former U.S. ambassador, author and professor of constitutional law Doug Kmiec, who spoke about the intimate relationship between politics and religion in the United States, and how the freedom to practice religion independent of government interference is a gift that the Founders of the United States passed on down to future generations.
“The Founders gave us a nation that had a preference for freedom and had a special preference for freedom of conscience and freedom of religion,” Kmiec said.
Kmiec asked the panelists to discuss how each of their faiths has helped build American culture and how Americans can work together to build a joint culture rather than tear down each other’s traditions. 
Hussain discussed the experience of Muslims in America, especially after 9/11 and the anti-Sharia laws and anti-Muslim feelings it evoked, and how it defeated the promises that this country stands for. He also touched on issues of what it means to be a patriot, and whether that definition of patriotism includes someone like Colin Kaepernick, the professional football quarterback standing up in the face of perceived injustice and making a statement.
Firestone spoke about the divides that are embedded in American culture, such as the prejudice against Judaism evident in many pieces of literature, music and folktales. This lead to an increase in anti-Semitic crimes, despite Jews being well represented in the highest tiers of American society, according to Firestone. Firestone and the rest of the panel believed that if we acknowledge these prejudices and are able to talk about them in discussions and symposiums like this one, this will be the first step in solving such divides in our society.
Events such as this one are paramount to making USC a more accepting and forward thinking campus, according to Samuel Paul, executive director for the Institute for Advanced Catholic Studies. 
“The importance is to be able to integrate their monotheistic thought and be a little more pluralistic,” Paul said. “It’s respect, it’s understanding of other traditions, other people and other sexual orientations, and above it all, it’s respect, understanding and dignity, and you can only do that by listening.”
Cyrus Khandalavala, a sophomore studying international relations, agreed on the importance of students attending events like these.
“A lot of people just follow the preconceived ideas they have about religion, so when you actually get into conversations with them, you can complicate your viewpoint in important ways,” Khandalavala said.

Each year, students in California public schools sit to take the California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress exam, which determines how prepared students are for college. Those test scores were just recently released, and while students in the Los Angeles Unified School District scored better on this year’s state standardized test than last year’s, only 39 percent of students met the benchmark standards in English and only 29 percent meet standards in math. Despite how low these numbers remain, the district did improve by 4 percent and 6 percent in math and English respectively. This year’s scores remain notably low for certain groups, such as black students and those learning English as a second language.
Wealthier schools, such as Wonderland Avenue Elementary School in the Hollywood Hills (where 84 percent of students met the English standards and 83 percent met the math standards) tend to outperform more economically disadvantaged schools on exams of this nature. Standardized tests that measure aptitude and college readiness reflect the trend in K-12 education that illustrates the large impact wealth has on a student’s education. Thus, these tests often predict a student’s wealth more than his or her intelligence and should not be given as much weight by government and education officials when determining a student’s aptitude for success.
Though opinions differ as to why, on K-12 achievement tests and college entrance exams, lower-income students, as well as black and Latino students, consistently score below privileged white and Asian students. In fact, the socioeconomic status of a child’s parents has always been one of the strongest predictors of the child’s academic achievement and educational attainment. Some explanations as to why this gap exists relate to neighborhood conditions, school quality, parental investments, the educational attainment of the parents and family structure. These gaps still persist, as apparent in this year’s LAUSD CASPP scores, despite decades of research and numerous studies attempting to explain and close them. However, one recent related study shows a closing of one major socioeconomic gap dealing with kindergarten readiness. Stanford University’s Sean Reardon, a professor of poverty and inequality in education, studies the gap between wealthy and impoverished children in terms of how prepared they are to begin kindergarten, and how that gap has changed since the late 1990s. From 1998 to 2010, his research illustrates how the gap between wealthy and poor students’ preparation for kindergarten has improved by about one month’s more time of instruction. This is an achievement, especially considering the skills that children possess when they enter kindergarten can be very predictive of how the child will progress through school.
Scores on college entrance exams such as the SAT also illustrate a strong correlation between wealth and high scores. What is ironic, however, is that the SAT was devised as a tool to identify talented students from underprivileged backgrounds, and was originally thought of as a test of aptitude rather than learned knowledge. According to John Katzman, president and founder of The Princeton Review, predictive tests like the SAT measure “only about 18 percent of the things that it takes to do well in school,” and have only a 4 percent chance of predicting success in college. SAT scores are strongly correlated with income, parental educational attainment and ethnicity. Thus, wealthy white or Asian students, whose parents have a graduate degree, and who have taken the PSAT before the SAT, are more likely to get high scores on the exam than a minority student whose parents have a only a high school degree. The difference in exam scores between two such students could be as high as 400 or 500 points.
Overall, less importance should be given to exams that seek to measure student intelligence. These sorts of high stakes standardized tests, like the CASPP and other exams in United States public schools or college entrance exams like the SAT, are not accurate measurements of what students have learned. They cannot assess critical thinking skills and instead teach students how to memorize information more than learn actual material. Moreover, these types of exams more often illustrate a link between high test scores and family wealth more than innate or learned intelligence.

The data actually shows that poorer Asian-Americans score better on tests than affluent kids from other ethnic groups.  
And as an Asian-American myself, I would like the author to whitesplain to me how I have privilege. I didn’t grow up in Rancho Palos Verdes. 
I am confused by this editorial – is the author saying students from wealthier families tend to perform better on standardized tests or is it only wealthier White and Asian students that do better on standardized tests? Is this a racial AND economic dynamic or just racial or just economic? Do wealthy Blacks and Latinos do better on standardized tests than poor Asians and Whites?
This article is such a poor desperate attempt to point a finger at some racist bogeyman of society it trips all over itself.

When it comes to knowledge of civics and history, Americans are an embarrassingly ignorant people. David McCullough, a Pulitzer Prize-winning historian, said in an interview with the Wall Street Journal, “We’re raising young people who are, by and large, historically illiterate.” Statistics widely support this claim. In 2011, Newsweek magazine asked 1,000 Americans questions from the U.S. citizenship test. The study showed that 73 percent couldn’t say why we engaged in the Cold War and 29 percent failed to identify the vice president. The University of Pennsylvania’s Annenberg Public Policy Center found that a mere 36 percent of Americans knew all three branches of the U.S. government; 35 percent couldn’t name even one. This staggering unawareness of government and history among Americans seems particularly relevant in a time where one of the major candidates for the presidency evokes memories of the most deplorable individuals and events in our nation’s past. As his struggling campaign heads into the final months of the election season, Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump and his surrogates have attempted to soften some of his stances. But, make no mistake, his words, actions and policies have consistently reflected the absolute worst in our history and no superficial pivot will change that. His recent meeting with the Mexican President Enrique Peña Nieto only served to underline his historical ties to America’s most embarrassing eras. 
Trump’s rhetoric of fear and division bares a striking resemble to that of Sen. Joseph McCarthy, a man who engaged in an infamous witch hunt of alleged communists. Trump and McCarthy similarly employed fear-mongering and fiery language making many Americans unjustifiably suspicious of their fellow citizens. Both men accused groups of dishonorable behavior, from sympathizing with communism to publicly celebrating the 9/11 attacks, with sweeping statements and insufficient, even nonexistent evidence. Billionaire Warren Buffett noted that some of Trump’s comments regarding the Gold Star Kahn family reminded him of McCarthy’s tactics. Buffet directed toward Trump the famous question originally for McCarthy: “Have you no sense of decency, sir?” 
Trump’s proposal to ban all Muslims, which his campaign has clumsily attempted to moderate, seems awfully similar to the Chinese Exclusion Act, a law that has been deemed one of the most blatant forms of discrimination in our history. Yanan Wang wrote in the Washington Post, “The Chinese Exclusion Act is … the closest cousin to what Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump proposed.” Rarely has this type of lawful restriction on a certain group of people actually existed in the United States and, yet, Trump has called for a return to a similar policy. 
Last week, in the immediate aftermath of his meeting with Nieto, Trump reinforced his hard-edged, anti-immigration message. Trump’s continual depiction of undocumented Mexican immigrants as dangerous and threatening is yet another example of the recurring xenophobia and nativism that has consistently plagued the United States since its inception. From the Irish and Italians to the Polish and Germans, nearly every major immigrant population has faced exclusion, intolerance and countless “need not apply” signs.  Trump’s language about Mexicans is an extension of this disgraceful pattern. The connection seems obvious between the glaring ignorance of Americans and the rise of Donald Trump, a man who embodies the absolute worst of our country’s past. 
If only Trump supporters could see his similarities to those shameful periods and realize that supporting him is to align yourself on the wrong side of history. Like McCarthy, like exclusionary policies, like extreme nativism and xenophobia, Trump and his supporters will, in time, be deemed morally reprehensible. It is a pity that a sizable amount of citizens in this country will ultimately be forced to explain themselves to their grandchildren. 
I suppose you believe Hillary’s stance on murdering unborn children is less shameful than Trump’s position on immigration issues.  How will you explain yourself to your grandchildren, assuming you allow them to be born…
The author shows an ignorance of basic economics.  Supply and demand for labor does matter.  The US does not have an infinite ability to absorb laborers, nor does its culture have an infinite ability to absorb citizens who don’t want to assimilate.  It’s not shameful for America’s government to put the interests of US citizens first before those of other countries.  Wilkes simple-minded comparison to historical figures fits the leftist guilt by association pattern that Alynskyites have attempted to promulgate.  There’s a lot more nuance in real history -e.g. the Communists really did murder millions of their own citizens and wanted to do the same to us.  We’re not buying the ahistorical left-wing nonsense.  Maybe she would benefit by reading Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn?
you actually show an ignorance of basic economics.
have you looked at the economic stagnation in japan or the EU over the last 25 and 5 years, respectively?
many economists agree that this is due to an aging workforce combined with other demographic trends limiting growth.
however, the US’s post-recession recovery has been one of the strongest in the developed world, and a main reason for that is our expanding young workforce which is in large part due to immigration.
but then you devolve into an incoherent tirade against “leftist guilt” so i doubt many people are taking your opinion seriously anyways
Actually I have an MBA and a BA in History (minor in Economics), so no I don’t take your criticism seriously.  As for a strong recovery, what are you smoking?  Labor force participation rate is terrible.  You would benefit from reading Amity Shlaes’ book on the Great Depression and how federal intervention prolonged it.  You don’t have the facts behind you.
you should actually read milton freidman’s analysis of the great depression.  even though he’s a noted skeptic of government intervention, his analysis (which is commonly accepted in the academic community) is that the fed didn’t do enough in face of the great depression.
and i’m majoring in econ :)

Junior center Toa Lobendahn tore both his ACL and MCL and is out for the season, head coach Clay Helton announced after practice on Thursday. 
Lobendahn sustained the tear in the season opener against Alabama. 
“It’s very sad news for us,” Helton said. “[Lobendahn’s] one of the loves of my life; he will be missed greatly.”
Doctors discovered the MCL tear earlier in the week, then proceeded to find the ACL tear following more observations, according to Helton. 
Lobendahn appeared to suffer the injury in the first quarter of last week’s season-opener against No. 1 Alabama. On a fourth-and-7 play, Alabama linebacker Ryan Anderson fell on Lobendahn’s knee following a sack, likely aggravating the injury. Loebendahn remained in the contest until the beginning of the fourth quarter. 
“Being the warrior that he is, he didn’t even complain about it,” Helton said. “He came off the field after the game and said [to the coaches], ‘My knee just doesn’t feel right.’”
Lobendahn has a history with knee injuries; this is the second consecutive season that a torn ACL has derailed Lobendahn’s season. He missed the final seven games of the season after injuring his knee in the Utah game. 
 Redshirt junior Nico Falah will replace Lobendahn. With several injuries at the center position last season, Falah stepped into the role in 2015 to close out the season. 
“Falah has been in this position before and did a great job for us last year towards the latter half of the season,” Helton said. “I have all the confidence in the world in [Falah] … he’s a veteran — a redshirt junior — who has been out here every single day at practice working his tail off just for this opportunity.”
Helton said Lobendahn has already undergone surgery and that the junior will use a redshirt year. 
Falah is an offensive tackle who can also play center. His lone career start came in the Pac-12 championship game last season against Stanford. 
Helton said that redshirt freshman Cole Smith will serve as Falah’s backup and redshirt sophomore Chris Brown could play center in an emergency.
