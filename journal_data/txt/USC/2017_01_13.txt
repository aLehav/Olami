It’s a new year, a new semester, but the same me. Your girl is back and better than ever. 
I’ve never been a New Year’s resolutions kind of chick, probably because all my promises to eat healthier quickly expire as soon as I have a craving for a burger after the ball drops. 
Some things never change, but since we last spoke some did. 
I’m 22 now, have three tattoos and finally swiped my New Year’s Eve kiss card to name a few. 
After celebrating the birth of baby Jesus, it was onto the annual Benihanas turn up three days later for my own birthday. My cake featured six mini liquor bottles, a naked barbie and the words “22 savage” so if you can guess where the night went… Well your guess is probably better than mine since I don’t quite remember all the details. 
After recovering from what was surprisingly not as bad as a hangover as I expected, it was back to Los Angeles to get ready for classes to start — my last semester as USC. 
Wow. 
It’s so surreal saying that (wipes tears). For any other last-semester seniors, I’m sure you can relate to what has been a whirlwind four years. Filled with first-time experiences, self discoveries and (I’m sure) still a lot of trying to get it together. From falling in love and heartbreaks, internships and searching for what will be your career to making new friends and checking off all your boxes on the quintessential college experience list — we can’t forget beer pong tournaments, Trojan football games and cramming for tests. 
You’re probably reading this at the conclusion of what will be your last first week of school. I know reality set in pretty fast, when I checked my inbox at about over 100 blackboard notifications. 
To those of you who braved the rain and actually made it to all your classes for syllabus week, 10 points to you. After searching for my science building for way too long in the rain and walking into class on Monday to math written all over the chalkboard — yes, a chalkboard, I won’t lie that I for a solid couple of minutes had an internal debate with myself about whether or not this was something I actually wanted to commit to. But, I ended up sticking it out and realized that the class was really just like an episode of House. The professor, whose credentials went on for days, described a patient and his or her symptoms, and then called on students to diagnose the problem. I was already feeling like a full fledged doctor. Where my stethoscope at?
Followed by a class about happiness and well-being and then another all about drugs, I was off to a pretty solid start. I told myself I would never take an 8 a.m. again after suffering through the wake-up call for my Spanish class two semesters in a row, but when I saw that the infamous “Drugs, Behavior, and Society” class was open I had to jump on it regardless of the time slot. I guess discussing marijuana at the crack of dawn is doable. 
I ended my week in my yoga class, or more accurately put, my scheduled nap time for the week, Thursday afternoon. I fully expected to look like an embarrassing excuse for a pretzel during the class, but we ended up focusing on our breathing and laying down the whole time. Guys, I could get used to this meditation thing. I think my chakras are opening up already. 
Onto the long week… Bish, don’t kill my vibe.

Researchers at USC, along with psychologists from Temple University, have concluded their three-year study on the likelihood of individuals to trust others. Conducted at USC’s Institute for Creative Technologies, the study found that individuals are unreliable evaluators of other’s trustworthiness. 
Photo courtesy of Gale Lucas Trust me · USC researcher Gale Lucas and her team found that people often perceive others as being trustworthy when their behaviors indicate otherwise.
“Trustworthiness can be objective or subjective,” said Gale Lucas, the researcher who lead the study. “Objective is whether a person acts in a trustworthy manner in a situation, whereas subjective is whether that person is perceived as trustworthy.”
People are accustomed to making assumptions when first meeting an individual, according to the study. Assumptions range from knowledge  level to morality, a phenomenon called thin slicing. One of the routes of thin slicing is that of trustworthiness.
“We often make judgements about whether we can trust someone during a social interaction,” Lucas said. “These range from everyday interactions with acquaintances to ‘bigger’ moments like buying a car.” 
Using computer modeling, the researchers tracked the facial and body movements of approximately 300 participants who were placed into pairs to role-play negotiations as antique shop owners. Participants were given the value of each item and tasked with reaching an agreement about six antique items.   
At the end of the allotted time, each individual rated their partner on how honest they thought their partner was. By figuring out how many lies each individual had told during the task, experimenters were able to establish a baseline for which individuals were honest and which individuals were not.
Participants believed that overall positivity, controlled smiles and head pose variability — the amount of which each person moved his or her head — represented trustworthiness. However, these expressions were found to be linked to untrustworthiness. Smiling joyously, researchers noted, indicated that a person was more likely to be untrustworthy — even though participants did not pick up on this during the study. Contempt was seen as indicative of untrustworthiness, but in reality was linked to trustworthiness. The only criteria that individuals correctly believed indicated trustworthiness was the amount of time someone spoke.
“In our context, a negotiation between two people, we found that these non-verbal signals that people use are not the ones that actually predict whether someone is lying or not,” Lucas said. “The only signal that people cued in on correctly was how much the other person talked. People who talk a lot are perceived as less trustworthy, and indeed, they are more likely to lie.” 
The study concluded that people often depend too much on facial expressions when determining someone’s trustworthiness due to poorly evaluating behaviors and actions. 
According to Lucas, the study has real-world implications.
“There is some potential use for this research to build computational systems that can use this information,” Lucas said. “The computational models described in the paper could be used to inform development of an agent that could assist users in making better judgements. A user could be ‘reminded’ by a computer agent to question their judgements of others’ trustworthiness when they are basing them on these ‘intuitive’ signals like positive facial expression.”

ONE National Gay & Lesbian Archives at the USC Libraries — the world’s largest repository of LGBTQ materials — will digitize 4,200 LGBTQ political posters and protest signs from its collection. The materials will be made accessible through the USC Digital Library and the Digital Public Library of America for free public access. 
Photo courtesy of ONE Born this way · The ONE Archives strive to paint a picture of the LGBTQ community’s history of social and political activism.
According to the Council on Library and Information Resources, the collection, named “Out Front: 60 Years of LGBTQ Political Graphics,” houses mostly signs and posters from Pride celebrations and protests.
“Some highlights are iconic posters created by ACT UP, the Gay Liberation Front and 1950s-era homophile organizations like the Mattachine Society,” CLIR reported. “These posters, stored in flat files at the ONE Archives’ facility, are exceedingly difficult to access. They comprise some of the few remaining visual traces of pioneering activists and organizations that advanced the struggle for LGBTQ equality.”
The ONE Archives focus on collecting, preserving and making available documents to help paint a picture of the LGBTQ history and culture. 
ONE founder Jim Kepner cultivated his own personal collection of LGBTQ archives and then merged with ONE Institute in 1994 to create the ONE National Gay & Lesbian Archives. The collection of archives has grown to become the largest storehouse of LGBTQ content in the world and the oldest ongoing LGBTQ organization in the country.
Loni Shibuyama, a ONE Archives librarian, explained that the main goal for the organization is to make the collections available to as many people as possible.
“Generally speaking, most of what we have is one of a kind, so if anybody wants to look at the materials, they would have to physically visit our archives in order to look at them,” Shibuyama said. “By digitizing our materials, we have the ability to make them available online. This makes it easy for people from all over the world to be able to look at the archives and use them for different purposes.”
According to Shibuyama, the archives will be accessible to anyone affiliated with USC.
“Whether you’re a student, a documentary filmmaker, scholar or professor you are able to look at the primary materials that we have,” Shibuyama said. “You can interpret them and share them, add to the dialogue on the LGBT community and their contributions [to] society.” 
Catherine Quinlan, dean of USC Libraries, conveyed a similar focus for the project.
“We try to collect materials that build our LGBT or ONE library,” Quinlan said. “The focus, however, is not just on the archives, but  on having archives that really speak to the specific research and teaching that’s done at this campus. We try very hard to provide materials that really support and enhance what our students and our faculty do here.”
Quinlan hopes that by sharing these visual materials, USC will not only be able to document LGBTQ viewpoints since the 1950s, but also spearhead a continued collection of data and analysis of the lives of the LGBTQ community.
“The more people hear about what we have, the more interested they are in making sure that we fill in gaps in our collection,” Quinlan said. “A lot of archival materials are held in the hands of individuals — not just institutions — and we’re trying to make sure those individual collections are preserved and can be accessible.”
Quinlan also said that people oftentimes feel encouraged to share their materials with the library once they realize the historical importance of the documents they own.
“When people find out that we have these political graphics at the ONE Archives they think, ‘ I have some stuff. I didn’t know it’d be of interest to anybody, would you like to add it to your collection?’ It really helps develop and enhance our collection even further,” Quinlan said.

The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences announced that it will honor Professor Parag Havaldar with an Academy Award in the category of Scientific and Technical Achievement for his work at Sony Pictures Imageworks. Havaldar graduated with a Ph.D. in computer visions and graphics from USC Viterbi School of Engineering — where he currently teaches — in 1996. 
Photo courtesy of Parag Havaldar And the Oscar goes to · Professor Parag Havaldar received his Ph.D. from the USC Viterbi School of Engineering in 1996. He went on to improve methods of creating facial expressions for animated characters.
Currently a Research and Development lead at Blizzard Entertainment, Havaldar attributes the foundation of his knowledge to his time at USC. 
He said interest in computer technology, computer vision and psychology is rooted in his love of storytelling.
“I have always believed in the power of stories and movies,” Havaldar said. “I was fortunate to follow my passion in computer graphics and develop technologies in animation that give life to these stories, and ultimately end up touching the hearts and minds of audiences around the world.”
The Academy acknowledged Havaldar’s work, recognizing its importance in the field of animation.
“This pioneering system enabled large-scale use of animation rig-based facial performance-capture for motion pictures, combining solutions for tracking, stabilization, solving and animator-controllable curve editing,” Ray Feeney, chair of the Scientific and Technical Awards Committee, said in a statement to the Academy.
Havaldar designed a technique to create realistic facial expressions for animated characters in films. His design allows performers in production to act out their parts while their facial expressions are analyzed, digitally copied and constructed in animated characters.
Havaldar has worked with renowned actors such as Angelina Jolie, and is an integral part of the process that these actors undergo during their digital mimicking. 
 Describing his development as one that saves time, cost and energy for the company, Havaldar said he and his counterparts play a key role in creating an efficient, successful film production. 
“It doesn’t happen by one person ever,” Havaldar said. “It is everyone working together for the same purpose. In my case a lot of people helped. I had good technologists, actors and mentors supporting me along the way.”
Havaldar is a part-time lecturer in the department of computer science at Viterbi. His class, Multimedia Systems and Design, is offered to graduate students.
Havaldar expressed appreciation for his students, as he believes they have never failed to spark his curiosity over the past decade.
“When I look back at my days at USC, I did have a lot of fun,” Havaldar said. “But if you can, find a goal that you want to achieve from a young age and follow that direction, and make time for it. If you can figure out your passion and what you want to achieve and make sure you utilize that passion, and make progress every day, every week, every month, little by little you’ll find that you will achieve a lot.”

After a big upset over No. 3 Long Beach State on Wednesday, the men’s volleyball team is on a high note. The Trojans don’t get a break, however, as they take on 5-1 Cal State Northridge at the Galen Center on Saturday. 
Katie Chin | Daily Trojan Set up for success · Sophomore Matt Douglas sets the ball for a teammate. The Trojans are 2-2 after upsetting No. 3 Long Beach State.
“Northridge is a very, very physical team,” head coach Jeff Nygaard said. “They bomb the ball from the service line, they take big swings from the outside and they run a challenging offensive scheme.”
Nygaard wants to see his team  set the tone early in order to pull out to a quick lead. However, he doesn’t want the team merely focusing on trying to outmuscle their opponents and forgetting their tactics.
“If we get caught up in a war of attrition of just trying to out-physical each other, that plays into their strengths,” Nygaard said. “If we’re able to break them down and we’re able to stay in the system, not just offensively but also defensively, I think we’ll give ourselves a great opportunity to have success.”
The Trojans were able to upset Long Beach State on Wednesday with contributions from multiple players. Senior outside hitter Lucas Yoder had six digs, senior middle blocker Andy Benesh had 12 kills and sophomore middle blocker Connor Inlow added a career high nine kills. Freshman outside hitter Aaron Strange also contributed with five kills and and nine digs.
“Lucas [Yoder] is playing great,” Nygaard said. “Gert [Lisha] is setting a good system. Andy’s [Benesh] taking care of the defense and taking care of his offense.”
The balanced attack kept Long Beach State on its heels, unable to win by shutting down just one part of the Trojans’ game. It also highlighted the depth of Nygaard’s team, highlighting a range of players from seasoned upperclassmen to rookies. Nygaard was especially impressed with Inlow’s career match. 
“He came up big for us, which is what I think he should be doing consistently,” Nygaard said. “When it mattered the most, he was all in.”
A key factor for the Trojans is the consistency of Yoder, who has come into his final year as a Trojan with style. Yoder is already leading the team in kills, preceding his performance against Long Beach State with a career best 33-kill night against Penn State.
However, a single player has yet to be able to cement a game for the Trojans on his own. The Trojans fell to Penn State despite Yoder’s career night, and their performances are at their peak when statistics are spread across the roster.
If the Trojans want to remain in the win column against the Matadors, they will have to continue this balanced attack and protect their home court against a physical team. An upset win over a highly ranked opponent is one thing, but providing consistency at home and on the road will be the next challenge for USC to tackle.
The match will take place at 7 p.m. at home in the Galen Center on Saturday.

After opening the season with a 14-0 record through non-conference play, USC found itself ranked as high as No. 22 back on Dec. 30. But now, after falling to Utah on the road Thursday night, the Trojans find themselves on their first losing streak of the season and the losers of three of their last four games. 
Katie Chin | Daily Trojan Going big · Sophomore forward Chimezie Metu drives into the paint. Metu led the team with 17 points, but couldn’t keep the Trojans afloat.
On a night when No. 25 USC opened the game on a 10-0 run, the Trojans suffered costly scoring droughts and were overwhelmed by strong, lengthy scoring runs from Utah. The Trojans (15-3, 1-3) fell to Utah on the road Thursday night, 86-64. 
USC is now 1-3 to open conference play this season. Through the first four conference games of this season, the Trojans have suffered two losses by a margin of over 20 points, including a 23-point loss to Oregon on Dec. 30 and a 22-point loss to Utah on Thursday. 
After USC opened the game by scoring 10 unanswered points, Utah (12-4, 3-1) answered with a 16-4 run that gave the Utes a lead midway through the first half that they would not relinquish for the remainder of the game. 
Utah missed its first five field goal attempts of the game, but then proceeded to make 18-of-23 shots (78.3 field goal percentage) to conclude the first half. The Utes’ strong finish to the first half put USC behind 44-31 at the break. 
An 11-0 Utah run spanning just over three minutes in the second half put the Utes ahead of the Trojans 66-45 with 10 minutes remaining in regulation. 
In a losing effort, USC sophomore forward Chimezie Metu scored 17 points on 6-of-10 shooting from the field. He also reeled in five rebounds and recorded two blocked shots. Metu, a 74 percent shooter from the free throw line this season, went just 5-of-10 (50 percent) from the foul line Thursday night. 
After USC shot 10-of-21 (47.6 percent) from the free throw line in Sunday’s one-point loss to Cal at home, the Trojans’ struggles at the line continued against Utah. USC shot 14-of-26  (53.8 percent) from the foul line against the Utes on Thursday night. 
Utah freshman guard Devon Daniels was the leading performer for the Utes, scoring 17 points. Daniels was 3-for-3 from 3-point range Thursday. 
As a team, Utah shot 9-of-17 (52.9 percent) from the 3-point line over USC. Meanwhile, the Trojans shot 6-of-16 (37.5 percent) from long distance. 
USC junior guard Elijah Stewart struggled with foul trouble against Utah, as he was forced to sit out in the second half after picking up his fourth personal foul. Stewart, USC’s second-leading scorer (averaging 13.9 points per game), finished the game 0-of-6 from the field, recording no points scored in the Trojans’ loss. 
USC will continue its road trip this weekend when it travels to the Coors Event Center to take on Colorado (10-6, 0-3) Sunday night in another Pac-12 matchup. 
Consecutive conference losses — especially by large margins — will likely push the Trojans out of the top 25 rankings for the first time since Dec. 15 of this season. 
Pathetic performance. Outscored by 32 pts. after leading 10 – 0 at the start. Another mediocre coaching job on the road by Enfield and staff. Looking at another two losses if can’t turn it around at Colorado somehow w/ ucla after that. Not playing
the Trade Tech’s of the country anymore on your schedule.

After being selected in the 2017 National Women’s Soccer League draft on Thursday, five USC women’s soccer players will join the professional ranks of soccer.
Seniors Morgan Andrews, Kayla Mills, Mandy Freeman, Katie Johnson and Sammy Jo Prudhomme were all in attendance at the draft ceremony, and it did not take long for the reigning national champions to hear their names called. 
Steven Kramer | Daily Trojan
Andrews was selected in the first round with the No. 3 overall pick by the Boston Breakers, while Mills (No. 4 overall) and Freeman (No. 10 overall) will become teammates once again for Sky Blue FC. Johnson was taken with the No. 16 overall pick by Seattle Reign FC, and Prudhomme was selected No. 31 overall by the Boston Breakers.
After transferring from Notre Dame as a junior, Andrews became one of the most decorated players to ever play at USC. She finished her USC career as a 2016 finalist for the MAC Hermann Trophy, awarded to the nation’s best collegiate soccer player.
In her senior season, Andrews tied for the team scoring lead with 10 goals and added four assists en route to helping USC capture the program’s second-ever national championship. Andrews will likely make an immediate impact in the midfield for the Breakers, who finished 10th in the NWSL standings last season. After being selected No. 3 overall, Andrews is the highest-ever USC player taken in the NWSL draft.
Andrews will be joined by Prudhomme, who took first pick in the fourth round (No. 31 overall). The talented transfer keeper finished a standout senior season as the 2016 Pac-12 Goalkeeper of the Year.
In her final game at the NCAA College Cup, Prudhomme tallied eight big saves to help USC win the title and earned All-Tournament Team honors. Her .906 save percentage ranked fifth nationally, and she led the Pac-12 by only allowing nine goals in 19 games this season. Prudhomme was just one of three goalkeepers taken in the draft.
Mills and Freeman will also head to the East Coast, making their home in New Jersey with Sky Blue FC. A steady four-year starter for the Trojans, Mills was named to the All Pac-12 First Team three years in a row. She was also named to the watch list for the MAC Hermann Trophy Award in 2016 and won the 2015 Pac-12 Defensive Player of the Year award. 
As a converted forward turned defensive midfielder, she will likely play left back for her new team. Her speed and strength along the flanks will allow her to fill a big need for Sky Blue.
Freeman was selected by Sky Blue FC with the No. 10 overall pick in the first round. This season, she led the defense to 16 shutouts and won the 2016 Pac-12 Defensive Player of the Year award.  Like Mills, Freeman was a four-year starter and played positions ranging from defensive midfield to center back. A highly coveted player, Freeman will shore up Sky Blue FC’s defense as the pair joins former USC goalkeeper Caroline Stanley in New Jersey.
The final Trojan will head to Seattle Reign, a powerhouse program bolstered by players such as U.S. star midfielder Megan Rapinoe. Johnson was the fourth Trojan to be selected in the draft at No. 16 overall to Seattle Reign FC. Johnson was the 2016 NCAA College Cup Hero, as her three goals in two games helped propel USC to an upset over top-ranked West Virginia in the national final.
Her goal-scoring prowess and international experience competing in 2016 Rio Olympics Qualifications with the Mexican National Team was invaluable to the Trojan’s success. This depth of experience will allow her to make significant contributions for a Seattle Reign team that finished fifth in the regular season last year.
NWSL play will kick off in April, with the newly drafted seniors joining their new teams after graduation. From there, these former Trojans will begin to live out their life-long dreams of becoming professional athletes.

Too much of a good thing is a bad thing. 
Last August, I ended a column about the St. Louis Rams moving to Los Angeles with this precaution: 
“Ninety-one thousand people may pack the Coliseum for a preseason NFL game just to check out the shiny new toy, but how many will actually show up in Week 16 to watch a team with a 3-11 record?”
I wound up one game off in my prediction — the Rams finished their woeful inaugural season back in Los Angeles with a 4-12 record, general dysfunction up and down the franchise and without a head coach. 
As for the interest? Let the pictures of the half-empty Coliseum circulating around social media and the poor television ratings speak for themselves. 
If owner Stan Kroenke and the Rams thought that they could short-circuit their way to the spotlight simply by moving to the City of Angels, they found out pretty soon that they were only knockin’ on heaven’s door.
Thursday morning’s announcement that the San Diego Chargers will seek relocation to Los Angeles by owner Dean Spanos is yet another sign of a team that takes the bait of thinking it can make everything work in the second largest media market in the country.
Sure, “Los Angeles Chargers” sounds better than “San Diego Chargers” — on paper (and even that is doubtful, because their new logo is objectively awful and rightfully being roasted on social media). But now, Los Angeles and Orange County will have a combined 10 professional sports teams by 2018 (including the MLS’ Los Angeles Galaxy and LAFC, an expansion team launching next year in a new stadium near the USC campus). And that’s not counting USC and UCLA, whose college football teams both have a considerable and loyal fanbase. 
Save for the lowly Padres, the Chargers are the team in San Diego. They’ve been there since 1961. They have supporters that remain interested because, well, what are your other sports options in January when baseball season doesn’t start for another three months? 
In Los Angeles, the Chargers will have the Rams, Lakers, Clippers, Kings, Ducks, USC and UCLA to compete with for attention during their season. With a mediocre roster, a 35-year-old starting quarterback, no head coach, no recent success and no real reason to watch them, the Chargers will probably draw less interest than the two college teams. 
It may explain why they are reportedly choosing the 27,000-seat StubHub Center — a soccer stadium that is vastly undersized for football games — as their temporary home while they wait for 2019, when their joint stadium with the Rams in Inglewood will be ready. At least now, a crowd that wouldn’t even fill a third of the Coliseum would be considered a sellout. 
There certainly are experts fully on board the NFL-to-L.A. train. They say that the area already houses two teams in each professional sports league, and that tacking on two teams in one more league can be done. They argue that any team that goes 4-12 — like the Rams did in their first season back — will see a lukewarm reaction from fans, regardless of location. 
And they may be right. But it’s more of the principle of the matter. These cases — both the Rams and Chargers moving to Los Angeles. — were not situations that had to happen. Sure, both St. Louis and San Diego couldn’t figure out their respective stadium situations. But both Kroenke and Spanos are billionaires. If they wanted to build new stadiums, they could have just done it rather than cry for taxpayer money. 
Instead, what we have is both owners throwing their hands up, bolting to the “quick-fix” of Los Angeles and swindling loyal fanbases in the process. But you see, Los Angeles doesn’t need the Rams the way that St. Louis does. Same goes for the Chargers and San Diego.
Well, perhaps Angelenos dying for an NFL team are happy now, with a Rams squad in disarray just one year in and now forced to root for a Chargers franchise that very few L.A. sports fans connect with whatsoever. Too much of a good thing is a bad thing, and it’s a problem that Los Angeles has: too many teams, too much competition and too little time for people to care about franchises that move into their city for no other reason than money. 
For now, we’ll begrudgingly welcome the Chargers to Los Angeles, a city that somehow has two NFL teams, but neither needs nor deserves even one of them.
