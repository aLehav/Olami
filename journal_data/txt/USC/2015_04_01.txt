April 6 will mark the kickoff of USC’s first Staff Appreciation week, a five-day event put on by students and dedicated to honoring the work of the USC Hospitality staff.
The week will consist of a series of activities and presentations, which aim to raise awareness about USC Hospitality and the individuals who work in the division.
The idea was spearheaded and organized by the “journeymen” of Delta Omicron Zeta, USC’s leadership fraternity. Journeymen are the equivalent of pledge class members in traditional fraternities, and in DOZ, one of the first tasks assigned to new members is to identify a problem on campus and come up with a plan to combat the issue.
Austin Roy, a sophomore majoring in cognitive science and a DOZ journeyman, said the new members had many diverse and sound ideas.
“Someone wanted to build a garden on top of Leavey, but a lot of us agreed on the idea of Staff Appreciation Week, in light of the recent strike events,” Roy said.
The idea for a the event was led by two DOZ journeymen — Domenica Ordonez, a freshman majoring in architecture, and Hannah Kulis, a freshman majoring in piano.
Throughout this semester, hospitality workers on campus have protested for higher wages, and recently came to an agreement with USC for a 75-cent raise. Regardless, Roy maintains that the incentives for Staff Appreciation Week have little to do with wages.
“We really wanted to focus on staff appreciation,” Roy said. “We think that staff members can feel unappreciated by students. I think they should feel just as much a part of the Trojan family, as students, their family members and the staff members do.”
For each day of Staff Appreciation Week, there will be a different event that is geared toward making staff members feel more at home on campus. The week begins with “Manners Monday” on April 6, in which students are encouraged to take a “selfie” with a staff member and upload it on to any social media platform with the tag #ThankYouUSCStaff.
On “Tea Tuesday,” participants will meet at the Finger Fountain at 11:55 p.m. to deliver tea to security workers who work late-night shifts.
From 10 a.m. to 3 p.m. on Wednesday, there will be a table on Trousdale with information about employees’ wages and the issues they face. During the same time on Thursday, the table will serve as a station for students to write thank you notes to an individual worker or a division of staff workers as a whole. These notes will be posted on a mural that will be presented on campus.
On April 10, or “Festive Friday,” the event will conclude with a concert located at the VKC arches at 5 p.m. The concert will feature a number of student music and entertainment groups.
All events are posted on USC Staff Appreciation Week’s Facebook event page, which nearly 500 people have already joined.

USC professor Travis Longcore’s has developed indoor lighting that attracts fewer insects.
This development alters the currently popular LED and fluorescent lights, which use all wavelengths of the color spectrum evenly.
Consumer electronics company Philips Research asked Longcore to work with them to test indoor lighting options that would minimize insect attraction. At the time, Longcore was an adjunct professor at both UCLA and USC, and he brought Philips Institute’s research quandary to the senior research practicum he led during the winter and spring quarters for UCLA’s environmental science major.
“[The UCLA students] had developed some technology for being able to take custom [LED] bulbs and create a similar color of light in many different ways,” Longcore said. “Even though we may look at a light and say ‘it’s all white,’ you can create that color by mixing different wavelengths in certain ways.”
On the light spectrum, wavelengths smaller than 500 nanometers, which produce blue, violet and UV, generally attract arthropods. Lighting with reduced ecological impacts is already used outdoors — on street lamps for example — so insects are less attracted to these than to a light that emits blue wavelengths. However, these outdoor lights are far too yellow for indoor use; humans prefer white lights, which generally emit the full color spectrum.
Longcore and his seven-student team work builds upon this intersection between human use and insect behavior, establishing that LED lights can be manipulated to omit blue lights, reducing insect attraction, but still appear the same as full-spectrum LED lighting to the human eye.
During the spring quarter, the students implemented their research design and placed various kinds of lights over pan traps in urban and rural environments in Los Angeles.
Over 32 separate nights, students caught insects under compact fluorescent, commercial LED and customized LED lights. Traps under the lights customized for decreased attractiveness caught significantly less arthropods than the fluorescent and commercial LED lights, which are similar in color spectrum.
The implications of developing this sort of light include not only reducing general discomfort from the presence of insects indoors at night, but they are also a first step in bringing efficient lighting that could reduce exposure to insect-borne diseases such as malaria.
Malaria infections are common enough in equatorial countries that global health studies senior Evan Pye, who has lead two Alternative Summer Break projects in Uganda affirms that “nearly everyone in Uganda has caught malaria.”
Pye explained the common malaria prevention method is to install bednets, sometimes sprayed with anti-mosquito solution. According to Pye’s notes while studying the health and income of a sampling of rural Ugandan village members, bednets are effective at preventing malaria as long as there are no holes in them; they deteriorate quickly and last about a year.
Pye also explained that underdeveloped infrastructure poses distribution problems even if additional nets are available.
Nearly 68percent of the arthropods the Longcore’s research team caught belonged to the order Diptera — which includes flies and mosquitoes. Lepidoptera —- moths and butterflies — composed 12 percent of caught insects.
Researchers sorted insects caught according to orders rather than family or species, and knowing which order won’t be attracted to a certain light is relevant when predicting which insects will carry disease.
“Orders can still tell us whether or not [insects] be disease-carriers in the tropics,” Laina Petrinec, one of the study co-authors said. “Diptera and Hemiptera carry most of the diseases, while Lepidoptera does not pose a danger.”
Petrinec says the light study points researchers in a direction to further analyze reducing insect-borne disease prevalence in moist tropical regions without compromising the ability to use electric light for indoor night use.

The Keck School of Medicine received a $10 million donation from the Stephenson family — Emmet Stephenson, Toni Stephenson and Tessa Stephenson Brand — on Wednesday to create the Stephenson Family Personalized Medicine Center at the Center for Applied Molecular Medicine. The gift specifically aids Dr. David B. Agus, professor at the Keck School of Medicine of USC, by allowing him to advance his work in discovering new practices with experimental medicine for cancer research.
According to USC News, the multi-million dollar donation has already paved the way for the appointment of executive positions within the Stephenson Family Personalized Medicine Center. Recently, Shannon Mumenthaler was appointed laboratory director and Dan Ruderman was appointed the director of analytics.
Half of the donation was contributed Brand, a USC alumna, who has dedicated much of her time to philanthropy, specifically by guiding Agus to further advancements in the future of science and technology.
“Dr. Agus is forward-thinking,” she said in a statement to USC News. “He is thinking 100 years into the future. He plans to change the face of health care rather than solve a single problem. He thinks bigger than most people, and he is the type of person we want to support.”
Agus conducts research at the Keck School of Medicine where he has developed methods to treat cancer by conducting tests in various aspects in experimental medicine. He is noted by the medical community for his personalized medicine company called Navigenics, which he co-founded alongside partner, Dietrich Stephan. His career follows a long list of field and lab work to advance new methods to cure cancer.
“Personalized medicine is really about bringing new technologies … to [provide] a whole new classification system for cancers,” Agus said in a statement to USC News.
Agus currently serves as the director of the USC Center for Applied Molecular Medicine and the USC Westside Norris Cancer Center and is the co-director of the USC National Cancer Institute.
Prior to his work at USC, Agus was the director of the Spielberg Family Center for Applied Proteomics at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles where he worked to create proteomic technologies to guide doctors to decide on important health care policies.
Agus was also a physician in oncology at Cedars-Sinai of Los Angeles, director of the Louis Warschaw Prostate Cancer center and an associate professor of medicine at the University of California, Los Angeles. He also holds the American Cancer Society Physician Research award.
Emmet, founder of StarTek Inc. and pioneer in the establishment of Domain.com, along with wife, Toni, have both committed their careers to discovering cancer research centers where they could sponsor researchers to establish strategies for the advancement of personalized medicine.
According to USC News, when Toni Stephenson was undergoing cancer treatment, Emmet Stephenson met Agus. Their meeting led to Agus’s guidance through Toni’s treatment, where he acted as the principal doctor who helped her reach an 18-month cancer remission.
“When my mom was diagnosed with late-stage lymphoma, my dad put together a team of four doctors, including Dr. Agus, to act as an advisory board for my mom’s treatments,” Tessa said in a statement to USC News. “He felt four minds were better than one, and these four people are all geniuses. We are happy to say that this team cured her.”
The grant specifically created two positions within CAMM.
Mumenthaler, holds a Ph.D from UCLA and is expected to pilot a group of researchers to study the enigmatic nature of the tumor microenvironment.
Ruderman is currently conducting his postdoctoral research at USC. His new role will allow him, along with other researchers, to conduct data to better understand the function of the genome and mutations.
“And our team is made up of physicists, mathematicians, engineers, biologists — all different disciplines who each look at data in a different fashion,” Agus said in a statement to USC News. “Our goal is to create models for what’s happening to the cancer and what will happen. And those mathematical models can hopefully tell us which treatments to do — or not to do.”

Students and panelists convened for the weekly Students Talk Back forum hosted by the Jesse M. Unruh Institute of Politics to discuss the future of public transportation in California and challenges faced by the state to fund ongoing projects.
Wednesday’s panel featured Tony Strickland, former California state senator from the 19th district; Darin Chidsey, director of strategy, policy and public affairs for the Southern California Association of Governments; Alex Kludjian, president of USC College Republicans; and Nathaniel Haas, columnist for the Daily Trojan.
The forum was moderated by Dan Schnur, executive director of the Unruh Institute, and Emma Peplow, news editor of the Daily Trojan.
Chidsey opened the discussion by providing background on few of the challenges that the state of California has faced in delivering practical, time-effective public transportation options. In his work with Southern California Association of Governments, Chidsey assists in the creation of a “Regional Transportation Plan” that the organization releases every four years, outlining solutions to reduce traffic congestion.
“There are going to be four million new people in Southern California over the next 20 years. That’s a tremendous [number] of people that are going to be operating primarily on the existing roadways,” Chidsey said. “Over the last several decades, there hasn’t been a real plan to add more lane capacities in much of Southern California.”
Chidsey named the large geographic size of the Southern Calfiornia region and its six counties as an obstacle to creating comprehensive transportation reform. One priority identified was the coordination of the location of new housing construction and transportation investment.
Next, Stickland provided historical context for Los Angeles’ transportation problems.
“Los Angeles was built around the automobile … The joke in Southern California is the mass transit that the masses don’t use,” said Strickland, who served as a legislator-in-residence for the Unruh Institute last year. “In the legislature, in my opinion, [California] missed the boat during the 1970s by a philosophy that said ‘if you don’t build, people won’t come.’ Well, people still came.”
Stickland named poor infrastructure — not only in transportation, but also in energy and water — as a challenge that the state has faced in light of the population explosion that has occurred over the past thirty years.
The panelists spoke about public-private partnerships as a way to fill gaps in funding for major infrastructure projects such as the high-speed rail project, which is expected to cost $68 billion. The price of this project has increased significantly since citizens authorized high-speed rail construction several years ago in a ballot initiative.
Kludjian argued that a high-speed rail is not a major concern of most Southern California residents.
“I have major doubts about the viability of this particular high-speed rail project,” said Kludjian, a senior majoring in political science. “I have a lot of uncertainty supporting a project that has a lot of holes in its funding sources. It’s not unprecedented for large infrastructure projects to not be completely funded, but when it is on the scale of $68 billion dollars … I feel like resources could be better diverted to issues that actually affect residents in a tangible way.”
The panel then transitioned to a discussion of the rise of rideshare programs such as Uber, Lyft and SideCar. Rideshares are seen to improve public safety by reducing the occurrence of drunk driving and provide an easy part-time employment option. Taxi companies have pushed back against ridesharing programs, however, because they do not share the same regulatory burden as taxis.
Chidsey expressed support for ridesharing programs
“[My organization] looks at ride-sharing as one of those things that’s a great complement to the system that already exists. Going back 20 or 30 years, transportation planners have always talked about carpooling and ridesharing,” Chidsey said. “Those same ideas that have been talked about for decades, there’s now a private industry solution that’s using tech to connect people in new ways.”
Though rideshares might present a viable substitute for public transportation options, Haas argued that companies like Uber and Lyft have a few drawbacks.
“Just because its cheaper, doesn’t mean that we should automatically treat Uber like Jesus arriving on Palm Sunday … There are a couple of real concerns.”
Haas explained that the company has been known to lower its prices at the disadvantage of drivers, in order to attract more riders. Even drivers who work for Uber full-time do not earn sufficient wages to cover living expenses, according to Haas.
“[Working for] Uber’s a great job, but it is one that comes without health insurance … [and] without a lot of the other benefit packages that most employees working for a major company in a good full-time job receive. These are things to remain cognizant of, but these aren’t reasons why Uber should go away or why we should oppose it,” Haas said.
The next Students Talk Back will be held April 8, and will examine the topic of the 2016 presidential race.

The Environmental Student Assembly kicked off Earth Month  on Wednesday in McCarthy Quad by celebrating its first anniversary as a USC student assembly. ESA, which programs events promoting green culture, sustainability and environmental advocacy, hosted local nonprofits and organizations, served free food and organized other activities to promote green living.
The newest addition to Program Board, ESA was first founded as a pilot project as a result of a Undergraduate Student Government resolution. ESA was created in order to bring together all environmental groups on campus and serve as their resource. With the goal of promoting sustainability while increasing environmental awareness and action on campus, ESA was officially voted into the USG constitution on April 1, 2014, the first day of Earth Month 2014.
Earth Month, held every year in April, involves a series of event programming that provides opportunities for students to celebrate and learn about the environment. This year will mark the second annual Earth Month at USC.
Some of the vendors who spread their initiatives in the greater L.A. area at ESA’s event last night included Global Green USA, Friends of the Los Angeles River, Green Grounds Los Angeles, California Greenworks, Inc. and TreePeople.
Besides raising awareness and promoting local green companies and non profits, Shawn Rhoads, executive director of ESA, said the purpose of ESA’s First Birthday Party and Awareness Fair was to celebrate the hard work, accomplishments and energy of the organization in its first year.
“There has always been a desire and need for sustainability on campus,” Rhoads said. “Many students and faculty/staff have always voiced their concerns, but the lack of community served as a roadblock for many initiatives to be implemented. For example, two organizations were working on the same campaign, at the same time, but didn’t realize it.”
ESA has become USC’s largest “green” initiative, encompassing 20 student organizations and executing impressive programs, such as the ESA Certification Program for Events, #ECOTALKS with Terry Tamminen and Ed Begley Jr., a lecture by Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger, USC Earth Month and the USC Green Engagement Fund. By the end of the spring, ESA will have held or co-sponsored 80 events since its founding.
Rhoads said that he has been working on closing the gap between students, faculty and staff regarding sustainability. One attempt included holding the Environmental Student Forum, which connected the four major environmental groups on campus: ESA, the Office of Sustainability, the Environmental Studies department and the Wrigley Institute for Environmental Studies.
“As one of the results of the forum, we created the USC Sustainability Action Network which met for the first time last Friday, comprising of [more than] 40 representatives of so many faculty and staff members from various departments, undergraduate students and graduate students,” Rhoads said. “We will be starting a movement that will shake up USC on Monday.”
ESA collaborated with Global Inheritance on the upcoming event Greenfest this Saturday, during which the L.A.-based nonprofit will teach people about the benefits and costs of different energy sources. Global Inheritance will bring Energy Playground, which includes human hamster wheels and seesaws to power cell phone charging stations.
Rhoads also said he is looking forward to seeing what ESA will accomplish in the future.
“I hope we can continue to channel our energy into even bigger programs and initiatives with more collaboration and support next year,” Rhoads said. “We still have a lot up our sleeves, and I have no doubt that ESA will move USC towards an environmentally-sustainable future.”
Correction: A previous version of this story stated that the resolution to create the Environmental Student Assembly was drafted by one member of Undergraduate Student Government. It was actually drafted by several members of USG. The Daily Trojan regrets the error.

The USC track and field team will divide and conquer this weekend as it sends athletes across the country to three different events.
The rough breakdown will have the sprinters and majority of mid-distance runners flying to Gainesville, Florida, to participate in the Florida Relays.
The other distance runners will be traveling up north to test their speed in Palo Alto at the Stanford Invitational, and the throwers will take the short trip to San Diego to compete in the California Collegiate Invitational. All three meets are considered some of the best of the season for their respective events.
The No. 7-ranked men’s team will be keeping its eyes on the Florida Relays, with great hype surrounding senior sprinter BeeJay Lee, one of three Trojans to win Pac-12 Track and Field Athlete of the Week. Lee will be competing in the 100-meter, 200-meter, 4×100 relay and the 4×200 relay. Lee currently holds the fastest time in the 200-meter in the country with a blazing 20.96, but he expects great competition over the weekend.
“A lot of pros and a lot of good colleges are going to be there,” Lee said following his workout on Monday. “Everybody is coming off the indoor season, so everyone is going to be hungry.”
The 4×200 relay team will add junior sprinter Andre De Grasse, one of the sprinters to watch heading into the outdoor season. De Grasse is a transfer from Coffeyville Community College in Coffeyville, Kansas,  and a five-time NJCAA champion.  De Grasse’s addition to the relay should allow the team to run a faster race, as well as improve its overall performance in the Sunshine State.
“It’s just going to be some friendly competition,” Lee joked. “So we can go to Florida and show them what Cali is all about.”
Meanwhile, the 800-meter runners will be competing in Palo Alto in what is recognized as one of the toughest meets of the year. Junior Reika Kijima and teammate senior Erica Capellino will represent the No. 8-ranked Women of Troy.
“I want someone to push me,” said Kijima. “This is the top competition.”
Accompanying the ladies will be freshman Robert Ford and senior Myles Andrews. Ford currently holds the sixth-best time in the NCAA for the 80-meter, and Andrews sits just behind him with the ninth-best time in the country.
The final stop for the Trojans will be for the throwers in San Diego, at one of the most elite competitions of the season.
Junior Tera Novy cites the upcoming meet as “the best ring in the country” for discus throwers. Novy competes in both the discus and the shot put. She was another of the Pac-12 Track and Field Athletes of the Week as she set a personal record in the discus with a throw long enough to crack the top-10 on USC’s all-time list. Novy currently owns the third-best discus distance in the country.
“It’s great to be high in the national rankings,” said Novy. “But it’s about who shows up that day and throws.”
This meet will serve as a great gauge for the Trojans as they see how they stack up against the nation’s best and continue working toward their goal of winning a national championship.
“We are making small improvements and working hard,” Lee said. “Our team has a pretty good chance to place high in NCAAs.”

With the men’s Final Four being held in Indianapolis this upcoming weekend, I expected most of the focus to be on Kentucky’s quest to become the first team to finish a college basketball season undefeated since, ironically, the 1976 Indiana Hoosiers.
I’m only an aspiring novelist, but I couldn’t think of a better story-book ending here than for the Wildcats to reach the 40-win pinnacle and by winning the national championship, without a single blemish on their record, in what is considered to be the cradle of basketball.
Just under 40 years ago, Hall of Fame head coach Bobby Knight led the Hoosiers to a perfect, 32-0 record on their way to cutting down the nets in 1976. Evidently, no one’s been able to match the Hoosier’s unrivaled perfection since then.
Meanwhile, the state of Indiana has been perceived as everything but perfect this past week after Indiana governor Mike Pence signed into law the Religious Freedom Restoration Act this past Saturday.
The law has prompted resentment toward the state from across the nation. Gay rights activists and opposers of the law claim that it will give Indiana businesses, landlords and employers the power to discriminate against the LGBT community.
Though the actual meaning and extension of the law seems to lack clarity and continues to be debated around the nation, it’s what the law stands for, the homophobic nature of the law, that has driven so many to call a flagrant foul on the state, even in the sports world.
In fact, our very own USC Athletic Director Pat Haden brought his stance on the Indiana law to the forefront earlier this week by announcing that he would be skipping the College Football Playoff Committee’s meeting in Indiana this week in support of his son, who happens to be gay.
“I am the proud father of a gay son.In his honor, I will not be attending the CFP committee meeting in Indy this week. #EmbraceDiversity”, Haden said on Twitter.
With his esteemed statement of endearment for not only his son, but the gay community as a whole, Haden not only continues to embody diversity for his student-athletes, but has also set the tone for other athletics directors at universities across the nation to take a similar position.
“Pat Haden is a shining light for other universities to follow,” USC track and field athlete Allen Williams, who is openly gay and a member of the LGBT USC Athletics Committee, told Annenberg TV News.
Haden, simply by speaking from his heart, has already emerged as a hero in this dilemma, but for  President Mark Emmert and the NCAA , whose headquarters are located in Indiana, the battle is just beginning.
Anyhow, at the pit of the NCAA’s core values is the notion calling for an inclusive culture that fosters equitable participation for student-athletes and career opportunities for coaches and administrators from diverse backgrounds.
The Indiana law, effective in July, could undermine the NCAA’s ability to provide that type of inclusive environment for each and every one of its student-athletes in the state, which creates a sizable problem.
It’s truly a shame that a law like this could potentially hinder an athlete’s ability to play at the highest level of collegiate athletics or even professionally.
Just this past year, monumental strides were made in the LGBT athletic community, as Michael Sam became the first openly gay player to be drafted to play in the National Football League, while University of Massachusetts basketball player Derrick Gordon emerged as the first openly gay player in Division I men’s college basketball.
The NCAA has already taken a verbal stance against the Indiana law saying that it was going to closely examine its implications, but in this case, it must be working to take all of the necessary action in order to protect its member institutions.
For a change, it shouldn’t be about the money, but rather the student-athlete, and I’m glad that the NCAA is emphasizing early on that this is a big deal.
In an interview with ESPN’s Andy Katz, Emmert said that inclusion and diversity are values that are fundamental to what college athletics are all about and what higher eduction is all about.
Pending a further clarification of the bill, Emmert added that it could lead to the NCAA reevaluating its decisions to house its offices or hold future events in the newly created environment by the Indiana law.
With the city of Indianapolis hosting a plethora of national collegiate sporting events every year including the men’s and women’s final four (next year), the Big-10 conference tournament and its football championship game, there’s a lot on the line for not only the city, but for the NCAA.
Amidst all the bad publicity that the NCAA seems to magnetize, this is an opportunity for them to finally echo the voice of the student-athlete and do the right thing: to not put any of its members or their families in the position to be discriminated against.
I I had a lacrosse coach in high school, who told us that his job was to love us. When he asked us what our job was, we would tell him that it was to love each other.
He showed me that regardless of race, gender, sexual orientation or anything else that differentiates us all, it’s the love of sport that brought us all together, which just goes to show the tremendous power that it has to influence this important issue moving forward.

A streaking USC women’s tennis team heads east to Tucson, Arizona, today to face No. 41 Arizona before taking on No. 23 Arizona State in Tempe on Saturday.
The Women of Troy remain atop both the Pac-12 and national rankings. They have racked up six consecutive victories — tying a season-high — by a combined score of 36-6, including big conference wins against No. 3 California and No. 10 Stanford. USC’s overall record is now an impressive 16-2, and the team is undefeated in all five of its conference games.
Despite the team’s great form, associate head coach West Nott believes that the players are still “building up to their best tennis” as the season progresses, a sentiment shared by junior Giuliana Olmos.
“Our freshmen are getting more experience, everyone is starting to play better, and as time goes on, we’ll be working on our weaknesses and different parts of our game,” Olmos said. “There’s definitely always room for improvement.”
Arizona will aim for an upset today against the Women of Troy to get its season back on track. After a blistering 13-1 start, a 1-6 loss to Cal last Friday snapped the Wildcats’ nine-game winning streak. Another 1-6 loss to Stanford the day after handed them their first consecutive losses of the season. Arizona’s only other loss of the spring came at the hands of San Diego State, an opponent that USC shut out handily, 7-0, earlier last month.
In the same fixture last year, the Women of Troy hosted the Wildcats and chalked up a 4-0 victory. Since they will be on the road this time around, however, the players are prepping for some possibly unfamiliar conditions.
“We play in a high altitude [in Tucson], so the ball travels a little faster,” Nott said. “So we just want to be ready to play more aggressive tennis if we need to.”
USC’s great season so far is also reflected in the individual ITA rankings, as the Women of Troy continue to be ranked among the best in the nation. Olmos is ranked at a career high No. 11, while senior All-Americans Sabrina Santamaria and Zoë Scandalis are at No. 20 and No. 49, respectively. The remaining ranked Women of Troy are three talented freshmen. Meredith Xepoleas and Gabby Smith are ranked No. 64 and No. 65, and Madison Westby is No. 73. USC also has three ranked pairs, led by the No. 15 combination of Olmos and Scandalis. Sophomore Zoë Katz and Santamaria are just behind them at No. 19, and Katz’s partnership with senior Gabriella DeSimone is ranked at No. 30.
Nearing the end of such a successful season, it is easy for players and coaches alike to begin looking toward the Pac-12 and NCAA tournaments a little prematurely. This USC squad, however, is experiencing no such problems.
“We just take it one game at a time and try to do the best we can with each practice,” Nott said. “Things just naturally fall into place. I think when you have the right people with the right qualities and talent, things have a way of working themselves out.”
Nott also praised the team’s determination and level-headedness throughout the season, as the players kept their composure and continued to put in maximum effort after both wins and losses.
“What makes this team really good is that they don’t get too down and they don’t get too high,” Nott said. “They just work hard every day and have a great attitude.”
The Women of Troy begin their clash against Arizona at 1:30 p.m. today, and their match against Arizona State is scheduled for a 12 p.m. start on Saturday. The Sun Devils are also coming off  back-to-back losses, but they will host UCLA before facing USC.
After wrapping up their road trip, head coach Richard Gallien and the team will finally return to Marks Stadium for their first home match in almost three weeks next Friday against Utah.

The No. 10 USC baseball team looks to continue its winning streak this week against the Arizona Wildcats after taking two out of three games against the Washington Huskies last weekend.
The Trojans (22-6, 4-2 Pac-12) traveled to Seattle to face the Huskies (15-12, 2-7 Pac-12) and fought through a few tough games.
USC lost the first game on Friday by a score of 5-1, as Washington held the Trojans to only one run for the first time this season.
The team bounced back impressively, however, winning back-to-back extra inning games in order to capture its first away series in conference play this season.
Saturday marked the longest recorded game in USC baseball history, as it took 16 innings to finally decide a scoreless game.
The Trojans broke out with three runs in the top of the 16th behind an RBI single from sophomore Corey Dempster and a two-run RBI single from junior Timmy Robinson.
The extra runs proved to be essential, as the Huskies threatened the Trojans’ lead in the bottom of the 16th with a two-run home run from infielder Braden Bishop.
The Trojans came away unscathed, however, and tied the series at 1-1.
Sunday’s game did not lack excitement either, as the back-and-forth contest wasn’t decided until the 10th inning.
The Trojans and Huskies traded runs all afternoon and took a 3-3 tie into extra innings, where it took redshirt junior Bobby Stahel’s first collegiate home run to decide the contest.
Stahel’s solo home run gave the Trojans a 4-3 lead they wouldn’t relinquish, as redshirt freshman Alex Chavarria recorded his second-straight save to lock down the series for USC.
Head coach Dan Hubbs attributes the Trojans’ success in late innings to their maturity and ability to play fundamental baseball.
“We made some big pitches in some big spots. The kids kept fighting and finding ways to get on base,” Hubbs said.“Mentally, I think these kids understand how important each and every game is. There’s a lot of resiliency in this team because they’re an older group, and I think that has a lot to do with it.”
Looking ahead, the Trojans will travel to Tuscon to face the Wildcats on Thursday for their third conference series of the season.
Arizona is riding a strong wave of momentum, coming off back-to-back series sweeps against Pac-12 opponents Stanford and Oregon.
With a six-game winning streak, the Wildcats (22-6, 7-2 Pac-12) enter the series against the Trojans as the No. 25 team in the country.
Hubbs isn’t focused on Arizona’s recent success, however, as he treats every opponent the same no matter how many wins or losses they have.
“I don’t know if it matters who has momentum. I mean, we could say we have the momentum because we’re coming off two tough games late this weekend,” Hubbs said. “We’re a good team, and I know if we play well we’re going to be in a position to win against anyone.”
Arizona has benefited from one of the most prolific offenses in the nation thus far, led by junior middle infielders Scott Kingery and Kevin Newman.
Through their first 28 games, the Wildcats lead the country with a .332 batting average, but Kingery and Newman have been especially dominant.
Kingery leads all players with 53 base hits, and his .453 batting average ranks first in the country. Newman, while not quite as dominant as Kingery, has been impressive himself. He ranks fourth in the country with 49 base hits and 11th with a .426 batting average.
Though Hubbs admits that shutting down these two hitters will be a challenge, he believes his pitchers are up to the task.
“They can really hit, especially at the top of the lineup,” Hubbs said. “Kingery and Newman cause a lot of problems because they can run too, so we have to do our best to keep them off base. We’re not going to completely shut them down. In the reports we have, it says they’re going to get their hits, so we just have to make sure they’re not in big spots.”
Though the Trojans have benefited from consistent hitting and recently improved defense, Hubbs believes their pitching is still the key to their success moving forward.
“Going into Tuscon, we’re going to have to pitch better than we did in Seattle. Arizona, at their field, is going to exploit us if we don’t pitch better against them,” Hubbs said. “We just can’t give up seven runs and expect to win.”

First Lady Michelle Obama came under fire two days ago after attending BET’s (Black Entertainment Television) “Black Girls Rock” special event. The criticism came not from what she wore on the red carpet or what she said from behind the podium, but from the very fact that she was present. It’s improper, critics say, for Michelle Obama — a black woman — to be seen supporting, praising, uplifting, congratulating or encouraging other black women. From the indignation was born a counter movement: #WhiteGirlsRock.
This criticism, unsurprisingly, came mostly from groups of disgruntled white women and men, who felt as though women of their racial background were not being properly acknowledged or appreciated. In their opinion, to tell a young black woman she’s beautiful is to place all other non-black women beneath her. They believe that to congratulate a young black woman on finishing her higher education in a nation where she is historically unlikely to do so is telling her that white women can’t achieve as much. Apparently, the good-natured uplifting of one of the most objectified, stereotyped, sexualized and exploited people groups in the United States is crossing the line and venturing into the realm of racism.
Black girls do rock, and there has never been a point in the history of America when they’ve been told so. What damage could it possibly do to tell someone they are worth praising? Yes, white women rock too. We have the television, the movie screens, the advertisements, the magazines, the sororities and the history books to remind us.
#BlackGirlsRock is not racism; it’s reparation long overdue.
#WhiteGirlsRock is not retaliation; it’s a testament to fragility of white ego.
#AllGirlsRock when we come to accept and understand the above.

The issue isn’t of fragile egos but of double standards..promoting racial special interest, or gender for that matter, from the Nation’s First Lady is not appropriate…and where is the uproar over what the Kentucky player said?
YES!  and YES!  Great piece.

Earth Day is my favorite holiday. I’m part of the growing minority that doesn’t just recognize Earth Day on April 22, instead considering the entire month of April “Earth Month,” during which you too can celebrate with Environmental Student Assembly. I’m on the E-Board, so a shameless plug felt necessary.
In honor of Earth Month, I paid a visit to the Los Angeles Eco-Village, where every day is Earth Day. According to a handout I received on my tour, an Eco-Village is defined as a sustainable community that iterates human activities to the natural world harmlessly, while supporting healthy human development, among other criteria. The L.A. Eco-Village’s specific vision is “re-inventing how we live in the city.”
Forty residents live in the Los Angeles Eco-Village Intentional Community, which sets an example of sustainable living by minimizing environmental impact through various initiatives, including bikes, solar energy, compost and organic gardens. Though only 40 people reside in the official Intentional Community housing, an estimated 500 residents live within the Eco-Village’s two-block radius.
Due to typical Los Angeles parking problems, I was more than a few minutes late to the home’s weekly Saturday morning tour and feared an awkward entrance. Instead, I was warmly welcomed by both the bright paintings on the pavement leading up to the home and by Lois Arkin, the home’s founder and tour guide.
We were invited to peruse the items in the home’s “free” corner, which includes used cookware, clothes and books. Not the types to waste goods, the home’s residents place their unwanted items in the corner, and once a month, leftover goods are donated to Goodwill.
Overwhelmingly, my fellow tour attendees weren’t there simply because they were curious about the village, but with a specific purpose. Attendees were mostly on the younger side and included people working in relevant fields such as permaculture design, sustainable planning and food justice. A few were interested in moving into the intentional community, creating their own, dutifully taking notes on Lois’s commentary.
Arkin’s dream of forming an Intentional Community began in 1980; the community was officially founded in January 1993 in a retrofitted apartment complex that had been damaged by fire in the L.A. riots. For Arkin, this was part of the area’s draw — she wanted to prove that a strong community could be developed, even in a crime-ridden locale.
The first members of the L.A. Eco-Village Intentional Community built community with neighborhood residents through what Arkin called “positive gossip.” Instead of making conversation by talking about negative neighborhood occurrences, Intentional Community members spread positive news about neighbors.
Though it took 23 years for Arkin’s Intentional Community to come to fruition, she optimistically shared that she believes a similar community could be started in just a few years.
The community’s goals and practices are split into three categories: social, ecological and economic. Socially, all major decisions are made at weekly community meetings, and members eat vegetarian/vegan meals together a few times a week. If residents take issue with each other, they’re sent to the “Conflict Resolution Team.”
Many economic initiatives have spurred off the Eco-Village, such as the Food Lobby food cooperative and the Community Land Trust, a nonprofit that owns land under three neighborhood buildings.
Of course, the Eco-Village is known for its ecological initiatives. Residents plant gardens, compost their food waste, rely primarily on bikes for transportation and tend to bees and chickens. The community even has its own grey-water (recycled water) system.
In order to ensure that members are dedicated to the community’s cause of demonstrating sustainable living, becoming a community member is an extensive, multi-month process.
As a result, the community is full of members dedicated to outreach.

As much as I love environmental organizations, I usually think of them as niche groups; the problem with environmentally conscious groups is that they’re only appealing to people who already care about the environment, so they lack outreach potential.
The Eco-Village’s commitment to outreach and increasing environmental awareness is obvious, however. The home frequently houses demonstrations and talks, and even developed a learning garden for local schools.
These initiatives prove that the Eco-Village isn’t an exclusive environmentally conscious community, but an inclusive, educational space for the surrounding neighborhood. Sustainable development is development that can be continued through the indefinite future, and by sharing their tips with local residents, the Eco-Village ensures that their work will continue.

Though whipping up a batch of chocolate chip cookies might appear simple, professional bakers spend years perfecting this quintessential dessert. Passionate debates often ensue between people who prefer a thin and crispy cookie and those who are partial to a thick, chewy cookie. With a golden brown exterior, caramelized edges and a soft, sunken center, my version will satisfy even the most discerning chocolate chip cookie critic. The recipe is ideal for college students since it does not require a stand mixer and can be prepared all in one bowl.
Before you get started, be sure to read through my tips for becoming a better baker. Unlike savory cooking, baking is more science than art, a pursuit that requires attention to detail, precision and patience. Below, I have compiled simple recommendations that will help you instantly elevate your baking skills.
Flour power.
Flour contains proteins that give baked goods body and structure, allowing a batter to bind together and rise in the oven. Though measuring flour appears simple, a few extra tablespoons can make the difference between light, flaky biscuits and dense, chewy hockey pucks. Here’s how it works: as flour sits, it settles, increasing in density. As a result, a scoop of flour from the bottom of the bag can weigh twice as much as a scoop from the top. To ensure accuracy, use a large spoon or fork to gently fluff the flour in its storage container. This step aerates the flour before it is measured. Gently scoop a spoonful of flour into the measuring cup. When the flour reaches above the edge of the cup, use the straight edge of a knife to sweep off the excess flour.
Don’t skip the salt. 
Salt prevents baked goods from tasting flat, one-note or overly sweet. While a small pinch may appear inessential, salt brightens the flavors of all the other ingredients in a recipe. For my ultimate chocolate chip cookies, a sprinkle of flaky sea salt on top of each cookie brings out the decadent dark chocolate flavor and subdues the sweetness of the brown sugar.
Invest in quality ingredients. 
College students tend to be frugal, but splurging on a few specialty ingredients for baking is well worth the extra expense. Even though you might be satisfied with Hershey’s chocolate chips, investing in a good quality bar of dark chocolate will instantly take the flavor of your cookies from novice to professional. Unlike chocolate chips, which are tempered to help them retain their shape during baking, hand-cut chocolate chunks melt beautifully in the oven. The final product is a meltingly tender cookie with thin layers of chocolate packed into every bite, rather than a few chips scattered on top. Trader Joe’s offers excellent chocolate in bulk at student-friendly prices.
Brown is better. 
The anxiety that accompanies burning a beautiful pie or tart often leads novice bakers to under-bake their desserts. Allowing all of your pastries to bake until they are deeply golden enhances the appearance, flavor and texture of the final product. Rather than rely on a timer as the ultimate guide, use your eye to judge when something is ready. Often, the difference between a pale, anemic pastry and one with a gorgeous, mahogany crust is a matter of minutes (or seconds).
My Favorite Chocolate Chip Cookies
Recipe adapted from Chewy Gooey Crispy Crunchy by Alice Medrich
Ingredients :
• 2¼ cups all-purpose flour
• 1 teaspoon baking soda
• 1 cup (2 sticks) unsalted butter, melted and still warm
• ½ cup granulated sugar
• ½ cup packed brown sugar
• 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
• 1 teaspoon salt
• 2 large eggs, at room temperature
• 2 cups (12 ounces) hand-chopped dark chocolate chunks
• Flaky sea salt, for sprinkling (optional)
Yields about 30 cookies.
1. Combine the flour and baking soda in a medium bowl and mix together thoroughly with a whisk or fork. Set aside.
2. In a large bowl, combine the melted butter with the two sugars, vanilla and salt. Stir until the sugar has dissolved. Mix in the eggs one by one. Stir in the flour mixture just until all of the dry ingredients are moistened. Do not over mix. Fold in the chocolate chunks.
3. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least two hours, but preferably overnight. When ready to bake, remove the dough and let it soften to room temperature, about 30 minutes.
4. Preheat the oven to 375 degrees Fahrenheit. Line two baking sheets with parchment paper. Scoop rounded tablespoons of dough and place them three inches apart on the sheets. Sprinkle each cookie with a pinch of sea salt. Bake for nine to 11 minutes, or until the cookies are golden brown at the edges and the centers are still soft.
5. Remove the cookies from the oven and allow them to firm up on the sheets for one to two minutes. Remove the parchment paper from the sheets and allow the cookies to cool completely. The cookies can be stored in an airtight container for up to one week.

A rich display of talent sits in the Fisher Museum of Art this month, as the California Art Club presents its 104th Annual Gold Medal Juried Exhibition. From March 29 to April 19, the never-before-seen works from prominent national artists will be on campus.
The first impression when walking into the main gallery is the multitude of colors. More than 200 works are on display in the exhibit, yet the space does not feel cluttered. Deep, warm hues dominate the paintings, and though one might expect so much work in one room to be overwhelming, the exhibit is well curated, subjects and tones complimenting one another beautifully.
The Annual Gold Medal Juried Exhibition is not themed, which, according to the California Art Club’s website, allows artists to explore their art without constraint. But the exhibit is remarkably coherent, several subjects seeming to be repeated throughout the galleries.
Distinctly western landscapes dominate the show. Rolling canyons and coastal scenes are painted in brushy and ephemeral strokes, recalling the California Impressionist movement of the early 20th century. Also known as the Plein-Air movement, regional art was characterized by bright, loose brushwork. Featured artists were clearly inspired by this period in California art history.
Artists such as Amy Sidrane and Tim Solliday use the style to effectively capture the vast West Coast scenes. According to Sidrane’s website, her landscapes serve more than decorative purpose.
“I paint not only to cultivate my own artistic nature but also to bring attention to our need as a community to protect our fragile and vulnerable undeveloped landscape,” her website states.
The exhibit juxtaposes urban and natural subjects, giving the audience varying views of Southern California. Michael Obermayer’s “Sixth Street Bridge” sits harmoniously next to Kenn Backhaus’s “Desert’s Evening Reverie,” the deep hues of gold and blue in both paintings reflecting a Southern California night. William Wray’s “7 Eleven” is an interesting take on beauty in urban settings, playing with color and abstract shape to render a familiar scene magical and rare.
Some of the most interesting pieces, however, are those with the less traditional subjects. Cindy Jackson’s imposing sculpture, “Always Wanting/Never Enough,” presents suffering male and female figures covered in luxury brand logos. Jackson’s artist statement explains her intent behind the impressive piece:
“Completely covered with Louis Vuitton and Gucci logos, this couple is a powerful symbol of emotional entanglement, as well as the literal embodiment of consumerism and superficial pleasure/desire.”
Pieces like Jackson’s hanging marble sculpture of a bewildered baby face, appear rather unexpectedly in the exhibit. They do not quite seem to fit in with the more traditional pieces around them, but they provide a refreshing break from the paintings, which can become slightly repetitive.
The impressive range of pieces in the California Art Club’s exhibit is well worth checking out, even for just a few minutes between classes. The show mainly presents oil paintings, but there is a little bit of everything. Though some of the works are more original that others, and the exhibit features perhaps a few too many landscapes, the talent is undeniable. Lovers of impressionism will be inspired by the works paying homage to California’s Plein Air movement, and even those less familiar with art history will enjoy the regional tones of the exhibition.

In a New York Times op-ed published on March 24, Angelina Jolie discussed her decision to remove her ovaries and fallopian tubes preemptively to reduce her risk of ovarian cancer. On her decision to undergo surgery for cancer prevention, Jolie said, “I feel feminine and grounded in the choices I am making for myself and my family. I know my children will never have to say, ‘Mom died of ovarian cancer.’”
Just over two years ago, Jolie announced that she had a double mastectomy to decrease her chances of getting breast cancer. After genetic testing, she discovered that she had a mutated BRCA1 gene, which significantly increases the risk of breast and ovarian cancer and prompted her to make an informed and progressive decision. Jolie lost her mother, aunt and grandmother to cancer, and considering her family history and genetic background, her decision is a way of taking back her life and living it on her own terms — an inspiration in the realm of public health.
Jolie’s film career is a narrative of exceptionally strong female roles, and her persona off-screen follows suit. As a working mother of six, a Goodwill Ambassador for the United Nations Refugee Agency and a champion for ending sexual violence in war zones, Jolie has made a conscious effort to provide women with visibility. Sharing her story is simply in her nature of empowering women and informing them about health. In publishing what she describes as the “diary of a surgery,” her celebrity not only humanizes the impending threat of cancer but also responds to the public’s desensitized attitude to the female struggle in her individualized fight against the disease.
Jolie’s removal of her ovaries and fallopian tubes tells women of all ages that strength is not a matter of physicality. She conveys that a woman is not defined by her sexual organs or lack thereof. Femininity and female sexuality are no longer limited to the confines of a woman’s biology; instead, Jolie is the epitome of what it means to be knowledgeable, thoughtful and tenacious.
Yet there are significant setbacks in the removal of the ovaries and fallopian tubes, which her article ensures do not go unnoticed. Jolie will not be able to have any more children, and her hormone replacements caused her to go through menopause at age 39. Despite the mental and emotional side effects of early menopause, she said, “I feel at ease with whatever will come, not because I am strong but because this is a part of life. It is nothing to be feared.”
For women at risk of ovarian and breast cancer, Jolie’s article provides a sense of normalcy to the subject matter. By bringing cancer to a surface level discussion, the subsequent “Angelina Jolie effect” encourages women to take control of their health and reclaim ownership of their bodies.
Jolie stresses that an operation of this caliber, though preventive and effective, is a personal choice. It is important to note that results are contingent upon one’s family history, genetics and physical makeup. Evidently, Jolie’s use of her female agency has given a voice to speak against “the silent killer” that is ovarian cancer. In light of her efforts, the future of medicine will no longer make the word “female” associative with the term “cancer victim.” Jolie’s article starts a very important  conversation: a woman has choices. With or without surgery, she is not a bystander in her health struggle, but a heroine for her own future.

With the marijuana legalization movement gaining momentum in recent years, the safety, legality and accessibility of marijuana have steadily come under debate. On April 1, The New York Times reported that due to a “legal snarl,” Colorado would be forced to refund its marijuana taxes to marijuana growers, users and the public. This move makes everyone vulnerable, especially teenagers.
Though marijuana has been legalized in some form by 23 states, no state permits the recreational use of marijuana by those under the age of 18. But as with other substances that are illegal for minors, age is not a factor in engaging in certain activities. Due to the age prohibition, countless teens are being arrested and even incarcerated for possessing “weed.” Throwing teens into jail for illegal possession does not benefit the community and not the prevent such “crimes.”
In January, the American Academy of Pediatrics released a statement explaining that it believes in the decriminalization of the usage and possession of marijuana, but does not support its legalization. Doctors and professionals themselves have decided to take a seat right on the fence; this contradictory statement struggles to further push or settle the debate.
Due to minimal research on the drug, no one can yet confirm the exact effects of marijuana and whether or not the drug is fully safe for its users. There has been little verified information on the negative effects of marijuana on the health of adults, but studies have shown that marijuana has the possibility to delay adolescent brain development. This makes it difficult to pinpoint whether or not marijuana should legalized and what types of consequences one should face if using this substance unauthorized.
Many worry that the legalization of marijuana will increase the accessibility and usage of the drug in teens, and fears have arisen that youth will be exposed to illegal substances at very early ages. With 23 states already on board to legalize the substance, there is no way to completely ban marijuana in the United States.
At this point, marijuana’s presence is only going to increase in the future if studies are not further expanded and performed to test the effects of the drug. With growing support for legality, officials and medical personnel need to spearhead a movement to educate young adults about this drug. Marijuana can be harmful to one’s health, and this is the message that should be spread.
Communities — especially those who have a high rate of illegal substance use — should teach people at an early age about the possible consequences associated with all types of drugs and alcohol. It will be up to each state at this point to put controls on the content of educational advertisements to viewers and to deter illegal usage by limiting accessibility or price. Years ago, television, radio and billboards glorified smoking as being sexy and indulgent only to discover years later how detrimental and dangerous smoking actually is. Commercials like those by the “Truth” campaign aim to show teens the not-so-pretty side of cigarette use; there are definitely ways to combat the glamorization of possibly harmful substances as recent commercials have proved.
When it comes down to it, though marijuana’s effects on adolescents are somewhat inconclusive, marijuana should not be accessible to teens; at the same time, teens should not face severe punishment for usage or possession of the drug.
“Due to minimal research on the drug, no one can yet confirm the exact effects of marijuana and whether or not the drug is fully safe for its users“
It is very difficult to get approval of a study regarding cannabis in the U.S. unless it is designed to find harm. This is why over 90% of the thousands of studies funded by the NIH / NIDA were designed to find harm. Despite this only a handful of concerns where found. This in itself is a testament to its relative safety. Few substances when subject to this much scrutiny would show less harm, especially alcohol, tobacco and many pharmaceuticals.
“Overall, by comparison with other drugs used mainly for ‘recreational’ purposes, cannabis could be rated to be a relatively safe drug.”
Iversen L. Long-term effects of exposure to cannabis. Curr Opin Pharmacol. 2005. Review.


The large majority of adverse effects regarding cannabis are associated with (not necessarily caused by) heavy, regular, long-term adolescent use. This is the type of use that a legalized and regulated approach can reduce.
Currently kids have nearly unfettered, regular access to cannabis in our unregulated market. Over a third of teens say it would take less than a few hours to buy cannabis according to the National Center on Addiction and Substance Abuse. The federally funded Monitoring the Future Survey reports about 85% of high school seniors find marijuana “fairly easy to obtain”. Their figure has changed little since 1975, never dropping below 81% in three decades of national surveys.
It is regular use by teens that is the primary concern. Regular teen access will not increase with legalization. If there is any change, it will likely decrease as the main supply channels are moved above ground where they can be easily monitored and cannabis not purchased at will by teens as it is now. At the very least we would take the cannabis they are getting from the criminal drug dealer of unknown character, with unknown potency, unknown purity (it could be laced, contaminated, etc), who never ID’s, and put the supply in the hands of licensed, regulated retailers who are not going to try and also sell hard drugs, or even have access to hard drugs. We will also ensure that kids who happen to get caught in possession of cannabis, or worse, selling it to a friend, do not have their life ruined by the law intended to protect them.
The federal organization SAMHSA has shown that, despite greater acceptance, more lenient laws, and legalization for medical purposes, past year cannabis use by those aged 12 to 17 has dropped from 15.8% in 2002 to 13.4% in 2013. The perceived availability of cannabis has also dropped from 55% to 48.6% in this time. Multiple peer-reviewed studies have shown that medical marijuana laws have not led to increased teen usage [Choo et al. 2014; Lynne-Landsman et al. 2013; Harper et al. 2012; Anderson et al. 2012].
Teen cannabis usage dropped in Portugal when they decriminalized in 2001 [Hughes and Stevens. 2010]. The Netherlands have tolerated sales for years in ‘coffee shops’. As of 2011, both countries have lower overall past year usage rates, 3.6% and 5.4% respectively, than the U.S. which is 13.7% [WDR 2011]. Note that in the same time frame in which the war on drugs has been waging since the 1970’s, overall tobacco use has dropped from about 45% to 18%, without criminalizing millions of tobacco users, whereas overall cannabis use went up.
This peer-reviewed study has shown that lenient cannabis policies are not associated with elevated adolescent use:
“the data provide no evidence that strict marijuana laws in the United States provide protective effects compared to the similarly restrictive but less vigorously enforced laws in place in Canada, and the regulated access approach in the Netherlands. ”
Simons-Morton et al. Cross-national comparison of adolescent drinking and cannabis use in the United States, Canada, and the Netherlands. Int J Drug Policy. 2010.
Regardless, criminalizing adults for the possession of something that children should not have is not reasonable or consistent with our legal system.

The prohibition of marijuana provides teens with 24/7 access. It simply must end. 
If I were you and worried so much about “saving all of us” adults from ourselves, under the guise of protecting “The Children”, well then, I’d begin with the deadliest drug, which causes more broken homes, domestic violence, and traffic fatalities than all other drugs, combined, which is alcohol.
Yet alcohol remains perfectly legal, widely accepted, endlessly advertised, even glorified as an All American pastime.
Why doesn’t the much more prevalent, more widely abused, use of alcohol concern you much more than marijuana which is a relatively benign drug when compared to all other ones?
Protesting the legality of booze should be your number one priority if you are truly so concerned about “saving us all” from ourselves.
If you really want to protect families from a drug proven to destroy lives and families, then you should be up in arms, protesting the legality of booze.
Alcohol is the number one cause for traffic fatalities and domestic violence by a huge landslide.
Alcohol is also infused into literally a ton of deserts and fruity drinks that “The Children” find appealing.
Why doesn’t much more harmful yet perfectly legal use of alcohol concern you more than relatively benign marijuana? It should.
Regarding “The Children”,
Let’s not use “The Children” as an excuse to prohibit and criminalize  adult use of a natural plant far less dangerous than perfectly legal alcohol because nobody condones child use, and this is about allowing adults only to choose marijuana.
It’s our responsibility as parents by to educate our children on drug use. It’s not the government’s job to force Draconian Marijuana Laws upon every adult citizen under the guise of protecting “The Children”.
What message are we sending our children when it is easier for them to obtain marijuana now with it being illegal than it is for them to buy alcohol?
It doesn’t take the intellect of a genius to understand that stores card kids for I.D. Thugs and gang members do not. They also push the real hard drugs on children. Stores do not.
Marijuana legalization will make it harder for children to obtain it.
What message does it send our children when the President of The United States himself alongside a long list of successful people openly admit regular pot use at one time or another in their lives?
While we tell our kids how it will ruin their futures, and then insure so, by allowing our government to to jail our children and give them permanent criminal records when they get caught with a little Marijuana. Especially, if they are the wrong skin color or from the “wrong neighborhood”. Which in turn, ruins their chances of employment for life.
The Prohibition of Marijuana is the wrong message to send our children while we glorify, advertise and promote the much more dangerous use of alcohol like it’s an all American pastime.
The worst thing about marijuana and our children is what happens to them when they get caught up in the criminal justice system due to it’s prohibition.
Protect “The Children” and Our Neighborhoods Through The Legalization and Regulation of Marijuana Nationwide!
It’s really interesting to see the prohibitionist “mind” at work. First  Ms. Laczewski uses the tired old canard of “not enough research” to know. How tired and old is that particular red herring”? Well, I can’t
say for certain but I do know that the oldest reference to that excuse that I’ve found was published in Time Magazine in an article called “The A.M.A.: Marijuana Warning” which was published in the June 28, 1968 edition.  You’ll need to be a subscriber to read that article.

We’re pushing half a CENTURY of that tired old nag of a lame excuse. Exactly how many more decades are we supposed to give the epic failure of public policy credence and forcing our Country to suffer the consequences of this proven failure? But it’s a pretty darn good tactic. All the prohibitionists have to do is nothing to preserve the status quo.
Ms.Laczewski, with all due respect the only research that’s in short supply is credible research with the results that please the sycophants of prohibition. But it’s positively mind bending that you can argue “we
just don’t know” and then segue into the assertion that “the children” need to be warned about the dangers. It takes about 5 minutes inside my world for “the children” to realize that they’ve been lied to about cannabis.  You’re just not going to be able to convince them with more lies. You simply can not insist your irrational fears into becoming reality. The result is even worse because once “the children” realize that they’ve been sold a bill of goods the credibility of the prohibitionists is shot. The next natural conclusion for the immature mind is to believe that they’ve also been sold a bill of goods in the case of cocaine, heroin, methamphetamine, or whatever popular substance on the governments naughty lists. Would it really be that hard for you people to try to be honest about the subject?
PS there are exactly 4 States and one Federal District that have codified cannabis as an age restricted product. The age is 21, not 18. That’s the work of the legalizers, not the prohibitionist cohort.

No doubt about it, Israel lives is in a dangerous neighborhood, surrounded by countries that want her to cease to exist. She faces enormous hate from her neighbors, is regularly threatened with annihilation, and is forced to defend herself too often, most recently this past summer when thousands of missiles were being shot into civilian populated areas. Yet, Israel seeks to extend her hand out to the citizens of those same states, which time and again, attack her.
Even though Syria vowed to annihilate the state of Israel in 1947, even though Syria and Israel have fought three wars and numerous skirmishes and even though all sides in the Syrian Civil War profess a hatred of Israel, Israel nonetheless recognizes its humanitarian obligation to the human beings on the other side of a hostile border. Israel established a military field hospital in the Golan Heights just to serve Syrians wounded during the current civil war and sends the more complex cases to civilian hospitals. There are many Syrians injured in their civil war who wake up in an Israeli hospital having their life saved by the people they were taught to hate.
The Israeli NGO, Save a Child’s Heart (SACH), flies children with congenital heart defects from all over the developing world to Israel to perform free life-saving heart surgery. Every Tuesday, SACH holds an open cardiology clinic for Palestinian children from the West Bank and Gaza. Despite the ongoing conflict, Israelis understand that human life is above politics, and the Israeli government arranges safe border crossings, even during times of active conflict.
Even as the Hamas leadership continues to preach the destruction of the Jewish state, rebuilds their terror tunnels that were destroyed by Operation Protective Edge and test fires new rockets with which to attack Israel, they continue to benefit from Israeli humanitarian aid on a daily basis. Most ironically, days after the war this past summer, Hamas Prime Minister Haniyeh’s daughter traveled to Israel for medical treatment in an Israeli hospital.
All of this is not to say that Israel does no wrong. No democracy is absolutely perfect. The pro-Israel community on campus is not blind to the civilian deaths in Gaza this summer, nor do we all agree with every policy of the Israeli government in the West Bank. But making outrageous claims and seeking to demonize Israel on campus and in the media will do nothing to bring peace to a land and to two peoples who desperately need peace and mutual understanding. We choose to celebrate the best of both peoples, and we support the articulated policy of the Israeli and U.S. governments, to allow two peoples to have two states, living side by side in peace and with full security. Getting there is not be easy, but repeating distorted facts and attacking the other side is not going to get us there.
The pro-Israel community at USC has worked to educate countless student leaders on the importance of the U.S.-Israel relationship as strategic allies because of the countries’ shared commitment to democracy and significant economic partnership. As the only democracy in the Middle East, Israel shares a commitment to basic liberties such as free speech, freedom of religion, equal rights for women and the only country that guarantees LGBTQ rights.
The pro-Israel community has raised enough funds to purchase two solar panels for a poverty stricken village in Uganda via a fundraiser for the Israeli organization, Innovation: Africa, has sold bears to support SACH, and is holding a gala for Seeds of Peace — an organization that brings youth from conflict areas, including Israelis and Palestinians, together to try to form a lasting peace. These philanthropic and educational efforts demonstrate the USC pro-Israel community’s shared commitment with Israel to humanitarian endeavors and peaceful resolution.
As students, we are taught to think critically and to understand and other viewpoints. The pro-Israel students welcome you to join us and engage in a constructive dialogue.

Public Relations Director for Israel Leadership Council
What a thoughtful, well-reasoned, balanced piece!
I agree. Finally a balanced and truthful perspective from the Daily Trojan on Israel.
It’s about time!

This week, Muhammadu Buhari emerged victorious in Nigeria’s presidential election. Beaten by a 55 to 45 percent margin, incumbent President Goodluck Jonathan conceded defeat to Buhari. Jonathan’s defeat to the former military general is a major step forward for Africa’s most populous country. For the first time, there will be a peaceful transition of power from one ruling political party to another. In a country mired by constant military coups, threats of terror from groups such as Boko Haram and a budding yet unstable democracy, the election of Buhari and the acceptance of defeat by Jonathan should be lauded as tremendous signs of the maturity of Nigeria. The country is laying a foundation for a more stable and potent democratic nation.
Conflicting military rules and instability characterized Nigeria until 1999, when Jonathan’s People’s Democratic Party (PDP) took power. The PDP has ruled since, and Buhari’s win marks the party’s first loss. Ostensibly, Nigeria has been a democracy, but one test of a true democracy is the capacity to transition to another ruling regime. Post-apartheid South Africa experienced democracy with the election of Nelson Mandela in 1994, but the African National Congress has been in power ever since. It is difficult to call a nation a democracy when one party continues to hold power. With Buhari’s All Progressives Congress set to take control, Nigeria will hand over power without bloodshed or conflict. Regardless of where on the political spectrum either candidate stood, the fact that an opposition candidate won an undisputed election is a necessary democratic characteristic.
This historic Nigerian election might also signal the beginning of an increase in plurality in political parties. Now with true competition evident in elections, a plurality in political parties and the ability for differing groups to organize and represent their interests and platform is yet another sign of a burgeoning and strengthening democratic regime.
Nigeria is one of the most important countries in Africa. It has one of the most powerful, diverse economies, and the most people. This transition to a globally respected democracy elevates the nation as well as the entire region. Scholars and political scientists have long criticized what is called “African-style democracy,” which is to say, an all-too-powerful central leader of an omnipotent political party. Buhari’s rise to power sheds that image and demonstrates the ability to realize a true democracy.
Even with cause for celebration, the road in front of Buhari is not easy. Perhaps Buhari’s largest and most concerning issue at hand is the terrorist group Boko Haram. The ISIS-pledging organization has been reigning terror both domestically and abroad and is the biggest threat to the security and welfare of Nigeria. Buhari must find a way to mitigate the terror threats and squash any plans for action by Boko Haram. ISIS has become a cancer to the Middle East and is proving to be a factor in the development and failure of states in that region. The same narrative does not need to follow in Nigeria, and Buhari’s leadership will be tested to see if he can stave off the same fate. If Nigeria is to continue its rise as a democracy and as an economic power, Boko Haram must be removed and the threat of terror extinguished. With Boko Haram waging war both domestically and abroad and militias sparking sporadic unrest in the country, it will be a tall order for Buhari to temper militants and strengthen national security. Boko Haram has slain more than 7,300 civilians in the past year, and the terrorist group’s insurgency, coupled with the government’s lackadaisical response, is part of the reason Jonathan faced defeat. A new ruling party not only ushers in a new era of democracy in Nigeria, but also marks the beginning of a renewed effort for Nigerians to claim autonomy and cease the threats posed from outside forces.
Nigeria is proving the international doubters of its political abilities wrong. Its peaceful transition of power is a harbinger for its rise on the world stage.

If there’s anything college students love, it’s kicking back, watching Netflix and eating obscene amounts of food from the comfort of their dorms and apartments.
Since August 2014, Uber, one of the most popular driving services in the area has been offering its clients a way to continue their lazy Sundays by introducing a new delivery dining service, uberFRESH. Recently, this option has expanded to East L.A., which includes the USC campus and its surrounding neighborhoods. The transportation network, appears to be continuously changing the transportation industry by introducing and offering various services such as their recent addition of uberPOOL, a way for people to get to their location at a cheaper cost by carpooling with other riders. Their newest option, however, does not even involve you leaving your house.
UberFRESH is on the company’s mobile app on the far bottom, right side along the slider that starts with uberPOOL. The service is open to the East L.A. area Monday through Friday for lunch from 11 to ­2 p.m. and for dinner from 5­ to 8:30 p.m. A brunch menu is offered Saturdays and Sundays from 10­ to 2 p.m. Uber has created a list of meals available from restaurants around the L.A. area and their layout for the week can be found on their webpage, www.uberfreshla.com. Customers can scroll through several dining options each day and select the quantity of each meal they would like to order and then proceed to checkout. UberFRESH works similarly to the original driving services. Transactions are processed electronically through your card on file just like it is when you pay for your ride somewhere. A flat rate of $3 is charged in addition to the cost of the food to cover the delivery to your door.
The good thing about having a flat rate is that you can order as many dishes as you would like at one time for you and your friends and still only be charged $3 for delivery. And fare split, which is commonly used for friends splitting the cost of a ride, can also be used in this case to equally pay for food and delivery.
I would say the pricing is average to a bit pricey for college students. Uber is said to be carefully selecting dining options and partnering with various restaurants throughout the area.
This week’s menu features for example Truffle Wagyu Meatball Pasta from Taste on Melrose, a four-star dining location in West Hollywood, for $18 (plus the $3 delivery fee). Other meals this week include a Vegetarian Chopped Kale Salad for $12 from Coral Tree Cafe, a Chicken Teriyaki Bowl with Potstickers from Take a Bao for $14, and a Turkey Signature Sandwich from All About the Bread for $10.
This weekend’s brunch menu ranges from $8­12 and offers stay­at­home diners with pancakes, donuts, breakfast burritos or an egg white bowl.
Uber is a growingly popular service around campus; I doubt it will be long before we see more drivers pulling up to housing complexes but now with food in hand.
Next time your fridge is barren and the dining hall is just too far of a walk away, consider taking a peek at Uber’s menu for the day.

After living in Paris for two months, I think it’s safe to say I have absolutely everything I need. Well, everything except easy access to a good cup of coffee.
Don’t get me wrong — there are plenty of cafés here in Paris. In fact, you can’t walk down a single street without spotting at least one bustling café or brasserie (that’s the French word for brewery, but they’re basically small restaurants which often serve coffee too). But while in the U.S. one can find a casual café to grab a quick cup of coffee or do some homework for hours on end, such establishments are a little harder to spot in Paris. For starters, having your laptop open in a café, unless you’re in a one made explicitly for working (of which there are few), isn’t exactly commonplace. Neither is ordering coffee to-go (or emporter, as they say in French). And for constantly working, constantly caffeinated students, like myself, this poses a problem.
I’ll admit it — I’ve definitely sought out the Paris equivalent of Nature’s Brew and Ground Zero-type study cafés that all USC students are used to. There aren’t too many of them here in Paris, but when you discover them (I’ve found four), you realize they all have one thing in common: they’re always filled with foreigners. They’re mostly study abroad students who, like myself, just want to find a little taste of home as they attempt to transcribe their nineteenth century French literature homework. As one of my fellow café-goers loudly observed, “This place is expat-central!”
It’s not surprising that expatriates — especially students — would be drawn to places that remind them of home. But if my study abroad experience (and my frequent trips to the expat cafés) has taught me anything, it’s that there’s something to be said for weaning oneself off the subtle reminders of home while abroad. Though major challenges such as language barriers, new cuisine or different fashion are to be expected in a new country, sometimes the most difficult habits to break are the smaller things, like remaining quiet in the queue (or even using the word queue) and enjoying your coffee at a café rather than sprinting off with it to class.
Nevertheless, though I might not be enjoying my coffee in the same way I did back home, I’ve come to appreciate it an entirely different way. Now, coffee isn’t just a morning Coffee Bean run to get me through my 8 a.m. class or a Ground Zero All Nighter to get me through an assignment. Now, it’s just coffee for coffee’s sake — and I don’t mind at all.
