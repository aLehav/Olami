USC Hotel’s has made it its goal  to protect Earth’s natural resources for the health of future Trojans without compromising innovation and business. And now that is becoming a reality according to USC Hotel and USC Hospitality Executive Director Dirk De Jong. After a year of the Green Seal organization auditing its practices, the USC Hotel received a silver-level Green Seal certification in January. Looking forward, he wants the hotel to become a leading example of sustainable practices for their campus partners. 
The Hotel’s process of analyzing past trends in its resource utilization and pollution emittance aims to ensure that future generations have equal access to natural resources. Green Seal, a U.S. nonprofit, evaluates a hotel’s waste reduction, energy consumption, water management, pollution minimization and eco-friendly purchasing. 
De Jong said that to earn the certification, USC Hospitality aimed to reduce its carbon footprint and excess consumption of natural resources while maintaining a quality experience for it’s customers. 
“We always look at how any new initiative will meet the needs of the USC community, students, parents, staff, alumni — anybody that stays with us,” he said. 
Isabella Caltabiano, Undergraduate Student Government Sustainability Affairs Director, said that as part of the 2028 sustainability goals, President Carol Folt highlighted the importance of reviewing old buildings to incorporate more efficient use of energy and water while limiting waste. Using USC Hotel’s example as a critical shift toward sustainable infrastructure’s campus-wide catalytic expansion, Caltabiano said she hopes USC becomes a leading example to inspire students and universities to prioritize their environmental vision.
“There really is this global call for action,” said Caltabiano, a senior majoring in international relations. “USC will either be the leader and go first or will eventually transition to a sustainable university because everyone else will.”
De Jong said the process for fulfilling the Green Seal requirements for waste minimization, energy efficiency, water conservation, wastewater management and environmental responsibility is extensive. With the help of Green Seal and data scientists, USC Hotel collects and analyzes data on the hotel’s consumption of resources. 
USC Hotel has implemented a flow restrictor, a water-conserving device and replaced disposable products, such as plastic shampoo bottles, with reusable amenities. These changes positively impact the environment while still being attractive to guests, De Jong said.
As USC Hotel continues on the path of recycling and reducing waste to conserve resources, De Jong said it was critical that prospective guests know about the hotel’s sustainability efforts.  He said guests will feel a sense of internal contentment in knowing they made a greener choice.
“It is really a collective mindset. It is really about moving the community and society in that [sustainable] direction,” De Jong said. “Things need to be replaced after a certain amount of time. Instead of discarding them, we actually donate them to a homeless shelter.”  
De Jong said he hopes the USC Hotel can become an educational resource and a catalyst for other entities on campus to go green.
Caltabiano commended the efforts of USC Hospitality on its composting bins and said that the initiative would also be implemented in the University’s residential colleges. 
“I think the sustainable 2028 goals, which the administration is currently planning, are going to be very impactful,” Caltabiano said. “President Folt hopes to have USC become plastic-free within the next two years, and these policy changes made by the school will really be impacting the sustainable purchasing decisions that the everyday USC student will be doing.” 
Caltabiano is working toward policy changes at USC that would make eco-friendly options prevalent and easily accessible on campus.
“These larger infrastructure projects are changing the choices that students have in a positive way,” Caltabiano said. “Now you will not have the option of the less sustainable product at the USC Hotel and will not have the option of purchasing a plastic water bottle [on campus]. By changing the infrastructure and the living environment around us, we are going to start subconsciously making more sustainable choices.” 
Gabrielle Kim, a freshman majoring in political science, said that by renovating buildings like the USC Hotel with clean technologies and renewable energy sources, all people related to the hotel will become more conscious of their individual energy consumption.
“More of the impact from making these environmentally friendly infrastructures and buildings will not be a direct environmental change that is positive right away, just because there already has been so much damage done,” Kim said. “But I do think that it’s the mental impact that it’ll have that is greater … because I think once USC recognizes how it can be sustainable then it’ll incorporate that in other aspects … I think it’s just an attitude shift that will make a big difference.”
De Jong said USC Hotel will strive to maintain the silver level and continue making eco-friendly changes to move toward gold-level certification. The hotel has committed to advancing  environmental research and continuing to serve the needs of the Trojan community.
Correction: A previous version of this article reported that USC Hotel received an award. It earned a Green Seal certification, not an award. The Daily Trojan regrets this error.

More than 50 students and faculty protested an off-campus Westboro Baptist Church demonstration along Exposition Boulevard and Vermont Avenue Monday. Protesters wore rainbow-colored attire and carried signs that read “Love not hate” and “God loves.” 
Westboro Baptist, a group from Kansas known for its rallying against the LGBTQ community, picketed the Oscars Sunday near the Dolby Theater and stayed in Los Angeles through Monday to preach their message at USC and other schools in the area including UCLA, Alexander Hamilton High School and Manual Arts High School. The six church members who were not allowed to protest on campus, chose to protest the “sinful” behaviors of USC students. 
QuASA Executive Director Steven Vargas, led protesters in chants of “Love trumps hate” and “Homophobia has got to go,” as the group chanted gospel parodies of popular LGBTQ-positive songs like “Same Love” by rapper Macklemore and “Girls Like Girls” by gay musician Hayley Kiyoko, replacing lyrics with Bible verses and slurs targeting the community. 
“That’s where things are being taught: in the churches, in the schools … and it’s been wholly given over to sodomy, to fornication, to adultery,” said in an interview to the Daily Trojan Sam Phelps-Roper, an elder at the church. All of those things have become normalized, starting in the schools, starting in the churches, and it’s shameful.”
Another longtime church member,  Sam’s mother Shirley Phelps-Roper, emphasized the urgency of the protest to help save the souls of students.
“And so, what should we do?” Phelps-Roper said in an interview with the Daily Trojan. “If we don’t warn you, your blood will be on our hands at The Judgment.” 
Across the street from the church protest, the Queer and Ally Student Assembly, Trojan Advocates for Political Progress and OUTreach co-sponsored a counter-protest in collaboration with the LGBT Resource Center. 
Vargas said he was impressed by the student turnout. 
“It’s so great to see everyone who is of the LGBTQ community come together for something that we all need to stand up for,” Vargas said.
Vargas, who grew up in Fort Worth, Texas, said that the counter-protest empowered people whose home environments were less welcoming of LGBTQ identities and who found a community at USC.
“When we’re in our own hometown or wherever we grew up in, it’s just us, and we’re alone,” Vargas said. “Being able to stand up [to] this type of hate that we’ve lived with our entire lives together as a community is very powerful.” 
Kaitlyn King, a junior majoring in international relations, said she came to the protest to protect marginalized groups.
“It’s really important to promote positivity, because the Westboro Baptist Church is such a hateful group that’s trying to spread negativity,” King said. “We just want to be there to support the groups that they’re trying to marginalize.” 
The LGBT Resource Center held a safe space at the Student Union to provide a place to congregate for students who felt threatened by the protest.
“We offered the physical space but also the communal area where people are able to come together and just be with each other and know that no matter what, they are loved, they are cared for and that they matter,” said Blaise Guerriero, the graduate assistant of the LGBT Resource Center.
In a statement to the Daily Trojan, USC recognized the church’s First Amendment rights but criticized its message. 
“USC has zero tolerance for discrimination and bigotry of any kind,” the statement read. “Every member of the Trojan Family is treasured. We value inclusion and equity for all.” 
Two Department of Public Safety officers were present at the counter-protest to ensure students’ safety.
“There were no problems, no arrest,” Assistant Chief David Carlisle said. “DPS loosely monitored the situation, as did LAPD, but there was no law enforcement action taken or necessary.”
Participating in the protest felt personal for many students. Amelia Horney, a freshman majoring in composition, said the demonstration allowed her to better express her identity.
“I’ve felt extremely invisible because of what I look like; I’m a femme lesbian and people think that I look like I’m straight,” Horney said. “I want to make sure that everyone else feels like no matter where they’re from, no matter what they look like, [they] can feel safe to be their most authentic self.”
Onlookers expressed support for the counter-protest, honking car horns and waving at the crowd of students. 
James Witmer, a graduate student studying social work, applauded the diversity of the crowd. 
“We are accepting of everybody, no matter what your intersectionality is and your culture and who you identify with,” Witmer said. “We’re here to stay, and we accept every culture and every individual that there is.”
Natalie Lee, a senior majoring in music industry, emphasized the importance of demonstrating LGBTQ pride to the surrounding community. 
“We’re on the streets of L.A., and all of these people are passing by on their morning commutes and everything, and I think it’s important for them to see as well that we are here, we are queer,” Lee said. “We exist, and there’s power in numbers.”

Jeanie Buss is a Trojan alumna and voting member of USC’s Board of Trustees. She also happens to be the controlling owner of the Los Angeles Lakers after the high profile ousting of her brother and former controlling owner of the organization, Jim Buss, in March 2017.
Since she took the reins from her brother, the Lakers have been in a state of seemingly constant flux. Yet, as I write this column, they sit atop the Western Conference standings and have two of the best players in the NBA on their roster in Anthony Davis and LeBron James.
The current state of Buss’ Lakers may seem somewhat idyllic, but her overall tumultuous tenure as the final decision-maker of one of the world’s most recognizable sports brands tells a more complex story about the collectively shifting paradigm of gender politics.
The sports industry has traditionally been seen as hypermasculine, and sports are still considered one of the most socially acceptable forms of “masculine” entertainment to this day. The most celebrated athletes are mostly men, as are the executives who operate the leagues and organizations. This is equally true of the journalists and pundits who cover the happenings of the world of sports.
Keeping this in mind, Jeanie Buss’ powerful position in the industry provides a unique opportunity to analyze the expanding role that women appear to have in sports — and in society in general — and the effects it may have on that larger gender politics paradigm.
To understand how Buss fits into this discussion, it would be valuable to have some background knowledge on what has happened to the Lakers since she took over.
Buss acquired controlling ownership of the Lakers toward the end of the 2016-17 NBA season. Quickly thereafter, she hired former Lakers star Earvin “Magic” Johnson to serve as president of basketball operations and former high-powered sports agent Rob Pelinka to serve as the team’s general manager. Johnson’s official affiliation with the organization ended when he stepped down from his role in an impromptu pregame press conference in April.
In that press conference, Johnson indicated that a reason for his resignation involved a controversy with then-Lakers head coach Luke Walton, whom he wanted to fire. Buss, however, couldn’t bring herself to approve that decision.
“I don’t want to put her in the middle of [the situation with Walton], even though she said, ‘Hey, you can do what you want to do,’” Johnson said. “I know she has great love for him and great love for me.”
Johnson implied that his close relationship with Buss could not withstand a relatively simple disagreement over who ought to be the team’s head coach, and he additionally implied that he was leaving because he could not have his way. Johnson later went on various talk shows and indicated that the primary reason for his resignation was his frustration with Pelinka, but that does not excuse the fact that his first instinct was to blame Buss.
Due to the fact that Magic is a universally beloved sports icon, especially here in L.A., his controversial departure from the Lakers seems to have faded into nothingness as time has passed.
But this does not change the fact that his first instinct was to excuse himself from his responsibilities and obligations to the organization by throwing Jeanie Buss under the bus (pun intended). The incident is a microcosm of the gender politics paradigm shift that is confronting traditionally masculine facets of our world.
Women are increasingly taking and wielding power, and those who have grown accustomed to the traditionally masculine nature of corporate power are having to learn how to adapt to this new reality. It seems that those who are made uncomfortable by this shift prefer to take their ball and go home, as Magic Johnson did, but abdicating all responsibility is not an option for most people even if they are disgruntled. While this may seem problematic, that does not have to be the case.
Women having power over men is no more or less of a problem than men having power over women. These dynamics are not harmful in and of themselves considering that hierarchical power systems are an intrinsic part of the human social experience, especially in the sports industry.
The problems that may derive from the shifting dynamic will come if women are granted undeserved power due to their gender, as it will lead to a gender-based conflict where all those affected by this phenomenon are entitled to righteous resentment. That said, men have benefited from their gender status — at least in a social and financial sense ­— for all of human history, and a conflict of this nature would merely be a role-reversal of that which has persisted for far too long.
Hopefully, the shifting gender politics paradigm will settle in a place that allows for greater meritocracy to exist so that those who want and deserve to have power are granted that power regardless of whether they have a Y chromosome or not. This idealistic, meritocratic society is something to strive toward, despite the fact that there will surely be many speed bumps along the way.
In Jeanie Buss’ case, yes, she inherited her portion of ownership of the Lakers through her late father, Jerry Buss, but she had to fight to earn her position as controlling owner from her brother, who was handed the keys because he was the first born male. Clearly, she has benefitted from her last name, not her gender.
Jeanie Buss’ story is an example of how the existence of a powerful feminine figure operating in a traditionally masculine world can lead to messy confrontations, especially when that femininity is perceived as a threat to masculinity. But progress of this kind often comes at a cost. She is human and therefore imperfect, but as a USC alumna, the Trojan family should see her as a symbol of that progress and root for her to succeed, whether they’re Lakers fans or not.

The No. 1 USC men’s tennis team traveled to Columbus, Ohio to take on No. 2 Ohio State Sunday, falling 4-2 to the Buckeyes in a tightly contested matchup.
Ohio State was coming off a big win against then-No.1 Texas Feb. 1 and now looked to challenge the Trojans on their home courts. 
USC brought their top players to the contest: No. 1 junior Daniel Cukierman, No. 15 sophomore Mor Bulis, No. 24 senior Brandon Holt, No. 33 senior Riley Smith, No. 65 freshman Stefan Dostanic, No. 69 freshman Ryder Jackson and sophomore Bradley Frye. 
The Buckeyes started off strong, winning two of their three doubles matches against USC. Ohio State’s partnership of No. 70 sophomore James Trotter and freshman Justin Boulais narrowly beat the team of Bulis and Holt 7-6 in a tiebreaker. Additionally, No. 31 redshirt senior Kyle Seelig and No. 22 freshman Cannon Kingsley also beat the Trojans’ pair of Dostanic and Frye, 6-4. 
Down 0-1, the Trojans tried to bounce back in singles play with Cukierman set to face off against Kingsley. However, the nation’s top player was upset by the freshman Buckeye, losing in straight sets 6-4 and 6-2.
Building off the surprising win, No. 19 junior John McNally defeated Holt in 6-3 and 6-4 sets. It was Holt’s first loss of the season as the senior entered the weekend at 11-0 in doubles play and 7-0 in singles play on the season.
However, USC fought back. First, Bulis was able to win easily against Boulais in two straight 6-2 sets. Head coach Brett Masi applauded Bulis’ impressive performance. 
“Mor did a really good job in his singles match,” Masi said. “[He] played a great match, beating [Boulais], two in two [sets].”  
Smith kept the Trojans alive by knocking off Seelig in a tough match, winning 3-6, 6-1 and 6-4. Masi also praised Smith for his work against the ranked opponent.
“Riley obviously coming back from a set behind … winning in three sets — that was awesome,” Masi said.
However, the Trojans’ comeback attempt fell short there. Dostanic fell to Trotter 6-4, 6-7 (4) and 6-2 win to put USC away.
Despite the disappointing outcome and USC likely losing its top seed, Masi had some positive takeaways from the weekend. Overall, he was impressed by both Bulis and Smith and their contributions to the team effort.
“[Bulis and Smith did an] exceptional job, [we are] very proud of them,” Masi said. “Unfortunately, we just came up short.”
Masi attributed some of the issues the Trojans faced in Columbus to the fact that the matches were played indoors. USC has tended to play better on outdoor courts like those at David X. Marks Tennis Stadium, the Trojans’ home courts. 
“They struggled with the [climate] elements — I think everybody did,” Masi said about the indoor setting. “It is just getting used to the elements of playing in different environments. Like indoors, as opposed to playing outdoors, is just a different type of tennis, and [we] got to get acclimated to it.”
USC turns its focus to Tuesday’s match against Wisconsin in Madison, Wis., and the ITA National Team Indoor Tournament, also set in Madison, Friday through Monday.

The USC’s women’s basketball team earned a split in a pair of tough conference road games this weekend, defeating Cal 75-67 Friday before falling to No. 6 Stanford 79-59 Sunday.
Friday’s win was spearheaded by a balanced USC scoring attack that featured four players with double-digit points. The group was led by freshman center Angel Jackson, who had 19 points on 11 shots.
Jackson and the Trojans benefited from strong showings by graduate guard Aliyah Jeune and freshman forward Alissa Pili, who finished with 18 and 17 points, respectively. 
Pili continues to impress for USC as she remains the Trojans’ leading scorer in her true freshman season, averaging 14.4 points per game while shooting 48.3% from the field. 
Pili has certainly turned heads in her short time at USC, but head coach Mark Trakh wants to see continued improvement from her as she continues to acclimate to the collegiate level and expand her skillset moving forward.
Pili is equally as demanding of herself. After the road trip, she expressed a desire to improve her vision and passing accuracy when she receives extra attention in the post from opposing defenses.
Pili and the Trojans won the turnover battle and received significant contributions off the bench in Friday’s win, a stark contrast from Sunday’s disappointing loss. The Trojans fell in a hole early as the Cardinal seized the lead in the opening minute and never looked back. 
Stanford led by as many as 33  points late in the first half, hitting shot after shot while playing smothering defense on the other end. After just 10 minutes of action, Stanford was leading 28-6, and the Trojans went into the locker room after an abysmal first half trailing 49-21.
A bright spot for Trakh and the Trojans was another solid showing from Pili, who scored in double digits for the eighth straight game and finished with a team-high 12 points. 
Pili was pleased with the team’s effort in the second half but said the team needs to do a better job of being mentally prepared right out of the gate against teams with multiple offensive weapons. 
The second half was much better for USC, as it outscored the Cardinal 38-30 and held Stanford to just one made 3-pointer in the final two quarters compared to 10 in the first half. 
Trakh was encouraged by his team’s second-half resilience, commending its ability to fight back despite not hitting many shots in the first half.
“Once our young kids settled down, we did fine,” Trakh said. “We’re using these games as learning experiences. Nobody has four freshmen and one sophomore out there for prolonged minutes like we do.”
The Trojans’ bench production was concerning Sunday as Stanford second unit outscored USC’s reserve 36-17 — compared to a mark of 25-8 in favor of USC against Cal.

Religious institutions have flourished in the United States precisely because they are not intrinsically tied to the government. On average, Americans are far more religious than adults in other wealthy countries. According to a 2018 Pew Research study, this country is the only one with above-average GDP per capita and above-average frequency of daily prayer.
Yes, many legislators have religious motivations, but as a whole, religious leaders are separate individuals from political leaders. No church has punitive power over citizens, and the laws of the Bible are not binding on individuals unless they also exist in the secular legislative statutes. In other words, separation of church and state is beneficial to both society and religion. 
But how long will it exist? Whether the president makes a religious comment, a senator invokes his religion as justification for a decision or the pope announces a policy change, it seems that the separation between church and state is eroding quickly. One such erosion is the question of whether public tax dollars should be used to fund religious schools. 
This was the issue at hand when the Supreme Court heard oral arguments late last month in the case of Espinoza v. Montana. A 2015 Montana law provided tax credits to families who sent their children to private schools, including religious ones. As a result, public funds were indirectly being used to fund religious schools. The legislature passed a law preventing the program from operating with religious schools, effectively barring those schools from participating in the tax credit program. Religious school families then sued, claiming religious discrimination. 
The central problem generates the following two questions: Can public funds be used to fund private religious schools? Can the state allow funding of some private institutions but not others on the basis of religion? 
The First Amendment in and of itself causes some problems. The Establishment Clause, which prohibits the government from valuing one religion over another, conflates with the Free-Exercise Clause, which allows all individuals to practice their religion free from government discrimination. 
On one hand, using tax dollars to fund a religious school essentially establishes a connection between the government and a religion. But perhaps just as compelling of an argument is the discrimination point based on the Free-Exercise Clause: The government is refusing to fund a school just because it is religious in nature. 
Constitutional arguments aside, this case uncovers a lesson that has long been neglected in public discourse: Both sides have valid arguments. There is not a question of morality or character of either party in this action. 
Both sides of this issue raised concerns that, if looked at objectively, are real causes for grievances. While the sentiment against Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos runs high in California, it may be eye-opening to look at the case from her allies’ perspective before shunning any of their positions as being “voucher schemes” or attempting to indoctrinate American youth, as some groups wrote in their amicus briefs to the Court. In fact, making such arguments shows a lack of understanding of the entire issue. 
Consider the following similar scenario: USC is a secular institution and does not consider itself a religiously-affiliated school. It logically follows that tuition money should not be spent on religious education. That said, there are numerous religious organizations on campus, and they, like any other student organization, have the right to apply for funding from the Undergraduate Student Government. Therefore, USC is using tuition to fund religious organizations. That’s the plaintiff’s position in the Espinoza case. 
It’s easy to write off an opponent’s arguments as nefarious. However, perhaps increased political polarization has indoctrinated popular culture into believing that political opponents do not truly want what is best for the country. Americans may disagree with proponents of public funding for religious organizations, but they should refuse to attack their character and dismiss their entire argument on moral grounds. 
Ultimately, the merits of the arguments will be decided by the Supreme Court. Nevertheless, simple conversation and debate can dispel many of the ad hominem attacks made by both sides. It’s unfortunate these conversations are not happening.

On any given day, a student walking along Trousdale Parkway may see future (and sometimes current) award-winning scientists, NFL players, Hollywood producers, Silicon Valley CEOs, lawmakers and world-renowned dancers. 
What they do not see on Trousdale are people from the local community enjoying USC’s campus. This is an area USC is lacking in, especially compared to other major urban universities. Although the University is technically open to all, do nearby residents feel welcome?
Schools like the University of Pennsylvania, Boston University and Columbia University have developed their campuses in a way that is highly accessible and welcoming to local residents. In the cases of Penn and Columbia, doing so has even improved the surrounding neighborhoods. Comparatively, USC is akin to an island in South Los Angeles, and it will continue to be that way unless the school immerses itself in the community.
It must be recognized that some groups on campus are making progress toward harmonizing USC with L.A. Currently, the Price Center for Social Innovation has partnered with the Los Angeles Promise Zone, a collective impact project to fight urban poverty, in areas such as Pico-Union. Additionally, Troy Camp, which provides mentorship to South L.A. students, hosts events both on and off campus, helping to bridge the University and surrounding community. However, opening campus to the city must become a more normalized concept, offering more opportunities to Angelenos at USC.
The University could increase community interaction by creating programs where professors can give seminars to adults in the community as well as regularly-scheduled weekend events where USC students can mentor, tutor, do arts and crafts or play games with local children. Larger campus affairs, such as guest speakers, movie screenings, shows or conferences should be more widely promoted and open to the public.
Administrators can also make campus a more visible and inclusive place by making appearances at schools or community events. If USC’s leaders outwardly show compassion toward South L.A. residents and neighborhoods, they will increasingly view the University as a leader and an interactive hub for the community.
Furthermore, future urban planning for the University should include a more welcoming, open outlook in its goals. Although the University Park Campus is open to all, USC is currently very disconnected from local residents, sheltered by gates and two major roadways: Figueroa Street and Exposition Boulevard. 
As the University continues to expand into the neighborhood in future years, it should extend active streets into the campus and make the transition between USC and the urban surroundings more fluid, which will hopefully lead to a more united University Park neighborhood. This integration of USC and the surrounding neighborhood may also lead to the added positives of economic improvement and urban development in the area, which benefits everyone. Certainly, any potential convergence must be done with proper input and agreement from the community and its leaders.
The University, its students and its faculty will see further benefits from a more open University Park Campus. It will gain more service opportunities and chances to cultivate student leadership skills, as well as the chance to learn experientially and see perspectives USC students may not get every day.
As the sixth-most diverse university in the country according to a Priceonomics study, USC undoubtedly has one of the most talented and diverse student bodies, which makes for a stimulating and engaging learning environment. But it could become a much more diverse community and a much more enriched and vibrant university if USC provided more access to campus for residents of South L.A. There are future leaders in the local community, and USC owes it to Angelenos to provide increased access to its campus and resources.

As a Twitter enthusiast, I’m unfortunately familiar with one of  the internet’s least favorite public figures: Kaitlin Bennett, otherwise known as “Kent State Gun Girl.” For those lucky enough to have avoided her this long, Bennett is a social media activist who proudly champions gun rights and the pro-life movement and caught the eye of the internet for open-carrying an AR-10 rifle at Kent State University after graduating. 
I normally do my best to ignore her provocative, polarizing content, but on the first day of the new year, she tweeted something that I couldn’t scroll past. Her post read: “My haters memed me into a lucrative career that lets me travel the country, do what I want and have a platform to be heard. Thanks so much to everyone that gave me free advertising in 2019. Let’s do it again this year. #GunGirl2020.”
What immediately came to mind was a piece of conventional wisdom I often heard as a child: When someone is picking on you on the playground, the best thing you can do is not give them the reaction they’re hoping for. Play into it and you only fuel the bullying. The same holds true for internet trolls: The harsh reality is that we have a hand in bringing these trolls to prominence. 
Bennett has always held radical views, but it was only when we gave her engagement in the form of knee-jerk social media outrage that she was rebranded as a polarizing public figure. It was only then that she was able to leverage her internet infamy into merchandise, a job with InfoWars and a YouTube channel with close to half a million subscribers. 
She’s not alone in reaping the benefits of this twisted business model. Remember Bagel Boss, the Long Island resident who went on a misogynistic rant about his height and dating in a viral video? Well, he went on to gain a substantial Twitter following and scored a gig to fight another viral star in an Atlantic City boxing match. 
Let’s break this down. I want to identify what is distinct about this phenomenon — why is it that, when it comes to internet trolls, our collective scolding of them is particularly shortsighted?
The thing is, retweeting and chastising Bennett’s online content is not the same as voicing your opinion on a controversial issue or participating in an educated discourse between two or more rational agents. Contentious social debates are often multi-faceted and, well, contended; they aren’t conducive to the knee-jerk, emotionally-fuelled responses that characterize public sentiment toward viral content. 
The content that goes viral and spurs overt outrage is often the content that is one-dimensional and overtly wrong. That’s precisely why it is able to elicit such a sweepingly negative response — whether it’s leaked footage, a soundbite or a tweet, the general moral conscience is on one side of it all. We become united in outrage and that can be gratifying, sure, but it is far more gratifying to the orchestrator of said outrage.
Our outcry is in vain. Neither Bennett, nor public figures like her nor her devout fanbase is interested in being convinced; They are interested in pissing you off and using your anger as leverage. And when we fall for it, we are letting toxic, divisive people profit off of negative attention. The court of public opinion has no real enforcement, and when it comes to internet trolls, it’s time we start being strategic. There is a fine line to toe between reasonable backlash and free engagement.
I’m not saying we should keep quiet on issues that impassion and move us. I’m definitely not saying we should be held fully accountable for the notoriety of internet trolls. I’m just acknowledging the very real relationship between the attention we give such trolls and the benefits they reap. Even with charitable intentions, the desired outcome of speaking out against trolls often misses its mark, and unfortunately, those who woke-scold end up accomplishing the opposite of what they intended. 
When you have a polarizing figure whose identity rests on their lack of substantive argument and dependence on provocation, when it becomes clear that the growth of their brand rests on our reactions, think twice before playing into it. In real life, you wouldn’t argue with someone wearing earplugs and you wouldn’t give the bully on the playground the attention they are so obviously seeking. Collectively, we have the power to manage what breaches the mainstream — we should start using it.

There was a buzz in the air Saturday night as artsy, creative types — clad in glasses, mustard cardigans and chukka boots — gathered at The Theatre at Ace Hotel for Pop-Up Magazine’s Winter 2020 issue. As advertised in the program, it was a night filled with “cabaret, candles, crushes, dumpster diving, soap operas, small talk, town halls, homecomings, new jobs, and more!” 
Pop-Up Magazine is a project that started in 2009 as a side hobby of Douglas McGray, Lauren Smith, Derek Fagerstrom, Evan Ratliff and Maili Holiman. They wanted to find a way to bring together people from various artistic disciplines to tell stories in unconventional ways. The first show was at a small-scale theater of around 300 seats in San Francisco; since then, their audience has tripled and grown into a full-scale collaboration between people from all walks of life: writers, radio producers, photographers, filmmakers and illustrators. 
In a typical Pop-Up Magazine show, a series of guests perform new, mostly reported stories, accompanied by videos or animations and a live original score courtesy of Magik*Magik Orchestra. After the show, performers and audience members are encouraged to mingle and rub elbows. Recording is strictly prohibited; unlike most shows nowadays that are filmed for posterity and later posted online, not a single Pop-Up Magazine show is ever documented, so if you miss it, you miss it. Past contributors have included author Michael Pollan, filmmaker Ava DuVernay, comedian Kumail Nanjiani and chef Samin Nosrat.
The stories that the guests tell strike just the right balance between lighthearted and serious, entertaining and informative. That night, for example, Mexican American filmmaker Isabel Castro told the story of Scott Warren, who was arrested and put on trial for helping illegal immigrants cross the border, augmented with documentary footage she had captured while visiting the town of Ajo, Ariz. She was immediately followed by comedian Catherine Cohen, who dazzled onstage in a sequin dress and knee-high boots, belting out a dramatic cabaret performance that begged Urban Outfitters and Brandy Melville to make clothes in her size so that they could just “take her money.”
Many of the performers opt to tell personal stories from the heart. Artist Diana Markosian hired actors to recreate her turbulent childhood in Russia and Santa Barbara; rapper Jinho “The Piper” Ferreira ruminated on his time as a member of the Alameda County Sheriff’s Office; artist and filmmaker Jon-Sesrie Goff delved into the deep, layered history of a plot of land in South Carolina he would one day inherit; and painter Esther Pearl Watson animated her own art to tell the story of her dad’s obsession with building a UFO, with beautiful abstract brushstrokes rendering the neighborhood in Texas where she grew up. 
But there is plenty of playful merriment to lighten the mood as well. Illustrator Liana Finck, who regularly contributes cartoons to The New Yorker, presented a short animated video exploring the disparities between what people say and what they really mean — a premise rich in humor. A story written by comedian Jo Firestone, who, unfortunately, was sick at home and unable to perform, was performed by podcast host Rose Eveleth with grace and aplomb. Eveleth instilled her story, about the power of scented candles to instantly transport you to a specific moment in time, with just the right amount of fun and whimsy. 
Saturday night’s show ended with filmmaker Cecilia Aldarondo’s story of a man she’d had a raging crush on in high school but who barely knew she existed, culminating with her sitting down with him 20 years later and reading him a poem that she wrote him. Aldarondo’s willingness to revisit the depths of her lonely, awkward teenage years and reflect on her growth and maturation made for a rather poignant ending when her husband joined her onstage. 
The fact that no Pop-Up Magazine show is recorded lends an ephemeral, fleeting quality to the performances which is what live theater  should be all about. Audiences walk out knowing they’ve witnessed something special, something they won’t be able to revisit later on YouTube. The only way you can relive it is to talk about it with others who were there with you — and that’s the purpose of any magazine, no matter the medium.
