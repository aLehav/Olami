The No. 3 USC men’s tennis team has a chance to go undefeated in Pac-10 play for the first time since 1987 as it takes on No. 9 UCLA in its final match of the regular season.
Youth served · Despite his inexperience, freshman Ray Sarmiento has been instrumental in leading USC to an undefeated mark in Pac-10 play. - Mannat Saini | Daily Trojan 
Last season, the Trojans fell just short of a Pac-10 championship in a crushing 4-3 loss against the Bruins. But this year, USC could walk away with sole possession of the title, provided it can return home with a win in hand.
“We’ve won a lot of big matches and we’d love to win this but we have to look at this as just another match,” said USC coach Peter Smith.
The Trojans (20-2, 5-0) beat the Bruins in a full-house spectacle March 2, walking away with a convincing 5-2 victory at home in Marks Tennis Stadium.
“We’ve got to do the same thing that we’ve been doing,” said freshman Ray Sarmiento. “It’s just another match so we’ve got to prepare like it. Give it all we got, because it’s our last match of the season.”
Smith echoed this sentiment, insisting the team finish out the season strong despite already clinching a share of the conference crown.
Smith said he is not overly concerned with records or win-streaks, though that is not stopping him from approaching this match seriously.
“I don’t care to be undefeated in anything,” Smith said. “The only thing I care to be undefeated in is the NCAA tournament, because when you lose, you gain. You learn when you lose. You don’t want to lose but you also don’t want to shy away from it.”
Yet ending with a win over UCLA would certainly taste sweet.
“It’d mean a lot, especially winning on their court,” Sarmiento said. “It’s our rival across town.”
Smith hopes his young but experienced group does not get hung up on the rivalry.
“The key thing for us is don’t over-think it,” Smith said. “Go out and trust yourself and play tennis. These guys are on this team for a reason.”
But the Trojans have more to come, first with the Pac-10 tournament and their eyes on the prize — a third consecutive NCAA title.
“I’m thinking toward the end of May,” Sarmiento said. “That’s the big picture, that’s the main focus.”
First serve is at 3 p.m. at the Los Angeles Tennis Center.

USC junior pitcher Andrew Triggs entered Thursday’s game against Washington with an ERA of 5.13. He finished it with an ERA of 4.52.
Triggs pitched his and the Trojans’ (17-20, 7-6) second complete game of the season,  throwing nine innings of one-run ball as USC took game one of a three-game set against the Huskies (11-24, 2-8).
His one allowed run came in the very first inning off an RBI double. Triggs shut down the Huskies offense after that.
The righty recorded a career-high 10 strikeouts, allowing just five hits and issuing just one free pass. Triggs would allow just six base runners and retired the Huskies in order in the third, fourth, fifth and ninth, including 11 straight at one point.
Washington starter Geoff Brown was terrific, as well. The lefty scattered two runs and six hits over eight innings, striking out four and walking just one. But the two runs were all the Trojans needed.
Both runs came in the second for the Trojans. With two outs, sophomore third baseman Adam Landecker singled up the middle, and freshman designated hitter Kevin Swick walked. Up stepped true-freshman shortstop James Roberts, who delivered a two-run double into the gap in right center.
That was it for the scoring on both sides, and for most action in general throughout the game. Washington coach Lindsay Meggs was ejected in the seventh inning, but otherwise Triggs and Brown kept the game moving quickly.
How about a score?

USC concluded its final practice of the spring session early Thursday morning, as the team put the finishing touches on preparation for the annual spring game Saturday.
Playing without pads, players went through a walk through-type practice in an effort to stay fresh for Saturday’s scrimmage at the Coliseum.
In spite of the slower pace, USC coach Lane Kiffin remained confident Saturday’s session will be intense.
“I anticipate it to be a lot of plays, I anticipate it being longer, I anticipate it being a lot of contact and very physical,” Kiffin said.
But with 14 practices in the books and the team nearing the end of its spring practice season, Kiffin made sure to note the team’s improved play.
“I think we have gotten better on defense,” he said. “I think we are playing more sound and I think we tackle more than we did a year ago. I think that will pay off for us.”
On Thursday, junior quarterback Matt Barkley and sophomore wide receiver Robert Woods proved yet again to be a dynamic pair on offense, but the defense outshone an injury-riddled unit still.

Several key players, including senior tailback Marc Tyler, sophomore tailback Dillon Baxter, junior cornerback Tony Burnett and sophomore safety Demetrius Wright, returned to the practice field Thursday after suffering various injuries in recent weeks.
Though Tyler suffered a concussion earlier, Kiffin said he passed all tests and was retested to confirm he is good to go for the spring game.
Baxter also resumed team-related activities after suffering from an ankle injury. He was cleared to play Saturday.
Burnett and Wright were welcomed back from the sidelines after suffering injuries Saturday. “I think there’s a number of guys that are right on the border that we pushed back today and that I think that will be ready to go Saturday, so I think we’ll have a lot of guys out there compared to normal,” Kiffin said.

After undergoing foot surgery in February, redshirt freshman wide receiver Kyle Prater participated in practice for the first time this spring. Prater, who will participate in Saturday’s spring game, was glad to be back on the field.
“Saturday, I know I’m definitely not going to strain myself,” Prater said. “I’m going to see what I did today and go from there.”
Despite not getting much playing time in recent months, and earning a reputation as “injury-prone,” he insisted he wasn’t rattled.
“I can’t worry about what people say and I can only worry about what I can control,” Prater said. “I know what I can do and I know I can contribute to the team.”
Prater played on the second string during Thursday’s practice, but did not participate in the scrimmages. According to Kiffin he was cleared to participate in full-speed running drills, but not in any contact drills. USC’s annual spring game will be held Saturday at 1 p.m. but will not be televised or streamed live on USCTrojans.com. Admission is free for students and $10 for the public.

Right about now, hundreds of thousands of high school seniors are making their life-changing decision about which college to attend. Only 3,000 will make the right choice and come to our side of warm, sunny Los Angeles for the next four years.
I remember when I made my decision, and then changed it and then changed it back in the span of five minutes. It was one of the best decisions I have ever made.
But now, four years later, my time here is coming to an end. After a terrific, some will say legendary, others will say unreplicable, dynastic run for the last two years at Spittin’ Sports, the moment has come to say goodbye. Take a moment to grab a Kleenex and cry — it’s okay. It’s only natural.
Before I go, I want to leave the high school seniors from around the world who are attending USC in the fall (because I know Spittin’ Sports has a huge global presence; I found a hooker in the Red Light District in Amsterdam reading it one time), as well as current students with some tips on how to get the most, from an athletic standpoint, out of your time at USC.
You incoming freshmen might think you’re ready to be Trojans, but not so fast. Here’s what you need to know how to become a great Trojan like me.
First and foremost, no song is requested more at USC sporting events than Fleetwood Mac’s hit, “Tusk.”
You might be thinking, “Why is a song about Mic Fleetwood’s junk (seriously, look it up, big rumor out on the Internet) one of the school’s most celebrated songs?” Well, us clever USC students had a little fun and changed the words around a bit. You’ll have to go to a sporting event to truly appreciate it, but it goes along the lines of really not liking a certain school from across town.
And that’s a rule. In fact, you are encouraged to remind yourself and everyone around you that you do not like that institution by singing about it at any sporting event, even when we are playing Fairfield University in women’s lacrosse.
Next, to be a good Trojan, you must line up outside the Coliseum at least two hours before the gates open (so about four hours before the game starts) to get good seats for football games during your first two years. This is almost a rite of passage. I’m not going to tell you why you should only do this for the first two years, but once you become a junior, you’ll understand.
Also, if USC legally qualifies for the Rose Bowl at any point during your time at USC, you need to go. I failed to go when we qualified my freshman and sophomore years with the expectation I would wait until we inevitably played in the national championship to go to the big game. But thanks to the NCAA, that never happened.
Which brings me to another important point. USC is not well-liked by a lot of people in the country, much like Notre Dame, because it is so good at everything, unlike Notre Dame. It is totally okay to be arrogant and be comfortable about it. Mind you, there’s a fine line between arrogance and ignorance or repugnance, but you’ll learn the difference.
We’ve won three straight national championships in men’s water polo, two straight national titles in men’s tennis, we’re the reigning national champion in women’s water polo and the women’s soccer and golf teams have won national championships in the last four seasons.
That’s not to mention men’s volleyball, which has a better record than president Barack Obama did in the first round of his March Madness bracket. So, by the transitive property, yes, the team is better than the President.
With all these teams enjoying such great success, don’t go all four years without going to a variety of games. Football and Kevin O’Neill bobblehead night might rule the headlines, but there are so many hidden athletic gems at USC.
USC is an institution with one of the richest (literally and figuratively) sporting backgrounds in the country. Football and basketball will climb back up there in a few years. In the meantime, think about how awesome it would be to channel your inner-hipster and tell your grandkids that you saw Amy Rodriguez playing soccer before the country knew Amy Rodriguez playing soccer was cool.
Which brings me to my final point. I know USC will never be the same without Spittin’ Sports to get you through class, but do your best to enjoy the four (or five?) years of your life here and take in as much as possible. I couldn’t have asked for anything more in my four years, but it’s time to move on to different pastures, so I leave you with two words:
Fight on.
 
“Spittin’ Sports” ran Fridays. To comment on this article email Kenny at klegan@usc.edu or visit dailytrojan.com.
Go Broncos?
Great work Kenny…eager to talk sports with a brew when you get home.
On Wisconsin!
I’m not much for sports, but yours were the only sports articles I looked forward to reading (no offense to  the other reporters, haha). I’m really going to miss your column on Fridays. Fight on!
Classic legan, it’s been a privilege and an honor to be a dedicated reader for you for two years, I will never forget the sam cassell alien line, and glad i could contribute some punchlines. Look forward to reading your articles in the future, unless it’s about chicago
Kenny, I will only read your articles if they are about chicago.
Also channel your inner hipster and say you were reading Kenny Legan articles before he was writing for ESPN.
Great article. I’m assuming you learned to write like that at Annenberg.
congrats on a great summary and 4 years; fight on!

Following an impressive regular season capped by wins in 15 of its last 16 games, the No. 1 USC men’s volleyball team is poised to make a run in this weekend’s Mountain Pacific Sports Federation tournament.
King of Troy · Senior opposite Murphy Troy, who was named MPSF Player of the Year on Thursday, has played a significant role in USC’s 21-win regular season. The Trojans begin postseason play Saturday against crosstown rival UCLA at Galen Center. - Tim Tran | Daily Trojan 
First in line for the Trojans (21-2, 20-2) is No. 8 UCLA, which USC easily disposed of in straight sets during last week’s MPSF regular season match.
“We’re peaking at the right time,” said USC coach Bill Ferguson. “The guys playing as well as they did last week with nothing on the line shows that we’re in a good place.”
During the regular season, USC won 13 of its 23 matches in straight sets. It has faced — and conquered — a full battery of tests — dropping large leads, making large comebacks and steadily dominating en route to victory. USC’s only losses came in two five-set thrillers.
The Trojans have also been statistically dominant, leading the league in hitting percentage (.355), opponent’s hitting percentage (.249), kills (14.06 per game), assists (13.18 per game) and digs (9.93 per game).
USC won its first MPSF regular season title in 2000. The Trojans have also won their last four matches against UCLA and seven of the last eight.
Senior opposite Murphy Troy has been named MPSF player of the week three times, and junior outside hitter Tony Ciarelli earned the honor twice, as well.
On the other hand, UCLA (16-14, 9-13) has been inconsistent thus far. Although it has beaten the likes of No. 3 UC Irvine, it has also dropped matches to the likes of unranked UC San Diego.
During the last USC-UCLA meeting, Bruins coach Al Scates pulled starting middle blocker Weston Dunlap and starting opposite Kyle Caldwell after an inconsistent match from the two.
“Al’s trying to find a lineup that’ll work,” Ferguson said. “I anticipate that he’ll have a set lineup and give the guys a longer leash.”
Last year, the Trojans dropped the first round match of the MPSF tournament to Cal State Northridge. The Trojans’ experience, skill and all-around cohesion has them primed to avoid a repeat upset this time, however.
“The guys have really bought into the ‘one day, one practice a time’ type of work ethic,” Ferguson said. “There’s no anxiety now. It’s all about us. If we give a good effort and play our game, we’ll be fine.”
First serve is at 7 p.m. at Galen Center on Saturday.

Teresa Sakai, who majored in social sciences and English, is an assistant language teacher for the Japan Exchange and Teaching Programme in Hokkaido, Japan. She graduated from USC last May. The Daily Trojan spoke with Sakai about her work.
 
Daily Trojan: What does your job entail?
Teach · Teresa Sakai majored in social sciences and English at USC. -  Photo courtesy of Teresa Sakai 
Teresa Sakai: My job ranges from visiting elementary schools to implement the English program there to visiting junior high schools and team teaching with a Japanese English teacher to holding my own English class for adults and children. That’s just my experience, but every situation is different depending on what the needs of the town are and how many schools there are in the town.
DT: How did your education at USC help you in your career?
Sakai: As an English major I can present myself with a professional air and I can see where certain mistakes are being made in the language with the students that are practicing.
 
DT: How did you end up teaching in Japan?
Sakai: I was going through the career fair last fall at USC. I knew I wanted to be a teacher, but I wanted to get some experience before going to grad school. I was basically looking for anything teaching-related because I know it’s difficult to get an actual education job without higher education and I saw the booth for the JET program … It seemed like a great opportunity because I love to travel and I really wanted to just try and get some experience.
 
DT: What has been on the biggest adjustment living in Japan?
Sakai: Obviously, it’s a whole different country with different customs, and a whole language I’ve never studied before. In order to apply for the JET program, knowing Japanese is not a requirement … I can communicate a lot easier than I could when I first got here … All the people around me, their English has improved through talking with me and my Japanese has improved through talking with them so mutually we’ve just been helping each other learn a lot.
 
DT: How were you affected by the recent natural disasters?
Sakai: Of course everybody in Japan has been affected. My island is north of everything that’s been going on and my town is on the south coast so we felt the earthquake at a three or four magnitude. Earthquakes happen here all the time so at first it didn’t seem like a huge deal until we saw the news coverage of what was going on. And since my town is coastal we had some damage — the water levels near the harbor rose three meters, which resulted in a lot of flooding. But no one was hurt, which is really great … Also my area does not have the rolling blackouts … I visited Tokyo two weeks ago when my parents came to visit and life is going on as usual. The perseverance of the Japanese people is really amazing.
 
DT: In your experience what are some of the greatest cultural differences between Japan and Southern California?
Sakai: All the students in Japan from junior high to older wear uniforms to school, and I grew up in Southern California so this threw me off at first. Also, the school system is a little different. Instead of the students going form classroom to classroom and the teacher staying put, the students stay in home room, and the teachers move from classroom to classroom. And you find with in the Japanese language you address people based on their seniority. There’s a very high level of respect for people that may be your superiors and you express it.
 
DT: What is one of your greatest college memories?
Sakai: I just love the football atmosphere. That’s been really hard for me to miss out on. I’ve been going to ’SC football games since I was in high school. So fall and autumn to me means football season. Just everyone wearing their school colors and supporting the school no matter what, I really miss the school pride. You can bet I’m always wearing my cardinal and gold on what would be game day and now my students know a little bit about American football.
 
Teresa is a young friend of ours so we enjoyed reading first hand of her experience in Japan and very glad she is safe.

The USC Peace and Conflict Studies Program will host its first-ever conference Saturday, featuring panelists discussing the political conflicts in Northern Ireland as well as Palestine and Israel.
“The Shamrock and the Olive Tree: From Belfast to Bethlehem,” aims to examine the two regions’ conflicts and see what can be learned.
“In Palestine and Israel … the peace process is not working,” said Andrew Manning, professor of International Relations and director of the Peace and Conflict Studies Program, who originally called for the conference. “Then look at Northern Ireland, where the peace process has shown success. Why not look at these two conflicts and see if there are some lessons from Northern Ireland to apply to Palestine [and Israel].”
Manning, who organized the conference and chose the panelists, says the process of planning the conference has not been entirely smooth, particularly considering the controversial nature of the situation in the Middle East.
“Two emails came in, one from UCLA and one from USC, that suggested that the people I’ve asked to be on the panel suggested that I was biased towards the Palestinian cause,” Manning said. “I’m not pro-Palestine, nor pro-Israel. I’m
pro-peace.”
Six panelists will present at the conference, including two USC professors — David Lloyd, professor of English and comparative literature, and Laurie Brand, Robert Grandford Wright Professor and professor of international relations — as well as professors from four other universities in fields ranging from history to philosophy.
“[These are] learned and skilled experts who know a lot about the two regions and they’re also … pretty well-known authorities on the subjects,” said Alia Alanizi, a senior majoring in political science and one of the students helping to organize the event.
Organizers have tried to provide a balance of viewpoints from different political groups in the audience and on the panel.
“It’s been difficult trying to find equal participation from all the different [viewpoints],” said Maria Alegria, who graduated from USC  with a degree in international relations and a minor in peace and conflict studies, and one of the event’s organizers. “We’re trying to get equal representation when it gets to the audience and the panelists and we just wanted all sides.”
Although the panelists will approach the subject from an academic standpoint, students are the primary audience for the conference, according to Mattie Sullivan, a senior majoring in international relations who was involved in planning the event.
“I really want a strong student presence at the conference, and that’s been our main push, to really reach out to students and get them to attend,” Sullivan said.
The organizers hope students who attend will understand the relevance of the situations in Ireland and the Middle East to any conflict resolution.
“The truth is that violence and peace elsewhere has a lot to do with the same subjects here,” Alanizi said. “Certainly anyone in general should be interested in what goes on in the world since it affects the rest of us as well.”
Organizers have also tried to engage the community in the conference.
“We have a long list of community religious and spiritual centers, and different non-profit organizations will be coming too,” Sullivan said. “We’re really excited to have as diverse of a group as possible.”
Manning, who is serving his first year as the director of the Peace and Conflict Studies Program, plans to expand this conference in the future.
The conference will run from
10:30 a.m. to 2 p.m., and will take place in the Rosen Family Screening Theater in the Ronald Tutor Campus Center.

Several organizations staged a protest Thursday to affirm their right to peacefully protest on campus.
The “Day of Peace and Action” was primarily organized by the Social Justice League, a group of students who want to express their right to free speech on campus, but involved representatives from the Student Coalition Against Labor Exploitation, the National Union of Healthcare Workers, the Coalition for a Safer Campus and Community, Call for Justice, Students for Asian Women Empowerment, the “Local 4” chapter of the Brickbuilder’s Union, Take Back the Night, the Nisei Project, the International Socialists Organization and She Shall Go Free.
Speak out · Several organizations marched around campus Thursday afternoon. The groups listened to protesters and songs in front of Tommy Trojan. The protest’s message, however, was not clear to students. - Jaideep Chadha | Daily Trojan 
Approximately 40 people marched around campus holding signs with messages like “I didn’t come to USC to learn to shut my mouth” and “I’m hungry, feed me justice,” while reciting chants such as “we want action, Dr. Jackson” and “an injury to one is an injury to all.”
“We want to create an atmosphere that will hold USC accountable to be a socially just and ethical school,” said Alicia Lu, the event organizer from SJL and a senior majoring in sociology and neuroscience. “Sometimes USC just shoots us down, and they can do that when we are few in number. We want to show our solidarity.”
Onlookers were not clear what the protesters’ intended message was.
Katie Morris, a sophomore majoring cinematic arts – critical studies, said she didn’t understand what the group was marching for.
“I didn’t understand what all their signs were trying to say,” Morris said. “It was interesting that there weren’t just students, but you just saw the protest for a minute and they passed by.”
After marching, the protesters gathered in front of Tommy Trojan.
“We all have our beef at USC and we’re going to make it known,” said Max Hoiland, one of the main event organizers, in front of Tommy. “We have a lot more in common than we have difference, and we want to create a community of support.”
Ashley Wabara, an undeclared freshman, said she came to the rally as a representative for Campus and Community United, which works to ensure the interests of the surrounding community are considered during relevant administrative decisions.
“We’re allies with SJL and wanted to show our support,” Wabara said. “There’s a misconception that students don’t care about these issues or the surrounding area and we have to show that people are actually deeply passionate about them.”
Michael Torres, a respiratory therapist at the USC University Hospital, said he marched to support several university-related unions.
“This is about solidarity,” Torres said. “Unions have to maintain a certain standard of commitment with our brothers and sisters, whether they work as builders, healthcare workers, hospitality or bricklayers. We’re all in negotiations with the university.”
Some students who observed the protest came closer to listen to the speakers, although most people walking along Trousdale did not stop.
Tim McGuingan, a senior majoring in public policy, management and planning, said he was glad to see students exercising their free speech, even though their message was not completely clear.
“At our age, people find causes where they feel like they can make a change,” McGuingan said. “They could have made this protest more cohesive.”
Dear Actually,  You are actually wrong.  USC has excellent policies.  You are simply trying to get us students involved in your labor issues so you can get more attention.  They are not linked.   All that will happen with your raises is that tuition will go up even further.
No, our sexual assault and sexual harassment policies are sh*t. And the way that USC typically handles sexual assault/harassment is despicable. Our standards are disgustingly low, especially compared to other leading universities.
The demonstration was focused on several important but related issues. Many of the groups are focused on the complete lack of worker’s rights at USC, the injustices committed against the surrounding community (gentrification, denying jobs to a population filled with skilled workers, cutting hours and wages, etc.), and related issues. There were also several groups who have been working on addressing issues of sexual harassment, sexual assault, and reforming the USC policies on these issues (as they are terribly inadequate). And there were several groups that want USC to stop relying on corporations that use sweatshop labor to produce our university apparel and labor exploitation to provide food for our dining halls. We delivered a packet to the administration with details about each of the groups and what we are wanting to University to address.
The demonstration was also in response to intimidation tactics by DPS and other university officials against a number of students and groups who are active in the community. It was an opportunity for all of us to come together and support each other.
Also…I wish the author had taken more than 30 seconds to find a link for She Shall Go Free…the site they linked to is under construction. But SSGF has a very active Tumblr page, Blog, Facebook page, and Twitter…
What “thekatman” said.
Protesting for the sake of protesting is a waste of time. Why aren’t you protesting about the lack of quality job development in this country, congressional overspending, illegal immigration that’s out of control, the US involvement in 3 theaters of war, etc?

Many of Los Angeles’s top instrumentalists gathered together Wednesday night for a stunning musical performance led by USC faculty composer and conductor Donald Crockett.
The Faculty Recital took place in Alfred Newman Recital Hall and lasted approximately two hours with intermission.
Crockett is the chair of the music composition department in the Thornton School of Music and director of the Thornton Contemporary Music Ensemble. The recital included three of Crockett’s own compositions.
Crockett’s works included two from the past fourteen years and a more recent one from 2009. His music followed the contemporary classical style, in which melodies are more disjointed and atonal. All of his pieces were equally impressive in their abilities to create powerfully eerie atmospheres.
Although Crockett garnered high enthusiasm as primary composer and solo conductor, the recital also brought much-deserved attention to Crockett’s ensemble, Xtet.
Xtet is composed of several musicians and primarily plays contemporary classical music from the 20th and 21st centuries.
The recital honored Crockett’s 60th birthday as well as Xtet’s 25th year in existence.
“Whistling in the Dark” was the first piece performed, and it instantly set the stage for the rest of the recital. The work has just one movement and was composed by Crockett in 1999.
Through its impressive arrangement, “Whistling in the Dark” shined bright as a captivating opener. The incorporation of various percussive instruments, like maracas, a log drum and a tambourine, helped create a more primitive-sounding folk piece that flaunted an almost mystical allure.
Crockett’s two other works, “Night Scenes” and “Extant,” were similarly spellbinding.
In the first movement of “Extant,” Crockett revealed a more gentle aspect of his personality. For this piece, the harp and bassoon were introduced, which ultimately lent “Extant” a uniquely ethereal feel that Crockett’s previously performed pieces had lacked.
But by the second movement, the piece had quickly transformed itself into a belligerent harmony that was both loud and evocative.
When it comes to Crockett’s style, several people hold different opinions.
“Crockett’s music is often dynamic and exciting, but, for some, I think its disjointedness can discourage people, especially those not well immersed in 20th century classical music,” said Hunter Van Brocklin, a sophomore majoring in music composition.
In addition to Crockett, two of the five pieces performed were composed by USC alumni Jeffrey Holmes and Andrew Norman. Both Holmes and Norman studied under Crockett during their times at Thornton.
Holmes’ “Blue Sail” was a strong contender in Wednesday’s recital. Its contrasting moods and rhythms directly paralleled its titular images of ocean currents, making for a wonderfully sensory experience.
Likewise, Norman’s six-movement piece, “The Companion Guide to Rome,” fit in perfectly with the atonalities found in Crockett’s works.
The highlight of the night was Norman’s sixth movement, Cecilia. The movement was performed entirely by solo violinist Joel Pargman. In an unexpected twist, Pargman stood with his back to the audience throughout his solo performance. The unusual angle allowed the audience to concentrate less on Pargman as a performer and more on the nuanced intricacies of Norman’s charmingly poignant composition.
Although Pargman stuck out as one of the most talented of the night, all of the instrumentalists were spot-on with their performances.
Violinist Sarah Thornblade was the most heavily engaged with her surroundings and played more passionately than anybody else onstage. When tunes turned sorrowful, her face mimicked the woe and misery without fail.
On a similar note, cellist Roger Lebow performed flawlessly in every piece in the concert. His attitude was consistently cheerful and upbeat, and his accuracy did not weaken as the show progressed.
Although the concert was not as well-attended as some of the more popular events on-campus, the audience’s excitement proves that more people, even non-music majors, should make an effort to attend similar events in the future.
“I think non-music majors should at least explore the diversity the Thornton School has to offer. This was a special faculty event featuring guest artists and a real treat for new music buffs like myself,” said Michael Matsuno, a junior majoring in flute performance. “Though it’s fair to say people will gravitate towards one thing or another, I would encourage anyone to go out on a limb and give our ensembles a try.”

This Saturday, the Doctor is in. What doctor? Doctor Who.
For those who don’t know Doctor Who, it’s the longest-running science-fiction show in the world.
It follows the adventures of the Doctor, an alien blessed with multiple regenerations (which allows for different actors to play the role), as he travels through time and space in his time machine, the TARDIS.
Along the way, he fights, meets historical figures and often ends up enthusiastically talking about life and existence.
Since its return in 2005, (it first premiered in 1963 and ended in 1989)the show’s fandom has spread from a niche group to audiences worldwide. People are watching the show, and the show is helping to open viewers’ minds to unconventional and nerdy stories.
Saturday’s premiere, which marks the beginning of the show’s sixth season since its return, will probably be a hit. Matt Smith, the 11th actor to play the Doctor, will return, and current show runner Steven Moffat, a man as gifted at scaring audiences as he is at writing witty dialogue, is writing the episode.
Add in the 1960s setting, on-location filming in the United States (the first time principal photography has shot here), Richard Milhouse Nixon and a scary spacesuit-wearing monster, and you have what should be an entertaining show.
It’s the age of the geek, and Doctor Who’s one of the major players in spreading geek culture.
But what’s strange about Doctor Who is that for a long time it was aimed more at kids than a wider audience.
The show was originally designed to teach kids about history and science, and it was never a headliner or primetime darling. But recently it has spread to the United States, quickly accumulating a strong following that’s growing with each new season.
So how did this show go mainstream so suddenly?
The Doctor is a science hero, not an action hero. There are big explosions, monsters and plenty of chase scenes — Steven Moffat is the king of terrifying adventure stories — but unlike previous mainstream heroes like Rambo or any Schwarzenegger role, the Doctor triumphs through his intellect and a definitely geeky, hyper- enthusiastic love of exploring the universe.
But part of what makes the show so successful — and why it has been able to reach an audience beyond fans of science fiction — is that it’s fun.
No matter how dark the series gets, or how scary the monsters can be, there’s an air of adventure and optimism in every episode.
So many shows today, like Fox’s upcoming Terra Nova, are self-conscious about their geeky elements, like time travel and monsters, and always try to justify those elements, saying the show is more about the story or that those elements don’t matter compared to the political overtones and sexual nature of the content. Maybe they should take a cue from Doctor Who and just embrace their geekiness.
When Russell T. Davies brought Doctor Who back, the show was an oddity. Serious shows like Lost and 24 dominated the airwaves, all trying either to be topical or to reflect the tenseness of contemporary times.
There are no dramatic ethical questions or allusions to terrorism or the like. At a time when mainstream television, however engrossing, was at its most depressing, Doctor Who offered a cathartic adventure each week.
What separates Doctor Who from other shows is it embraces its sci-fi setting and features less melodrama and formulated storyline. By all accounts, the mainstream should have ignored it.
But it didn’t. The Doctor himself has become a geek icon, and now a mainstream icon as well.
Not bad for something that started as an educational show for children.

The indie-rap group Atmosphere, best known for tracks like “You” and “Sunshine,” has returned with The Family Sign, a deep, emotional rap testament that tackles the issues of love, family and domestic abuse.
Photo courtesy of Warner Music Group and Rhymesayers
Atmosphere described The Family Sign on its MySpace Music page as “being okay with losing friends and strengthening your bonds with others, celebrating the person who’s been the most positive in your life, your kids, your homies, leaving the people you need to behind and bringing the ones you love with you.”
The album serves as a coping mechanism, both for Atmosphere and listeners.
Accordingly, The Family Sign shows the progress Atmosphere has made between albums. Its sound has transitioned from something upbeat and fun into something more mellow and mature that tackles bigger issues.
This isn’t to say the band’s older work is any less invigorating. The Family Sign simply shows the band has developed and perfected its craft and related it to its current life experiences and struggles.
Take “The Last to Say,” for example, which delves into issues of domestic abuse.
The analysis of a troubled and unhealthy relationship has light piano and guitar accompaniment with a strong emphasis on lyrics.
The instrumentals give the song and message musical and emotional depth, but the music is soft-spoken enough that the focus remains on the message of the song.
Rapper Slug’s unique voice captures the dilemma of a woman debating her return to a destructive relationship as he sings and since you gotta justify returning, you convinced yourself that he’s just a hurt person.
He also delves into the struggles of a child witnessing physical abuse between parents, proclaiming the anger lives on through their son cuz he saw / he caught it all / a childhood of watchin’ ma and pa get raw.
Slug brings to light an issue rarely discussed in the music world, while also managing to captivate his audience through his rhythmic, beautiful instrumentals and sincerity.    
This sense of honesty and simplicity is maintained in “Just a Show.” Slug plainly states, You don’t really want me to go, it’s just for show.
His acknowledgement of the importance of putting on a facade for the sake of pride in a relationship captivates the listener with its mellow aura and reggae feeling.
“She’s Enough” does the same. It has a catchy beat you can’t help but bob your head to, but it also maintains emotional depth.
The track proposes one girl is more than satisfactory and is all a guy needs.
When it comes to lyrics, the hip-hop-meets-indie group incorporates a clever sense of humor to make light of bigger issues in “Became,” which tells the story of a wolf, presumably a representation of a male sexual predator who chases a desirable girl. Slug raps salivating, want to take you to the stomach / in the cartoon you would’ve turned into a drumstick.  
Atmosphere keeps the album interesting in terms of instrumentals in songs like “My Key” and “Millennium Dodo,” which have psychedelic feelings fitting for an updated version of the ‘60s drug culture and make the album seem like it has a dash of Pink Floyd’s Dark Side of the Moon.
Overall, The Family Sign is an emotional testimony of the day-to-day struggles that mainstream artists gloss over in favor of catchy beats.
Atmosphere manages to entertain while also preserving its musical integrity through complex lyrics paired with interesting and simplified instrumentals.
The piano and guitar give the album an artistic feeling while the slower-tempo raps give the listener time to absorb what is being said.
Atmosphere’s latest will captivate listeners of varying tastes with its well-balanced combination of hip-hop and indie music, and the relatable theme of life’s struggles.

Last week, two members of the Joint Chiefs of Staff released a document that has not received much national attention but has the potential to be crucial in shaping the future of the United States.
Julia Vann | Daily Trojan
Released under the pseudonym “Mr. Y” — an allusion to “Mr. X’s” 1947 article that shaped America’s strategy of containment during the Cold War — the document makes the case for a fundamental change in the way Americans view the world and spend their tax dollars. Titled “A National Strategic Narrative,” the officers’ paper argues for expanding the concept of national security from a purely military one to one that encompasses all of the nation’s capabilities.
With the 2012 election coming up, there is a real opportunity for the authors’ insights to make a major impact on the future of American policy.
Navy Capt. Wayne Porter and Marine Corps Col. Mark Mykleby start with the premise that though military strength is often needed to confront immediate threats, securing the nation in the long term requires maintaining our international credibility and addressing threats before they arise. To do this, they say, we need to redistribute our resources and re-evaluate our perspective, focusing on continued and sustainable security.
Domestically, the authors call for investment in education, healthcare and environmental protection to maintain and nurture our intellectual capital and natural resources.
Internationally, the officers argue for a three-pronged strategy of defense, diplomacy and development, saying the latter two are too often ignored or boxed into separate categories. They propose development now to minimize the need for military action later.
More generally, Porter and Mykleby write Americans need to modernize the lens through which they view the world. Currently, they say, most Americans view interdependence as a weakness, international competition as a zero-sum game, and other groups of people in a highly stereotyped manner. The solution, they write, is to cultivate “innovation, flexibility and resilience.”
“A National Strategic Narrative” is a bold call to action for all Americans. In particular, the fact that two senior military officers would call for massive cuts in defense spending in favor of environmental sustainability, education and diplomacy, enhances credibility and underscores the severity of our poor allocation of resources.
Sadly, it is likely this paper will be talked about but soon forgotten, just like most “grand strategy” papers produced in Washington. This would be a great shame, because rarely is such a sober, practical analysis published by such authoritative voices.
President Barack Obama rode into office promising “change,” and now he finally has a blueprint for it.
As a second term president with the support of top military officials, Obama could have a genuine opportunity to massively redistribute spending, focusing less on defense and more on long-term investments in education, healthcare, environmental sustainability and international diplomacy and development.
This will only happen, however, if the American public begins to understand the challenges “Mr. Y” brings up and to call for solutions.
So as the campaign season begins to heat up, try to look beyond the inevitable name-calling, arguments over a 2-percent change in the top marginal tax rate and Donald Trump’s hair. Instead, pay attention to which candidates seem able and willing to enact fundamental changes in government and get the United States back on a positive long-term track.
If enough voters do, it might actually happen.
 
Daniel Charnoff is a senior majoring in international relations (global business). His column, “Through the Static,” ran Fridays.
When viewing a narrative of this scope (outlining the board our entire foreign policy framework should be “played” upon) we must view the big picture and only drill down into the details where and when they fit this overlying structure. The mixture of principles and interests are what founded our great experiment of a country, and that mixture in large part is what made us grab the imagination of the world. Our other cultural imperatives like exploration (frontiers and space) along with freedom, industriousness, innovation, logistical sophistication and sheer audacity are what held people’s attention and made many want to emulate us.
Bill M you raise so many great discussion points in this thread I wish the forum accepted more html options to quote and respond to sub topics. Thank you for posting so much!
In terms of foreign policy maintaining these goals and strategies strengthen and expand our SOI (sphere of influence) and the stronger that tie to allies and third parties becomes, the stronger our security becomes.
The author seems to believe our prosperity is not sustainable without fixing the structural problems of the third world, but does not make clear why this is the case.
The authors probably though this needed no explanation. No matter our individual political leanings/affiliations, we can all agree that the economic growth of China, the opulence of Dubai and the rising importance of India and southeast Asia all leave us with a feeling of bewilderment. How is this happening? What are the impacts to the USA? Why aren’t WE enjoying this exponential growth from our own domestic initiatives and foreign policy rewards? The goal of foreign policy at its heart is to promote interdependent relationships that transfer tranquility, security and opportunity to our citizenry…isn’t it? Well wouldn’t it stand to reason that setting economic, informational, and industrial capabilities to third world nations (if done smartly)would benefit us two-fold? It would establish strong allies AND provide future competition. Since when have we as a nation been afraid of competition? We all know it raises the skill level and prosperity of all involved.
Using the containment theory set forth by George Kennan was corrupted in its execution from a diplomatic/intelligence strategy into a military one. Even he was vocal about this. It was skewed then, but ultimately effective at great cost, but today its mind-numbingly misguided and hurtful to our interests.
The true message in my opinion of this report, is that we must focus internally. No our streets never ran with gold as so many immigrants of the past wished. But with this framework in place, we can sure polish up this rusty behemoth we call home. We are the (relatively) modern day birthplace of innovation, of technology, of entrepreneurial spirit. Lets remember that.
Is it right that our politicians, bankers and speculators were allowed to cause an unprecedented global recession? Is it right to try to increase our debt ceiling? Is it right that our CEO’s can earn 30 times the wages of their employees that have had stagnant wage growth for 30 years while the hopeless earn federal assistance in record amounts? Is it right that our transportation, water and energy infrastructures are degraded and incapable of continuous improvement without total overhaul? Is it right that 15-20 years of industry policy has forced our manufacturing base out of country, exposing us to huge security risk? Why are our national graduate programs a majority of foreign students?
Lets retake our position as having the finest scientists, political theories and implemented technological systems.
Applying this narrative to our trade treaties, educational initiatives, infrastructure upgrades and intelligence staffing and decision making will benefit us for decades to come. And if not, it certainly wont hurt as much as using the globe as a checker board of independent reactionary policies to any flare-up this dynamic globe throws in our face.
Communistic Globalist crud….what a joke. Lets be nice to the rest of the world, and they will put American well being first and foremost…LOL!!!
Heard about the article just now on CNN GPS and it’s gratifying to see our best and brightest are in the CJCS office!  Very closely aligned with another article recently about the need to shrink the remnants of our empire and focus on competitiveness. Thank for bringing it to the fore and into the minds of our future leaders.
Cogent writing, Danny. Truly appreciate your bringing this compelling document to my attention. 
See ya at The Spot.
Great article – well-written and incredibly informative. Thank you!
There is truly nothing new under the sun. This “Narrative” is nothing more than a rehashing of tired leftist rhetoric. Might seem new to you kids. But it’s not.
As a graduate of the University of Southern California, I am gratified to see this note in the Daily Trojan!  Thanks, and keep getting the word out!

Last week, Orange County Republican Central Committee member Marilyn Davenport distributed an email that transposed President Barack Obama’s face onto a small chimpanzee’s head, as part of a chimpanzee family portrait.
Beneath the amateurish Photoshop job was a caption that read, “Now you know why no birth certificate!”
It gets better. Not only did Davenport, a Tea Party activist, try to laugh the whole thing off, she then played the religion card to try to diffuse tensions once she realized the incident wasn’t going away,
Just before the GOP committee met for its monthly summit at a hotel in Irvine, Davenport released a statement  to her colleagues, apologizing for the email and assuring America she is merely “an imperfect Christian lady who tries her best to live a Christ-like honoring life.”
Setting aside Davenport’s racism, bigotry and shameless attempt to cover vile ignorance with a wafer-thin veneer of religion, Davenport should be fired because she can’t be left unsupervised at a computer.
But Birtherism extends far beyond lackeys like Davenport.
The man who has shaped the modern-day Manhattan skyline, Donald Trump, is a Birther.  He is so convinced he has dispatched private investigators to Hawaii to dig up the “inevitable” dirt on Obama.
Birthers seem to think Obama somehow fooled everyone, into thinking he is a mysterious shape-shifter who no one had ever seen until he turned 30. They’ll be disappointed when they go to Hawaii and, as The Atlantic documented  just last week, find Barack Obama’s birth announcement on microfilm in the Honolulu Star-Advertiser, to the left of ads for Acme Termite Service and a general contractor named Ernie.
If that’s not good enough, they can seek out the Live Birth Certificate released by the Obama Administration  and stored by the Hawaii Department of Health. Several legitimate, governmentally approved articles of proof exist to show Barack Obama was born in the United States.  Game over.
But, Birthers.org insists Obama is withholding his “vault copy,” which will prove he is not a United States citizen.
Given Birther supporters include the likes of Michelle Bachmann, who thinks the Founding Fathers fought slavery, at what point do you reconsider your beliefs? Even Karl Rove has denounced Birtherism as both ridiculous and a potential roadblock to Republicans contributing to U.S. politics in a meaningful way.
When underhanded political smear-tactics like Birtherism fail both the test of empirical fact and the Karl Rove sniff test, it’s time to pack it in.
 
Teddy Minch is master of public policy student concentrating in civil infrastructure finance.
Birthers make it seem like the 2008 Presidential Election was the first time some type of foul play may have been committed in the election of a US President. Does anyone remember 11 year ago when Bush received LESS votes than Gore and still won the presidency? That doesn’t seem too constitutional now does it?
Honestly though, I am glad the GOP and the Tea Party is still pushing this issue. The more they push it, the more idiotic they look in the public’s eyes…
First logical fail in this argument: Do we know that this woman actually questions Obama’s birth certificate? Because her tasteless and arguably offensive joke is just that – a joke. But sure, you can use that a jumping off point to bash lots of Republican types. 
Speaking of political smear-tactics… and snotty rhetoric: Apparently a degree in civil infrastructure finance doesn’t confer the ability to research history oneself. Bachmann’s comments were not off base, as was discussed at length at the time. However, if your news all comes from Mr. Tingly-Leg Chris Matthews, you might not be aware of this. 
Mr. Minch, since you have set yourself up as an arbiter of “vile ignorance,” I wonder if you have a comment on the leftist website Wonkette bashing a 3-year-old special-needs child as “retarded” and mocking him as a “gentleman scholar.” Of course, the lefties claimed this was legit because the child’s mom apparently “uses him as a political prop.” The mom is Sarah Palin, and apparently she is not allowed to hold the child in public for fear of being labeled a prop-user. But anyway… do you not find this to be quite a bit more offensive than a tasteless photoshopped joke involving a grown man? I mean, on your finely-tuned indignation scale (“racism, bigotry, shameless attempt to cover vile ignorance”) – and speaking of people who REALLY can’t be left unsupervised at a computer?

Longtime USC men’s basketball assistant coach Bob Cantu will remain at USC for the 2011-2012 season, according to multiple reports.
Cantu had previously interviewed for the head coaching position at both Fresno State and UC Davis, but is no longer a candidate for either position. He will remain the associate head coach under Kevin O’Neill.
“I am not a candidate for any head coaching positions,” Cantu told Pedro Moura of ESPNLosAngeles.com on Thursday. “I’m focused on recruiting and next season.” 
Cantu is entering his 11th season with the Trojans, previously working under four different coaches — Henry Bibby, Jim Saia, Tim Floyd and O’Neill
O’Neil told fans that he expected Cantu, who coached USC in its Pac-10 tournament semifinal matchup against Arizona,  to land a head coaching job soon.

Tim Hetherington, the co-director of the Academy Award-nominated documentary Restrepo, was killed in an attack in Libya Wednesday morning.
The attack was caused by a grenade, which also killed and injured several other journalists and photographers. The 41-year-old filmmaker was scheduled to be honored in Los Angeles by the Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America, with co-director Sebastian Junger, for his work on Restrepo. Hetherington is being remembered as a brave and dedicated  artist, who lived a life full of courage and purpose.
Hetherington’s family said in a statement, “It is with great sadness we learned that our son and brother photographer and filmmaker Tim Hetherington was killed today in Misrata, Libya by a rocket-propelled grenade. Tim will be remembered for his amazing images and his Academy Award nominated documentary Restrepo which he co-produced with his friend Sebastian Junger. Tim was in Libya to continue his ongoing multimedia project to highlight humanitarian issues during time of war and conflict. He will be forever missed.”

When you first hear the word “peapod,” you might think of vegetables or maybe those infant costumes that stores sell around Halloween. The Peapod Foundation, the Black Eyed Peas’ organization, definitely has nothing to do with either one of those things.
The Peapod Foundation began as a charity that held toy drives for Los Angeles based children and local orphanages. Since then, BEP has put on several benefit concerts supporting social issues concerning children.
BEP has announced that the Peapod Foundation will be opening a music and video production school in New York, specifically downtown Manhattan. The school will give teenagers the chance to attend classes that will allow them to work with top-notch equipment.
With the help of Peapod’s partner, the Adobe Foundation, BEP has already been able to establish its Peapod Adobe Youth Voices music and multimedia academies in Los Angeles, Oakland and Redwood City.
The programs available not only teach students about music production and how to edit videos, but also how to express themselves through poetry and dance.
Classes in New York will begin this July in a building that is run by an after-school program named Urban Arts Partnership.
