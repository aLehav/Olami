President Barack Obama announced his new Call to Arts Initiative on Friday to help garner mentorship of young people through the arts. As a part of the initiative, the film industry — through American Film Institute and Screen Actors Guild-American Federation of Television and Radio Artists — has pledged to give one million mentor hours over the next three years together to inspire and engage young people nationwide
“If we give all of our kids the best opportunities and technologies and resources, there’s no telling what they’ll create, now and in the years ahead,” Obama said on Friday at the second-annual White House Student Film Festival. “We’ve seen how impactful these mentoring services can be.”
At the White House Film Festival themed “The Impact of Giving Back,” Obama was joined by celebrities Hilary Swank, Steve McQueen, Jake Johnson, Terrence J, LaLa Anthony, Kal Penn, Amber Riley, Michael Ealy and Will Packer, who all pledged to help young people grow as artists by sharing their own passions.
The Call to Arts joint initiative is a part of the president’s progress in his larger My Brother’s Keeper program, which he began a year ago to work toward close the opportunity gap faced by young men of color. The effort is being spearheaded by the Corporation for National and Community Service, the federal agency assigned to the president’s nationwide service initiative.
“Programs like My Brother’s Keeper were launched by the president to recognize our responsibility to reach every young person regardless of who they are or where they come from,” said in a statement from the White House.
CNCS, in collaboration with organizations like MENTOR: The National Mentoring Project, will match partner organizations to SAG-AFTRA members in order to share their skills and experience with students.
USC’s Pullias Center for Higher Education, within the Rossier School of Education, launched its own mentoring program called Increasing Access Mentoring Program. The action-based program includes intensive mentoring from USC faculty and graduate students to aid college-ready high school seniors through the college application process. Through the mentoring, the program provides local high school seniors with critical information and support that they otherwise may not have had access to.
The I AM Mentoring Program focuses on increasing college-going for Cal State and UC eligible high school seniors in schools with historically low college matriculation rates. Through mentorship relationships, students receive insight on transitioning from high school to college.
At the White House event, Steve McQueen, director of 12 Years A Slave shared his experiences in the arts community and challenged others in the film industry to work with youth.
“To look at film, but also at the same time, to ask questions. It’s just one of those things, to be aware of what we want to do as artists and influencers in our own community and the broader, bigger world,” said McQueen.
“Growing up, I was treated like an outsider because my family was poor, so I escaped into books and film … they made me want to become an actor so I could continue learning about myself,” said Swank, who named her mother and teachers as mentors. “The most important person when it comes to defining and achieving success is you.”
In studies by MENTOR it has been shown that students who meet regularly with mentors are half as likely to skip school and 37 percent less likely to skip a class. In addition, students who meet with their mentors are 46 percent less likely to begin using illegal drugs and 27 percent less likely to consume alcohol.
Through My Brother’s Keeper, the president has coordinated with other government entities, businesses, nonprofits, and education agencies to match young people with tools and opportunities for success, regardless of circumstances. The program is broken down into three tiers: Place-Based State and Local Engagement, Private-Sector Action and Public Policy review and reform. In the program’s first year, more than 2,000 individual community-based allies have committed to support the My Brother’s Keeper initiatives within their local communities.

Over spring break, students from the Marshall School of Business traveled to different countries across the globe through the Global Leadership Program and Learning about International Commerce program.
Both programs are only open to first-year students and aim to guide them in understanding different types of business strategies in international commerce. LINC is a seven-week course that teaches students about international business concepts.
There are aspects such as the economy, the culture and the political situation, that are all taken into account in class before the students go to one of the 13 locations that are provided.
“Students are given that information and then, slowly it builds a foundation so that when they are there, meeting with the different companies, they have a background,” said LINC coordinator Sean O’Connell.
During the seven-week program, while the students are still on campus, classes revolve around concepts regarding cultural awareness and the economic state of the country. Students are engaged in conversations with professors who have taught in the program multiple times.
Jason Hill, a freshman majoring in business administration with an emphasis in cinematic arts, explained that he related to his professors when he traveled to Santiago, Chile. According to O’Connell, the LINC program has not changed in the past 10 years, but the companies and the focus of the programs have.
Stephanie Chang, a freshman majoring in business administration, traveled to New Delhi, India over spring break and said that her time in class helped her throughout new experiences in New Delhi.
“A lot of the time that we spent in class before the trip, it was about being culturally aware and understanding that the businesses we were going to be visiting weren’t traditional Western businesses,” Chang said.
Though they did not meet with other business students in the area, there were interactive events that the USC students enjoyed.
Chang especially enjoyed the meeting with representatives from Indigo Airlines because they treated the USC students as college students who were interested in learning more about business.
“Seeing how not all successful companies are American is a huge takeaway for me,” Chang said.
Bella Meschini, a freshman majoring in business administration, also traveled to India and enjoyed the activities that USC planned, as well as the cultural sights, such as the Taj Mahal. There was also a company visit, which combined both.
“One of the company visits that we made was to a dance company,” Mischini said. “Their mission is to keep the Indian culture alive through traditional dance, so that was really interesting too.”
During their time in the different countries, students lived in hotels in safe areas and were given the opportunity to experience new cultures.
“It kind of helps me with looking at the bigger picture,” Hill said. “The market is bigger than just the LA market or the American market … friends and I toured a lot of the city; we climbed a hill; we visited a zoo, toured the town [and] we tried a lot of new restaurants…”
The LINC program also offers first year students the opportunity to visit countries, such as Japan and Australia, in May.

USC’s Alternative Spring Break program hosted students, staff and faculty from March 14 to March 21 to complete domestic and international service learning trips organized by university academic departments and student organizations.
The Alternative Spring Break program is an opportunity for students, staff and faculty to engage in service learning in communities outside the Los Angeles area.
Navajo Nation, the longest-running ASB trip, provides students the opportunity to engage with community service and Navajo culture. Students tutor children at an elementary school, hike the Mesa Verde National Park in Mesa Verde, Colorado, and volunteer with local nonprofits, among other things.
Drew Lane, a sophomore majoring in international relations, spoke about his rewarding experience on the Navajo Nation trip.
“One day we went on a hike and sat with the high school students from the reservation and talked about their lives and their plans for the future,” Lane said. “A lot of them were so motivated, it was really amazing.”
Another trip in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, focused on youth and education. Students specifically had the opportunity to become acquainted with Teach for America, talk to a public official about education in Louisiana and partner with elementary school students in a mentorship program.
Pablo Pozas Guerra, a sophomore majoring in industrial and systems engineering, said that there is still a tangible gap between kids who are interested in attending college and others who still dream of professional athletic careers.
“So many of the kids I worked with showed an interest in going to college,” Pozas said. “I know when I was in sixth grade I did not show a similar interest. But you could see the other side of it, too. Some kids still had the dream of being NFL or NBA players. That disparity was really eye-opening.”
Lane also found that he learned from his experiences with teenagers in the Navajo Nation.
“I really learned to get to know people on a deeper level,” Lane said. “That can be so valuable in life.”
Pozas said he felt rewarded by the connection he made with both the USC students on the trip and the students he worked with in Baton Rouge.
“I really enjoyed being matched up with my buddies,” Pozas said. “They offered a lot of insight into their culture and situation. I understood their lives more than I thought I would. Hopefully I was a role model for them.”
Alternative Spring Break trips generally cost between $450 and $3,100 per person. The application period for alternative winter and spring break programs in the 2015-2016 school year will take place at the beginning of next fall semester.
In addition to their domestic trips, ASB offers international destinations in Guatemala, India, Mexico and Thailand. Other domestic trips also include Charlotte, North Carolina; San Francisco and San Jose, California; Orcas Island, Washington, and Baltimore, Maryland.
“I remember the morning we left, I was second-guessing my choice of going on an alternative spring break,” Pozas said. “I was really missing home and thought this might not have been the best choice for me at the time. In retrospect, this is the best thing I could have done with my spring break. To anyone who is thinking about doing an alternative spring break, do it.”

The university has officially come to an agreement with USC Hospitality and Auxiliary Services workers to raise wages, provide more hours and supply affordable health care.
The agreement was officially enacted on March 13 after it was voted on and ratified by union members. Among those who voted, 92 percent were in favor of the terms within the new agreement.
Immediately after signing the ratification workers received a $400 bonus and a 75-cent raise, up from their current hourly wage of $11. Workers were also granted a 55-cent raise every July. The union was originally advocating for a wage of $15 per hour, and at one point rebuffed a 25-cent raise  offer by the university.
The new contract includes healthcare coverage, which allows all hospitality workers as well as their spouses and dependents access to healthcare professionals for $50 a month. The previous contract had expired on June 30, 2014.
With the advent of this new agreement, employees plan to maximize hours they are scheduled to work. The new contract stresses the importance that all shifts assigned to workers must be completed by the workers themselves and not by managers who send employees home early.
The new agreement was created in response to long-term protests and rallies held by UNITE HERE Local 11 labor union workers with support from the on-campus Student Coalition Against Labor Exploitation.
Ofelia Carrillo, communications representative for UNITE HERE Local 11, said she was happy about the specific changes made to the contract.
“The contract in essence lines out and regulates workplace conditions, wages, health benefits and job descriptions,” Carrillo said. “It’s incredible. It’s amazing. I think a lot of the wages and the conditions at USC were something we had to organize and had to really fight.”
According to Carrillo, the students that teamed up with workers were a big help in pushing for a new contract.
“The students were extremely important in getting this together,” Carrillo said. “Some of our worker leaders have said and some of our student leaders have said that this really changes the dynamic on campus. This demonstrated that students care about workers and workers care about students and that when they’re united they can make real change happen.”
Genesis Diaz, a UNITE HERE leader and Trojan Grounds cashier, explained that the contract shows the students support USC workers.
“I feel great about the new contract,” Diaz said in a statement from a press release by the UNITE HERE administration. “It has changed the whole campus. It showed the university that we’re united; the workers and students are a family.”
Sarah Newell, a member of SCALE, said students contributed to union efforts after being told about the workers’ unfair labor conditions.
“We talked with students about the average wage of USC workers [which] is about $18,000 dollars a year, [that] they are living below the poverty line [and that] we have workers that are working homeless,” Newell said. “Once students found out, the mobilization really happened on its own. The campus cares about their workers and that’s what they let USC know.”
Newell explained that workers faced numerous difficulties while advocating for a pay increase.
“USC didn’t make this offer first,” Newell said. “[USC] didn’t want to offer pay increases. They came into it pretty clearly with the goal of not costing the university any additional money even if that resulted in the suffering of their workers. It was only through repeated organizing, advocating on the outside that workers were able to let USC know, ‘Hey, if you don’t treat us better we aren’t going to stand for it.’”
The university did not immediately respond to requests for comments regarding the contract agreement.
Paco Torres, a kitchen worker from Cafe 84, said he did not anticipate as much backlash from USC during negotiations.
“I honestly never thought it was going to be like this,” Torres said. “I never thought it was going to be like really a battle. I thought ‘O.K. this is USC, hopefully this won’t be this much of a battle,’ but it was. It was a battle and hard struggle, but we accomplished something. I feel like we did something pretty good.”

The No. 4 USC men’s tennis team earned third place at the BNP Paribas Collegiate Challenge presented by Oracle at Indian Wells, California, and routed crosstown rival No. 14 UCLA at Marks Stadium.
After defeating the Bruins 4-1 on March 14, the Trojans opened the Collegiate Challenge on March 20 with a redeeming 4-0 sweep of No. 20 Tulsa — the Golden Hurricane handed the then-No. 1 Trojans a 4-3 upset loss earlier in the season — but dropped a 4-3 nailbiter to the No. 3 Baylor Bears in the semifinal round the next day. USC claimed third in the Collegiate Challenge after a 4-0 victory over No. 29 Columbia on March 22 in the third-place game.
Saturday’s matchup between the Trojans and the Bears went the distance, coming down to the final game. In doubles, senior Trojan duo Yannick Hanfmann and Roberto Quiroz took down the Bears’ Tony Lupieri and Mate Zsiga 6-4, while sophomore Nick Crystal and freshman Thibault Forget fell 6-3 to the Baylor pair of Felipe Rios and Vince Schneider. The Bears narrowly came away with the doubles point, as Baylor’s Diego Galeano and Julian Lenz eked out a win over junior Max de Vroome and senior Eric Johnson 7-6 in the third game of doubles play.
“We had a match point at one point in doubles,” head coach Peter Smith said. “With the scoring system how it is, your window of opportunity is usually small but it’s there. We didn’t get it [Saturday], but I think that’ll really drive us the next time we play [Baylor]. Of course we want to win it, but I think what’s more important is just competing in that situation, because you’re better for it.”
Initially down 1-0, following Crystal’s loss to Baylor’s Rios, the Trojans clawed back on terms 3-3 with the Bears in singles. USC’s No. 20 Quiroz fought his way to a two set win over No. 39 Lupieri on court two, fellow senior Johnson followed suit with a win over Max Tchoutakian on court three. Senior Jonny Wang brought the Trojans ahead 3-2 with his win over Baylor’s Schneider. In the final match of the tug-of-war between the two sides, however, the Trojans’ Hanfmann (ranked No. 8 nationally) couldn’t hang on against the Bears’ Lenz (ranked No. 4 nationally) who handed the Bears a 4-3 victory with his 6-2, 7-5 win.
In Sunday’s contest against Columbia, the Trojans never lost the lead. Doubles competition witnessed the USC tandems of Johnson-de Vroome and Hanfmann-Quiroz win their games 6-4 and 7-5, respectively, to put the Trojans ahead 1-0.
“We went out [Sunday] and took care of business,” Smith said. “We played with a good sense of urgency. We knew it was kind of a strap match for us, and we walked out there ready to go.”
In singles, the defending NCAA champion Trojans wasted no time in closing out the match. Johnson posted a near-immaculate showing with a 6-0, 6-1 win at the start of singles play to make the USC advantage 2-0. Hanfmann soon followed suit, claiming a 6-2, 6-1 victory and pushing the lead to 3-0. De Vroome delivered the knockout blow, winning 7-6, 6-4 to complete the 4-0 sweep and clinch third place in the tournament for the Trojans. With the majority of the seven points already in the bag for the Trojans, Crystal, Quiroz and Wang’s matches were abandoned from play.
Following the third-place finish, the Trojans are 15-3 overall. With the Pac-12 Championships a month away, the Trojans will host Washington and Oregon this upcoming weekend.
“We’re excited to be home,” Smith said. “I wouldn’t say we’re that familiar with our upcoming opponents, but we’re excited to be home and taking care of our training and our course.”

The No. 7 USC women’s tennis team battled through a tough weekend schedule that featured two top-10 Pac-12 rivals, Cal and Stanford. The Women of Troy came through untouched, however, managing to maintain their perfect conference record of 3-0. USC is 14-2 overall on the season.
“Taking down Cal and Stanford on consecutive days gives us a ton of confidence moving forward,” said associate head coach West Nott following the weekend’s matches. “You want to be playing your best tennis down the stretch and we are doing well there.”
USC seems to have the Golden Bears’ number, upsetting Cal, 4-3, for the second time already this season, with the first win coming with the same score in a nonconference match in Berkeley on Feb. 20.
USC was locked in a dead heat early on in the match, but finally prevailed to win the doubles point with an 8-6 win by the team of sophomore Zoë Katz and senior Sabrina Santamaria.
The determining match of the day was left to freshman Meredith Xepoleas, who was later named Pac-12 Player of the Week. After winning the first set 7-6(6), Xepoleas dropped the second set, 2-6. As the third set heated up, Xepoleas was greeted with resounding support from the Marks Stadium crowd. Finding her groove, Xepoleas took care of business with a convincing 6-3 victory that sealed the overall victory for the Women of Troy.
The following day USC dismantled No. 10 Stanford at home with a 6-1 victory over the Cardinal.
To win the doubles point, the Women of Troy fired off two straight wins, suspending the third match.
On the singles side of the action, a powerful freshman trio served up some major power for the Women of Troy, leading the way to the overall victory. Freshman Gabby Smith won eight straight games in her 6-0, 6-2 upset. Xepoleas cruised to a victory with the score of 6-0, 6-1, dropping only a single game. The final freshman for USC, Madison Westby, cranked out a 6-4, 6-2 win for the Women of Troy.
The rest of the match was not without drama as Santamaria pulled off a remarkable comeback playing from the No. 1 spot. Playing against nationally ranked No. 3 Carol Zhao, Santamaria lost the first set, 4-6. Digging herself a hole in the second set, Santamaria was down 1-5 before rallying to win the set 7-5. After forcing the tie breaker, Santamaria won 11-9.
USC’s No. 18 Guiliana Olmos then sealed the deal for the Women of Troy with her 7-5, 6-4 win.
“As far as being undefeated, we don’t really think about that, we just try to go 1-0 each match and control the things we can control,” Nott said in regard to the team’s expectations moving forward. “I think if you start thinking about results, that’s when you can get yourself into trouble and become complacent.”
USC is now riding a four-game winning streak and are 3-0 in conference play, having opened conference play with a 6-1 victory against Washington State in Pullman on March 15. The Women of Troy will continue prepping for their                   Pac-12 push as they hit the road next weekend. First, USC will play in Eugene against Oregon on Friday before continuing up north to face Washington in Seattle on Saturday.
“They truly are hungry and obsessed about the game, makes it a really fun experience,” Nott said.

In addition to the fact that it was spring break and I had finally found some leisure time after a stressful two weeks of midterms, as a sports fan, this past weekend was one of my favorites of 2015 so far. March Madness began on Tuesday and did not disappoint.
As a Trojan, I’m proud of the Pac-12 going undefeated in the first round and three  Pac-12 teams reaching the Sweet 16, even if one of those teams is UCLA. Despite some amazing upsets, my bracket is still in really good shape, so I can’t complain.
One upset was so touching that I can’t even be disappointed that I had Baylor in my Sweet 16. I don’t think I’m alone when I say that coach Ron Hunter and the Georgia State Panthers captured my heart and became my favorite underdog. After the first round upset over Baylor, I was hoping Georgia State would win the whole tournament. Unfortunately, their run was cut short by Xavier in the Round of 32, but I think the Panthers will be my favorite part of the 2015 tournament.
Hunter caught America’s attention when he tore his Achilles tendon while celebrating his team’s win over Georgia Southern in the Sun Belt Conference championship game to earn a spot in the NCAA tournament. That 38-36 win was decided by free throws made by Hunter’s son, guard R.J., with 21.6 seconds left in the game.
As if anyone needed another reason to root for the Panthers, Kevin Ware, a former Louisville Cardinal who snapped his leg in the Final Four game, en route to Louisville’s 2013 championship win, scored a team-high 18 points in Georgia State’s win over Georgia Southern and earned his return to the tournament.
Their conference win was enough to earn them an automatic tournament bid, but it stacked the odds against them as they were a 14-seed scheduled to open the tournament against third-seeded Baylor. The moment I fell in love with the Hunters and Georgia State was R.J.’s 3-point buzzer beater that lifted Georgia State over Baylor and sent his dad to the floor. Ron’s famous fall and the emotional celebration with his son had me in tears, and the interviews that came in the following day were just as touching and funny.
Following their loss to Xavier, the Hunters again caused the waterworks as Ron celebrated his team as the head coach of Georgia State and celebrated his son as a proud father. What makes this story even better is that it isn’t a fluke and it didn’t happen by a stroke of luck. R.J. is NBA material who was able to use his March Madness fame to capitalize on his potential and increase his draft stock.
According to nbadraft.net, Hunter is the 33rd overall prospect and is ranked at 27 by Draft Express. This isn’t anything new, however, as Kevin Durant tweeted his praise of Hunter last June after Hunter’s excellent performance at LeBron James’ Skills Academy, an exclusive camp held for the top college and high school players.
Hunter almost left after his sophomore season, frustrated with his struggling squad. He came back to play for his dad another year and it was certainly a season to remember. R.J. has a difficult decision ahead: to return for his senior season or to declare for the NBA draft.
When asked whether his son was coming back, Ron said he’d love to coach him another year, but they’d ultimately have to think it over. It would make a lot of sense for Hunter to declare for the draft, as his exposure will likely never be this high again, especially at a lesser-known school like Georgia State.
Whatever they decide, I hope we see a lot more of the Hunters. I hope Ron and the Panthers become familiar faces in the tournament, and I hope that R.J. has a long and successful NBA career.

No. 8 USC demonstrated its ability to dominate on the road this past weekend, taking the first away series of the season 2-1 against the Cal Poly Mustangs.
The 19-5 Trojans have quickly climbed up the rankings into the top 10 during the first half of the season thanks to the team’s explosive offensive play and impressive starts from the pitching staff.
In the first game of the series against the Mustangs Friday night, the Trojans suffered a disappointing 5-4 loss because of a costly fielding error with two outs in the bottom of the sixth inning which led to four unearned runs. The Trojans led the Mustangs, 1-0, through the first five innings and, with two runs scored in the top of the seventh thanks to a triple by junior Timmy Robinson, came within one run of Cal Poly.
USC was unable to come away with another run, however, as Cal Poly reliever Danny Zandona came in during the final two innings, retiring the side twice and striking out four.
“I don’t think we’ve played great defense so far and we need to get better at that,” head coach Dan Hubbs said. “We need to do a much better job of getting ourselves out of a jam on the mound. If the starter goes six, when the reliever comes in, we’re doing a poor job of getting ourselves out of a jam when there’s a man on second and third with one out.”
Wasting no time sulking on the tough loss, the Trojans came charging back on Saturday with a 13-0 shutout over Cal Poly, tallying 13 runs on 15 hits, the second highest number of hits they have had in a game this season.
Hubbs attributes his team’s offensive success on the ability to advance runners and come up with key hits in big spots.
“I think we’ve done a good job at finding our pitch and not trying to do too much with it,” Hubbs said. “We’ve done a real good job of trying to stay in the middle of the field and stay over the ball, hard ground balls and low line drives as opposed to high fly balls. The kids have bought into it and it worked really well for us.”
The Trojans were led on the mound by junior Kyle Twomey, who had a strong six-inning, two-hit start. Offensively, the Trojans took a 2-0 lead in the fourth inning and never looked back, adding four runs in the sixth and seven in the eighth to bring their lead to 13-0.
Six different Trojans had       multihit outings, led by redshirt junior Bobby Stahel with three hits and junior David Oppenheim with four runs on two hits.
Hubbs feels his team responded well to Friday’s loss with big numbers on Saturday.
“After [Friday’s] game, we just talked about getting back to what we do: play good defense, try to stay low and hard with our contact and throw strikes,” Hubbs said. “I think we did a really good job of that. I was really impressed at the way our team battled back after losing a tough one in a game we felt we could’ve and should’ve won, but we really bounced back and put it to them the next two days.”
On Sunday, the Trojans again handled the Mustangs easily with a 9-2 win. The team got off to an explosive start, scoring four runs in the first, three in the second and two in the fifth.
The Trojans scored nine runs on 12 hits as freshman starter Mitch Hart got it done on the mound, pitching seven solid innings of four-hit, one-run baseball to earn his fifth win of the season. The Trojans played solid small ball throughout the game, with a series of key doubles and singles by Stahel, senior Garrett Stubbs, Robinson, Oppenheim and redshirt sophomore Reggie Southall.
Throughout the weekend, USC capitalized on Cal Poly’s many mistakes, resulting in many of the Trojans runs. In the three games, the Mustangs gave up two errors, three errors and three errors, respectively. Also, Cal Poly faced a lot of problems within their pitching staff, needing to pull starters as early as the first inning.
“We were patient and able to get our pitch,” Hubbs said. “On a couple of our errors, it directly led to runs. In case and point on Sunday we were up 5-1 and they made a flip to first base which flew over the first baseman’s head and we were able to score two runs which would’ve been the end of the inning. The pitchers gave us a lot of pitches we could hit.”
USC’s hot streak on offensive has lead to an increase in confidence and flexibility for the pitching staff, who has struggled at time in terms of relief pitching.
“Our staff knows if they make a mistake we can always come back from it,” Hubbs said. “I think mentally it’s huge for pitchers to be able to attack the strike zone and know that if they do give up a run or two that we still have a chance to come back. In the game we lost, when we put up a crooked number in multiple innings, it’s hard to come back from that. I think the pitchers feel really good that our guys can come back on offense if we give up a run or two.”
Looking at the week ahead, the Trojans will host Pepperdine tonight and travel to Seattle to face Washington this weekend.
Hubbs believes that the Trojans can maintain their impressive start to the season if they concentrate on making the appropriate improvements.
“We need to play better defense, continuing to work on our short game and find that guy out of the bullpen who’s going to be able to get us out of jams,” Hubbs said. “If we can do those three things, we’re going to be really hard to beat.”

The women’s swimming and diving team finished in eighth place at the NCAA Swimming and Diving Championships in Greensboro, North Carolina, on March 21.
The Trojans finished with 163 points. Cal won the team title with 513 points, followed by Georgia (452), Stanford (363), Texas A&M (231), Virginia (229), Louisville (197), Texas (164), USC, Florida (129) and Indiana (126).
USC is one of just four schools to finish in the top eight every year for the past six years, along with Georgia, California and Stanford.
Senior Haley Ishimatsu took second place on the platform to end her collegiate career. Ishimatsu was the reigning platform champion for two years before placing second behind Indiana’s Jessica Parratto (367.00) with a score of 339.65.
“Haley Ishimatsu finished a close second today, diving very well. Her positive attitude, joyful demeanor and diving grace left us a lasting memory,” said head diving coach Hongping Li.
On Thursday, the first day of the meet, USC’s 400y medley relay of freshman Hannah Weiss, senior Andrea Kropp and juniors Kendyl Stewart and Kasia Wilk finished seventh in the  ‘A’ final in a season-best 3:31.00. The group gave USC its seventh 400y medley relay ‘A’ final appearance in the past eight seasons.
The Trojans 200y free relay of Wilk, sophomore Evan Swenson, sophomore Chelsea Chenault and Stewart finished second in the ‘B’ final in 1:28.15, just 0.28 off the school record.
Stewart (100y fly) and Chenault (200y free) led the Trojans on the second day of competition by both posted record-setting career bests while also leading USC to an All-American 800y free relay.
Stewart placed third in her first career ‘A’ final in the event. She also lowered her school record for the third straight swim with a 50.92. Her 51.03 in prelims broke her Pac-12 title winning time of 51.10 three weeks ago. That swim lowered her 51.32 set in her 2013 Pac-12 title swim.
Chenault broke USC’s school record in the 200y free in prelims with a 1:42.53, lowering Katinka Hosszu’s 1:43.15 from 2012. In her first career NCAA ‘A’ final, she took sixth in 1:43.90.
USC’s 800y free relay closed the second day by earning All-American honors for the sixth year in a row in the timed final as Wilk, Stewart, junior Joanna Stenkvist and Chenault finished fifth in a season-best 7:01.03, 2.09 off the school record. Chenault’s 1:43.62 anchor split was second only to Cal’s Olympian Missy Franklin in the final.
To wrap up the night, Weiss won the ‘B’ final of the 100y back posting a personal best of 51.60, which lowered Presley Bard’s 2011 school record by two-hundredths of a second.
“The team record performances turned in by Chelsea Chenault, Hannah Weiss and Kendyl Stewart today were indicative of this team’s commitment to stay in the top five for the team championship,” head coach Dave Salo said. “With one day left we have a shot of moving into the top five, but it will take some ‘Fight On’ Trojan efforts tomorrow morning.”
In the final day of competition on Saturday, Chenault joined Ishimatsu on the leaderboard with her first NCAA scoring swim in the 200y fly, winning the ‘B’ final with a personal best 1:53.17 after going 1:55.24 in prelims.
Wilk posted a personal best in the prelims of the 100y free, a 48.12 to earn her first career 100y free scoring opportunity. In the ‘B’ final, she finished second in 48.24, 0.01 out of first.
Weiss posted a personal best 1:53.16 in the 200y back prelims, finishing 12th to earn a second swim. In the ‘B’ final, she finished seventh (15th overall) with a 1:53.96.
“We had a very good meet,” Salo said. “We just came up short on some points. I’m very proud of this team. Chelsea had a fantastic 200 fly, an event that she only swam one other time this year. We are walking away from this meet without a trophy but with a great foundation to build on.”
The men’s swimming and diving team won it’s first Pac-12 title since 1979 and will compete in the NCAA Championships March 26-28 in Iowa City, Iowa.
Losing out to Cal by 350 points is a sad state of affairs. The team tied for eighth which is not mentioned. No lack of scholarships in women sports compared to a state school so what is the excuse. How could the coach say we just came up short with the
big discrepancy to the top three teams. Maybe time to split the coaching duties for men and women squads like tennis, golf,
and volleyball.

Pearl and the Beard’s interesting band name is only the beginning of the unique and captivating style of the Brooklyn indie trio. Percussionist Jocelyn Mackenzie, cellist and pianist Emily Hope Price and guitarist Jeremy Styles share the duty of vocals.
The band released its latest single, just finished a tour with indie pop band Wild Child, and has shared the stage with Matt & Kim, The Drums and Ingrid Michaelson. They released their first EP, At Home With Pearl and the Beard in 2008. In 2009, they produced their first full-length album entitled God Bless Your Weary Soul, Amanda Richardson. Two years later, their second album, Killing the Darlings, was released. They are currently in the final stages of producing their third album.
The band’s name promises an epic tale and, while there are no Moby Dick-esque stories of heroes and heroines named Pearl or the Beard, the reasoning behind it is just as intriguing. Price explained that when Mackenzie and Styles got together, the band was named Pearl and the Beard. Mackenzie is a knitter familiar with a specific knitting technique known as purling. She liked the sound of the word but spelled it “pearl”-ing. The two words, pearl and beard, share similar structures. The two band mates, in addition to a mutual appreciation for word symmetry, enjoyed the way the words sounded together. In the end, she says it’s up to the listener to decide the meaning.
“There is no beard — imagine it’s just a title of a book or a story that continues on and on forever weaving its way through,” Price said. “Pearl is not a person either. There is no pearl, there is no beard.”
The band’s sound is made up of only the best components; brilliant lyrics, beautiful instrumentals and powerful vocals. Yet, the true beauty is found in the cohesive and astounding sound of all the components combined. Listeners might be surprised to learn that there are only three band members, considering each song comes with the strength of an entire orchestra. Each track is fresh and original with a different vocalist.
“In the past, it’s been whoever initiated the song or were more attached to the song,” Price said.  “On this new album, it was more about painting a picture appropriately and [choosing which vocalist] was right for the song.”
Their mastery of music stems from their ability to provide both subtlety and power. Their lyrics can be evocative as well as simple, but they are always brought to life with the soft and swelling vocals.
“Once we have the feeling of a theme or something that feels right, we kind of sculpt it from there,” Price said on the trio’s writing process. “I do a lot of illustration. I can’t illustrate real life — I mean I can, but I prefer drawing, thinking out of nowhere, so what ends up happening is if my pen leaks on the page or smears, you involve the smear in the illustration … that can, a lot of ways, work for music in a lot of ways … that kind of stuff that happens naturally to a moment, and help it feel like a whole piece.”
A conversation with Price illustrates the quality of the band. Her relaxed eloquence comes across in such a wonderfully warm manner that it’s impossible to not want to both learn from her wisdom and hug her.
The band’s passion for its music is in every aspect, whether it’s an interview, a live performance or its album. The phrase “it’s in their genes” has never been more applicable. Pearl and the Beard was made to make music. And its passion keeps growing and driving them and its music.
Price shared one anecdote during her time performing with the R&B singer songwriter D’Angelo. He was closing a set with his hit song “How Does it Feel,” and she said there was a palpable connection with the performer, even though he has performed the track countless times.
“He was singing every word like it was the last time he was singing it,” she said. “That experience I had is the experience I want to have and I want to give to people.”
The band just released a single on SPIN and is currently on tour with Ani Difranco.

Ever since high school, I pictured myself spending the second semester of my junior year abroad in Spain, finally becoming fluent — or, at least being able to hold a solid conversation in the language I had been learning since middle school. Yet, when it came time for me to apply, there was one part of the USC Madrid program that was making me hesitant: the required homestay.
I toyed with the idea of going to London instead, where I could live in my own apartment, cook my own food and live with people I already knew, since most of my friends were going to London.
Luckily, my parents talked me out of this idea and reminded me that getting out of my comfort zone was a good thing, and I’ve never been more grateful. Living in a homestay has been an integral part of my study abroad experience. I can’t imagine enjoying my semester as much as I have without my host family, and I know I wouldn’t feel nearly as integrated into the Spanish culture without them either.
That’s not to say that adjusting to my homestay was easy. It took a few weeks to acclimate. In fact, it’s an ongoing process that I think will go on throughout the semester as I continue to learn new things everyday.
Upon my arrival to Madrid, there were a few things that immediately took me by surprise: the double-cheek kiss that my host mom greeted me with, the full leg of ham in our kitchen and the fact that my 75-plus-year-old host parents didn’t speak a word of English.
The first night was overwhelming. We ate a nearly two-hour dinner (when it comes to meals in Spain it’s a marathon not a sprint), and I tried to keep up with the conversation in a language I only had a mild control over. On top of this, my host parents bickered like the old married couple they are, with the arguments going back-and-forth like a pong-pong match.
Going to bed that night in my tiny room that’s only a little bigger than my closet at home, I thought for sure I’d regret my decision to come to Spain. I worried I’d spend the next four and a half months wishing I hadn’t come at all.
By the time my jet lag wore off, however, I knew I had made the right decision. During the first weeks, I learned so much about Spanish culture — much of which was by trial and error. For example, the fact that Spaniards always wear slippers in their homes (it’s considered rude to walk around barefoot at home), they’re very conscious about energy conservation — we have a limited supply of hot water, and lights are always off in rooms and hallways unless a person is physically in the room — and Spaniards generally require much less personal space than we’re used to in the U.S. Spaniards are also much more blunt than Americans. If you gain a few pounds, look particularly tired one day or get a bad haircut, you’ll know about it.
Every night when I eat dinner with my host parents, we watch the news in Spanish, which provides an invaluable experience to not only improve my language skills, but also learn about Spain’s current events. Our subsequent conversations about what is being discussed on the news have taught me important lessons about the political, social and economic climate of the country.
Most of all, I learned that Spanish people are kind, caring and passionate. (You really haven’t seen passion until you’ve seen a woman older than my grandma yell at the television rooting for Athletico Madrid.) I truly feel like my host parents try to make me feel like one of their own children and care deeply about my well-being. Whether my host mom is helping me with my Spanish, packing me a lunch to bring to the airport or folding my laundry, it’s the small things that show me that they really care. I thought living in a homestay would be much more of a transaction — that I was just paying for meals and a place to sleep. In reality, it’s been so much more than that, to the point where I really feel like I have a family in Spain.
Even when my parents — my real parents, that is — came to visit Madrid, my host parents made an active attempt to make sure they felt welcome. When my parents and I took them out for lunch, my host mom ordered all the Spanish specialties on the menu so that my mom and dad could have an authentic taste of Spain. She insisted that my parents come to the apartment for dinner, knowing that that my parents speak no Spanish and that they wouldn’t be able to communicate without me translating for everyone. The fact that this didn’t even matter to my host mom and that she really just wanted to get to know my family was an incredibly kind gesture.
Of course, there are times when living with my host parents is frustrating, like when I dislike the food being served or when, after the third time something is repeated, I still can’t understand what they’re telling me. But ultimately, it’s taught me so much about Spain, its people and culture –— and not to mention greatly improving my grasp on Spanish. Living in a homestay has provided a perspective that would have been impossible to gain any other way as an American student studying abroad, and I cannot recommend it more highly.

In 2014, President Barack Obama touted Yemen as the golden child of his counterterrorism program. At the time, such seemed to be the case. As soon as President Abdu Rabu Mansour Hadi took office in 2012 with the help of U.S. ally Saudi Arabia, Yemen grew closer to becoming a full-fledged democracy and a helpful ally in the fight against terrorism.
All of that changed, however, when the Houthi-militant group seized control of the capital in January and pushed Hadi out of office. Further unrest has forced the United States to pull all troops out of Yemen and suspend the operation of the embassy. The Houthi’s hostile takeover has pushed Yemen to a state of revolt and chaos. As allies to Yemen, the United States should have an interest in diluting this unrest to begin with.
The concern, however, is not that the Houthis will take over Yemen. The greatest concern for the United States is that the unrest in Yemen will give al Qaeda too much wiggle room. The U.S. still considers the infamous terrorist group to be the biggest threat to citizen safety. They possess the most powerful bomb-making tool of all known terrorist groups. Al Qaeda is not shying away from using them to attack Americans at home or in the air either. The United States has prevented at least three al Qaeda attacks on airplanes since 2009.
Further political unrest in Yemen will give terrorist groups like al Qaeda and ISIS free rein to grow and plot. If the United States wishes to remain in control of terrorism in the Middle East, which the last two administrations have strongly indicated as a priority, regaining an ally in Yemen is crucial. It is true that no one player in Yemen is the perfect pick, but it seems that of the options, Hadi is the only effective choice.
The Houthis may appear to be an appealing option, given that they have fought al Qaeda stronger than any previous Yemeni force. The group’s motto of “God is Great, Death to America, Death to Israel, Curse on the Jews, Victory to Islam,” however, isn’t exactly promising. The Houthi motto was adopted in 2004 when the president at the time was supporting the United States presence in the Shiite-majority Iraq, the same faction of Islam as the Houthi.
The other two predominant terrorist groups at play, al Qaeda and the newly relevant Sanna province that claims loyalty to ISIS, are also clearly not viable allies. And unfortunately, the unrest in the capital created by the Houthis has served only to create chaos for ISIS loyalists and al Qaeda to thrive.
The United States has found an ally in Hadi in the fight against al Qaeda and other terrorist groups harbored in the area as soon as he became president. Estimates indicate that United States drone strikes have killed between 836 and 1,100 people in Yemen since 2002, most of whom the New America Foundation has identified as militants. Such attacks were done in conjunction with Hadi, who provided approval and intelligence necessary for the attacks to happen.
With Hadi back in power, the Obama administration would have the ability to continue its counterterrorism efforts without deploying thousands of American troops. The U.S. training bases that had been stationed in Yemen and intelligence given to the U.S. by Hadi are invaluable to the fight against terrorism. Stability in Yemen would just be an added bonus to stunting the growth of al Qaeda and other terrorist organizations operating in the area.
The road to getting him back into power is a completely different, and much longer, story. But without Hadi in office, the United States has no hope in returning Yemen back to its previous status.

Despite its previously held majority support, the Justice for Victims of Trafficking Act failed to pass through Congress on March 17 due to the inclusion of an anti-abortion provision. The passage of the human trafficking bill was met with a filibuster led by the Democratic party, delaying the issue for further revision across party lines.
Consequently, the dispute has stymied the official confirmation of President Barack Obama’s United States attorney general nominee, Loretta Lynch, as the GOP contends that her admittance is contingent upon the bill’s clearance.
The controversy lies in the bill’s covert language dictating that the measure, which would provide a fund for victims of trafficking, prohibits the use of government funding for abortion. Otherwise known as the Hyde Amendment, this provision was inserted only in the final version of the bill. Yet, a majority of Democrats chose not to read the revised version. In an effort to validate themselves, they blamed their lack of knowledge regarding the bill’s anti-abortion language on the carelessness of their staffers and Republican counterparts. It is not only completely irresponsible for lawmakers to misrepresent their constituents in this way, but also discrediting to congressional legitimacy and accountability. Unfortunately, fundamental reparations for the victims have succumbed to the back-and-forth discord between Democrats and Republicans.
Evidently, placing the bill’s survival in the hands of political partisanship is a blatant offense to the preservation of criminal justice and human rights for the victims of what is widely regarded as modern-day slavery. By failing to communicate rationally, both parties are to blame for allowing gridlock to obfuscate the bill’s original purpose of reform. It is civil negligence. Clearly, policymakers are turning an issue of human rights into a game of technicality and political checkmarks.
On the slight-of-hand inclusion of anti-abortion language, Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid said, “Republicans are committed to turning a bipartisan bill into an unrelated, unconscionable political fight. There is a provision in this bill dealing with abortion which has nothing to do with this … Democrats will not allow a bill that helps the victims of human trafficking and child pornography be hijacked by a Republican ploy.”
This amendment is simply a promotion of special interests under the guise of pro-life insensitivity. The pressing importance of this bill supersedes the need to capitalize on issues concerning partisan interference. An urgent matter, the bill provides federal and state law enforcement with training and tools necessary to deal with the issues of trafficking. Creating a system for governmental accountability and sustainable development is necessary for victims. Grants provide monetary assistance but do not solve the systemic errors allowing for trafficking to occur. By including the anti-abortion language into this bill, Republicans are consciously marginalizing victims, cheating them of support they deserve.
Following this pattern of partisan irresponsibility, it is no coincidence that the delay of Lynch’s confirmation and the controversiality of the trafficking bill go hand-in-hand. Bound to the bill’s clearance, her official confirmation has remained in limbo, as Lynch, the first female African-American nominee, has waited longer than the last seven attorney generals combined. The delay is a disservice to the sanctity of the judicial system and a huge hindrance to its overall progression, facilitating the place of a lame-duck attorney general.
The anti-abortion provision must be removed. The passage of the trafficking bill, the confirmation of the attorney general and the future of victims are immobilized, stagnant because of political gridlock. According to the U.S. Department of Justice, approximately 300,000 American children are detrimentally affected by the egregious sex-trade industry, and this number will continue to increase, as these children stay put due to modern-day slavery, while this type of dirty partisanship continues.

For decades, Yemen has been marked by economic turmoil and political instability. This unrest came to a peak Sunday as Houthi rebels — Shiite Muslims who feel discriminated against in a mostly Sunni nation — took over Taiz, Yemen’s third largest city. With the capital city, Sanaa, already surrendered to the insurgents, U.N. officials have declared the nation as “on the edge of civil war.” The unstable security issue has prompted the 100 American Special Operations forces members previously stationed in Yemen to withdraw, illustrating that diminishing American military involvement in the conflict is the most beneficial for international relations.
Yemen, though not a country typically at the forefront of conflicts in the Middle East, directly affects many Western nations due to its position as a safehouse for terrorist operations such as al Qaeda and ISIS. Extremist takeover further establishes opacity for these terrorist groups during a time when intelligence is essential in providing insight into these organizations that are shrouded in mystery. So, it’s understandable for the U.S. to assert a role in the fighting in Yemen.
Further analysis, however, reveals the unnecessary and even harmful results of U.S. military participation. For one, history suggests failure when American troops get involved. During the Vietnam War, the U.S. aided South Vietnam in fighting communist agenda, but did not succeed in the eradication of communism. In addition to not meeting their goals, American forces were overrun by the North Vietnam communist power. While fighting communism in Cuba, the U.S. was met with some of the same results as they did in Vietnam, blasted by even more violence when helping Cuban rebels. But perhaps the most glaring example of negative U.S. foreign action has been the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq. With the War in Afghanistan drawing out for more than 14 years and claiming thousands of soldiers’ and civilians’ lives a 2013 Washington Post poll revealed that the majority of Americans do not think that the war was worth fighting. These past occurrences indicate a need for an alternative to military force.
An alternative was proposed by U.N. official Jamal Benomar, who said, that “peaceful dialogue is the only way forward.” And though Benomar acknowledged the fragile and dangerous state of Yemen, his sentiment relayed that the whole world needs to work together in order to resolve this difficult issue. Rather than having American forces aggressively attack the nation and sacrificing innocent lives in the process, the United States and its allies must enter into negotiations with the rebel forces. This way, events such as the Mosque bombings in Sana’a and battles between the two Yemeni factions can subsist.
Furthermore, pro-Hadi-United States efforts to contain the Houthi rebels must dissipate. In recent years, Yemen and the U.S. have worked closely together to defeat terrorist groups like al Qaeda, even joining forces to kill Anwar Awlaki, an important al Qaeda figure, in 2011. President Barack Obama has praised this partnership, saying “partnering and intelligence-sharing with that local government” is the most effective method of eliminating terrorism. But that was then. With Yemen’s current political milieu, it is hard to maintain relations with a nation bogged by supreme distress, Hadi having been deposed after the coup at Sana’a. With no apparent leader and persistent factions fighting each other, the U.S. engaging in a further relations with Yemen could lead to infractions upon our domestic tranquility.
Hopefully, as Hadi optimistically puts it, “the Houthis will not last.” Though the Houthi insurgents are a domineering group imposing terror upon the Yemeni population, they can be halted with the sheer power of negotiation before even considering drastic measures such as using violence.

On March 16, Kendrick Lamar released his newest project, To Pimp A Butterfly (TPAB). Up until its release, little was known about TPAB aside from the release of two singles – “i,” and “The Blacker the Berry.” But nothing could have possibly prepared Kendrick fans for what they received with this project – a highly complex, incredibly dense, and sonically adventurous tour de force.
Let’s wind back a few years for context. With the release of Good Kid m.A.A.D City (GKMC) in October 2012, Lamar went from rap’s underdog to one of its top players. Just less than a year later, Kendrick dropped an ambitious and highly controversial verse on Big Sean’s “Control,” officially commencing his reign as the King of Rap. Ever since, the music community has been eagerly awaiting Kendrick’s second major label album; many wondered how Kendrick could possibly top GKMC, which received rave reviews from critics and fans alike.
As with Kendrick’s two previous releases, TPAB is not merely a series of songs; it is essentially a collection of vignettes that are pieced together with spoken word delivered throughout the album. The message is multifaceted – there are themes of self-loathing, racial discrimination and rebirth.
The first two tracks set the sonic tone for the album. The opener, “Wesley’s Theory,” featuring vocals from funk legend George Clinton and instrumentation from bass virtuoso Thundercat, is pure funk. But Kendrick is not merely imitating the p-funk of the 70’s, he’s giving TPAB its own distinct aesthetic. The second track, “For Free? (Interlude),” flips to pure jazz. Kendrick shows his incredible vocal versatility here (as he does on the entire album) as he speedily raps about being taken advantage of financially by a girlfriend and by the government (an idea established in “Wesley’s Theory”).
With these two tracks, Kendrick establishes early on that this will not be another Good Kid m.A.A.D. City — this is a beast of its own, one that tackles a broader range of issues than its predecessor. In “u,” perhaps the album’s most powerful song, Kendrick is berated by his conscious for neglecting his family and friends in Compton after becoming famous. Kendrick’s broken, emotional delivery is heart-wrenching, especially as you hear him swig down bottles of liquor. This song is the antithesis to “i,” the album’s penultimate track; whereas “i” is about loving and accepting yourself, “u” depicts a state of near suicidal self-hate.
The theme of being morally corrupted by fame continues with “For Sale? (Interlude),” where Lucifer (referred to as “Lucy”) lures Kendrick into “signing a contract” with her. The instrumental is lush and layered, comforting yet eerie, making it a perfect complement to Kendrick’s lyrics.
The album then shifts as Kendrick returns home and reconnects with his roots. He finds himself up to his old shenanigans with his homies on “Hood Politics.” He also continues to make bold statements about the government exploitation of black people, likening Democrats and Republicans to Crips and Bloods.
“The Blacker the Berry” is the most racially charged song of the album. It presents discrimination and the African-American struggle as dynamic issues. Kendrick angrily confronts racists and the history of oppression in this country. But he also confronts lack of self-respect in some black communities and black-on-black crimes. He spits over a beat reminiscent of the hardcore boom-bap days of the early nineties. Assassin, who also appeared on Kanye West’s “I’m In It,” delivers a fantastic hook that adds to the intensity of the track.
The album closes perfectly with “Mortal Man,” a 12-minute epic that contains a 7-minute posthumous “interview” with Tupac. The idea is incredibly innovative and powerful. In a sense the interview gives the album context, but it does not provide closure. Kendrick reminds us that there is still much work to be done.
An artist can be influential not only through the music he or she creates, but also the ambition displayed. Kendrick’s ambition is rare. Instead of taking the safe route and creating a copy of GKMC, Kendrick was bold. With TPAB, Kendrick embraces the album as a true piece of art, and by doing so, he has transcended rap. Now the only question is, how will he top this one?
RATING: 10/10

“Chillin’ in Chile” is a popular catchphrase among English-speaking exchange students…y’know, because alliterations are clever. While I wouldn’t say that I’m a particularly uptight person to begin with (depending on whom you ask), I sometimes struggle with this thing called “chilling out.”
To illustrate this, let’s talk about this picture of me kayaking: I look happy because I’m doing this thing called a weekend-excursion-for-exchange-students-to-get-to-know-Chile-better and I’d just gotten in the river, not yet realizing how much my noodle arms were about to struggle. Basically what happened was, I couldn’t keep my kayak from spinning and almost flipped over because I was paddling with an incredibly frustrated determination to move forward. Eventually, I had to just take off my glasses so that I couldn’t see how far ahead of me everyone else was, and had to just be chill with the river’s currents.
Anyway, here are some other ways being in Chile has nudged me into chillness:
To clarify, I define chillness not as the absence of caring at all, but rather an approach to taking action that allows you the opportunity to see potential paths you might have not considered to be options before — be more adventurous, etc. I think being chill is a practical skill to have so that you don’t waste your energy fighting the flow when you can be working with the flow to get where you want to go. But being too chill can often lead to complacency and inaction; some people just don’t have the privilege to not worry, especially if their society’s flow is designed against them.
With that said, chillness, for me, is an attitude that’s highly influenced by the context of my surrounding environment. Ultimately, I recognize that my ability to sometimes be chill in Chile is partially a product of my being in a place where I can afford to “go with the flow” because I am considered transitory both legally and socially, and my stakes for survival are not wholly dependent my ability to “succeed” in Chilean society.
