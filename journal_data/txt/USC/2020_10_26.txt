Asleep, Where Do We Go?” back in March of this year. However, her tour was quickly postponed because of the coronavirus pandemic. On Saturday, she was back performing a livestream concert with incredible visuals, stunning vocals and a strong message to get out and vote. 
The livestream began with Eilish talking to her crew; she explained how so many people have either lost their jobs or have been unable to do them because of the pandemic, her touring crew included. She emphasized the importance of doing this show for them and, of course, for her fans at home. We also got a special glimpse into her documentary that is coming out in 2021.
She kicked off the concert with her hit song “Bury a Friend.” From the start, Eillish’s unmatched energy and vocals were on display. What could have been awkward silences between each song ended up being moments filled with applause from her crew and words of love and motivation from Eilish herself.
Known for her interesting music videos, sets and creative direction, this concert was no exception. The incredible XR-technology, creative camera shots and 3D design created an experience unlike any other. You were able to step into each song and see the world Eilish had imagined for each.
Eilish then performed her song, “My Strange Addiction.” The electronic beat had her on her feet and moving. She has previously stated that her own strange addiction is the show “The Office,” so the song includes sampled quotes from the episode “Threat Level Midnight” weaved into the lyrics.
Moving seamlessly from song to song, Eilish then sang “Ocean Eyes.” The iconic song shot her to fame in 2016 when she was only 14 years old. Her whispered singing voice and beautiful tone instantly drew in the audience. This was a stark contrast to her previous songs as Eilish took a more simple and relaxed method to performing this song. 
Next came my all-time favorite song: “I Love You.” The love song shows a softer and more emotional side to Eilish. She sings this song flawlessly accompanied by her brother, Finneas, on the guitar; the co-writer and producer of all of Eilish’s songs. 
The show then picked back up with her song “Ilomilo,” another upbeat performance with crazy visuals. During the song, the audience was immersed in an underwater scene with seaweed and ocean animals. This creative take added an extra layer because it felt like we were in the song as opposed to just listening to it. Eilish’s creative choice matched the song perfectly.
Then came one of Eilish’s newer songs, “No Time to Die,” the featured song in the next James Bond movie. Although the release of the movie has been pushed back, Eilish’s song has been out for months and shows a different side to her vocals. While she is usually more soft and delicate, in “No Time to Die,” Eilish really belts at the peak moment of the song as the orchestra rises behind her. The song highlights all of Eilish’s range and she sings it just as well live as she does in the recording.
Eilish continued her performance with “When the Party’s Over” and “All the Good Girls to Hell.” Both songs are cult favorites and show off Eilish’s two sides: one softer and more emotional, the other more dark and electronic. 
Between each song Eilish repeatedly talked about how much she missed performing and her fans. She has always been very outspoken about politics and her beliefs on social media, and the livestream was no exception. Plastered on the screen behind her was a powerful statement: “No Music on a Dead Planet.” Eilish encouraged her young fans to get out and vote and make a change and talked about how she just recently voted and how change needs to happen in this manner. 
From there, Eilish went into her song “Everything I Wanted.” Behind her were live videos of fans who were watching the stream, all singing along. It was an emotional performance that perfectly showcased her relationship with her fans. As her fans disappeared behind her, Eilish began to sing her newest song “My Future,” which she released during the lockdown. The song’s beautiful message and jazz-like quality instantly lifts your spirits, especially during these hard times. 
Eilish closed out her show with her hit song, “Bad Guy.” Its upbeat rhythm makes the song the perfect way to close out any performance; it’s guaranteed to make you dance.
Livestream concerts can be hard. Without any fans to create energy in the venue, artists can seem lost or unenthusiastic. Not Billie Eillish. She came out with all the same energy, put on a great show, and showed so much love and appreciation to her fans. Although watching a concert from your bed is not quite the same experience, in today’s world, I think we all will take what we can get.

Jagshemash! 
Borat is back! In 2006, Sacha Baron Cohen introduced the world to Borat Sagdiyev, a reporter from Kazakhstan on a mission to document his travels in the “US and A.” During his first visit, he pulled outrageous stunts like wrestling naked with his producer in a hotel room and kidnapping Pamela Anderson. His absurd comedy relied on anonymity; nobody knew who Borat Sagdiyev was. He could get away with certain stunts because no one saw them coming. 
Fourteen years later, this has drastically changed. Borat has become a cultural icon, well known across the United States. The joke of Borat being an anonymous troll is ruined. After all, it’s impossible to have a gag relying on anonymity when everyone knows who you are. This was the biggest obstacle the reprisal had to tackle. What to do when everyone is in on the joke? The answer: give Borat a daughter. 
“Borat Subsequent Moviefilm” begins by catching us up on what has happened since we last saw Borat. He has been digging trenches in a gulag for the last 14 years as punishment for embarrassing Kazakhstan. Now, he is out and given a mission to return to the United States and deliver a monkey, who serves as Kazakhstan’s Minister of Culture, to Vice President Mike Pence. After he lands in Texas he says rude and racist things to the locals, prompting chuckles and shocked faces, relying on the same tropes he used in the first movie. 
But he quickly runs into the issue of people recognizing him. Cohen’s character has become too iconic — when people see him, they know they are getting conned. Although his character tries to employ disguises to mask his identity, it does not have the same effect. Nothing can top the comedic relief provided by Cohen’s first film, in which no one knew who Borat was.
Despite no longer having the advantage of anonymity, Borat did not lose his ability to show how concepts like racism and antisemitism have become mainstream. He goes to a rally against the stay-at-home order during the coronavirus pandemic and sings a song about how “Obama was a traitor … America he hate her” or we should “inject him [Obama] with the Wuhan flu.” His music is met with fervent enthusiasm from his crowd. He then experiences a crisis of faith after being told the Holocaust was fake, and cheers after speaking to a Holocaust survior and learning it was real. His stunts are just as uncomfortable as they were in the first film.
The best part of the Borat sequel quickly becomes apparent: his daughter Tutar (Maria Bakalova). Because of her anonymity, she manages to bring back the shock value the original movie relied on. Her stunts are abstract, from teaching a women’s group how to masturbate to claiming her father put a baby in her after accidentally swallowing a decorative plastic baby on a cupcake. Her plot line is delightfully complicated; she is the 15 year-old devoted daughter of Borat who sneaks her way into the United States by eating a monkey originally intended to be a gift for Pence. 
Then in the United States, she learns how to be a feminist, rebels against her father, before finally offering herself to Rudy Giuliani, a former Mayor of New York City. Tutar’s chaotic storyline is fun and unpredictable, mimicking the spontaneity and excitement viewers were introduced to in the first film. She is the best part about this sequel and the movie’s answer to how to cope with the ruined joke. The addition of a daughter was an interesting attempt to make Borat a family man. Surprisingly, it gives a previously flat individual character development and adds a wonderful wholesome element to the film.  
The movie ends with a unique take on the spread of the coronavirus, claiming the virus was orchestrated by Kazakhstan and Borat was patient zero. It is a satirical finale that makes light of an awful situation, something the original Borat film did very well. 
The film is fun and shocking, yet it does not have the same magic as the original. Is it because the joke is no longer funny? Or, is it because the movie is not necessary? 
When the original Borat film was released during the height of the Bush Administration, it was a way of making jokes out of serious social issues, like antisemitism and homophobia, that were not widely discussed at the time. Much has changed since 2006. Issues that were once avoided are now discussed openly in the media. 
Former President George W. Bush’s words and actions were more discrete compared to President Donald Trump’s. There is no need to expose Trump for controversial remarks he has made because he is so open with his beliefs. Therefore, Borat making jokes about the current president or vice president are not shocking or surprising. These jokes have been made consistently over the past four years. There is no need to hear them again. 
While the jokes about the current administration come off as slightly stale and unoriginal, they do not detract much from the overall quality of the movie. We certainly didn’t need another Borat film, but this is a fun, enjoyable follow-up.

Halloween is my least favorite holiday. Horror is my least favorite genre. And you might roll your eyes at the reason — yes, I’m afraid. You know that guy who won’t even watch “IT” because just the reviews sound scary? That’s me. I did watch “IT” eventually — true, wasn’t that scary — but it took me a while, and it didn’t do much in quelling my fear. “Horror-phobia” I would call it. I think that’s a pretty good term, actually, because I am literally afraid of being afraid, especially at the movies. 
The last movie I watched before movie theaters closed doors was “Invisible Man.” To seasoned horror fans, that film would probably not be considered authentic “horror.” It’s got all the tropes — anxious protagonist, maniacal villain, a fair share of blood — but it is far too mild and, even for a whacked genre, a bit too far-fetched. But, watching it revealed to me that what I was really afraid of was not an ugly monster or a brutally violent scene (displeasing as they are if not done well), I was really afraid of being afraid. “Invisible Man” is a very suspenseful movie; even if the pay-off isn’t visually shocking, what you don’t see is arguably scarier. When nothing is happening, we brace ourselves. Fear and anxiety paralyze us precisely when all is quiet and calm. 
Bear with me as I probe my fear (and perhaps yours) just a little deeper: Why are we most afraid when everything is calm? Of course, without those silent moments, there would be no horror genre. And it’s because we know we are watching a horror film that we know something’s coming — the silence can’t last long. But, if we know that a jump scare is just a second away, why are we still scared? Why do I still jump when I have spent the past few seconds bracing myself? On a related note, why do we choose to go to haunted houses or Halloween mazes and still get scared when that is precisely why we go?
What happens in that split-second right before the actual scare? Personally, I’m preparing myself by imagining everything that could possibly happen. Where could the serial killer come from? Is he behind this corner or the next one? What if he’s behind me? The state of not knowing is excruciating, but it’s where suspense is born. If a film handles those moments well — creates an uncertain, unpredictable environment effectively — it does not matter whether the monster, serial killer or ghost is scary-looking. The work has been cut out for it. 
But, what’s even more fascinating to me is that, once this process is complete, we want it to happen again. If we didn’t, horror movies would cease to be scary after the first scare. Filmmakers know that the audience wants to be scared. They don’t, however, make the monster scarier or the serial killer more threatening — it’s the moment of suspense that they ramp up with every scene. Sometimes the silence is prolonged, other times it’s shortened and we are genuinely shocked. This is what makes Alfred Hitchcock not the master of horror, but the “master of suspense;” his movies aren’t scary (so I watch them), but they are quite frightening because he expertly toys with the moment of suspense, keeping us on edge, making us afraid of being afraid. 
Some of us want zombies, others are fascinated by paranormal activity, still others are intrigued by sci-fi horror. The good thing is we have all these types of films at our disposal this Halloween week. I was considering writing this column perhaps on the “canon” of classic Halloween films; or on my personal favorites. But those kinds of discussions are bland, nothing more than opinion. There is no best horror (or any genre) film ever made. But all of them operate on the basis of our biggest fear. Whether we’re drawn to popular horror or a strange sub-genre of our choosing, I think a worthwhile exercise can be to think on why we get so scared and why we keep coming back. We are all, ultimately, scared of being scared. But, every year around this time we willingly subject ourselves to more frights. So the question for each of us becomes — not ‘what am I most afraid of?” — but “why is being afraid so fun?”

Jean Dawson is a product of the digital age. Embracing the constant influx of information, the experimental 24-year-old transforms each passing influence into a new variable in his curated world. 
Following his 2019 debut “Bad Sports,” the recent sophomore album “Pixel Bath” released on Oct. 23. The five preceding singles including “Bruiseboy,” “Power Freaks” and “Devilish” provided a dynamic look into Dawson’s hyperactive imagination. 
Raised in Tijuana before moving to San Diego, the biracial artist has experience maneuvering between liminal spaces. Born to a Mexican mother and Black father, the culture clashes and fluctuations directly translate into his creative work.
In an interview with MTV, Dawson explained the vision behind the album. 
“I want it to be controlled chaos. I just want it to feel like you’re in multiple places at the same exact time,” Dawson said. The forward-thinking vision for the album proves Dawson’s vibrant edge. 
Throughout the 38-minute long project, Dawson preserves an unmatched energy allowing for his clear-cut lyrics to shine. The combination of Y2K nostalgia seeps through the unique mechanical sounds. And the ease in which he crafts high-voltage alternative rock melodies with innovative rap-like flows is praiseworthy.
On “Clear Bones,” the track’s evocative lyricism develops a playful depiction of the momentary and fleeting. The delivery of the taunting lines, “Mr. Reaper, will you wait on me? / Mr. Reaper, let’s play hide and seek” shift the song from an otherwise morbid reflection to a consumable take.
His ability to take the harsh realities of life into a charismatic form speaks to artistry. On the bilingual track “Policia,” Dawson timely sings about the effects of police brutality. The song uses strong exclamations such as, “No me cae bien la policía / que chingen a su madre, azul y rojo brujería” to serve as an immediate outlet for his collective rage. 
The single “Starface*” is a collection of late-night thoughts and candid questioning. The fast-paced beats and electronically-modified vocal tracks amplify its complexity. Closing out with a fading of twinkling high melodies, the song is an example of the escapism music provides.
The supporting visuals for each respective single replicate the cinematic level of the project. Dawson creates a physical representation of his gritty neon visions. 
For the “Starface*” music video, the range of saturated shots and wobbly angles delivers images that pair well. Dawson leads the creative direction for most videos, highlighting his ability to operate in the visual spaces as equally in the sonic.
Immersed in the creative social sphere in Los Angeles, Dawson has developed working creative relationships with a range of remarkable artists. Previous collaborations include a feature, alongside peer Omar Apollo on musical artist Deaton Chris Anthony’s “Late Night Lovin’.”
On “Triple Double,” Dawson recruits none other than A$AP Rocky to add another layer of complexity to the track. The shift of visionary tone develops artistic freedom for both artists on the track. With string-striking guitar chords, the clear tone of the project creates an unbounded field of provocative sounds.
Jaw-dropping track “06 Burst” achieves an unnatural cohesion with the incorporation of sporadic elements and shifting vocals. The striking outro captures a tempo switch that when paired with the robotic repetition of the line “I don’t keep score / I keep scoring,” creates an unreal work. 
The boundary-breaking undertaking of “Pixel Bath” takes no notice of reductive labels. Aware of the dilution that occurs with categorization, Dawson’s insouciant mind-frame disregards it completely. The forward-thinking project is a new-age classic for the seemingly unconventional.  
A few hours before release day, Dawson tweeted to fans: “Listen to it loud – scream it in your room – remember it’s for you.” Jean Dawson builds his own multi-dimensional culture and in doing so authorizes others to do the same.
“Pixel Bath” is now available on all streaming platforms.

During this election cycle, heavy hitters and revenue giants such as CNN, MSNBC and Fox News are front and center for contentious debates, town halls and scathing primetime opinion segments. However, an underappreciated and underrecognized yet critical part of news (in and out of election years) comes from the nonprofit sector. 
Without profit in mind, nonprofit journalism may care less about eye-catching headlines or quotable opinions and more about investigative reporting and the dissemination of nonpartisan information to the public. This difference allows for nonprofit news organizations to occupy a unique space in journalism and, in a time of polarization and misinformation, that is the exact reason we need it more than ever.  
Well-known examples of nonprofit news organizations include National Public Radio, Pew Research Center, PBS NewsHour and ProPublica. Interest in nonprofit journalism rose following the 2008 recession and saw a resurgence after the 2016 presidential election. In fact, journalism philanthropy has quadrupled in the last decade, while advertising revenue for for-profit news has steadily declined.  
As local news falters, it is vital that nonprofit organizations fill the gap left behind. Today, 350 nonprofit public television stations reach a monthly 120 million viewers with 65 million listeners tuning in to more than 900 public radios. Beyond live coverage, public media stations engage tens of millions through articles and downloads. 
These news organizations find funding from listener donations and occasional government support, whereas a cable news organization like CNN, MSNBC and Fox News make a profit off advertising and subscriber fees from cable companies. Due to this, nonprofit journalism is solely meant to inform the public, without regard to a return on investment. 
Through investigative journalism, nonprofit organizations have led the way in uncovering corruption and wrongdoing. In 2018, ProPublica obtained a recording of the separation of families inside a U.S. Customs and Border Protection facility — leading to national outrage and a federal judicial order that parents and children be reunited. In direct contrast to the White House’s official statements, KPBS News revealed that this practice of family separation was not isolated to illegal border crossings but also happened at legal ports of entry. 
Nonprofit news also reports on injustices occurring at a local level. The investigative journalism nonprofit Voice of San Diego uncovered sexual misconduct by teachers and other public school employees and has gone to court to obtain records that document this abuse. Due to their reporting, they exposed abusers who could previously discreetly resign or transfer with cash payouts. 
The brand of many for-profit news organizations relies on large personalities who have an obvious political leaning shaping their opinion segments. Since nonprofit news organizations are funded by donors, they are held to a higher standard to remain as objective as possible separate from interest groups or political movements. Due to their 501(c)(3) designation, nonprofits cannot participate in activities to support or oppose political candidates. While most trusted for-profit news organizations abide by this anyways, nonprofit news has a legal obligation to do so. In for-profit news, for example, candidates may vie for endorsements or pay for political ads. 
Nonprofit news institutions have also had a hand in rectifying the current homogeneity of journalism. Organizations such as the National Association of Hispanic Journalists, Asian American Journalists Association, National Association of Black Journalists and Poynter’s Leadership Academy for Women have spearheaded the push for a more diverse, inclusive newsroom. 
 Of course, like most things in this world, nonprofit news is not without faults. A valid concern is that due to its reliance on donations, funders may influence what nonprofits report on. For example, a New York public TV station later returned a grant for a documentary series because its topic was deemed too closely connected to the donor. Moreover, the American Press Institute conducted a study that found over half of funders make media grants in areas where they do policy work and only 37% of nonprofit media has established guidelines about funding to combat this. 
Although funder and nonprofit relations raise questions about conflicts of interest, nonprofit media remains extremely transparent, with 99% disclosing donors at some level and only 4% showing content to funders pre-publication. Although reliance on donors may lead to a connection between the funder and the topics covered, the vast majority of nonprofit media keeps funding and reporting separate to the best of their ability.  
We are currently facing a misinformation dilemma. A study at MIT found that false news spreads six times faster on Twitter than real news. As access to misleading information increases, news organizations struggle to find the revenue needed to stay afloat to combat it. To fill the gap left behind by dying local news and the growing distrust in national news, nonprofit newsrooms’ core mission to offer objective, nonpartisan information without the goal of revenue is truly invaluable and necessary.

The Asian American voter bloc is more important than ever. As the fastest growing population in the United States, Asian American voters may prove to play an essential role in an increasingly diverse electorate. 
According to a report from CBS News, Asian Americans now make up more than 11 million voters in November’s election. Moreover, the increase of Asian Americans who are eligible to vote is evidence that there is a wider mobilization of Asian Americans in politics, one that will have a substantial impact on the outcome of this year’s election. 
Given these factors, it is essential to not discredit Asian American voters in this year’s election. Politicians should not undermine Asian American voters in their attempts to appeal to their audience, and Asian Americans should no longer be overlooked as a force in U.S. politics. In fact, there are certain places where an Asian American vote could make all the difference, according to Karthick Ramakrishnan, a professor at the University of California, Riverside.
In Pennsylvania, Asian Americans are the margin of victory. More and more Asian Americans in Pennsylvania are taking the initiative to promote political engagement through community education and digital tools. In Texas too, Asian Americans are located in key districts that can determine the outcomes of spots in the U.S. House of Representatives, and whether it will be Republicans or Democrats who hold those seats. 
In efforts to understand this year’s election, one must first look at a main factor promoting civic engagement among Asian American voters. Sen. Kamala Harris, who is the daughter of an Indian immigrant, not only is a clear contender for Asian American representation in politics but also resonates on a personal level for many Asian Americans, Indian Americans in particular. Harris’ willingness to share her personal stories as a biracial Black and Indian daughter of immigrants holds clear appeal for many Asian Americans, who may feel more able to connect with her identity.
This connection is even more prominent given the recent rise in xenophobic rhetoric surrounding immigration. With a growing number of Asian students who are the victims of racist attacks, it has become a pressing need to elect a candidate who is not only against racism but uniquely attuned to the needs of Asian American constituents. Paired with an Asian American voter bloc that has shifted to majority democratic, it’s clear that greater Asian American civic engagement is not only a desire for representation but a conscious effort to ensure inclusivity in all aspects of life for the Asian American population in the United States. 
Asian Americans are not a monolithic group, of course, and despite the fact that the majority of Asian American voters favor democratic candidates, there are also others who not only lean Republican but are spearheading the movement for President Donald Trump. Many Chinese immigrants in the United States have taken to platforms such as WeChat to share their support for the sitting president. These conservative so-called “Trump activists” are primarily against programs like affirmative action, which they believe to be a form of discrimination against high-achieving Asians. As a result, many have turned to civic engagement as a way of expressing their discontent with policies that they perceive to not favor inclusivity of Asian Americans. 
While these different facets of Asian American voters can be interpreted as divisive, it may be more compelling to view them as a reflection of diversity within Asian American voters. The nuances of Asian American voters and political beliefs may show politicians that Asian Americans are a complex political group and want to elect the leaders that they believe will best serve their interests.
Historically, Asian Americans have had low voter turnouts partly due to a lack of awareness — much political information may not be easily accessible in their native languages — and politicians’ failure to effectively reach this demographic. Politicians must stop undermining the Asian American population and address the concerns of this community. In the grand scheme of things, Asian American voters are a formidable force. This year’s Asian American voter turnout makes it clear that they are here and for the fate of politics, their voices matter.

The debates really heated up last week. One side continued to spew misinformation and harmful rhetoric, while the other side seemed to have solid intentions, but their past actions made their words fall flat. I usually choose not to waste my energy over things I don’t see changing, but lately, I’ve been thinking: Why can’t things change? Why can’t WNBA players get paid closer to NBA players?
For those who aren’t familiar with the popular social media debate, congratulations. It’s the same every year. Someone posts a shocking statistic like how the NBA’s minimum salary for one non-rookie player is greater than the salary cap of an entire WNBA team or how an all-time WNBA great like Sue Bird only made $215,000 this season while an NBA all-time great like LeBron James made more than that in one half of basketball. 
Before I can even certify James’ pay on my calculator, a guy is breaking down what’s wrong with the WNBA’s marketing, another guy is explaining his freshman economics course, another guy is providing a SoundCloud link or two, another makes an unnecessary reach saying WNBA players can play in the NBA and, of course, there’s an assortment of lame, sexist jokes. Like most social media debates, it’s pure chaos.
Fun fact: Before I chose the high-paying field of journalism, I wanted to be a lawyer because of how much I loved debating. One particular aspect I enjoyed was sorting through facts and finding which ones could either make or break my argument. That aspect is front and center in the yearly WNBA pay gap debate. There are truths to every common argument used in the debate, but there are also conflicting facts that break each of those truths.
For starters, the marketing argument is right. WNBA Commissioner Cathy Engelbert said it herself: “We have a marketing problem.” But, as Engelbert would go on to later explain, the league’s marketing problem stems from its restrictive economic landscape. This brings me to the freshman economics guy and his argument of the league not being profitable.
It’s true, the WNBA currently loses money yearly and doesn’t draw anywhere near the number of fans as the NBA, so there’s no feasible way WNBA players can be paid like NBA players. But what the economics guy never points out is that the WNBA doesn’t receive anywhere near the financial or media support that male professional sports leagues receive. As of 2019, all women’s sports combined to receive just 4% of sports media coverage, and despite the WNBA starting one year after the MLS and losing a tenth of the annual money the MLS loses, the average WNBA player makes less than a third of the average MLS player. And with both leagues bringing in nearly identical audiences, what’s the real excuse for the WNBA’s low pay?
It turns out there are truths to the jokes, too. They reveal true, biased feelings toward women. If a person feels inclined to make a kitchen joke after watching a special talent like Sabrina Ionescu do special things like come close to a 30-point triple-double in her second career game, they’re not funny, they’re misogynistic and a major reason why WNBA players don’t get the pay and recognition they deserve. A lot of social media users (I would love to be more specific, but they usually have memes for profile pictures) repeatedly attempt to tear down the accomplishments of some of the most talented basketball players on the planet with sexism disguised as an attempt at comedy.
And for the last of the truths, yes, the WNBA has a salary problem. Even with the financial boosts from the 2020 Collective Bargaining Agreement, there’s still a substantial pay gap between WNBA and NBA players and that’s probably never going to change considering the massive headstart the NBA had. But much like the marketing problem, the salary problem stems from something larger that, unlike the marketing and salary problems, can change right away. 
The WNBA has a respect problem, and the current rap landscape provides hope that it can be fixed.
It wasn’t long ago that women in rap had their own respect issue. The genre was deemed misogynistic, women were used as props in many rap groups and special talents were never allowed to coexist. Megan thee Stallion explained the last point best: “Us women have always been talented. But it was a thing where there could only be one woman [rapper] at a time.” 
With 11 different entries from five different women making the Billboard Year-End Hot 100 chart, 2019 saw women finally get the respect they deserve in rap, and that respect isn’t going anywhere anytime soon. With mainstream artists like Cardi B, Nicki Minaj and Megan; lyricists like Little Simz, No Name and Rapsody; and indescribable artists like Doja Cat, Rico Nasty and Tierra Whack, women in rap are as diverse and plentiful as ever, and they’re bringing just as many fans to the genre as men.
If fans of a genre as historically misogynistic as rap can rapidly embrace women like never before, what’s stopping fans of arguably the most progressive sport in the world from doing the same? Just like bars from Rapsody don’t have to sound like bars from Kendrick Lamar for rap fans to notice they’re special, Breonna Stewart shouldn’t have to play above the rim for basketball fans to appreciate her greatness. 
WNBA superstars like Stewart may never get paid like NBA superstars, but they’ve more than earned equal respect. And, who knows, if the Stewarts and Ionescus of today get that respect, maybe the next generation of WNBA superstars can close the pay gap and end the yearly debate.

Instead of taking a step back during this virtual semester, the student-led USC Community Health Involvement Project stepped up to meet the needs of the Los Angeles community when members realized that the coronavirus pandemic heightened food insecurity for many L.A. residents. 
The students opened a community fridge in Chinatown in early October to provide free and accessible food to members of the L.A. community. The community fridge is a part of Los Angeles Community Fridges, a network of 17 decentralized, independent refrigerators that provide food to communities in the L.A area.
While the community fridge is run by the USC Community Health Involvement Project, there are many community members and organizations that contribute to its success. Several restaurants in the L.A. area have agreed to donate food regularly to the fridge.
With the support and donations from restaurants and community members, the community fridge has remained fully stocked every day since it opened in early October, President of the Community Health Involvement Project Addie Kapsner said. Although the food in the community fridge is usually gone within one to two days, it is restocked nearly every day by different community volunteers.
“There’s a lot of food being donated and we are pleasantly surprised,” Kapsner said. “I was expecting to have to go between our donations to stores to get stuff to refill the fridge, but we really haven’t needed to do that much. The community is very involved, which is nice.”
Burgerlords, a vegan burger restaurant in Chinatown, plans to donate excess food to the community fridge at the end of each week. 
“We want to help however we can because of what’s going on right now and reduce the waste we’re putting out,” said Burgerlords operation manager Jessica Mata. “We’d rather know that someone is able to utilize the things we can’t, especially right now. The community needs to work together so we can get through this.” 
The Community Health Involvement Project welcomes USC students to help in restocking and maintaining the community fridge. ProjectQ founder Madin Lopez said anyone can donate to the fridge by bringing food to ProjectQ Monday through Thursday between 10 a.m. and 3 p.m. and placing the goods in the fridge. They accept donations of fresh produce, canned goods, nonperishable items, frozen meats, eggs, bread, milk, bottled water and non-alcoholic drinks.
Kapsner said the greatest challenge the organization faced in opening the community fridge was finding the right area to host the fridge. When choosing a location, they prioritized businesses owned by Black people and people of color.
Ultimately, the Community Health Involvement Project decided to place its community fridge at ProjectQ, a nonprofit in Chinatown that provides a safe space for LGBTQIA+ homeless youth.
“I’m very thankful,” said ProjectQ Executive Director Madin Lopez. “This is one of the coolest things we’ve been able to do through COVID because it is furthering our mission of helping folks with food, but at the same time it has a really low contact ration. It’s direct service with low contact.”
While most community members have supported the fridge, Lopez said businesses located near ProjectQ were unhappy with the influx of people experiencing homelessness in the neighborhood. Ultimately, those businesses called local authorities, forcing ProjectQ to move the fridge inside its facilities and making it less accessible, Lopez said. 
“That’s been the hardest thing,” Lopez said, “recognizing that there are systems in place specifically to keep us from having access to the things that we need.”
Before the coronavirus pandemic, the Community Health Involvement Project ran several health sites to provide services such as blood pressure, blood glucose and body mass index screenings to underserved communities in L.A., but cannot operate them for the time being. 
When it’s safe to reopen, the Community Health Involvement Project plans to continue running the health sites and the community fridge. In the future, the organization hopes to start a health site near the community fridge so that people can easily access both health care and food at one location.
“We do still want to keep the fridge up and running,” Kapsner said. “And possibly add other fridges because there used to be two near USC, but one of them recently closed down.”
If students would like to get involved with the community fridge they can reach out to uscchip@gmail.com or DM their instagram page @USCChip.
Correction: A previous version of this story stated that the community fridge is located in Koreatown. It can be found in Chinatown. The Daily Trojan regrets this error.

USC sophomore wide receiver Munir McClain held a press conference Sunday to address his recent suspension from the football team and call for his reinstatement. In the press conference outside Galen Center, McClain, his mother Shanrika “Shan” McClain and social activist Najee Ali read statements and Ali and Shan took questions from the media.
Los Angeles Times USC athletics reporter Ryan Kartje reported Thursday that McClain had been suspended by USC after applying for and receiving Pandemic Unemployment Assistance benefits in connection with his high-end sneaker reselling business. The investigation has reportedly expanded in recent weeks as FBI agents have questioned USC students in relation to the unemployment claims, according to his mother.
McClain’s mother was adamant that USC has not provided the family with a reason for his suspension and said the University has not met with them regarding the issue.
Ali opened the conference by calling for the immediate reinstatement of McClain to the football team, vouching for McClain’s character and calling on the “Trojan family” for their support.
In his statement, McClain confirmed he received PUA benefits but maintained he believes there was nothing wrong with his application. 
“I applied with the help of a representative from EDD, the California Unemployment Department, and believe I did everything right,” McClain said.
McClain said he hopes USC communicates with the attorneys representing him and directed any questions from the media to Ali or his mother.
A few of McClain’s teammates attended the press conference to show support for McClain, including Munir’s brother redshirt sophomore linebacker Abdul-Malik McClain, as well as redshirt senior receiver Tyler Vaughns, freshman offensive linemen Casey Collier and Courtland Ford, redshirt sophomore linebackers Spencer Gilbert and Eli’jah Winston, redshirt freshman cornerback Adonis Otey and freshman defensive lineman Jamar Sekona. 
They did not address the media or answer questions out of respect for USC’s request they not comment.
“The coaches have asked the student-athletes not to speak publicly on this, and we respect that,” Ali said. “The very fact that they’re here with us speaks for itself.” 
Otey, Vaughns and senior tailback Stephen Carr showed support for McClain by posting about the press conference on social media.
“It’s very troubling the FBI are knocking on USC students’ doors,” Ali said. “They [USC] have not met with us, but they’ve found time to meet with the FBI.”
Ali contrasted the financial situations of coaches and players on college football teams amid a pandemic. 
“[Coaches] are multi-millionaires,” Ali said. “Don’t fault struggling students for using the law and resources to get what’s needed to survive.”
Following Ali’s opening statements, Shan called for her son to be reinstated.
“If Munir has done something wrong, please tell him what it is,” she said.
USC provided a statement on the press conference, reaffirming its inability to discuss the ongoing investigation and its obligation to protect student privacy. 
“USC has spoken about this matter with Munir McClain and his mother Shan McClain,” the statement said. “We will not discuss those conversations out of respect for student privacy and due to the pending investigation.” 
The University also said any player who chooses to address the media does so by their own choice. 
“If a player or his family chooses to address the media concerning a matter that is under investigation, that is entirely their decision,” the statement read.

With the start of their seasons approaching less than a month away, the USC men’s and women’s basketball teams held their first media sessions Friday.
For the women’s team, a 17-14 finish with an 8-5 finish to Pac-12 play last season is reason for optimism. The team will bring everyone except graduating senior forward Kayla Overbeck back from last season’s roster. Head coach Mark Trakh’s group is extremely young, with one graduate, no seniors, just one junior, seven sophomores and four freshmen. 
Junior captain and guard Desiree Caldwell has played a key role as a leader so far, Trakh said.
“Desi does a great job keeping our kids motivated [and] staying positive with them all the time,” Trakh said. “She actually is performing very, very well in practice, shooting the ball very well.”
Trakh also highlighted the play of sophomore Alissa Pili, last season’s leading scorer. The 6-foot forward was voted Freshman of the Year in the Pac-12 last year and selected as the third-best in her class in the country by ESPN.
After averaging 16.3 points her first year, Trakh said Pili has the potential to go down as one of the best players to ever play at USC.
“For anybody that’s seen her, they understand she’s a tough matchup,” Trakh said. “She can shoot the threes, she can score inside, she can face the basket and go at the basket.” 
Sophomore guard Endyia Rogers was another player Trakh mentioned as a candidate for a breakout year. Trakh spoke of Rogers in a similar tone as Pili, saying she too can be remembered as “one of the great guards to have played at USC.”
The Trojans finished last season by winning four of their last five games and feel the confidence they built can carry into this year. 
“Last year we learned a lot,” Caldwell said. “The vibe of this season right now this year is that we’re just very hungry.”
The main goals for the Trojans this year are to finish top six in the Pac-12, keep building for the future and make the NCAA Tournament, Trakh said. 
On the other hand, the men’s team is coming off a 22-9 season that saw it finish fourth in the Pac-12. 
The Trojans lost six players from last year’s squad but welcome highly touted and top-ranked freshman forward Evan Mobley to the roster. In addition, Evan’s brother Isaiah, a sophomore forward, will be an important returning piece to the team. 
Head coach Andy Enfield had high praise for the freshman Mobley. 
“Every day it seems like he does something different, whether it’s offensively or defensively, that no one else can do on our team or anybody we played against last year,” Enfield said. “So it’s fun to watch some of those spectacular plays, but he’s a developing player.” 
The Trojans’ practically brand new roster brings new expectations and qualities to the team’s play. 
“We’re excited about our talent level and our roster,” Enfield said. “They have great chemistry and we have a lot of athleticism and size and length, but we just have to go out and prove it.”
Both Mobleys contribute to that length and size of a Trojan team that Enfield described as the biggest ever at USC. Enfield hopes it can make the Trojans versatile on the defensive end of the floor.  
“I think we’ll be very good defensively like we were last year because of our size and length and our toughness,” Enfield said. “But we just have to find a nice consistency offensively and defensively with a group that has never played together.”
That is a key challenge for the men’s team this year. Unlike the women’s team, which has some continuity, Enfield’s group is bringing many new faces into the equation this year: Only seven players return from last year’s roster.
Enfield said the Trojans boast lots of tough players, such as guards sophomore Ethan Anderson and redshirt senior Isaiah White.
White and redshirt seniors Chevez Goodwin and Tahj Eaddy have impressed in training camp so far, Enfield said. A 6-foot-9 forward transfer from Wofford, Goodwin adds size to the Trojans. Eaddy, on the other hand, is a 6-foot-2 guard who transferred from Santa Clara University and brings extra ball handling. 
With the roster as relatively new as it is, Enfield emphasized that everybody on the team is going to have to play minutes. 
The men’s season tips off Nov. 25 against an undecided opponent.
