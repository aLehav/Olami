Robert Hellyer, author and associate professor of history at Wake Forest University, discussed his new book “Green with Milk and Sugar: When Japan Filled America’s Tea Cups” at Doheny Memorial Library Monday. Hellyer’s book navigates a dedicated history to green tea and provides a personal narration of his family’s tea-processing factories.
The event, co-sponsored by USC Libraries, the USC Department of History and green tea company ITO EN North America marks the first in-person talk for the Shinso Ito Center for Japanese Religions and Culture since March 2020. 
Hellyer, whose family shares a personal relationship with tea through their tea processing factories in the Japanese port cities of Shizuoka and Kobe, said his maternal grandmother reserved green tea for guests and coffee for Hellyer because green tea was a sophisticated, elevated beverage. 
“As my grandmother and I sat on lawn chairs savoring the aroma of freshly cut grass, she often talked of her time in Japan in the early 1930s as the wife of a tea merchant,” wrote Hellyer in his book. “Much of what propelled me to write this book was a desire to delve beyond the anecdotes from those summer days and to learn more about the worlds of my grandmothers.”
Tea classifications, Hellyer said, can be discerned by oxidation levels and is categorized as green tea — subcategorized into sencha, bancha and matcha — oolong tea and black tea, the latter the most oxidized of the teas. Hellyer said there is a presupposition that America has no standard tea conduct, but green tea was at the center of it.
“Many American families, particularly young girls, will be encouraged to have a tea set or have tea time, but we don’t have coffee time in the same way,” Hellyer said. “Starbucks has its own nice, everyday elegance, but it’s not the sophistication.”
Tea consumption patterns in the 1850s demonstrated that American consumers and even former United States presidents continued to drink green tea following the Boston Tea Party and the American Revolution, Hellyer said. Sentiment for green tea didn’t wane until the postwar era, when anti-Japanese and anti-Chinese views spawned from propaganda.
“While Britons preferred black teas, after 1800, in the United States, green tea came to hold an aura of sophistication and was more widely consumed,” Hellyer said. “Green tea was sold at higher prices than black tea.”
Indian Ceylon, a competitor to Japan Tea — the first national brand of green tea in the U.S. — sought to sell its black tea to the U.S. market following a successful introduction into British society. Indian Ceylon altered Americans’ tastes from green to black teas with a strategy that involved negative advertising with racist overtones presenting both Japanese and Chinese green teas as “dirty, dangerous and fraudulent,” Hellyer said. 
“These advertisements had some impact in reducing American consumption of Japanese green tea but not immediately,” Hellyer said. “That’s because the war disrupted Indian Ceylon exports, so Japan was able to export more tea to Britain and other European markets.”
In bolstering black tea’s reputation, Indian Ceylon contended that their tea was better quality because it was picked and refined by white individuals, which had long-term impacts on American consumption of Japanese green tea, Hellyer said. 
Rebecca Corbett, co-head of the East Asian Library, associate University librarian and moderator of the event, said that, amid rising anti-Asian hate regarding coronavirus origins, conversations about historical instances of anti-Japanese and anti-Chinese perception that parallel modern trends are crucial to observing positive examples of interaction between North America and Asian countries.  
“A lot of Japanese Americans found it difficult, initially, to live in America and to not have that negative associations because of their heritage,” Corbett said. “We are looking at the economic and cultural history of tea as a product in America … the popularity of it over time and people’s image of Japan and how that can be bound up … in Japan as a branding symbol.”
Lindsay O’ Neill, who attended the lecture with students from her “General Education Seminar in Social Analysis: Drunk History, or How Beverages Changed the World” class, said beverages can tell a significant story about Westward expansion and colonization facilitated by corporations.  
“It’s a smaller way to look at these long term changes,” said O’Neill, an associate professor of history at the Dornsife College of Letters, Arts and Sciences. “Hopefully, it makes people think, and USC students think more critically about what’s on their plate.”
Issay Matsumoto, who asked a question about advertisements’ role of promoting sencha as a “health product” to stimulate export numbers, said he attended the talk because of his intrigue with tea, which stems from his desire to learn about Japanese products’ influence in Asian markets. 
Depending on the geopolitics of the time, tea can be culturally valued or devalued depending on its origin, Matsumoto said. From the experience, Matsumoto drew takeaways about consumption and production patterns across waters from Hellyer’s research and personal anecdotes.
“You can tell histories close to you because the speaker’s own family history is linked to this. So, you can tell stories about your own family in really big, interesting ways,” Matsumoto said.

It was an evening of shock, awe and fierce but friendly competition in Stauffer Science Hall, where calculus aficionados gathered Monday night for a mathematical sparring.
The USC Math Club, with support from the mathematics department, hosted the University’s first ever Integral Bee. Forty-three undergraduate participants competed for cash prizes by solving integrals — operators in calculus commonly conceptualized as the area under a curve.
Ajay Srinivasan, a freshman majoring in mathematics, first came up with the idea to host an Integral Bee at USC after seeing similar events at other universities across the country.
“In high school, I’ve seen the ones at MIT, at Berkeley and around the world,” Srinivasan said. “I was telling my dad over a FaceTime call: ‘If there was one at USC, then I’d participate.’ And he was like, ‘You should make one yourself.’”
Srinivasan reached out to friends he met from a problem-solving course in the fall, and together, they approached the USC Math Club to see if they would host. After weeks of emailing professors, gathering volunteers and sending mission statements to advisors, the event was set to happen. The Math Club announced the event April 5, promising food and monetary prizes.
Integration bees held at other universities, most notably at MIT where the competition was founded in 1981, have gone viral on YouTube. The 2006 Integration Bee at MIT, uploaded in full, amassed almost 2.8 million views; another video of a final round at MIT has more than 5.1 million views. Monday marked the first time that an event of the same format was held at USC.
“I actually watched MIT and everything … [participating is] a dream come true,” said JuAn Lee, a sophomore majoring in mathematics. “It’s super hype that it’s here.”
The event began with seven preliminary rounds, where two random participants from the pool of 43 were called up to the blackboard to solve an integral under a given time limit. The first to write and circle the correct answer won the round; players who lost were not eliminated. Players lost if they submitted two incorrect attempts. 
The eight highest-scoring individuals moved on to the quarterfinals. After that, just four remained: Lee; Stanley Hong, a freshman majoring in economics; Alexander Morgan, a senior majoring in electrical and computer engineering and Frank He, a freshman majoring in mathematics and computer engineering and computer science. Morgan and Hong advanced to the final round.
After an intense and prolonged final round, Hong emerged as the winner of USC’s first Integral Bee, taking home $100. Morgan took second place, Lee third and He fourth.
“I was pretty nervous because one more wrong answer and I [would have been] out,” Hong said. “I’m glad that nothing went wrong … I feel like it was mainly that I got lucky.”
Srinivasan said he is “ambitious” and “optimistic” about hosting another Integral Bee next year.
“I think people at the math department are stoked as well to have a fun recurring event for students,” he said. “An ambitious goal for us is to take this beyond USC to bring in universities around Southern California — so we have Caltech, LMU, Harvey Mudd … The long-term goal is to reach out to them and see if, together, we can set up this fun environment for students to interact with problem solving.”

Los Angeles Superior Court of Justice Judge James C. Chalfant issued a temporary restraining order against pranksters Ernest Kanevsky and Yuguo Bai Friday, prohibiting them from campus entry and all other University-owned properties. The order follows the lawsuit USC filed Wednesday against Kanevsky and Bai, who infiltrated classrooms during live lectures on three separate occasions since Fall 2021.
The court scheduled a hearing for April 28 to determine whether a preliminary injunction should be issued against the defendants, who caused disturbance and fright among students and faculty members while filming prank Youtube videos. If granted, the injunction would stop or mandate action brought by USC against Kanevsky and Bai, neither of whom are affiliated with the University, before a decision to resolve the lawsuit is made. 
USC lawyers urged for the issuance of a temporary restraining order against the duo, court papers filed Thursday show. 
“Simply put, there is no public benefit to terrorizing students to the point where they are running out of lecture halls for fear of their lives through the perpetration of prank classroom takeovers in order to garner a handful of likes on YouTube,” the lawyers stated in the court papers.
The defendants’ most recent prank occurred March 29, when Kanevsky entered a Taper Hall lecture about the Holocaust, pretended to be a member of the “Russian Mafia” and demanded that Bai, who was already there, pay him the $50,000 that his father “owes.” The staged confrontation prompted students to flee the building and resulted in the detainment and later arrest of Kanevsky and Bai by the L.A. Police Department. 
USC’s lawsuit alleges that the pair’s “panic-inducing classroom takeovers” caused irreparable physical and emotional damage to students and professors, financial harm from increased Department of Public Safety visits and emotional support and loss of instructional time, among other detriments. Court papers state that the March 29 disruption led to a “drastic drop in student attendance the next time the class was scheduled to meet in person as (USC’s) students were simply too scared to return to the classroom.”
USC’s Chief Threat Assessment Officer Patrick Prince submitted a sworn declaration in support of the temporary restraining order against Kanevsky and Bai. 
“Given the tragic recurrence of campus violence throughout the country, we are a nation on guard against the very type of mayhem that is an objectively reasonable response to the defendants’ outrageous, selfish, reckless and dangerous actions,” Prince said.
It is not clear whether Kanevsky and Bai have legal representation, the Los Angeles Times reported Monday.

Holding embroidered red baseball caps, hundreds of members of the USC community gathered in front of the Dr. Joseph Medicine Crow Center for International and Public Affairs to celebrate the building’s renaming and namesake Monday afternoon. 
Medicine Crow was the first member of the Apsáalooke (Crow) tribe to earn a master’s degree, which he received from USC in 1939 in anthropology. He would later receive an honorary doctoral degree from the University in 2003. Medicine Crow was also named the Crow tribe’s last war chief for his service in the United States Army’s 103rd Infantry Division in World War II and then worked as a tribal historian for the Apsáalooke (Crow) Nation. In 2009, former President Barack Obama honored Medicine Crow with the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the highest civilian medal of honor, for his military service and contributions to Native American history. 
“By honoring the great scholar warrior Dr. Joseph Medicine Crow, we affirm that, like him, we will fight on for creativity and compassion. We will fight on for justice and dignity. We will fight on for excellence and empowerment,” said Office of Religious Life Dean Varun Soni at the dedication. 
The dedication began with a traditional colors presentation by the Indigenous Warrior Flag Group of Central California, led by Frank Gonzalez, the group’s president. The presentation was followed by speeches from Soni and Board of Trustees chair Rick Caruso, who praised President Carol Folt for her “courage and determination” in renaming the building. 
The renaming came after years of student protests against the building’s former name, the Von KleinSmid Center, after former University president and known eugenicist Rufus von KleinSmid. Hours before Folt’s inauguration in September 2019, a vandalized bust of von KleinSmid was found with a piece of cloth reading “RENAME VKC” in red lettering and a cardboard sign with the word “NAZI” covering the statue. 
“During [my] inauguration, I saw students protesting in front of this building, so of course, I wanted to know why, and I wanted to learn about it,” said Folt at the dedication. 
Folt then brought forward a motion to the Board of Trustees’ executive committee to remove von KleinSmid’s name from the building and worked with them to create the Center for International and Public Affairs Naming Committee, composed of students, staff, faculty and alumni. The committee considered about 200 names, gathered from a survey sent to the University community. 
“We’re just blown away by his story,” said Paula Cannon, co-chair of the naming committee, in an interview with the Daily Trojan. “We found it incredible that most of us hadn’t heard of him, and then we thought, everyone needs to have heard of him. This just seemed like a perfect opportunity to put a name on this building of somebody who was just a really good man.” 
In addition to the renaming of the building, Folt also announced the creation of the Dr. Joseph Medicine Crow Scholarship, a new scholarship program for Native American students that will launch in Fall 2022. 
Following Folt’s speech, Medicine Crow’s son, Ronald Medicine Crow, shared stories about his father and two songs, one sung in his father’s honor and one that belonged to his father himself.  
“It just is overwhelming. We’re so blessed and honored and humbled for all that’s taking place today in Dad’s memory,” he said in an interview with the Daily Trojan. “I’m just his spokesman today … He told me a lot of stories and so forth about tribal history and everything else that takes place in the Crow way of life.” 
Ronald said he hopes students feel “inspired” when they walk into the building.
“I hope they’ll be inspired to do their best and to excel in their studies and get their degrees and go on with their lives and be highly successful,” he said. 
Native American Student Assembly co-founder Maracea Chase, who also spoke at the dedication, said the renaming is “amazing.” 
“The renaming of this building not only exemplifies the amazing accomplishments and character of Dr. Joseph Medicine Crow, but it also serves as a basis for recognition and representation of our Native American students, staff, faculty and alumni,” said Chase at the dedication. “For when there is recognition and representation, there is understanding.” 
Chase also said the building will serve as “a space for Native American students to thrive and grow in an environment that celebrates who we are as a collective.” 
“This building is the foundation that will inspire and comfort students, knowing there is a place for them to excel and achieve beyond their wildest imaginations,” Chase said. “From here, we shall embody the confidence to grow, thrive, to succeed, to fail, to live, to exist fully and wholeheartedly as we are.” 
Chase said speaking at the dedication was “an incredible honor.” 
“It truly does mean a lot for the Native American community here at USC but also all around Los Angeles, just knowing that there is representation here and that there is a home for our students and for our children to go out and pursue a higher education, which is what we’ve been trying to do over the past few decades,” she said in an interview with the Daily Trojan. 
The program then featured a presentation of a custom-made rudis from the Trojan Battalion ROTC, a bound copy of Medicine Crow’s original thesis and a live painting of the event to Medicine Crow’s family, as well as a reading by Medicine Crow’s granddaughter. The dedication concluded with a formal unveiling of the building’s new name, which included the release of cardinal and gold streamers and the unrolling of a large printed banner, accompanied by the Trojan Marching Band. 
Folt said she hopes to continue uplifting the voices and names of people who, like Medicine Crow, are relatively unknown currently, and that she’s “really glad” that the dedication wasn’t done while the University operated remotely during the coronavirus pandemic
“We can’t diminish who von KleinSmid was. We can’t pretend. We don’t hide him. But we have something much more to celebrate, and I think that’s this,” said Folt in an interview with the Daily Trojan. “We worked hard to get here. We had to do a lot of other things at the same time, but this is the right thing, so in some ways, it’s good to be able to be a part of the right thing with the people that care about it.”

Spring has sprung and so have a brand new crop of art openings throughout Los Angeles. From Midcity to the Arts District, these openings offer new works across all types of media, spanning painting to screen printing to stained glass sculpture.
A gallery can be a perfect excuse to get out or can even be a quick addition to spice up a date night. Here are some of the most exciting highlights from the L.A. art scene to see this April.
“Love You” – Cara Benedetto at Night Gallery
(April 2 – May 7)
Anyone familiar with stan culture will recognize the terrors of internet virality explored in Cara Benedetto’s “Love You.” Social media fan culture stands at the forefront of the show, a series of mixed media works that satirize, honor and unpack the parasocial relationship between celebrities and their deadly droves of loving fans. Benedetto’s favorite celebrities, including Mariah Carey, Angelina Jolie and “Euphoria”’s Zendaya and Hunter Schafer, are featured as blurred, uncanny versions of themselves in her pieces. 
These weird distorted figures, created utilizing canvas prints copied several times over and outlined with oil paint, recall the impossibly faultless version of celebrities built up by their fans only to be expediently destroyed at the earliest sign of a human flaw. Combining image and text to evoke Instagram captions or advertising copy, Benedetto’s work plays like a horror comedy poking fun at the dystopian nature of the public’s relationship with our icons. It is a relationship poisoned by the toxic and deafening echo chamber of the internet.
“The Understudies” — Em Kettner at François Ghebaly
(April 2 – May 7)
In her sophomore exhibition at François Ghebaly, Em Kettner finds inspiration in the most unlikely of subjects: snails. At first glance, the undeniable quirk of Kettner’s “The Understudies” may lead one to write the works off as trivial, or even worse, “cute.” However, beneath each piece’s quaint veneer lies an absurdist comedy pondering the violence of observation.
Kettner stages images featuring eager-eyed doctors subjecting snails to surgery before an audience of spectators on the surface of miniscule 2 by 2 inch ceramic tiles. As with most art pieces, these works are best experienced in-person. Pictures hardly do the tiny sketches justice, as the miniscule size of each tile forces the viewer to lean in and create an intimacy with the vignettes they observe. 
Within each scene, the theatrical operations taking place question the roles that society forces the viewer to portray during everyday life as performer and audience member. Especially on social media, everyone becomes the snail melting under scalding spotlights, the doctor subjecting it to such invasive attention or the audience simply sitting back and enjoying the struggle. 
“Magic, Mystery & Legerdemain” — Derek Fordjour at David Kordansky 
(March 26 – May 7)
To enter Derek Fordjour’s brilliant “Magic, Mystery & Legerdemain” is to come under the illusionary influence of a magic show. Magic informs Fourdjour’s work as a prism through which to look at Black diasporic relationships with the past. 
The routine of a magic trick echoes the repetition of Black cultural traditions throughout history, depicted in the installation and sculptural collage pieces through images of jazz performance, cotillions and Carnival parades. Newspaper appears as a motif in the show, both materially and as a metaphor for history itself. It is spliced, painted and reconfigured into the paintings’ figures suggesting that identity is constructed from our ancestors and the cultural histories that precede us. 
Don’t forget to catch the live magic performance by Kenrick “ICE” McDonald repeating daily at 2 p.m., Tuesdays through Saturdays, in the gallery space until the culmination of the show on May 7th.
“Recent Sculpture” — Group Show at Matthew Brown Los Angeles (April 2 – May 7)
Matthew Brown LA’s “Recent Sculpture” presents 12 provocative works which represent exciting developments in the world of contemporary sculpture. Canadian artist Fin Simonetti contributes a highlight of the show through “Gusset 5,” a menacing yet delicate stained glass bear trap cast in baby blues and dark amber. One of the most enjoyable aspects of the show comes from its variety of material and expression. In stark contrast to the grim glitter of “Gusset 5” are Patricia Ayres’ sculptures, two towering columns of stained pantyhose, recalling disembodied sections of the human form bound by constricting straps of elastic. The works of “Recent Sculpture” span from humorous to haunting, all that must be seen to be truly understood.
“West Coast Paintings” — Melissa Brown at Anat Ebgi Gallery (April 2 – May 7)
In her first L.A. solo exhibition, Melissa Brown portrays the world’s current state as a bad acid trip, a perspective many agree with. Wildfires, wind turbines and iPhones are painted in psychedelic gradients of millennial pink and acid green. Yet, beneath the surface of the works’ vibrant colors wails a pain seen only during the show’s more abstract moments. 
In “Huntington Portal,” an unique coral-like skeleton stands in a surreal, tiffany blue garden. However, upon closer inspection, a distraught, miserable face appears in this sculpture’s negative space, mouth agape almost in the midst of a scream. Brown combines screen printing, airbrush and oil paints to present this vision of the West Coast that, through its disturbed detachment from reality, hits a little too close to home.

It’s been two years since Fivio Foreign released his last album, “800 BC,” a small compilation of songs such as “Big Drip” and “Wetty,” which shot him into mainstream hip-hop. Since the death of Brooklyn drill superstar Pop Smoke, many have touted Fivio as the style’s heir.
A good portion of the album contains Fivio’s classic components — heavy-hitting, vicious lyrics over a variety of bass-heavy beats. He also follows a big UK trend in drill, a style of rap music, sampling popular songs and rapping over them. However, he tries his hand at introducing features that lean closer toward the R&B genre to add an unique  ballad-like aspect to some songs such as “Hello” and “Love Songs.” 
The Brooklyn native released a mini-documentary two days prior to the release of “B.I.B.L.E.,” giving a more personal, in-depth look into the rapper’s life than what was previously known about him. Fivio mentions the influence of faith on his life, why he chose to create some of the tracks in the album and his motives for leaving his previous lifestyle.
The album also features big profile artists such as Kanye West, Alicia Keys and A$AP Rocky. Some of these features go out of their way and try their hand at the drill style, rapping violently over a harsh beat — familiar markers of the subgenre. 
While Fivio is known for his drill style rapping, he’s incorporated a bit of pop rap in an attempt to grow outside of New York and gain a larger following. There are some tracks in the album that have an unique  gospel-like feeling, resembling songs in Kanye’s album “Donda.” 
And it’s quite easy to identify the influence that Kanye has on the album, with a similar style added to songs like “On God,” “Changed on Me” and “Through the Fire,” with the first two songs using KayCyy and Vory, artists heavily featured on “Donda.” Fivio and Kanye, the executive producer for the album, began collaborating when creating “Off the Grid” for “Donda,” which brought a positive reception from both fanbases. 
However, Fivio’s penmanship serves as one of the main points of interest of the album. The development in Fivio’s rapping is also noticeable. His previous works like “Big Drip” showcased bars full of short and heavy bursts of energy. While addictive and a breath of fresh air, it was noticeable that the style only suited drill beats. In “B.I.B.L.E.,” his verses are full and have more intent than just revolving around sex, drugs and money. He’s created bodies of work to talk about the street life of Brooklyn.
Following his growth are the variety of beats he uses throughout the project. AXL Beats, a London-based producer known for his drill instrumentals and an influential figure in the Brooklyn drill movement, produced many of his older pieces.
But West’s best use of a sample is one he’s previously flipped: “Through the Fire” by Chaka Khan. Fivio decides to use the same name for the track and features Quavo delivering a verse. This track is arguably the most appealing of the album, as the sample provides a pop feeling, though there is a clear drill presence in the song. It allows Fivio to enter his pocket easily and flow with it while evolving the drill style and supplying something fresh for listeners at the same time. 
To close off the album, Fivio leaves a heartfelt message to help fans understand where he comes from and how he feels about life in “Can’t Be Us.” The song is more mellow than much of his discography and it’s clear that he’s put a lot of time and thought into this track. It uses a lot of hi-hats throughout to give it a rhythm consistent with Fivio’s flow, while the crooning instrumental gives it an emotional feel to it. He talks about the misfortunes that come with street life and the struggle of losing loved ones. He thanks God for giving him a route to escape this dangerous lifestyle and handing him a second opportunity after being arrested last year. 
Overall, “B.I.B.L.E.” is a solid and impressive album from the face of drill. While creating these drill bangers may please his core fanbase, songs with deeper meaning and Fivio’s willingness to attempt something entirely different allows him to be more than just a drill rapper. This album proves that he’s not a static artist. Fivio’s versatility and openness makes this album one to remember.

Three years ago, Camille Lasker and Jenna Grossbart were making small batches of dairy-free ice cream out of a hotel kitchen that lent them their ice cream machine. Now their product, Holi Scoops, can be found on shelves across the nation in Sprouts, Erewhon and Farmshop, Calif. 
Lasker, a Los Angeles-native and alumna from the Marshall School of Business, struggled with health issues her entire life. After living with digestion and autoimmunity issues and thyroid cancer, she soon altered her lifestyle, including her approach to food. A dessert fanatic, Lasker found it challenging to find alternative options that still satisfied her sweet tooth. 
“[The dessert space] was really tough for me,” Lasker said. “I’ve always tried to look for healthy alternatives that feel good, so I decided to try to create something better.”
Once Lasker connected with Grossbart, a holistic nutritionist and food/brand consultant, they set out to create a dairy-free, keto-friendly ice cream with no sugar added. Their biggest goal? “To not sacrifice the indulgence piece,” Lasker said.
It was from this dream that Holi Scoops was born. Holi Scoops, short for Holistic Scoops, is a frozen plant-based, dairy-free and keto-friendly dessert company. It contains no added sugar with four grams of sugar coming only from date syrup. The pints are  additionally adaptogenic, infused with mood-boosting plants. 
Early on, Lasker knew she wanted to start a company, going on to UCLA to earn an MBA after graduating from USC. She worked on a mobile app startup and, from there, went between startups to gain experience.
Despite Grossbart’s nutritionist expertise and Lasker’s business background, the process for finding the right ice cream formula took two to three years. The most difficult part was the formulation of the product, Lasker said. 
“When you take out traditional ingredients like dairy and sugar out of ice cream, you’re left with a scientific mess,” Lasker said. 
After years of tweaking the recipe, switching up measurements and flavors to get the right consistency and taste while hitting their nutritional goals, the duo then experienced other obstacles, including packaging and manufacturing. 
The biggest challenge with a capital-based startup is having the means to afford capital, particularly something that needs a well-packaged product. The two received several grants from UCLA to get the packaging done and to launch their final product.
“This product is really capital-intensive, so trying to get this product off the ground was really challenging,” Grossbart said. 
With their product now on shelves nationwide, branding has been essential to their success. The duo reached out to agencies across the world and “loved” an art agency out of Mexico. They helped create Holi Scoop’s signature artwork and packaging, defined by the imagery of a woman depicted in fun colors, patterns and fonts. 
“We kind of want her to communicate a sense of bliss and euphoria, just as if she’s just tried something delicious, but is at peace and calm,” Lasker said.
The tedious days of making small batches in a local hotel are long gone. Holi Scoops now works with one of the largest manufacturers in the United States. They produce up to 50,000 pints per batch to provide products to stores across the country. 
“We’re really also trying to tell a story about the connection between mind and body … just to be able to tell a positive mental health story simultaneously,” Grossbart said. 
Although the team is currently small, mainly consisting of Lasker and Grossbart, a group of interns also helps make Holi Scoops successful.
Charlie Siegel, a sophomore majoring in public relations, currently interns for Holi Scoops. After seeing the pints in Erewhon, he researched the company and saw their job listing looking for an intern. Just recently, Siegel helped with a promotional photoshoot for their Instagram.
“During this internship, I have had an opportunity to do a lot of real public relations work, from artwork to photoshoots to social media management,” Siegel said. 
The company expects to go from stocking product at 100 stores to 400 by June. Lasker and Grossbart said they hope to make new flavors, create fun mini-sizes, explore novelties like popsicles and reach a wider audience through stores such as Target and Costco. 
“I’m happy that I didn’t know how hard it would be when I started,” Lasker said. “I might not have taken the leap but I’m so happy I did … Why not fail and try and have experienced it rather than regret not trying at all?”

The United States Women’s National Team is the standard in the world of soccer — women’s and men’s. 
They’ve won half of the FIFA World Cups ever played, four of seven possible Olympic gold medals and never fallen below No. 2 in the official FIFA world rankings.
The U.S. talent pool is fed by products of the NCAA women’s soccer system, home of the best young prospects in the sport. 
So why hasn’t a program like USC — winners of as many or more national titles than all but four schools in the country — left a proportionate mark on the legacy of the USWNT? More importantly, who is set to make that breakthrough?
The answer is Simone Jackson, and before I launch into that explanation, I would like to acknowledge the one exception to the above statement: Amy Rodriguez. 
Rodriguez is a legend and should be regarded as nothing less at USC and professionally. She won the Trojans their first national title and went on to bring home two Olympic golds and a World Cup. 
Rodriguez’s impact on the women’s professional soccer scene in the U.S. cannot be overstated. She helped bridge the gap between folding and emerging women’s professional leagues, all while continuing to move the game forward.
But after A-Rod, there’s a void. — a void much too large for a program as successful as USC’s. 
Enter Simone Jackson. ­— the fourth-ranked recruit in the class of 2021 and already an All-Pac-12 honoree; she can do it all. 
Jackson is an incredible athlete; her speed down the wings is often too much for college fullbacks to handle. Even when she fought for minutes early in the season, her burst on the counter was impossible to ignore. 
As the opportunities and the minutes came, we got to see the rest of the repertoire. With senior forward Penelope Hocking sidelined with an injury, Jackson stepped up to shoulder the creative burden. 
Carrying the ball forward herself, combining with senior midfielder Croix Bethune and using that elite quickness, she kept the scoreboard ticking for the Trojans in the absence of theirall-time leading goalscorer. 
Then, with more and more touches came more opportunities in big moments to prove just how much attacking brilliance Jackson possesses. 
Down 2 goals at the half in a must-win match against Stanford, Jackson scored and assisted in a second-half comeback that resulted in a 3-2 overtime win. 
Trailing 2-1 in the dying minutes of their second round matchup with Penn State, Jackson scored a screamer from outside the box to keep the Trojans’ season alive. 
In the semifinals of the U-20 Concacaf Championship, with a spot in the U-20 World Cup on the line, Jackson only went and netted the fastest hat trick in the history of the competition. 
Jackson is skilled with the ball at her feet, too athletic to ignore off the ball, a lethal finisher and — most of all — at her best when the moment demands it the most. 
The USWNT is the hardest eleven to crack on the planet, but it’s time this USC program found its way in with more regularity. And, for that, look no further than Simone Jackson.

Coming off two shutout wins last week, No. 18 USC women’s tennis continued its strong play at Marks Stadium and collected two more wins in Sunday’s doubleheader againstNo. 32 Oregon and No. 72 Cal Poly. 
The Trojans have kept their foot on the pedal during this homestand and have now won six in a row to improve their overall record to 16-10. Redshirt freshman McKenna Koenig said the team remains a tight-knit group during the win streak.
“It goes beyond tennis itself,” said Koenig in an interview with the Daily Trojan. “We spend a lot of time with each other. We have really good relationships with each other, and I think that’s what sets us apart from other schools and teams.” 
USC first kicked things off against Oregon Sunday morning. Although the Ducks came into the match after a loss against UCLA, the team was on a six-match win streak of its own prior to that loss. 
The Trojans got on the board first and secured the doubles point in the rubber match. No. 115 sophomore Naomi Cheong and freshman Grace Piper set the tone after defeating Oregon’s duo of junior Allison Mulville and sophomore Myah Petchey 6-1. 
Things would soon get tight on the two other courts as both matches tied at 5-5 at one point. USC’s duo of senior Danielle Willson and redshirt No. 82 freshman Snow Han secured the doubles point with their 7-5 victory over sophomore Ares Teixido Garcia and freshman Karin Young.
The Trojans’ momentum then carried onto the singles matches as Han defeated Teixido Garcia 6-3, 6-3 to put USC up two. Then, within a matter of minutes, Piper beat Young 6-1, 6-2 and Cheong closed the show with a 6-2, 6-4 win over sophomore Uxia Martinez Moral to secure a third straight 4-0 victory for USC. 
USC’s win against Oregon, especially crucial for the postseason, kept the team in fourth place in the Pac-12 standings. The top five teams all have first-round byes in thePac-12 tournament later this month. 
The Trojans would then secure a 4-2 victory in the second leg of their doubleheader against Cal Poly four hours later. The battle for the doubles point went down to the wire on court two as Willson and Han battled toe-to-toe with the Mustangs duo of redshirt sophomores Delanie Dunkle and Melissa Lamette. The Trojans ultimately lost early 7-6(3). 
In singles matches, freshman Leyden Games tied things up for the Trojans after her 6-2, 6-1 victory over freshman Peyton Dunkle. Han followed up by defeating Cal Poly’s Laura Bente 6-0, 6-4 to simultaneously collect her 30th singles victory of the season and give the Trojans a 2-1 lead. 
No. 42 senior Salma Ewing would then score a 6-2, 6-4 win over redshirt junior Kim Bhunu to make the score 3-1 in favor of the Trojans. Match point came on court four courtesy of Koenig’s 6-3, 3-6, 6-3 win over Mustangs redshirt junior Emily Ackerman. 
Koenig gave credit to her teammates for having trust in her during the game-clinching match. 
“I did have a lot of pressure winning those last few points,” she said. “But I just knew that my teammates had full capability and knew that I was going to just push and compete as hard as I did.”
USC’s current six-match win streak is a new season-high for the team, which Koenig said added confidence going into postseason play.
“With the Pac-12 coming up, we just want to have a really good winning streak so we can go into that tournament really confident,” Koenig said. “That’s what’s really motivating us to do better.”
The Trojans will now have a few days off before Friday when they close the season against No. 16 UCLA, who are first in league standings and undefeated in Pac-12 play. 
“Not only is this just a huge rivalry match, but I just know [UCLA is] a great team,” Koenig said. “They have a lot of good players too, so we know that it’s going to be really close.”

I find it nearly impossible to start my day without some type of caffeine. As I’m rushing to class, I gulp my Starbucks grande Cold Brew Coffee and plan out how I will tackle my to-do list. Rather than getting enough sleep or eating a healthy breakfast, I rely on the power of coffee to survive the constant barrage of deadlines.
Most of us compensate for missing hours of sleep with some form of caffeine. The average American consumes 135 mg of caffeine each day, which is equivalent to 1.5 cups of coffee. At the same time, Americans on average sleep 6.8 hours a night, lower than the recommended minimum of seven hours. We’ve found a way to swap our much needed sleep for a shot of energy in the morning.
In a capitalist system, we are valuable only when we’re working and making money. As a result, we do everything in our power to maximize our productive hours. Since sleeping and eating take time out of our day that could be spent working, we replace them with caffeine and fast food.
When our every moment is commodified, it’s nearly impossible to find time to look after ourselves, from eating dinner with our loved ones to getting enough sleep. Capitalism convinces us to compromise our health and happiness to maximize our working potential. 
In the long term, these habits negatively impact our lifespan and quality of life. Eating healthy foods decreases the likelihood of chronic illnesses, including diabetes, heart disease or cancer, by 29-52%. Similarly, sleeping for 5-7 hours a night increases the risk of early death by 12%.
We may believe that swapping sleep for an energy drink buys us a few hours of productivity, but in reality, poor health habits shave years off our lives. Though the system expects workers to prioritize their jobs, finding ways to reject this mindset by caring for ourselves gives us more time to do what we love.
In some twisted way, the market has attempted to solve problems that it itself created. Workers have started to recognize that living for the job only brings them closer to death. The up-and-coming wellness industry has taken advantage of this movement by creating a variety of products intended to promote self-care.
In 2020 alone, the healthy eating, nutrition and weight loss industry brought in $946 billion. From Green Chef’s meal prep kits to Beam’s dream powder, corporations promise to manufacture healthy habits in a laboratory.
Regardless of how corporations market these products, the system cannot save us from itself. Meal prep kits and supplements may give us a few extra hours a week, they attempt to solve a symptom of a much larger problem.
Though these corporate health schemes streamline the process of meeting our body’s physical needs, they only worsen our attachment to productivity. Rather than forcing necessary lifestyle changes, they feed into our need for efficiency.
Instead of building a healthy work life balance, we use these supplements and replacements to spend as little time as possible away from work. Real change comes from restructuring our workplaces to view workers as humans as opposed to productivity machines. We need to create an economic structure in which self-care is no longer an inconvenience but rather a necessity.
Healthy lifestyle practices are not something that we can buy or check off a list. These practices extend beyond specific nutritional guidelines and include nurturing your social circle and prioritizing your happiness. There is no product on the market that can create connections and offer long-lasting happiness. 
Food is one of the many ways we achieve these goals. While eating is a physical necessity, it also serves as a way to strengthen our relationships over moments of indulgence and laughter.
Meal prep kits may offer the most efficient way to give your body nutrients, but it’s the moments we spend dancing in the kitchen and laughing over family dinners that bring us joy and happiness.
Taking an extra hour out of my day to make my Grandma’s special pulao may not be as efficient as following a Green Chef recipe, but it gives me the opportunity to remember those who have come before me and connect with those around me. I would argue that is significantly more important than squeezing in an extra homework problem.

In 1971, Ray Tomlinson sent what is considered the very first email. He worked for what is now BBN Technologies and fiddled around with the company’s network, the Advanced Research Projects Agency Network, an early predecessor to the Internet. When asked what exactly he wrote in that first message, Tomlinson quipped, “The first email is completely forgettable. And, therefore, forgotten.”
There lies the very nature of email itself: It’s forgettable. As primitive as technology from the 1970s seems now, computer users had actually been sending messages to each other for years. Even at its birth, email was old news. Why then is this accidental, ever-obsolete invention still eating up so much of our time?
Post-2020, workers everywhere have become more willing — or, perhaps, pressured — to respond to any and all inquiries at any time of day. 
According to a study conducted by Microsoft, about more than half of 30,000 participating employees feel overworked, exhausted and/or burnt out. Gene Marks from The Guardian writes, “Thanks to these new working from home arrangements, meetings are significantly longer, ‘chats’ have risen 45% and 41 [million] more emails were sent in one month alone (February 2021) compared with the same month last year.”
This can largely be attributed to companies’ unfamiliarity with working outside the parameters of a typical office and employees’ inability to disconnect. We’re working from home after all and probably wearing comfy pants, so what’s the excuse? Is it really so hard to just respond now? 
Being able to contact anyone, anytime, with an air of professional urgency makes it increasingly difficult to disengage, to draw a line between self and employee. If we feel as though we’ve gotten ourselves lodged within the hamster wheel of American capitalism, it’s because we have.
To dislodge ourselves, we must first acknowledge the negative toll our toxic relationship with email has on our lives. First, loitering in our inboxes wastes an average of 21 minutes every day. Full-time working professionals check their email every few minutes, lured by the siren’s call of push notifications. The solution is to schedule specific times to check our email and turn off push notifications.
Next on the chopping block is full inboxes.
They waste an additional 27 minutes per day. We have relatively little control over our eyes; they like to read whatever’s in front of them, and if that means glancing over the same Chamberlain’s Coffee giveaway for the sixth time in half an hour, that is just what they’ll do. The solution is to archive, delete or respond to every email the first time we read them. Hold for Type-A audience applause.
Lastly, but never the least, is junk mail, the bane of existing in the 21st-century. It costs us eight minutes every day to read and process these virtual pieces of recycling, and what do we get out of it, 20% off one-ply toilet paper at Walgreens? The solution is to unsubscribe and block every irrelevant bulletin, newsletter and sales subscription we probably don’t remember signing up for in the first place. 
With the rise and fall of related forms of communication — AOL, Myspace, Facebook pokes — it’s natural enough to assume email may someday suffer a similar fate. Currently, however, there are more than three billion registered email addresses, and millennials and Gen Z are using them with record-breaking frequency, with the former group spending an average of six hours a day checking their inboxes.
The foreseeable future is letting email tag along. We may as well figure out a less miserable way to use it.
