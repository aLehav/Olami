The USC women’s basketball team closed out the regular season over the weekend, snapping an eight-game losing streak with a 74-62 win over Arizona on Friday and a 67-60 win over Arizona State on Sunday.
With 13 points and six rebounds, senior forward Christina Marinacci led the Women of Troy in her final regular season game, while junior forward Cassie Harberts added 12 points and 10 rebounds. The double-double was Harberts’ 10th of the season and 16th of her career. Sophomore guards Ariya Crook and Kiki Alofaituli added 13 and 11 points, respectively.
Senior forward Janae Fulcher finished with 17 points and 13 rebounds for Arizona State (13-17, 5-13 Pac-12), while sophomore guard Promise Amukumara added 10 points and five rebounds.
USC (10-19, 7-11 Pac-12) led    34-23 at the half behind the combined efforts of Marinacci (seven points, four rebounds), junior forward Desiree Bradley (six points), Alofaituli (five points, three rebounds) and Harberts (four points, five rebounds). The Women of Troy shot 48 percent from the field compared to ASU’s 28 percent, including four-of-eight from 3-point range. ASU, on the other hand, was just one-of-nine. Fulcher led the Sun Devils with 10 points and five rebounds at the half.
“It was weird playing in my last conference game,” Marinacci said. “I don’t think the season is over for us at all. Anything can happen in the Pac-12 tournament.”
After both teams knocked down a 3-pointer to start the game, the Women of Troy held the lead throughout the first half, up by as many as 13 with 3:12 left in the half.
USC came out in the second half hoping to avoid a repeat of their previous game against ASU, where they were up by 16 at the half and wound up losing by seven.
The Sun Devils, however, came ready to repeat that performance, breaking open what was an even matchup on the boards at the half (17-17) and out-rebounding USC 40-31, including 20 to six on the offensive boards.
ASU would cut the lead to four with eight minutes left, but a pair of layups from Harberts and sophomore forward Alexyz Vaioletama, as well as eight free throws from Crook in the last 1:32, helped hold off another ASU comeback. USC finished shooting 42 percent from the field as well as 25-of-31 from the free-throw line.
Harberts and Marinacci both racked up double-doubles to lead the Women of Troy against the Wildcats (12-16, 4-13 Pac-12) on Friday. Harberts finished with 23 points and 11 rebounds for her 15th career double-double and ninth this season, while Marinacci finished with 16 points and a career-high 18 rebounds for her seventh career double-double and second of the season.
Junior forward Erica Barnes led the Wildcats with 15 points, while junior guard Carissa Crutchfield and senior guard Davellyn Whyte added 13 points each.
Arizona started off the game with a pair of 3-pointers, jumping out to an early lead. USC then went on a 21-3 run in eight minutes, taking a 23-9 lead and holding the Wildcats to only one basket until Whyte’s 3-pointer made it a 23-12 game.
The Wildcats would cut the lead to as little as eight in the first half, but USC would rally back to take a 39-26 lead at halftime. Marinacci grabbed 11 rebounds in the first half to help USC control the boards by a 29-13 ratio, while freshman guard Brianna Barrett had seven assists.
The Wildcats came out in the second half looking for a win, cutting USC’s lead to five in the first six minutes of the second half. After a 3-pointer by Vaioletama stretched the lead to 10, Arizona would hit three triples to cut the lead to a single point with nine minutes left. A three from Crook and a pair of threes from Desiree Bradley, however, gave USC a 69-58 advantage with four minutes left and secured the win.
“We had three [or] four people in double figures the past two games,” Harberts said. “We were sharing the ball a lot more and we were hitting more shots. I think we really needed these two wins on the road. It’s really important to keep this momentum and keep it rolling.”
Marinacci, meanwhile, felt the same way.
“These two games were probably the two most important games of the Pac-12 conference,” Marinacci added.
The Women of Troy will compete in the Pac-12 championships in Seattle from Thursday, March 7, to Sunday, March 10.

As an outgoing senior, I’m often overcome by nostalgia these days. In the next two months, I will experience a bevy of “lasts” at USC — my last bike ride down Trousdale Parkway in the wholly unnecessary bike lanes, my last chicken-chipotle panini at Popovich Cafe and my last signature on a Monday 9 a.m. discussion-session attendance sheet.
Perhaps for this reason, senior days for USC sports teams have started to resonate with me deeply. Witnessing senior quarterback Matt Barkley walk down the Coliseum tunnel for the last time with his arm in a sling was indescribably saddening. I cringed after watching senior point guard Jio Fontan end his career at the Galen Center by fouling out with five minutes remaining in Saturday’s 57-56 victory over Arizona State.
These parting images of captains, who did their best to will their teams to victory before ultimately falling short of expectations, will stick with me.
In recognition of his players’ perseverance through lean times, USC men’s basketball interim head coach Bob Cantu fielded five seniors to start Saturday’s senior day game: guards Fontan and Tyler Sugiyama, forwards Aaron Fuller and Eric Wise and center James Blasczyk. What made this gesture somewhat perplexing, however, was that Cantu failed to find any playing time for his sixth senior, forward Renaldo Woolridge. In fact, Cantu’s decision to start Sugiyama, a walk-on, furthered magnified Woolridge’s absence from the game.
After the contest, Blasczyk spoke up for his teammate, venting his frustrations via Twitter: “Very disrespectful that my boy [Woolridge] didn’t get out into the game..no class.”
But the 7-footer from Friendswood, Texas, didn’t leave it that. When asked whether he’s considering USC for graduate school and requesting a medical hardship waiver that would grant him another year of eligibility, Blasczyk tweeted, “Depends on who the coach is. If it’s somebody I can respect and play for then absolutely.”
I think it’s safe to read between the lines here and surmise that Blasczyk doesn’t think highly of his new coach.
But with all due respect to Blasczyk, who played valiantly through a foot sprain last season when the roster was decimated by injury, this reeks of sour grapes from a player who hasn’t left the bench in five of the 12 games Cantu has coached.
Whichever way you slice it, such flagrant insubordination by a player is completely unacceptable. Though Cantu might have made an error in judgment by not finding any playing time for Woolridge — especially when the team led by 19 in the first half — that supposed slight didn’t warrant this type of public response when it could have been handled in-house.
Moreover, Division I men’s basketball is not T-ball; it’s a meritocracy where the best players must play. Woolridge has averaged one point per game on 25.9 percent shooting for the season. For his part, Blasczyk has averaged a mere 4.2 points per game in his 12 career starts at USC. At this juncture, neither player provides the Trojans with the best chance to win, and it’s hard to make an argument otherwise.
If you factor in USC’s emergence as a dark-horse team to pull off an upset or two at the Pac-12 tournament, then Blasczyk’s decision to stir the pot is a surprisingly selfish act from a player who has carved out his niche this season as a sparkplug off the bench who relentlessly battles for position down low and snares rebounds. Winner of six of its last eight games, the men’s basketball team is certifiably dangerous as it approaches the mid-March Pac-12 tournament in Las Vegas. After all of the travails, the last thing this team and fan base needs is a divided locker room.
Of course, Cantu could quite easily overlook Blasczyk’s defiance, recognizing that he only has to coach the disgruntled senior for a few more weeks and that it might be best not to inflame the situation. But if the interim coach truly wishes to remove the “interim” label from his title, Cantu must assert his command and reprimand Blasczyk. Cantu can’t let his players openly undermine his leadership and character.
Though Blasczyk’s basketball career at USC surely didn’t end as he had hoped, he must understand that these parting shots accomplish nothing. His time at USC might not have netted him professional prospects, but at least he will soon possess a great degree — one that did not cost him a cent.
To leave behind a legacy of which he can be proud, Blasczyk needs to apologize and do whatever he can to help USC continue its remarkable turnaround.

Just a reminder to the author.  All players are not scorers some are defensive players and USC almost lost the game due to a lack of defense!  The coaches actions were truly rude.  I wish they’d lost to prove the point.  Defense is as important as offense – a team needs both.  They played sloppy basketball, they’re only saving grace was that ASU was sloppier.

For a weekend that started off so promising, it sure didn’t end that way.
The USC baseball team was blown out by Fresno State on Sunday afternoon in Fresno. The Bulldogs put up five in the first inning, one in the second, two in the third and six in the fifth en route to a 14-3 beat down.
Pitching woes · The USC pitching staff gave up a combined 19 runs between Saturday and Sunday’s losses to the Fresno State Bulldogs. – Austin Vogel | Daily Trojan
Freshman pitcher Kyle Twomey, who tossed a complete game a week ago against Cal State Northridge, couldn’t even get out of the first inning. Twomey went 2/3 of an inning and gave up five runs on five hits and three walks, ballooning his season ERA from 2.93 to 5.62.
“As talented as Kyle (Twomey) is, he’s young,” Hubbs said. “I can’t expect him to go out there and throw great every time. He wasn’t consistent today. None of the first few guys we threw were.”
The lone bright spot might be that some of the younger players got to see in-game action. Twenty players took the field on Sunday, including 15 position players.
“I told the guys to take it as a learning experience,” Hubbs said. “They showed us today how to be relentless offensively, how to never let a team back into the game. We can learn from that.”
As if the score wasn’t bad enough, sophomore catcher Garrett Stubbs was knocked out of the game in the first inning after a collision at home plate with Fresno State star Aaron Judge.
In fact, USC was pretty banged up all weekend. In addition to Stubbs, senior second baseman Adam Landecker tweaked his hamstring on Friday and didn’t play the rest of the weekend. Senior outfielder Greg Zebrack missed Saturday’s game with the flu, and sophomore infielder Dante Flores didn’t play all weekend with a wrist issue.
Compounding all of that, usual Saturday starter Wyatt Strahan was scratched Saturday morning, putting sophomore Nigel Nootbaar in the role of spot starter. Nootbaar struggled in the first inning but managed to escape with just one run on the board. After that, he dominated for the better part of the next six innings, striking out 12 and retiring 11 straight Bulldog hitters from the middle of the third all the way through the seventh inning.
Nootbaar, however, was outshined by Fresno State starter Derick Velazquez, who tossed a complete game. Though Nootbaar pitched similarly well for most of his start, he began to unravel in the seventh. After allowing the first four hitters to reach base, Nootbaar was replaced by freshman Shane Gonzales. Thrust into a bases-loaded, no-out situation with one run already in, Gonzales did a good job of keeping the damage to a minimum, allowing just two additional runs to score.
USC actually outhit Fresno State 7-6 on Saturday.  But while the Bulldogs strung their hits together, the Trojans had their hits spread throughout the game, never getting more than two hits in an inning and falling 5-1.
“They pitch you differently in those situations and we have to adjust, Hubbs said.
On Friday, USC gave the impression the weekend would go very differently. The Trojans knocked a season-high 14 hits and put up nine runs en route to a 9-1 blowout. Junior starting pitcher Bobby Wheatley tossed seven stellar shutout innings, allowing six hits and walking just one.

Beginning Monday, USC will take part in the second annual  national student-led movement and discussion about education reform.
Undergraduate Student Government’s Program Board’s EdMonth, which will take place March 4-15, will serve as a national discussion between students, educators, parents, policy makers, elected officials and business leaders.
Christina Ellis | Daily Trojan
More than 750 student organizations and university departments have been invited to take part in the dialogue. The events will include student-led conferences on education reform, workshops preparing students for success in college and an Ed Fair, which will feature a range of organizations highlighting internships and job opportunities in the educational field.
EdMonth events will not be available to only those on campus. Students and educators both on campus and across the nation can tune into online streams of select panel discussions on the EdMonth website.
Director of the Women’s Student Assembly Kaya Masler described EdMonth as an opportunity to have an open discussion about the state of education in America.
“EdMonth is about having a broader view of education and an improved value of education,” Masler said. “Education is more than text books and literacy tests — it’s about awareness.”
Assistant director of the Latino Student Assembly Valerie Fernandez emphasized the important role that diversity will play in EdMonth.
“EdMonth has been capable of uniting students of all colors and all types of cultures, ethnicities and backgrounds behind one cause — education,” Fernandez said. “This initiative has allowed us to highlight a breadth of education-related issues hidden within each of our communities so that we can tackle them together, one step at a time.”
The EdMonth opening kick-off event will take place Monday at 7 p.m. in Bovard Auditorium. The event, which will discuss investing in our future leaders, will feature notable panelists including Grammy Award-winning artist and philanthropist John Legend and Los Angeles Unified School District Superintendent John Deasy.
Minor clarification — I said “literacy tests” not “literally tests”. Nice article overall though. Go ed month!

A poll by the Sol Price School of Public Policy and the Los Angeles Times indicates that mayoral candidates Eric Garcetti and Wendy Greuel are neck and neck in the Los Angeles City primary election on Tuesday.
The poll, conducted between  Feb. 24-27,  found that L.A. City Councilmember Garcetti had support from 27 percent of voters, while City Controller Greuel had 25 percent.
Kevin James, the only Republican candidate in the race, garnered 15 percent of the vote, while Jan Perry had support from 14 percent of voters questioned.
Approximately half of the voters in favor of Garcetti or Greuel said they might change their vote before the election.
Twenty-six percent of voters said the top issue in the election is balancing the city’s budget, with 18 percent saying job creation and 17 percent saying education reform.
The poll’s margin of error for the poll was plus or minus 4.4 percent.
The winner of the primary election will advance to the runoff election in May 21.
Figures, LA voters like corruption, high taxes, over development, lousy city services, plenty of potholes that wreck your car, high parking rates, etc.

USC’s Air Force ROTC Detachment 060 hosted their  48th annual Southern California Invitational Drill Meet on Saturday in Redondo Beach.
Discipline · Miguel Navarro (left to right), Garrett Bauer, Daniel Seo and Elliot Turcotte march on Saturday at the Southern California Invitational Drill Meet where more than 30 teams are awarded for performing drills. — Ralf Cheung | Daily Trojan
First started in 1965, the largest drill meet west of the Mississippi drew drill teams from all military branches across the country.
Detachment 060 consists of 63 students from 26 different universities and community colleges. Each year, more than 1,000 junior and senior ROTC cadets from more than 30 teams across the nation attend the event.
Cadet John Dike of the Air Force ROTC, a senior majoring in industrial systems engineering and a commander of the drill meet, was excited to participate in the event.
“Our detachment has hosted since 1965,” Dike said. “I’m sure the level of intensity for our competition is unparalleled. It’s going to be a lot of fun.”
The meet’s judges provide a unique and quite entertaining feature to the event each year. Teams are judged by notorious Marine Corps drill instructors from the Marine Corps Recruit Depot in San Diego. Enthusiastic and unabashed to get in a cadet’s face, these animated judges have been a big part of the tradition.
Dike said the judges are tough, but embody the perfection all drill teams strive for.
“It really throws people off, but our goal is to make it easy for everyone to act under pressure,” Dike said. “If you’re pressured by being told to do something quickly and by someone raising their voice, that’s just one more thing for us to help you overcome.”
Dike believes the lessons learned at the competition translate well to actual military experience.
“What we do here in our training and across the military is all carried over into this drill competition,” Dike said. “It’s all about just being used to these things, not being desensitized in understanding the intensity of the situation and not taking it personally.”
Past winners of this drill meet include Brigham Young University, UCLA and Oregon State University.
“It’s a great program that we run, and every year we try to make it better,” Dike said. “We definitely build legacy every single year among each competitor that comes to our event.”

These Trojans know drama all too well. On senior day and in the last game at the Galen Center for six of the Trojans’ 15 players, USC nearly blew it.
Holding steady · Senior point guard Jio Fontan (above) fouled out of Saturday’s game in 22 minutes of action, but the Trojans held on down the stretch thanks to late free throws from senior forward Eric Wise. — Ralf Cheung | Daily Trojan
 
But they didn’t. After relinquishing a 11-point second-half lead, the Trojans eked out a 57-56 win over Arizona State on Saturday after a 35-foot heave by the Sun Devils’ Jahii Carson clanked off the rim at the buzzer.
The Trojans (14-15, 9-7 Pac-12) haven’t excelled at the line in their past two games, but it was an official review and two ensuing free throws that allowed them to avenge their overtime loss to the Sun Devils (20-10, 9-8) in January.
USC led 55-52 and had possession with 53 seconds left. But after junior shooting guard J.T. Terrell bricked a jumper, senior forward Eric Wise managed to grab the rebound and get fouled. The only problem? It appeared that the shot clock expired before Wise was fouled.
After five minutes of official review and hushed anticipation in the home crowd, the referees confirmed the foul. Wise coolly hit both free throws, and USC’s lead was back to five with 19 seconds left.
“I didn’t know exactly what happened,” said USC interim head coach Bob Cantu. “We were going to plan on them having the ball and we were going to plan on defending that last possession. Then, we found out we got the free throws.”
Some on the Trojan bench had a different take.
“I knew,” said junior center Omar Oraby about the foul call. “I was right there on the bench, I saw it happen. So I knew that there was a foul and that the ball was ours. So, I wasn’t really worried about it.”
Arizona State managed to get the final possession after two layups, a Trojan turnover while inbounding the ball and a Wise miss on the front end of a one-and-one. But Carson, who led all scorers with 23 points, couldn’t get one final shot to fall. Cantu didn’t underestimate the importance of the Pac-12 win.
“It’s never easy,” Cantu said. “Everything you do in this conference is always earned, whether it’s home or away. We did a great job of hanging on, and at the end of the day we got the win.”
Wise led the Trojans with 12 points, while sophomore guard Byron Wesley had 11 points and Terrell finished with 10 points. Junior forward Dewayne Dedmon was mired in foul trouble but finished with nine rebounds and three blocks to go with four points.
The Trojans were cruising for most of the second half and went up, 46-30, with 11:08 to go. The Sun Devils shot 46.9 percent from the field in the second half compared to 37.5 percent in the opening half, but USC still maintained a 51-37 lead with 7:34 to go. Over the next two minutes, though, the Sun Devils went on an 8-0 run to cut the deficit to six.
This stretch was punctuated by a flagrant foul by USC’s most tenured starter, senior point guard Jio Fontan. Fontan had exited the game eight minutes earlier after falling hard to the floor following a missed jumper and coming up holding his right wrist. But in his last game at home, Fontan went to the locker room, wrapped up his wrist and returned after missing about six minutes of the game.
“The trainer said he probably couldn’t,” Cantu said on Fontan’s return to the game. “I looked down the bench and asked [Fontan] if he could go, and he said ‘Yeah.’”
Following his return, Fontan was dribbling the ball up the court when, while trying to shield his wrist, he swung and connected his elbow with Carson. Carson made the two free throws given for the ensuing flagrant foul call on Fontan, and then hit a jumper on the ensuing possession to convert a four-point play.
“The rules are the rules,” Fontan said. “I swung my elbows, not intentionally to hit him, of course. I knew he knew it wasn’t intentional … [but] it was the right call.”
Another issue that flared up in the second half was USC’s struggle to guard seven-foot-two ASU center Jordan Bachynski. The Canadian product had 12 of his 17 points in the second half and could force Cantu and the coaching staff to make adjustments in the post defense.
“The key to it is if you can stop penetration, you don’t give any advantage,” Cantu said. “If penetration is coming from the top of the wing, then all of a sudden people are in a scramble and people are helping up and giving them opportunities to get layups and dunks.”
In a gesture to his departing players, Cantu went with an all-senior starting lineup. This included the first starts of the season for center James Blasczyk and guard Tyler Sugiyama — in fact, it was Sugiyama’s first start of his four-year tenure at USC. Sugiyama played 60 seconds and then was subbed out to the chorus of an appreciative ovation from the home crowd.
The Trojans raced out to a 28-9 lead, as Arizona State made just three of their first 16 shots. USC’s suffocating defense let down as the Sun Devils went on an 11-3 run to end the half down just 11, but the Trojans were by far the better squad in the opening half. The Trojan bench also outscored ASU, 16-3, in the first half and 34-10 for the game.

On March 5, USC students and Angelenos will vote in the mayoral primary election, a race that will impact the university’s relationship with the mayor’s office.
If no candidate gets more than 50 percent of the vote, the top two primary finishers will advance to the general election on May 21. The race consists of four frontrunners: councilmember Eric Garcetti, city controller Wendy Greuel, radio talk show host and lawyer Kevin James and councilmember Jan Perry.
The winning candidate will serve the city for the next four years, replacing outgoing Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa, who has served since 2005.
“There’s an incredible amount of work that goes in to maintaining USC’s relations with the mayor’s office and with the city,” said David Galaviz, the executive director of local government relations for USC.
Galaviz explained that the university serves as a tremendous asset for the city of Los Angeles. Not only is it one of the largest private-sector employers in the city, but the school also trains and educates students who go on to make contributions to Los Angeles.
“It really is in the city’s best interest to work alongside USC, improving both the school and local community,” Galaviz said.
Help from the city takes many forms. City services comprise everything from public safety to street repavement to traffic control, all of which can have a large impact on the university.
“Our partnership with the city helps ensure the efficiency of USC,” Galaviz said.
Some students believe the new mayor should have a more open dialogue with students.
“[The mayor] can start by addressing deeply rooted cultural issues in the Los Angeles community,” said Perry Nunes, a sophomore majoring in economics and critical studies. “Whether that be through something as subtle as addressing these issues in public dialogues and speeches or something as extensive as community-based programming that involves the university.”
Some students believe the mayor’s impact only reaches the community around the campus and does not directly affect them.
“The L.A. mayor has to focus on the community around USC in terms of public safety, education and promoting growth in the surrounding area,” said Brandon Cheung, a freshman majoring in political science.
A method for students to get involved is through internships at the office of the mayor.
“We strongly encourage Trojans to participate in city internships,” Galaviz said.
Over the next few months, USC will work to develop new contacts with city staffers and ensure the preservation of the city-university relationship.
“We’ll enter an interim period of learning and development as the city settles in with its new leadership,” said Craig Keys, associate senior vice president for civic engagement at USC. “We don’t expect to see tremendous changes in policy — at least not those that influence the school directly.”
Keys went on to explain the importance of student engagement in the municipal political process.
“As voters, [students] have the opportunity to shape the future of the city and the quality of life on and around campus,” Keys said.
Though USC is a private institution, city policies can supplement the quality and variety of services accessible to students. Keys said this could include housing and mental health services provided by the city.
“The availability and implementation of city services can have large impacts on student life and experience,” Keys said. “We look forward to building strong relationships with new staff and the successor mayor.”
Many students agree that the new mayor has the responsibility of building new ties with students on campus.
“The new mayor has the opportunity to show USC students how and why it is important to get invested in local politics,” said USG residential senator Maheen Sahoo, a junior majoring in philosophy, politics and law. “If he or she actively engages with us and with other neighboring institutions in an open dialogue, USC students will certainly learn a lot more about how local initiatives affect them.”

It has never been much of a secret that teenagers and young adults’ perceptions of body image are influenced by movie stars and TV shows.
In fact, Lena Dunham, star of the HBO show Girls, has received a broad mix of criticism and recognition for her decision to take her average-shaped body and go nude on television.
Many criticize Dunham for taking the part too far. For example, in one recent episode, it appeared somewhat unnecessary to play pingpong without a shirt on, not to mention going all out and wearing a mesh shirt without a bra (but who knows, maybe that’s a normal thing for some people).
Others say her openness and self-confidence is refreshing. In a way, Dunham is saying, “It is OK to be normal” (and naked).
During one episode of Girls, a boyfriend asks Dunham’s character about her weight. She responds, “No, I have not tried a lot to lose weight. Because I decided I was going to have some other concerns in my life.” Imagine that — girls having more on their minds aside from not eating.
In an E! interview on the red carpet, Dunham explained why she goes nude so often.
“I hope that my presence and that of my cast members on television has given people some sense that a range of body types is appropriate and even wonderful on TV,” she said.
Despite the controversy on whether or not baring it all on the TV screen is beneficial or off-putting, it is indisputable that Dunham and other current TV stars are working on creating a new normal.
But though Dunham might have good intentions, the fact that she won a Golden Globe for her role and that the show is so well-liked does not necessarily mean a revolution is occurring regarding female body types.
A recent Cosmopolitan article, and many other articles since Girls debuted, argues that stars, such as Dunham, The Voice’s Christina Aguilera and The Mindy Project’s Mindy Kaling, are redefining body standards.
In order to see how this idea is misguided, however, all that’s necessary is to look at how each of these stars have had to defend their bodies and explain that they’re making a difference. Once these women no longer need to explain to the media how they are creating change, the mission will be accomplished.
In Kaling’s book, Is Everybody Hanging Out Without Me? (And Other Concerns), she often addresses the issue of her body weight.
“My body mass image is not ideal,” Kaling writes. “Since I am not model-skinny, but also not super-fat and fabulously owning my hugeness, I fall into that nebulous, ‘Normal American Woman Size’ that legions of fashion stylists detest. For the record, I’m a size eight (this week, anyway). Many stylists hate that size because, I think, to them, I lack the self-discipline to be an aesthetic, or the sassy, confidence to be a total fatty hedonist. They’re like ‘Pick a lane.’”
Moreover, in an early episode of The Mindy Project, Kaling’s co-worker tells her that she would look much better if she lost 15 pounds. Kaling’s character, instead of getting utterly upset and going on some sort of insane water diet, is, as The New York Times described, “irked but not undone.”
Nonetheless, Kaling is not fat. Rather, like Dunham, she is normal and not afraid to show it. In fact, like most girls everywhere, her body weight fluctuates. The problem is that Kaling is constantly defending herself to the media, explaining that she’s normal, when it should just be a known fact that does not need to be reinforced.
On HelloGiggles, in an article titled, “Why Lena Dunham’s Body Matters (And Why It’s Ridiculous That It Does),” Michelle Konstantinovsky discusses the ludicrousness of Dunham’s body size.
“Dunham’s body is what women see in dressing rooms, in locker rooms and in the mirror,” Konstantinovsky said. But nevertheless, Konstantinovsky still asks the question: “Seeing it in a space typically reserved for stick-thin starlets seems somehow avant-garde. And that’s just silly, isn’t it?”
Hence, TV will only have truly created the new normal when people are no longer shocked to see the average size on TV — and when it no longer calls for a full spread in Entertainment Weekly or a special on VH1.
Moreover, what’s often ignored is that these girls do not just represent a normal, healthy body weight with a confident attitude, but also represent TV’s new vision of normal people.
It’s great that people focus on the body weight issue, but it’s also interesting to look at how TV personalities and human traits have changed over time.
Not only has TV been historically critical of body weight, creating unreasonable standards, but it also has created the ideal girl. She’s not only thin, but she’s also sweet, hilarious, sassy and sexually appealing (but not promiscuous).
Yes, Kaling is a size eight instead of a double zero, but she’s also a genuine person who makes mistakes, blurts out the wrong things and is often insecure about what she wears and looks like.
She’s a true girl, a real girl. And lately, true girls have taken over TV — one just has to open her eyes and look beyond waist size.
In Bunheads, an ABC Family show produced by the creator of the once-epic Gilmore Girls, the girls might be fairly svelte, but that does not mean they are not real.
The premise comes from a drunken “mistake” made by Sutton Foster’s character, Michelle, who gets married after one crazy night in Las Vegas. She’s not an ideal person. She blurts out inappropriate things, wears clothes others see as tasteless, dances promiscuously and is sarcastic.
Also, the character Boo is not the ideal body weight, especially for a ballerina. Nevertheless, she does not give up on her dreams to be a dancer. She constantly has to defend her weight because her body is not ideal for her desired profession. Though she is insecure at times, she still fights her battle and is true to herself (as cliche as it sounds).
Nevertheless, characters like those played by Foster, Dunham and Kaling, bring a new light to TV. With their utter geniality and authenticity, viewers can truly connect with them and understand their tragedies and good fortunes.
Still, change can only come once these stars no longer have to explain the reasons behind their ordinary characters. But the important thing is a real character has more to her than just a few extra pounds.

uh, lena dunham isn’t “normal”, she’s fat, and it’s really gross every time she disrobes on screen. I get that she’s trying to make a point about body image, but it’s still incredibly off-putting.
So true and very well said Mollie Berg!!!!

For college students attempting to get good pricing on Greek rush apparel or searching for the perfect student club shirt, ordering custom T-shirts can be a hassle. Sometimes the time and effort required to find quality printed tees at a reasonable price can be more trouble than it’s worth.
A new product launched by USC students, however, has an answer for that.
Started by juniors Jason Wei and Sarah Bernosky, taggle centralizes the screen-printing market by bringing together customers seeking to order custom apparel with local mom-and-pop screen printers. On taggle’s site, customers post their T-shirt order and local printers bid against each other to secure the business order.

As there are hundreds of printers in Los Angeles alone, the bidding process allows students to get a better deal on bulk orders. At the same time, it helps local printers tap into the college market.
“Through the implementation of this reverse-auction model, the competitive bidding process adds value to both buyer and seller; customers get the best prices for their shirts without the hassle, and printers have easy access to new business,” Wei said.
Using taggle is simple. A customer goes to taggle’s website and provides the basic order details such as quantity, color and brand. Then, they use a design tool to drag and drop pre-made graphics and text or upload photos from their computers. Once they have completed their design, it is posted to the site and email notifications are then sent to taggle’s network of printers.
Printers can then compete for the business by updating their bids over a 24-hour period until the competition closes. At this time, the customer can then select a competitively priced printer.
“We hope to revolutionize the way people order custom apparel. With the reverse-auction model, a true win-win situation is created for both printers and customers,” Wei said. “EBay and Amazon were able to change the way people shopped online. Taggle’s goal is to change the way people order custom apparel.”
The idea for taggle came to Wei after facing numerous frustrations with the world of custom-apparel ordering himself. He realized that the current way of ordering custom T-shirts was extremely inefficient and that there was an opportunity for a business to change the game and make an immediate impact on the market.
“After noticing friends in different fraternities and student organizations getting constantly ripped off by national printers, I started looking into the specific problems with this current method,” Wei said.
When researching the custom T-shirt market, he discovered that there were two main routes people took when ordering custom T-shirts for their clubs. The first route, using large companies (CustomInk, Kotis Design), makes custom ordering extremely easy to do, but is very pricey in exchange. The second route forces people to spend hours looking for specific quotes from various local printers. Though one might get a better deal in the end, the hours that can go into the process make it frustrating and tedious.
Wei came up with the idea of using a reverse-auction model to solve both problems in one fell swoop.
“No longer do people have to settle with one benefit and one cost,” he said. “Using taggle’s reverse-auction system allows customers to get the best prices on the market with an extremely easy-to-use service.”
The initial customers are college student organizations, Wei said.
Because of this, he said, taggle is focused on increasing its presence among USC students. Since its launch in January, taggle has worked with seven USC student organizations: Phi Gamma Delta Fraternity, Tau Kappa Epsilon Fraternity, Kappa Sigma Fraternity, Pi Kappa Phi Fraternity, Delta Chi Fraternity, TAMID and the Kurth/Park Undergraduate Student Government campaign. Part of taggle’s agenda is to positively impact the USC community by providing a service that student leaders can trust and enjoy.
“As someone involved in several USC organizations, I can personally relate to the poor experiences that club leaders have had with ordering something as integral as T-shirts,” Wei said.
The business has gained momentum by reaching out to club leaders and inquiring about spring T-shirt plans at USC and UCLA, the two locations taggle has targeted. Doing so has allowed the company to gain enough orders to test its beta model.
Currently, taggle is focused on learning from its beta round by making significant upgrades and additions to the website. Wei said the goal is to perfect the process as much as possible on these two campuses and then scale to other universities.
Wei said that taggle would not be where it is today without the university.
“USC really lends a huge hand with young student entrepreneurs and our team have been appreciative of the benefits we’ve enjoyed from that,” Wei said. “Needless to say, the Trojan Family and strong alumni network has benefited us tremendously as well.”
For Wei, the very best thing about taggle is the core team it has put together. Taggle is crosstown collaboration of USC and UCLA students besides Wei and Bernosky: There’s Connor Eichten, co-founder and CFO who is a sophomore at UCLA studying business economics, and Chris Del Guercio, co-founder and CTO, who is a senior studying computer engineering and computer science.
“The team that taggle has right now is not only innovative, passionate and bright, but also extremely well-equipped to adapt to tough circumstances in the future,” Weigh said. “I am fully confident that with this team, we will be able to scale at a high level and achieve a large amount of success in the future.

oh wow, greater competition produces less cost to consumer and the creation of more business? wow what a concept, but I though capitalism was evil?
You need my bank account and routing number? Sure, let me do that! As a printer being in an already competitive market, I have no interest in this. Sure, if you want to see who can go out of business first, be my guest. I’m keeping my doors open, producing a top quality product and service. If I was in my basement, I may reconsider joining this website.

Aggressively coming at you from across the pond with high-speed chases, intense interrogations and gunfights throughout, The Sweeney hits every police action-flick note.
The movie, which is a remake of a ’70s British TV show, centers around the police-run Flying Squad, nicknamed “the Sweeney,” as it fights armed robberies throughout the city of London. The Sweeney consists of ex-criminals and tough guys who operate under the idea that you need to act like a criminal in order to beat the criminals. They come in, guns blazing, and often get their man while leaving their unfortunate supervisors behind to clean up the property damage.
Tough as nails · Detective Inspector Jack Regan, played by Ray Winstone (right), interrogates Detective Chief Inspector Ivan Lewis, played by Steven Mackintosh (left), in the film spin-off of the popular ’70s U.K. TV show, The Sweeney. Despite his age, Winstone manages to maintain a tough-guy persona throughout the film, making it easy for audiences to dislike him. — Photo courtesy of Entertainment One Films US
The movie opens with the Sweeney smashing through a wall and confronting a group of criminals in the act of committing a robbery. The group gets the bad guys — but only after they destroy the wall and are left standing between piles of rubble.
When a series of connected robberies start to hit London, the Sweeney finds itself in a showdown with a mastermind criminal. The movie isn’t remotely shy at all about hitting all the cop movie cliches. Grumbling supervisors take away guns and badges, sketchy informants are visited in shady bars and criminals are chased in the streets. (The car chases specifically are notable for being coordinated with help of the acclaimed U.K. TV show Top Gear, and the quality of the scene is apparent.)
You get the sense that the film relishes the opportunity that these tried-and-true cliched scenes provide. Many scenes begin by lulling the audience into a sense of I’ve-seen-all-this-before and then suddenly throw out a surprise, giving the audience a quick jolt.
An early scene comes to mind: A criminal and a team member end up separated from the main fight and their weapons are kicked away in the scuffle. The two belligerents fight to get the gun that is just out of reach. The bad guy ends up against the wall with his Sweeney adversary in front of him.
The baddie smirks and pulls a knife out of his pocket, while the policeman’s face starts to show fear. It’s a scene that has been filmed a thousand times. As the knife is being raised, however, two hands smash through the wooden wall behind and the baddie is nicked. (“We’re the Sweeney, you’re nicked” was the catchphrase from the original TV series, which is the only real knowledge from the series that would improve the experience of the movie.)
Ray Winstone, who is 56 but looks at least 10 years older than that, continues the curious recent trend of older action stars fighting and beating up much younger bad guys, such as Liam Neeson in Taken or Sylvester Stallone in The Expendables. He plays Jack Regan, the absolute pit bull of a man leading the Sweeney. He’s fat, foul-mouthed and hyper-aggressive. At various times, he’s downright unlikable, but, at the same time, it makes him much easier to believe than most others in the older badass role. When one sees Stallone or our ex-governor Schwarzenegger running around, deadpanning jokes in their Hollywood tans, it’s always a bit hard to suspend disbelief. Winstone, with all his growling and scowling, doesn’t have that problem at all. An old, grizzled tough guy, he might not always be the most relatable, but he is compelling. It is difficult to take your eyes off him.
Additionally, what Winstone lacks in relatability is balanced by English rapper Ben Drew, who plays the Sweeney’s second-in-command. Drew’s supremely likeable, performance balances out Winstone’s gruffer dynamic. The rest of the cast is similarly peppered with fine British actors, most notably Damian Lewis of Homeland and Hayley Atwell of Captain America.
The Sweeney takes a lot of influence from the Guy Richie-type of British crime films, such as Lock Stock, Two Smoking Barrels and Snatch, as there is cockney rhyming slang throughout and actors from those movies play key supporting roles. Those movies managed to show the camaraderie between a team working to break the law while simultaneously maintaining a very comedic base.
The Sweeney does similarly, though from the other side of the law.
The movie is truly very funny at times, (though some of the jokes are difficult to pick up through thick cockney accents) and the story manages to find some depth beyond the action. It doesn’t really matter though. The top-notch action and Winstone’s cannonball-to-the-chest of a leading man make the film worth watching.

This past week, school officials in Colorado decided that Coy Mathis, a 6-year-old girl born with a male body, cannot use female bathroom facilities at her school. The decision to leave Coy dealing with such a divisive and uncomfortable situation is shocking and reflects poorly on Colorado and LGBT protections in the state.
Even though she has used the girls’ bathroom in her previous years in the Fountain-Fort Carson school district, officials now say Coy will no longer be “allowed” to use that facility. Instead, Coy will have to use the boys’ room, the staff bathroom or the nurse’s bathroom, according to CNN. The school is preventing Coy from using the girl’s bathroom because they foresee problems when Coy hits puberty.
Nick Cimarusti | Daily Trojan
Of course, puberty doesn’t start until around age 10, and it appears the school’s officials here are basing their decision on something that isn’t even close to becoming an issue yet. In Texas v. United States (1998), the Supreme Court looked at a another “preventative” measure and quoted an earlier case saying, “a claim is not ripe for adjudication if it rests upon contingent future events that may not occur as anticipated, or indeed may not occur at all.” School officials need to learn from the Supreme Court’s discretion and realize that this is the wrong time to address the issue.
If, as the school “predicts,” a parent complains about a pubescent Coy using the girls’ restroom, then that would be a much more appropriate time to address the issue. But, thankfully, the Colorado Anti-Discrimination Act provides protection for members of the LGBT community and the school’s policy would undoubtedly be examined. Nevertheless, it is important to realize that the judgment by the school is predicated on future hypothetical conditions. Stigmatizing a child before she even graduates elementary school is boorish at best.
There is no point in speculating about what might happen in the future. Analyses of the facts right now show that Coy should be afforded equal protection at this time. The current Colorado law as written prevents schools from discriminating against the use of public facilities based on transgender status. This is a clear case of the school district stigmatizing a little girl because she was born a boy.
Right now, with the current set of facts, Coy should be allowed to use the girls’ bathroom and should not face discrimination at school.
The Colorado Girl Scouts faced a similar situation recently when Bobby Montoya, who was also born with a male body, said she wanted to join the Girl Scouts. Though local troops initially banned Bobby from joining, the Colorado Girl Scouts quickly responded, according to Mother Jones, by saying  that “if a child identifies as a girl and the child’s family presents her as a girl, Girl Scouts of Colorado welcomes her as a Girl Scout.”
The school district needs to follow the Girl Scouts’ example. On her official U.S. passport and Colorado ID card, Coy’s gender is listed as female. If the state and the federal government acknowledge that Coy is female, then the school district should likewise accept that Coy is a girl and not stigmatize her for being born with a male body.
Interestingly, the school in question, Eagleside Elementary, is located just outside of Colorado Springs, one of the most conservative areas in Colorado. Colorado Springs consistently takes conservative or libertarian stances on policies in Colorado. The conservatism of Colorado Springs could be a reason for the oddly non-progressive decision by school officials in Coy’s case.
Of course, if it is the political leanings of Colorado Springs influencing policy in the nearby school district, then the officials of the region should reexamine their own philosophies about personal freedoms. The libertarian movement is strong within that area, and classic libertarian philosophy aims to keep the government out of the lives of individuals and allow each person to make decisions that are best for them.
Clearly, the best course of action for Coy is to be allowed to use the girl’s bathroom. The school district should not interfere with the wishes of Coy in this matter.
The issue is not yet ripe for decision or litigation. The school district would do better to ignore the issue right now. Down the road, Colorado hopefully will protect the rights of Coy as a female. After all, Coy probably just wants to be like everyone else her age.

To Coy’s Dad, The author of article and our supporters:
I thank you. I knew when I was three that I was really a girl. I was hospitalized, medicated, and religion was forced into me. Oh I tried to adapt and play along. But As soon as I reached age 21 I after years of never passing as a straight normal cis male. I decided to be the true me, a female.
I have not one regret. True I struggle with depression, but that due to being seen as the lowest in society. I am seen as a shoplifter, junkie, prostitute. And the fact that I cant afford the medical interventions I need is a trgger as well.
However reading about parents like Coy’s, and reading these articles, and reading our supporters posts makes this dark world not so awful. I am 34 now and should I make to be say 54 I am confident that I wouldnt have to worry about being harrased, and followed, as certainly I must be up to no good. Or have complete strangers try and fight me as I “still have the strength of a man”. nevermind that all the Testerone blockers for 13 years and hsormones plus a bilateral Orchiectomy. Smh. Anyhow These attitudes are on the way out, and you all are helping bring hope to the jaded hopeless.
“On her official U.S. passport and Colorado ID card, Coy’s gender is listed as female. If the state and the federal government acknowledge that Coy is female, then the school district should likewise accept that Coy is a girl and not stigmatize her for being born with a male body.”
This. It doesn’t make sense that even the state recognizes Coy’s gender, but the school she goes to won’t.
I’m a black guy born in a white guy’s body. If you don’t award me the benefits of affirmative action, I will cry discrimination.
LOL
You are trivializing a little girls life so that you can make an irrelevant point about racial policy. I guess I don’t even understand what you are thinking.
Thank you for this fantastic article!!!

One might think that by year 2013, the question of whether or not people of color can vote in public elections would long have been relegated to the history books. Unfortunately, it is not a matter of the past alone.
It appears that the Supreme Court is poised to strike down section five of the Voting Rights Act of 1965, according to NBC News. For those who are unfamiliar with the act, section five states that certain jurisdictions with a history of racial discrimination at polls must submit for preclearance from the Department of Justice before modifying any of their existing voting laws.
This legislation has been previously reaffirmed by the Supreme Court eight times in a variety of cases. Now, however, Shelby County in Alabama is challenging the section, arguing that it is irrelevant because there is no longer any significant voter discrimination. In Shelby County’s eyes, the provision is actually a discrimination against those jurisdictions that must report to the Department of Justice.
For Shelby County, there is no longer any legislation in practice that discriminates on the premise of skin color, and all current legislation officially encourages multiracial participation in the democratic process. They are right — there is no legislation that explicitly restricts minorities from voting. Yet, the viewpoint that voter discrimination does not exist has flaws.
Last year’s election saw, for the first time, the widespread implementation of new types of laws that don’t officially discriminate but still impact certain communities and races disproportionately. Some of these laws, widely known as “voter ID laws,” were implemented in an alleged effort to reduce the rate of voter fraud (notwithstanding that the rate of present voter fraud in the United States is somewhere between zero and negligible, according to ABC News).
By and large, these laws require voters to show up to the polls with a specific form of identification; it’s often a driver’s license, which many older minority voters simply do not have. Though these individuals can usually provide some form of identification, a citizen cannot vote unless the identification is the specific sort called for by the voting region.
Other forms of voter suppression were apparent too. In Ohio, legislation was passed that severely restricted the amount of time voters could mail in their ballot or vote early. Unlike prior years, which allowed up to five weekends’ time, citizens could only vote one weekend prior to the election. Indeed, early voting opportunities are usually taken advantage of by poor, minority and elderly voters, according to U.S. News & World Report.
It seems then that, counter to what Shelby County is arguing, the existence of voter ID laws and modifications to early voting processes in the 2012 election proves the necessity of section five of the Voters Rights Act even today.
Nevertheless, Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia suggested last week that the only reason the Voter Rights Act has been reaffirmed so many times in the Supreme Court and Congress is because politicians are afraid of voting against a bill of “racial entitlement.” He goes on to say in his oral arguments in Shelby County v. Holder to state that “whenever a society adopts racial entitlements, it is very difficult to get out of them through the normal political processes.”
This isn’t so much a racial entitlement as it is a human entitlement; all people should be entitled to a voice in the American democratic process. Scalia’s viewpoint is flawed insofar as it views racial entitlement in this context as being bad.
The word “entitlement” does a lot to suggest a negative connotation, but I’d be wary of saying that any U.S. citizen is not entitled to the rights outlined for them in our founding documents. Is voting an entitlement? Yes, it is. But it is one guaranteed to all Americans and it certainly is not one that should be tied to race.

The Voting Rights Act (VRA) must be upheld by the supreme court: Discrimination is alive today unfortunately; Liberty and justice for all is openly sabotaged and the Supreme Court is inviting trouble of great magnitudnal proportions if it dares to fail its ultimate mandate: to uphold everyone’s constitutional rights. We not only need to keep the protections in the current Voting Rights Act, it should be expanded. The numerous despicable attempts to restrict voting made during the last election cycle are proof of that. Anyone who truly believes the VRA is obsolete needs to recognize, given last years voter suppression efforts, the Jim Crowe era is biding its time, lurking in the shadows waiting for an opportunity to rear its head once again. The entire nation will speak against it because the Voting Rights Act (VRA) is not about political parties; the Voting Rights Act (VRA) is about individual rights protection. Bank on it! it is time to review; the Supreme Court’s “entitlements” as, it is no longer acting as an unbiased institution and that, your magistrates , can be amended. get up and do your job or we will make it happen! count on it! Now Even if you are dumb enough to believe that all is OK with the world and there are no reasons to have the voting rights law on the books. Then why are the the parties at opposite end’s on this ? Why are the Republicans in America trying to keep people from the poles ? Well I will tell you what I think. I think there may be a dozen or two, man and women in America that have the means to buy the power it wants to call all shots in this Country. The only way they can obtain this right now is get the people they went in office. To buy them so to say. But they know they can be stopped at the voting polls.They know the more that get out and vote there chances are reduced substantially. George Will knows this and should be ashamed. He say 47 years old. Is that old ? I don’t think so. Look at the constitution, at that II Amendment a lot older right. SS, Medicare, still very new in the big picture. But look at who wants to change them. Not working men and women, no the big bosses. They do not like to mach payments that is what this is all about. They did not like it back in the 1930s and they do not like it now. So Americans do not be fooled and all of you older people that now have this little benefit fight like h— to keep it just as it is. It just might be all there is between eating and striving !!
All the republicans crapping about The Voting Rights Act (VRA) on this board and the likes of you in the REPUBLICAN House should move aside in 2014 because the REPUBLICANS are the crux of the problem. President Obama won the elections of 2008 AND 2012 fair and square but the REPUBLICANS are not allowing him to govern through their rule of RECORD number of filibusters in the Senate and the HOUSE of REPUBLICANS has achieved nothing since it came to power in 2010. In 2014 its the REPUBLICAN’s time to go and let OBAMA our democratically elected PRESIDENT rule the country and leave a legacy behind like the achievements of the 2008-2010 years when DEMOCRATS had the House Senate and the Presidency. We want the obstructionist REPUBLICANS out of the way in 2014. We want our House and Senate back in the DEMOCRATIC hands so we can govern and achieve something. All these doomsday fiscal deadlines that REPUBLICANS keep pushing on the country will haunt them in 2014!! Mark my words. March 4th 2013. Vote Democratic always!
The question is, is the federal government a better steward of the rights of people in the USA in 2013?
An administration unwilling to protect the rights of people to travel unhindered – everyone is a suspect, noone is allowed to face an accuser, you simply get scanned, patted down and asked your business
An adminstration that continues the policy of unlimited dentention often without hearing, lawyers or trial
An administration that will not limit drone use or attacks to war zones – no limit to drone searches, no right to life, no trial, no jury
What good is voting, when you have already lost these other natural rights?
