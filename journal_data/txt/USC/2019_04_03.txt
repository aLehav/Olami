Provost Michael Quick and Senior Vice President for Legal Affairs and Professionalism Carol Mauch Amir will step down from their respective positions, Interim President Wanda Austin announced Tuesday in a letter to the USC community. Quick and Mauch Amir will officially retire June 30.
“I am personally grateful to Michael and Carol for working closely with me as we prepare for our new president’s arrival this summer,” Austin wrote in the letter. “They have shown tremendous dedication to our university and its community and have led with integrity and compassion.”
Quick and Mauch Amir’s departure comes two weeks after the University announced that former University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill Chancellor Carol Folt would be USC’s next president. Folt will begin working at the University July 1.
“President-elect [Carol] Folt will be a great leader and should have the opportunity to work with a provost of her choosing,” Quick wrote in a statement to the Daily Trojan. “I have been honored to work with faculty, staff, students and alumni to continue USC’s ascent. I look forward to continuing to work with everyone.”
Quick, who also serves as senior vice president of academic affairs, will resume his position as a professor of biological sciences at the Dornsife College of Letters, Arts and Sciences. 
In the next few weeks, Austin and Folt will name an interim provost and elect a search committee chair to find successors for both vacant positions, Austin wrote. The search committee, which will include faculty members across University departments, will work alongside Folt and Austin.
“Our search for both positions will be national in scope and exhaustive in research,” Austin wrote. “We will keep you posted on our progress, as appropriate.”
Ariela Gross, a member of the Concerned Faculty of USC, said she hopes these administrative changes will create a culture of transparency and accountability at the University. She said having President-elect Folt hire a new team of administrators is a step in the right direction.
“We will all be able to build trust and increase morale because there will be a sense that people who may have been closely involved in some of the unfortunate incidents of the past will be moving aside and new leadership will be coming in,” said Gross, a law and history professor. “That’s really important for this community to heal and move forward.” 
In looking for a new provost, Gross said the University should have an inclusive process and create a profile of what characteristics the USC community would like them to possess, such as experience working in a large institution facing similar issues and scandals. She said the new head of the legal counsel must better balance student and faculty needs with keeping the University out of lawsuits.
“The kind of arrangements that were made for someone like George Tyndall or Carmen Puliafito … suggests to me the kind of misplaced concern about the possibility that a wrongdoer might sue the University as opposed to a very real concern for the victims of a wrongdoer,” Gross said. 
Announcement of these resignations come on the heels of USC’s involvement in the college admissions bribery scheme, an increase in the number of plaintiffs named in the sexual assault case against former campus gynecologist George Tyndall and the growing sexual harassment lawsuit against former campus men’s health doctor Dennis Kelly. 
“We have had recent challenges but we will rise to the occasion and emerge stronger for having faced them,” Quick wrote. “This is a transformative university and the best place to be. Let’s make Fight On more than a slogan, let’s make it a call to action.” 
Quick also handled complaints regarding former Keck School of Medicine Dean Carmen Puliafito who the Los Angeles Times revealed partied with students and used methamphetamines while seeing patients in 2017.
After news broke in May of Tyndall’s alleged abuse of former and current USC students, Quick sent a memo to the USC community citing that the event filled him with “regret, shame and frustration.” 
Austin wrote that during his tenure as provost, Quick has focused on advancing the international profile of the University by recruiting renowned faculty and encouraging University efforts in social justice, the letter read.
“In returning to the faculty, Michael will continue to share his wisdom and wit with colleagues and students,” Austin wrote.
In addition to announcing Quick’s resignation from provost, Austin’s letter revealed that Mauch Amir would also be stepping down from her position.
Since she began working at USC 20 years ago, Mauch Amir has led several health and legal initiatives. This year, she oversaw the establishment of the Office of Professionalism and Ethics and helped created the President’s Culture Commission and the Working Group on Culture. She has also worked with the audit and compliance committee within the Board of Trustees to expand reporting and monitoring practices.
In a statement to the Daily Trojan, Mauch Amir said she looks forward to her time off and is proud of the work she did in her tenure at USC. 
“With strong leadership in the Offices of Professionalism and Ethics, General Counsel, Ethics and Compliance and Internal Audit, I feel confident I am leaving the University in good stead as we prepare for the transition to the next presidency,” Mauch Amir wrote.

Violence broke out at a vigil held in memory of rapper and South Los Angeles community activist Nipsey Hussle Monday night. Fire officials said 19 people were transported to hospitals, with two in critical condition and two in serious condition, following a stampede that broke out as a result of panic due to a pulled handgun. 
The vigil was held at Marathon Clothing on Slauson Avenue, the store that Nipsey Hussle co-owned and outside of which he was shot and killed Sunday. The Grammy-nominated rapper and two other men were standing outside the Hyde Park store when the suspect — who the police identified as Eric Holder, 29, of Los Angeles on Tuesday — approached and spoke with them multiple times before opening fire, Los Angeles Police Department Chief Michael Moore said at a news conference. 
Nipsey Hussle, whose real name is Ermias Asghedom, is remembered by city officials as a passionate advocate for his native Crenshaw community. He was scheduled to meet with LAPD leaders and representatives from Roc Nation, rapper Jay-Z’s entertainment company, to ideate efforts to help local children and stop gang violence. 
“He was working closely with the city to help save lives and transform lives, even as he was doing that for himself,” Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti said at the news conference. “He was a tireless advocate for the young people of this city and of this world, to lift them up with the possibility of not being imprisoned by where you come from or past mistakes.” 
Department of Public Safety Chief John Thomas echoed Garcetti’s sentiments and attributed strides made by the community to combat gang violence to the rapper’s advocacy and outreach. 
“Our community has gotten to a point where they are willing to work with the police because that’s the only way we’re going to [stop] some of this,” Thomas said in an interview with the Daily Trojan. “The best tribute to Nipsey is that he was willing to work with the police. You have to be engaged and you have to work in concert with law enforcement if you want to have … mutually inclusive, respectful relationships that are designed to provide for a safer community.” 
Thomas said he emphasized the importance of working with police and playing a larger role in the community when he met with black students Monday night. 
“I was telling our students … that if they really want to do something constructive to be a part of some of the dialogue in the community relative to gang violence as opposed to just reacting and responding irrationally,” Thomas said. “Get involved and be a part of the solution. Get involved and work with interventionists if you so desire.” 
Following Nipsey Hussle’s death, rumors of a gang-related crime spree taking place in South L.A. circulated on social media. USC DPS announced Monday that there is no reason to believe these rumors are credible or that there is a threat in the USC area. 
“DPS has confirmed with South Los Angeles Gang Interventionists and LAPD’s Gang Unit that there is no evidence to support the social media rumors,” DPS tweeted.
DPS and LAPD have the following recommendations for students to stay safe. 
“[We] are being extra vigilant in their patrols and ask that students are careful to practice safe behaviors such as not walking alone off campus after dark, taking Campus Cruiser or Lyft, and immediately reporting any suspicious circumstances to DPS,” DPS tweeted.

USC Athletics published a letter from Athletic Director Lynn Swann in response to a Los Angeles Times story released Monday criticizing Swann for signing autographs for money in Virginia over the weekend. 
The L.A. Times article said Swann made money at a memorabilia convention that reportedly charged fans $220 for an autograph, while the rest of the University’s athletic department dealt with the fallout of the college admissions bribery scandal in Los Angeles. 
“The article would have you believe that I traveled to sign autographs with no concern for what is going on at USC,” Swann wrote in his letter addressed to Trojan fans. “Nothing could be further from the truth.” 
Swann said he was contractually obligated to appear in Virginia and the visit did not interfere with his communication with the University.
“While on this brief weekend trip back East, I was constantly connected with people at our university,” Swann wrote. “Also, as a matter of principle, I live up to my commitments and contractual obligations. I signed a contract months ago to appear at the event, well before news broke of what is going on at USC now. Not showing up would have been a breach of contract.”  
USC is currently at the center of the bribery scheme, with 16 individuals indicted in relation to USC. USC fired senior athletic administrator Donna Heinel and well renown head water polo coach Jovan Vavic in March after the investigation surfaced.
The L.A. Times article quoted former USC linebacker Riki Ellison who scrutinized Swann for trying to make money. 
“Lynn’s a good guy, but isn’t his salary in the millions?” Ellison told the L.A. Times. “Why does he need to do this? It’s just embarrassing.”
Ellison further commented on the current state of USC Athletics, which has endured losing records from football and basketball. 
“The program is unraveling. … If you’re Lynn Swann, how does [going to an autograph show] gain additional credibility for USC?” he said to the L.A. Times. 
Swann said he spent his time on the trip connecting with people to benefit the University, and that he was fulfilling a commitment made months ago. After explaining this position, he responded to Ellison’s comment saying that he did not understand the details. 
Swann also made it clear that he doesn’t commonly attend autograph shows. The last one he attended was five years ago. 
“I will make decisions that will help our student-athletes succeed and make all of us better,” Swann said in his letter. “I do not make decisions in a vacuum without input from others. I do not make decisions without weighing multiple factors. As I have always done, I will do my best for this organization.”

Speakers discussed the global refugee crisis and the experiences of asylum speakers at the Summit on Refugees and Human Rights hosted by USC’s foreign service fraternity Delta Phi Epsilon and the Global Policy Institute.
The lineup included Aicha Adoulaye Mahamane, an asylee from Niger, and Najeeba Sayeed, associate professor of interreligious education at Claremont School of Theology. 
Shira Alcouloumre, vice president of external affairs at Delta Phi Epsilon, opened the summit with a short introduction and highlighted the importance of open conversations focused on global humanitarian crises. 
“We decided to speak about the refugee crisis because it’s begun to dissipate from conversation as we’re focusing more internally on domestic instability,” said Alcouloumre, a junior majoring in international relations.
Mahamane told the audience about how she was abused as a young girl in Niger and forced into marriage at age 16 before she fled and sought asylum in the United States in 2004. 
“Being an asylee in America … is not a choice. It’s your last option … something that you have to do,” Mahamane said. “The person that I was living with tried to make me his wife even though I was fleeing marriage in Niger. He forced me to have sex with him. He forced me to do things I didn’t want to do. I felt I didn’t have a choice because first of all I didn’t speak English, I didn’t know if I could trust [the] police.”
Through her journey, Mahamane said she found a support system in the Tahirih Justice Center, a nonprofit organization that provided her with access to a therapist and lawyers. 
“When I met Tahirih Justice Center, they … helped me to file for my asylum cases and have my Green Card,” she said. 
Mahamane also said she watched “The Ellen DeGeneres Show” to learn English and recalled the hope the comedian’s talk show gave her while she lived in New York City.
During the question and answer portion, Mahamane explained why young girls are forced into marriages in some countries. Mahamane encouraged audience members to push for young girls’ rights by educating girls and their parents. 
“We need more institutions to empower young girls to know themselves and also to educate parents that … your kids have their own dreams and aspirations,” she said.
Sayeed, the summit’s second speaker, spoke about her experience organizing community initiatives in Los Angeles in response to the enforcement of stricter immigration laws by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement. 
“What we decided as clergy was that we were going to take back the space outside the Metropolitan Detention Center where ICE has been detaining undocumented and other detainees,” said Sayeed, who was the Southern California Mediation Association’s Peacemaker of the Year in 2007.
Himmat Sahi, a junior majoring in international relations, said he resonated with Sayeed’s discussion. 
“I think it was really important framework for how we should treat the discourse of equality, especially as it pertains to refugees and Islamophobia,” Sahi said “I’m Sikh so this pertains a lot to my own sense of justice and how I should complete myself.” 
Claire Liu, a sophomore majoring in economics and mathematics and one of the two event organizers, said she wanted attendees to come away from the summit with a renewed interest in the refugee crisis and the policies surrounding it. 
“If we could spark more interest, more debate, more conversations about the humanity of these refugees, rather than our political ideologies, then I think this event has done its job,” Liu said.

On any given day at USC Village, dozens of people stand patiently outside of Dulce waiting for their caffeine fix. Dulce’s popularity — both at USC and in Los Angeles — can be attributed to its emphasis on hospitality. In an event organized by student entrepreneurship organization Spark SC, Dulce founder and owner James Choi shared how he came to be the mastermind behind one of the most popular local cafes.
Choi, who graduated from USC in 2005 with a degree in accounting, worked for the multinational professional services firm Ernst & Young. He then opened up Teuscher Swiss Chocolates in Palo Alto with his mother, eventually creating the first Dulce in Little Tokyo in 2011. 
Choi said that at the time, his mother was in remission from ovarian cancer, and neither his mother nor he had any prior experience in the baking industry. Although his mother had a business partner, Choi said the partner dropped out of the project three weeks before opening day, prompting himself to embark on the business venture with his mother. 
“So I put in my two weeks, left my job for the last time and I’ve been at Dulce since 2010 when I came on board,” Choi said. 
Choi said the reason for Dulce’s popularity is its emphasis on hospitality, as the franchise aims to bring about positive change in the community.
“We’re not here serving pastries and drinks and food — we serve people,” Choi said. “At the end of the day, the pastries that we make, the drinks that we slave over, the latte art that we pour that we’re proud of … that’s only as important as the person that we’re serving them to.” 
Choi said that he is primarily motivated by the belief that his hard work will pay off. Along with the support of his family, this belief aided him through the early days of running the cafe. 
“The only thing you can do is just put your head down and work,” Choi said. “And I [couldn’t] afford to hire people, so I … physically [had to] do everything that I [could]. So literally from 7 a.m. to 11 p.m., everyday for almost two years.”
When he was starting his first cafe in Little Tokyo, Choi said he found that engaging with the surrounding community is a key aspect of running a business.
“Because we gave to the community, even though we didn’t have much to give, they were the ones that patronized us during those dark times, during 2011 and 2012 when it was really slow,” Choi said.
Spark SC board member Ankur Rastogi, a senior majoring in biomedical engineering and computer science, asked Choi how he approaches his staff when they make mistakes. Choi said he tries to coach workers rather than punish them.
“It’s not about the person … It’s not ‘you didn’t do this, or you did this’ … It’s more like the behavior you choose,” Choi said.
Alicia Msei, a graduate student at the Marshall School of Business, said the event helped her realize the importance of incorporating hospitality in businesses.
“I think the most important lessons I’ve learned from the speech is that it’s interesting to know that hospitality is the most important thing,” Msei said. “It’s not about the food, but about people and to have passion in the things you do.”

Jonathan Richards recalls feeling his body shake and his stomach flip upon learning that rapper and activist Nipsey Hussle had been shot on Sunday. 
“I literally sprinted to my car and went back home and went to Slauson to figure out what was going on,” said Richards, a freshman majoring in business administration. “Then we got the tweet that he died. Everybody was in shock. We didn’t know what to do.” 
Richardson was one of the over 50 individuals who gathered in front of Tommy Trojan Tuesday night for a vigil hosted by the Black Student Assembly to honor the life of Hussle, an artist who dedicated much of his career to giving back to his home community. One by one, students and members of the local community stepped forward to speak about Hussle’s legacy and what his advocacy meant to both the South Los Angeles and black communities.
“His music and just the way he moved around life just taught me a lot about how to carry yourself how to believe in yourself,” said Nicholas Earl, a senior majoring in cinema and media studies. “The way he lived his life made me excited to live my life, and I can’t wait to get my degree, get out of here and make a bunch of money so that I can give back to my home.” 
Hussle was shot Sunday in Hyde Park outside of the store he co-owned, The Marathon Clothing, shocking many in the local community. Despite his fame, Hussle worked on youth initiatives, as well as projects like Destination Crenshaw, an art installation aimed at preserving the black culture of South L.A.
“It’s hard knowing that your hometown hero died the way he did over some stupid shit,” Richards said to the crowd. “It was like a hole was in my heart because he did so much for my community. He was there; he was the presence that everybody looked up to besides all the bullshit you see in the news … The man did so much for me and my family. He was that figure that I looked up to when temptation struck.” 
Anijah Lezama, a freshman majoring in dance, said that Hussle’s death points to the lack of resources available in the black community — something Hussle had worked to combat. 
“The black people in these communities are suffering,” Lezama said. “They need help, but there’s no access to these resources … We need to speak up, we need to get in there, we need to do more.” 
Hussle’s death isn’t the first to have impacted the USC community in the last few weeks. Victor McElhaney, a USC senior who studied jazz music, died after getting shot in a failed robbery attempt over spring break.
“This death was kind of like a double whammy,” Center for Black Cultural and Student Affairs coordinator Saphia Jackson said. “It goes to show that you really can’t take life for granted. These are all leaders in our community, whether or not you knew Victor, whether or not you knew Nipsey, or knew of him or knew of his songs or even his legacy.” 
Jackson, who co-hosted the event, said she wanted the vigil to be a place for the USC community to come together and express their respect for Hussle, whether or not they were from South L.A.
“Within this last month, I can really understand why people get bitter. It’s not even this last month it’s been the past years or so,” said Jackson, a senior majoring in public policy. “This is like my eighth or ninth time talking about gun violence, talking about another black man dying by ignorance … It hit me close to home.”

Sophomore Trenton Stone, junior Mahin Tahsin and the 12 senators-elect were inaugurated at an Undergraduate Student Government meeting Tuesday. Each member of the new administration swore an oath to serve USG’s Constitution, bylaws and Code of Ethics and USC’s student body to the best of their abilities.
“As we’re all aware, USC has encountered a few speed bumps and even roadblocks over the last few years,” Stone, now USG president, said during the meeting. “We’ve seen where, as students, our trust has been broken and where a few can take advantage of many. I want to emphasize that in our role, Mahin and I, as your representatives, will also act as your advocates.”
As the vice president, Tahsin will now lead every weekly USG meeting. According to Tahsin, the senators will dedicate the final weeks of the semester to budgeting. 
“I think this Senate is very qualified to be here,” Tahsin said. “I’ve watched them all work very hard to get here, and I’m sure their dedication to the position will follow through for the next year.” 
During the meeting, Stone announced Jeffrey Cho, a junior majoring in linguistics, as the new Chief Diversity Officer. He also introduced the seven Advocacy Assistant Directors — Tommy Nguyen, Nhat Ngo, Andrew Fowler, Nate Manor, Julian Kuffour, Neal Sivadas and Laura Pearson.
“I’m really looking forward to working with everyone else who I’m on Senate with,” Sen. Benjamin Shiff said. “Over the past month, in terms of getting ready, we had a lot of chances to talk about the initiatives we’re trying to start. We’re getting the wheels running on some projects that we want to do.” 
After the outgoing administration concluded its final meeting, the inaugurated senators took the outgoing senators’ seats and began their first official meeting. 
“I think I feel a little bittersweet to see the incoming Senate take over,” former Sen. Amy Chong said. “Words of advice I have for them is to collaborate with one another, have open communication and also to remember that the entire Senate is a team and they’re not working on an individual basis.” 
In the meeting held by the previous administration, the outgoing Senate voted unanimously to pass four resolutions, while one — the Von KleinSmid Flag Resolution — failed.
Proposed last week, the Von KleinSmid Flag Resolution failed, with four votes in support of the resolution and eight votes against it. The resolution proposed the inclusion of more flags for the countries not currently represented at VKC. Senators discussed their uncertainty about the vague state of the resolution and their desire for the upcoming administration to work on it further.
The University Sanctuary Resolution, which intends to push USC to become an official sanctuary campus, passed without discussion. The resolution aims to drive the University to create policies that would protect undocumented students.
The Responsible Investment Resolution, which seeks to establish a University task force with student representation to promote transparency among University decisions, also passed. In addition, the Terranea Resort Resolution and the Learning Experience Evaluations Resolution passed.

USC Hillel hosted Israelpalooza, its annual celebration of Yom Ha’atzmaut, or Israel Independence Day, at McCarthy Quad Tuesday. The event featured live music, Middle Eastern cuisine and guests representing Chabad and the Zionist Organization of America, among other organizations. As event-goers celebrated Israel, a group of students carried signs, banners and Palestinian flags in protest of the event, Birthright Israel and the country’s continued expansion into the West Bank and Gaza. 
Israelpalooza organizers said the event was “non-political” and meant to be a fun celebration of Israel and its role in the world. But protestors said the event was inherently political, citing the history of Palestinian displacement in the region. 
Nearly 3,500 Palestinians have been killed by Israeli security forces in the last ten years, according to the Israeli Information Center for Human Rights in the Occupied Territories. Over 400,000 Israeli nationals currently live in the West Bank, which is in violation of the Geneva Convention of 1949, according to the American Journal of International Law.
“From an outsider’s point of view, you see Israelpalooza, you see people eating cotton candy and playing music, but there’s a violent reality and a violent history that goes in hand with that,” said Yusuf Irshaad, co-president of Students for Justice in Palestine. “While people are celebrating Israelpalooza, there are still Palestinians who are in refugee camps.” 
The three-hour event saw students lining up for free falafel, hummus and frozen coffee, playing bean bag toss and listening to live music. Protestors affiliated with SJP sat directly across the quad raising Palestinian flags and signs. Earlier in the day, other students — affiliated with the activist group IfNotNow — dropped a banner that read: “Birthright: Last Chance, Confront the Crisis #JewishResistance.” 
USC Hillel Executive Director Bailey London said her organization aims to educate the public about Israel in a nonpartisan way that lets them form their own opinions. 
“As a Jewish organization on campus, we feel connected to [Israel], and we wanted to share what we love about it,” London said. 
Though Israelpalooza has seen protests in the past, London said Hillel avoids engaging with them.
“I feel deeply that every student organization has a right to exist on campus,” London said. “They’re respecting our space — they have a right to be on campus too — I just hope they don’t make any students feel uncomfortable.” 
Ellie Schneider, USC Hillel’s VP of Israel Affairs, coordinated the event. She said she invited a number of external organizations, such as Friends of the Israel Defense Forces and StandWithUs — a nonprofit pro-Israel organization — to help attendees better engage with Israeli culture. 
“We wanted this event to not be political,” said Schneider, a sophomore majoring in public relations. “This is a celebration of Israel, it’s a celebration of Israel’s independence, it’s a celebration of Israel’s role in the world.” 
After decades of Jewish exodus from Europe in response to rising anti-Semitism and the Holocaust, Israel gained its independence as the Jewish homeland on May 14, 1948, following a United Nations partition of Palestine. Schneider said the event was held a month early to avoid conflicting with final exams.
Palestinians refer to May 15 as the nakba, Arabic for “catastrophe,” in memory of the 700,000 Palestinians who were displaced as a result of Palestine’s 1947 partitioning. Today, there are over 5 million Palestinian refugees, according to the U.N. Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East.
“People can talk about Israel without even acknowledging Palestine,” Irshaad said. “But any time you talk about Palestine, it’s always linked to Israel, and that within itself shows the power dynamic.” 
Ben Barov, a junior majoring in economics, attended the event with three other students to protest the nonprofit Birthright Israel, which sponsors a 10-day trip to Israel for Jewish adults between the ages of 18 and 32, according to its website. Birthright is funded by the Israeli government, various organizations and private donors.
Barov said he was inspired by IfNotNow’s #NotJustAFreeTrip campaign, which calls for Birthright to modify its trip to educate participants on the realities of the Israeli occupation before April 5, when “hundreds of young American Jews will gather at Birthright headquarters” to protest, according to the initiative’s website. 
“The Israelpalooza event is totally inappropriate,” Barov said. “USC is lagging behind on the issue of Israel. And that’s unfortunate. That’s why IfNotNow’s role is especially important [at] USC.” 
Schneider said the Birthright table was meant to provide attendees with a “first taste” of Israel, since the trip is only available to people who have not previously visited the country. 
Former Undergraduate Student Government Sen. Shayan Kohanteb said he enjoyed the event because it represented Jewish values like “giving back” and “being eco-friendly.” 
“Different events have been happening where SJP has made Jewish students feel unsafe, but we focus on the positivity,” Kohanteb said. “We don’t even think about it, because, why should we? … [Israel] is a melting pot, just like America … We want everyone to see that there are similarities between America and Israel.”
A previous version of this article included an incorrect statistic from the American-Israeli Cooperative Enterprise. The article also stated that most Palestinians consider the West Bank to be their rightful homeland. According to international law, it is their land. The article has been updated to reflect both changes. The Daily Trojan regrets the errors.

Thirteen of the 33 parents named in the alleged college admissions bribery scheme will appear in Boston Federal Court Wednesday. The announcement comes after an FBI investigation found that wealthy executives, celebrities and University officials had allegedly paid large sums of money to admit their students to elite universities under false pretenses. 
USC is at the forefront of the scandal, as the University admitted the highest number of students through bribes exchanged with former Senior Associate Athletics Director Donna Heinel and fake athletic profiles sent to the USC Office of Admission. 
The parents appearing in court are charged with conspiracy to commit fraud, according to documents obtained by the Daily Trojan. They are not expected to enter plea deals Wednesday, according to the Los Angeles Times. 
Actress Lori Loughlin and designer Mossimo Giannulli, parents of internet personality freshman Olivia Jade and sophomore Isabella Giannulli, are scheduled to appear in court for allegedly paying nearly $500,000 for University admission. Five other USC parents are also scheduled to appear.
At Friday’s hearing for 15 other parents involved in the case, many had their passports taken unless they were used for business purposes. 
At the hearing, TPG Growth founder Bill McGlashan, who talked with William “Rick” Singer — the college admissions counselor mastermind behind the alleged bribery scheme — about modifying an image of his son so that he could look like a football kicker to gain admission to USC, argued that he did not participate in the alleged scam. 
According to a court memorandum obtained by the Daily Trojan, McGlashan’s case is different from those of the other parents named in the investigation because his son was diagnosed with various learning disabilities when he was in eighth grade. The memorandum stated that McGlashan didn’t pay Singer for his son to become involved in the alleged admission scheme, and since his son is still completing high school, McGlashan withdrew his son’s college admissions.
Media executive Elisabeth Kimmel was charged with bribery to have her child admitted to  USC and did not enter a plea deal Friday after missing her first court appearance.
Laurie Levenson, a law professor at Loyola Marymount University, said it makes sense that defendants wouldn’t agree to plea deals until they’ve seen all the evidence from the prosecution. 
Levenson said she was surprised to see that Singer was offered a plea deal because of his central role in the scandal. She also said it is necessary for people to see full transcriptions of the phone calls and conversations between Singer and the parents. 
“The parents were wrong in what they did assuming they’re convicted, but the person who is sort of the predator here, the person who put this together and sort of preyed on the insecurity of these parents is Rick Singer,” Levenson said. 
Levenson said first-time offenders often face probationary sentences, but also added it is possible for the defendants to face jail time. While many people believe the defendants deserve to be punished because of their high statuses, Levenson said she thinks the public’s view of the parents will change once they appear in court and have the opportunity to present their cases. 
“By the time they get packaged and presented in court, what they’re going to be looking like are desperate parents,” Levenson said. “I think you will see a transformation from the initial outrage the public felt to saying, ‘There might be unfairness in the admissions process, but these people should not be the scapegoat for our general frustration.’”

The USC men’s basketball team recently added two new players to what looks like a talented class of newcomers in the 2019-20 season.
On Monday, USC announced the addition of graduate transfer guard Quinton Adlesh from Columbia University. Adlesh averaged the third-highest in points  and assists per game for the Lions in the 2018-19 season with 13.5 and 2.5, respectively.
Adlesh was one of many effective long-range shooters for Columbia, leading the team with 70 3-pointers made and shooting 37.2 percent from deep. Adlesh’s shooting prowess will likely be the main skill the USC coaching staff is looking for in the graduate student.
Adlesh announced his transfer by tweeting, “Excited to join @USC_Hoops next year! Can’t wait to be a part of the Trojan Family.”
On March 22, point guard Ethan Anderson tweeted his commitment to USC, adding to a freshman class ranked fourth in the country by 247 Sports. Anderson is a local product, having played at Fairfax High School, located about eight miles from USC.
Anderson is the sixth member of USC’s recruiting class and its second point guard, joining Georgia-native Kyle Sturdivant. Anderson earned a three-star rating and an overall grade of 87.43 from 247 Sports.
Although lacking elite size and athleticism, Anderson is a smart and quick player in a 6-foot-1, 195-pound frame and should add depth for USC at the point guard position. 
“Extremely blessed and honored to be 100% committed to the University of Southern California! I would like to thank the entire staff for believing in my God given talent and work ethic,” Anderson tweeted.
Although the addition of Anderson and Adlesh doesn’t fix the depth issues USC’s front court will face with the transfers of forwards freshman J’Raan Brooks and sophomore Victor Uyaelunmo, the pair will add competition at the backcourt spots.

The No. 6 USC men’s volleyball team will travel to Malibu to face No. 4 Pepperdine on Thursday night before hosting No. 5 UCLA at Galen Center for Senior Night on Saturday. 
	USC’s offense will be led by senior co-captains and outside hitters Ryan Moss and Jack Wyett. Moss and Wyett enter the match with a combined total of 560 kills on the season. They will be joined by fellow senior outside hitter Gianluca Grasso, who has tallied 211 kills this season.
	Sophomore middle blocker Sam Lewis will lead the USC defense. Lewis overcame a collapsed lung injury suffered in November to re-establish himself as one of the Trojans’ most instrumental pieces. He recently set a single-game personal record of seven blocks, and has collected 56 blocks so far this season. He will be accompanied by fellow sophomore middle blocker Kyle Gear with 36 blocks this season.
	Senior libero Matt Douglas and sophomore setter Chris Hall will fuel USC’s offense. Douglas has tallied 135 digs while Hall has aided his teammates with 693 assists this season.
USC’s record of already 15 wins and eight losses marks the best of any of the four seasons under the leadership of head coach Jeff Nygaard, and they have seen their rank climb dramatically over the course of the season. But despite all of the success that they have encountered this season, the Trojans remain humble and focused on the matches that lay ahead.
	“[This] week is a big week for us and we have a ton of respect for Pepperdine as a team,” Moss said. “They’re having a great year. So we’re going to train hard and get our bodies right, and go in there with the same mentality we’ve been bringing these past couple of weeks.”
	Part of that humility likely stems from the fact that the Trojans have gone 1-7 in opponents’ arenas this season, combined with the fact that the Waves are looking to avenge a loss at Galen Center in early March. The Trojans will have to overcome the odds to earn victory in their match on Thursday.
	The challenges they face won’t end there, however, as USC will host the UCLA Bruins for the final match of the regular season on Saturday. The last time these two teams faced one another was in Westwood, where the Bruins swept the Trojans in three sets.
	Since then, however, USC has won eight of its nine matches and taken down what was then considered the No. 1 team in the nation in Long Beach State in a convincing sweep. Additionally, the Trojans’ record at home remains perfect with 10 straight wins.
	Moss commented on how the team seems to have found its rhythm and overcome early struggles.
	“It took a while to figure it out… [but we have] had faith in ourselves all year,” he said.
Moss also spoke to how the team hopes to keep their recent trend of winning alive in these final matches of the season.
“We’ve definitely got some great momentum here,” he said. “UCLA, at home, on Senior Night, building into the playoffs… You couldn’t ask for anything better. We’ll be fired up and ready to go.”
The Trojans will face Pepperdine in Firestone Fieldhouse on Thursday at 7 p.m. and UCLA at Galen Center for Senior Night on Saturday at 7 p.m.

For many college students, four years of school can seem to fly by quickly. For student-athletes, grueling workouts, travel and the rigors of competing at the Division I level can make it go by even quicker. In this series, the Daily Trojan sits down with senior athletes playing various sports at USC to discuss their experience over the past four years, from their athletic life to their academic life. This week’s senior is Brandon Perez, an infielder on the baseball team who earned ACBA/Rawlings Gold Glove honors last season after posting a .987 fielding percentage.  
Q: What is your favorite memory at USC?
My favorite memory is probably just meeting a new group of guys every year, just creating a bond that is pretty special and that I will never forget after I leave this place. Playing UCLA at Dodger Stadium every year, my first few years playing UCLA at their place — those are pretty special memories.
Q: Do you have any regrets from the past four years?
No regrets at all. I’m very happy with my time here with USC baseball and at the school, so I have no regrets going forward. 
Q: What’s one thing about baseball that most people don’t know?
It definitely teaches you about failure. You fail way more times than you succeed in this sport, and that really translates into real life coming out of college. 
Q: What’s next for you?
Hopefully I can continue playing baseball after college, and if not, go into a career in real estate development. 
Q: Do you have any advice for freshman athletes?
I would definitely say just to enjoy every moment. It definitely goes by fast. Just to really reach out and put your name out there and create your own Trojan network. 
Q: What have you had to sacrifice in order to be a student-athlete? 
It’s definitely a year-round commitment. We’re starting right when we get to school and we go past even after school gets out. We’re constantly doing work on our vacations. A lot of blood, sweat and tears go into it, being [my] last season, but it’s definitely all worth it. 
Q: What is your schedule like?
I usually go to class during the day. Luckily, I’m a senior so I only have night classes. I have an internship right now that I’m going to during the day as well. I come back, go to practice, then to go lift and start all over again the next day. 
It’s definitely worth it. Just being around the guys, you’re around them more than your family. They start to become your second family, so it’s definitely worth it.

Dear President-elect Folt,
As I’m sure you know, the University of Southern California is known for its prestigious athletics program. Upon being admitted to USC, many students assumed they were entering a school that excelled in both academics and athletics. However, Trojan sports have not met their lofty expectations lately. 
The bottom line? USC Athletics needs an overhaul. 
Many alumni take pride in following their favorite Trojan sports teams. Many former Trojans still enjoy coming back to watch the football team play on game days. However, fans were left in shock as the football team finished below .500 on the year with a 5-7 record.
While it’s unrealistic to expect a replica of the early 2000s glory days, there is no excuse for this team to fall below .500. Not only has the Pac-12 conference been abysmal for the past few seasons, but also USC is the premier school that California-native recruits want to play for — or at least it used to be.
According to 247Sports, USC only managed to recruit two of California’s top 20 best players in 2019. There are a number of factors contributing to this besides USC’s disappointing season, but none more than how the program was handled in the offseason.
Many fans wanted to see head football coach Clay Helton fired after the football team’s disappointing year. Instead, Athletic Director Lynn Swann made the call to keep faith with his head coach and completely overhaul the program’s backroom staff. Some of these coaches were even recruiting players the night before they were fired.
Swann originally made a great hire by getting Kliff Kingsbury to join the Trojan family, but Kingsbury was overqualified to stay on as the offensive coordinator — hence why he became an NFL head coach within less than a month of his hiring. Had Kingsbury been offered the head coaching position at USC, it would have been much harder for him to withdraw his acceptance and leave the program.
Moreover, with the coach so in-demand, Swann should have negotiated a higher buyout than the reported $150,000 when signing Kingsbury. 
Losing Kingsbury caused a few recruits to decommit before National Signing Day. However, the biggest loss was California’s second-best prospect Bru McCoy, who did not want to join a program that looked so dysfunctional.
Additionally, other dollar-driving programs have been unsuccessful in recent seasons. Men’s basketball has been especially disappointing for the past two seasons. Two years ago, the team failed to meet expectations when it was ranked No. 10 before the season started but didn’t make the tournament. This season, the team missed the tournament again despite the Pac-12’s mediocrity.
The baseball program has also been a disappointment to the Trojan Family in recent years. In the past, despite the school’s tremendous success in football, some considered USC to be a baseball school due to its winning history. 
The Trojans have won 12 National Titles in baseball, twice as many as any other school. California is known for having great baseball talent, and USC is able to get the top baseball recruits in California. Yet, the team has not had a winning season since 2015 and is on track for another losing season this year. 
Unlike in football and basketball, however, the Pac-12 has remained strong in baseball and is getting even stronger. While USC is continuing to recruit very well, the team is not getting any better and is falling further behind other California programs like Stanford and UCLA.
Not only has the on-field success been disappointing over the past few years, but off the field, the USC athletic department has been a mess.
As everyone is aware, USC played a big role in the college admissions scandal — no other school had as many “athletes” involved in the scandal. Moreover, no other school had such a high profile senior official in their athletics department charged in the case.
In a business, some operations understandably fly under the radar. However, for something so big to go under the radar for so long is disgraceful. Swann said he had no knowledge of what some of his staff members were doing. If this is true, then Swann clearly had no control of what was taking place in his athletic department and therefore has no business being in charge of a program he cannot oversee properly. 
Lastly, the athletic department has not been transparent with its students or the student media. When reaching out to USC Athletics for information about the scandal, students are redirected by the department to the University’s statement regarding the situation instead of making their own statement about the events.
Swann himself has declined to face members of the student media on multiple occasions, instead opting to conduct interviews with bigger publications. Rather than owning up to the wrongdoings of the department in front of the school and its media, the department has decided to lay low and prevent coaches, players or anyone affiliated with Athletics to speak on the matter.
Finally, on April 2, Swann released a press release defending himself after a Los Angeles Times editorial criticized him. While he did not admit to mistakes, he did acknowledge that the department is continuing to learn and is trying to solve problems.
USC Athletics has not fulfilled the University’s goal of increasing transparency, and has not owned up to its mistakes despite multiple opportunities to do so.
In the past year, the athletic department’s mismanagement has become clear. 
While success on the field is important, fans should accept that not every year will be a good one. However, not only have USC’s teams been subpar this year, but its athletic leadership has shown an ineptitude to make the right decisions and oversee everything that is taking place within it. This calls for an overhaul.
President-elect Folt, if you are reading this, I hope you take this under consideration when you begin your term this summer. Instead of making headlines for its scandals, the Cardinal and Gold should be in the headlines due to positive results on the field and winning trophies.

The Carson Television Center was set ablaze with scalding swing and fiery funk Monday night as the Thornton Jazz Orchestra and Grammy Award-winning jazz fusion group Yellowjackets took the stage in a special night of performances. The concert was aimed at welcoming drummer Will Kennedy to the Thornton School of Music faculty. 
The Michael Stever Combo, comprising Thornton jazz student, kicked off the night with a variety of original compositions, as well as an arrangement of David Bowie’s “I’m Afraid of Americans” by combo leader and Thornton alumnus Michael Stever.
Immediately following Stever’s opener, the critically acclaimed Yellowjackets took the stage — Thornton Jazz Studies chair Bob Mintzer (saxophone), professor Russell Ferrante (piano and keyboards), bassist Dane Alderson and Will Kennedy on drums. 
Kennedy was selected this school year to fill the vacancy of the late Ndugu Chancler on Thornton’s drum faculty. Yellowjackets’ blazing five-song set featured a wide array of jazz-inspired styles and showcased Kennedy’s expert conversational groove to an enthralled and at-capacity Carson Center. 
Yellowjackets joined the Thornton Jazz Orchestra onstage to end the night, performing big-band renditions of Yellowjackets originals in an exceptional collaborative display of musicianship. 
Among these renditions were “Downtown,” an uptempo swing arrangement filled with intricate staccato horn melodies and a wailing solo by trumpet student Aaron Janik; and “Civil War,” a steady funk arrangement with soulful, wildly fluctuating sax lines featuring a notable solo from tenor saxophone student Andrew Torgelson. Fittingly, the evening reached a climax with a thundering drum solo by Kennedy during “Run For Your Life,” bringing the entire audience — including Thornton Dean Robert Cutietta and Interim President Wanda  Austin — to its feet with roaring applause. 
The final set was an impressive display of the musical chops, dynamic sensitivity and improvisational prowess of TJO’s three horn sections, accompanied by the world-class expertise of its faculty performers. Before concluding, Mintzer made sure to thank TJO’s student rhythm section for conceding their seats to Yellowjackets for the evening.
Monday night’s jazz performances offered listeners a unique glimpse into the immense talent bursting within the walls of USC Thornton’s classrooms.

The Daily Trojan sat down with Soraya Alizadeh, an avid singer-songwriter and pop performer. Alizadeh is also a senior majoring in public relations at the Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism and minoring in music industry.
Daily Trojan: You write and create your own music. For those who haven’t heard your work, how would you describe it?
Soraya Alizadeh: That’s the million-dollar question. I would say that it’s a mixture of Alina Baraz, Lorde and Joni Mitchell. That’s the type of music that I like to sing and write.
DT: What is your main inspiration for writing?
SA: Growing up, I would write senseless songs just because I enjoyed coming up with melodies and lyrics, but as I grew older and had more life experiences, I started to base the writing processes more on those. I’d say I’m a very candid, open book, and I don’t like to hide anything from anybody. I speak to a bunch of different things I’ve experienced: Heartbreak, being raised by a single mom and not having the best relationship with my dad. 	
On the more lighthearted side, I’d say the most attractive part of writing a song is coming up with the melodies. That’s always been the case ever since I was three. It really depends if I’m writing alone or writing with somebody else. Even if it’s just on my own, it really depends on the day.
DT: Who have you collaborated with before?
SA: On the artist side, the first single I ever released was actually a collaboration with [electronic artist] Beshken. That was really the first thing that I released; that was when I was 16, and it was the most serious I’d done. It wasn’t just something I’d written and recorded for friends or people in smaller circles. That was actually when I started to get more interested in taking music seriously. 
I’ve also collaborated with other people like Kap Slap, and on the songwriter front and the producer side, the most influential people in my songwriter and artist career would be Spike Stent, Harry and Steve Kipner and Andrew Frampton. I would say those people have provided me with the most support and confidence in my songwriter and performing abilities. They really taught me a lot about how to best approach the music industry. 
DT: Which artists are your main inspirations?
SA: Whitney Houston is by far my No. 1 main inspiration. Joni Mitchell, Carole King, more recently Ariana Grande, Aretha Franklin and Elton John are some others, too. They’re artists who really care about the actual art itself, and they represent the creative side to the music industry that, in recent years, hasn’t really been the main focus. All the artists I’ve mentioned were purely in it for their passion for singing and performing. They were really interested in learning and being able to be criticized about their art. It wasn’t just, “Oh, I’m so famous!” but more about the creativity and the heart. That’s what I’m doing this for.
DT: Do you have a favorite song of yours? Why is it your favorite?
SA: When I was 17, I wrote a song called “You Mean Nothing to Me,” and it was about my dad. I’ve been very open about him in my songwriting. My dad isn’t really involved in my life, and he’s very vocal about that choice, so growing up with that was something that I struggled with. That was the first song I felt very emotionally invested in, as opposed to before when I would just write about things like summer or whatever was catchy, things that would focus more on the melody. I think that was the turning point for me to a certain degree: I realized that, as a singer-songwriter, it was important to talk about emotionally charged things in music if that’s something I was feeling. 
DT: What do you like to do when you aren’t producing music?
SA: I love to cook and I love to travel. I’m very extroverted so I love being around people, but I also enjoy being on my own and zoning in on my work. I’m very much the kind of person who always has to be working, and that doesn’t bother me, like, I’m never just sitting around doing nothing.

In 1954, the image of an aquatic monsterman bearing aloft a prostrate woman in a scene from the horror film “Creature from the Black Lagoon” thrilled and titillated moviegoing audiences. Sixty-four years later, the movie posters promoting Guillermo del Toro’s “The Shape of Water” drew heavily from the same premise: a human woman in the arms of a piscine-humanoid beast, albeit in a decidedly more consensual embrace. 
But there was perhaps another inspiration for del Toro’s Best Picture winner, one that flew under the collective radar: Rachel Ingalls’ 1982 novel “Mrs. Caliban.” 
At first glance, “Mrs. Caliban” appears to occupy thoroughly-trodden territory: Bored housewife Dorothy, trapped in a loveless marriage to her philandering husband, finds solace in the arms of an amphibious 6-foot-7 creature who has escaped from the Institute for Oceanographic Research. He is on the lam, having killed two scientists in order to flee their abusive treatment, and he needs a place to lie low before he attempts to make his way back home to the Gulf of Mexico. 
The creature has given himself the humorously prosaic name “Larry,” at odds with his bizarre appearance, and just so happens to stumble into Dorothy’s nice, safe, linoleum-checked kitchen. Instead of alerting the authorities, she decides to feed and clothe him under the nose of her oblivious husband, who’s too busy attending “business meetings” to notice anything amiss. Larry is polite and cultured and — ahem — well-endowed, and it’s not long before Dorothy and Larry proceed to “[make] love on the living-room floor and on the dining-room sofa and sitting in the kitchen chairs and upstairs in the bathtub. And they talked.”
There’s evidence that suggests Larry is merely a figment of Dorothy’s imagination — at the start of the book, she mentions how she keeps hearing things that “couldn’t possibly be real,” announcements on the radio addressed directly to her. The multitude of ambiguities in the book — whether Dorothy is in her right mind or not; whether she should be cheating on her husband; whether she should continue harboring a fugitive or turn him in — serve to establish her as a complex, flawed female protagonist. 
But, of course, all good things must come to an end. Unbeknownst to Dorothy, Larry, her husband and her best friend Estelle are hurtling along on a collision course, and at the end of the book they come crashing together in spectacular fashion. I don’t want to spoil anything, but suffice to say that Ingalls is liberal with her body count. 
All her life, Ingalls’ body of work languished in relative obscurity. “Mrs. Caliban” enjoyed a brief spike in interest when, in 1986, the British Book Marketing Council named it one of the 20 greatest American novels since World War II. It has garnered praise from prominent authors Ursula Le Guin, Joyce Carol Oates and John Updike, who declared the slim volume “an impeccable parable.” In 2017, “The Shape of Water” elicited a flurry of belated book reviews in NPR, Vanity Fair and the Los Angeles Times. Sadly, Ingalls died in early March, just as her writing began gaining greater traction. 
“Mrs. Caliban” takes an old, worn-out trope — lonely housewife in need of a distraction — and spins it into a riveting story that left me struggling to catch my breath, especially when developments begin ensuing one after another like a 10-car pile-up. 
Ingalls’ prose is clear and caustic; she writes with purposeful assuredness, with a feminist flair far ahead of her time. It’s about time she gets her posthumous due.

The USC Interfraternity Council writes to address the March 26 Daily Trojan article titled “As USC works to raise its national profile, fraternities are on the chopping block.” IFC commends the Daily Trojan for raising awareness of the issue of hazing on college campuses. Furthermore, we reaffirm investigative action related to hazing as we work  with the University on hazing prevention initiatives. 
IFC collaborates with the Office of Fraternity & Sorority Leadership Development as well as the Office of Student Affairs on this issue. We encourage editorial staff and readers to refer to a Student Affairs memorandum published in the March 20 issue of the Daily Trojan. This memorandum, entitled “USC Fraternity & Sorority Safety Priorities 2019 – 2020,” outlines action items with these offices on topics such as hazing prevention and new member education. 
Journalists are responsible for delivering the verifiable truth to the public. The Daily Trojan article, however, contains bias and reporting inaccuracies. The article’s opening paragraph describes a narrative rather than a reported scene of events. This paragraph begins a trend of unsubstantiated blanket statements throughout the article, such as broad descriptions of alleged hazing acts from all IFC chapters. 
Misleading language can cause confusion. The article section titled “Current allegations” does not outline any current allegations. No IFC chapter is currently placed on interim suspension, with all previous cases described in the article now closed. Hazing practices do not align with the vision for fraternities at USC, and the current IFC judicial status reflects this culture. 
Incendiary, emotionally charged words further cloud the truth. IFC meets regularly with Student Affairs to discuss actionable goals for our improvement. The Daily Trojan article quotes heavily from Dr. Ainsley Carry, the University’s outgoing vice president for student affairs. Per the March 20 Safety Priorities memorandum, Carry writes that “USC values the fraternity and sorority community and is committed to its future.” The relationship between IFC and the University is one of mutual respect — not a “chopping block.” 
Thorough, unbiased journalism both educates the public at large and holds various communities accountable. We support these practices and encourage the Daily Trojan to uphold them.

I often wonder what it’s like to meet a diversity quota as a writer for a television show — to be stuck in the situation of needing to appear racially progressive for ratings, but never actually commit. I imagine it’s a bit like recruiting for a college admissions pamphlet; you place a black male here, an Asian female here, and have them sit right next to the beaming white male who’s delighted to be surrounded by his multi-ethnic friends. A picture-perfect advertisement, letting prospective white students know that despite the fact that 70% of students who matriculate are white, they’re still getting a multicultural college experience before settling back into the white-dominated workforce. 
Letting my mind wander around my imaginary diversity casting room, I suddenly see it: There I am, a white male, sitting at a table, dimly lit by fluorescent lights. Next to me are all of my fellow white male colleagues. We bounce ideas off each other while the single face of diversity, an intern, of course, is fetching us coffee. 
“How about if the main character briefly expresses romantic interest in a black guy before falling in love with the actual, white love interest?” someone asks. Nope, too far-fetched. That would never happen. “How about if her best friend has an Asian boyfriend?” another voice inquires. “Hmm,” I think to myself. “That could work.”
“We could even cast Henry Golding for the role — imagine the exposure!” someone says, mirroring my sentiments. Murmurs of agreement echo around the table. It’s perfect — just enough diversity to invite congratulatory pats on the back for having representation at all, but not enough to completely turn off the white consumer base so vital to the entertainment industry. 
The perfect formula? It’s fine to create a diverse cast, but not too diverse. We don’t want to be accused of pandering. That would be the absolute worst thing to happen to this show.
Snapping back to reality, I open my laptop and start to peruse television shows online. I see a trailer for a new Netflix show, aptly titled “Special.” Apparently, it’s the life story of a gay white man suffering from cerebral palsy. Definitely an interesting premise, I think to myself as I watch the trailer. Soon enough, his best friend — a larger south Asian woman — appears to be his faithful sidekick, her presence in the show devoted to boosting the main character’s self-esteem as well as bringing slight awareness to issues of colorism and body shaming. It then quickly switches back to the main character’s plight of how hard it is to date other gay, white, able-bodied men. Hmm.
Finishing the trailer, I’m redirected to a recurring train of thought — the diversity quota. The social issues quota. The fact that once again, it’s the “friend,” the “sidekick,” the “other” character that shoulders the weight of being the face of color in the show, alongside being a vehicle to tackle other mainstream social issues. Because of course, these are issues we want to address — but not at the cost of forgoing the white illusion. We need the white audience to be able to relate with the character, to sympathize — and how on earth can they do that if he’s not white? How can they do that if his dating struggles aren’t exclusive to dating other white guys? 
It’s a trope we see over and over and over again, but for the sake of brevity, I’m going to stick to Asian male representation in television. We see it in “13 Reasons Why,” where an Asian guy (Ross Butler) plays a football jock. (A side character breaking traditional stereotypes, whoa!) But of course the main character and his love interest are both white — casting can’t go too far outside the racial norm. We see it in “Grey’s Anatomy,” where Alex Landi plays the attractive Asian doctor, who promptly begins hooking up with the shy, nerdy white guy. This representation itself reinforces problematic stereotypes of interracial relationships between Asian and white men relations in the gay community, but I digress. Hell, we see it in Oliver Hampton (Conrad Ricamora) in “How to Get Away With Murder,” where racism in the gay community is just ever so slightly brushed upon. Note that I wasn’t even intentionally listing half-Asian actors but … there we have it.
TV shows act as a lightning rod for sparking conversations about diversity, depicting glimpses of representation — enough to spawn viral articles online about the miniscule screen time these actors are given, but not enough to create actual fleshed out characters. It’s a safe distance — easy enough to access for some favorable press, but promptly discarded when no longer necessary. 
I don’t like being taken for a fool. And these shows are not kidding me. No, I am not happy to “be seeing any representation at all.” Because in the end, what these shows are doing is nothing more than exploitation. This sort of shallow representation can only make me think of white Hollywood, waving some bait above our heads and laughing as we bite. Reaping the rewards of their lack of commitment, seeing us foam at our mouths when given even the tiniest bit of diversity. 
Looking forward, I can only hope. I hope that one day, I’ll watch a trailer where the main character is an Asian American, created not for the sake of diversity, but because stories about Asian people are compelling without a hidden agenda.
Hell, while I’m dreaming, might as well throw in a white side character while I’m at it. Now that would be what I call diverse casting.
