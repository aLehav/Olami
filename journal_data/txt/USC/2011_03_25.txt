In the final home games of the season, the USC student section would chant “one more year,” imploring junior forward Nikola Vucevic to return for his senior season.
In a press conference at the Galen Center Friday afternoon, Vucevic announced that he would, instead, declare for the NBA draft, and sign with an agent, Rade Filipovich of BDA Sports Management, meaning that he is forfeiting the rest of his collegiate eligibility.
“It was a tough decision,” Vucevic said. “I thought that if I came back we could have done a lot of good stuff, but at the same time, I wanted to take the next step in my life.”
Had Vucevic not signed with an agent, he would have had until May 8 to withdraw his name and return to college for his senior season.
“I feel like if you do something, you have to go into it 100 percent,” Vucevic said. “It is a lot easier when you have somebody who can take care of the scheduling part.”
Vucevic said that he plans to continue taking classes this semester while preparing for the NBA draft, and to take summer school so that he can eventually graduate.
“I am not thinking about where I am going to be drafted,” Vucevic said. “I just want to do my best at the workouts and impress people.”
This past season, the 6-foot-10 Vucevic averaged 17.1 points and 10.3 rebounds per game, and was named to the All-Pac-10 First-Team. He had a double-double in his final eight regular season Pac-10 games.
Vucevic was the leading scorer and rebounder for the Trojans, who lost to Virginia Commonwealth in the first round of the NCAA tournament.
“Nikola’s great advantage is that he is going to be able to guard [NBA power forwards and centers], which very few people can do,” said USC coach Kevin O’Neill. “He is going to have to become an NBA three-point shooter. The lines on an NBA court are considerably longer, and it is a huge adjustment.”
With forward Alex Stepheson set to graduate, USC will have an inexperienced frontcourt next season. The Trojans’ post rotation will include transfers James Blasczyk, DeWayne Dedmon and Aaron Fuller, as well as Curtis Washington, who played sparingly as a freshman.
“Curtis is a lot like me when I was a freshman,” Vucevic said. “He is a young guy who works really hard everyday. He is one of the guys who works the hardest on the team.”
O’Neill said that he plans to recruit one or maybe two new players.
“When you lose a guy like [Vucevic], obviously it is going to be a blow to you,” O’Neill said. “It is our job with the guys coming in, and whoever else we end up signing in the late period, to make sure that we have a team that can be competitive in the Pac-10 and get into the postseason.”

Following a trip to Hawai’i for a series of matchups, the No. 3 USC women’s water polo team returns to the mainland for a pair of nonconference clashes, headlined by Friday’s matchup against No. 20 Maryland at McDonald Swim Stadium.
The Women of Troy (12-3, 2-1) last faced the Terrapins over a decage ago, and even with a lack of familiarity, the team remains excited for its matchup before its big game Saturday against Loyola Marymount.
“A game is a game,” said senior two-meter Sarah Van Norman. “We’re going to be ready for Maryland and it’s definitely going to get us ready for LMU on Saturday.”
No. 20 Maryland comes to Southern California winless against USC. The last contest between the two teams was in 1998, which USC won in overtime, 8-7, in the Pomona Tournament and 4-2 in a nonconference matchup.
Although the Women of Troy have to get through Maryland Friday, they remain focused on Saturday’s contest against No. 6 LMU, who has given other highly ranked conference teams a run for their money.
“I mean conference or not we still take the games pretty seriously because we have to take each game as it comes,” said junior driver Nadia Dan. “LMU is a pretty good team and they’ve given teams in our conference good games. They gave UCLA and Hawai’i a tough match. It’s not going to be an easy game so we’re going to practice like they are in our conference.”
The Women of Troy have to be careful on Saturday against LMU, who boasts a 16-4 record and is coming off six straight wins in a row. Although USC is 19-0 all time against LMU, the team still realizes that they need to focus and compete for the entire game on Saturday in order to secure a victory.
A lot of the team focus lately has been in uniting in order to compete at a higher level in the water. Coming off of last week’s MPSF victory in Hawai’i, the team feels a lot better about their chemistry.
“I think Hawaii always brings out team together” Van Norman said. “I don’t know, maybe it’s the different scenery or what but definitely that win in Hawaii really made us feel great, and hopefully that lasts for the rest of the season.”
The Women of Troy are also still confident in their newcomers. Freshman goalie Flora Bolonyai is still making a huge impact, and she earned third pick as the MPSF Newcomer of the Week. This brings high team confidence, and hopefully this will carry through the season to earn the Women of Troy yet another national championship.
