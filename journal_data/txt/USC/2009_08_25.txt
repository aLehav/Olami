In an effort to decrease property theft around campus, the USC Department of Public Safety has begun enforcing bike parking regulations and will be impounding bikes parked in violation of those rules.
In a university-wide e-mail last week, DPS wrote that more than 95 percent of bike thefts occur when bikes are left unsecured to bike racks. To decrease the number of thefts, DPS will be impounding bikes not secured to official racks.

“The rules have always been there and we have such a high number of stolen bicycles,” said Capt. Antonia Young from DPS Crime Prevention. “We’re going to impound bikes so they don’t get stolen.”
Retrieving an impounded bike will cost $20, if the owner has registered the bike. Owners who have not registered their bike with DPS — a mandatory process that costs $3 — will find it extremely difficult to recover an impounded bike, Young said.
The bike registration process is critical for another reason, too: it helps DPS determine how many racks to place on campus.
Many students said their main concern, in light of DPS’s move to enforce bike rack policies, was the insufficient rack space on campus. Young, however, said there are enough bike racks on USC property to store all bikes registered with DPS. She added that if the number of registered bikes showed there were not enough bike racks, DPS would not hesitate to contact USC Facilities Management Services and advocate for more racks.
Students remain concerned, though, that with the current number of racks on campus, locking their bikes will be a difficult task. Many students said the bike parking policy seems fair, but the limited rack space on campus might prevent them from properly securing their bikes.
“There’s not enough racks,” said Jessica Lam, a sophomore majoring in environmental engineering major. “For example, in Cardinal [Gardens] there’s just this one line of racks for several buildings to share.”
Lam, who had her bike impounded twice in the last year, said if there had been racks available, she would have used them.
DPS Capt. David Carlisle said if a rack is full, students should consider locking their bikes to a different rack in the area.
“Students would need to walk just a little bit farther to find a bike rack,” Carlisle said. “Sometimes there are available racks, but students consider them inconvenient to use.”
Young noted that using a rack farther away is still less inconvenient than having a bike stolen or impounded.
Still, Lam and others said leaving their bikes at a different rack is not always an option.
“Sometimes you just don’t have time to find another rack farther away, especially when you’re going to class and you can’t be late,” Lam said.
Though the initiative aims not to inconvenience students, but to discourage further bike theft, Rick Vranish, a sophomore majoring in business administration and cinema, said he felt there were more effective ways to reduce thefts.
“If someone’s carrying a bicycle out that has a chain on the tire, stop them,” said Vranish, who had his bike stolen from outside Birnkrant Residential College. “Keep people off campus who don’t belong here.”

Students walking through the North University Park area will notice a new fixture on the sidewalks this week -— 22 patrolling security guards in bright yellow jackets.
The university has hired Contemporary Services Corporation to monitor the area, stationing guards at fixed locations in the North University Park area. The USC Department of Public Safety hopes the CSC security ambassadors will help make the area feel safer.

“What we’re trying to do is increase the perception of safety in the community, not necessarily decrease crime,” said DPS Chief Carey Drayton. “It’s hard to get the message across that it’s a safe community. Crime has been going down for the past three years but that means nothing if you only see the negative things and you only believe that’s what can happen to you so we need something that can improve the perception of safety.”
DPS Capt. David Carlisle agreed the security ambassadors are an important component in helping students feel safe around campus.
“They will act as an additional community resource to create a sense of well being and security,” said USC Department of Public Safety Capt. David Carlisle.
The security ambassadors will not actually handle crimes, Drayton said, but they can report crimes either to their supervisor via radio or directly to LAPD.
“It’s simple,” Drayton said. “Their main responsibility is to observe and report.”
Charlie Lane, associate senior vice president of USC Career and Protective Services, said he thought the security ambassadors could actually help decrease crime rates, in addition to creating an atmosphere of greater safety.
Lane said the university decided to employ CSC because, although crime is down, there’s still room for improvement to campus safety.
“Due to a number of different factors, we still experience crime in and around our campuses and know that we remain vulnerable to it,” Lane said.  “Consequently ,during the summer months, we took additional measures to ensure that the University Park campus is made as safe as possible, and that crime continues to decline.”
Drayton said hiring private security officers was an easier solution than employing additional DPS officers, particularly in light of the university-wide hiring freeze.
Hiring and training 22 DPS officers would be a large undertaking, Drayton said, and was one the university didn’t think was worth pursuing, given the option of hiring a private security force.
“Getting 22 people all hired and trained and outfitted is not easy to do in a three-month period,” Drayton said. “That’s number one. Number two, the university does have a hiring freeze right now. And given the option of bringing on 22 full-time people or hiring someone from the outside, the decision was very easy hiring someone from the outside to see how this plays out.”
Though more efficient than hiring more DPS officers, Drayton admitted hiring CSC personnel was a large investment — DPS would not disclose the exact cost. Still, Carlisle said, the investment is worthwhile if it helps students feel safe.
Many students said the security ambassador program does make them feel safer.
“I like it because, if they’re stationary, then I’ll know if I have to run somewhere, that’s where I’m running,” said Summer Lindman, a senior majoring in vocal arts.

Playing the seventh-ranked team in the nation in front of an opposing crowd of more than 2,700, the No. 8 USC women’s soccer team wilted in the Texas heat, losing their season opener 3-0 to Texas A&M on Saturday in College Station.
With temperatures at kickoff hovering in the mid 90s and humidity around 40 percent, the Women of Troy started strong by creating several good opportunities in the first half. However, they were unable to capitalize and the game turned in the Aggies’ favor near the end of the opening period.
Not this time · Goalkeeper Kristin Olsen, pictured here making a save last season, was not so fortunate Saturday against the Aggies. - Pierson Clair | USC Sports Information 
Freshman midfielder Mary Grace Schmidt gave the Aggies the lead with only 22 seconds to go in the first half when she headed sophomore Becca Herrera’s corner kick past USC goalkeeper senior Kristin Olsen. Junior forward Whitney Hooper doubled the lead in the 73rd minute, capitalizing on a bad pass by the USC defense by sliding the ball inside the far post past a diving Olsen. In the 87th minute, with Olsen caught more than 30 yards upfield, senior Amber Gnatzig beat redshirt senior Meagan Holmes to a loose ball and shot it into an open net to complete the score line.
“I just think the whole thing was a bit much for us the first time out, playing such a good team and in such a hostile environment,” USC coach Ali Khosroshahin said. “You’ve got to give A&M a lot of credit for the pressure they put us under and they forced us to make some mistakes.”
The Women of Troy were the ones applying the pressure in the opening 30 minutes. Junior forward Megan Ohai forced A&M keeper Kristin Arnold to make two saves in the early going, including one from point blank range in the 13th minute.
Fifth-year midfielder Marihelen Tomer also had a great chance to give USC the lead in the 15th minute, but put her shot wide of the far post. The best chance of the game for the Women of Troy came in the 34th minute when junior midfielder Ashli Sandoval cracked a shot from the top of the 18-yard box off of the crossbar.
“We had some clear chances in the first half that if we put away early on, it’s a completely different game,” Khosroshahin said.
Buoyed by their vocal crowd, the Aggies began to take control of the game in the final five minutes of the first half. Freshman forward Kim Castleberry and junior midfielder Rachel Shipley forced Olsen to make two saves, followed quickly by the opening goal.
“The ball kind of slid out and I got tripped by one of the Texas A&M players,” Olsen said. “There was a girl open at the back post and we didn’t match up well on that and she was able to head it into the back of the net.”
The second half was almost completely dominated by the Aggies. They extended their lead to 2-0 in the 73rd minute when a bad pass by a USC defender was turned into a goal by the speedy Hooper. Nora Skelton intercepted the pass and played a nice through ball for Hooper, who beat Olsen for the score.
The defeat could have been much worse for the Women of Troy had it not been for Olsen, who made five of her eight saves in the second half. In one sequence in the 83rd minute, Olsen made a diving save on a Castleberry shot and was able to punch away the follow-up attempt by Hooper with one hand from her knees.
Olsen was, however, caught out near the midfield line in the 87th minute and her attempted clear was headed by a Texas A&M player onto the path of Gnatzig, who found the empty net for the game’s final goal.
If there was a bright spot to the opening match, it was the fact that three USC players earned their first career starts and three freshmen played in their first match for the Women of Troy.
“The first game is always rough, especially with new players coming in,” Olsen said. “If we’re going to lose 3-0, we might as well do it at the beginning of the season because we can learn from it.”
“The mistakes we made [Saturday], we don’t make those type of mistakes,” Khosroshahin added. “Those are things we’ll be able to correct.”
The Women of Troy are in action this Friday at McAlister Field against the Mexican national team in an exhibition match.

Freshman quarterback Matt Barkley dropped back during a team scrimmage Saturday and lobbed a pass over the middle to a streaking receiver. The throw elicited a momentary roar of approval from the crowd that died out after the receiver bobbled the pass.
In a scrimmage punctuated by hard hits and dropped passes, Barkley played a role in many of the best plays on the offensive side of the ball while his counterpart, redshirt sophomore Aaron Corp, stood on the sidelines and watched, his left knee secured in a brace and elastic sleeve.
On his way · Corp says he feels good enough to return to practice. - Nathaniel Gonzalez | Daily Trojan
Corp suffered a small crack in his left fibula two weeks ago that has since kept him from participating fully in practice. The injury further muddled the picture at quarterback, where Corp and Barkley have been battling for the starting spot.
Corp entered fall camp as the starter, but his injury and Barkley’s steady improvement have reopened the question of who will start Sept. 5 in the season opener against San Jose State.
Head coach Pete Carroll said Friday that Corp needed to be practicing full speed by Tuesday if he wanted a chance to start the season opener. Corp got a head start on that deadline by sneaking into a series of plays during the Saturday morning practice.
“I think it was against the trainer’s [orders] but Coach let me go,” Corp said. “It felt fine.”
Despite missing almost two weeks, Corp said he did not expect the time off to affect his readiness for the Trojans’ first game.
“I think I’ll be ready,” he said. “I gotta play well when I come back and practice. We get one more scrimmage on Saturday and then we’re into game preparation.”
The status of Corp’s knee is commanding most of the attention around the team these days, but several other key members have also gone down with injuries. Junior center Kristofer O’Dowd, a mainstay on the offensive line since his arrival on campus three years ago, is questionable for the season opener after he dislocated his right kneecap during a scrimmage two weeks ago at the Coliseum.
O’Dowd said his personal goal was to be back on the field as soon as his body would allow, but wants to make sure his knee is healthy. If he is unable to play by the San Jose State game, senior offensive guard Alex Parsons will likely start at center.  Parsons started 10 games at right guard last season for USC and has taken the first-team snaps in O’Dowd’s absence.
O’Dowd said it wouldn’t take the rest of the offensive line long to adjust to a new center.
“We’ve all been together so long,” O’Dowd said. “It’s not so much a matter of miscommunication as a different tone [in the huddle].”
Preseason injuries have not been limited to the offensive side of the ball. Incoming freshman linebacker Frankie Telfort’s promising career at USC ended before it began this summer when tests revealed the highly touted freshman had a genetic heart condition. Telfort was expected to help fill the void at linebacker left by the departures of Brian Cushing, Clay Matthews, Rey Maualuga and Kaluka Maiava.
The defensive line was also expected to help USC adjust to life without its departed linebackers, but the unit suddenly has two holes to fill.
Redshirt senior Averell Spicer, a presumptive starter at defensive tackle, sprained his ankle during fall camp and will be out for at least another one to two weeks. Sophomore defensive end Armond Armstead broke his foot last week after safety Shane Horton stepped on it. Armstead, who has already had surgery, is expected to miss six to eight weeks.
Despite the loss of two potential starters on the defensive line, Spicer does not expect the unit to miss a beat.
“Our D-line is just stacked with talent,” Spicer said. “Even now we don’t know who the starters are going to be. It’s not like we don’t have guys who can play.”
Junior Hebron Fangupo, a transfer from Mt. San Antonio JC, is a favorite to fill in for Spicer at the tackle spot, while sophomore Malik Jackson will look to pick up the slack for Armstead at end.

With time to kill before “Salute to Troy” and fall camp wrapping up, a horde of freshmen and their parents flocked to Howard Jones Field on Saturday to catch a glimpse of this football team everyone’s been making such a fuss about.
There were the diehards who could spot any player, even the incoming freshmen, and recite their name immediately. But many in attendance were armed with rosters, a helpful aid in answering an important question.
Who are these guys?
The offensive players are more easy and fun to point out. There’s the freshman wunderkind vying for the starting quarterback position, his lanky competition waiting to get healthy and back in the race and the speedy tailback waiting for a breakout junior season.
Putting a face on the defense, however, proved at times more difficult — unless it was senior Taylor Mays.
As the lone player on USC’s media guide and perhaps the most recognizable member of the team, it would be easy to reduce USC’s defense to Mays. But Pete Carroll’s units have always transcended being about one star. It’s a collective effort that requires collaboration to establish a group dynamic.
And if you asked most fans strolling by Tommy Trojan to name a starter on defense other than Mays, I’d bet that you’d get quizzical looks and a few responses asking whether Rey Maualuga still had any eligibility left.
It’s not for a lack of talent that the unit’s individual players aren’t as recognizable as their predecessors ­— of the projected starters, only redshirt senior Josh Pinkard was rated lower than a four-star prospect coming out of high school, and he’s more than outplayed that ranking.
But even when many of these players were playing important roles as spot players last year, they had players like Maualuga, Brian Cushing and Kevin Ellison to set the tone. Those players ultimately molded the defense in their own image.
Almost all of the players have shown flashes in fall camp, if not games themselves. But most fans aren’t diehard enough to analyze fourth-quarter blowouts and spring scrimmages, so they can be forgiven if the first thing that pops to mind when they think of junior Malcolm Smith is still “Steve Smith’s brother” instead of “starting weakside linebacker.”
Head coach Pete Carroll is the ultimate sculptor in all of this, as he is the mastermind behind how the defense will look. But the appearance is somewhat fluid and depends on the players. Carroll was so enamored with how aggressive the defense was last year that he began opining about downplaying the importance of reducing penalties so long as the Trojans could keep points off the board.
Getting a handle on what this group will be like is hard given that we’ve only seen bits and pieces, but if Saturday’s scrimmage was any indication, the Trojans’ defense once again has plenty of swagger, and reason for it.
The only points scored on the day came courtesy of a safety — linebacker Shane Horton leveled tailback Curtis McNeal in the backfield — and the defense recorded six sacks. With each stop, the defense got more amped up, hooting and hollering along the way.
“It was game-like with the way they were running and hitting out there,” Carroll said, while still scolding the offense for their various shortcomings throughout the day.
It may be unfair to crown the defense kings of camp after the performance given the offensive players that were out for the day (redshirt sophomore Aaron Corp, redshirt junior Damian Williams, redshirt senior Charles Brown and redshirt junior Allen Bradford all sat out). But it’s clear that the unit is ahead of the curve.
If confidence is one facet of the new defense’s personality, then composure will have to be another. Carroll’s units have been about being in the right place at the right time more than about backbreaking plays, and this defense will have to follow suit. With a full house guaranteed for Ohio State and fans screaming like they were trying to cause seismic activity in Michigan, USC will have to know where to be without much communication.
If the defense isn’t up to the early test of character, the Buckeyes could find their opening. While still not an advanced passer, sophomore quarterback Terrelle Pryor is a big enough threat running the ball that he can make USC pay the same way Dennis Dixon did in 2007.
The defense does not have to reinvent the wheel when carving out its niche. Mays and Carroll are obsessed with USC history and spoke of the school’s past great defenders at Pac-10 media day almost as much as they talked about current members of the team. If the team can maintain the steady level of elite play that has been a hallmark of USC defenses under Carroll, he won’t care what the public’s image of the group is.
No matter what, though, the group will have four months to make their presence known around campus as well as on the field.

Few of the souvenirs that Kevin O’Neill collected in his many coaching stops have made it to his office in the Galen Center.
Instead, their charred remains might be lying in a pit somewhere in upstate New York.
The bonfires back East consist of O’Neill burning his clothes from previous jobs, a ceremony he has thrown on multiple occasions. For a coach who has been constantly on the move, it is a symbolic way of purging the past.

“The point of it is that when you’re in a new job, you should forget about other jobs you’ve had,” O’Neill said.
O’Neill is looking for a new beginning after making stops with seven different NBA and college teams over the past decade. But the man tabbed to clean up and repair USC’s basketball program has a history that has followed him to seemingly every coaching stop.
Through his coaching career, the 52-year-old O’Neill has earned a reputation for his fiery and demanding style, which has occasionally alienated those around him. While still paying respect to his ability and coaching methods, some of his former players and assistants have painted the picture of a coach who is the antithesis of the hang-loose style that has made Pete Carroll so popular around campus and throughout the city.
At his introductory press conference as USC’s head basketball coach on June 22, O’Neill told a roomful of reporters, “Contrary to popular belief, I am not Darth Vader.” But Athletic Director Mike Garrett’s decision for the opening left by Tim Floyd’s departure was largely panned by college basketball pundits, with CBS Sports columnist Gregg Doyel writing, “To know Kevin O’Neill is to hate him.”
But O’Neill has an army of colleagues ready to refute the coach’s detractors. Former Knicks coach Jeff Van Gundy, Michigan State coach Tom Izzo and Dallas Mavericks coach Rick Carlisle have all stood by him and sung his praises as a master strategist.
“He’s like a drill sergeant ready to reform everything in the image he desires,” said Evan Eschmeyer, who played two seasons for O’Neill at Northwestern from 1997-99.
“Mad Dog”
Despite spending nine of the last 10 years in the NBA, O’Neill is well known for his college basketball exploits.
His most recent stop, a turmoil-filled 2007 season with Arizona, generated its fair share of headlines as the one-time Wildcat assistant returned to become the interim coach. Legendary coach Lute Olson still hovered around Tucson, however, and the team finished with 19 wins, its lowest output since 1986.
The school still extended its streak of consecutive NCAA Tournament appearances, but many considered the season a disappointment. Olson announced he intended to return the following season (though he retired before the start of the 2008-09 schedule) despite giving O’Neill the title of coach-in-waiting, and O’Neill eventually parted ways with the school the year after being reassigned to a role as a school fundraiser.
“The year took a toll on everybody, but I think he did a really good job in a tough situation,” said Josh Pastner, one of O’Neill’s assistant coaches at Arizona and now the head coach at Memphis. “It helped him get to the point he is now at USC.”
Having coached at Marquette, Tennessee and Northwestern, O’Neill’s resume at the collegiate level extends beyond his one year in the desert — but so too do the stories of his sometimes abrasive style.
O’Neill earned the nickname “Mad Dog” while playing at McGill University, and the moniker extended beyond his playing days.
According to the Memphis Commercial Appeal, when Jason Moore, a reserve guard during O’Neill’s time at Tennessee, struggled in a game against Arkansas, O’Neill yelled at him, “You better hope you die before halftime!”
O’Neill’s vitriol was not reserved only for his players, as on a roadtrip to Pauley Pavilion while coaching with Arizona, he broke a grease board at halftime when his team was down 20 points.
Tavaras Hardy, whom O’Neill recruited to Northwestern and who now serves as an assistant coach at the school, said his former coach had an extensive habit of peppering his addresses to players with expletives.
“He’s going to tell it like he sees it, and sometimes he’s going to say it in an animated way,” he said. “Sometimes it’s actually funny, but it’s no secret that he has a different vocabulary than a lot of people.”
Despite admitting that he has at times had conflicts with players, O’Neill said the only players he didn’t get along with were “the ones who didn’t want to work hard,” and that his coaching style did not create as much friction as advertised.
“If wanting guys to be on time and play their hardest is demanding,” he said, “then I’m demanding.”
But O’Neill’s style has often been grating on players who he inherited from previous rosters, a commonality during many coaching changes. After O’Neill’s second year at Northwestern, four players transferred, albeit for different reasons.
“Initially, there will be some people who will take a second look, especially among the players,” Eschmeyer said. “But as they get used to his style and learn from him, it will all start to make sense.”
A New Leaf
Despite being run ragged, many of O’Neill’s former players see a method to his madness.
Eschmeyer’s introduction to O’Neill came in the form of a four-hour conditioning session that left most of the team keeled over and vomiting in trash cans and the rest weak in the legs.
“The message was that things were different and that we had to come back ready to work, and we definitely got it,” Eschmeyer said. “We came back in shape and were better off for it.”
Eschmeyer developed into an NBA-caliber player, spending four seasons in the league. In Eschmeyer’s first years with the New Jersey Nets, coach Byron Scott employed brutal practice techniques that Pat Riley had used during his time with the Lakers.
“All that stuff was no big deal because I had played for coach O’Neill,” Eshmeyer said. “After playing for him, I had nothing left to be afraid of.”
O’Neill spent last season as an assistant coach and defensive specialist for the NBA’s Memphis Grizzlies. Former head coach Marc Iavaroni found that O’Neill’s personality didn’t live up to what had been said.
“He’s definitely mellowed,” said Iavaroni, who knew O’Neill through previous stops as an assistant in the NBA. “I heard a lot of stories about his intensity, but he was always an even-keeled guy when I was around him.”
Praised for his keen basketball mind, O’Neill has also been lauded for the lasting impact he’s had as a teacher of the game.
“Marc [Iavaroni] and I both look back on our time with him and cherish it because of how much he taught us,” said Jay Triano, who was an assistant to O’Neill in Toronto in 2003-04 and currently serves as the team’s head coach.
A few of the stories involving O’Neill have become the stuff of urban legend, according to Eschmeyer. In a particularly contentious game between Indiana and Northwestern in 1999, Eschmeyer had to separate Indiana coach Bobby Knight and O’Neill when chants started in the Northwestern student section provoked an Indiana assistant.
But Eschmeyer insisted that the two were close friends and that there was never a chance of the incident escalating into anything more than a heated moment.
“What no one knows is that a few minutes after that incident, coach Knight and coach O’Neill are 100 yards behind the bleachers laughing about it,” Eschmeyer said.
O’Neill said he had no regrets about the past and is fully focused on taking USC to the next level.
“Sometimes you wish you had won one more game here and there,” he said. “But I’m comfortable with where I’m at right now.”

Though District 9 is one of the most ambitious films of the summer, it is also one of the most subtle in the way that it uncovers so many possible parallels and connotations to our society, yet appropriately abandons any notion of preaching to its audience.
This process provides the film with an undeniable momentum that is never lost, even when the social criticism is met head-on with extreme violence in the second half of the film. Though director Neill Blomkamp seems to uphold a clear, overall message, he never blinds the audience with it.
Close encounters · Sharlto Copley (top) stars as Wikus Van De Merwe in Neill Blomkap’s sci-fi thriller, District 9. The film explores relations between humans and an extraterrestrial race stranded on Earth. - Photos courtesy of Sony Pictures Entertainment
There are numerous directions to take with District 9, as its plot revolves around the appearance of a monstrous space craft that has lost power over Johannesburg, South Africa, and its millions of alien inhabitants that seek refuge among humans.
At first the aliens — or prawns, which they are because they resemble an elaborate crustacean — are met with fascination and curiosity by the city’s people. But as the prawns become more incorporated and reliant on human society, they become regarded as the lowest class, and are thoroughly discriminated against by the humans.
Segregation becomes mankind’s only response to these extraterrestrials, and the prawns are confined to their own area — labeled District 9 — where they can live peaceful lives, completely void of all human contact. It becomes separate-but-equal all over again.
The prawns become a bastard race, totally disregarded by humanity; the term “prawn” itself is meant to be derogatory. Apartheid is the film’s most prominent allegory, especially since these events take place in South Africa, but District 9 easily unfolds into several other satirical implications — such as the Holocaust, abortion, mass media and corporate greed — as the plot takes shape.
What makes District 9 so successful is how it intertwines all of these elements flawlessly and coherently; as each implication of human selfishness plays out on the screen, it is never overly obnoxious or indulgent in its intent. Finger pointing is inevitable, but like any great satire, it does not become the sole purpose of the film.
Instead of overshadowing the plot by lamenting obvious blame, the film pushes these key issues aside. While their place in the film is important, Blomkamp does not make them the most prominent element, which ultimately maintains the film’s fresh perspective.
Blomkamp also utilizes a superb process of illusions within the film that help balance the action and the narrative. The most crucial example would be the style that drives most of the first half of the film in which a great deal of information is given to the audience as if District 9 were an actual documentary.
This style presents social criticism in a more legitimate manner because, like everything else in the film, it is all presented in a very raw, human approach. It is plagued with personal opinion, bias and a lasting sense of superiority on the part of the humans. Basically, the narrative is presented in an imperfect way — completely unreliable at times, yet still difficult to consider irrelevant.
By strategically establishing this unique narrative, the film creates enough room for its central story of a human stuck in between the human and prawn social struggle, and, as it firmly establishes its protagonist and its direction, District 9 easily reconstructs the very idea of science fiction films altogether.
In many ways, District 9 is purely an action film. The second half is filled with gun battle after gun battle, but similar to 2006’s highly acclaimed Children of Men, the extreme violence is never unnecessary and never questionable.
The film does get very brutal at certain parts, but the violence is given such detail and precision that this first-time director can make the style of veteran action directors like Tony Scott become obsolete. This is only possible because there is as much care given to the violence as there is given to the story — a feat that few films accomplish successfully.
Never taking both its brutality and intellectualism to an extreme, District 9 becomes a standout film that provides a complete visceral experience.

Hi, I’m Jen. I like the Internet, music and all things pop culture. I keep up with my news (think Pitchfork and Twitter, not so much CNN), and I tend to be the one my friends count on to show them YouTube’s next overnight sensation. It might sound pretentious, but I consider myself to be pretty savvy, particularly when it comes to the Wonderful Wide Web.
Having given that brief bio, I am going to admit something to you that I am very ashamed of: I started listening to Animal Collective in spring of 2009 — yes, after Merriwether Post Pavilion. I can now admit that I thought the band was weird before it was “cool.”
Today I think that they’re great (let it be known that I now have a number of their earlier albums), but I am still embarrassed to admit that I was nowhere near cutting-edge enough to jump on such a movement before it was handed to me by hipster bloggers. I was upset over my own slacking, and confused because I was so used to being at the forefront of every hot trend — particularly those concerning music. Why was my tardiness surrounding Panda Bear and Geologist so regrettable?  Because it forced me to question how trendy I really was.
The new equivalent of “hip” is advanced knowledge of the alternative mainstream. Compare those who dig through Tumblr after Tumblr in 2009 to those who dug through countless underground record store crates in 1978. Being the first to know something has always been a sure way to let people know you’re cooler than they are, whether it is clip of a child post-dental anesthesia or the supposed subliminal messages in a backwards playback of “Stairway to Heaven.”
Being the first to rock a hot new link can feel like hanging out at the Factory, and if you’re a self-defined web whore, showing people something from the Internet that only you know is the most efficient source of gratification. It’s the perfect technique when attempting to show others that the way you spend all of your time isn’t completely worthless by proving to them that there’s actually something good out there.
The fact that the majority of the country understands the subtle glory of the online world actually works out favorably. The United States is full of “tweeple” who possess iPhones and personal web domains, and while everybody’s a critic, everybody’s also a listener. The competitiveness among the web-wise brings the most valuable, entertaining or hilarious links to the forefront. By its current nature, the Internet makes everything extremely accessible. Because of these truths, mainstream culture has inevitably become jumbled with alternative culture.
But is this necessarily a bad thing?
Oftentimes, the only difference between a hipster wearing plaid and a teenager wearing pink seems to be the order in which they discover the phenomenon. And yet, this time difference is not enough to truly separate those who’ve been stumbling around the Internet for a while from their naïve, unsuspecting counterparts. If it’s really so great, word will eventually get out.
One of the best things about Internet trends is that most of the time, you aren’t the one who discovers them. These trends tend to find you, either along with a friend’s excited expression or with a hyperlink and a hashmark. Essentially, you could be one of those people who digs through the web’s proverbial dumpster and define yourself by being the first person to discover fmylife.com, but it’s way easier to put the Internet on the backburner and let those who care filter down to the good stuff for you.
Because we are in college, these trends are integrating themselves into our social lives: YouTube videos are the perfect way to break an awkward silence when forging dorm friendships, and when there truly are no words to be said, you can always just quote TextFrom LastNight.
It has taken some time, but I am finally at terms with my personal level of savviness. I am not as hip to the Internet as I once thought, and I am admittedly not the first to know about any of its trends. However, that’s the way I like it. I can survive with my dotcom-hip image intact without spending all day on my MacBook, looking frantically for the band everyone will be into this season.
I remember when all I needed to be cool was a Furby. Today, I want to participate in each and every trend that comes my way. I’m not so much concerned with being the first to find a website, but as long as I eventually discover everything worth knowing, you will have something to read about.

Free college concerts tend to feature a few nameless, forgettable bands kicking off the night, playing indistinguishable music for what seems like centuries. The crowd ferments in increasing BO, boredom and impatience, distracting itself with various substances or electronic devices. Finally, when everyone’s about ready to call it a night, the headlining band — usually some likeable, mainstream group — takes the stage, and the crowd at last receives its due.
But this year’s Welcome Back concert, however, turned out light-years better. USC Program Board scored big with the crowd gathered in McCarthy Quad Saturday night, presenting them with not one, but three worthy indie acts: Down Down Down, As Tall As Lions and headliner Cold War Kids.
Roaring crowd · Long Island-based band As Tall as Lions was an instant crowd pleaser at Saturday’s Welcome Back Concert. - Brandon Hui | Daily Trojan
Concertgoers knew they were in for a rockin’ night when the very first band took the stage. Far from the usual humdrum opening act, Down Down Down began the evening on a high note, performing the kind of upbeat, infectious rock-soul tunes you can’t help but groove to.
With their fun, catchy jams, the relatively unknown band proved worthy of major indie buzz. In their closing song, the band pleaded: Please don’t go / I just wanna kick it with you. Judging by their undeviating attention, the audience seemed to reciprocate the feeling.
Following Down Down Down was major label alternative-rock band As Tall As Lions, who made sure their cross-country trip from New York was worth every CO2 emission. A combination of pitch-perfect harmonies, spunky attitude, unbuttoned shirts and an eclectic lineup of both old and new songs created a show worthy of headliner status.
While frontman Daniel Nigro’s sensual, deliciously tortured vocals were spot-on all night — the aural equivalent of a warm, fuzzy blanket — the East Coast band is about more than just its talented lead vocalist. Bassist Julio Tavarez’s passionate, smooth-as-butter falsetto could’ve brought any audience member to his knees — particularly during his phenomenal vocal solo in “Breakers.” Add in the perfectly timed trumpet solos and ambient instrumental breaks and you’ve got proof that the whole of As Tall As Lions is more than just the sum of its parts.
By the time the band finished off its set a little before nine, many crowd members had most likely forgotten that the “main attraction” of the night was still sitting in its tour bus.
Sure enough, one extremely long, endurance-testing set change later, the black-and-white skeleton cover art of the Cold War Kids’ latest album, Loyalty to Loyalty, unrolled down the backside of the stage with a flourish and the headlining indie-rockers took the stage — much to the loudly proclaimed delight of the front half of the crowd.
The Cold War Kids began with a slow number but immediately dove into one of its iconic tunes, “Something Is Not Right With Me,” showcasing the sharp-as-a-knife vocals of Nathan Willett. The head-banging, fast-paced anthem had the potential to go hugely wrong live in concert, but as ended up being the perfect way to break the ice and loosen up the audience.
A bit of an instrumental break paved the way for two more of the band’s beloved singles: “I’ve Seen Enough,” the video for which has been nominated for Breakthrough Video for the 2009 MTV Music Awards, and “Hang Me Up To Dry,” which had a number of devoted fans singing along at the top of their lungs.
As Willett crooned the arousing refrain of “I’ve Seen Enough” to the excited crowd — How’s it gonna feel when summer ends? / Out of money, out of friends — you just knew that everyone in the crowd was thinking the same thing: “Pretty good now that I’m here, actually, thanks for asking.”
The highlight of the night, though, came several lesser-known songs later when Willett sat before his keyboard and the band slowed it down with a flawless, soulful performance of “We Used To Vacation.”
Subsequent tunes paled in comparison; “Red Wine, Success!” and “Tell Me In The Morning” blended together in a slightly headache-inducing barrage of indistinguishable lyrics.
The band treated the crowd to a new song, “Santa Ana Winds,” a pleasant and rather unobjectionable number, and then closed the night early (“Is that it?” I heard a nearby concertgoer ask) with another fan favorite, “Hospital Beds.” Put out the fire, boys, Willett sang, as if to his band members. Put out the fire on us.
As the stage lights dimmed and the audio switched off, the crowd lingered awkwardly in the quad, hoping for more. Apparently, the audience wasn’t ready to put out the fire — at least not yet.

What’s in the hype? Would a band with any less buzz sound as sweet?
You may have heard of them, but unless you’re a new music prowler, chances are you haven’t. Still, the Phenomenal Handclap Band offers a unique sound worth checking out, no matter what kind of tunes you’re into.
Show of hands · The Phenomenal Handclap Band, which hails from New York City, is composed of eight close-knit musicians. These nightlife veterans are playing the Dim Mak Party at Cinespace tonight, 8 p.m. - Photo courtesy of Big Hassle
“You know when they take a mango and put lime juice on it and dip it in chili powder?” posed the group’s frontman, Daniel Collás. “We would taste like that.”
Why?
“It’s pretty self-explanatory,” Collás said.
For those lacking in their synesthesia skills, the PHB is an eight-person band hailing from lower Manhattan and Brooklyn, and they sound like everything from Pink Floyd to Santana, LCD Soundsystem to Stevie Wonder. Their self-titled LP is interesting and distinctive, filled with groovy tracks and funky rhythms.
Collás is one of the collective’s founders, along with Sean Marquand. Both were once DJs, and the formation of their current project can be accredited to their involvement in New York’s social scene.
“I’ve been involved in nightlife in this city for a long time,” Collás explained. “In addition to DJing, I was promoting parties, and when you’re doing those things you’re out a lot and meet a lot of people.”
Another benefit of being a DJ? Test drives.
“You can play your own stuff out and see peoples’ reactions,” he said. “You have a forum.”
Testing the waters fared well for The Phenomenal Handclap Band. Though many tweaks were made before the record was released to the public, the version you’ll hear today is interesting and enthralling dance rock that could bump at a club or in a pair of headphones just the same.
“We thought about playing it live and making the best record possible,” Collás said of their debut.
Keeping performance in mind proved to be a good decision for the band now well known for its live shows.
The group brings energy when it takes the stage, as any eight-piece band likely would. Its concerts have received a fair amount of press in the Big Apple, which Collás seems to think has something to do with the collective’s underlying sense of community — because the eight of them are so close-knit, it’s like you’re watching a family instead of an array of children from the New York club scene.
“The thing we choose to do more than anything is spend time together,” Collás said. “Even if we’re just hanging out, it’s familiar, as in like a family.”
The result of such band unity is a surprisingly effortless sound that fills a necessary void in today’s music scene, specifically a spot you didn’t know you were missing.
While the band’s sound has been criticized for feeling too “big,” the result of this is a psychedelic feel hard to come by these days. It sounds like a bunch of kids dropped some acid and spiked some dance tunes with rock, funk and whatever else they’d been listening to that month. Opting to leave the assumption up to the listener, Collás will neither confirm nor deny that the band members were under the influence of LSD during the making of their record.
“Anyone who has taken acid and tried to make music, I’m sure while you’re playing it, it sounds cool,” he said. “But regardless, there is usually an engineer or someone in the studio who’s not that high saying, ‘Uh, guys?’ The sound of people on drugs making music is sometimes just not that interesting.”
If anyone knows what makes music interesting, it is Collás and his collective. Their album keeps listeners guessing with everything from obscure influences to surprise guest stars. The addition of blues legend Jon Spencer to “Give It A Rest” makes the track groovy and fun, similar to something Sly & The Family Stone would have dropped when they were feeling annoyed (in a good way, a way that requires cowbell). “Testimony” is catchy in just the right way, featuring hot guitar riffs as well as TV on the Radio’s Jaleel Bunton.
If you listen to the rest of the album in its entirety, you’ll most likely be pleasantly surprised — if not by the sound, then by the fact that music like this is actually being made.
As you lay back and absorb one of our generation’s coolest new experiments, one question will undoubtedly cross your mind: “Why are they called ‘The Phenomenal Handclap Band?’ Where are all the handclaps? It doesn’t make sense.”
Collás has an answer to that.
“The whole reason I got into this business was to put handclaps on records,” he explained. “But people got restless with the idea of using human hands, so we started to use these sort of computerized hands because clapping is the best form of appreciation there is.”
Whether the band’s listeners are at one of the group’s renowned live shows or in their rooms alone, one thing is for sure: innovation that sounds this good deserves a round of applause.

Fighting for our children
On May 15, 2009, I graduated from the University of Southern California and earned a doctorate degree in education. While this graduation was going on, thousands of my education colleagues were protesting against impending state and local budget cuts that, if approved, would terminate their employment at schools located across California. Ironically, the USC graduation keynote speaker was California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger, who is the main advocate of these multi-billion dollar cuts.
As part of the governor’s speech, he stated that we live in America, which he called the greatest country in the world. He added that, based on personal experience, this is a place of great opportunity for all who wish to realize great American dreams. He then presented graduates with the following Six Rules of Success:  1) trust yourself; 2) break the rules; 3) don’t be afraid to fail; 4) don’t listen to naysayers; 5) work hard; and 6) give back.  With due respect to the governor’s speech, instead of trying to harm America’s children by victimizing the education profession, he needs to walk his talk and help educators to succeed. Specifically, he needs to listen to educators and our interpretation of his rules.
On trust, the governor must understand that it does not come automatically; rather, it must be earned by thinking, speaking and behaving with integrity. This includes keeping all of our promises. During his political campaigns, he promised to be a strong ally of educators and committed to help us make our schools safe and successful learning environments, where principals lead, teachers teach and students achieve at the highest educational levels. If he wants our trust, then he must learn to keep all of his promises.
Breaking the rules requires us to separate those that oppress and dehumanize us from those that strengthen our existence. If California’s executive and legislative budget rules are used to oppress and victimize the lives of educators and students, then they must be opposed and changed. California’s rules of origin must ensure the continuous employment, promotion and success of educators and the education profession.
As educators, we have also learned that fear of failure must be conquered with the love, courage and wisdom of our human spirits. In addressing the social, economic and educational challenges confronting all our students, failure is not an option. Hence, the governor needs to understand that, despite all threats to our existence — if criminals, terrorists, or politicians try to harm our students — we will not allow them to succeed. Purposefully, we are ready, willing and able to struggle and risk our lives to protect the lives of our students.
Beyond the negativity of naysayers, educators believe that all humans are born with the evolving capability to learn and achieve success at home, at school and in the world. In particular, we believe in using our talents to help transform negatives into positives. For example, we can take weak students and teach them how to cultivate their inner and outer strengths. Therefore, despite the most difficult circumstances confronting us, we have the highest expectations of all our students. We believe that all students can and will learn to achieve success at the highest educational levels.
To help realize the great American dreams of our students, as educational leaders, we are committed to work hard and be smart. This work includes sacrificing our personal comforts to heal the wounds of students, wipe their tears, feed their hungry stomachs, calm their fears, ensure their health and safety, help them do their school work and motivate them to succeed. Accordingly, we do not want preferential treatment based on political convenience; rather, we demand the highest respect for our hard work.
A great leader once said that, “Education is learning to do the work of God.” We agree with this definition. Our purpose is to be civil servants and give back to our local school communities. Specifically, we are committed to sharing our blessings with all our needy students. Our lives are thus dedicated to ensure the survival and success of America’s future, which is represented by our students.
The above interpretations of the governor’s Rules of Success represent a higher calling that the he and the California legislature need to respect in restoring full faith and funding to the education profession. In this light, we urge the governor and the legislature to please stop the cuts to education and assist us in serving, protecting and empowering the lives of our children. In the words of the governor: “We owe humanity at least as much as it has given us.” Put in other words, we owe our children, and the educators that influence our schooling, our greatest appreciation, respect and support.

Israel’s contributions substantial
Recently, arguments for an American boycott of Israel have been suggested; however, boycotting Israel is ill-advised. We, the undersigned organizations, strongly express our opposition to an economic, academic or cultural boycott of the State of Israel. As both Americans and USC students, we should respect Israel’s vibrant and pluralistic democracy.
To begin with, Israel is a democracy in the Middle East that ensures equal rights to all of its citizens, including women. Arab citizens of Israel, including Arab woman, enjoy these rights, one of which is the right to vote. Arab citizens have the added perk of being able to opt out of Israel’s draft. Israel’s achievements have made a significant global impact.
Israel has been instrumental in developing modern medical advancements. The PillCam, developed in Israel by Given Imaging Ltd., is an ingestible disposable miniature camera used by doctors to noninvasively visualize the small intestine and esophagus.
Israel is a leader in green energy production. In Southern California, the Mojave Desert’s Solar Electric Generating System was engineered by Israelis in the 1980s. Currently, Solel Solar Systems Ltd., helps operate this field of solar panels, which comprise the world’s largest and most productive solar power plant. SEGS generates enough energy to supply 230,000 homes with power, offsetting 3,800 tons of pollution annually and reducing US dependence on oil by more than 1 million barrels per year.
Israel is an important part of our national security. Security officials from Ben Gurion International Airport, perhaps the safest airport in the world, advise local authorities on how to improve security at the Los Angeles International Airport, and US law enforcement agencies are trained by Israeli officials in tactics against terrorism.
Israel has made many technological advances, which many students take for granted. The first popular instant messaging program, ICQ, was developed by the Israeli company Mirabilis. The ICQ technology was used to vastly improve AOL Instant Messaging technology. The Israeli company Comverse, then called Efrat, invented voicemail. Israel pioneered the first Voice Over Internet Protocol technology for an internet phone network. This same technology is used by Skype. Many of Cisco’s recent computer technologies were developed in Israel, including the Pentium-4 Microprocessor, the Centrino Processor, the Pentium MMX and the Pentium M series. M-system, an Israeli company, developed the first USB flash drive.
In short, the majority of computers and cell phones used by USC students contain technology developed in Israel. Each time we use Skype or save information on a USB flash drive, we are using technology produced in Israel. Every time we depart from or arrive in LAX, we have a reassured sense of security, because of Israel’s advances in security techniques. The fact is, without students even being aware of it, Israel has vastly improved the lives of everyone on our campus.
Whether medical, environmental or technological, Israel continually demonstrates its commitment to improving the global human condition, and we, as university students, can aspire to do the same.

Colleges across the country have been taking a step forward in their recruitment processes — by not walking backwards. The New York Times reported last week that a growing number of American universities have been urging their beleaguered tour guides to walk forward, instead of the usual backward saunter practiced by the more seasoned vets.
This trend comes as a welcome respite for all those tired of watching out for the poor shmuck whose job it is to blindly navigate the precarious landscape of fallen bicycles, wayward pedestrians and grassy hills (or, in USC’s case, hill — singular). It also looks to curtail the tired walking-backward patter delivered by each tour guide, as if he or she was the first one to joke, “Let me know if I’m about to run into anything.”
On a larger scale, however, colleges like the University of Texas at Austin, American University in Washington, DC and Hendrix College in Arkansas are in the process of completely overhauling the campus tour, focusing less on hitting rising high school seniors and their parents with a barrage of statistics and more on creating a fluid question-and-answer interaction.
USC would do well to follow this paradigm. Known as a university with an increasingly aggressive recruitment program to match its rising rankings, campus tours here seem to fall under a strictly regimented pattern. Guides unfailingly mention that the VKC globe makes it the tallest building on campus, that CTCS 466  (the film symposium where students watch not-yet-released movies) is the most popular class in the university and that Tommy Trojan boasts the distinct ability of defying the bounds of physiology by flexing every single muscle in his body simultaneously.
USC’s ranking, its proportion of international students and its Lexus Gauntlet record are recited with the sing-song quality of a nursery rhyme, giving the tour a holier-than-thou clinical feeling to the preceding. But perhaps, instead of talking to the potential students, guides should initiate a conversation with them.
Because, in the end, spitballing statistics is just ass-backwards.

We, the public, demand a lot from our Hollywood stars. We’ve certainly had our way with the buxom blonde songstresses and ditzy heiresses, and we’ve preyed unremittingly on the clean-cut, sexually-curious boy banders, A-list couples in hiding and, of course, the young, physically abusive R&B entertainers. But somewhere on this path of unreasonable privacy invasion, we learned that real people could be just as interesting.
Before the tabloid whirlwind is finally laid to rest (if that ever happens), the American public will have mercilessly plumaged right through a once-normal American household from Pennsylvania, headed by a once-happily married couple.
Matteo Marjoram | Daily Trojan
And we’re not the least bit sorry.
This transition from the public’s fixation from talented megastars to average nobodies was gradual. While the overnight popularity of television’s move to more reality programming may just be a catalyst, TLC’s Jon & Kate Plus 8 has taken our addiction to new heights, giving viewers a warped peek into married and family life that has ended disastrously.
Granted, the lives of Jon and Kate Gosselin and their exceptional brood were never really normal to begin with. The fact that Kate birthed twins back in 2000 and then, after wanting just one more, was surprised by sextuplets makes her quite the child-bearer — a record that only another tabloid hot mess, “Octomom,” can compete with.
Even in the show’s opening segment where Kate was humored by the concept of her and Jon’s “crazy” life, she could have never anticipated the “crazy” that was about to come: Jon and the nanny, an alleged affair between Kate and her bodyguard, family member sellouts on morning talk shows, ratings games with a greedy, money-seeking network and, eventually, a bitter custody battle and heated divorce splashed on the front covers of all six major tabloids.
But selfishly we read the stories in the grocery line and shelled out $4 to buy the magazines, never stopping to pose a greater question. On the premiere of the show’s fifth season, the one when the torn couple famously announced their split, 10.6 million of us curiously tuned in, allowing TLC to shatter yet another record — all, of course, at the expense of Jon and Kate’s Multiple Blessings (the couple’s New York Times best-selling parenting book).
So with girlfriend-juggling Jon partying in the Hamptons with another father of the year, Michael Lohan, and newly-single Kate off to a hair appointment somewhere in Beverly Hills, we should be wondering: Who’s watching the kids? Are they getting fed enough? Who’s taking them to school?
The thing is, nobody cares.
As people follow their show, the trade-off for the Gosselins is a depleting sense of empathy for their highly sensationalized situation. While some encroach on the show as pure means of entertainment and think that it could never happen to them, others take it as an ordinary and realistic depiction of an institution that has become just as a crucial to American culture as marriage: divorce.
Today, the “50 percent of all marriages in America end in divorce” tagline has become so known that it will probably never find its way underneath a Snapple cap. The TLC show’s success can be attributed to normal people projecting their personal relationship woes on a platform that was at one point most unsuspecting.
Perhaps our love for the Gosselin family is actually understandable, especially in a day when society’s marriage values are becoming more liberal, moving further away from the tired, no-longer-true concept of “white picket fence, mom, dad, two kids and a dog.”
But for some, watching the happy, all-American family thrive for four seasons only to fall apart before our very eyes still seems like a gross activity, especially considering the eight young children involved.
Well maybe, maybe not.
Divorce is by no means a light subject, but it has become a common, though less-than-ideal, lifestyle that children all across the country have had to cope with. The Gosselin clan, though ridiculously cute and adorable, is no different.
As for the parents, studies show that while people are at risk of divorce throughout their marriages, that risk intensifies in years five through 10. Even under the spotlight projected on national TV, Jon and Kate’s 10-year union qualifies. The couple’s public fallout may also be looked at as a warning or confirmation for those who are on the fence when it comes to getting married. Cohabitation, or couples moving in and having children without marriage, makes up nearly a 10th of all US households.
With changing value systems, social movements and finally reality shows, it is the American public that is responsible for perpetuating this new ideal. It proves that marriage and the institution of family is just not what it used to be. This is not a critique of the state of marriage, but as a realization of an obvious trend that is growing more apparent in American society.
With all of Hollywood’s smoke and mirrors, maybe there is actually a glimmer of reality in reality TV.

With the economic recession adding to the strain on students’ wallets, many are now choosing to stop buying expensive textbooks and rent them instead.
The book rental model, which allows students to rent textbooks and then return them after finals with free return shipping, has been around since 2007, but has shown significant sales increases since the economy tanked last year.
Chegg.com, an online book rental company, was an early entrant on the rental scene. The company started renting textbooks two years ago. Since then, other companies like BookRenter.com and CampusBookRentals.com into the market.
“Buying new or used textbooks may not be a complete and viable solution for a student, so we sought to save students money by giving them another option,” said USC alumnus Jim Safka, the chief executive officer of Chegg.
Company representatives said the market has grown primarily through word of mouth on campuses around the country.
Chegg, for example, has student users at more than 6,000 universities nationwide. Newer companies like BookRenter.com have customers at more than 3,000 campuses nationwide, representatives said.
Amy Herrmann, a sophomore majoring in international relations, said she decided to rent her textbooks after learning about Chegg from a family friend who was able to rent a law textbook valued at $280 for $30 per semester. Herrmann rented nine textbooks from Chegg, paying $150 for the semester.
“It looked like a cost-effective option, as I’m not going to keep all of my textbooks,” Herrmann said.  “I got all my books in wonderful condition, and so far it’s a really great service.”
Laura Sneddon, marketing manager for BookRenter.com, said the company saw a 750 percent increase in revenue in the first half of 2009, compared to the same period the year before.
“More people want to save money by renting and the whole renting phenomenon is going to grow as students continue to have financial troubles in this economy,” Sneddon said.
However, not all students think the idea of renting textbooks is the most thrifty or practical option.
“I think after the time I sell the book that the cost difference between buying and renting isn’t enough for me to seriously consider renting,” said Andrew Gier, a sophomore majoring in writing for screen and television.
Gier said students should research the price of textbooks and options of selling books back before turning to rental sites.
Although students may be able to make money by buying textbooks and reselling them online, on websites such as Half.com or MyBookBuyer.com, renting offers students the ability to save money upfront. This allows them to have more money available to meet other immediate needs.
Chegg also offers students the option of changing their “rental” to a purchase option by paying the remaining value of the book.
Many students said the choice between renting and buying seems logical.
“It’s nice to know that right up- front I’m saving money that I can then use for other things,” said Leslie Marchand, a sophomore majoring in cinema-television production who rented her textbooks from Chegg.
Pertusati USC Bookstore administrators said they do not think book rental companies pose a threat to bookstore profits.
“Right now it’s too early to really tell, but I wonder if [Chegg] would even have the inventory to fulfill students’ textbook needs,” said Raymond McDermott, senior manager of course materials for the bookstore.
McDermott said he could not see the bookstore renting out textbooks in the future, largely due to economic reasons.
“We have to purchase all our textbooks upfront, so doing a rental program would not even allow us to break even,” McDermott said. “Also, renting textbooks out is usually is something done at community colleges where professors have less autonomy.”

The same day his son turned four months old, Travion Ford appeared in court facing a murder charge in the case of a USC student who was stabbed to death last fall.
The trial for the 25-year-old began Aug. 17 in front of an emotional group of family and friends. Three days later, the prosecution and defense gave their opening statements, presenting critically different versions of what happened the night 23-year-old USC School of Cinematic Arts student Bryan Frost died.
While Ford has admitted to stabbing Frost, he has pleaded not guilty to one count of murder. Ford’s public defender, Diane Butko, insisted in court that her client didn’t intend to kill Frost in the Sept. 18, 2008 incident and the act was made in self-defense.
The sequence of events detailed in Deputy District Attorney Kennes Ma’s opening statement, however, aimed to show that Ford acted not in self-defense, but out of violence.
According to Ma, Frost and two others were near the corner of 28th Street and Orchard Avenue after leaving the 901 Bar and Grill when he slammed a metal gate shut, prompting Ford — who was at his mother’s house with his fiancé, Anquenette Young — to confront the three men.
Ford and Frost exchanged words, then began to fight one another, throwing punches and wrestling on the ground. At one point, Ma told the jury, Frost pinned Ford to the ground and then got up to walk away. After being released, Ford ran inside his mother’s apartment and  returned with a knife. After confronting Frost again, Ford stabbed him.
Butko’s opening remarks told a similar tale, but with key differences.
“The only reason Mr. Ford used deadly force was because he felt his life was in danger and he would die,” Butko said in her opening statement.
Butko said Ford tried to “poke” Frost with a knife he already had while he was pinned down because he was having difficulty breathing.
“Mr. Ford had a knife in the front pocket of his sweatshirt and he finally gets it and tries to poke him,” Butko said. “He’s not sure he even made contact.”
There was no second fight, Butko continued — after Frost let go of Ford, Ford ran inside the apartment complex to find help and after he was unable to do so, returned to protect Young, who Butko said was being verbally harassed by the three students. Ford and Young left the scene because he didn’t want the fight to continue, Butko said.
USC student Nicholas Wisniewski, who was with Frost and was the first witness to testify.
When Ford originally confronted Frost about the gate, Wisniewski said Ford was very aggressive and started the physical fight.
“The defendant took a swing at Bryan and Bryan responded,” Wisniewski said in his testimony.
Things then escalated, Wisniewski said. Young began to yell at Wisniewski and USC student Chris Funkhouser, who was also with Frost, while Ford and Frost both fell to the ground. After Frost let Ford up, the three walked away to avoid another fight, Wisniewski said. They then heard a shout and saw Ford coming toward them.
“He came up and sort of shoved Bryan. They swung for a few seconds and then he turned and ran away,” Wisniewski said. “It was very fast.”
After Ford and Young left, the three continued to walk away before Frost suddenly stopped.
“He turns to me and he says, ‘Yo dude, I think I just got stabbed,’” Wisniewski said. “And he lifts up his shirt and I see blood pouring out of his left side.”
Wisniewski also recounted trying to keep Frost alert while he called the USC Department of Public Safety.
“I propped his head up on my knees and was talking to him, trying to keep him awake,” he said.
Frost’s mother — who traveled from Idaho to Los Angeles for the trial with other members of Frost’s family — sobbed as Wisniewski’s call to DPS was played in the courtroom.
Ford — who also had family members in the courtroom — sat stoically throughout the proceedings, often looking back toward his family and blowing kisses in their direction.
While Ma stressed Ford’s aggression in his remarks, Butko said Ford was remorseful for what happened.
“When he found out this individual had died, he fell to his knees,” she said. “He was crying, he was praying — he didn’t know what to do.”
Ultimately, the jury must determine if Ford acted in self defense or if the act should be considered murder.
The trial continues this week, and Ma said he expects closing arguments to occur Wednesday or Thursday.
If convicted of first-degree murder, Ford faces 26 years to life in prison.

Five years ago, nine freshmen walked onto the USC campus as members of the women’s soccer team.
Over the next four years, they took a mediocre program and established it as one of the best collegiate women’s soccer programs in the nation. The highlight, of course, was the national championship that those nine women brought to USC in 2007 for the first time.
But now, six of those talented players have graduated, including three All-Americans in Janessa Currier, Amy Rodriguez and Ashley Nick. Only three fifth-year seniors, Meagan Holmes, Marihelen Tomer and Brittany Massro, remain from the best recruiting class in USC history. But make no mistake, even with the departure of those key players, the Women of Troy will be focused on reaching the NCAA Tournament for the fifth-time in a row while contending for a national championship in 2009.
“All of [last year’s seniors] had really big impacts on the team and you can’t replace that,” Holmes said. “But the incoming class has great potential and they bring a lot of experience. They will be a great addition.”
The Women of Troy do return seven starters, including senior goalkeeper Kristen Olsen. Olsen has proved to be one of the best goalkeepers in the nation, as she was recently named to the Watch List for the MAC Hermann Trophy, which is given out at the end of the year to the top women’s collegiate player. Olsen has a program-best 0.55 goals against average, and with 20 career shutouts, she just needs six more to become USC’s all-time leader in that category.
“It’s an honor to be nominated and looked at, but I just will take it game-by-game. There’s not any added pressure,” Olsen said.
Having played with Olsen for four years, Holmes knows that she’s more than deserving of the award.
“She plays a huge role for our team,” Holmes said of Olsen. “She’s one of the top ranked goalkeepers, if not the best, in the nation. She comes up with big saves every game and she has to perform this year.”
Olsen will need to rely on all of her experience as she anchors a backline that lost two four-year starters in Currier and Stacey Strong. Sophomores Claire Schloemer and Chelsea Buehning will replace the departed seniors, and the veteran All-American Holmes will provide key leadership to the relatively young defense.
“It’s hard because over the past four years, you develop a good relationship with the backline girls. But the girls coming in have picked it up very quickly and it’s easy to them to step in once they have learned the system,” Holmes said.
On the offensive side, the Women of Troy lost the leading goal-scorer in Rodriguez, but they return points leader junior midfielder Ashli Sandoval and second-leading goal scorer, junior midfielder Alyssa Dávila. Sophomore Ashley Freyer will be counted on more as she scored four goals off the bench last year, and junior Megan Ohai, who played with the U.S. Under-23 U.S. National Team in Europe this summer, will more than make up for Rodriguez’s absence.
“The way we play, the ball gets spread around really well. Last year, we had a lot of people that had multiple goal games. So there will be a leading scorer, but everyone will contribute,” coach Ali Khosroshahin said.
Those players expected to contribute include three freshmen, defender Kelly Morgan, midfielder Courtney Garcia, and forward Samantha Johnson. Morgan and Johnson saw minutes in USC’s first game, a 3-0 loss at Texas A&M, and Khosroshahin knows that he just has to give the freshmen and new starters a little bit of time to adjust to their new roles.
“We need to give the new kids time to get experience. We have to be patient and understand there will be some growing paints. But once they get their opportunities, in the long run it will be fantastic,” Khosroshahin said.
With seven starters returning, and three freshmen and multiple sophomores expecting to contribute much more than they have last season, the Women of Troy have something that can counter the loss of the talented seniors: depth.
“The first time we scrimmage, the starting team and the players on the bench were even,” Olsen said. “It’s a good thing to have, because if someone gets injured, we haven’t suffered from the loss.”
A couple of years ago, the Women of Troy flew under the radar and won the national title. But with that title comes a target, and even though they are one-year removed from that championship, they know they still are circled on many opposing teams’ calendars.
“Now we have expectations and standards we have to perform to,” Holmes said.
The Women of Troy hope they fulfill those expectations, and bring in another national title.
