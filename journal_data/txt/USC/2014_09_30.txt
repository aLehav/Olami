Combining upbeat tempos and melodies with optimistic lyrics, American Authors is a gleeful band, as they should be after catapulting into pop success in the past year.
Layers · Riding their two hit singles “Believer” and “Best Day of My Life,” the band has started to make waves in the music business. Their music sounds like generic indie rock at first listen but upon further inspection their multiple layers of production value and polish emerge from the mix. – Photo courtesy of Fresh Clean Media
Following in the footsteps of rock-pop and alt-pop heavyweights such as Paramore and Panic! at the Disco, American Authors will be headlining this year’s Honda Civic Tour, their biggest headlining tour to date.
The band will be in the Southern California area next week, with shows at The Observatory in Santa Ana on Oct. 3, as well as at Club Nokia in Downtown Los Angeles on Oct. 4.
Formed in 2007 at the Berklee College of Music, the band consists of singer Zac Barnett, guitarist James Adam Shelley, bassist Dave Rubin and drummer Matt Sanchez. As Barnett tells it, the group came together organically. They have since seemed to similarly float along the path to widespread success.
Their two hit singles, “Believer” and “Best Day of My Life,” have been making waves through the pop world, with “Best Day of My Life” peaking at No. 11 on the Billboard Hot 100 and No. 1 on Billboard’s Adult Pop list.
Barnett describes their sound as diverse, a result of the band members coming from different corners of the nation. They draw inspiration from Latin, blues and classic rock genres, and each member brings a different perspective to the band’s overarall musical direction.
“An author is not someone just who tells a story through written words. We tell our story through lyrics and music,” Barnett said.
Concertgoers can expect an upbeat, enthusiastic rock performance with less polish than their high-production songs. Fans will find it easy, however, to tap into the energy of the event.
“Our show has a lot of dynamics, it goes up and down and it’s a rollercoaster,” Barnett said. “But we really try to make sure that energy is there.”
On first listen, the band easily slips into the niche of happy indie-rock that is taking over commercials, movies, radio and television. Their sound is similar to that of of The Lumineers and Magic!, but with a little more synth and a little more lightheartedness. For such a young band, the levels of production value and polish are impressive, showcasing their knack for putting out hits.
“We’re always very aware of the other bands in our scene, and we’re big fans, too,” Barnett said.
Their enthusiasm for the process and business mindset led to them dropping out of school in Boston and moving, unsigned, to New York City in hopes of expanding their reach.
“It was definitely a little scary at first, it was a big deal to drop out of school something you’ve become comfortable with,” Barnett said. ”You’re just kind of moving with a dream really.”
That dream appears to have come true for the foursome, who now have a record deal, hit singles and a headlining tour in the works.
American Authors is a testament to a new kind of success in the changing musical landscape. Much of the band’s popular exposure is tied to the usage of ”Best Day of My Life” in commercials for Lowe’s, Hyundai and Telecom New Zealand, as well as the trailer for the Vince Vaughn film Delivery Man and ESPN’s 2013 coverage of the World Series of Poker.
Radio airplay has also featured the band quite often, with Barnett attributing the popularity of “Believer” to word of mouth referrals that placed them on the radar for alt-rock radio.
“Those two songs organically taking off really spurred us on,” he said. “Not only did they get these opportunities, the success kind of stuck.”
The songs were licensed in a number of other ways as well, cementing their status in the public eye and giving the band legitimacy in a competitive music world.
The band walks the line between classical and contemporary success, having been signed to Island Records in 2013, but also promoting their music via streaming services and commercial licensing.
Barnett describes the process of getting signed as a landmark achievement.
“It’s something that we’ve dreamt of and thought about since we were young kids,” he said. “It’s not the end-all, be-all, but it’s definitely such a milestone reach.”
He acknowledged that today, streaming services put musicians under a keen microscope, and said that the band uses that as motivation. American Authors cites bands such as Mumford & Sons and Imagine Dragons as inspiration for a successful musical model in their genre.
“If you want to be an artist that stays around for a while like them, you need to be making a truly great product,” he said. “Every song needs to be good.”

Take a break from the frat parties and take that person you have been crushing on out on a date. What makes a perfect first date is subjective. When sparks are flying, you could be walking across campus with a new friend and suddenly realize that you just had the greatest time of your life. But, if you are desperately trying to win someone over, though, you are probably carefully planning every minute of your time together, hoping that his or her friends gave you the correct advice on what that special someone would enjoy. What I discovered in my quest to uncover the secret to the perfect first date or the perfect anytime date were the many variables necessary to call it just that: perfect. The biggest surprise was that many students don’t go on dates until they’ve gotten to know each other—the exact opposite of our parents’ generation. In my opinion, to truly get to know someone, you must enjoy his or her company one-on-one, away from the hustle and bustle of college life.
Presentation counts · First dates can be tricky business, but with the right preparation, they can be an exciting time. Making sure to be well-dressed and well-groomed is an important step, but, laughter is the most important factor for having a fun and entertaining time out. – Photo illustration by Mariya Dondonyan
 
When I asked people who have had the pleasure of many first dates about how to create the perfect date, their stories and advice gushed forth. Individuals shared with me stories of lovely delights and disastrous nights. With that said, every retelling of the perfect first date had two not-so-surprising key ingredients: romance and laughter. In addition to those key characteristics to a successful first date were two facts about the person they’re wooing: Are they indoorsy or outdoorsy, and high or low maintenance.
Everyone wants their date’s heart to stop when they get picked up for that perfect first date. It doesn’t matter who did the asking, you want that other person to think they have just died and gone to heaven simply by being in your company. So grooming is essential, from your head to your toes. My research showed that so many people wanted to slam the door when they got a glimpse of all those flakes on their date’s shoulder, bad breath and that “sorry, I just got of bed” look. Get it together. Do the extra work. Make sure you’re ready for your close up.
Hands down, the most complaints I received about their first dates were regarding their date’s lips. What a way to ruin a great night by having steel wool kiss your cheek. Slather on the petroleum jelly all day before your date. Perfect first date lips should be passionate and sexy. Those lips should be smooth as silk and leave your date wanting more.
So what did you say you were thinking of wearing? It doesn’t matter what the game plan is for your date; both parties’ outfits better scream confidence. Even if you’re going apple picking, the farmer’s son had the right idea with faded blue jeans and tight white shirts if you aren’t into flashy confidence.
Now that you’ve been groomed, what is the consensus for a perfect date?
“Make me laugh.” Yes, that seems to be the ticket. Before you go out though, set the mood by bringing your date a small tokens of affection. I find that a single flower or a tiny box of chocolates really sets the tone for a romantic evening. Thoughtfulness is what seemed to be common on the best first dates.
Comedy clubs earn the top date spot, and Los Angeles has an awesome array of clubs. From new comics to big names, laughter is the best icebreaker and there are clubs in every price range. My favorite place is The Comedy and Magic Club in Hermosa Beach. It is reasonably priced, the food is decent and every show I’ve seen has been hilarious.
It doesn’t have to be so cut and dry. Like every great story, a good beginning, middle and end needs to be incorporated.
If you’re feeling up to an all-day affair, you can start your date earlier in the day on the Strand in Hermosa Beach before the show. Rent bikes and ride all the way to Santa Monica Pier and back. Bring a backpack with a couple of waters for your scenic excursion (30 miles), stop along the way to check out the surfers and grab some ice cream in Venice Beach on your way back. At this juncture, you know how the rest of the evening will progress. Meander through shops and restaurants, and finally make your way to the club. Laugh hysterically, even at the bad comics, and with plenty of endorphins released, head back to campus, relaxed and happy after a stress-free date.

Los Angeles is a top tourist destination, attracting visitors from near and far with its sunshine and palm trees. Those who actually live in Los Angeles, however, can attest to the fact that the City of Angels can at times be underwhelming. There’s only so many times you can visit LACMA or stroll along the Walk of Fame before landmarks begin to lose their appeal. USC alumnus Ali Khoshgozaran, aware of the problem Angelenos face, founded Watsup, an app that allows users to check out what is happening around their location.
The new app, launched a month ago, compiles all the interesting events going on around a user. With just one click, you can discover new restaurants, gallery openings or museum exhibitions right on your news feed. The app’s vibrant design and aesthetic lets users seamlessly scroll through Instagrams or tweets of a Dodgers game or local music festival. Users can also explore other cities, including New York, San Francisco and Las Vegas through their newsfeed.
The app’s mascot, a technicolor octopus, epitomizes the multitude of possibilities in the vicinity and beyond. This octopus’ many arms represent how one can be anywhere at once, and it signifies the large variety of cool events that can pop up on your newsfeed.
“With a single slide, you can ‘watch’  the grand opening of a hotel in Las Vegas 300 miles away and with another swipe you can follow a fashion show 3000 miles away in New York as it unfolds in real-time,” Khoshgozaran said. “So, this whole motion of the app allows you to go anywhere you want, very quickly. So the octopus is our way of indicating this power for you.”
Khoshgozaran graduated from the Viterbi School of Engineering with a Ph.D. in computer science in 2010. Upon starting his own consulting firm after graduation, he discovered that tech companies were amassing large amounts of data. Watsup utilizes that data so that users are able to access it at any time.
“When I graduated from USC, I started a consulting company with my partner, Alireza, and then we did some software development for a client,” Khoshgozaran said. “And because we both had technical backgrounds, we started thinking about how we could build a company around real-time data, because there is so much of it.”
Khoshgozaran reflected on how helpful attending USC for his Ph.D. degree was. He noted that USC’s famous Trojan Family offered invaluable assets to the success of Watsup. Also, Viterbi’s newest incubator “Viterbi Startup Garage” helped catalyze the launch of his app.
“USC was instrumental for this whole thing and in so many angles,” Khoshgozaran said. “[Number one,] my Ph.D. supervisor was our first company advisor. Number two, we actually decided to join an incubator at USC. USC gave us a very strong network of resources, academic resources to hire from, mentors to talk to, advisors to speak with.”
To obtain data, Khoshgozaran and his team employ many complicated algorithms as the most efficient way to gather data from within a user’s vicinity. The algorithm combs through the Internet and social media sites to deliver real-time results. This app is the perfect way for users to access and utilize big data to their own benefit. And users are responding positively to this innovative way of consuming information.
“It has been a month since we have been up in the app store. And there is a lot of engagement and excitement from our users. To give you an idea, over the past few weeks, people have been swiping around 100,000 times,” Khoshgozaran said. “So the reception has been overwhelming, one third of people spend over 1-3 minutes on the app. They launch it multiple times a week. We are getting a ton of feedback from our users, and we are working on a massive update.”
Although Watsup is currently only open in five cities, Khoshgozaran hinted that the company will be going global, and that it will be open to users on Android devices. Going international implies that users will be using this app as a travel aid. Khoshgozaran has said that users have reported back in a positive manner for travel.
“Our future plan is to expand our coverage to more cities and devices. Android and other major U.S. cities are coming soon. We also have a lot of people who travel, and users have said that it is such an organic way to see cities in a new way,” Khoshgozaran said.
Khoshgozaran also left a little teaser for users.
“I can’t really talk about it yet, but a little hint: We are talking with a couple of celebrities for the future.”

USC alumnus and film director Jason Reitman confronts the disadvantages of a technology-obsessed world for relationships in his new movie, Men, Women & Children, starring big Hollywood names Adam Sandler, Jennifer Garner and Ansel Elgort.
Best known for his successful 2007 film Juno, Reitman tackles several issues common among teens and parents in today’s tech-savvy world, including anorexia, the effects of divorce on couples and children, and sexless marriage in his newest project. The film, a cinematic adaption of Chad Kultgen’s 2011 novel, skillfully interconnects the lives of the characters with a keen appreciation of the generational differences between the teenagers and their parents.
The film begins with a view of the Voyager 1 spacecraft and the condescending yet comical commentary given by Emma Thompson about the insignificance of human beings in the universe. A film dedicated to Reitman’s theory of contemporary American behavior — that is, the overwhelming obsession with the Internet and smartphones — Men, Women & Children also places a strong emphasis on porn and what can happen when the World Wide Web makes it easily accessible for both teenagers and adults. Bored and bearded Don Truby (Adam Sandler) is secretly addicted to porn, while his wife Helen (Rosemarie DeWitt) loses interest in her husband but cautiously seeks to fulfill her sexual desires through a site for finding partners for affairs. We also see their 15-year-old son Chris (Travis Tope) struggling with the consequences of porn addiction, as he is incapable of experiencing sexual arousal through real life.
The main theme, of course, is how conflict is created by the influence of technology. Yes, there is the cliché mass crowd scene where everyone in the high school hallways is on his or her phone (sounds like an anti-cyberbullying video, no?). And yes, viewers get to see the consequences of video game addiction through Ansel Elgort’s somewhat refreshing character Tim, who deals with his mother’s abandonment by “escaping from reality” into the cyber world of Guild Wars. It doesn’t stop there, though. There is also a young girl struggling with anorexia and a mother (Jennifer Garner) who is obsessed with protecting her daughter from the dangers of the Internet. Though some of these stories have a predictable ending, others actually have some surprises. But overall, the audience gets a story, perhaps due to the seriousness and significance of the moral, that has been told several times already.
There is one profound and necessary motif that is included in the film that saves it from being completely mired in cliché, however. Reitman makes an interesting point about the way parents approach sex compared to their teenage kids. The adults, afraid of confronting the issue at hand, avoid the subject altogether. On the other hand, the audience sees a boy willing to initiate sexual relations with a teen girl suffering from anorexia, but later treats this matter very indifferently. This encounter with the boy has severe health and emotional consequences for insecure Allison (Elena Kampouris), again reinforcing the notion that the abuse of technological connectivity is unhealthy.
Reitman maintains a cool tone throughout the picture as he unifies the numerous storylines to intersect at a moment where the characters create direct connections, mostly romantically, which we can see in the sweet relationship of Brandy (Kaitlyn Dever) and Tim.
Despite the cliché aspects of the film, it remains meaningful and creates opportunities for person-to-person conversation about its theme and conflicts. The purpose of the film seems to be to demonstrate both the bad choices that the teens and adults make, as well as show the audience that their intentions were rooted in their need for authentic human connection.
Men, Women & Children certainly succeeded in its goal to inform viewers of the importance of unplugging from technology from time to time to focus on what’s truly important in life: relationships with family and friends. The picture just barely avoids being another after school special by empathizing with its many diverse characters and taking a less judgmental approach to the subject matter. The cast of this film was definitely brilliantly chosen, as they clearly put on fantastic performances. Though the film cannot possibly cover and indeed does not cover all grounds of the negative consequences of a technology-dependent world (there is no obvious plot for the psychological results of cyber-bullying) it tackles some issues that are worthwhile to think about as the world becomes more and more reliant on technology. With its precise depiction of problems that people the present day face, Men, Women & Children can be seen as a picture that is a snapshot of this very moment but most likely will look quite strange and inaccurate within a few years from now.

The Dept. of Public Safety released the Annual Security and Fire Report on Tuesday, which contained crime statistics for the past three years and outlined crime and safety policies for all USC campuses.
Colleges and universities that participate in federal aid programs are required to publish crime reports under the Clery Act of 1990.
The data indicates a decline in burglaries and robberies between 2011 and 2013 but shows an increase in forcible sexual assaults over the same period. Burglaries fell from 83 cases in 2011 to 28 in 2013 and robberies dropped from 34 cases to 17. Forcible sexual offenses increased from 24 cases to 33 over the same period. Disciplinary referrals for liquor law violations more than doubled from 200 cases in 2011 to 563 cases in 2013.
Vice Provost for Student Affairs Ainsley Carry said that the increase in reported sexual offenses is expected as the university has taken steps to make the process of reporting such crimes easier and more accessible.
“We’ve created a culture and environment where people should feel safe reporting [sexual assault],” Carry said. “We know that our numbers should increase.”
Carry said that he expects the numbers to decrease as the university continues implementing cultural and educational programs aimed at reducing sexual violence on campus.
The report breaks down the crime statistics for the University Park campus into four geographic zones: on-campus, student housing, public property and non-campus. Public property includes streets, sidewalks and parking facilities, while non-campus includes off-campus student housing and other university buildings outside campus boundaries. Crimes reported directly to LAPD are also included in a separate category.

The School of Social Work’s Center for Innovation and Research on Veterans and Military Families (CIR) has welcomed visiting scholar Eyal Fruchter for the next year. Fruchter, former head of the mental health department of the Israeli Defense Force, will teach about and research post-traumatic stress disorder and related topics.
The CIR is a new, innovative research center at USC.
“It is a center that is housed in the USC School of Social Work that aims to help the transition of veterans and families into the community,” said Claudia Bustamante, a spokeswoman for CIR. “We do that through innovative research, educational training, community global engagement … [and] building partnerships with other leaders in the area.”
The CIR, which was founded in 2009 and has grown “tremendously” in its five years according to Bustamante, does research on a multitude of contemporary military issues, including how service affects sexual functioning and post-traumatic stress disorder.
Fruchter, who has had significant exposure to the world of military health, explained how his experience relates to the interests of CIR.
“I am a psychiatrist by profession, and I worked in the Israeli Defense Force first as a military doctor and then as a psychiatrist, and until two months ago I was the head of the mental health division of the IDF,” Fruchter said. “We did a lot of work on post-traumatic stress disorder and its ramifications … So, for the last several years I’ve been working on PTSD, both its prevention and treatment.”
Fruchter said that factors as simple as the length of a soldier’s tour can drastically increase his or her chances for suffering from the illness.
“We have much fewer cases of PTSD in the IDF [than in the US] … due to several factors, but the main one is probably the length of the mission,” Fruchter said.
Mandatory military service as required by the Israeli government also plays a role in reducing PTSD, noted Fruchter.
“I didn’t have to change anything in the way that I coped, and everybody knew what I was talking about,” said Fruchter about his ability to express himself healthily to his friends and family.
Fruchter said that this is different than the American military, where soldiers often know little about the areas where they are stationed, or know of other people who have gone through the same struggles in the service.
“American soldiers come from homes where some of them [don’t] know what’s going on [in] the theater and they’re gone for a year … you learn to cope alone, and when you come back home nobody knows what you’ve been through,” Fruchter said. “It’s very hard for people from the outside to understand what you’ve been through.”
Fruchter believes that this tension between the expectations and realities for soldiers returning from duty is one of the main causes of PTSD.
“Your friends expect you to be the friend that they had … [but] people have a very hard time adjusting to being sent away and then again to come back … that I believe is the core problem causing war post-traumatic stress disorder,” he said.
But Fruchter thinks that the work he and the center are doing can help.
“I believe that if we manage to bring in the research that I want to do this year with connection to the IDF [that] we will find several ways that will be most helpful in presenting PTSD and treating it … We’ve progressed quite a bit in several aspects but now we need to see clinically working.”
 
 
William makes a point I hadn’t considered, although I’m also curious about the questions raised by this program in taking on a former IDF officer regarding WHO suffers from post-traumatic stress. While our conversations on post-traumatic stress tends to revolve around how it affects soldiers, I hear relatively little about work being done in the US on the problem of post-traumatic stress among the civilian populations living in the countries which these soldiers have been sent to occupy. I’d love to hear someone contradict me, that this program is interested in the problem of post-traumatic stress more widely, but I’m worried that their hiring of Eyal Fruchter signals their commitment to humanizing the soldier while largely ignoring those populations terrorized by US and Israeli militaries.
Steven, No one is more guilty of terrorizing those populations that its own people.
The following was written by a Muslim apostate:
So, the question now is that who is the real enemy of the
Arab world?
The Arab world wasted hundreds of billions of dollars and
lost tens of thousands of innocent lives fighting Israel, which they considered
is their sworn enemy, an enemy whose existence they never recognized. The Arab
world has many enemies and Israel should have been at the bottom of the list. 
The real enemies of the Arab world are corruption, lack of
good education, lack of good health care, lack of freedom, lack of respect for
the human lives and finally, the Arab world had many dictators who used the
Arab-Israeli conflict to suppress their own people.  These dictators’ atrocities against their own
people are far worse than all the full-scale Arab-Israeli wars. 
In the past, we have talked about why some Israeli soldiers
attack and mistreat Palestinians. Also, we saw Israeli planes and tanks attack
various Arab countries. But, do these attacks match the current atrocities
being committed by some Arab states against their own people.  In Syria, the atrocities are beyond anybody’s
imaginations? And, isn’t the Iraqis are the ones who are destroying their own
country? Wasn’t it Tunisia’s dictator who was able to steal 13 billion dollars
from the poor Tunisians? And how can a child starve in Yemen if their land is
the most fertile land in the world? Why would Iraqi brains leave Iraq in a
country that makes 110 billion dollars from oil export? Why do the Lebanese
fail to govern one of the tiniest countries in the world? 
And what made the Arab states start sinking into chaos?  Their backward-looking and barbaric religion.
I’d be curious if those IDF soldiers who are part of “Breaking the Silence” or other ‘refuseniks’ are treated with regard to a mental health issue or one of insubordination by the chain of command.
While Muslims in Syria kill women, children, elderly indiscriminately – up to 40,000 people and counting – we devote our anger on Israel for we are anti-Semites in sheep’s clothing.
While Muslims have killed up to one million in Sudan, and counting, we devote our anger on Israel for we are really just anti-Semites pretending we are humanitarians.
While Muslims in Mali have forced 500,000 (and counting) people into refugee status – as they have done in the past year – we devote our anger on Israel for we are anti-Semites pretending to be for social justice.
While Muslims kill off what remains of the ancient Hindu population in-and-around Pakistan we devote our anger on Israel for we are like the Germans during the 1930s – people who needed a convenient scapegoat to escape their own feelings of frustration.
While Muslims have wiped out all the Buddhists from their ancient homeland in Afghanistan we devote our anger on Israel for it’s easy to pick on Jews and we are shameless hypocrites engaging in man’s oldest prejudice, anti-Semitism, while pretending to be holier-than-thou.

At Tuesday’s Undergraduate Student Government meeting, USG’s University Affairs Committee proposed a resolution to extend the deadline for USC students dropping a course or changing their grade option to pass/no pass. Director of Academic Affairs Nicole Schrad, Assistant Director of Academic Affairs Maariyah Patel and Greek Senator Providence Illisevich presented the resolution to the USG Senate.
Read and report · Greek Senator Providence Illisevich presents a resolution arguing for a later course drop date at USC. – Kevin Fohrer | Daily Trojan
Current USC policy gives students three weeks after the start of classes to drop a class or change from pass no pass without getting a mark of “W” on their transcript.
The proposed resolution would extend this deadline by several weeks.
University Affairs began research for the resolution in early September. They based their research on U.S. News & World Report’s college rankings. These rankings showed that the national average final date to drop a course is over 46 percent of the way into the semester, whereas USC’s date is 20 percent of the way into the semester.
“These numbers came from quantitative analysis,” Patel said. “Percentages were used to account for the difference between semester and quarter system.”
The resolution argues that students are unable to evaluate how successful they will be given the short amount of time they have to drop courses or change the grade evaluation.
“Students may be reluctant to pursue other courses of study,” the resolution said.
Proponents are also concerned that the current policy negatively impacts USC students’ transcripts, making them less competitive.
“This policy directly impacts USC students’ transcripts and places students at a competitive disadvantage upon entering the professional world and applying to graduate school,” the resolution said.
“The last week to add classes will still be the third week,” Patel said.
Students who drop after the deadline will be unable to get their tuition money back. The presenters believe, however,  that the benefits outweigh the potential risks.
“This is so that students have the most competitive transcripts,” Schrad said.
Schrad said she was inspired to create the resolution after her friend, a student at Stanford, told her about the advantages of an extended deadline.
“He was really happy that [Stanford] gave him so much time to change his grade option,” Schrad said.
Schrad and Patel were unsure of why USC’s deadline policy is different than that of other universities.
“I think it was one of these policies that was established early on, with not too much thought given to it,” Patel said. “When we presented it to [Vice Provost of Undergraduate Programs] Gene Bickers, he was surprised, as if no one had ever brought it up before.”
Bickers was an early proponent of the resolution. He gave University Affairs his approval for research in early September and encouraged the committee to pursue work on project.
“He was really excited about it,” Schrad said.
If approved, the resolution will be forwarded to other university officials, included President C.L. Max Nikias.
USG will vote on approving the resolution next Tuesday.

Provost and Senior Vice President for Academic Affairs Elizabeth Garrett will leave USC to become the 13th president of Cornell University, effective July 1.
Farewell · Garrett will leave her current position as vice provost after the end of the academic year on July 1. Garrett, who also holds an appointment at the Gould School of Law, will join the faculty at Cornell as well. – Daily Trojan File Photo
Garrett, who has held her current position at USC since 2010, will serve as Cornell’s first female president. She will succeed President David J. Skorton, who is leaving Cornell to assume a position as secretary of the Smithsonian Institution.
“I am honored by the confidence that the board has placed in me to lead Cornell, and I am excited to work with the faculty, students, staff and alumni to continue and enhance their commitment to academic excellence; their influential involvement in research and education throughout the world; their long tradition of egalitarianism, inclusion, and public service; and their deep engagement with New York,” Garrett said in a statement.
Cornell led a six-month national search before appointing Garrett as the university’s next president. Chairman of Cornell’s board of trustees, Robert Harrison, said that he is proud to welcome Garrett as the university’s next president.
“[Provost Garrett] has not only distinguished herself as an inspirational leader, thinker and scholar, but she also embodies the values and traditions that have placed Cornell at the forefront of the increasingly global field of higher education,” Harrison said in a statement. “She is going to be a great president.”
Garrett came to USC in 2003 as a professoriate. She served as USC’s vice president for academic planning and budget before becoming the university’s second-ranking officer and first female provost. Garrett was also named the Frances R. and John J. Duggan Professor of Law, Political Science, Finance and Business Economic and Public Policy.
As provost, Garrett is responsible for overseeing the Dornsife College of Letters, Arts and Sciences and USC’s professional schools. She also supervises the divisions of student affairs, research, libraries, information technology services, student religious life and enrollment services.
During her time as Provost, Garrett has recruited administrators and faculty members from across the academic disciplines. She has also accelerated the recruitment of the Provost Professors, created the Provost’s Postdoctoral Scholars Program in the Humanities and helped to develop the USC Strategic Vision: Matching Deeds to Ambitions.
President C.L. Max Nikias, who has worked alongside Garrett on his senior leadership team for nine years, spoke highly of Garrett’s accomplishments at USC.
“I am personally thrilled for Provost Garrett, who has served the USC community with exceptional dedication since 2003,” Nikias wrote in a letter to the USC community. “[S]he has proven to be a remarkably dynamic leader, showing boundless energy in advancing the university’s initiatives, and a singular gift for innovative and tactical thinking. She will be deeply missed at USC.”
Vice Provost for Student Affairs Ainsley Carry praised Garrett’s leadership skills.
“I have been in college administration for 20 years, worked for some great people and Liz Garrett is by far the best boss I have ever had,” Carry said. “She is rigorous, thoughtful, considerate and extremely hard working. So today is a sad day for me. But that sadness is balanced by my pride and happiness for her.”
Carry said that Nikias will begin working on a transition plan in the coming weeks.
“We lost a great provost who has done a lot of incredible things at USC. But we are such a great institution of higher education and we are going to look for the next best thing to her,” Carry said.
Garrett received her B.A. in history with distinction from the University of Oklahoma and her J.D. from the University of Virginia School of Law. Before joining USC’s faculty, Garrett was a professor of law at the University of Chicago, where she also served as deputy dean for academic affairs. Before entering the academic field, Garrett served as budget and tax counsel and legislative director for then-Oklahoma Sen. David L. Boren, and also clerked for Justice Thurgood Marshall on the U.S. Supreme Court.
 
 
Sincere congratulations to SVP Elizabeth Garrett for her appointment as the 13th president of Cornell University. The best wishes of the Trojan family goes with her.

USC’s men’s golf team finished in a tie for first place with Oregon at the Itani Collegiate in Pullman, Washington, on Tuesday. To determine a winner of the tournament, the teams engaged in a playoff, where the Ducks reigned supreme after one hole. The Trojans finished at 6-under par for a final round score of 834 (273-270-291).
Sophomore Rico Hoey finished the tournament in third place with a final score of 5-under 205 while junior Bobby Gojuangco and freshman Jonah Texeira finished tied for 10th with a score of 1-under 209. Freshman Sean Crocker moved up 13 spots on the final day to finish in a tie for 19th place with a score of 1-over 211.
Some highlights from the first rounds of the tournament on the men’s side included sophomore Rico Hoey tying for first overall with Oregon’s Aaron Wise with a 9-under 131. Hoey had 10 birdies and only one bogey in the first two rounds. Gojuangco finished the second round tied with Texeira for ninth. Seniors Eric Sugimoto and Paul Smith ended Monday in 48th and 26th respectively; Sugimoto was 3-over while Smith was 1-under.
The Women of Troy, meanwhile, completed the ANNIKA Intercollegiate Tournament in Orlando, Florida. The team finished in sixth place with a three-round combined score of 5-over 869 (287-291-291). They finished behind a top five which consisted of South Carolina, Arizona, Oklahoma State, Stanford and Duke respectively. Sophomore Karen Chung and senior Doris Chen tied for 11th after the final round with a score of 1-under 215. Sophomore transfer Elizabeth Doty tied for 25th with a score of 3-over 219 for the tournament.
Both teams also had impressive opening two rounds of their respective tournaments. After 36 holes, the men’s team was in second place with a combined score of 17-under 543 (273-270). This left them trailing Oregon by two but one ahead of host Washington State and seven ahead of both California and Arizona State.
The Women of Troy finished their second round in fourth place with a combined 2-over 578 (287-291). In a crowded field, the women’s team trailed first-place South Carolina by six, Arizona by five and Northwestern by three. Oklahoma, Stanford and defending NCAA champion Duke all finished the second round tied for fifth, one back of USC.
Chen ended the second round tied for fourth at 2-under 142, finishing the round with a consistent 10 pars in a row. Chung was in 12th after Monday with an even 144. Junior walk-on Victoria Morgan had the flashiest shot of the day when she hit her first career hole-in-one on the par 3 seventh hole. Morgan called it “the shot of her life.”
Despite a few impressive shots, USC’s women’s team finished the tournament in the middle of the pack. Though the Women of Troy seem to have fallen off from when they won a school-record eight events last season. But head coach Andrea Gaston remains optimistic.
“[T]his was a nice oportunity to see some of the depth on our team,” Gaston said. “This was also our first tournament of the season. Obviously we would have liked to have finished better, but since most of our players haven’t competed for almost two months, we are pleased that all players contributed to the team score.”

To call the women’s volleyball team’s match against Washington today a rivalry game is a bit of an understatement. Though UCLA certainly still occupies the spot of Public Enemy No. 1 for Trojan sports in general, this battle between the Huskies and the Women of Troy is sure to be a particularly emotional one considering the last time these two teams met.
USC was hosting Washington in the quarterfinals of the 2013 NCAA Division I national championship tournament. The No. 3 seed Huskies had just won the Pac-12 with an 18-2 record in conference play and had won both regular season matchups against the sixth-seeded Women of Troy, who finished 16-4 in the Pac-12. If the usual playoff atmosphere wasn’t enough, Washington was hosting the final weekend of the NCAA tournament in Seattle, meaning a third win against USC would earn the Huskies a chance to play for a national championship in their home gym.
With so much at stake, and the pressure clearly on Washington, the Women of Troy were obviously going to come out motivated. Sure enough, the match had the perfect conditions for an upset as the Women of Troy took the first two sets and needed just one more to steal a spot in the semifinals.
I vividly remember reading the updates from the official volleyball team Twitter account during the game. I put a lot of thought into making the short walk from my dorm room in Pardee Tower to the Galen Center to watch it, but the match was right in the middle of final exams, so I spent the night studying and tweet watching instead.
I’m not sure if my lack of loyalty had anything to do with it, but the Women of Troy couldn’t finish off the Huskies. Washington stormed back and took the next three sets to win the match, dramatically ending the Women of Troy’s national championship hopes.
I don’t think the timing of USC’s trip up to Seattle could have been better, because USC is in need of a big game. A team that was expected to look a lot like last year’s national quarterfinalist, if not better, has instead looked far from that. But there’s still plenty of time for the Women of Troy to get back on track, and a win in Washington would do just that.
The Women of Troy came in as the No. 5 team in the country according to the American Volleyball Coaches Association preseason poll, one spot behind Washington. Though the Huskies have hung tight at No. 4, USC has slipped all the way down to No. 19 according to the most recent poll, after losing five of six matches, including all four matches the team has played at home this year.
The rough patch began with a 3-2 loss to then-unranked Texas A&M, then a 3-0 loss to then-No. 10 Florida at home. After dropping a 3-1 match to then-No. 4 Wisconsin then beating an unranked Maryland team in straight sets on the road, the Women of Troy lost in three sets to No. 20 UCLA and in four sets to then-No. 19 Arizona State at home.
The sweeps to Florida and UCLA are not as bad as the set totals would indicate. Florida won 25-23, 25-23, 25-22 and UCLA won 25-23, 25-13, 27-25. So save for one set against the Bruins, the Women of Troy were right in those two deceptive losses. Though a little more back-and-forth with a 25-23, 15-25, 25-27, 25-13, 16-14 score, the Texas A&M match is another one that so easily could have been a victory.
The 21-25, 25-17, 25-17, 25-21 loss to Wisconsin was not as close as the other three, but the fact that USC can get a set off of last year’s national runner-up is a good sign. It’s harder to find a silver lining from the loss to the Sun Devils, so I’ll chalk that up to the frustration and disappointment from the other four losses snowballing into a fifth one.
There are some deeper problems as I look at the stat sheets from the five defeats, and stats can reveal if poor performance is linked to a high number of unlucky mistakes or to more endemic problems.
There are plenty of different things to look at, but I’ll focus on hitting percentage. It’s no surprise that USC has had a lower hitting percentage in all five losses, the closest being .318 to .273 against Arizona State  and the worst being .320 to .173 to Wisconsin. What’s surprising and somewhat discouraging is that there hasn’t been a huge disparity in attacking errors.
Besides against Texas A&M, when USC had 28 attacking errors to the Aggies’ 15, the difference in errors has been marginal, if not positive. The edge was 15 to 13 against Florida, 16 to 15 against Wisconsin and an even 17 to 17 against UCLA. USC actually had fewer errors than Arizona State, when the Women of Troy had 17 and the Sun Devils had 22.
Essentially, it doesn’t look like the team is making a bunch of mistakes early on that will balance out over the course of the season; it just seems like the team is getting outplayed on offense and defense.
Underperformance doesn’t necessarily mean this team is less talented than everyone thought. In fact, the Women of Troy are still ranked higher than two of the teams they lost to, so the AVCA voters must think the team potential but just hasn’t meshed yet.
It’s a very young team, with 11 underclassmen and five upperclassmen. The best of the bunch is yet to come as chemistry continues to grow, and the team just needs some energy to get over this rough patch.
That’s why this trip to Washington is so well-timed. It will be impossible for the Women of Troy to walk into the Huskies’ gym without being motivated to avenge last year’s heartbreak. Plus, unranked Washington State should not pose much of a problem on the second match of the trip and USC should come home on a winning streak even if the Huskies prove to be too strong.
But I’m feeling good about Washington. Call it blind faith, but faithful is one of the five traits of a Trojan, so what else would you expect from the student newspaper? I didn’t have faith last year and the team suffered a heartbreaking defeat, so here’s to some faith resulting a huge turnaround.
USC in five.

After a 6-0 start to the season, USC’s women’s volleyball team (7-5) has fallen flat, going only 1-5 since. The team remains winless on its home floor (0-4) and has won only seven total sets since Sept. 6. The Women of Troy (7-5, 0-2 Pac-12) hope to shift the momentum to their side during a two-match road trip to Washington to take on Pac-12 rivals No. 4 Washington on Wednesday and Washington State on Friday.

The Women of Troy have lost some close contests recently. In the last six matches, USC has dropped 11 sets by five points or fewer. Service errors have been a major weakness for the Women of Troy, who have given up 55 points on service errors in the last six matches alone. As a result of the losses, USC has tumbled down the NCAA rankings to No. 19.
Despite a tough couple of weeks, individual players on the Women of Troy continue to impress this season. Junior outside hitter Samantha Bricio continues her dominance on offense, leading the team with 151 kills and 39 service aces. Bricio has also been a force on defense, collecting 125 digs.
Freshman outside hitter Lauryn Gillis ranks second on the team with 108 kills and has recorded 103 digs.
Sophomore libero Taylor Whittingham and senior setter Hayley Crone have also been leaders in the dig column for the Women of Troy, with 152 digs and 101 digs, respectively. There are also seven players on the Women of Troy with a double-digit number of total blocks, including junior middle blocker Alicia Ogoms, who leads the team with 44 blocks.
The Women of Troy have a great opportunity to prove why they should still be considered a top team in the nation against No. 4 Washington. The Huskies have had a much easier schedule than the Women of Troy this season, but the Huskies have proven they belong where they are at this point in the season with wins against BYU and Wisconsin, which are teams ranked in the NCAA Top 10 rankings.
The unbeaten Huskies (13-0, 2-0) will bring a strong offensive presence, led by outside hitter Krista Vansant who has a team-high 198 kills on the season (4.30 kills per set, which ranks 24th in the nation). Outside hitter Kaleigh Nelson, who has 126 kills on the season, will be the other main offensive threat from the Huskies.
Defensive specialist/libero Cassie Strickland has provided strong defense for the Huskies, totaling a team-high 143 digs this season.  But Strickland is also statistically the worst server on the team, recording 37 service errors so far this season. Middle blocker Lianna Sybeldon will also be a player to watch for in the match as she is productive on both defense and offense. She leads the Huskies in total blocks with 81 and has contributed on offense with 86 kills.
Washington State (9-5) should be the easier contest for the Women of Troy during their two-match road trip. The Cougars are winless in Pac-12 play, and they have lost their last three matches, albeit all three came against teams in the NCAA Top 25 rankings. Nevertheless, the Cougar squad boasts a lot of talent.
Outside hitter Kyra Holt, middle blocker Chelsey Bettinson and outside hitter Jaicee Harris have dominated the offense for the Cougars, with all three  producing kill numbers in the triple-digits this season. Bettinson also leads her team in blocks with 73. Another player the Women of Troy will need to keep an eye on is defensive specialist/libero Kate Sommer, who has recorded far more digs than any of her teammates with 194.
With all the tough losses at home, head coach Mick Haley said that going on the road might actually help his team start winning matches again.
“I just think when you get in a situation like this, you want to play again as soon as possible,” Haley said. “We were just in a bad place here for a couple of weeks. I don’t know that it’ll be any easier on the road. The good thing is, when you travel, you’re all together and you’re together for the whole time. That might, in fact, give us some advantages to get a little bit tighter as a team while we’re traveling. I think, basically, we just got to keep working on our fundamentals and keep improving individually.”
Haley also stressed how October will be the most crucial month of the season for his team.
“I think all of the matches in October are going to be critical because by the end of October, we’re going to know whether we’re going to challenge for this [NCAA] tournament or not,” Haley said. “Whether we can challenge for the Pac-12 conference, I don’t know, but we want to get in the NCAA tournament and get a chance to play for the championship. So, we have to earn that right, probably in October.”
Today’s match at Washington begins at 7:30 p.m. Friday’s tilt against Washington State kicks off at 6 p.m. Both matches will air live on Pac-12 Networks.

The No. 16 USC football team hit the practice field again on Tuesday to continue preparation for Arizona State. The Trojans didn’t know it at the time, but they will be playing against a Sun Devil squad without its starting quarterback, as ASU’s Taylor Kelly is out for the second straight week with a foot injury.

Madden on the Move
Redshirt junior tailback Tre Madden reappeared on the depth chart ahead of USC’s game against Arizona State this Saturday. Madden suffered turf toe in training camp this fall and has yet to clock any playing time for the Trojans thus far. Madden is listed as the third tailback on the roster behind redshirt junior Javorius “Buck” Allen and sophomore Justin Davis.
“It’s very frustrating,” Madden said Tuesday following his first practice back in full pads. “But it’s football so we’ll see how it goes.”
When asked about the possibility of redshirting this season, Madden deferred the question, saying it would require talking to coaches and team doctors.
USC head coach Steve Sarkisian had said earlier in the season that Madden should be ready by the Oregon State game, but he has been experiencing a lot of pain.
“It takes a long time to loosen up, and it’s sore all the time,” Madden said. “It is one of the most frustrating things I’ve been through.”
Last year, Madden was USC’s second-leading rusher, posting 703 rush yards in 11 games.
Blackout?
Redshirt junior wide receiver Victor Blackwell has been absent from practice recently. Blackwell is the latest player in the Trojan football program to draw less-than-desirable media attention to the field.
“We haven’t seen him in over two weeks,” Sarkisian confirmed Tuesday. Blackwell had not received any playing time since the first game of the season against Fresno State, in which he caught three passes for 54 yards.
Unfortunately, this USC football team is starting to get used to these kinds of controversies, but Sarkisian is staying firm on his stance.
“There is no limbo to be in,” Sarkisian said. “If he decides to come meet with me, then we will talk about it.”
Sun Devil Saturday
The Trojans will face their first Pac-12 South opponent Saturday when they host the Arizona State Sun Devils at the Coliseum. ASU is 3-1 and currently ranked fourth in the Pac-12 South. The squad is coming off a 62-27 Thursday night loss to UCLA that resulted in it dropping out of the AP Poll completely.
Every team USC faces in Pac-12 South play, including ASU, has the Saturday before it plays USC off.
“Everyone is getting a couple more days to stare at us than [we get to] stare at them,” Sarkisian said.
Despite the abnormality of the situation, redshirt junior quarterback Cody Kessler doesn’t see a change in preparation.
“We had a good balance of running and passing and that’s what we need for this offense to be successful,” Kessler said. “And I personally prepare week in and week out to be prepared for anything they throw at us.” One of the most highly touted Sun Devils is junior running back D.J. Foster. Foster is averaging 135 yards per game on the ground.
Sarkisian emphasized Foster’s versatility, naming a laundry list of things he does well.
“He can run it, he can catch it out of the backfield, he can catch it as a wide receiver, and he is hard to tackle,” Sarkisian said. “He’s all over the place.”

Once again, a Fox News host has made an insensitive remark on air, leading to national outrage. This time, however, it is not just average citizens who are upset; members of the U.S. military are also furious. Last week, Fox News host Eric Bolling referred to the United Arab Emirates’ first female fighter pilot, Mariam Al Mansouri, as “boobs on the ground” because she is a woman. Not only did Bolling make a ridiculously sexist comment, but his colleague, Greg Gutfield, also made a joke about Al Mansouri’s inability to park her aircraft because she is a woman. “After she bombed it, she couldn’t park it,” Gutfeld said.
In response to Bolling’s comments, Fox News began receiving letters from viewers, including the military, chastising him for his insensitivity. According to New York Magazine, Bolling apologized, saying, “I’m sorry for what I said. I believe that Major Al Mansouri is a hero. She’s courageous, brave and she deserves our praise and not inappropriate jokes. She has my admiration and my very, very sincere gratitude.” Gutfield, however, did not directly apologize for his comment. Instead, he quipped that viewers should know he “makes very hacky jokes knowing that they are hacky.” On top of that, he added, “And of course, women in the UAE can drive. That’s the real joke …They can drive, and I can’t. I don’t even have a driver’s license.” It’s an understatement to characterize these comments as upsetting.
According to New York Magazine, male and female American veterans involved with the Truman Project wrote an open letter to Bolling and Gutfield in which they said the hosts’ remarks about Al Mansouri were “unwarranted, offensive, and fundamentally opposed to what the military taught [them] to stand for,” and that the attitudes expressed by these two might potentially weaken the fight against ISIS.
“We need to send a clear message that anyone, male or female, who will stand up to ISIS and get the job done is worthy of our respect and gratitude,” read the open letter.
With this outrage from the military, however, questions of sexism’s portrayal in the military arise. There has always been an inclination to deny women the right to serve in the military, as evidenced by the years of struggle it took for them to finally be allowed into the military. Because of the stereotype that women cannot handle the physical and emotional rigor of the military, a culture of sexism has arisen within the ranks, despite the best efforts of those trying to combat it. According to USA Today, the struggle to make sexism equivalent to that of racial slurs has been in progress for almost two years. The permissive environment that has been created, however, seems to have trickled down to even the military academies where, if such issues are not dealt with soon, the culture of sexism within the military will only get worse.
According to Time, the Pentagon found this year that sexism is routine in military academies. In fact, there have been incidents at West Point and the Air Force involving documents or emails that were offensive to women, and apparently, “many students at the academies see sexual assault and crude behavior as an almost accepted part of their academy experience.” For some people, though, the experience of programs similar to Reserve Officers’ Training Corps in college was better than in high school.
According to the Harvard Crimson, Carolyn F. Pushaw, one of the university’s Naval ROTC students, said that when she was in high school, she took part in a military-style program that was not connected to ROTC. She found it to be a somewhat negative experience.
“There was surprisingly a lot of sexism,” Pushaw said. Pushaw also “found that in ROTC it’s a lot more equal.” While everyone’s experience in ROTC or the military academies might be different, there could very well be a correlation of differences in regards to the amount of sexism displayed in ROTC as compared to military academies.
Though Fox News failed in an attempt to convey the news because of the network’s misogynistic and insensitive comments, the need to address sexism in the military is essential. The comments are a reminder that the media is not the only breeding ground for sexism. The lift of the ban on women to serve on the front lines last year has been a step in the right direction for gender equality, but there is still a long way to go. Hopefully, with stricter programs cracking down on gender inequality and sexism within the military, the institution can continue to grow positively and continue being the incredible force that valiantly serves this country so selflessly, to which we are all thankful for. As Secretary of Defense Leon Panetta said in regard to women who are allowed to serve on the front lines, it is “the responsibility of every citizen to protect the nation.” The need to respect women has never been more crucial.

It is very intriguing to read the comments on every non-conservative opinion post on the Daily Trojan. The same self victimization the machismo conservatives claim to hate is pouring into each of these articles. It baffles me to see people sympathize with sexist comments because chastising ignorance, “has ruined much of the freedom of expression us adults grew up having.”
Chelsea, please stop “Chasing Equality.” You risk to ruin white male privilege. ;)
It seems the DT censored and removed my two other comment postings, having to do with the hate speech by Cal muslim students against jews, and calling for the murder of jewish folks.  Seems the DT and the university have their opinions pointed in the wrong direction.
Chelsea… Unfortunately your support for women and “gender equality” is completely overshadowed by your apparent disdain for Fox News… not to mention your ignorance in not understanding the difference between a news broadcast and a news-opinion show.  For the record, I’m not exactly delighted by the comment made by Bolling, but he was not anchoring a news broadcast.  As a previous reader noted, it’s a program called “The Five”, a deliberately opinionated program where the hosts, and their guests, express THEIR opinions on the news and current events.   Such programs exist on all the news channels (MSNBC, CNN, etc), not just Fox News.  The rhetoric on such shows swings from serious to comical purposely, and is intended to engage and stir debate.  I would submit that even hosts of programs like that should be careful and judicious in their commentary, but it is wholly unfair and incorrect to state (as you did in your article) that they represent the “network’s misogynistic and insensitive” point of view.  Again, your hate for the network was more clearly conveyed than the rest of this somewhat feeble article.
Second… I’d like to share a truth with you and anyone else reading:  STOP CHASING EQUALITY.  It’s the wrong goal.  Instead, CHASE FAIRNESS.  They’re not the same and shouldn’t be because things in nature are rarely equal.  Men and women (for example) are so very different, and bring so many different and wonderful things to life that are unique to each gender.  We should celebrate and embrace the differences.  Rather than the constant push for all things to be equal, we should seek to make things fair.  Sometimes that will result in things being equal, and sometimes it won’t.
Finally… As you are a senior majoring in English, I’m alarmed at some of the clumsiness in your writing.  For example:  “… to which we are all thankful for” might read more correctly as “for which we are all thankful”.  I know it sounds harsh, but as you get older you will discover that your argument (weak or strong) will be better received when articulated well.
Chelsea, van you repost your commentary about the MSNBC hosts who’ve been fired or not for her vulgar comments about politically Conservative women, the statements about Sarah Palin, the filth of the liberal view on late term abortions, etc? 
Bolling’s statement in jest and he apologised. Gutted doesn’t need to apologize just because some emotionally sensitive twits got their feelings hurt. He’s a jokester and anyone who watches The Five  or his evening show know that.
It’s unfortunate, that the western world has had to force us into a PC world. It has done nothing but ruin much of the freedom of expression us adults grew up having.
Why hasn’t the DT staff written an article about the hateful demonstration that the Muslim students and their advisors held on the UC Berkeley  campus the other day calling for the death of Jews and the destruction of Israel?
You kids are missing the point about a lot of serious events going on in the world.  So sweating the small stuff and focus on the destruction of male global cities due to the acceptance of a multicultural society.  See Brussels, Paris, London, Dearborn MI, Soon NYC.
Geez.

College app season — that time of year is here once again. Nationwide, high school students and parents alike are now getting ready for the quest to find a perfect fit for the next four years. More often than not, the search begins with rankings. Early last month, U.S. News  & World Report released the latest edition of its “Best Colleges” list, widely accepted as the go-to for college rankings.
Irene Wang | Daily Trojan
USC placed 25th on the U.S. News rankings this year, but placed fourth on the list of schools with the most billionaire undergraduate alumni, recently released by Wealth-X and UBS Billionaire Census. In fact, the obsession with rankings has spurred new lists based on all kinds of criteria; everything from best dorm food to most beautiful campus to highest starting salaries of recent graduates. In light of the increasing number of rankings, it’s hard to tell which lists have real merit.
Biased and trivial, the criteria for the U.S. News rankings have little to do with actual student satisfaction and more to do with schools’ reputations and historic prestige. “Undergraduate academic reputation” accounts for a whopping 22.5 percent of the weighing in the ranking formula.  This reputation doesn’t come from undergraduate student input, but rather from an assessment by top administrators — deans, presidents and provosts — of peer institutions. This creates a cycle in the rankings process: Top academics evaluate a peer institution based on its reputation, which was established in the prior year’s rankings, which in turn prevents schools from moving dramatically up or down in the rankings during any given year.
Finances also play a large part in the U.S. News ranking methodology. Faculty resources, financial resources and alumni giving rate add up to 35 percent of the total weight. Financial resources are judged by per-student spending, but U.S. News doesn’t account for the fact that high per-student spending is often funded through high per-student tuition.
Not coincidentally, some of America’s “top colleges” are also those known for their costly tuition. The high demand for top schools means that they can get away with exorbitant prices.
Blatantly absent from U.S. News’ criteria are factors like affordability and student satisfaction. Including these factors would force colleges into a competition to improve themselves for their students. If affordability were a factor, colleges would set costs that would better help students out, and the rankings system would inspire competition that benefits students. Instead, schools are rewarded for their financial and faculty resources.
Perhaps the most pointless criterion for the ranking is the “selectivity” factor. Just as how “undergraduate academic reputation” creates a cycle of rewarding the same schools, the selectivity factor makes it harder for new schools to break into the top list. When a school is named one of America’s top colleges, more students will apply there, increasing the selectivity. This lowered rate of admissions will then help the school in the next year’s rankings, and since the school remains on the top list, its selectivity rate will remain high.
Obviously, these rankings should mean more to the schools themselves than to students looking for prospective colleges. The U.S. News and World Report ranking system is essentially just a way for elite colleges to pat themselves on the back and justify rising tuition costs.
Simply comparing the U.S. News rankings to rankings that utilize different criteria exemplifies this. For example, the Washington Post recently released a list of the colleges that graduates had the highest average starting salaries, which seems more helpful to students than endowment or selectivity. Not a single one of the top 10 schools on the Washington Post’s list were Ivy League universities, which made up half of U.S. News’ top 10.
Unfortunately, many high school students rely heavily on well-known rankings like U.S. News during their college search process. Most students don’t apply exclusively to top 10 schools, but many students rely on the rankings when choosing their “dream schools.” Just because a school received the number one ranking, however, doesn’t mean it should be everyone’s number one choice. Top schools won’t necessarily be the best choice for every student. For instance, Caltech (ranked 10th) might not be the best option for an English major.
When choosing a school, students should ignore the rankings and focus on factors like environment, academic programs for their specific major and affordability. Instead of allowing U.S. News & World Report to tell them which school is the best, students need to do their own research and attend a school that will meet their personal needs and interests — regardless of that school’s rank.
 
Erin,
People know Caltech isn’t a school for softology majors. That’s where they learn about things such as sending biga55 space shuttles 100’s of thousands if not millions of miles into space. You know that black and white space craft across the street, with NASA on it, that was literally piggybacking off of a commercial jetliner sometime last year? That’s what Caltech deals with. English don’t teach you that; but I’m sure all universities offer courses on English.
Don’t get so bent out of shape with these biased, unscientific, and non quantitatively concluded rankings. It’s a game. And who cares if that school across town beat us, or the fact that London Times FAVORS them over us? They’re a CA school, and because of their “in state” tuition they will always be favored over us and be “the most applied to” school. But that may change in the next few years as the UCs are trying to attract more out-of-state and international students…Oh wait, we already do that WELL.
Last thing, Harvard and Stanford got the highest concentration of influential, game-changing, disrupter, billionaire alumni. So maybe SC falls in 3rd place after these two like you stated.

Provost and Senior Vice President for Academic Affairs Elizabeth Garrett will leave USC to become the 13th president of Cornell University, effective July 1.
Provost and vice president for student affairs Elizabeth Garrett will become Cornell University’s first female president effective July 1st. — Daily Trojan File Photo
Garrett, who has held her current position at USC since 2010, will serve as Cornell’s first female president. She will succeed President David J. Skorton, who is leaving Cornell to assume a position as secretary of the Smithsonian Institution.
“I am honored by the confidence that the board has placed in me to lead Cornell, and I am excited to work with the faculty, students, staff and alumni to continue and enhance their commitment to academic excellence; their influential involvement in research and education throughout the world; their long tradition of egalitarianism, inclusion, and public service; and their deep engagement with New York,” Garrett said in a statement.
Cornell led a six-month national search before appointing Garrett as the university’s next president. Chairman of Cornell’s board of trustees, Robert Harrison said that he is proud to welcome Garrett as the university’s next president.
“[Provost Garrett] has not only distinguished herself as an inspirational leader, thinker and scholar, but she also embodies the values and traditions that have placed Cornell at the forefront of the increasingly global field of higher education,” Harrison said in a statement. “She is going to be a great president.”
Garrett came to USC in 2003 as a professoriate. She served as USC’s vice president for academic planning and budget before becoming the university’s second-ranking officer and first female provost. Garrett was also named the Frances R. and John J. Duggan Professor of Law, Political Science, Finance and Business Economic and Public Policy.
As provost, Garrett is responsible for overseeing the Dornsife College of Letters, Arts and Sciences and USC’s professional schools. She also supervises the divisions of student affairs, research, libraries, information technology services, student religious life and enrollment services.
During her time as Provost, Garrett has recruited administrators and faculty members from across the academic disciplines. She has also accelerated the recruitment of the Provost Professors, created the Provost’s Postdoctoral Scholars Program in the Humanities and helped to develop the USC Strategic Vision: Matching Deeds to Ambitions. 
President C.L. Max Nikias, who has worked alongside Garrett on his senior leadership team for nine years, spoke highly of Garrett’s accomplishments at USC.
“I am personally thrilled for Provost Garrett, who has served the USC community with exceptional dedication since 2003,” USC President C.L. Max Nikias wrote in a letter to the USC Community. “[S]he has proven to be a remarkably dynamic leader, showing boundless energy in advancing the university’s initiatives, and a singular gift for innovative and tactical thinking. She will be deeply missed at USC.”
Garrett received her B.A. in history with distinction from the University of Oklahoma and her J.D. from the University of Virginia School of Law. Before joining USC’s faculty Garrett was a professor of law at the University of Chicago, where she also served as deputy dean for academic affairs. Before entering the academic field, Garrett served as budget and tax counsel and legislative director for Oklahoma then-Sen. David L. Boren, and also clerked for Justice Thurgood Marshall on the U.S. Supreme Court.
