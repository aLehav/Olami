The Super Bowl is the most-watched event of every year in the United States. With an audience of more than 100 million viewers, the first Sunday in February has essentially turned into a national holiday. 
When the U.S. Women’s National Soccer Team won the World Cup this past July, fewer than 20 million people watched the final match. 20 million — for the finale of a worldwide tournament available to an audience of billions. That’s a shamefully low figure.  
While the 2019 NBA Finals brought in an average of 20.5 million viewers per game, the 2018 WNBA Finals averaged just 481,000.
The obvious theme here is that attention to women’s sports as compared to men’s is problematically low. This may be a product of tradition, but in a modern society where gender equality is emphasized, it just does not make sense.
This topic hits close to home for me. I’ll never forget when Jackie Thomas, the dean of students from my high school, would highlight accomplishments or talk about the importance of women in sports on a weekly basis. Before I met Thomas, I never paid much attention to women’s sports and thought few others did. Since  it was unusual for me to see someone so passionate about it, I decided to see for myself why Thomas made such a big deal out of female athletes.
I quickly discovered that I had a hard time recognizing different women players and teams. It was shocking to see how little media attention women’s sports received compared to men’s. I understood why Thomas always tried to push for recognizing female athletes and their accomplishments — she had to do it because no one else did. 
And that’s exactly the problem. 	
My whole life, I have been a sports fan, but not once could I remember sitting down and watching a full women’s professional sports game. Was that a subconscious yet intentional decision? Or was it because women’s sports were rarely shown on TV in the first place? Either way, I concluded that women in sports need the recognition and celebration that they deserve.
The first game I ever covered at USC was a women’s soccer game — and honestly, the only reason I even chose to do so was because I had to cover at least two games before I could work football. I was looking forward to getting it over with more so than actually enjoying it. 
But instantly, I was hooked.
Watching one of the best women’s soccer teams in the nation made me realize how hard every athlete trains and why it is so important to appreciate all college athletes, regardless of gender. The team didn’t attract as many attendees or as much recognition as it deserved, but the players couldn’t care less. They were just as passionate and excited as any men’s team I’ve seen. 
Last spring, three of USC’s women’s teams (water polo, lacrosse and beach volleyball) won their respective conference championships, whereas only one men’s team did so. Unfortunately, without looking it up myself, I would have never known.
Even at the college level, where Title IX tries to equalize men’s and women’s sports, many of the latter are neglected. I recall covering a USC women’s basketball game that had an attendance of less than 300. There is no excuse for this. 
Similarly, the University of Connecticut’s women’s basketball team is one of the most dominant college teams ever. In its 2016 championship game, in which the Huskies  capped off an undefeated season, fewer than three million people tuned in. 
Why? The easiest explanation is media coverage. 
Media has an overwhelming influence in the modern world. From presidential elections to sports, media brings attention to almost every aspect of today’s society. Because the media hardly focuses on women’s sports, people lose focus and forget about a significant portion of the sporting world. Men’s sports, on the other hand, get the lion’s share of media coverage — and thus, almost all the nationwide attention.
It falls on fans to recognize and appreciate all athletes, regardless of gender or what sport they play. Today, every athlete puts in a tremendous amount of hard work, but only a small fraction of those athletes are actually celebrated. 
Hopefully, women’s sporting competitions will attract audiences on par with those of men in the coming years. It won’t happen overnight, but with more effort from fans and the media, who knows? Women may one day dominate the world of sports.

After waiting seven months to get back out on the field, this week of practice marks the final stretch before the Trojans’ home opener against Fresno State this Saturday. Having practiced against each other for so long, there’s a new energy with the Trojans, symbolized by President Carol Folt’s presence at practice. 
Senior wide receiver Michael Pittman Jr. expressed the importance of the Trojans starting the season strong. A win this weekend would help garner momentum and set the tone for the rest of the fall.
“People have been jawing about ‘SC Sucks, ‘SC’s this, ‘SC’s going to win five games again,’” Pittman said. “So I’m ready to play and ready to prove them wrong.”
WIDE RECEIVERS
This is the deepest wide receiver group Pittman has played with, and the veteran said it will make his job easier. The defense can’t target and double team him because if they do, they’ll be creating an opening for other receivers like redshirt juniors Velus Jones Jr. and Tyler Vaughns and sophomores Devon Williams and  Amon-Ra St. Brown. 
In preparing for both the opener and the season as a whole, the Trojans will be focusing more on themselves than on their opponents. 
“It’s all about us, we don’t really care what they do,” Pittman said. “Obviously we look at them and scout them, that’s what every good team does.” 
The Trojans aren’t looking back; it’s all about the here and now. But Pittman said things haven’t changed too much from last year. The team is more physically built than it was last year, but the biggest difference is that the players are working harder. 
“Everything feels the same to me,” Pittman said. “Football is football, nothing really changes. I think we just have more confidence and our quarterback has more confidence. We’re all just ready to play football.”
OFFENSIVE ATTACK
The coaching staff created the quarterback depth chart based on who was most consistent, and head coach Clay Helton has confidence in all three scholarship quarterbacks. Sophomore starter JT Daniels used the same phrase as Pittman that “football is still football,” referring to changes from last year. One difference is Daniels’ role as a leader on the team. 
Along with having more experience, Daniels is also more vocal. Offensive coordinator and quarterbacks coach Graham Harrell taught him the importance of energy, saying that “the most excited team wins.” He’s still not a “rah-rah guy” but now leans more toward that end of the spectrum than being a “quiet guy.” 
In the spirit of consistency, the Trojans won’t be changing what they do on the field week-to-week, no matter how good the upcoming opponent. The plays the offense will run are from the spring playbook. Helton said the simplicity of the new system will allow younger players to step up. From Daniels’ end, the Air Raid system requires less thought; he can just go out and execute. 
Harrell expects his group to improve every single day, and week by week he expects them to play better as the team continues to gel. That camaraderie is key to Harrell’s offense. Feeling comfortable with the players next to you is just as important as individual talent.
Harrell has placed a lot of responsibility on the offensive line, which will set the tone for both the physicality and the tempo of the offense. His expectation for the offense is to dominate the line of scrimmage. 
“They’re not going to be the ones that get written about in the paper, they’re probably not going to be talked about on the news, but the reason we’re successful or not successful is going to fall on them,” he said.  
INJURY REPORT
Redshirt freshman inside linebacker Solomon Tuliaupupu will lose another season to recovering from a surgery on his foot he had prior to coming to USC. Once healed, he’ll have four years left of eligibility, making him an older player which can certainly be an advantage, and he’ll have the opportunity to be healthy, which is the most important thing, Helton said. 
Freshman wide receiver Bru McCoy’s waiver has not been cleared yet. He will likely not play this Saturday, as the NCAA is not expected to make a decision before the game.

University at Buffalo’s Charles “Chip” Zukoski will serve as provost and senior vice president for academic affairs at USC starting Oct. 1, President Carol Folt announced Tuesday in a letter. 
“Dr. Zukoski brings to USC extensive experience overseeing professional schools, the arts and humanities, and the health and medical sciences,” Folt wrote. 
Zukoski was selected from more than 300 names to follow Michael Quick, who left the University in April to return to teaching and research. He will replace Elizabeth Graddy, who has served as interim provost since July 1. 
Zukoski worked at UB as both provost and executive vice president for academic affairs. Before then, he served as vice chancellor for research at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.
“[These experiences] exposed me to these questions about how to educate students, how to hire faculty, how to enroll students, how to make sure they are retained and are successful in getting their degrees, how educational programs begin to evolve as they face the future and the altering economy and the geopolitics of the world,” Zukoski said in an interview with the Daily Trojan.
As provost, Zukoski will oversee all 23 professional schools. His responsibilities will focus on admissions and enrollment services, budgeting, campus well-being and academic and faculty affairs, among others. According to Folt, Graddy will assist with Zukoski’s transition as she resumes her role as executive vice provost.
Zukoski said his goals for the next year are three-fold: building trust and understanding the students and faculty and stakeholders at USC, strengthening the University’s educational and research programs and increasing the impact USC has on its neighboring community in South L.A. 
“[We want] to begin to address the large problems the neighborhoods face from health disparities to sustainability and water to access to food and housing,” Zukoski added. “How can USC, with its research and scholarship capacity, have an enhanced impact there?”
Zukoski said though his plans with Folt are in the preliminary stages, he aims to help move the University forward with the rest of the administration. According to Zukoski, working with the administration, faculty, students and staff on issues at USC is what attracted him to assume his position. 
“I see an institution with a tremendous tradition, tremendous history … and then I see these issues, and I say, ‘OK, we’ve got to work on them,’” Zukoski said. “Understanding how those issues came to be and what we need to put in place to make sure all those problems don’t reemerge is very important but as important is reestablishing bringing everyone together so we all know we want to move forward because we have these common goals.”
Zukoski’s time at UB was marked by growth and recognition. University at Buffalo received its highest rankings from U.S. News and World Report during his tenure. It has been named among the top 50 schools in the country every year since 2013. The university received its highest ranking from the publication in 2018 when it was ranked No. 38. 
Zukoski also helped with efforts to restructure University at Buffalo’s general education program, improve graduation rates and increase and diversify the student body. 
Despite his successes at UB, Zukoski’s time at UB was also marked with controversy. UB’s student newspaper The Spectrum reported that some community members protested against wages for teaching assistants and graduate assistants at UB and petitioned for a $21,310 minimum stipend. In September 2017, Zukoski addressed a crowd of about 100 protesters and said, “It is difficult for me to reach in at the provost level and just say, pay them more,” The Spectrum reported.
Student leaders later met with Zukoski and administrators at a private meeting, where he said graduate and teaching assistants made well above a living wage, the newspaper reported. 
Zukoski earned his bachelor’s in physics from Reed College in 1977 and his doctorate in chemical engineering from Princeton University in 1985. 
Zukoski was chosen by a 17-member search committee chaired by professor Mark Humayun, which included faculty, staff, students and members of the Board of Trustees’ Academic Affairs Committee, Folt wrote.
Undergraduate Student Government President Trenton Stone said the provost search process was an improvement from the presidential search committee, which didn’t include student input. 
He was able to review applications and voice his and other undergraduate students’ opinions at meetings he attended in-person and over phone call throughout the summer. In the future, Stone said he’d also like to see more student voices on these committees.
“Given there’s a number of faculty on the committee, and the provost is the chief academic on this campus, I do think it would be helpful to have just one more undergrad and graduate at least … just to make sure that it’s not just one undergraduate perspective there,” he said. “It never hurts to have another.” 
In the letter, Folt wrote she expects Zukoski’s experience will provide a new perspective for the University.
“In Dr. Zukoski, we have found an active partner to help advance the University by building on our breadth and depth and seeking new opportunities for impact and leadership,” Folt wrote. “He is knowledgeable about all aspects of the university and cares deeply about the welfare and needs of the faculty, staff and students and the communities we serve.”

No. 5 USC women’s soccer put on an impressive show this past week, achieving two shutouts in Honolulu against Hawaii and San Francisco. The Trojans defeated Hawaii 3-0 Thursday before handing San Francisco a 2-0 loss Saturday.
The talents of both the Trojans’ new and returning starters were on display against Hawaii. Sophomore forward Penelope Hocking wasted no time in setting the pace for the Trojans’ attack. Last year’s Pac-12 Freshman of the Year, Hocking scored just 10 minutes into the game off a deflected cross from junior forward Tara McKeown, bringing her total to 15 career goals in just 21 games as a Trojan. McKeown, who had six goals and seven assists in 20 starts last season, found her way around two defenders and landed a shot in the far post to give the Trojans a 2-0 halftime lead.
The Trojan defense stifled Hawaii throughout the game, conceding only five shots to the Rainbow Warriors. After freshman midfielder Savianna Gomez scored for the Trojans with just five minutes to go, redshirt junior goalkeeper Kaylie Collins saved a penalty kick to preserve the 18th clean sheet of her career.
The Trojans had far more chances to score than the Rainbow Warriors, earning 11 shots on goal compared to just three for Hawaii. Two of these chances — including the penalty kick and a last-minute shot snatched up easily by Collins — came after USC had already amassed a three-goal lead.
Thursday’s offensive performance was even more impressive given the absence of junior midfielder Savannah DeMelo, who posted 9 goals and 10 assists in 21 games last season but may not return this year due to an Achilles injury. Hocking and McKeown will have to continue to collaborate on the front line to lessen the impact of DeMelo’s absence.
“It’s just a true testament to who we are as a team,” head coach Keidane McAlpine said of his team’s ability to create chances, no matter who is on the pitch. “Many of our players were willing to step up … It’s been a team effort.”
The Trojans have now won three straight season openers and are 5-1 in openers under McAlpine.
“It helps when you have great players who are willing to work hard in order to win,” McAlpine said.
McAlpine added that the return of experienced players, including Hocking and Collins, was a major contributing factor to the team’s success in the opener.
The Trojans were dominant again against San Francisco Saturday night, despite being short-handed.
Unlike on Thursday, the Trojans started the game slowly, failing to convert on any of their opportunities in the first half. San Francisco’s senior goalkeeper Olivia Camera was strong between the goalposts, finishing the day with 10 saves. It took a penalty shot from redshirt senior utility player Natalie Jacobs to revitalize the Trojan offense 10 minutes into the second half.
In the 83rd minute, McKeown picked up her second goal in two games to seal the deal for the Trojans. Following the victory, the Trojans advanced to a 2-0 record for the third consecutive year.
“It’s great to be able to sustain dominance,” McAlpine said. “It’s a testament to who we are as a team. The [players] being able to dedicate themselves to practice [and working] hard during the offseason has helped contribute to our success.”
Following these two decisive victories, the Trojans show no signs of slowing down as they host Florida Thursday for “The Battle at the Banc”. The teams kick off 8 p.m. at Banc of California Stadium.

Saturday ushered in a long-anticipated college football season with a marquee matchup between the Miami Hurricanes and Florida Gators. The Gators, ranked No. 8 to start the year, pulled out a narrow victory in a back-and-forth contest in the highest-rated regular season game on ESPN in three years. 
This should’ve been the biggest story in football yesterday, but it wasn’t — not by a longshot. In fact, what should have been the most hopeful and celebratory day for the sport was derailed by devastating news. The early retirement of Indianapolis Colts quarterback Andrew Luck dominated the weekend’s headlines, and for good reason.
Luck, 29, was one of the sport’s brightest young stars and a consensus top-five player at football’s most important position. He’s less than a year removed from leading the Colts back to the playoffs after missing the entire 2017 campaign with a shoulder injury. In fact, it was only a few months ago that Luck picked up his fourth Pro Bowl appearance and was voted AP’s NFL Comeback Player of the Year. Luck was also voted by his fellow players as the 20th best player in the league last season, according to NFL Network’s annual poll. 
Since Calvin Johnson’s shocking retirement in 2016, no player has left the game in the prime of his career, especially not at Luck’s position or caliber. By all indications, Luck was a player at the top of his game — a true team leader who seemed capable of leading Indy to its first Super Bowl victory in over 12 years. 
This was the fate Luck was destined for — that is, until ESPN’s Adam Schefter first broke the news of his retirement on Twitter during the Colts’ preseason game Saturday night. Soon after, some confused and angry Colts fans at Indy’s Lucas Oil Field booed Luck as he walked off the field. A few minutes later, with tears in his eyes, Luck officially announced his retirement in an emotional postgame press conference, citing mental wear and tear from constant injury and rehab. 
This is an obvious concern for the NFL. Luck’s situation is an omen in a league and sport where the question of long-term viability is increasingly prevalent in the minds of players, team personnel and league executives. And while the sport’s long-term physical consequences are well-documented in recent years, this is one of the first instances of a Pro Bowl-caliber player blindsiding the football world with his retirement.
Luck has battled injuries for the better part of his career. He missed over 25 games in three seasons before his comeback last year. Players from around the league, like Richard Sherman and J.J. Watt, have expressed their support for his decision. He’s a tough, well-respected man and player, despite what your weird, couch-sitting, never-played-a-day-in-his-life neighbor might say about Luck’s fortitude. 
The most cynical of football fans will argue that Luck will be fine. After all, he’s got a degree in architectural design from Stanford and nearly $100 million in on-field earnings from his seven years with the Colts. Hell, who knows, he could come back in two years and take over for a freshly-retired Tom Brady in New England. Or he could sign the biggest deal in history with the upstart XFL, of which his father is the commissioner. He can’t really be done — can he?
He most likely is, and good for him. Not many of us have the courage to walk away from something we love, especially something that’s defined us for most of our lives. He’s paid his dues, and he’s reaped the consequences of an illustrious, if unexpectedly short, career in the NFL. 
Either way, Luck’s retirement comes as a huge blow for fans who have loved watching him play with the pure passion and joy that he brought every weekend since his days at Stanford. For players, he was exactly the kind of guy you want to play with: smart, tough, kind and deeply empathetic. In fact, he was well-known throughout the league for his tendency to congratulate opposing players after they tackled him or picked him off. That’s how much he loved the game and the people who played it.
That joy is gone, or at least diminished to the extent that he decided to retire, and that’s a terrifying prospect for a dangerous sport built on passion.

Students crowded McCarthy Quad as they waited for Maryland rapper YBN Cordae to perform his headlining set at Saturday’s Welcome Back Concert. The annual concert, held by the Concerts Committee, drew over 7,000 attendees — almost 1,000 more than the year before. 
Cordae, whose debut studio album “The Lost Boy” peaked at No. 13 on the Billboard 200 chart, began his headlining set around 10 p.m. with his single “Have Mercy.” Immediately after, he brought Josh Heredia, a junior majoring in business administration, on stage from the crowd. 
“I’m a big fan of Cordae and his music, and if someone were to tell me that on my first weekend at ’SC I would be called onstage by him, I would never have believed them,” Heredia said. “[It was a] night I will never forget.”
Due to Cordae’s relatively short discography, his set only lasted 40 minutes, which combined “Lost Boy” tracks like “Bad Idea” and “Thousand Words” with songs from “YBN: The Mixtape” such as “Target” and “Alaska (Scotty Pippen).” 
After playing “Kung Fu” twice, Cordae mouthed “Just drop it” to his DJ, prompting the opening sample of his Anderson .Paak-assisted track “RNP,” marking his first time playing the song live by himself. 
“YBN Cordae brought the energy, we matched it, opened up some pits and I lost both of my shoes,” said Mya Davis, a freshman at the Iovine and Young Academy. “It was great. I found them after the show, but the whole thing was amazing.”
Before Cordae jumped on the stage for his headlining set, London-based singer-songwriter Ama Lou opened the concert alongside her drummer and keyboardist. The 21-year-old performer’s set was met with mixed reviews, with some students using their phones as flashlights to wave alongside her music, while others talked over the set as they waited for the headliner of the night.
“When she started performing, I was like ‘… This girl can really sing,’” said Pilar Lee, a freshman majoring in journalism. “I’m definitely going to listen to her music more now … She can perform, she has the vocals and she has the moves.”
Compton native and Shady Records signee Boogie took the stage to “Silent Ride,” during which he shed his neon FUBU jacket and jumped down to perform up against the barrier that stood between the stage and the crowd. 
Accompanied with powerful visuals from his music videos, Boogie’s half-hour set primarily consisted of cuts from his album “Everythings For Sale,” including an acapella performance of  “Lolsmh,” a duet of “Swap Meet” with girlfriend BJRNCK, a singer from Chicago, and “No Warning,” which he dedicated to late rapper Nipsey Hussle.
Toward the end of his set, Boogie announced he wanted to “try something new,” warning students in the front to leave if they didn’t want to get injured. 
He then instructed the audience to separate into two sections, and after a brief countdown, the students charged toward each other, colliding into an impromptu mosh pit.
Overall, the concert received acclaim among students, with some of the attendees considering it better than those of previous years.
“I was here freshman year when Migos came, so I haven’t been to the front of the stage in a while,” said Andrea Williams, a senior majoring in media arts and practice. “We were actually up front this time, and then they started doing mosh pits again, which was not fun, but generally was a good time.”
As students waited for the concert’s acts, they were able to grab meals from food trucks parked along McCarthy Quad, including West Side Bahn Mi, The Boba Truck and Fat Sal’s. Additionally, The Fields LA provided students with free sandwiches, tacos and falafel.
Sponsorship booths also lined the area, handing students free merchandise. WAV, an app that live-streamed the concert and was one of the event’s primary sponsors, distributed free posters and long-sleeve shirts, while Bumble handed out branded fanny packs, bandanas and hats students wore throughout the event.
The Concerts Committee’s tent drew a long line with its wheel of prizes, offering students the chance to win pins, stickers and free tickets to upcoming concerts in Los Angeles. On the opposite end of the quad from the stage were interactive art installations, including a giant white tent with performance artists sitting inside and an entertainment room with live-streamed feeds.
“This was the smoothest show I’ve been a part of, we had the show live-streamed which had never happened before, and everything went smoothly with artists,” Concerts Committee co-executive director Leila Kashfi said.

A former University employee filed a suit July 5 against USC and a University Auxiliary Services executive, saying she was subjected to a hostile work environment “of crude, male-dominated culture,” that felt “more liken [sic] a frat house than a professional office environment,” according to the lawsuit.
Rachel Lamb said she endured sexual harassment, sexual discrimination, sexual battery, retaliation in violation of the Fair Employment and Housing Act and intentional infliction of emotional distress from her immediate boss, Joe Furin, when she worked as an hourly employee at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum from September 2016 to April 2019. 
She filed the suit against the University and Vice President of Auxiliary Services Daniel Stimmler in L.A. Superior Court.
The lawsuit alleges that Furin fostered a hostile and misogynistic work environment where he and upper management officials “failed to hold male employees accountable for unprofessional behavior.”
When asked for comment, Stimmler referred the Daily Trojan to University Media Relations. The University wrote in a statement that it could not comment on the specific case due to ongoing litigation but said that it is taking the allegations seriously.
“The university was unaware of these allegations until the lawsuit,” the statement read. “Because the litigation is in an early stage, we are unable to discuss details about the case. But we are thoroughly investigating and look forward to defending the matter. The university treats any and all allegations with great care and is deeply committed to maintaining an environment that is free from harassment.”
At her first work event, a USC football game, Lamb was informed that they were present at the hospitality suite to serve and network with clients, but her coworkers and bosses were dressed casually and inappropriately drinking and talking among themselves, the lawsuit read. 
According to the suit, this atmosphere of unprofessionalism was representative of the work events throughout her employment. 
During her first week on the job, Lamb found that both director of sales Anastasia Johnson and chief business development officer Mitch Huberman were underqualified and incapable of performing their basic job responsibilities — neither could operate without daily supervision, and Huberman was “computer illiterate,” the suit read. Lamb reported this to Furin who then delegated their responsibilities to her, it said.  
Lamb had to serve as an assistant to Huberman and alleges she spent her time doing his direct work. But, despite taking on these responsibilities, she still made the same hourly wage, the suit read. 
During this time, Lamb frequently felt that her personal space was violated and that Huberman was making unwelcome advances — he would offer her alcohol from his personal collection. The suit alleges that the hostility increased after she reported these incidents to her boss. 
“Huberman would invite Lamb to his office under the premise of troubleshooting his computer and then would offer her alcohol from his collection behind his desk, wanting to sit and talk,” the suit read. “She informed Furin about these incidents but Furin did nothing to address the situation.”
According to the suit, Lamb met with Furin several times to discuss her concerns regarding her uncompensated workload, and Furin reportedly assured her that she would be promoted and compensated in time. 
Eventually, Lamb’s position was reclassified to special projects administrator. But because Lamb was now a salaried employee, she could no longer collect overtime pay for the extra work she was doing, the suit read.
The suit also alleges that Stimmler “engaged in and tacitly condoned sexually harassing and discriminating conduct toward Lamb” and other employees. 
Stimmler became flirtatious with Lamb, according to the suit, and by her third year working for him, his actions increased from “tight hugs and grabs around the waist to sexual assault and battery.” 
On occasion, Stimmler, often while allegedly drunk, would catch Lamb off guard and kiss her on the mouth without consent and disregard her protests, the suit read. Stimmler also allegedly made jokes at Lamb’s expense, commenting on Lamb’s appearance as well as his own marital status. 
During this time, the suit said Lamb began experiencing health issues, including symptoms of nausea, anxiety, heart palpitations and chest pain. 
“Lamb sought medical and psychiatric treatment … [and] met with Furin and Human Resources on multiple occasions to disclose her medical conditions,” it read.  “[They] failed to respond to Lamb’s requests for administrative action and support, which resulted in her ongoing illnesses that persisted until her employment terminated.”
The suit alleges that Lamb believes Furin and Stimmler “reclassified her position in retaliation for her not going along with the fraternity-like culture of the workplace that eventually led to Lamb’s sexual assault and battery.”
 The case’s next hearing date has not been set. 
This article was updated on Aug. 27 at 9 a.m. to include the latest statement from the University regarding the lawsuit.

Nestled between the School of Architecture and the Roski School of Fine Arts lies what used to be the Nekter Juice Bar. Now, it’s a USC-owned and operated cafe called C&G Juice Co. where  students can enjoy a revamped menu of healthy bowls. The soft opening for the cafe was Aug. 22. 
Similar to Nekter, C&G Juice Co. will serve juices, smoothies and açai bowls. According to Garry Marschall, senior associate director of USC Hospitality, the team felt they could create a space that serves healthier and cheaper options on the go. 
“We were with Nekter for five years and believed that we could do this ourselves and do it better,” Marschall said. “I was approached about this idea before looking at the contract and when it would end … and then we decided that we should look at when this [new cafe] would be viable for us.”
Marschall explained that although the products will be similar, USC Hospitality is working on elevating C&G Juice Co.’s ingredients and efficiency. He said the University used to purchase frozen açai packs from Nekter, which would take longer to blend. The new cafe will instead use products from the açai company Sambazon, which provides semi-frozen açai to make service quicker without compromising the texture or flavor. 
“Instead of taking an açai bowl between three to five minutes to make because of all the blending, we are now able to do it in one to two minutes, so the speed of service will be much quicker with basically the same product,” Marschall said. 
The menu isn’t finalized, but Marschall said ingredients in the cafe’s three main products range from vegetables like kale and spinach to fruits like pineapples and mangos. To develop their own signature drinks and smoothies, Marschall said the cafe received help from a research and development chef and the previous manager of Nekter. 
He also said School of Architecture dean Milton Curry and Roski dean Lynn Kirk played a role in several taste tests, since the cafe will be located in their schools.
The restaurant will also partner with various companies to sell items that aren’t available at other food vendors on campus. USC Hospitality is collaborating with local company Positive Foods to provide fresh salads and meal replacements. The cafe will carry vegetarian and vegan options from Café Gratitude, an organic, plant-based food chain. According to Marschall, the cafe will also sell fresh roasted coffee from Intelligentsia Coffee and make its own orange juice. 
Naaman Bautista, USC Hospitality’s food service assistant manager, said the cafe will also emphasize sustainability by selling glass mason jars that customers can bring back to refill their drinks with a one-dollar discount. 
Those who bring their own reusable cups get a 25-cent discount. The cafe will also use paper straws instead of plastic ones. 
“Right now, sustainability and affordability is our motto moving forward,” Bautista said. “It’s really important for the Trojan Family that all of the healthy, sustainable and affordable concepts are being met.” 
In terms of pricing, Marschall said that the C&G Juice Co.’s costs are similar to Nekter’s and on average $3 cheaper than SunLife Organics, another bowl and smoothie store in the USC Village. Juices will range from $6.79 to $7.99, smoothies will be $7.89 and açai bowls will range from $9.99 to $11.99. 
Cash transactions won’t be accepted at the cafe. Marschall said USC Hospitality analyzes transaction counts when looking at each unit, and the Nekter Juice Bar had the lowest number of cash transactions on campus. 
Kris Klinger, assistant vice president of USC Hospitality, said he is not worried about the possible competition with SunLife Organics. Instead, the team is more focused on providing a convenient location for students to purchase healthier food options. 
“We have açai bowls at Popovich Café, but besides that we don’t [have healthier options,]” Klinger said. “We look at competition as a great thing and that everyone has their own space to operate and work in. But [SunLife Organics] is less of a concern to us — it’s more important that we make sure that we’re meeting the needs of the students.”
