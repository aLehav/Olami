Undergraduate Student Government Director of Academic Affairs Eric Miller gave a presentation focused on USC libraries and the implementation of fall break at the meeting of the Undergraduate Student Senate Tuesday night in the Ronald Tutor Campus Center.
Besides future renovations of Leavey Library, Miller argued that increasing awareness of the many, overlooked libraries available on campus would benefit students the most. He said Catherine Quinlan, dean of USC Libraries, was one of the figures spearheading the publicity effort.
“[Quinlan] is one of the most fantastic ladies on campus,” Miller said. “She does so much for the University in kind of publicizing the resources that are available to students today, and one of the ones that is lacking the most is access to all of the different libraries.”
Miller said the majority of students are not aware of other libraries besides the most popular ones.
“If you ask the average student, they’re going to know Leavey, Doheny and maybe the library of their major,” Miller said. “That is something that I really wanted to change just because my favorite [library] on campus is the philosophy library. It is the most beautiful building on campus, and I absolutely love it. What’s a shame is that it’s never crowded while Leavey, [which] is not necessarily the most aesthetically beautiful building, [is] always packed.”
Miller said the lack of knowledge about other libraries is likely due to Leavey’s convenient hours and lack of publicity about other locations, something he hopes to address.
“I think that the more education you have, the more likely it is that a student will take the time to explore the engineering library [or] the architecture library in between classes,” Miller said.
Otherwise, Miller said students may lose time by going to inconveniently located but better known libraries.
Miller also spoke about the proposed fall break and the progress USG has made in its advocacy.
“I think [fall break] is one of those things we’ve put in the right amount of work to really make the administration think,” Miller said. “The administration is absolutely on the students’ side, but at the same time, it is a really big change to affect the academic calendar.”
Miller explained that though students come first at USC, creating a fall break poses multiple challenges.
“What [the Academic Senate] wants to make sure they protect is having enough days in the semester to teach their kids,” Miller said. “They also want to make sure they have time for research and [the] ability for not only the teachers but also the students to have a long Christmas break … It’s not just bumping two [days] forward on the calendar and bumping two days back -— you do really have to factor in every possible impact that a fall break would have, but I really do believe that we’ll come to a really good conclusion.”

USC’s implementation of the new General Education curriculum, which took effect with this year’s freshman class, has led to an increase in classes. USC students have noticed the changes in class scheduling, particularly in the amount of Friday classes that have been added in several of the University’s departments.
The increase in classes is due in part to the need to offer courses to students who are still completing the previous General Education graduation requirements while offering new courses to the incoming class, according to registrar Frank Chang.
The Office of the Registrar has been pushing for faculty to begin spreading their courses out across the five-day week to ameliorate the shortage of space and class capacity issues USC has been experiencing.
“To offer more courses, the University must use its classroom space efficiently, which means that courses must be offered every day of the week,” registrar Frank Chang said. “A Monday to Friday academic week allows students to spread out their classes, as opposed to having to cram all courses over two or three days.”
Some departments have experienced more of an uptick in the amount of Monday, Wednesday and Friday classes that are required for students to complete their major.
“This is the most loaded Friday class schedule I’ve had at USC,” said Sophia Gatsios, a senior majoring in international relations.
Gatsios noted that some of her friends in the major have shared her experience.
“If there aren’t any more options I think people will eventually move into the [Friday] sections and accept them,” she said.
The School of International Relations in Dornsife was more receptive to changes in class scheduling. The director, Richard English, said the department has shifted several course sections to Friday.
“We’re scheduling the classes and timing them without prejudice,” English said. “We have popular and important classes that are also being scheduled Monday, Wednesday and Friday. So in some cases you can’t avoid — if you want to be an IR major — taking some of them.”
Though English noted that there has been some initial grumbling from students about enrolling in sections of courses scheduled on Fridays — especially Friday afternoons — he said the department as a whole has not experienced major problems with the changes. This fall, the international relations department has approximately 350 students enrolled in Friday classes and does not anticipate that number decreasing in future academic semesters.
“We cannot see any trends [in which] it’s hurting our enrollment or people are choosing other majors or not taking the classes they need because of this,” English said.

Caroline Ryder, a graduate student at the School of Cinematic Arts, has been accepted into the inaugural Screenwriters Lab hosted by Hedgebrook — a nonprofit organization committed to empowering female writers — in partnership with Humanitas.
“Hedgebrook is a literary nonprofit that supports the work of visionary women writers whose stories and ideas shape our culture now and for generations to come,” the organization said in a press release.
Established in 1974, the Humanitas Prize recognizes film and television writers who explore the human condition through their work. The organization occasionally partners with other nonprofits, such as Hedgebrook, to advance its mission.
Ryder was accepted to the program after a rigorous round of multiple applications and interviews. Out of 130 applicants, only five were chosen to join the retreat.
This is the first time that Hedgebrook is partnering with Humanitas to create the retreat. The retreat, which will take place on Whidbey Island, Washington, will include access to writing space as well as mentors to help the participants in the writing process.
“Each writer lives in her own cottage, and meals are prepared by in-house chefs,” Hedgebrook said in the press release. “Post-residency, screenwriters will be connected with Hedgebrook’s growing community of women in the film industry who can help bring these projects to fruition.”
Ryder said she initially wasn’t going to apply for the lab.
“My roommate, Zak Shaikh, a working screenwriter and also a USC screenwriting M.F.A. grad — he graduated [eleven] years ago — mentioned the Hedgebrook workshop to me in passing, just one day before the application deadline,” Ryder wrote in an email to the Daily Trojan.
With little time to complete the first stage of the application, Ryder was surprised when she saw that she made it to the second round. Each writer had to send a copy of the screenplay she intended to work on during the retreat as part of the first stage of the application process and reflect on the screenplay for the second stage of the process.
“The second round application process was very involved and took quite some time and a lot of thinking and soul-searching,” Ryder said.
Ryder said she had to talk about her movie more in-depth during the second stage of the application.
“I had to answer, in detail, a long list of questions about my script, ‘Mimi and Ulrich,’ — questions about the tone of my film, the core audience, the theme, the main relationships, the protagonist’s internal and external goals, the central conflict and the narrative question of the film,” Ryder said.
Ryder admits that her experience as a graduate student of the School of Cinematic Arts gave her the necessary experience and skills to be selected.
“My writing and script analysis teachers gave me a core understanding of how to write stories for film,” Ryder said. “I learned that good scripts don’t happen by accident — they demand an understanding of the rules, as well as courage to follow your own instinct and not get bogged down in the rules. It’s a tricky balance. The critical studies classes gave me a much needed sense of film context. The business classes gave me a broad understanding of the industry.”
Ryder will be attending the retreat at the end of October.
“I’ll be spending Halloween in the woods,” she said.

The Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum sported 150 new “eco stations” at the first 2015 USC football game against Arkansas State in an effort to forward the new “zero waste” initiative. In collaboration with USC’s Office of Sustainability, the 90,000-seat venue transformed its trash cans into recycling and compost bins.
Brian Grant, director of operations at the Coliseum, explained how some types of packaging at the venue must be changed, but that overall, the compost and recycling streams seemed to work. They generated a greater volume of recyclables and compost materials than expected at the first game.
“We saw a lot of people really make that split-second decision to recycle what was recyclable and compost the others,” Grant said. “It’s such a huge help to have that kind of engagement from our patrons because without them, this initiative would be so much more challenging.”
Sustainability program manager Halli Bovia explained how decreasing stadium waste has been a goal since 2012.
“We’ve always had the vision of reducing waste and going for a zero waste stadium,” she said.
“Zero-waste” is defined as diverting 90 percent or more of waste materials from landfills through composting, repurposing and recycling. Food vendors at the Coliseum now use environmentally-friendly cutlery, cups, napkins, boxes and trays, which will all be composted. After about three to four weeks of decomposition, the materials are sold as premium compost to Central Valley farms.
Grant said that when he started at USC in 2013, all waste was treated like mixed trash.
“It was immediately evident that we had to establish a new system for our waste, so I started working with Halli to see what the Coliseum was capable of in terms of diversion,” he said.
Grant hopes that the initiative will create a more sustainable future for the Coliseum.
“The Coliseum has one of the longest and most prestigious histories in the country. It’s our responsibility to make sure that we manage the facility in a way that both honors that history but also focuses on a sustainable future,” Grant said. “We hope that this initiative helps create a long-term culture of environmentally sustainable practices at the Coliseum.”
Minimizing the environmental impact of the ninth-largest college football stadium in the country has become a priority for the Office of Sustainability.
“These events have large waste footprints or large geological footprints,” Bovia said. “Reducing the impact has a dual purpose in both reducing a significant waste impact and reaching several thousand people in one location. It gives us the opportunity to do this with some higher visibility.”
Bovia also said it will be hard to move these eco-stations to campus because it is increasingly more difficult to control the materials people bring to campus from home. It is easier to manage waste disposal at the closed stadium.
On opening day, signs in the L.A. Coliseum and messages on social media showed fans how to dispose of their trash. Fans were also encouraged to take part in the Tailgate Waste Diversion program, which involved around 350 educators and volunteers helping recycle aluminum cans as well as glass and plastic bottles.
USC has been part of the Green Sports Alliance since 2013, a nonprofit dedicated to teaching healthy, eco-friendly practices to sports leagues, teams, venues and fans.
In 2008, USC created the Office of Sustainability to improve sustainable practices on campus. The office also develops outreach programs for the university and the local community. A group of students, faculty and staff works together on strategies to facilitate these sustainable activities.

It is hard to miss a 6-foot-1,  320-pound behemoth in a crowd, but nose tackle Antwaun Woods finds a way to make it happen.
Though Woods is big in stature, it is not surprising how people can still overlook him entering into his fifth year on campus. He is not brash nor does he try to bring attention to himself.
He is respectful and quietly goes about his business on and off the field. In fact, he does this so well that when he is playing at his best, other players often reap the rewards of his hard work. Welcome to the life of a nose tackle.
If you ask Woods, he wouldn’t have it any other way.
“We’re the tough guys on the field,” Woods said. “We make life easier for everyone else.”
Football has always been a bottom-line business. Numbers often rule a player’s value, and at first glance, Woods is just another player on the field.
Last season, Woods finished the 2014 season with 37 solo tackles in 12 games, averaging 3.1 tackles per game and finishing 14th on the team in the category. Though those numbers are hardly noteworthy — Eric Kendricks of UCLA led the nation last year with 101 solo tackles — Woods’ impact on the field goes far beyond his individual stats.
Though he may not have had outstanding numbers, his power lies in making those around him better. As nose tackle in a base 3-4 defense, his strength demands constant double-teams against opposing interior offensive linemen, oftentimes shutting down the A-gap on rushes and allowing pass rushers from the defensive tackle and linebacker position to get favorable one-on-one matchups.
His efforts resulted in USC nearly shutting out Arkansas State in the Trojans’ season debut last weekend, holding the opposition to six points. His pressure up the middle hurried Red Wolves quarterback Fredi Knighten constantly, causing errant throws and holding the dual-threat quarterback to just 86 passing yards.
It is his selflessness and determination that are invaluable to the Trojans’ defense — qualities that made him a popular candidate when voting took place at the beginning of the season.
“It’s like a dream come true,” Woods said of being named captain. “Growing up in L.A., I never imagined being named captain of the USC football team. I feel like I made my way into history.”
Woods grew up in Baldwin Village, a low-income area of Los Angeles he refers to as “The Jungles.”  Raised by his father and his grandmother, Woods was bussed to Taft High School in Woodland Hills, California, where his dad played football as an offensive lineman — a 45-minute commute on a good day.
Though he made his name dominating offenses 25 miles away from home, he never lost his love for USC. Currently, fans and opponents are treated to the sight of Woods’ tattoo — a football that covers the inside of his massive bicep that is inscribed with the ’SC logo and the number 99.
“I’ve been watching USC football my whole life,” Woods said. “It’s something I got on me to represent. I bleed cardinal and gold.”
USC may have been his dream school, but his start at the university was almost a nightmare. Relying mostly on raw ability and size in high school, Woods found it difficult to navigate the USC practice field at a whopping 335 pounds when he first arrived on campus, forcing him to redshirt his freshman year.
Instead of sulking, Woods took the time to assess where he wanted to be in the Trojan tradition — a story of unfulfilled potential or working toward joining Mike Patterson and Sedrick Ellis as one the best defensive tackles to play at USC.
Eventually, Woods dropped to a more nimble 295 pounds and earned a spot on the defensive tackle rotation, at which point he never looked back.
Woods is now in his final year with Trojans — a year in which USC is without sanctions and ranked No. 8 in the AP Poll.  He knows that his leadership on defense will be needed for the Trojans to be successful.
“I need to show the young guys how to behave and perform,” Woods said about his duties to the team. “I need to do whatever I can to make the team better.”
With the air around campus a little more electric this year, and with the high expectations that are heaped on this team, Woods had a message to send to the Trojan faithful as they prepare to face the Idaho Vandals on Saturday.
“Show up to the Coliseum with energy,” Woods said. “Get ready to rock it. Fight on.”
Look, USC is just like anywhere else in Los Angeles. The only time people on the USC campus will recognize or even go up to a football player is if he’s a star quarterback, wide receiver, or running back. The only humans on the USC campus that would appreciate what Antwuan Woods is doing on the field, is his teammates, the defensive coordinator, the inside linebackers that he is protecting almost every down, and his position coach. Los Angeles people DO NOT CARE about defensive tackles. But this was a good article though and Daniel Tran, I applaud you for writing a story about a defensive tackle. Not too many writers in Los Angeles County would care let alone write a full page story on an unsung defensive tackle.
Good man….

It was the longest day in Trojan history. An 8 p.m. start time left plenty of time, almost too much, for tailgating. My roommates and I started at 9 a.m., and it wasn’t until about 11:30 p.m. that I left the Coliseum with the band’s celebratory rendition of “Tusk” echoing behind me. There weren’t too many left in the stands at that point, but there wasn’t much of Arkansas State left either after the Trojans’ 55-6 dismantling.
It was reminiscent of last year’s 52-13 win over Fresno State to start the season. I think the 50-point mark is a good barometer for whether or not things clicked as well as they should have. It’s hard to believe that two years ago, this same program lost 10-7 in its home opener to Washington State.
Predicting anything about a team after only one week is crazy. That’d be like deciding what fraternity to join after rushing it for only one week. But our Trojans did everything to validate their No. 8 ranking in the AP Poll, so here’s a list of eight takeaways from the limited sample size. Four are positive, and four are uncertainties that need to be addressed if the Trojans want to jump four spots in the national polls and into the College Football Playoff.
1. The offseason talk is officially off. Like last year, the Trojans showed no signs of distraction from the off-field drama that us sportswriters talked about so much while there weren’t any games to cover — I’m so happy football’s back. Those issues won’t come up again until after the season. Unless things start going wrong …
2. Cupcakes are healthy. I didn’t know Arkansas State’s conference until googling it just now — Sun Belt. It wasn’t until probably the second SoCal Spell-Out that I figured out what its mascot was—“Is it ‘Beat the Rebels’? Oh OK, ‘Red Wolves.’” Of course, it wasn’t as exciting as the 2016 season opener against Alabama will be. But USC already has a wicked tough schedule, so I think a pair of softies to start it off is definitely a good thing.  Idaho is also from the Sun Belt, and its mascot is the Vandal, by the way.
3. Ronald Jones II and Tre Madden. The former is worthy of being ranked by ESPN as the No. 1 running back recruit in the 2015 signing class. The latter is healthy, and dangerous. Technically these are two takeaways, but they belong together. Expect to hear the term “Thunder and Lightning” in some upcoming columns.
4. Clay Helton is — still —a competent playcaller. We already knew this from the times he retook the reins of the offense from a former coordinator turned head coach by the name of Lane Kiffin. You don’t need a degree from Marshall to understand that delegation is a pretty basic and logical executive management strategy. But seven different players with offensive touchdowns was a nice touch in case anyone wasn’t sold.
5. Cody Kessler is a long way from the Heisman. In fact, he might not be the best quarterback in the Pac-12 South, let alone the country, given Josh “Chosen” Rosen’s breakout performance in UCLA’s 34-16 win over Virginia. And that’s OK. He doesn’t need to be the best in the country for USC to seriously look like the best team in the country. He does need to connect on more of his deep balls, though. And he can’t get sacked five times a game. Again, sample size. But my goodness, we better be able to keep up with UCLA …
6.  Bending but not breaking. The Trojans gave up over 400 yards, which isn’t great. But six points allowed is great, as are four recorded turnovers. Arkansas State did spend about an extra 10 minutes of the game in possession, partly because of how quickly USC scored, and the Red Wolves were only marginally more efficient on third downs — 6-19 instead of 3-10. This is neither really here nor there. But here’s to hoping the defense can look even more dominant against better offenses.
7. Adoree’ Jackson needs to be healthy. I almost hope he doesn’t play against Idaho so that nothing else bad happens.
8. The Pac-12 looks bad. Arizona State and Stanford’s upset losses to the SEC’s Texas A&M and the Big Ten’s Northwestern, respectively,  will not help USC’s case for a top four spot at the end of the season. Neither will Washington’s loss to Boise State. Again, this isn’t necessarily a bad thing.  If none of them pose a threat in USC’s first three conference games and the Trojans head into South Bend undefeated on Week six, the Trojans will be in prime position to win the conference. But that could also mean a two-loss, conference-winning Trojan team could be legitimately left out of the CFP.
In conclusion, like I did last year, I’ll reference Lou Holtz’s theory that assessing a team after one game is like predicting the occupation of an infant. Watch Kessler win the Heisman, Helton get demoted and Justin Davis emerge as the dominant back just because I jinxed it.
I’ll again reiterate how happy I am that football is back. We can spend 14 consecutive hours completely consumed in anticipation and viewing of a sports event; it truly is the most wonderful time of the year.
Except next week’s game starts at 5 p.m., and I hope none of my roommates are already up by 6 a.m.
SC did not look crisp. First game or not, a team has to be ready to play and to know its assignments.
Kessler is a good but not a great quarterback. Great ones connect on the long ball.
The defense was spongy.
Overall, SC was not impressive, given the disparity in talent with the Red Wolves.

At Tuesday’s practice, USC coaches were quick to address the offensive line, one of the worrisome aspects of the game against Arkansas State that was otherwise dominated by the Trojans.
“We went back, and we re-emphasized everyone doing his job,” said Bob Connelly, offensive line coach, after practice. “We know what we’re doing. We know our assignments. Today, we talked about going out there and executing your job.”
Overall, the line gave up five sacks, but also dominantly blocked runs, allowing for big holes for Tre Madden, who ran for 106 yards, and the three freshmen running backs. Connelly, however, was not satisfied with the performance.
“It wasn’t good enough,” Connelly said. “I liked the effort. I liked the attitude that we played with, but the assignment football was not good enough, and we did not do a good enough job at protecting the passing unit as an offense.”
Last season’s big concern, starting three freshmen on the offensive line, was supposed to become a strength for the team in Connelly’s first season at USC. Since the freshmen — now sophomores Toa Lobendahn, Viane Talamaivao and Damien Mama — showed flashes of excellence their first year, they are projected to be truly dominant this year. The offensive line, led by Max Tuerk, a preseason         All-American, should also benefit from the added stability of Chad Wheeler, who missed most of last season with a torn ACL, at left tackle.
“No matter how hard they practice all through fall camp, it is impossible to simulate true game speed and game physicality,” said George Tew, assistant offensive line coach for USC last season. “This is true across all levels. So, no matter how much this unit played together last season, it’s been a good eight months since they’ve played against full-go, game-speed opponents, and it’s going to take a few games of getting hit in the mouth to get back up to that speed.”
The Trojans’ offense converted only three of 10 third downs, and the line seemed confused by Arkansas State’s stunts and twists for most of the first half. Arkansas State proved to be a good test for the Trojans. Even though their front seven were physically overmatched, they accounted for it by bringing heavy pressure and blitzing from all over the field, with a large amount of success.
“The only way in this game that you get better is by playing,” said head coach Steve Sarkisian after the game Saturday. “You have to make mistakes and realize what the coach has been talking about. Surely we got better on the front because guys got experience, and it will make us a better team in the long haul.”
Ten offensive linemen, nine defensive linemen and 10 linebackers played in the opener, according to Sarkisian. The offensive line was able to use a game against an unranked opponent to gel as a unit and become more adept at picking up blitzes without putting the win in jeopardy. Connelly will need to use Saturday’s game and next week’s against Idaho to get his line where it needs to be once conference play begins.
“The biggest thing is just settling down,” Connelly said. “Again, there are young guys. There are some true freshmen that were in there playing for the first time in the Coliseum in front of 85,000 people. It’s a learning experience.”
If the offensive line can get to the level where they are protecting Kessler as well as busting open holes for Madden and the backs, then there might not be anything else holding the Trojans back from really taking off this season.
In other practice news, Adoree’ Jackson, who left last week’s game because of a strained abdominal muscle, showcased his usual quickness and athleticism. He participated in everything except team drills — including scout-team work, one-on-ones and punt returning — and is expected to play against Idaho this Saturday. Additionally, tailback Justin Davis practiced fully for the first time since suffering a rib injury Aug. 19 and is also on course to make his 2015 debut Saturday.

Senior outside hitter Samantha Bricio was named the Pac-12 Offensive Player of the Week for the second consecutive week. She started off the season with the nomination and received it once again. This is the fifth time that Bricio has been awarded the honor.
This past weekend, Bricio and the Women of Troy played at the 2015 UNI Tournament in Cedar Falls, Iowa. Bricio was named the tournament MVP. This was the seventh time she received such an honor and the 12th time she was named to an all-tournament team.
In her three matches at the tournament, Bricio surpassed the 1,000 career-dig mark and the 1,500 career-kill mark, making her only the sixth Woman of Troy to reach such a feat. She also collected her third double-double of the season and 44th of her career. She recorded three service aces in a match for the 29th time in her career.
As a team, the No. 6 Women of Troy (6-0) jumped up two spots in the rankings after the tournament victory this past weekend. This is the 15th time in USC history that the team has started the season 6-0 and the ninth time under head coach Mick Haley. The Women of Troy are on a 17-straight-set win streak.
For the conference as a whole, the Pac-12 has been having a dominant start to the 2015 volleyball season. To start off this season’s play, Pac-12 teams went 27-7 with 17 three-set sweeps.
In recognition of their dominant play, eight teams are ranked in the Top 25 of the AVCA Coaches Poll with four being in the top 10: No. 3 Stanford, No. 6 USC, No. 8 Washington, No. 10 Arizona State, No. 12 Oregon,   No. 13 Arizona, No. 17 UCLA and No. 23 Colorado.
Four of the conference teams are still undefeated to open the season — Arizona, Arizona State, USC, Washington — and 10 teams have a record of .500 or better.  Pac-12 teams have defeated seven ranked non-conference teams so far with USC leading the pack with three of those wins.
Pac-12 teams can credit their success to the strength of their defense. Nine teams have kept their opponents to a .178 or worse hitting percentage. Arizona State is leading the charge by keeping their opponents to a .076 hitting average.
The Conference of Champions is living up to their name in women’s volleyball. In the NCAA Tournament last season, the   Pac-12 saw an unprecedented 10 teams receive bids and open up postseason play 10-0. The          Pac-12 is grabbing a lot of attention in women’s volleyball. The conference once again has the most television coverage of any conference in the country with 95 matches broadcast live.
The conference also dominates in recruiting. Seven teams landed at least one Volleyball Magazine FAB 50 player. Oregon led the conference with four recruits and Stanford signed the nation’s top recruit opposite Hayley Hodson, who has already made an immediate impact with the Cardinal.

Grammar, stylistic conventions and the more technical aspects of writing get a bad rap. We all know they’re necessary, but surely it’s the content that makes the writing, right? Besides, breaking the rules from time to time is how creative writing stays fresh.
But this is the wrong way to look at it. The rules of writing aren’t rigid, and a good writer can bend and interpret them without breaking them to make a statement or perfect their tone.
In journalism, consistent conventions create flow for readers between articles that might have been written by writers with wildly different styles — nobody wants to shift gears every 800 words just to get their news. Even more importantly, though, is how a set of stylistic rules can make a statement and clarify a position.
The difference in connotation between “homosexual” and “LGBT” or “black” and “African-American” can speak to what a writer is trying to say, or what position a publication is assuming on a controversial topic. Even for less sensitive issues, matters as seemingly trivial as capitalization are worth analyzing for the statement they make; it’s why we discussed for the better part of an hour whether we would use “University” or “university” when referring to USC.
No matter the medium, the rules that guide writing should be seen as stimulating, not stifling. Without these rules there would be no point of reference with which to distinguish professional, creative, interesting, clever or just plain bad writing. They offer an ever-shifting set of boundaries with which to perfectly frame what you are trying to say — nuances like the order of words in a list, where a paragraph breaks and how long you let a sentence run are all opportunities for a good writer to emphasize, connotate and elaborate.
Because of the ever-changing nature of diction and writing, the staff of the Daily Trojan will always have to meet about the details of our publication’s style. And these meetings will alway make me want to slam my head against my desk as we enter hour three of the debate over “historic” vs “historical.” But, to effectively convey the niceties of a topic and write with genuine complexity, it sometimes pays to give a f*** about an Oxford comma.
Burke Gibson is a senior majoring in economics. He is also the associate managing editor of the Daily Trojan.

It’s hard to imagine industrial systems engineering major and singer-songwriter Leo Xia ever feeling like an outsider. He’s a conscientious conversationalist who smiles easily, listens closely and appears to be friends with everyone. Xia’s lyrics, however, speak to a sense of alienation, which he says comes from his background as an Asian American who was born in the U.S. but grew up as an expatriate in Beijing. Though Xia has settled in the Asian-American community at USC, he said he often feels like a “perpetual foreigner.”
Born in Walnut Creek, California, Xia’s father moved his family to China when he took a job in Beijing. As a result, Xia attended the International School of Beijing from first grade until he graduated high school and came to USC. As a freshman, he took first place at the International Student Assembly iVoice Competition 2013, which was judged by YouTube stars Sam Tsui and Kurt Schneider. Since then, Xia went on to win second place at the Asian Pacific American Student Assembly’s Got Talent 2015 and won the Hong Kong Student Assembly U852 External Singing Contest 2015. He also performed at Springfest in 2014 and InspirAsian, hosted by the USC Student Coalition for Asian Pacific Empowerment.
Xia’s musical journey started when he joined a band in middle school. One of his friends was the band’s lead vocalist and convinced Xia to play the keyboard. Soon after, his friend got him to join choir as well. When asked about his first foray into songwriting, however, Xia is reticent, waving it off as a cheesy love song for his first girlfriend.
Xia’s current admirers know him as someone who writes and sings about his Asian-American identity and social justice. Xia said he was inspired by a program of Asian Pacific American Student Services called “Critical Issues in Race, Class and Leadership Education” — a leadership seminar featuring discussions on race, class, gender and other issues — to start writing more about social justice. A recent song of his addresses the intersectionality of being Asian American and LGBT. Xia is a straight cisgender male, so the song is about the importance of being an ally.
“It’s hard to be [a part of the LGBT community], but it’s even harder to be Asian LGBT because you know how conservative Asian parents are,” Xia said. “That can often create a lot of friction with the family. People get thrown out of their homes.”
Xia has graduated from romantic love songs to songs about other kinds of love. He said his influences coming from many areas of his life.
“My more recent stuff has been less writing about relationship love; it’s been more like, love for friends, love for family, love for social justice, love for my own identity, love for myself,” Xia said. “Self-love is very important. I care a lot about that.”
The romantic parts of Xia’s style are still apparent as he crooned to his audience at the 626 Night Market in Arcadia, California on Sept. 4. This was Xia’s second performance at the 626 Night Market this year, where he got to stand on the same stage as his favorite YouTube artists. Initially, a friend told him to sign up in the summer, when he first performed a set that he described as “calculated to impress.” This time, Xia performed mostly new material.
“[The purpose was to] play an honest set,” Xia said. “A set where people will walk away feeling like they got to know me, and my values, how I see the world and my experiences.”
Each song had personal meaning to Xia, and regardless of the reception he gets, he is happy to share a piece of himself.
Xia started out with a rendition of “Omen” by Disclosure ft. Sam Smith then launched into his first original song of the night, “Artist.” Guitar in hand, mirroring the style of his idol Jason Mraz, Xia performed in a style that felt intimate and emotional.
“I’m a vulnerable person, especially because as a singer-songwriter, I put my feelings out there when I perform my own songs,” Xia said. “I feel very lucky that there’s a specific stage for people that look like me. There’s a lot pressure and pride that comes with representing the Asian-American experience in the incredibly established Asian-American community at USC. I’m standing on the shoulders of giants.”
For his third song, he sang an old favorite, “Split Down the Middle,” an original song about being Asian-American. The song is full of shout-outs to famous Asians, such as Jeremy Lin. The vehemence behind the chorus “I don’t give a sh*t / What your passport is” is indicative of an anger that people have been tempted to give into, especially younger people of Xia’s background.
“There’s very few people that are super comfortable [with their identity],” Xia said. “All Asians are at a different place along the spectrum of being comfortable in their Asian-American-ness. You have to learn things but teach your parents at the same time.”
Xia ended his set with a cover of “Brother” by Matt Corby and a final original song, “Crystal Clear.”
Though almost at the end of his USC career, Xia is still experimenting with his passion in music. He is as unsure about his future as any other college student might be, and is struggling with the choice between a more traditionally stable career in engineering or a riskier one in music. For now, Xia said he will keep exploring music.
“I want to create a space in the moment of my music where no one feels marginalized,” Xia said.

Anticipation for Avicii’s new album has been rising among EDM lovers as its Oct. 2 release date quickly approaches. Since the Swedish DJ’s first album, True, had its debut at No. 5 on the charts in 2013, Tim Bergling — under the stage name Avicii — has spent the last two years touring and generating excitement among fans for his new album, Stories.
True was an album that in many ways shocked the music world. EDM was just starting to become more popular upon the release of Avicii’s single, “Levels.” Many fans had mixed reviews for True upon its initial release, as many of its songs strayed from typical electronic music. However, the album did extremely well universally and had many hits, including “Hey Brother,” “Wake Me Up” and “Addicted to You.” In many ways, Avicii’s decision to create a unique album such as True was a great decision, as it attracted many people who do not typically listen to EDM. The album consists of songs that touch on a variety of genres, from electro-infused house music to folk music.
Though True was undoubtedly a success, Bergling has decided to take a different approach to the upcoming album.  The sophomore album will stay true to his EDM roots with a bit of a twist from his previous songs. As he said in a Rolling Stone interview, Stories is expected to be “a lot more song-oriented” than his last album, which is surprising to the many  who considered his first album very song-oriented already. Bergling said he attempted to reach this vision in True, he feels that his goal of “getting electronic music in a song format” will be more successful in Stories. In order to achieve his goal of creating electronic yet meaningful songs, he has collaborated with several hit musicians from Bon Jovi to Chris Martin. Bergling is sure to have several chart-toppers.
If his collaborations aren’t enough to get the album some attention, the recent singles from it definitely will be. “Waiting for Love” was released early this summer and absolutely lives up to the EDM and lyrical blend that Bergling is going for. The song is the collaboration between Avicii and Martin Garrix, a 19-year-old Dutch DJ, and is perfectly paired with the vocals of John Legend. Especially after performing the song together at Ultra Music Festival, Garrix and Avicii’s song made for a perfect summer hit. Having created 70 songs for the album, the 14 songs he chose for Stories are sure to meet expectations.
Two other songs have been released from the album, titled “For A Better Day” and “Pure Grinding.”  The two were released just days ago as a two-track extended play, “Pure Grinding / For A Better Day,” and unquestionably support the fact that this album will not be a repeat of his last one. Avicii said that he “had a lot more freedom to explore new sounds on Stories,” and you can hear it by listening to “Pure Grinding” for the first time. Though his beats are deeply resonate, the song has a jazzy undertone that makes the song very unique from his previous releases. The slow start in “For A Better Day” uses piano to create a more lyric-focused song but maintains an electronic rhythm that comes in the chorus.
Different doesn’t necessarily mean better, but in Avicii’s case, Stories seems to be on the right track to getting the attention he hopes to receive. For those looking to see some of his new hits live any time soon, the only place to go is Las Vegas, where he has four set concert dates between now and October. Avicii has yet to release tour dates for 2016, but a world tour seems like it could be on the horizon.
After having to cancel his tour last year due to health concerns, fans are even more excited to see him live. Though the tour’s abandonment was disappointing  for all who planned to go, it just gave Bergling even more time to spend on this highly anticipated second album.

You slowly see your friends trickle in over the course of the week as you take your time with unpacking and purchasing items for your new abode. The posters and room decorations seem to burgeon like flowers upon the walls just as you yourself seem to flourish as an independent individual capable of buying your own toilet paper, instant noodles and soap. No longer will you have to brave the mysteries of the public showers or struggle to cook a midnight meal with no more than a microwave. You have made it out of the dorms and into an apartment.
As it’s my first time living in an apartment style space, I have quickly learned two all-too-real realities of living in an apartment: nobody feeds you and nobody cleans your toilet for you.

To remedy the problem of no food, or rather no meals, one can either be proactive or reactive. You can, like one of my roommates, prepare pre-mixed batter for waffles and cook elaborate meals for you and your friends — taking full advantage of the stove and oven. Or, like one of my other roommates, enjoy a simple sandwich and free food on campus, taking full advantage of all the food opportunities outside our actual kitchen. I have chosen to be a hybrid of my roommates, often attending events on campus for the free meal while still fixing a simple salad or fried rice when said events aren’t taking place. My kitchen skills are limited but my parents won’t have to worry about me starving.
There’s really no other way to contain inevitable messiness other than vigilantly cleaning everything yourself. Like the police to a crime scene, you have to be on that spill or stain as soon as the incident occurs. Ready your Bounty paper towels and Mr. Clean sponges, they will be your partners in crime against the dangers of stove massacres and dish pile-ups. Making your bed isn’t always necessary, but when you only brought one cup and one plate to college, your dishes will determine whether you get to eat or drink immediately.

These startling realties of apartment living have, however, quickly become routine. Once you move on from the terror of stoves and toilets, the joys of independence will overshadow the grueling labor of basic household tasks. Food will be in fridge, so long as you buy it, and toilets work, so long as you maintain them. (And if not, put in a work order immediately to avoid waiting a very long week to get a new toilet — I know from experience.)
Happy apartment living!

With a huge mural of great fighters such as Mike Tyson and Muhammad Ali, City of Angels Boxing is hard to miss. New to the USC area, but not to boxing, City of Angels opened a location in downtown L.A. just a few months ago. Just blocks from campus, it’s no wonder the gym has become a favorite of USC students — one look inside, and you’ll catch a sea of cardinal and gold USC shirts in the class and USC tags decorating the gym’s walls. Students aren’t the only ones to take note of the gym; City of Angels has developed quite the celebrity clientele. Actors, actresses and models have frequented the classes, and in its off hours, the location has become a set for photoshoots and music videos.
With the new semester starting and its attendance shooting through the roof, City of Angels has recently started a new schedule. The gym offers boxing classes Monday through Friday at noon, 6, 7 and 8 p.m., and Saturday at 10 a.m. and noon. It also just added a 6:30 a.m. class on Wednesdays during September.
The first class for new customers is free — including free wraps and gloves, which City of Angels usually rents for $1 and $3, respectively. Each class after is $20, with the gym offering a 10-class package for $150, and a monthly unlimited membership for $99 per month.
The gym is owned and run by Alex Brenes, also known as “The Costa Rican Warrior” or “The Freakin’ Costa Rican.” Brenes started teaching boxing 14 years ago in Florida, eventually developing a client list and starting his own gym, which went through several moves between Miami and the club’s current location on Hill Street. One step into the gym’s office, and it’s clear who runs the show — though it’s hard to miss Alex and his loud personality, it’s his wife Jesse who runs most of the gym’s day-to-day operations.
My first time at the gym I was nervous, to say the least. Though I sometimes boast of my “athletic potential,” I was worried I’d end up embarrassing myself with my lack of strength and noodle-like limbs. Either Jesse and Alex have gotten pretty good at identifying newbies or I wasn’t doing a very good job of hiding my anxiety because Jesse immediately called me out, asking if it was my first time. However, Jesse’s warm personality and welcome immediately put my fears to rest as she handed me the waiver and set me up with some wraps and gloves.
Each class at City of Angels is mixed with new faces, beginners and experienced boxers, with instructors adjusting the workout to account for different experience levels. The gym rotates through three instructors — Alex, Dawn and Zac — but Alex teaches the majority of the boxing classes.
I set my gloves down under a bag and prepared myself the best I could for Alex’s class, something that quickly became the most intense workout of my life. The hour-long class was pretty manageable at first: Alex begins every class with five to 10 minutes of stretching and warm-up exercises. Next, shadowboxing took a while for me to master. Alex took this time to go around the class, explaining the proper stance to newbies and helping other students perfect their form. He really emphasized the concepts of the power of punches coming from your core and moving your entire body with each punch. Simply punching with your hands or arms will cause you to tire quickly, but with the combination of a strong stance and twisting your whole body, you’ll be able to move faster and fight longer.
The high-intensity workout really started with the conditioning part of the class, during which students complete intervals on the bag, straight punches or combinations, and cardio exercises. On any given day, students can expect a combination of squats, jump squats, lunges, mountain climbing, pushups, planks or anything else Alex can think of. Sometimes, this would even incorporate weights, medicine balls or resistance bands. Each four-minute interval felt like an eternity, and water breaks like small slices of heaven.
Though my body wasn’t used to the exercise, I was so pumped up by the music and Alex’s jokes — Donald Trump is a common theme — that I pushed myself, trying to keep up with the class’ regulars. I was burned out enough from my first class that after the first 40 minutes I took advantage of the four-minute jump rope cool-down to take a seat and rest. The last five to 10 minutes of class concluded with ab exercises on the floor — by no means easy, but a welcome rest for my spaghetti limbs.
Alex wasn’t lying when he said I’d feel the burn, and as he says, boxing really is a total body workout. Like almost every student in the class (even the biggest, buffest guys and most experienced boxers), I left the gym dripping in sweat. Almost every part of my body was sore for five days after my first class; I worked muscles I didn’t even know I had, but I liked it. The class was absolutely brutal, but a total blast and a welcome departure from my usual workout. Though by no means did I feel ready for the ring after one class, learning how to properly perform jabs, hooks, uppercuts and combinations makes you train and feel like a real fighter without getting beat up like one. City of Angels stays true to their slogan: “Get fit, not hit.”

Laziness will be the death of you. As a theatre student, I may be overdramatizing, but I believe some of the greatest qualities a person can display are motivation and persistence. These qualities are unparalleled when compared to the intelligent, yet lazy lifestyle that seems to permeate college culture.
According to a study from The New Yorker, 65 percent of students claimed they did not want to procrastinate because they were aware the delay alone would make them unhappy.
This delay that creates unhappy students is caused by a number of distracting applications. For example, there are plenty of us that would rather enjoy the drama and hilarity of “Orange is the New Black” or “Parks and Recreation” than conquer that reading of “Conquistador and the Fall of Old Mexico” for your History GE.
Therefore, this is my call to action: look deeper into your Trojan moral values. Fight on!
Fight past your Netflix-bingeing, and start to take action. At times, we all procrastinate and do not follow through with seemingly easy tasks. However, in these moments, let us recall the Trojan spirit. If your Trojan spirit needs a little armed assistance while dueling the calculus homework that lies in front of you, it is time for you to turn to other platforms.
Here are some pieces to follow:
Nike’s “Just Do It” is perhaps one of the most empowering yet simple messages; the most challenging aspect to procrastination is starting. In order to start, just count to 10 and begin the task. Too much planning can lead to not enough doing.
This tip is best used for the most dreadful of classes, as rewarding yourself will help fight the procrastination. Whether it be your favorite food or 15 minutes of sleep, planning a little reward for yourself can be the motivation you need to get down to work.
Get the Self Control application. This computer app is designed to block distracting sites for a set amount of time. It will eliminate any dangerous temptation that might lead you to the worlds of Facebook, Twitter, or the ever-useless Vine.
Complete the tasks that you know you are capable of getting done. Once you have one task or two simple tasks done, you are more inclined to fight past the rest.
Be aware of your set goals and look to them in these moments of procrastination. Whether it is working on your new hot bod at the gym or preparing for a final in neuroscience, having goals and aspirations will aid you more than you know.

Students on college campuses around the nation and here at USC are asking for trigger warnings and trying to reduce microaggressions from faculty members and fellow students. Recently, this has stirred up backlash among opponents of “political correctness” and self-described intellectual freedom activists. Most notably, in this month’s issue of The Atlantic, Greg Lukianoff and Jonathan Haidt contort this phenomenon into an objective threat to psychological development, all the while conflating the idea of trigger warnings with the most extreme cases of censorship.
In order to discuss the topic further, it is critical to first understand what exactly trigger warnings and microaggressions are. A trigger warning, in the context of higher education, is a statement issued by a professor disclosing to students that a certain reading or assignment may be considered a trigger to someone suffering from psychological trauma. For example, a student coping with the trauma of a sexual assault, something experienced by one in four women on college campuses, may wish to be warned that reading material graphically depicts an instance of sexual assault. Coined by Columbia University professor Derald Sue, the term “microaggressions” is defined as as “brief and commonplace daily verbal, behavioral or environmental indignities, whether intentional or unintentional, that communicate hostile, derogatory, or negative racial slights and insults toward people of color.” This includes something such as saying a girl is “pretty for a black girl” or complimenting an Asian-American born and raised in the United States on their “good English.”
In his own response to The Atlantic’s incendiary cover story, Aaron Hanlon, an assistant professor at Colby College, pointed out that, “The thinking behind the idea that trigger warnings are a form of censorship is fundamentally illogical: those who offer warnings, at our professional discretion, about potentially triggering material are doing so precisely because we’re about to teach it!”
Hanlon iterates that such warnings are not the end of a difficult conversation, but usually the beginning of one. Students who struggle with sensitive material then feel more comfortable discussing this with a professor during office hours.
The question is, then, what is at stake for those who so desperately want to defend their right to offensive or triggering speech — those who argue that America is a free country and they have a right to be insensitive to the plight of others if they desire to. In a hyper-masculine patriarchal society, this makes sense and is also usually defended by the idea of the “real world” — the trite “that’s not how it works in the real world.” They may also argue that institutions of higher education should encourage students to challenge their own ideas and beliefs. But entrenched negative attitudes toward minorities evidenced by microaggressions are not challenging or interesting intellectual ideas; they are banal relics of an ugly past. Not to mention, a student who already suffers trauma from a sexual assault or racial violence needs no reminder that these terrible realities do, in fact, exist in the “real world.”
The resistance to removing microaggressions also illustrates that mental health is still not considered as essential to a student’s well-being as physical health and safety. When USC students graduate and enter the “real world,” they probably won’t have a whole force of security personnel hired by their university to protect them from any of the realities that face residents of south central Los Angeles. However, USC’s provision of such public safety measures is not considered “coddling.” Getting through curriculum without psychological trauma should be as integral to a quality college experience as being able to walk home safely at night.
Hanlon pointed out that “students remain more vulnerable to institutional power than the professors who assign their grades or the administrators who adjudicate their missteps.” It is worth considering whether blithe microaggressions and disregarding psychological triggers as trivial and inconvenient are aspects of the higher education experience worth preserving in order to prepare students for the “real world,” or whether we should try to do better by our future generations — starting now.

Coping with discomfort – being comfortable with discomfort – is the cornerstone of mental health. Relying on intellectual bubble wrap is precisely the wrong way to foster this.
Microagression and  trigger warning issues will only contribute to the lack of emotional development of our younger generation by coddling them, by pretending these concepts protect them. Get over it. Life outside of the college campus is far more real than within the inner sanctum of the campus.  The only person who hurts your feelings is you. You, and you alone, are responsible for how you react to others.

In an effort to reach lower-income communities, the California Air Resources Board voted last month to amend the Clean Vehicle Rebate Program to limit electric vehicle rebates to middle-class households. The vote addresses an unexpected development that the program created: It was notorious for handing out rebates to households that make over $500,000 annually. However, this new limitation is not enough to secure California’s policy goals. The rebate program must be reworked to ensure that Californians are purchasing as many clean vehicles as possible.
Under this program, rebates vary by car model and electric type — a plug-in Toyota Prius rebate is $1,500, while a Toyota Mirai is $5,000. They are, however, consistent based on the electric category. Though the majority of subsidies did not go to wealthy Californians, what is concerning is that purchases of Teslas, luxury electric cars, are responsible for about 16 percent of all rebate funding — approximately $42 million. The cheapest Tesla vehicle currently available is the Tesla Model S, which costs approximately $75,000. This is far out of reach for most Californians, whose median annual household income is $61,000, according to the U.S. Census Bureau. This means rebates often go to families that do not need them — and, therefore, are not as effective as they could be.
If California wants to put more electric cars on the road, then it must make electric cars affordable for most residents and provide effective incentives for Californians to purchase them. According to the program’s website, only 6 percent of the rebates have gone to buyers in “disadvantaged communities.” More must be done to change this. The $42 million used to subsidize luxury car purchases for many who could already afford such a vehicle laughs in the face of the program’s purpose: to increase accessibility to electric cars.
The money used to subsidize Tesla purchases could have been diverted to make other electric cars cheaper for more Californians. The Nissan Leaf, for example, retails for $29,000, less than half of the value of the Tesla Model S. The $42 million paid to Tesla buyers could have put more than 1,000 Nissans on the road at no extra cost to the purchaser. Considering the already-low price of the Leaf, rebates for that car specifically could reach far more buyers than rebates across the board. Creating incentives for already low-priced electric vehicles puts them within reach of even Californians who make half of the median income.
It is perfectly acceptable to subsidize cars across the board for all potential buyers if the intent were simply to make all electric cars more affordable regardless of the socioeconomic status of the purchaser. However, if the qualifying and determining characteristic of the program’s success is how many electric cars are actually purchased, then rebates must aim for the lowest common denominator. Doing so increases the number of purchases of electric vehicles, which then decreases overall carbon emissions.
The political establishment, however, does not share this view. It only recently voted to disqualify households that make $500,000 or more from subsidies for battery-operated cars, the most common electric vehicle. Despite the vote, these households can still get rebates over three times the value of those for plug-in hybrids if they purchase comparatively uncommon hydrogen fuel cell cars.
Even the most expensive gasoline-driven cars will constitute less than half of a very wealthy Californian’s income. In contrast, even with incentives, most Californians would have to pay half of their annual income for even the cheapest all-electric vehicles. The most expedient way to reduce this inequality in purchasing power is to give more rebates to Californians who could not otherwise purchase electric vehicles.
Keeping this in mind, it is clear that the government ought to emphasize subsidization in the middle class. The current system does not cater to the needs of most Californians or effectively pursue California’s policy goals. As it stands, the rebate program still heavily supports wealthy Californians at the expense of most Californians. If California wants to have more — and not simply more expensive — electric cars on the road, then the rebate system needs to be reworked and re-forged with the express purpose of putting more clean cars in the hands of more Californians.
The rebate program was created to increase the number of electric cars used in California. In this mission the program has been successful. The same rebates were available for new owners of all models of electric vehicle. Rebates claimed by Tesla owners have not yet discouraged buyers of less costly vehicles. With electric vehicle technology now proven, it is perhaps time to revise the program for higher adoption among those seeking a lower priced model.

The social media app, Vine, has become one of the most popular and versatile platforms of social media. Since its inception in 2013, Vine is now one of the most lucrative avenues for artists and musicians to break out into the industry. Viral cute boy duo, Jack and Jack, along with now super-star Shawn Mendes made their musical debuts on Vine just a little over a year ago.
Now, more than two years into its production, Vine has added a brand new feature to expand the experience for the musical viners. Music discovery and music editing tools are new features that allow viners to make their social internet world more pragmatic for production and self-marketing. These exciting new additions will create a more diverse media platform, but do present several issues for the company as a whole. 
The “discovery” part of the app allows viners to view which songs are featured in certain loops. I know I have experienced problems with this many times on Vine, wishing I knew what song was used. Instead of having to search deep into the black hole of commentary by everyone who has ever seen that video, users can now click a small icon on the top of the screen in order to see the name and artist of the song used in the clip.
iPhone users also get a new “Snap to Beat” that matches beats for better audio loops. Ever wondered how Rudy Mancuso can loop his funky instrumentals so well? This new beat feature allows regular users to loop some of their favorite songs into their personal vines.
As great as some of these features are, both for the regular users and artists, they could cause some potential issues down the road. For now, these features are free, but it remains to be seen if they will stay that way. If the music features prove lucrative for the company, there may be an opening for significant financial gain. This could mean that users would have to be charged for the use of these features.
Another issue that could arise is between Vine and the artists whose music is being used. If Vine does decide to charge for the features, royalties would have to be split between the company, artist and music label.
For now, these new music features present an exciting opportunity for artists hoping to upload their music on Vine. Media platforms like Vine have given remarkable opportunities to artists and experimenters alike in the music industry. Hopefully, with these new features, Vine is breaking ground for a more innovative music-media culture in the future.

Beauty Behind the Madness, the highly anticipated album by Canadian singer The Weeknd (also known as Abel Tesfaye) hit shelves last week, with Nielsen Music reporting an estimated 412,000 album sales. This was The Weeknd’s second studio release, following his critically acclaimed but less commercially successful albums, Kiss Land and Trilogy, a compilation of three mix tapes recorded between 2011 and 2012 that garnered heavy media attention.
Those familiar with The Weeknd’s past releases might find it surprising that the dark/alt R&B style that characterizes the Trilogy and much of Kiss Land was less evident in this latest album. In its hit singles such as “Can’t Feel My Face” in the lead-up to the album release, he introduces a more pop-oriented sound.
Though Beauty Behind the Madness leaves behind Trilogy producer Doc McKinney, who influenced his earlier sound, it brings back long-time collaborator and producer Illangelo. It also joins The Weeknd with Max Martin, the Swedish hit-maker behind top records by Taylor Swift, Maroon 5 and more. Rumors have it that The Weeknd was several songs deep into an album with Doc McKinney in 2014, fusing his Trilogy sound with Nirvana rock vibes, before Republic Records and the singer agreed to try to make his next release more pop-styled. From that point, successes of songs such as “Earned It,” his feature on Ariana Grande’s “Love Me Harder,” have marked a turn to a different audience, creating buzz around his next album.
Beauty Behind the Madness opens with billowing, distorted arena rock guitars on “Real Life,” setting up the grand entrance for the 14-track album. Similar to the lyrical content of his past work, The Weeknd explores his inability to love and being “destructive” as an ode to his ways of a star, and the implied vices that come with it. After reaching the pinnacle of today’s music stardom at this point in his career, he is not only recognizing the self-destructiveness of his past and present, but also in a sense accepting that it’s a part of the story and path that got him to ‘“real life’” success.
On “Losers,” the beat drop and instrumental component draw the audience in on a hypnotic dance rhythm that hearkens back to The Weeknd’s past as a high school drop-out. The next track, “Tell Your Friends,” marks the first collaboration between The Weeknd and Kanye West, who claims the production credits on this track. It samples Soul Dog’s 1976 song, “Can’t Stop Loving You” for a powerful beat that The Weeknd mixes up with a slightly rapped verse for a dramatic hook. This song features some of The Weeknd’s strongest and most personal verses, yet it isn’t too emotionally heavy, preserving the “jam-out” material that likely Kanye West pushed for, as the song draws inspiration from West’s own “Devil In A New Dress.”
The following tracks, “Often” and “The Hills” were released as singles prior to the album’s release, garnering positive reviews. “Acquainted” is a song based upon a leaked single of a track known as “Girls Born In The 90s” that became the lyrical and chord-progression influence on this song, and shows up in a distorted outro at the end of the song. “Can’t Feel My Face,” the seventh track on the album, was one of the summer’s biggest hits, its catchy baseline and chorus reminiscent of the works of Michael Jackson.
Though some fans might believe the song sacrifices The Weeknd’s true artistic nature and voice, the track is more of an experimentation of a different style, and lyrically has the double entendre of the subject being about a romance or an addiction, recurring themes in The Weeknd’s work. “Shameless” is another strong track lyrically with an echo-filled guitar, where The Weeknd illustrates the shame of unrequited lust. Yet, at the same time, in consistency with his persona devoid of love and emotion, he has no regrets. “Earned It” is the hit ballad from Fifty Shades of Grey that was released as a single earlier in the year. “In The Night” is arguably the best track on the album, immediately on a parallel instrumentally with Michael Jackson’s “The Way You Make Me Feel.”
The album ends with excellent vocal and lyrical performances on “As You Are”, and “Dark Times” with Ed Sheeran and “Prisoner” with Lana del Rey. “Angel” closes out the album, a ballad that reveals the more emotional side of The Weeknd. In the track, he wishes a former lover true love, with supporting vocals added by Maty Noyes.
As a whole, Beauty Behind The Madness is some of The Weeknd’s best work lyrically in terms of individually composed songs. Though as a whole, the album does not have a clear progression or flow, as each individual mixtape on Trilogy and Kiss Land had a cinematic, storyline-like quality to it. This album has several singles that are huge radio hits, but are not necessarily cohesive with each other, which does not take away from the album as a whole, but makes it meant to be experienced in a different perspective, much like the new pop route that The Weeknd is taking with his music.
The Weeknd will be remembered indefinitely for the success of the hits from the album, increasing his visibility heavily for future releases, in addition to a likely Best R&B or Pop album Grammy nomination in February 2016. Though whether he continues to go down the pop route or decides to return to his alternative routes remains to be seen, we can appreciate this artistically mature release by The Weeknd thus far. Beauty Behind The Madness is undoubtedly a commercial success with quality content.

A few days ago in class, our professor asked us about our first impression or memory of London. Immediately, my mind jumped back to the summer of 2012, the last time I was in the UK. I was participating in a summer program at Oxford, and on a free day decided to take a bus and venture into London on my own. Sitting upstairs on one of those classic big red buses, we finally entered London and I was in complete awe of this amazing city. Though I had been to London before with family, I always look back on this memory fondly because it symbolizes the first time I truly felt independent. It was also the first time I felt so connected to a place that, at a 16-year-old, I decided with absolute certainty that one day I wanted to live here.
Since that day, I have developed quite a fondness for exploring places on my own. Whether it be walking along the South Bank, sitting on the tube or reading a book on a bench in Hyde Park, there is nothing that fills me with quite as much joy as wandering around London by myself, with no particular destination.
For example, the other day I decided to take a short walk around our flat (update for those of you who read my last post —  the era of the “mega-bed” has sadly ended, and our room has been restored to normal dorm-style setup). Fifteen minutes into my stroll, I turned a corner and unintentionally found myself at St. Paul’s Cathedral, one of the most beautiful and famous spots in London. Amidst tourists, small children and an insane number of pigeons, I sat quietly on the steps of the cathedral and read my book while watching the beautiful sunset. Though it may seem simple, this evening has probably been one of the highlights of my trip so far. It reminded me of that same jolt of happiness and independence I experienced three years ago riding alone on that big red bus.
I think it is these kinds of outings that can resonate with someone the most while traveling in a new place. However, traveling almost always includes a time limit as well, and therefore the “aimless wandering” I enjoy so much is not something one can always experience.
This is one of the reasons I feel most grateful for having this opportunity to study abroad, rather than just visit. As a student in London for the next four months, I am taking full advantage of the fact that I do have the time and space to be able to really explore the city on my own, without the constant pressure of feeling like I have to see as much as possible in a short amount of time. Even if it is only for a few months, I am glad that I can at least attempt to feel like a true “Londoner” instead of a tourist.
Of course I’m not completely excusing myself from touristic guilty pleasures. In only two weeks of my time here, I have seen Shakespeare’s “As You Like It” at the Globe Theater, danced in the streets of Notting Hill Carnival and explored the beautiful grounds of Hampton Court Palace. Our itinerary for the rest of the semester is jam-packed with events of this sort, but I am certainly glad that in addition to these more typical outings I will also continue having the chance to take that alone time that means so much to me, and get lost in this wonderful city.
After asking us about our first impressions, this same professor stated that the best way to truly enjoy London is to “allow our individual experiences guide our interpretation of the city,” and I plan on doing just that.

“Where’s my class again?”
“KAP?”
“THH?”
“VKC?”
I know that for a lot of my friends and me, Google became our best friend when it came to looking up what the three-letter building code in our schedules.
“USC KAP” we would frantically type into the search engine bar moments before our first class. From there, we would pull out our handy dandy USC map, locate the building name and run out the door.
But rest assured fellow freshmen, there’s a much easier and more convenient solution to this problem: the USC map app. Well-loved, adored and doted upon by all upperclassmen, this nifty tool makes it easy to look cool while frantically searching for Tutor Hall (RTH). Say goodbye to flimsy paper maps and hello to sleek cellphone screens. USC Maps is at your service, 24 hours a day, seven days a week.
Before, you always called your teachers “Mr.____” or “Mrs.____”, but now that you’re in college, things get a lot more complicated. Some of your professors may prefer to be called “Professor____” or “Dr.____,” while others might allow you to refer to them on a first-name basis. Either way, the rule of thumb is that unless you’re referring to your roommate’s parents or some adult unaffiliated with the university, no one really goes by Mr. or Mrs. anymore.
Some of your professors may cover how they’d like to be called in their introductions on the first day of class. Ultimately, if you still aren’t sure, you can also just ask them. Otherwise, referring to them as “Professor ____” is probably your best bet.
It’s no secret that USC has a ton of clubs. But though it means there really is something for everyone, having so many clubs to choose from can be quite overwhelming.
So how do you choose? First of all, do some research. This doesn’t have to be a serious report  — just type the name of a club into Facebook or Google, send them an email with any questions you have or talk to some current members. After you’ve narrowed down your list a little, it’s time to go to some general meetings. Here, you can get a realistic taste of what the club is all about. If you like it, sign up for more information. Groups don’t usually force commitment until later on in the semester, so you can always change your mind if you want. The key is not to not spread yourself too thin and to find clubs that you are really passionate about.
So maybe you came in as a business major, but you’re really into economics. Or maybe you’re an English major hoping to switch into print and digital journalism. Either way, it’s only your freshman year. You have plenty of time to explore your options by taking GEs in areas outside of your major or even other classes in subjects you might be interested in. The best part is that, in the case that you don’t enjoy the class, you can always drop it within the first three weeks with no mark on your transcript. So explore any options you might be interested in. After all, college is about finding what you truly love doing.
5. Never having time to finish anyt

After 18 full days in the beautiful city of London, it is finally starting to feel like home. I can still remember my pre-flight jitters and nervousness — a feeling that I am sure most, if not all, travelers can relate to. The days leading up to my departure were filled with so many conflicting emotions; it was to the point where I began questioning if I even wanted to go ahead with this trip. In an effort to not have too high of expectations, I ended up imagining all the things that could go wrong on this trip which was, to say the least, counterproductive. Regardless of my clear and apparent nerves, I hopped on my nine-hour flight and hoped for the best. I had no idea what to expect, and I’m not afraid to say that the first couple days here in London were a bit rough compared to the majestic welcome that I thought I might have had.
As I’m sitting here writing tips to future travelers and study abroad students, I want to tell you to not be afraid of the unknown like I was. Just let your semester abroad take its course. There will surely be ups and downs, but I promise you it will be one of the best experiences of your life. I can already say the decision to study abroad is in fact one of the best I’ve ever made.
The first couple days were filled with so much culture shock, I thought I would never adjust. Everyone told me how lucky I was to be going to London since it’s an English-speaking country and that I wouldn’t have to deal with another language. However, that does not mean you don’t face any struggles. People drive on the wrong side of the road and don’t stop for you, the weather is unpredictable at best and the public transportation is great but takes a while to get used to.
Eighteen days, by no means, is nearly enough time to call a place home, but life will surprise you. Everyone I’ve met here, my fellow classmates and the program directors have allowed for a smooth transition.
Another piece of advice — go on every excursion you can. Though these trips made me feel quite touristy, it also allowed me to really explore the city of London that I will call home for the next four months.
The people of London (for the most part) are some of the friendliest people you’ll ever meet. I suggest being open to meeting new people, as they’ll really make this experience, and the city come alive. For the times that you feel homesick, there’s nothing better than a call back home or simply hanging out with your flatmates. They’ll become your friends and second family on this journey of a lifetime.
