USC researchers are working to change how genomic data used for studying disease has been skewed to reflect white people. 
USC researchers in the Department of Translational Genomics are working with the Los Angeles County + USC Medical Center toward more representative genome data.
According to USC researchers in the Department of Translational Genomics, diversity among different racial and ethnic groups lies not only in culture, but also in genetic backgrounds. Because of this, certain illnesses disproportionately affect specific ethnic groups or demographics. Additionally, with language barriers and the lack of health care available to some ethnic minority groups, these populations have been more prone to these diseases. 
As a result, researchers are working with the Los Angeles County + USC Medical Center to attain a complete array of samples from Los Angeles’ population. 
“LAC’s collaboration with USC empowers researchers to study a clinical problem with accessibility to samples that are more representative of the population,” USC assistant professor Zarko Manojlovic told USC News. 
Manojlovic is the director of the USC Keck Genetic Platform,  which gives researchers at the University the ability to use DNA sequencing to provide answers to specific questions in research, according to USC News. 
The research team can use this platform for genomic research to process samples containing highly degraded nucleic acid species. Equipped with the NovaSeq sequencer, genomic studies can be performed faster and at a lower cost. 
“Between these capabilities and our in-house infrastructure, KGP will deliver a large reduction in cost,” Manojlovic told USC News. “This will let USC researchers ask more questions, to better understand and treat diseases.” 
KGP is one of many steps needed in order to properly attend to patients of all demographics, researchers said. Researchers will need to expand their studies to biomedical informatics, sample processing, computational infrastructure and expertise in data sets. 
“We will be able to answer questions that will have clinical impact across a true representation of the majority of the U.S. population,” John Carpten, director of the Institute of Translational Genomics, told USC News. “KGP will serve as the platform to help USC become the leading researching institute in the nation, and in the future of medicine.”

Prodigy, a feature film co-directed and written by USC alumni Alex Haughey and Brian Vidal, was digitally released March 13 on several platforms including Amazon and iTunes.

The sci-fi story revolves around a psychologist who works under a private sector of the military and is assigned to a nine-year-old patient with supernatural powers. Throughout the film, the psychologist dissects more about the patient’s intelligence and the truth behind her powers.
“For me, [the film] was always been about exploring the idea of guilt and what happens when we don’t allow ourselves to let go of that guilt [and] the kind of monsters we can become if we continue that path,” Vidal said. “I would hope someone watching the film would ultimately come out of it, feeling ‘Hey, when things seem hopeless, there is hope still there.’”
The actors had to put in a conscious effort to mask their own emotions in response to the events in Prodigy during filming.
“[It was difficult] to keep my sort of compassionate and empathetic stance throughout and to not react with any sort of frustration in anger, because there is a lot of frustration that can ensue during the course of the film,” said Richard Neil, one of the actors in the film.
The crew had to overcome substantial adversity to produce the film, Haughey said. They had to take on multiple roles due to their limited budget and small size. While co-directing and writing the screenplay, Haughey was additionally tasked with producing and casting while Vidal worked on editing.
Vidal and Haughey met in a general education course while studying for their undergraduate degrees at USC. Since then, they have worked in and out of the film industry, picking up short films and other job opportunities.
“I didn’t know what cinematography meant [before going to USC],” Vidal said. “I didn’t actually understand any of the concepts, it was all just me going with stuff that was interesting. I didn’t have any sort of technical craft that went alongside with that original inspiration. So I think USC took that raw, natural ability and formed that into something where decisions can be made about things on set.”
Vidal and Haughey had worked together before Prodigy. Their first feature film premiered last March at the Cinequest Film Festival.
“I think that the best part of this whole process was that we took this film to festivals,” Haughey said. “We finally got it done and took it to festivals, where the audience didn’t know anything about it the film. To see them react to the moments, the scenes, and the overall arc of the story that we tried so hard to get right for the people, was unlike anything I’ve experienced before.”

When former USC graduate student David Jonathan Brown was charged with fatally stabbing neuroscience professor Bosco Tjan in the Seeley G. Mudd Building in December 2016, the availability of safety resources on campus came into question. 
In response to this incident, the University established the Office of Campus Wellness and Crisis Intervention and then hired its first ever Chief Threat Assessment Officer, Patrick Prince, to increase safety resources for USC students and staff in Fall 2017. 
Prince’s department in the office helps with the creation of the cardinal folder, a document containing all of the emergency response information that will be disclosed to faculty, students and staff before the end of the year. Creating the cardinal folder forces the University to review all of the emergency response team contact information for accuracy. 
“We are gathering our data, putting it in one place and making it accessible to everybody in the University,” Prince said. 
Once it is updated, the information will be placed in an official document for the USC community. 
According Varun Soni, vice provost of campus wellness and crisis intervention, Prince has been playing a critical role in assessing threats outside of the University and is a significant addition to the Office of Campus Wellness and Crisis Intervention.
“[Prince] was hired because he is a national leader in threat assessment and has worked nearly 2,000 cases of workplace violence in his career,” Soni said. “He also helped build the threat assessment protocols for the California State University system, the largest university system in the United States.” 
Working at USC is like returning home for Prince. Born and raised in California, Prince comes from a long legacy at USC — both his parents attended the school, and his son is a recent graduate. 
Prince said his job here at USC is to identify potential violence before it occurs. By identifying sources of harm, Prince said it is easier to intervene into these incidents in a meaningful way.
“We know that violence, especially lethal violence in university or workplace venues, is never sudden,” Prince said. “It’s never unexpected. There are always opportunities to identify.”
Prince determines these targets of violence by working with different units within the University to identify behaviors of concern and then provide ways that reduce the risk of the concerned behavior. Prince said he collaborates with representatives from human resources and legal counsel, and professionals from the USC Center for Work and Family Life. 
One of Prince’s goals as a chief threat assessment officer for the Office of Campus Wellness and Crisis Intervention is to leave behind a self-sustaining office. By establishing relationships with the USC Suzanne Dworak-Peck School of Social Work, the USC Dornsife College of Letters, Arts and Sciences and the USC Rossier School of Education, Prince has been training graduate students interested in threat assessment to think like him and his peers when dealing with threatening situations. 
One such graduate student is Benjamin Kallin, an intern at the Office of Campus Wellness and Crisis Intervention. Working alongside Prince has provided Kallin with the opportunity to track case management data and behavioral threat assessments. 
Additionally, Kallin is developing a training curriculum for the office to identify “high risk areas” on the internet when establishing a presence on social media. This program will have people comb through and reduce the information and data on the internet.
“[The curriculum is a] way to coach people on going through all of their information and data that’s out there, and ways to reduce it going forward,” Kallin said. 
Kallin said that working with Prince has inspired him to continue pursuing his graduate degree in public administration and social work. 
“It has completely changed my trajectory, and I can’t see myself doing anything else,” Kallin said. “It just speaks to Patrick and his ability to get people interested in this field.”
