Inaugural Woogie Weekend in Silverado, CA July 17-19. Mariya Dondonyan | Daily Trojan
Woogie Weekend, a Do Lab production, was a weekend filled with nonstop, melodic house music, intimate vibes, and flooded stages as the rain created an unexpected turn towards the end of the festival on Sunday evening.
The inaugural weekend of the festival premiered July 17-19 at the home base of where Lightning in a Bottle all began in Silverado, California. Woogie Weekend lived beyond any expectation as festival goers experienced an expansion of their beloved Woogie Stage from LiB.
During the day, the rain helped make the planned Slip n Slide more epic, generating more slippery water for the slide. The Do Lab brought along water props and festival goers threw on their bathing suits for races down the hills on colorful blown up animals.
The festival vibes didn’t stop even after downpour fell over the stages late Sunday afternoon during the set of Autograf. Some festival attendees decided to pack up their tents early before the rain flooded campsites, and left home, while most stayed and danced in the rain until the sun went down and the storm had calmed. The entire vibe and atmosphere changed in the space as the Hive Stage closed down and everyone splashed in shin deep puddles at the Beat Nest Stage.
The Do Lab created a space and community of people where a natural bond between festival goers is almost instantly made. The intimacy of the venue allowed the festival to feel like a small family gathering, as attendees ran into the same people often throughout the weekend.
The moment music stopped playing at the main stages, after parties commenced in the campgrounds, filling the entire weekend with never ending house music. Dusk and Dawn stages were erected in that honor in the campgrounds and Woogie Weekend was on infinite loop for three incredible and unforgettable days.
