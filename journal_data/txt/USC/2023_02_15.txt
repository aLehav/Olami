The Undergraduate Student Government in a Senate meeting Tuesday unanimously passed a resolution calling on the University to provide support to students who were affected by the 7.8-magnitude earthquake in Turkey and Syria. 
Co-executive director of the Middle Eastern and North African Student Assembly Nour Myra Geha said she was frustrated because the community received “no support from USC as an institution.” She cited President Carol Folt’s single post on her social media accounts and the University’s inability to send support emails to students of Middle Eastern and North African descent because of a lack of data. The Office of International Affairs only sent out emails to students that have not yet been naturalized, Geha said, overlooking students who grew up in the region but have since gained citizenship.
“A lot of our students feel [survivor’s guilt],” Geha said. “The only thing that we can do in order to take a step forward from that is [help] as much as we can, and this is what we’re asking.”
Senate Bill 142-45 called on the Office of the Provost to rectify the lack of accommodations for Turkish and Syrian students and to release a Universitywide statement regarding the earthquake. It also called for a more thorough method of identifying Turkish and Syrian students to further help outreach.
The first earthquake began in the early hours of the morning on Feb. 6 near the border between Turkey and Syria, and was followed by a 6.7-magnitude aftershock. The disaster displaced more than 5 million people and the death toll — having surpassed 40,000 at the time of publication — is continuing to rise as more people are being found beneath the rubble. 
Senator Sam Habibi encouraged those present to donate to civilian cleanup efforts, drawing on his experience living in the Middle East to explain the severity of the situation.
“When something like this happens, it’s totally different when it happens here. All those people that you see pulling people out of broken structures [are] all civilians,” Habibi said. “Any dollar or any way you can help goes such a long way, especially in those countries.”
Senator Aidan Feighery said this was not the first time during the school year that the University had neglected to provide adequate support to students in need, citing a similar bill USG passed in September in the wake of the war in Armenia. The bill called on the Office of the Provost and President Carol Folt to send a universitywide statement raising awareness and support about the issue. Following the resolution’s passing, the University agreed to create better guidelines regarding when to post for student support — a promise it failed to keep, Feighery said.
“The fact that they haven’t made a more significant post yet or any sort of social media recognition means that those guidelines are either clearly not made yet or they need significant attention,” Feighery said. “I want to state my commitment to making that a legislative project in the future.”
Senator Navya Singh gave updates on projects currently in the works, including an update to the shared Lyft, 24-hour dining options and making Grammarly available for free for students. Singh’s projects are still in the first stages of planning.
Monica Rodriguez gave updates on her initiative to create murals at USC Village in collaboration with local artists from the South Central community. She is currently in the process of securing approval from University Village administration to begin work on the murals, she said. 
“We want to start small so we can get feedback and see if there’s any hype [from] students before we expand to something bigger,” Rodriguez said.

Car thefts around Los Angeles hit the gas last year with a reported 25,400 stolen vehicles, a 4% increase over the previous year. Nationwide, car theft rose by roughly 7% in 2022, a number set to be broken again in 2023.
The issue is especially prevalent throughout South Central, including the immediate area surrounding USC. Despite the University’s security efforts, vehicles parked on and around campus are not immune. Since January, 129 cases of vehicle theft have been reported in the Los Angeles Police Department’s southwest region — an 11% increase from last year’s 115 thefts within the same timeframe. 
According to open data made available by GeoHub, an online repository operated by the city of L.A., vehicle thefts were the second most reported crime in the last decade in the Exposition Park neighborhood encompassing the University, only outclassed by petty theft. When ranked, South Central placed sixth most for car theft around the city last year at 695 incidents. Neighboring Downtown, Boyle Heights, and Koreatown placed first, second and fourth respectively. 
Daniel Palmore, a sophomore majoring in journalism, returned to his vehicle damaged after an attempted burglary at the USC Shrine Structure last semester.
“I saw a mark on my window like some kind of stain … When I kept touching it I eventually heard the glass start to shatter as if it was gonna break and then the whole thing just shattered,” Palmore said. 
After further review by the Department of Public Safety, officers concluded the perpetrator attempted to enter the vehicle by burning through the window. Palmore said his roommate, who was unavailable for comment, also experienced an attempted break-in while keeping his vehicle parked in the same structure earlier that semester.
Hana Feingold, a junior majoring in international relations and human security and geospatial intelligence, had her 2014 Kia Soul stolen in a USC-owned parking structure on 28th Street this past summer. After reporting the vehicle stolen to DPS and the LAPD, Feingold said she was told to expect little to no recourse. 
“A lot of cars get stolen around here,” Feingold said an officer told her. “The chances that we find your car are very low.”
A tow company recovered Feingold’s vehicle the next day. Sections of the vehicle were cut out or removed, and a window shattered for entry. 
Feingold is one of many who have had their Kia or Hyundai stolen throughout the United States, in what online communities have dubbed he “Kia Challenge.” In a viral series of TikTok videos, the creators demonstrate how to override and start a Kia’s ignition system with only a USB port. Targeted vehicles include Hyundais from 2015 to 2021 and Kias from 2011 to 2012. 
One contributing factor to the high number of thefts is the lack of CCTV cameras around campus. Lot 27 is one of many parking lots without cameras in and around campus. 
Merton Li, a junior majoring in business administration, came back to find his car damaged after he had left it in the Downey Way parking structure on campus two weeks ago. Despite Downey’s prime location on campus, the garage features only one CCTV camera at the entrance. In a 2016 University of Tennessee study, researchers concluded that CCTV surveillance is effective in reducing car theft within parking garages. 
In a statement to the Daily Trojan Thursday, DPS Assistant Chief David Carlisle confirmed there is only one camera in the garage. 
“DPS regularly patrols the structures in both cars and on bicycles,” the statement read. “There are relatively few car thefts and car break-ins on campus.”
Carlisle instead attributed the rise in motor vehicle theft to incidents involving motorized scooters, which DPS also classifies as motor vehicles. 
Some students said they still believe more security measures should be in place.
“If they have money to construct a new building [Ginsburg Hall, for the Viterbi School of Engineering] … they should be able to implement a simple camera system for each floor [of a parking garage],” Li said. 
Li, Palmore and Feingold all said their experiences have changed the way they handled their vehicles within the area. Li said he now avoids parking at USC entirely.
“I usually try to park my car now where there are people around,” Palmore said, “so that if someone is trying to mess with my car, someone will at least be there to see it and maybe report that it’s happening.”
Correction: An earlier version of this article misstated Carlisle’s occupation. He is currently the assistant chief at the Department of Public Safety, not the interim executive director/chief. The Daily Trojan regrets this error.

Student Health is partnering with a student-led chapter of the Mann School of Pharmacy and Pharmaceutical Sciences to host NaloxoneSC, a weekly naloxone distribution program that aims to combat the nation’s ongoing fentanyl crisis, said Chief Health Officer Dr. Sarah Van Orman in a briefing with the Daily Trojan Tuesday.
Naloxone, notably sold under the brand name NARCAN, is a nasal spray designed to reverse the effects of opioids in the event of an overdose. Fentanyl overdoses, in particular, usually occur by accident because the drug is used to adulterate other drugs — like cocaine, oxycodone or hydrocodone — without the consumer’s knowledge.
“We want students to be aware that, if they are choosing to use those kinds of drugs that are being procured, whether it be cocaine or [anything] else, that they should really be testing any drugs for fentanyl before they use them,” Van Orman said. “I encourage those individuals as well to become familiar with … Naloxone, to be comfortable using it — because they might be able to respond in an emergency and really save somebody’s life.”
Data on campus drug use has not been updated consistently since the pandemic, but Van Orman said she estimates that around 5% to 10% of undergraduates are using cocaine, ecstasy or other opioids without prescription.
“That’s a small number, but it’s not zero,” Van Orman said. “We know that in certain houses or communities, that number might be much higher.”
Van Orman said there have been instances where students survived fentanyl-related overdoses, but there have also been a number of deaths from fentanyl-related overdoses among students. 
“While the numbers are small … The consequence is so high from this, that a single death is really a tragedy, and we want to try to prevent every one,” Van Orman said. “We want to let students know that there is access to treatment.”
While instances of overdosing are more likely to occur among students who have an opioid addiction, Van Orman said that accidental overdoses can occur even to students who are occasional drug users.
“It only takes one use if that drug is adulterated with fentanyl to unfortunately have a deadly outcome,” Van Orman said. “So it is really important for any student to be aware of and part of their decision making around if they’re choosing to use drugs that are not prescribed to them.”
Naloxone kits will be available for pickup every Wednesday through April 5 at the Trojan Farmers Market in McCarthy Quad. Kits will include naloxone as well as test strips to detect the presence of fentanyl in drugs. Students can pick up a kit after watching a 10-minute training video, completing a short quiz and signing an attestation form. Pharmacy students will also be available via Zoom to answer questions.
Student Health also has counseling and mental health resources available through their partnership with The Haven, an outpatient substance treatment program with a location on campus.
Coronavirus cases on campus amounted to 30 new cases last week. Student Health will continue to reevaluate the vaccine policy for the Fall 2023 semester. As of now, Van Orman said she recommends staying up to date with vaccinations.
“We’re continuing to support people with the same messages, which are: Test if you get sick we still have all of our testing available, and then make sure that you are up to date on your vaccines,” Van Orman said. “We are — here on campus and in our community — entering a new phase in the pandemic … recognizing that the virus is staying with us, but we have the tools to manage it.”

The latest addition to the Tutor Campus Center is packed with flavorful Italian delights that would give even Chef Boyardee a run for his money. The menu offers a wide selection for students to choose from, including classic marinara spaghetti, creamy fettuccine alfredo with chicken, zesty limone penne and meaty bolognese pasta. Located within the TCC food court, Filone’s is positioned along the right wall and shares its kitchen utilities with Slice Shop, a pizza restaurant.
After a few soft openings in early January, Filone’s officially had its grand opening on Jan. 17, making itself available to the public for the start of the new semester.
Filone’s is outfitted with a modern kitchen and a window that opens outside to the plaza for mobile orders. The ordering kiosks nearest them inside the food court only provide service to Filone’s and Slice Shop. 
As debates and criticisms continue to roll in regarding the newest pasta kitchen at USC, here is a taste review of three of the most popular meal-swipe combinations at Filone’s.
Alfredo Pasta Combo
A traditional and well-known selection, the alfredo pasta is the first item listed on the kiosk’s meal-swipe combinations. This pasta is a classic take on the Italian dish with its fettuccine noodles, alfredo sauce, butter, parmesan cheese and parsley seasoning to top it off.
Cooked to al dente, the meal relies heavily on the cheese to add a creamy texture that makes it distinct from its distant relative, the limone pasta. There is an overall balance between ingredients, but the meager portions given to the customer equates it to the alfredo from any entree meal in the frozen aisle of a grocery store. While the alfredo overall lacks the luster it portrays on the kiosk, it still remains one of the top dishes for the kitchen due to its flavorful seasoning. 
The House Caesar Combo
By far this review’s most regrettable purchase, the house Caesar combo falls into the same category of appearing — and tasting — distinctively different than expected. 
Despite its straightforward construction of chopped romaine lettuce, parmesan cheese, crouton crumbles and Caesar dressing, the salad combo is a swipe that could be better used on another item.
Although the salad was far better than the selections offered at the residential dining halls, the Caesar dressing is just a close copy of those found at supermarkets. 
Despite being a healthier option than pasta, the salad shrinks in comparison to the value of a carb-heavy pasta dish and is difficult to finish without something to neutralize one’s palate. 
Marinara Pasta Combo
Where the alfredo falls short, the marinara makes up for the loss. The marinara pasta is a combination of spaghetti pasta served with slow-roasted tomato sauce and then topped with parmesan cheese and parsley. This entree delivers the delectable flavor often missing from meal-swipe offerings on campus.
From top to bottom, the al dente pasta is covered in marinara sauce, giving a forkful of ingredients with every bite. 
Its powerful sauce creates a wave of deliciousness that warms the taste buds and is a pleasant surprise for doubtful diners.
Compared to the other pasta offered by Filone’s, the marinara cements itself high above the rest of the offerings.
It still seems that USC has a long way to go in surpassing its rival, UCLA, in replacing it as the No. 1 in the nation for college dining. Yet, through these changes and inclusions of meals, USC is headed in the right direction to formulate an assortment of delicacies from all around the globe for a university made up of people from all around the globe.

Whose stories are told? What do those stories say about how history and magical folklore intersect? Where does one fit into these ancestral stories that are either lost to time or intentionally hidden? These are questions that USC senior Seanna Latiff comments on in her exhibition, “often heard, but rarely seen,” which is currently on view at the Helen Lindhurst Fine Arts Gallery in Watt Hall.
The exhibition — which covers all four walls of the gallery, a feat Latiff is particularly proud of — is the result of her trip to Trinidad and Tobago that she funded with Roski’s Macomber Travel Grant she was awarded last spring. Latiff was born in Trinidad and immigrated to the United States when she was six years old. Her Macomber Grant trip was her first time returning to the country in 11 years.
“There is a wealth of stories [in Trinidad and Tobago],” Latiff said. “Not just stories for stories’ sake, but stories rooted in history and rooted in resilience through oppression.”
These stories are woven throughout Latiff’s work and the richness of Trinidadian folklore shines alongside her own family’s history. One work, which spans an entire wall of the gallery hall, incorporates family pictures from Trinidad’s Carnival, images of indigenous Trinidadian history and a contemplative text monologue in the background. In the top left corner of the work sits a pygmy owl, a Trinidadian symbol of death and the inspiration for the exhibition’s title.
The pygmy owl appears in several of Latiff’s works in the exhibition and serves as an omnipresent reminder of death — not a grim, overpowering fear but a quieter symbol of ancestry and heritage.
“So much of my practice is about death, and it’s not the dark and gloomy aspect of it, but about … alchemizing those feelings and seeing how [to] shine light on what we’re afraid of,” Latiff said.
This is not to say that Latiff’s work shies away from more visceral aspects of death and the human body. Some of her self-portraits and her zine (a small self-published artwork in magazine form), “Birdshit,” border on body horror. In these works, Latiff often represents herself as a patchwork, commenting on her multicultural identity. 
Seanna Latiff said Soraya Latiff, her sister, was an important inspiration for the exhibit. In one of the most striking works, a clear portrait of Soraya Latiff sits cross-legged, with family matriarchs resting their hands on her shoulders, their faces notably blurred and lost to time. 
The first work Seanna Latiff created specifically for the exhibition shows her and Soraya as young girls enveloped in the wings of a large owl. Seanna Latiff said that this owl is meant to represent the Chickcharney, a mythological creature. According to Trinidadian folklore, the owl is both a protector and a symbol of death and habitat loss. In this work, as in many others of her portraits, Seanna Latiff draws an explicit connection between magic and her place in her culture.
Referencing the title of her exhibition, owls are often heard but unseen in the gallery space. “A Call to Owls,” an auditory work created by one of Seanna Latiff’s friend, April Levin, combines bird calls and crashing waves and plays on a loop in the gallery hall. Taken in conjunction with Seanna Latiff’s visual works, the audio’s mood changes: Sometimes it is mysterious, other times somber and other times almost welcoming.
Her artistic process? “Screaming, crying, throwing up,” Seanna Latiff said. She chose to represent this process through a self-portrait in which she painted herself as Soucouyant, a woman who, according to Trinidadian folklore, sheds her skin each night to become a raging ball of fire.
“I’d like to leave you with the knowing that magic is real,” Seanna Latiff wrote in a note near the visitor log book. “The best is yet to come.”

Like many, I was shocked when I learned that HYBE Entertainment’s new girl group, NewJeans, was made up of members all born in 2004 or later. Hyein (혜인), the youngest member (the maknae), is turning 15 in April. 
In terms of K-pop, people attack HYBE because they are one of the “Big 4” entertainment companies that dominate the K-pop realm. NewJeans’ debut was a pretty big deal for a corporation that previously succeeded solely on boy groups, serving as the home company for BTS, TXT, SEVENTEEN and ENHYPEN. But HYBE was not the first entertainment company to debut idols at such a young age. 
One of my current K-pop obsessions is CLASS:y, a seven-member girl group managed by M25. Although they’re rather unknown — 161 thousand followers on Instagram and nearly 300,000 monthly listeners on Spotify — they’ve been releasing music for almost a year and have an impressive discography. At the time of their debut in May 2022, their maknae, Seonyou (선유), and their second youngest, Boeun (보은), had both just turned 14. 
Young idols started popping up around third generation K-pop, the nomer given to artists who debuted during the early 2010s. BTS debuted Jungkook (정국) at 15 in 2013. Jisung (지성) from NCT DREAM debuted at 14 in 2016. Jiheon (지헌) from fromis_9 debuted at 14 in 2018. Ni-ki (니키) from ENHYPEN made his I-Land appearance in 2020 at 14. The issue is not that there are now young idols, but rather the frequency with which they are debuting. 
It is my personal opinion that it’s fine to have idols that are so young. Hear me out.
In the United States, we have a shameful history of exploiting young teens and children for entertainment. Take “Toddlers & Tiaras” or “Dance Moms,” for example. These are scripted shows that dramatize children for adult viewers. Although it is more common for K-pop idols to come out of survival or reality shows, they are nowhere near as intrusive or falsified as many in popular Western media. We do it much worse.
If a child has the dreams of becoming a pop star at the age of 13, they should be able to pursue those dreams. However, there are valid concerns about the K-pop industry in general that apply more intensely to idols under the age of 18.  
Many people take issue with the relentlessly revealing outfits that female idols typically perform in. Similarly, a lot of K-pop choreography, although usually pretty innocent unless aiming for a certain aesthetic, can have sexual implications. 
My counter to this point is: Idols are not responsible for the reactions of their audiences. This ideology can be applied to general life as well — if an outfit or costume is not inherently sexual, don’t make it sexual. For this statement in particular, I ask my audience to watch some of CLASS:y’s stage performances. Yes, the girls are usually in slightly cropped tops or tank tops with some form of a skirt or shorts, but there isn’t anything sexual about it. And the same goes for their dancing. Just don’t make it sexual. 
People may retort that companies should be protecting their idols from people with malintent, and that if we know there’s going to be sexualization, then precautions should be taken to protect the performers. The world sucks, absolutely, but it’s going to suck regardless of if Boeun shows her whole arm or just the elbows down. That is to say, if someone has the intention of sexualizing a young girl who’s dancing her heart out on stage, they’re likely going to do so regardless of what she’s wearing. 
The bigger issue aside from dance and costume is the toxic culture that K-pop idols are forced into. Diets, cosmetic surgery, the constant pressure of being on camera all the time — that’s what I think is more draining. 
This toxic culture is a bigger industry problem, not just something that affects younger idols. Rather than focusing on the toxicity that may affect a young artist, it’s better to try and advocate for broader change, or at least for recognition of the intense and borderline horrible working conditions. 
But what about school? What about their education if becoming an idol doesn’t work out? One, most, if not all, idols continue their education throughout their training and debut while still in school. Although training, performing and being an idol in general most definitely makes the process more arduous, it’s part of the job description. It’s also not fair to expect someone to go to college when that’s not part of their goal. 
If a young teen and their family decide they want to put themselves through the rigorous life of a K-pop idol, then that’s a valid decision. Many kids dream of becoming superstars, so it’s fair to give them that shot. 
I truly believe that as long as a management company is able to treat and compensate their artists well, then there isn’t really an issue with this aspect of the industry. It’s been happening for years, it’s just that now it’s happening more frequently.

Hey everyone, welcome back. I wanted to start this column by wishing you a happy New Year.
Yes, I realize I’m around … a month and a half late? But still, cut me some slack; this is my first column of the semester. And as every responsible homeowner will tell you, the first thing you do when you come back from a long break is to put everything in order. In my case, that means going over all the important stuff that went down before the start of my column. 
Now relax; I won’t do it in one fell swoop. After all, one measly column wouldn’t be enough to talk about all the issues that occurred over the past few months. So, instead, I’ll use this column to focus on something that went relatively unnoticed by major news outlets, but could have some real impact on those of us who enjoy esports as a whole.
Yes, that’s right, I’ll be talking about Ludwig becoming the co-owner of Moist Esports. 
For those who have been reading this column for a long time, you’ll probably remember Moist Esports from the column I wrote when the team was created. But for those of you who haven’t been around that long, Moist Esports is essentially an esports organization like any other, except that it is owned, created and operated by famous Twitch streamer Charles “MoistCr1TiKal” White Jr. In the column, I speculated on the team’s future. And while some of my observations hold up, I’m sad to say I left the biggest differential completely unnoticed: revenue. 
The reality is that many esports teams are highly unprofitable. Many teams have difficulty finding ways to generate profit because esports, in general, are still in a weird limbo between real sports and a niche audience. They have no option but to rely on investors, who, for one reason or another, usually end up leaving after a few years. Even FaZe Clan, one of the most famous esports teams that has gone public with their stock, has fallen on hard times. 
Moist Esports is no exception to this. White has routinely talked about how expensive the team is and how often it’s running on a net loss when it comes to earnings. But unlike all those other examples, Moist Esports doesn’t have to worry much about revenue. 
Because this time, the CEO is also the major investor. In other words, given that White is a successful streamer, he can single-handedly maintain the team’s financial viability solely through the revenue he earns as a content creator. Unlike the other investors, he will not abandon ship after a couple of years, and the team can focus on training because they don’t have to worry about suddenly downsizing.
The problem with this is that, naturally, it puts all the onus on White. If Moist Esports expands a bit too much, if he had a rough month streaming or wants to spend his money on something more expensive, the team would suffer as a result. It’s essentially like putting a band-aid on a deep cut: It’ll work for now, but if you don’t come in with better treatment it’ll lead to worse problems down the road. 
That is where Ludwig Ahgren comes in. A famous streamer in his own right, his decision to become co-owner of the company spells good news for the future of this business model. In the video he used to explain his decision, Ahgren outlines three potential forms of longstanding revenue for Moist Esports, most of which boil down to leaning into their abilities as content creators. 
Unlike the current business model that is akin to throwing coal at a furnace to keep a train running, the strategies that Ahgren offered, such as joint packaging to sponsors and using the team to sell original products, are genuinely more sustainable for the long run and less dependent on how the streamer is doing on any given month. By creating this interdependency or symbiosis between content creators and their teams, neither side is overburdened and can continue focusing on their respective roles. The CEOs will still have to deal with the brunt of the decisions, but less in an “atlas holding the weight of the world” kind of way and more like a normal company executive. 
Of course, the suggestions Ludwig proposed are no silver bullet. After all, they still rely on the fact that the owners are content creators to generate revenue and thus haven’t made the product any more viable on its own. Who knows, maybe no sponsors will want to make that joint deal, and maybe the amount of capital needed to create a whole product that your team sells is just too much. But as of right now, his comments offer a possible future for the industry. 
As creators continue to grow in numbers, Moist Esports will likely be the team they all keep an eye on. Because if Ahgren and White manage to turn this team into something viable, even if they still have to use their position as content creators as leverage, then we may be seeing a sneak peek into what the industry will look like in the near future.

According to urban legend and The Washington Post, sororities can’t host their own parties because if a certain number of women live in a house with alcohol inside, the law dictates that it’s a brothel. While the reasoning behind this policy is just a legend, sororities still aren’t allowed to host their own parties, unlike their fraternity counterparts.
As an advocate for survivors of sexual assault on campus, I am personally not a fan of Greek life and think that USC would be better off without it. That being said, I don’t think it’s possible anytime soon, so in the meantime we should focus on making Greek life safer for the multitude of survivors who participate in it — and that starts with sororities having the right to host their own parties.
Sororities and fraternities answer to different national leadership and therefore follow different guidelines — guidelines that are much stricter for sororities. The 26 sororities that are members of the National Panhellenic Conference, including nine out of the ten members of Panhellenic at USC, are subject to the rules of the conference that dictate alcohol is not allowed in sorority houses and therefore they are not allowed to host their own parties. The reasoning that NPC gives for this rule is that it cuts down on insurance costs for members — but at whose expense?
In an interview with The Washington Post, Cindy Stellhorn — the executive vice president of MJ Insurance’s Sorority Division — said that for sorority members, insurance policies cost from $25 to $50 a year, while fraternity members pay up to $180. Sorority members already pay an exorbitant amount of money to join and continue membership in their sorority, with USC Panhellenic’s website stating that new member fees range from $2,588 to $3,775 per semester. While the difference between insurance costs is significant, money should never be a factor when determining who receives protection and who doesn’t.
Studies consistently show that merely being in a sorority increases risk for sexual assault exponentially, with one study reporting that 48% of sorority members experienced nonconsensual sexual contact in their time on campus. Compared to the rest of campus, sorority members are 74% more likely to be assaulted — a significant figure on a campus like USC’s that already has a higher than average rate of 1 in 3 female undergraduate students experiencing sexual assault before graduation. If merely joining an organization jeopardizes your safety, that organization should be responsible for the insurance costs of keeping you safe.
NPC claims that this policy maintains its founding goals of “scholarship, leadership, and engagement on campus — all of which are principles that lead them to prioritize substance-free living environments.” While I don’t necessarily think this is a bad idea, it does force members who wish to use substances like alcohol into unsafe environments. The only way for a sorority to host a party with alcohol is to co-host with a fraternity or to use a third-party vendor (like a bar or party venue), both of which take members out of the safety of their homes.
While alcohol is not necessary for a good party, the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism reports that more than 80% of college students drink alcohol to some degree. Banning sororities from having alcohol just pushes members to find it elsewhere. Underage and binge drinking is a prevalent issue all campuses need to work against, but if sororities have the choice to host parties, the possibilities for safer conditions could significantly reduce one aspect of the danger that comes with drinking — especially with the prevalence of sexual assault in Greek life.
Multiple studies have shown that people in fraternities are three times more likely to commit rape than their non-Greek counterparts. At parties, they have all the power. The party is in their house, where dozens of their brothers live and they get to decide who gets in. But if sororities had control of the physical space of the party, they could bar anyone they are uncomfortable around or whom they know have a history of sexual assault with one of their peers from even entering. They could also stop people from going upstairs to a secluded area where people may be left alone with a perpetrator.
In an interview with The Washington Post, a George Washington University student explained that at parties run by girls, the group can be much more protective and keep an eye on each other. 
“At frat parties, it’s more of a hunting ground,” they said. “Not all guys are like this, of course, but sometimes it feels like the lions standing in the background and looking at the deer. And then they go in for the kill.”
There are downsides to having hundreds of people drinking and partying in your house every few weeks, and I can understand not wanting to live with that while trying to succeed in school. But no one has to live in their sorority or fraternity house, and somehow I think sororities at USC would manage to find money for a cleaning service in their massive budgets. 
At the end of the day, are a few budget cuts worth putting sorority members in harm’s way? Personally, I think sororities have the responsibility to ensure that their members are safe at a party, even if it means a higher overhead cost for them. But it seems as though economics has trumped the value of safety once again.

February is a month chock-full of things to celebrate — the Super Bowl, Valentine’s Day and, most importantly, Black History Month. And what better way to celebrate than a party? Whether it’s Galentine’s and Palentine’s or Super Bowl Sunday with a large bowl of chips for you and all your friends to share, most of us will inevitably end up at a party of sorts. 
This was the plan for USC’s Gakusei Kai House, better known as the GAK House, which provides affordable housing for a select group of low-income students navigating university. However, recently, the GAK House came to Instagram to announce their cancellation of their “Gakentine’s Party.” It was not the party’s cancellation that startled me, but the reason why it was canceled. Due to Black History Month, the GAK House offered a discounted entry fee to Black students. A gesture made in good faith quickly soured as the GAK House received backlash from students, some of whom threatened to show up to the party in blackface. 
Blackface holds a horrific and tragic history. As defined by Merriam-Webster, blackface is “dark makeup worn to mimic the appearance of a Black person and especially to mock or ridicule Black people.” Blackface took root in the 1800s with the practice of minstrelsy — a theatrical form that intended to entertain its audience with a performance of “Blackness.” By “Blackness,” I mean white people dressed in costumes and black-painted faces. 
Minstrelsy rose to popularity between the 1850s and 1870s in the United States and Britain, most notably post-Civil War, and delivered messages that enforced white superiority. It was simple: “whiteness” was acceptable, and Black people were seen as inferior — a joke. Although the world of minstrelsy is not what it once was, blackface still carries the hurt of years dedicated to belittling Black people. It is disappointing and baffling that a simple discount prompted these vile threats. 
Unfortunately, I cannot say situations like these are one-in-a-million, especially on college campuses. ​​Just in my two years at USC, I have been followed at Target by associates, endured professors who handle the delicate matter of race with carelessness and heard a professor say, “Because it’s in the text, I feel as though I can say the N-word, but I can’t pull it off today.” But this is not just a USC issue. 
Pew Research reports that 81% of Black students say they’ve faced discrimination due to race or ethnicity. In comparison, 59% of Black people who have never attended college face this mistreatment. This is incredibly daunting, especially in the lens of USC, where the Black student population is only 5.8%.
Hate crimes, a criminal offense often motivated by bias against race, religion, ethnicity, sexual orientation or other grounds, shot up drastically in the past few years. In 2016, more than 1,000 hate crimes were committed on college campuses nationwide. No matter how diverse a campus is, no university campus is immune to hate crimes and discrimination. Quite frankly, it’s exhausting. It’s hard enough juggling academics, relationships and the professional world, but Black students must also balance racism — even in the “woke” 21st century. 
W.E.B Du Bois coined the term “double consciousness,” which expresses the struggle the Black community endures while attempting to embrace their culture and conform to a predominantly white society. Especially at a historically white institution like USC, it is a struggle not to waver when things like this occur. And the sheer radio silence about what unfortunately happened to the GAK House booms louder than any party music playlist. 
Now, I’m no comedian, but I can certainly tell when a joke is humorous or not. Hearing the word “blackface” didn’t make me giggle, it made me shudder. Raúl Pérez said it best in his book, “The Souls of White Jokes:” “Rather than being harmless fun, this humor plays a central role in reinforcing and mobilizing racist ideology and power under the guise of amusement,” he wrote. I would have never imagined that I would experience this issue in university, especially at USC, which prides itself on its steps toward diversity. But that’s the thing about racism: It comes in all forms — whether overt or covert, it’s there. And it’s saddening. 
Words hold weight. Language surpasses time and barriers, and the stains left by racism cannot be ignored or treated lightly. Unlike what they teach at the Jimmy Kimmel School of Comedy, blackface is not a joke. Threatening to show up to a party in blackface so you can save yourself a couple of dollars definitely shouldn’t have even been a thought, much less an option. So, yes, February is the month of chocolates and flowers, the Chiefs versus the Eagles. However, it also seems like the month for some much-needed reflection.

The stage is set for a Trojan counterattack as the No. 12 USC men’s volleyball team hosts Grand Canyon University twice this week, Wednesday and Friday night at Galen Center. 
The 6-4 Trojans have endured a tough schedule so far, with five matches against ranked opponents and only one home match. The Lopes, on the other hand, have cruised to an undefeated 11-0 record but have benefited from nine home matches and only three ranked matchups. 
The teams’ matchups this week represent a reversal of fortune: The Trojans, coming off a week and a half of rest, practice and preparation, will be beginning their first homestand of the season with a five-game stretch at Galen Center. The Lopes are facing a tough road stretch for the first time all season — four straight road games against ranked opponents, beginning with their clashes with the Trojans. In the end, the result will be decided not by who is facing a tougher task on paper, but instead by who excels on a square court with a net, and it’s the players on both sides that will factor into the result. 
GCU is hoping that its superstar-studded offense can continue to produce an output that has the entire country on notice. Their redshirt junior outside hitter, Jackson Hickman, was named AVCA national player of the week for the first week of February, the same week in which their redshirt sophomore setter Nicholas Slight won a Setter of the Week honor. It’s safe to say that the offense has been clicking on all cylinders, and following a dominant 3-0 sweep of Arizona Christian, they have never looked tougher to stop. But, the Trojans are meeting the Lopes’ haymaker of an offense with a crushing counterattack of a defense. 
“We’ve been really good on the defensive side of the ball, holding prolific offenses to way lower [hitting percentages] than they’re used to,” said Head Coach Jeff Nygaard. 
Excellent play from senior libero George Dyer has anchored that defense. A big key to Dyer’s success has been his ability to remain levelheaded and treat every point, no matter the circumstance, exactly the same. Dyer was levelheaded as usual when asked how the team was preparing for such a prolific offense. 
“We just keep going at our regular gameplan, one thing at a time,” Dyer said. “I think that will put us in a good position for success.”
Dyer’s steadiness also enables him to be one of the vocal leaders on the team, constantly encouraging and leading his teammates.
“It’s just about moving onto the next play, because you can’t change the past,” Dyer said. 
The Trojans will need Dyer’s reminders about resilience and refocus constantly for the rest of the season, because the games against GCU mark the beginning of MPSF conference play. Every game from now on will be critical and have little margin for error in a conference filled with ranked opponents. 
“[When] we go into conference, we know it’s a snakepit,” Nygaard said. “We know we’re USC and everyone wants to beat us, we know that’s just part of the gig. There’s no surprises in that regard.”
Fortunately, Nygaard is confident that his Trojans will rise to the challenge. 
“My guys just love to compete,” Nygaard said. “I know that, going into a match where this team is going to be ranked top five, I know we’re going to be mentally checked in. I know that we’re going to be mentally fired up for that.” 
It truly will be an exciting clash that no one on the team wants fans to miss. 
“The one game we did have at home was pretty electric,” Dyer said. “We just want to keep that energy going throughout the rest of the season … I really want to encourage anyone who is reading this that every voice matters, and is really helpful, and I’m really excited about what we’ve got going on this season.” 
As Dyer alluded to, Trojan fans only need to see the results of the first home game against UC Santa Barbara, which had a record-breaking crowd and an electric atmosphere, to have every reason to pack Galen Center this week. 
“We had the highest attendance the last time out, and a lot of people walked away just kind of blown away with the reality of what watching collegiate men’s volleyball is,” Nygaard said. “It’s a great product with great human beings, come on out and be a part.” 
Trojan fans will have double the opportunity to be a part of something special at Galen Center this week when the Trojans take on the GCU Lopes twice, Wednesday and Friday at 7 p.m.
