Well, a win is a win. That’s about all I can say about the Trojan’s performance against the Wildcats Saturday night in the first cold game we’ve had this year at the Coliseum. The Trojans took notice and came out the gates cold as ice. That might even be generous. Luckily, Coach Helton prides his team on making adjustments and that is just what the Trojans did to win the game. A couple big plays sparked the Trojan rally and they didn’t give the momentum back. In retrospect this is great, but we need to be coming out of the gates firing. If we play like we did in the first quarter against the likes of UCLA or Oregon then we might be left in the dust. There were some fantastic individual performances Saturday night to carry the Trojans to victory. It is great to see players stepping up and winning games instead of trying not to lose them.

Coach Clay Helton might not be winning the prettiest way, but he is winning. That is all you can ask for from an interim Head Coach. The ridiculous play or Ronald Jones really sparked the Trojans, but without solid play from Cody Kessler I don’t see the Trojans beating great teams. There needs to be a change in play calling and a shift in mindset for some of the players. These constant individual performances show that the Trojans are one of the most talented teams in the country. However, consistency needs to be built and the Trojans need to ride this momentum the rest of the way.
Prediction: USC 31 – Colorado 34
Fight On!

Sam Slam · Senior outside hitter Samantha Bricio and the No. 2 Women of Troy will host Oregon and Oregon State at the Galen Center on Wednesday and Thursday, respectively. The team has six games remaining in the regular season. – Brian Ji | Daily Trojan
The women’s volleyball team prepares to play Oregon and Oregon State on back-to-back nights this week, starting Wednesday versus the Ducks at the Galen Center. The No. 2 Women of Troy rebounded with two wins against Colorado and Utah last week, after suffering their first loss of the season against Washington at the end of October.
After the grueling, two-week, four-game road trip put an end to USC’s perfect season, head coach Mick Haley was glad to return home, where his players could recover and get back into their rhythm.
“We were gone for eight days and only home for six days,” he said. “That’s pretty darn hard when you’re trying to study at this institution.”
The team has certainly looked comfortable in the Galen Center this year, where they have only dropped five sets all season and sport a sparkling 13-0 record. The Women of Troy are in arguably the most grueling part of their regular season schedule, playing six games in 13 days beginning when their trip to Washington. The quick turnaround in this week’s games may raise concerns, but Haley isn’t worried.
“If you play hard one night, [you’re] ready to play the next night -— you’re still there,” he said. “It’s harder to play when you’re off a day and have to rebuild … that really takes its toll.”
Haley admitted the busy schedule was taxing, but he hailed the lively Galen Center crowd for energizing the team.
“If we have to do this, we want to do it at home,” he said. “I thought the crowd was great [against Colorado and Utah] … I hope they’ll come Wednesday and Thursday.”
The Women of Troy take on the Ducks and the Beavers not long after beating both teams on the road last month. USC brought home victories in both Corvallis and Eugene, winning a 3-1 contest against Oregon State and sweeping past Oregon, 3-0, two days later. Both opponents have had difficult seasons: The Ducks come to the Galen Center with six losses in their last nine matches, and Oregon State has won just three matches all season in Pac-12 play.
This week, however, more eyes may be on senior outside hitter Samantha Bricio than on the scoreboard. Bricio, who on Tuesday became just the ninth player in program history to be named the Sports Imports/AVCA National Player of the Week, is just 22 kills away from becoming the program’s all-time career kills leader. With 68 kills over her past three games, Bricio looks poised to make history this week.
To her teammates, though, Bricio’s contributions to her team go far beyond the box score. Junior libero Taylor Whittingham, who has played with Bricio for three years, praised her teammate’s presence as a captain.
“She’s just a great leader and a great person to have on the court,” she said. “She’s open, you’re able to bond with her and she’s a great player on top of all that.”
Haley also heaped praise on Bricio, adding that she would be a huge asset to the team come the NCAA tournament in December.
“If you look at the teams that have gone to the final four in the last six or seven years, everybody has had the go-to person: somebody who makes it OK for everyone else, who will take the team on her back when she needs to,” he said.
For now, however, the Trojans remain fully focused on earning two victories before heading off to Arizona next week. The team’s game-by-game mentality has allowed the players to remain grounded throughout the season as well as bounce back from tough matches.
“Obviously that’s the main goal: the tournament and the national championship,” Whittingham said. “But really, we’re just focusing on one game at a time.”
Wednesday’s matchup against Oregon will begin at 7:30 p.m., before Oregon State visits the Galen Center at the same time on Thursday.

Best of the best · Junior defender Kayla Mills was named Pac-12 Defensive Player of the Year on Tuesday. She is one of five Women of Troy to be honored. – Brian Ji | Daily Trojan
Junior defender Kayla Mills was named the Pac-12 Defensive Player of the Year on Tuesday while five other Trojans received Pac-12 honors as well.
Mills also earned All-Pac-12 first team honors for the second time in her career. She was named Pac-12 Defensive Player of the Week earlier this season. Mills started all of USC’s 20 games this season and finished with two goals and four assists. Mills and the rest of the USC defense tied for first in the Pac-12 with only five goals allowed in conference play. The Women of Troy played for 336 consecutive minutes, spanning five games, without allowing a goal.
Notre Dame transfer Morgan Andrews was also a Pac-12 first team honoree in her first season in the Pac-12. Andrews led the Trojans with seven goals on the season, including three game-winning goals. She also led the conference with 80 shots on goal. Her six goals and 18 points were enough to tie for third and finish sixth, respectively.
The Women of Troy have not had two All-Pac-12 first team honorees since 2005, when Amy Rodriguez and Rosa Anna Tantillo took home the awards.
Junior defender Mandy Freeman was named to the      All-Pac-12 second team, her third-straight season earning Pac-12 honors. Her nine points this year tied her for third on the team and she led the team with five assists. She was named Pac-12 Offensive Player of the Week earlier this season.
Redshirt junior goalkeeper Sammy Jo Prudhomme was recognized with All-Pac-12 honorable mention. Her .54 goals against average led the Pac-12 and ranked 12th nationally. Her 10 shutouts this season are enough to land her in third place on USC’s                                                         single-season list. She had a total of 61 saves in 1,820 minutes played in USC’s 20 games.
The four All-Pac-12 honorees are the most for the Trojans since 2010.
Freshman defender Ally Prisock was named to the Pac-12 All-Freshman team. Prisock had 14 complete games on the season. She led the Women of Troy in minutes played.
Mills and the Trojans will face Cal State Fullerton on Friday at 1 p.m. in the first round of the NCAA tournament at McAlister Field. It will be the first-ever NCAA event hosted there.

Racial slurs are thrown at the student body president. Systematic inequality comes back into focus on campus. Student groups propose resolutions to help tackle this deeply ingrained problem. The response from the University president, who appears flustered when physically confronted by protestors and seems more concerned with the traditions and fundraising efforts of the institution, is slow and weak.
Sounds like the University of Missouri? Well, I was thinking of a school about 1,500 miles west.
While Mizzou was dominating the headlines with the resignation of its president amidst racism issues at the school, our own Undergraduate Student Government voted on a resolution to address the campus climate toward racial minorities.
The news out of Columbia shocked me. Plenty of colleges have protested discrimination recently. Athletes had taken protests to social media before. Portions or entireties of professional sports seasons have been robbed by labor disputes and subsequent strikes. But never before has a group of student-athletes, along with its coaching staff, leveraged its influence in such an impactful way on a social issue.
What I found most striking from the news, though, were the similarities between the circumstances at Mizzou that sparked the protest and the recent racial controversy at USC. Of course, the situations are not identical. The history of oppression runs deeper on the Midwest than in the West Coast. The Columbia campus is not far from Ferguson, where race riots captured the nation’s attention last summer. The number of specific incidents of discrimination was greater at Mizzou, and the response from the administration was arguably worse.
But at the heart of both instances, we see a student leader personally attacked because of his or her race, proposals for university policy to combat campus racism and criticism over the response of school administrators. Yet the uproar at Mizzou over the instances seems a world away. The problem feels like it’s on another level there; I could never imagine something like that happening on our campus.
But it’s not that far of a stretch to say that something like that could happen at USC. The Mizzou Tigers have totally shifted the power balance in college sports, and with great power comes great responsibility
Personally, I’m still a bit surprised at how quickly things escalated at Mizzou. Yes, the incidents on campus were bad. Yes, the school could have done a better job addressing them. Yes, there’s probably some university administrator in the country better fit to handle those incidents than former university President Tim Wolfe was. But his resignation isn’t really an accomplishment for diversity in and of itself.
When the Mizzou student group for diversity met with Wolfe in October before the hunger strike, one of its demands on a list of eight proposed policy changes was the immediate resignation of Wolfe. It’s not surprising that this aggressive bargaining accomplished nothing. What is surprising is that the sticking point of the subsequent hunger strike was not any of the seven other resolutions, but the career of an individual. If I were thrown into the negotiation room with the Mizzou student group pushing for change, I can’t say that it would be a very trusting relationship, knowing that the group might come for my head before we had a chance to compromise.
There are obviously important issues regarding socioeconomic inequality in this country and around the world, and I’m inspired to see the impact students can have on these issues. But if there is a role that students, and especially student-athletes, can play in this discussion here, I think it’s foolish for us to look at it as a battle against the administration, or “the system.”
University administrations aren’t heartless bureaucracies with no concern for its students’ well being, even though most of their work revolves around financial stability of the institution. Sure, the fact that change only happened in Mizzou once a major source of revenue for the athletics department was threatened is proof that “money talks.” But that doesn’t mean Wolfe and the rest of the Mizzou administration are a bunch of corrupt, materialistic and selfish power mongers.
The reality is that even at an institution with millions of dollars in its endowment, resources are scarce. Whether it’s the number of faculty, the funding for certain programs or the time of administrators to deal with problems, all of these things represent some value because they don’t come in unlimited quantities. You can criticize an organization for putting too many resources here and not enough there, but you can’t criticize an organization for attempting to quantify the value of those resources with dollar signs. If the football team really did hold out and forfeit its game this weekend, not only would it have cost the community a beloved social event — which isn’t the most important thing in this issue, but still matters — but it also would have substantially reduced the ability of Mizzou’s athletics department to pay for the scholarships of its non-revenue generating student-athletes.
That being said, it’s now more obvious than ever how valuable efforts of football players are to the University. What precedent this sets in the future collective bargaining between athletes and universities is to be seen, but it certainly throws another wrench at the idea of amateurism in the NCAA.
So could the Trojan football team hold President Nikias hostage if he doesn’t implement the USG Campus Climate resolution? Yes, probably. If every player on the roster agreed not to play until the resolution would pass, at least some of the policies would go through before the scholarships of the entire roster were revoked. It would be fascinating; a whole new level of drama for a team that really, really doesn’t need any more story lines — which is why this is such a wild hypothetical. And it would be inspiring.
But I’m also skeptical of USG’s proposed resolution on campus diversity. I have no idea what the proposed vice president of diversity will do besides add one more administrator to the University’s payroll — and, ironically, USG is proposing a separate resolution on freezing tuition costs. One hundred million dollars to fund scholarships for underrepresented students sounds great, and George Lucas has already pledged $10 million to that cause at the School of Cinematic Arts, but for an organization with an annual budget of about $2 million, that’s asking a lot. The issue is important, and I don’t question the intention of USG leaders at all, but I think it only jumped to the top of the agenda once it started to personally affect our student leaders.
Ultimately, if USC tried that kind of a holdout, I don’t think it would really help achieve the ends of activists around the country. Yes, accessibility to education is a huge part of the structural inequality. But if serious systematic change will come to the opportunity in this country, it will probably come through much broader national policy, not through diversity training for a very small proportion of the population. How much money universities can and should devote to financial aid for low-income students is a significant issue, but it is beyond the expertise of any undergraduate. The arrival upon $100 million for the scholarship fund seems very arbitrary; I can’t think of any justification for why it wasn’t $75 million, or $150 million.
What we should take away from the Mizzou protest is that power only matters when it is unified. There certainly wasn’t much unity between the administration and the student body, but it was the unity across the football team that allowed it to leverage its power for change. That’s not to say everyone on the team was totally on board with the protest. At least one anonymous player said it wasn’t a unanimous effort. But when the support on the team reached a critical mass, and the leadership of the team in head coach Gary Pinkel got behind it as well, the team couldn’t be stopped. If it had been just five or 10 athletes refusing to participate in team practices, they would have lost their scholarships and we wouldn’t still be talking about it.
It will take unity among administrators for change to be substantial. The key to progress is empathy, or being able to feel what someone else feels and respects that other person. We must extend that same respect to the decision-makers across universities.
We are all young. We all started attending this university because we knew that the professors and administrators of the school had valuable expertise, that they had something to offer us, that we could learn something from them. We have a unique perspective to offer them in discussions about University policies, and we should take that responsibility seriously.
But we need to first acknowledge who all is on our team. Sports have an amazingly unique ability to unite school, communities and generations, and they must be used to do just that.

Just last week, I had the privilege of accepting my fifth unpaid internship. That’s a combination of five semesters or summers during which I have worked entirely voluntarily. I suppose I am officially a supporter and an advocate for the commonly despised unpaid internship.
It’s not that I have not had any opportunities to earn money working.  However, the unpaid opportunities I’ve been provided have outweighed — in my mind and for my career goals — the paid ones, and thankfully I have been privileged enough to follow my passions as opposed to the dollar.
I’m not angry about my unpaid internships. Rather, I chose the opportunities, and I cannot help but stay optimistic that all my hard work will eventually pay off into a paid job post-graduation.
The controversy of the unpaid internship is nothing new, especially in the entertainment industry. The case that sparked attention to the unpaid internship debate was the story of Eric Glatt, who worked as an unpaid intern on the film Black Swan.
According to The New York Times, the court ruled that Glatt and his fellow interns should have been classified as employees, citing a set of criteria released by the Department of Labor in 2010. These criteria indicate that in order for an internship to be unpaid the work must “be similar to training offered in a school setting.”
This case prompted a series of other interns to come forward with lawsuits, specifically against Sony, Warner Bros. and Viacom, according to The Hollywood Reporter. Present-day, these studios — and many others — have begun to pay interns for their work.
However, despite that it is well-appreciated that studios are paying their hard-working students, many other companies — especially smaller production or entertainment companies — still do not pay students. More so, the studio internships have become vastly more competitive and political in the hiring process because they are now paid, so snagging one of those internships is all the more difficult.
Unfortunately, unpaid internships are part of reality in some industries — the free-labor student initiative is regrettably a concept that’s here to stay. Rick Levy, partner and general counsel at ICM Partners, told The Hollywood Reporter that, “there is a long, long tradition of intern programs being an integral part of careers in Hollywood.” It sounds primal, but “paying your dues” is unfortunately just one part of the ever-growing and cutthroat business.
I, for one, have not once regretted my unpaid internships. Last summer, I worked at a wonderful production company called Beachside Films. Though I was unpaid, my supervisor included me on every aspect of what was going on, and I have never learned so much about the inner workings of a production company as I did simply being there and being included. After interning there, my knowledge far extended anything I could have learned in a classroom or from a teacher.
Even though unpaid internships aren’t disappearing from the debate anytime soon, there are ways that USC could make the agony of the unpaid internship less excruciating.
Claremont McKenna College has a “Sponsored Internship Program,” for example, which, according to the college’s website, “provides funding for summer internships in the U.S. and abroad.” Essentially, students apply to various competitive sponsored internship programs and submit proposals. Those selected receive stipends to support themselves during their internship or fellowship programs.
As a University encouraging and promoting internships for students, USC could offer more extensive sponsored internship programs. Opportunities more often exist in the political and nonprofit sectors; however, greater funding could go to encouraging students in the arts to pursue real-life learning experience. After all, while classwork is great, it is often experience that propels a student forward career-wise.
If any sort of school-related funding is too much to ask, the least schools and unpaid programs can do is team up against the awfulness of the requirement for school credit. Adding the stipulation of school credit sounds beneficial on the surface as it’s an excuse for justifying not paying, but in reality it’s more trouble than it’s worth.
It may be a radical idea, but there should be a way a student can get some sort of “credit” without paying thousands of dollars or jumping through extraneous hoops.
Evidently, unpaid internships are here to stay. It’s bad enough to be unpaid — let’s not make students actually pay to work when they’re willing to work for free.

This week, students at the University of Missouri successfully called for the president of the MU system, Tim Wolfe, to step down over his mishandling of racism on campus. Controversy and tensions had been brewing for months as students on campus protested, professors and classes walked out, a graduate student went on a hunger strike and dozens of football players suspended all football-related activities, including threatening to sit out the upcoming game against Brigham Young University, forcing the president to step down.
Students went beyond standard protests by threatening to withdraw from important university activities. The concrete action sent shockwaves through the community, drew massive media attention and threatened to hit the university where it hurts — in the pocketbook. The final straw was the threat of derailing the football program, which is highly lucrative for Mizzou. As The Atlantic pointed out, canceling the game against BYU would have cost Mizzou and associated businesses millions of dollars. The president had to step down to avoid costly financial losses.
But while the story of the protestors at Mizzou is ostensibly one of success, videos have emerged in the past few days that show activists restricting a reporter from taking pictures of the protest. Mizzou students exercised their First Amendment rights to free speech and peaceful assembly in ousting their president. It is deplorable that they would turn around and curtail the freedom of the press.
Mizzou succeeded where other universities have failed because students took action, rather than settling for extended dialogue on the issue. Carrots, sticks and sermons influence action. Students went beyond the sermons of demonstrations, videos, letters, discussions and articles which seem to have little impact on powerful university systems. In fact, Mizzou was so unaffected by student voices that the president pledged to address the issue at a later date and promised to announce a comprehensive plan in April 2016 — well after major sports ended on campus and so close to summer break that students would lose interest in the movement between semesters. Sermons were not working.
Seemingly, it was only the sticks that incited action. Players threatening to halt football operations, which are crucial at Mizzou and other universities, got the attention of the administration.
It is disheartening that only sticks worked in this situation and that sermons are failing in so many others. As these opinion pages have pointed out before, universities, including this one, seem to default to having “a discussion” or creating “a learning opportunity” about race and inclusivity on campus before pursuing concrete action. Universities want to build communal understanding and acceptance through education, rather than enforcing tolerance through punishment. Generally speaking, the former is better than the latter.
There is something to be said for endogenous acceptance — it is better to be accepted or celebrated for who you are because people appreciate other people, rather than being tolerated as different because a university will punish discrimination. But that is of little comfort to students being attacked for who they are. The sheer length of time required to change attitudes on campus means that harmful attitudes, words and actions would harm countless students on campus before the culture shifts. Culture shifts take time, but students in peril cannot wait.
It is also disheartening that student and faculty protesters would then turn on news media after succeeding. The ability of international news outlets to spread the story of the Mizzou protesters amplifies their voice and power on campus. Furthermore, news outlets have a right and responsibility to report on protests outdoors in public spaces, like the lawn at Mizzou. Finally, as the old adage goes, it is never a good idea to pick a fight with an organization that buys ink by the barrel. Targeting the media was a bad move, and it would be a shame if the Mizzou protests were mostly remembered for attempted First Amendment violations rather than the successes the protestors had on campus.
The students at Mizzou should be applauded and carefully exemplified. They showed that bravery, gumption and a willingness to act instead of merely speaking. Words are nice, but serious challenges demand committed action.
Why does this article sounds like a threat? These students/protesters simply didn’t want to be photographed for concern for their safety. And their concern was warranted. We’ve seen the videos of the guys threatening the minority students on campus. We’ve seen the accounts of the death threats. The media seems only worried about sensationalizing stories. The people involved have to worry about their safely after your journalists upload their names, faces, etc to the Internet for all the world to see. Yes. We want to know what’s happening. However, if the person doesn’t want to be photographed/videotaped, respect that and describe your story with words. That’s part of your job.

Last night, the Undergraduate Student Government Senate passed the Campus Climate Resolution by a resounding 11-1 margin. All the senators except Commuter Sen. Jacob Ellenhorn, who is also the president of the USC College Republicans, voted in favor of the resolution. The passage of the resolution is a good first step, but we must fight on to ensure diversity and equality at this school.
It was, however, discouraging to watch the Senate to debate this issue further. To be fair, responsible governance requires debating issues on the floor, but the senators and the authors of the resolution have met in the weeks leading up to this resolution and discussed the exact points senators like Sen. Giuseppe Robalino brought up tonight. Robalino’s rehash of issues resolved behind closed doors is not constructive and shows a divide in the student body that could discourage the University from acting quickly on the issue.
In the end, the passage of this resolution is undeniably valuable. It signals to the administration that the elected undergraduate student body is united behind the measure to create a better campus. This is a powerful voice, albeit less powerful after the Senate delayed the vote two weeks. That voice joins the resounding and immediate support for the measure from the Faculty Senate and the Graduate Student Government Senate.
However, the fight continues. Inclusivity and acceptance will not improve overnight because this resolution has cleared the USG Senate. In fact, many of the provisions in the resolution passed tonight will influence the culture of USC over the long term. In the short term, students must still rely on overworked administrators, understaffed resource centers and lackluster disciplinary policies to address discrimination on campus. Changing the climate of this campus will require both short-term enforcement to stop common harms and long-term cultural shift to create endogenous acceptance rather than enforced, exogenous tolerance. It is better to be accepted and celebrated for who you are than tolerated because the system says you must be.
This task now falls to the USC administration. For all the talk, infighting and writings about the USG Senate, the real power on campus lies with the administration. The best USG can do is pass non-binding resolutions; President C. L. Max Nikias, his administration and the Board of Trustees control the $4 billion annual budget and associated programming. The administration must realize that fixing this problem on campus will require short-term and long-term solutions.
The University’s record on change so far is mixed. On one hand, as Vice President of Student Affairs Ainsley Carry announced at the Voices of USC diversity forum, there was a drastic increase in reports of discrimination immediately after the verbal assault on USG President Rini Sampath. Increased reporting is good, especially since these were reports of incidents that already happened but went unreported, instead of new attacks that became reported as they happened. Furthermore, the University immediately reached out to Sampath and encouraged her to report the assault and allow the University to begin an investigation.
On the other hand, current University policy suggests that students need to report an incident directly before the University empowers the Title IX office to investigate. Campus investigators should be given the latitude to investigate without an official report, as reporting an attack can be intimidating and harmful to students already suffering from discrimination. This would demonstrate that the University is willing to take the steps necessary to protect students without requiring students to advocate on their own behalf. Furthermore, the University seems to have ignored these growing problems. The immediate response of the University after the incident with Sampath this fall was to send a letter stating, in effect, that USC does not have a diversity problem because we have one of the highest proportions of international students for any American university. Carry also revealed in an interview with ATVN that he has had numerous conversations with black men, student-athletes and international students on campus, who have all spoken with him about discrimination. Of course, there have been protests and news stories concerning diversity and inclusivity on this campus for years. It is deplorable that the University has taken this long to address such a fundamental issue.
A main concern is that there will be no real change coming out of this effort. Every year, Trojans talk this issue to death. Every year, nothing happens. When will the administration take a stand and make change a reality?
Soon it will be Thanksgiving break, then finals after that, winter break and possibly months before the University addresses the issue. Protest movements have gripped this campus before, from the USChange Movement to I, Too, Am USC, only to fizzle during gaps between the semesters. It will be important for the USC administration to carefully consider the issue at hand, but students should not let the University delay in hopes of killing the movement. With all the information — from talks between administrators and students, to protests, to town hall meetings, to articles in campus media, to social media posts — only an administration living under a rock could be unaware of the problems at USC. Administration, do not delay. Students, do not let them.
Students at Mizzou showed the world this week that students can create change when they do not give up and do not give in. Finding the right levers to pull on campus, namely threatening to derail football operations, worked at Mizzou. USC students need to find a similarly important issues on this campus that will force the administration to make a change.
Change needs to come to this campus. It will take the collective and continued efforts of all of us. Until all members of the Trojan family are appreciated, valued and loved for who they are, the fight is not over.
$100 million without raising tuition. So hopefully there will be a number of affluent alumni who whole-heartedly support this.

With Thanksgiving break two weeks away, the motivation to work decreases day by day. As we try to push through the last wave of midterms and various applications, there is a constant tethering between where we are and where we want to be. For some, just getting through the day is enough, but for others, there is an increasing pressure to work until presented with an award for a certain amount of effort. In a culture where there is an emphasis on working until retirement, there is a subconscious process within us that translates success to beating out the competition. Whether this competition is a single person or a group of applicants, the end goal becomes more about proving something to others than ourselves. We depreciate our single accomplishments to pay attention to others who appear to have their lives together, filing them in our mental “#goals” folder. Fortunately, there are ways to place ourselves within this folder and begin to see how impactful completing daily tasks can be.
Stress and time management play a major role in productivity but an underrated skill is
goal-setting. Like success, a goal is usually understood to be
long-term and effective on a large scale, but even small goals can be milestones. Creating something as simple as a to-do list can not only enhance organization but can also provide a sense of satisfaction in knowing something was accomplished that day, no matter how big or how small. The best way to go about this is investing in a yearly planner or using a phone calendar to get organized.
Color-coding within the planner or setting different notification sounds on a phone can make planning more exciting; the variation of cues stimulates mental processing by catching one’s attention and establishes different levels of importance for each task as well. Maintaining a to-do list can be a goal itself for some of us, but apps have also been developed to help categorize life’s daily demands.
Two apps that help the professional and the student get their life together are Planner Plus and myHomework Student Planner. Both of these apps have options to organize duties daily or monthly and are also free. Planner Plus divides the work between events, tasks and notes with color-coding and offers a syncing option so one’s progress can be tracked on multiple devices. myHomework Student Planner keeps school work in order by labeling them according to priority, type and class, and also provides updates for upcoming and late assignments. The beauty of utilizing apps is that they save space, save paper and, most importantly, give users the ability to continue moving at their own pace.
Using a planner, digital or physical, can be self-motivating as it provides an opportunity to individualize the path to success. Understanding that short-term goals are stepping stones to
long-term goals is the first phase of this path. The best way to know if improvement is happening is by keeping track of checkpoints, which can be simplified to the little tasks within the daily routines we all experience. In turn, grasping the significance of completing everyday plans clues us into the subjectivity of what constitutes a successful life. From this, we can start to file our own accomplishments in the #goals folder and continue to raise the bar for ourselves. Regardless of whether a goal is motivated by a paycheck or simply the feeling of completion, it is important to develop a system that emphasizes personal progress over societal definitions of success.

Vital organ · Singer-songwriter-organist Anna von Hausswolff plays the Acusticum Pipe Organ for her newest album, The Miraculous. The singer has been known to mix music genres, drawing influences from death metal. Later this year, she will embark on a tour thorughout the United States and Europe. – Photo courtesy of Other Music Recordings Co.
Whoever said classical music was boring has obviously never heard of Swedish singer-songwriter-organist Anna von Hausswolff. With so many titles attached to her name, von Hausswolff has attracted the attention of fellow female musicians, including singers Lykke Li and Kate Bush. Now, with her third album, von Hausswolff emerges into the mainstream eye. As someone who broke barriers in the instrumental world with her previous two albums, von Hausswolff returns Nov. 13 with The Miraculous, which promises to feature more of her unique musical acumen.
Part of what sets von Hausswolff apart is her employment of the Acusticum Pipe Organ in Pitea, Northern Sweden. The largest of its kind in Scandinavia, the instrument combines glockenspiel, percussion, celeste and vibraphone elements. On top of this, Hausswolff’s new album demonstrates her ability to marry traditional and out-of-fashion sounds.
The first song, “Discovery,” is reminiscent of Hans Zimmer’s direction from the Inception soundtrack. A heavy bassline introduces the track before launching into an ethereal melody, in which von Hausswolff expertly shifts between minor chords and runs. “Pomperipossa” not only highlights more of von Hausswolff’s strengths but also ties in current electronic music trends. In a fashion similar to Grimes, von Hausswolff shows that she will not be overpowered by the heavy background music. Of course, the star of the album is “Come Wander With Me/Deliverance,” a return to von Hausswolff’s black metal, Black Sabbath undertones found in 2013’s Ceremony. In this song, Hausswolff exemplifies her vocal range. Listeners will find the gothic anthem mirroring tracks from the Cocteau Twins.
However, other songs such as “An oath” and the title track “The Miraculous” fall flat. “An oath” deviates from the overall theme of the album. In an otherwise melancholic set, “An ath” tries to be catchy with its percussive backdrop. Additionally, with lyrics such as “That all will be there for you / Nothing is lost,” von Hausswolff detracts from the profundity of the rest of the songs. Additionally, one would assume that the title track would be the dominant force of The Miraculous, but the song relies too heavily on instrumentals. Though still a beautiful piece, “The Miraculous” fades into the rest of the album as it produces nothing striking.
Nevertheless, von Hausswolff proves she is no longer just an underground European music sensation. With her unique spin on sound, it is clear von Hausswolff is not here to please the masses, but rather to experiment with different layers of music. Ultimately, The Miraculous is deserving of all the critical attention it has been receiving so far.

I can’t lie to you — I don’t get people who are beach people. The heat gets to your head, the sand gets places you don’t want sand, and the sun doesn’t respect sun block’s boundaries. But I do have a soft spot for music that gets you into the mood for going to the beach. It might be a bit late in the year for legitimate trips, but use this playlist to hype you up for when it’s a bit warmer, or put on a jacket and get ready for some Best Coast.
