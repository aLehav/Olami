For Shaderica Lewis, a freshman studying electrical engineering, a curious click on the Transit financial wellness program while skimming the USC online safety and wellness courses last August paid off — quite literally.

“I knew that there were different types of loans, but I didn’t know you could push paying it back, or that you could not even have to pay it back at all,” she said. “Like if you joined the military, you don’t have to pay as much back.”
Transit was brought to USC through a new partnership between the USC Office for Wellness and Health Promotion and the USC Credit Union with Everfi, the same platform through which USC students access AlcoholEdu. Launched officially last semester, the two-part online educational course teaches students about student loans, credit, paying off debt and financial decision-making. It’s part of a growing effort to support students against the student debt crisis by providing support for financial wellness, the OWHP website said.
“We understand the stress that can come from financial concerns or feeling uncertain or unfamiliar with finances and how that can lead to stress and anxiety for students,” said Amanda Vanni, a health promotion specialist in the OWHP. 
She emphasized how the partnership between the OWHP and the Credit Union is the perfect marriage for a program like Transit to help students make sense not only of student loans and debt, but also their day-to-day budgets.
“We have to think of finances as more than just loans and financial aid,” Vanni said. “On a day-to-day basis, you’re having to make decisions, you know, are you going to go to Starbucks or not? Is that in your budget? Can you afford to buy X, Y and Z? Students coming into college might not have had to work with budgeting before.”
Everfi offers a multitude of different online wellness educational courses for K-12, undergraduate and graduate students. Transit was specifically created to help students whose financial concerns jeopardize their ability to graduate. 
According to an information sheet linked on the Everfi Transit page, 75 percent of college students have credit card debt and accumulate an average debt of $25,000 over six years in school. An overwhelming majority of students are worried about debt, and as funding declines, universities are looking for ways to support students when financial worries are on the rise. 
“The first semester [was] pretty successful,” said Eurie Im, a training manager for the USC Credit Union, on Transit’s first semester trial at USC. “We had 5,706 students complete it, and that was only incoming freshmen and transfers, so we hope to increase the participation rate with all other students. Our goal is to help students manage their student loan debt, to budget better, to learn about credit cards and to be successful in their financial lives.”
The USC Credit Union currently serves about 8,000 students, and according to their chief marketing officer, Tere Denison, ensures financial wellness for students is one of their major goals, and Transit is one of the programs that helps them achieve it. 
“The students are the beginning, the middle and the end for us,” Denison said. “[They] are the foundation for a lot of what we do and what we aim to do.”

The retired Marine Corps major general has a long history with space travel and exploration, commanding and piloting four missions to space before becoming NASA’s administrator. Bolden said he looks forward to coming back to USC, praising the University for its convergence of scientists, engineers, and medical researchers. 
“It feels great to come back to USC,” Bolden said in a USC news release. “I’m excited about the opportunity to continue my work with this great institution and its many talented faculty members, students and researchers.”
Bolden also praised USC’s focus on veteran education and other programs the University has launched over the past decade. 
“USC is providing veterans with the tools they need to become productive and successful members of the community,” he said in the news release. 
Bolden was inducted into the U.S. Astronaut Hall of Fame in 2006 and the National Aviation Hall of Fame in 2017. For his military service and NASA career, he received the Distinguished Flying Cross, the NASA Outstanding Leadership Medal and the Defense Superior Service Medal. He also received the Asa V. Call Award, the top USC alumni honor, in 2003.
President C. L. Max Nikias said in the USC news release that Bolden is a courageous leader with a wealth of knowledge and experience, both of which will be a great asset to the University. 
“We are thrilled to welcome him back to our board,” Nikias said.

Within the Keck Medicine of USC’s three hospitals, thousands of health workers walk through its pristine corridors, providing care for hundreds of patients at every hour of every day.

Following the national tragedies of the past year — from mass shootings and natural disasters to the latest flu epidemic — efficient care and service for patients have become increasingly crucial to the hospitals’ missions. 
But the solution to better care at hospitals also lies in caring for the caregivers of patients, said Jessica Thomas, the clinical director of the emergency department at USC Verdugo Hills Hospital.
“[In] my experience as an intensive care unit nurse, I’ve seen multiple instances where we’re giving care when it’s really medically futile,” said Thomas, who was a nurse for 15 years. “It’s that cumulative effect of dealing with trauma and tragedy over and over again — that’s what you do for a living — it chips away at your own sense of hope and sense of purpose.”
Thomas referenced her experience in an intensive care unit when a long-term patient died, a situation that devastated the nurses on the case.
In 2014, Thomas pitched the idea of developing the Code Lavender program at Keck Medical Center, a program designed to alleviate the stress and trauma health workers accumulate in their daily lives. 
After launching a pilot to integrate the program into the hospital’s administrative structure, Code Lavender was implemented and adapted into all three of USC’s hospitals by 2015, said Char Ryan, Keck’s chief patient experience and employee engagement officer. 
“This program … was really to address the emotional needs of our caregivers,” Ryan said. “Lots of times, [Code Lavender] is called for teams, particularly when people pass.” 
The concepts of mental health awareness and self-care have become more popular in the past five years, Ryan said, and the program was developed to embody this shift. Code Lavender provides emotional and physical resources to workers within 24 hours after the code is requested via email. 
Rev. Phil Manly, a Keck hospital chaplain and director of spiritual care, is one of the first Code Lavender responders; a social worker or chaplain is usually sent to the unit where the code is called. 
They bring with them a basket of lavender goods, from hand lotion and tea bags to inspirational cards, that help calm down and de-stress the individual.
“Every Code Lavender is different,” Manly said. “Our goal in these situations is to be consoling, sometimes we pray … We do a lot of listening and we try to diffuse whatever situation they’ve been through.” 
As chaplain, Manly is a firsthand witness to  the positive effects of Code Lavender on workers. He works alongside them to spiritually aid patients during their stay at the hospital.
“Just recently, we had on one of our ICU units, three guests in a 36-hour period,” he said. “It just wiped out our staff, but when we met with them and just listened to them and got to know them a little better, the next day, the smiles were back on their faces.”
The conversation within the health care industry has steadily evolved to involve caregivers, in addition to patients, as emphasis on work-life balance became heavier, Thomas said. 
“The literature in health care is [now] talking more about the concept of compassion fatigue and burnout in caregivers,” Thomas said. “Because we need our caregivers now more than ever, I think the tide is turning in terms of recognizing and implementing wellness programs, employee assistance programs [and] counseling.” 
The Keck hospitals have also worked to implement workshops and training around concepts of compassion fatigue, moral disengagement and self-care. Conditions like moral disengagement can occur in workers who feel overwhelmed and begin to mentally or emotionally disengage from their jobs, Ryan said.
Thomas and Ryan both envision Code Lavender to be a constant support resource, beyond simply a response in times of need. 
At Verdugo Hills Hospital, workers can participate in Zumba classes on Thursdays and the Keck hospitals also offer arts and crafts services for staff members. 
As Code Lavender enters its third year, Thomas highlighted the need for colleague care, self-care and empathy, beyond the hospital’s clear focus on the patient experience.

On Tuesday, students and alumni from the Norman Topping Student Aid Fund penned a response to Provost Michael Quick’s Monday memo regarding the fund.
After Provost Michael Quick sent a memorandum to Topping scholars to explain recent changes to the Fund’s program structure, Topping students and alumni responded in a letter. Daniel Zhu | Daily Trojan
Quick’s memorandum posed questions about the fund, backing his efforts to expand the program. The scholars’ letter to the Provost responded to Quick’s four main issues with the Topping Fund. 
The Topping letter said that the questions Quick mentioned in his memo were never discussed directly with Topping Fund administrators before Christina Yokoyama’s removal as Topping director on Feb. 1. 
“This is the first mention of a review [of the Topping Fund] and definitely the first time these questions have been posed outside of Senior Administration,” the letter stated. “The tainted USC medical school deans were treated with more respect despite their embarrassing drug and sex scandals, both of them.”
The Provost’s office declined to comment after the scholars’ response was released.
Quick’s main concern in the memo was that “over the last few years, an average of more than a third of available dollars for the Fund were not used at all.”
In response to Quick, the scholars referred to the Governing Board guidelines that required any remaining funds to be reinvested into the endowment at the end of each year. Emergency funds for the past two years have been set aside for students who may not receive the necessary support from the University.
Quick also stated that it did “not seem equitable” that only 115 students out of 7,200 undergraduate and 9,600 graduate students are selected as scholars.
In response, the scholars explained that the Topping Fund is more than just a scholarship. 
“The NTSAF is a retention program, supporting and guiding scholars in their successful navigation,” the response stated. It also explained that after Yokoyama’s first year as Topping director, the number of scholars increased from 88 to 108.
The letter also mentioned a “hiring freeze” on the Topping Fund, which was led by the University. In Spring 2010, an office manager position was created and filled to provide the necessary support for expansion, but when the position became vacant in August 2014, it was never refilled.
“The NTSAF still awaits approval to fill a position that it is fully able to fund,” the letter stated. “Again, the NTSAF has been understaffed since 2014 although fully able to fund the position.”
Since 2011, Yokoyama had submitted several proposals that expressed the desire to expand the program and increase the number of scholars, according to the letter. 
The letter included an excerpt of one of Yokoyama’s proposals from December 2014, which described immediate goals to support an expansion. The goals included an increase from three to four full-time staffers and bringing the number of scholars from 108 to 135.
Such memos asked for an increase in staffing to administer an expanded program; however, the letter stated that the proposals would “go unanswered or given the usual ‘hiring freeze’ response.”
The scholars closed their letter with a list of program goals, which included maintaining the original spirit of the Topping Fund, as well as keeping the integrity of the Governing Board as primarily student-run.
“Let us remind you that it is WE who have been asking YOU to allow more scholars,” the letter to Quick stated. “We have requested an expansion for many years. YOU should have done better long ago by not pretending to listen when we spoke directly to you in 2013 and ignoring us in our requests to your vice provosts over the years … We deserved to be part of the conversation well before this shocking decision [of Yokoyama’s removal] ever took place.”

A Metro train on the Expo line struck two non-USC individuals on bicycles Tuesday night at Jefferson Boulevard and Flower Street, according to the Los Angeles Police Department Southwest Division and the USC Department of Public Safety.
No information was available at the time of publication about the conditions of the victims.
Service on the Expo line was interrupted following the crash between the Jefferson/USC station and the 23rd Street station, according to L.A. Metro, but a bus-shuttle service was set up to transport passengers between the stations during the interruption. The Expo line was reopened just after midnight.
Traffic on Jefferson Boulevard between Hope Street and Figueroa Street was also halted following the accident.
Teresa Juarez, a South Los Angeles resident, said she and her husband came across one of the victims on scene and called 911.
“I didn’t know there was a gentleman on the other side,” Juarez said. “So once we called 911, within a few minutes the paramedics were here and they realized there was another gentleman off on the side and I guess he was worse off, I don’t know, I didn’t see him.”

Undergraduate Student Government elections will be underway in less than a week, but the mood around campus doesn’t reflect that. Yes, there are campaign signs along Trousdale Parkway, candidates make Facebook pages to gather support and campus news organizations write about the campaign trail. But for the average student, the air of USG elections just isn’t there. It’s hard to argue that USC is a politically passionate campus, when, in fact, it may be notorious for caring more about frat parties than political parties.
Several student government systems in other colleges across the country run their elections by grouping candidates together to form campus-wide political parties. There are those who propose that USC do the same. But such a system is not needed here. Our campaign system is not broken. So, as the saying goes, “if it ain’t broke, don’t fix it.”
President George Washington, in his famed farewell address, notoriously argued against the formation of political parties for the United States. Washington feared such factions would undermine the concept of popular sovereignty in the United States. Clearly, we did not listen.
Shideh Ghandeharizadeh | Daily Trojan
Before countering the need for USG political parties, it is important to understand the reasons some schools have them. The first is to generate compromise. While compromise is generally something we strive for, it implies that we have a cluster of voices fighting to be heard. Unfortunately for USC (and fortunately for USG candidates), this is not the case. We have two presidential tickets competing in this year’s campaign, along with 15 senators running for 12 slots.
Given that the competition is relatively low, there’s no need to consolidate the already-few voices into a party system.
USG rules already allow for senate candidates to run on joint platforms if they so choose, and the president is allowed to select a vice president to share tickets with. Of course, it would be wrong to prohibit candidates from forming groups on their own, but formally declaring party names and seeking party endorsements from groups around campus would overcomplicate the election process.
The argument that grouping candidates together will generate more interest in USG ignores how our system isn’t broken — our voters are. USG needs to find a way to excite students about elections, to publicize what USG can do for the average student. That’s a task they are struggling with, but in due time they very well may find a solution.
I am confident, however, that the leadership knows forming parties would have the opposite effect. It would complicate an election process that needs to generate more participation.
Allowing candidates to make their own political parties would also encourage straight-ticket voting: voting for all candidates of a particular party without listening to the candidates themselves. Again, this is the opposite of what USG needs; it needs more student engagement, not less.
Schools that run on a party-based election system discourage outsiders and independents to run for office. In contrast, USG elections are open to all, with no allegiances barring newcomers from taking a shot at holding office. In fact, none of the current senate candidates have held USG office before. This would not be possible in a party-run electoral setting.
To be clear, this column does not condemn political parties in American politics. These mediating institutions are necessary to group like-minded people for more comprehensible platforms and to make candidates’ views easily available to voters. But such groups are simply not needed for the number of candidates and constituents at USC.

It’s that time of year. The smiling faces of Undergraduate Student Government presidential and senatorial candidates line Trousdale Parkway, Annenberg Media hosts candidate “town hall” events and swaths of friends change their Facebook profile pictures to the business casual-meets-school spirit promotional filters of USG candidates.
Yet, despite its efforts, the intractable problem of USG at USC persists: many students don’t know much about what USG does or what it can do for them. Those who do vote often do so because they personally know someone running for USG or have attended a free food event hosted by USG. And when candidates repeat the same buzzwords — “diversity,” “campus safety” and “sustainability” — it’s easy to see why so many who are engaged are left wondering what exactly differentiates the candidates.
Yet, with its $2.3 million budget and six executive branches, USG, in the right hands, can be a force for transformative change on campus. So it’s important for us to not only choose our student leaders wisely, but also see how the system could be better. Maybe it’s time we took a page out of the playbook of our California university counterparts, like UCLA and UC Berkeley, which have long used political parties as the backbone of their student governments.
The most important impact that political parties could have at USC is to create a pipeline for student activism and engagement. At USC, a slew of institutional factors — chief among them, student demography and administrative lack of transparency — has created an environment of political apathy regarding campus issues. Instead of working on the many campus issues that affect us personally — sexual assault, sustainability, diversity and inclusion and cultural communities — so many politically-minded students take their talents to work for local politicians or organizations. And that makes the work all the more difficult for those who do spend their energy advocating on behalf of students’ rights on campus. 
Shideh Ghandeharizadeh | Daily Trojan
That’s not to say that campus activism at USC is impossible. A racially charged incident aimed at former USG president Rini Sampath yielded a year of diversity initiatives in 2015; now, students are fighting to save an administrative position that the University removed from the Norman Topping Student Aid Fund, which financially supports first-generation students. But the issue is that campus activism isn’t sustainable; Vice President of Student Affairs Ainsley Carry even said last year that he remembered the days when students were “banging down” his door wanting to talk about sexual assault. 
Building political parties would create an intergenerational pipeline for student leaders, and it would generate more conversation about who we are and what we stand for. This can only yield positive results.
Greater student engagement with USG, in turn, also informs an electorate; when it comes to elections, political parties serve as indicators of voters of candidates’ values. The organization of policies and platforms, instead of individual candidates running on abstract ideas, creates real accountability. A quick look at political analysis in UC Berkeley’s The Daily Californian, for example, shows that campus political parties engender the same kind of community-driven decisionmaking that we expect from our local, state and national governments.
Critics might wonder whether creating political parties at USC might stifle candidates who would rather identify as independent. Theoretically, it could, but political parties at other schools show that this doesn’t have to be the case. For example, a commentator in UCLA’s The Quad revealed that in the 2017 Undergraduate Students Association election, “a string of passionate independents took on the establishment — and came out on top.” 
It’s clear that it’s time to take a hard look at the fundamentals of what drives students to make their campus and community better. And if institutional factors have been holding student engagement back, then let’s fix the institution. We, the students, pay into and vote for our student government, so let’s make sure it’s the best it can be.

Bovard Auditorium was filled to capacity with music lovers and neuroscience enthusiasts Monday night — including many who were passionate about both. The Music as Medicine event was hosted by USC Visions and Voices, the Los Angeles Opera and USC Dana and David Dornsife’s Brain and Creativity Institute, as part of the Provost’s Series on Wicked Problems, which grapples with how universities can tackle issues such as poverty, disease and cyber security. On this night, the focus was on how music can help manage pain as a form of medicine, featuring a conversation about the connection between music and the brain.

To start the evening, four L.A. Opera vocalists of various ranges performed short pieces accompanied by one of L.A. Opera’s pianists. The performances were followed by a brief conversation with guests Renée Fleming and Antonio Damasio. 
Fleming is a world renowned vocalist who specializes in opera, and has won multiple Grammys for Best Classical Vocal Performance and Vocal Solo. Additionally, she was awarded the 2011 Fulbright Lifetime Achievement Medal, the 2012 National Medal of the Arts and an honorary doctorate from the Eastman School of Music. She became interested in the science behind her profession several years ago, and since then has become a dedicated scientist — involved in studies such as singing while receiving an MRI so researchers could monitor which parts of the brain were active. 
After Fleming’s presentation, there was a “musical interlude” where L.A. Opera’s pianist returned to the stage and played Chopin’s “Nocturne no. 9” while the audience observed parts of the brain reacting to the piece on a screen. 
Damasio, the founder of Brain and Creativity Institute and USC Dornsife’s own professor of Neuroscience, Psychology and Philosophy, continued the conversation by covering his research at USC, where he and his wife Hanna Damasio have made advances to the study of neuroscience. One of their many successes involved experimental neuroanatomy and the idea that the mind functions in conjunction with the body, not separately. 
When Damasio was asked how he became interested in music by moderator Christopher Koelsch, CEO of L.A. Opera, Damasio said, “I grew up with it, there was never really a time where I was not involved in it.”
Damasio has published multiple books: Looking for Spinoza: Joy, Sorrow, and the Feeling Brain, and Descartes’ Error: Emotion, Reason, and the Human Brain and most recently, The Strange Order of Things: Life, Feeling, and the Making of Cultures. 
Toward the end of the event, Assal Habibi, USC assistant professor of research psychology, took the stage and detailed an ongoing research project led by the Brain and Creativity Institute. This study began over five years ago with young children in the Los Angeles community who were separated into three groups: one involved in an after school music program, one involved in after-school soccer, and one involved in neither activity. The researchers tracked the progress of these children annually with a variety of assessments, testing everything from memory to impulse control. The results showed that the children who were involved in the music program improved in math and reading, and had greater impulse control, pitch discrimination, attention and working memory relative to their peers. 
A video shown by Fleming, the movie trailer for “Music Got Me Here,” showed the progress a young man, Forrest, made after a snowboarding accident caused severe trauma to his brain. He was not able to speak for nearly two years, but through extensive music therapy, he not only survived, but was able to both speak and sing again.
It was an enlightening evening for music lovers, showing how your favorite songs have the potential to do more than just please the ears. 
The next event in the Provost’s “Wicked Problems” Series, in which a USC faculty team will lead a conversation on how to improve average lifespan in an urban environment, will take place on April 17.

In the heart of Koreatown is an eye-catching wall overrun with pseudo-ivy vines. The adjacent wooden interior beckons customers into the newly opened California Ramen Factory. Its  quirky logo and the use of bold block lettering on the outside wall also draws in customers with an appetite for the house specialty: ramen. 
California Ramen Factory opened in January and has already received a decent amount of traffic thanks to their opening week buy-one-get-one-free promotion and the sheer volume of positive Yelp reviews. Their menu consists of ramen, rolls and nori tacos as well as appetizers that include takoyaki, ika geso, beef gyoza and chicken karage. Soon to come are poke burritos and bowls.
Inside, the interior pairing of yellow and medium-brown wood is slightly garish. There are two long, communal tables running through the center of the restaurant, as well as a row of booths that seat two to four people. Looking out a window over West 3rd street is a long counter with bar-like seating, where patrons can observe passersby while slurping hot ramen. 
The new California Ramen Factory has garnered significant buzz since opening in January, but lacks the flavor to back it up. Photo from Yelp.
Upon entering the restaurant, guests are directed to a kiosk on the left, where they can electronically place their orders. They can then choose their own seating and wait for the food arrive from a team of friendly waiters. 
While there are only five types of ramen on their menu ranging from $11 to $13, the vast variety of toppings provide diverse flavor options. Customers have the option to add pork, chicken, a soft boiled egg, nori, grated garlic, wood ear mushroom, green onion, crispy onion or corn. Two menu items include the green ramen, made from a pesto broth, and the vegan ramen, comprising noodles made from kale. 
When it comes to ramen, broth and meat are the two most important components. In its signature tonkatsu ramen, California Ramen Factory delivers on the broth. It is thicker than one would expect, and a bowl of broth alone can satisfy the appetite. While it is a bit on the blander side, there are various sauces and oils that are on the table or are available upon request to improve the flavor. However, their meat is rather subpar, as the cut is poorly angled in most cases, and the pork itself lacks flavor.  In terms of meat preparation, the black ramen has an advantage over the signature tonkatsu — because it is served with black garlic oil, the meat better retains its moisture and flavor. 
They do not have dessert on their menu, but a few blocks down are California Donuts, open 24/7,  and Continental Bakery, where one can get their sugar fix. 
Overall, California Ramen Factory is quite average in price, flavor and ambience for a Koreatown ramen shop. However, a large part of their menu is still to come, which will hopefully give the restaurant a much-needed boost.

Catherine Yang | Daily Trojan
I’ve always been obsessed with female dissidents. In the annals of literature and pop culture, these women were my heroines — Joan of Arc, Jo March, Anna Karenina, Mulan, Offred. I consumed their stories with fervor, roused by their refusal to be demure and submissive, inspired by the fights they waged against the norms of their respective time periods. 
In 1985, a real-life stirring of feminist rage was brewing in the American art world, armed with wheat paste and posters. A troupe of anonymous women donning gorilla masks took the streets in true literary heroine fashion, and took matters into their own hands. In many ways, they are the precursors of the modern day #MeToo and Time’s Up movements — they called out those in power, publicly embarrassed their oppressors and, above all, they actually worked. 
The Guerrilla Girls, as they called themselves, became unlikely vigilantes and social justice warriors for their unorthodox tactics wherever discrimination lurked. In their prime, they were self-branded as an exclusive, glamorous girls’ club and developed a cult-like following of artists, feminists and activists. Though they were originally formed to combat the top-down discrimination from white men who dominated the art world, they have also been instrumental in bringing about progress in representation in Hollywood and same-sex marriage through their assertive, in-your-face artwork. The Guerrilla Girls produced posters, billboards, performances, protests, installations and prints bearing names, statistics and scandalous images that shocked the public into action and awareness. 
One of their most famous billboards depicts a nude woman clad in a gorilla mask gazing confrontationally over her shoulder. In bold print, the piece begs the query, “Do women have to be naked to get into the Met. Museum?” and cites the fact that “Less than 5 percent of the artists in the Modern Art Section are women, but 85 percent of the nudes are female.” One of my personal favorite Guerrilla Girl works is a satirical list of the advantages of being a female artist, including “working without the pressure of success,” “not having to be in shows with men” and “not having to choke on those big cigars or paint in Italian suits.” 
With the perfect amalgam of humor, sass and social truth, Guerrilla Girls put feminism on display in the streets. When I look at one of their posters, I am instantly drawn in to read more closely and am left with a deep lingering sense of injustice. 
Art by Grace Cillo | Daily Trojan
Now, more than three decades later, the tectonic plates of gender hierarchy are shifting once again. Both within and outside of the art sphere, the Guerrilla Girls taught modern day feminists to be unapologetic and unafraid of waging war against an unjust system. In retrospect, the Guerrilla Girls were prescient in their causes, having taken aim long ago at such issues as gender inequality, racism and internalized biases that are once again at the forefront of the public conversation.
One glaring difference, however, is that the Guerrilla Girls were, and remain to this day, anonymous. Taking on monikers of female artist predecessors, such as Frida Khalo and Käthe Kollwitz, and never appearing publicly without wearing gorilla masks, the Girls sought to focus attention on the issues at hand rather than their own personalities and identities. In contrast, today’s movement has seen countless scores of women come forward with their own narratives and messages for their attackers and oppressors, far less daunted by the prospect of showing their faces and publicizing their names. Victims became survivors, who in turn became silence-breakers and symbols of empowerment. 
To me, this represents a significant leap forward in the increased sense of self-determination that grips the feminist community. What’s more, the Guerrilla Girls used humor and ostentation to get a reaction out of an ‘80s art world that was vastly indifferent to topics of feminism and diversity. Today, this tactic is not as necessary; the dissident conversation has not only spread out of the art sphere but also, women increasingly feel safe and strong enough to speak openly and honestly about their experiences, no longer hiding behind masks, nicknames or displays of irony. 
In many ways, their populist approach to art and dissent cast feminism in a fresh limelight by the late ‘80s — they made the intersection of female art and political activism seem not only acceptable, but also indispensable. 
They paved the way for similar groups and movements that have popped up throughout the decades, all the while remaining incognito puppet-masters. They changed the way I think critically about art and the way I perceive feminism today. 
The Guerrilla Girls set the stage, and now we’re standing on it, with the whole world watching.

Trojan Athletic Director Lynn Swann announced Tuesday that USC football head coach Clay Helton’s contract has been extended through the 2023 season.

“We have lofty goals at USC and Clay can get us to those goals,” Swann said. “He has shown that he can lead our team with integrity and stability and that he has the ability to win conference and national championships. Winning national championships is a process and Clay has built a championship foundation through consistently successful recruiting, hiring outstanding assistant coaches and providing a vision for our program.”
Helton joined the Trojan Family in 2010 as the quarterbacks coach, and has held several other positions in USC football since then, including passing game coach in 2012, offensive coordinator in 2013 and, most notably, head coach since 2016.
“Coaching at USC has been the most special opportunity of my life and I am so pleased to continue the journey toward championships here,” Helton said. “I would like to thank President Max Nikias, Athletic Director Lynn Swann and the USC administration for the tremendous opportunity that they have given to me and my staff.”
In his two-plus years as the head coach and interim head coach of USC football, he has helped build a successful program. Boasting a 27-10 overall record, Helton has led his squad to victory over nine AP Top 25 teams, tallied 21 wins in his first two full seasons — more than any other head coach in USC history — and holds an undefeated record at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum (16-0). He has also led the Men of Troy to two New Year’s Six bowl games — the Rose Bowl in 2017 and the Cotton Bowl this season.
He also has a number of awards to his name. Helton has been named a two-time Paul “Bear” Bryant National Coach of the Year Award finalist and 2017 AP Pac-12 Coach of the Year.
Helton has proven himself as a valuable leader for an increasingly dominant football program. Only time will tell what he has in store for the Trojans.

The USC baseball team starts the 2018 season after a 2017 season record of 21-34, including an 8-22 Pac-12 record that tied them with Arizona State at the bottom of the conference standings.
Junior infielder Lars Nootbaar returns as the Trojans’ offensive leader heading into the 2018 campaign. Katie Chin | Daily Trojan
Dan Hubbs enters his sixth year with a 137-145 mark as the Trojans’ head coach.
The Trojans were adequate at the plate last season, finishing sixth in the conference with a .273 team batting average and 33 home runs. They struggled to score, however, finishing with the fourth fewest runs in the Pac-12.
The loss of infielders Frankie Rios and Adalberto Carrillo, the team leaders in batting average and home runs respectively, hurts, but the lineup still has talent. Infielders Brandon Perez and Lars Nootbaar are back for their junior seasons as team leaders. Nootbaar led the team in slugging percentage a year ago at .510, while Perez finished second in batting average at .313.
USC was also average in the field. The team allowed 42 errors, good for third in the conference, but gave up the most stolen bases with 62. With a very different infield this season, Hubbs should focus on improving this discrepancy.
Pitching let the Trojans down in 2017, as the team had the worst earned run average in the Pac-12 at 5.56, and there’s reason to believe that the trend will continue. Seven of the 18 pitchers are freshmen, so the staff is inexperienced. This season, pitching will be led by sophomore Chris Clarke, a towering 6’7” right-hander who was the only starter with a winning record last season. Senior Mason Perryman, junior CJ Stubbs and redshirt juniors Brad Wegman and Mitch Hart will look to make strides with additional seasons under their belts.
USC has a number of intriguing newcomers as the 2017 recruiting class ranked 11th in the country and 2nd in the Pac-12 according to Perfect Game. Three incoming freshmen, pitchers Alex Cornwell and Kyle Hurt and infielder Ben Ramirez, were taken straight out of high school in last year’s professional draft.
Cornwell, a product of Maranatha High School in La Canada, Calif., was taken in the 37th round by the Chicago Cubs, according to Perfect Game. Hurt was drafted by the Philadelphia Phillies in the 34th round. Ramirez, a shortstop out of Chula Vista, was drafted by the Chicago Cubs in the 35th round. 
Cornwell and Hurt are joined by fellow freshman pitchers John Beller, Isaac Esqueda, Brian Gursky, Riley Lamb and Augie Sylk. Along with Ramirez, the incoming position players include outfielder Trevor Halsema, catcher Grant Parker and infielders Chase Bushor, Jamal O’Guinn and Bart West.
“I think it’s a great class,” Hubbs said. “It boasts pitchers from both the right and left sides who are high-level, proven winners over their high school careers. For the position players we have brought in big, athletic players who project to have power from both the right and left sides of the plate. We think this class ranks as one of the best classes we have brought in in five seasons.”
The Trojans open their season Feb. 16 when they kick off a three-game home stand against Utah Valley.

The USC men’s basketball team is coming off of a gut-wrenching 79-82 loss to crosstown rival UCLA this past weekend in Westwood. The defeat, which came down to the final possession of the game, snapped a six-game winning streak in Pac-12 play for USC, the longest conference winning streak in Trojan basketball history since 1992.

However, despite the loss, USC still finds itself sitting in second place in the Pac-12 regular season standings. The Trojans are one game behind conference-leading Arizona, who was upset by Washington last week.
 The Trojans are back in action this week, as they will make their way out to the desert to take on Arizona State on Thursday. USC will conclude its weekend road trip with a matchup against the Wildcats on Saturday.
 “Our last stretch of the season is going to be a tough one, filled with a lot of road games,” said USC senior guard Elijah Stewart, who scored 20 points in the loss to UCLA Saturday. “But we’re prepared to go in and get a few sweeps, steal a few games on the road.”
The Sun Devils will enter Thursday night’s contest coming off of an 88-78 victory against Washington State on the road. After opening the season on a 12-1 tear through non-conference play, ASU was ranked No. 3 nationally upon entering conference play on Dec. 30. 
The Sun Devils have tail-spun through Pac-12 competition thus far, as ASU has opened conference play with a 5-6 record. ASU’s conference struggles have dropped it out of the national rankings entirely.
 USC will be posed with the task of slowing down ASU’s primary offensive weapon, senior guard Tra Holder, on Thursday. Leading the Sun Devils in scoring with an average 19 PPG this season, maintaining Holder will be a point of emphasis for the Trojans defensively. Holder recorded 20 points (8-of-13 FG) in the Sun Devils’ win over Washington State last week. 
Fellow senior guard Shannon Evans II is also a scoring threat, especially beyond the arc. He averages a team second-most 16.8 points per game on .386 percent 3-point shooting. 
Freshman forward Romello White is the team’s primary weapon inside the paint  both offensively and defensively. He averages nearly a double-double per game (12.1 points, 7.7 rebounds). Most recently, he scored 21 points and hauled in nine rebounds against Washington State. 
White will be an interesting matchup for USC junior forward Chimezie Metu, who leads the Trojans with 41 blocks this year.
USC’s offensive leader all season long has been senior guard and team captain Jordan McLaughlin. The Pac-12’s current leader in assists (averaging 7.7 per game), McLaughlin is also second in the conference in steals (averaging 2 per game).
 McLaughlin’s efforts this season were recognized on Monday as he was named a finalist for the Bob Cousy Award, an honor that celebrates the top point guard in college basketball. From across the nation, McLaughlin was one of just 10 finalists for this award.
“[Being named a finalist] is an honor,” McLaughlin said. “It means that all of my work is showing, on the national level. It’s one thing to be nominated [for the award], but I want to win it.”
McLaughlin’s team will look to break what has been a historically brutal curse against Arizona teams on the road. USC has been swept in its last five consecutive Arizona road trips the team has taken. The last time USC swept its Arizona road trip against the Sun Devils and Wildcats was in 1985.
“There are two really tough teams out there in Arizona,” McLaughlin said. “We’ve just got to go out there and handle out business.”
The Trojans’ road trip finale with Arizona on Saturday is a contest that will be loaded with ramifications in the conference standings. The Pac-12 tournament, which will take place at the T-Mobile Arena in Las Vegas, Nev. from Mar. 7-10, is now only a month away.

On Sunday, Nick Foles and the Philadelphia Eagles upset Tom Brady and the New England Patriots. It was a glorious game for fans of offense, as the two teams set a record for most yards combined in a postseason game. Ultimately, Brady fumbled with two minutes left, Foles caught a touchdown pass and won MVP, and some awkward kid took a selfie with Justin Timberlake. In other words, it was one of the greatest Super Bowls of all time.
But I’m not here to talk about the game (just yet) — as wonderful and weird as it was. I’m here to talk about what comes afterward. The Super Bowl signifies the official end of football season, and the beginning of what my dad likes to call “the dark period.” For those of us uniquely obsessed with football above all other sports, these are always a challenging five months to endure. Some of us choose to occupy our time without football by finding new hobbies, like knitting or trying to get excited about the NBA regular season. Others choose to start getting work done (nah). There are many methods of dealing with the dreaded post-football hangover, but this year I am suggesting something specifically for USC fans.
It’s time to dive into the spring sports that the school has to offer. Too often, football overshadows every other sport at USC, and let’s be honest — it makes sense. Football is exciting, it generates a lot of money and the Trojans almost always put a compelling product out on the field (I didn’t say good). But USC also possesses numerous other world-class sports teams worthy of recognition and attention, especially in the spring. 
USC’s beach volleyball team has only existed since 2012, but the program has already won three national championships — all in the past three years. This season, head coach Anna Collier will carry out the difficult task of replacing four seniors, including two-time All-American Kelly Claes and team captain Sara Hughes (the duo now stars on the professional level together). 
The Trojans lost several stars who led the program since its inception, but now they begin a new, exciting era. Five freshmen join a defending national championship squad comprised of seven upperclassmen, creating a mix of both raw talent and experience. 
The beach volleyball team has already proven it belongs among the nation’s elite in a very short period of time. Now, Collier and her squad aim to show they have staying power too. Beach volleyball kicks off its season on Feb. 24 at Arizona State. 
The week before, another relatively new and successful team in women’s lacrosse begins its season. 
Women’s lacrosse has gone an impressive 38-5 over the past two years with an NCAA Tournament quarterfinal appearance in 2015. In 2018, they seek their first ever national title with key players such as sophomores Kerrigan Miller (36 goals in 2017) and Kaeli Huff (29 goals in 2017) returning. 
In addition to those two teams, both basketball programs are excelling at the right time as they head into conference tournament play. Men’s basketball lost a nailbiter to UCLA on Saturday, but they still look like a contender in the Pac-12, especially after their recent six-game winning streak. Looming games against Arizona and Arizona State along with a rematch against UCLA on March 3rd should all be wonderful viewing experiences, all while going a long way in determining their fate come March Madness. 
Meanwhile, the women’s team is experiencing a renaissance under new-old head coach Mark Trakh, who  previously coached USC from 2004-09. The Trojans are not an elite team yet, as evidenced by their last two consecutive losses to UCLA, but with a 15-8 record they’re vastly better than last year’s squad which finished last in the Pac-12. 
Add in a women’s water polo team that won a national title just two years ago and a baseball team featuring the prolific junior Lars Nootbaar (.313, 34 RBI in 2017), and this spring features an excellent crop of interesting teams. 
Football season may be over and many people like me will face months of withdrawal. But for USC fans there are many teams to get excited about. It’s time to give spring sports a chance. 
And now here are three things I enjoyed in sports this week, Super Bowl Edition. 
Nick Foles: 
Here were a few things I said about Nick Foles leading up to the Super Bowl: “There’s no way the Eagles win a Super Bowl with Nick Foles,” “Nick Foles is generally pretty bad at football” and “Nick Foles hasn’t played a good season of football since 2013.” Foles ended up shredding New England’s defense for 373 yards, three touchdown passes and one touchdown catch. Now, he’s not only a Super Bowl-winning quarterback and MVP, but he’s also about to get paid by some team as a starting quarterback. Sometimes, it feels great to be wrong.
Nelson Agholor: 
This Sunday, I decided to root for the Eagles for two main reasons: first, they were playing the Patriots, and second, I wanted to see Agholor, a former Trojan, shine on the biggest stage. He didn’t disappoint, catching seven passes for 84 yards and making numerous clutch plays down the stretch. He completed an excellent comeback season, after trade speculation in the off-season. Hopefully, he will be a weapon on the Eagles’ offense for years to come. 
Manning-Beckham commercial: 
This one isn’t related to the actual game, but Eli Manning and Odell Beckham Jr.’s Dirty Dancing imitation was the best commercial on Sunday (it was an admittedly dull year for ads). For the third time in his career, Manning ended up upstaging Brady in a Super Bowl.

The Mai & Brianna ticket (left) and the Debbie & Blake ticket (right) discussed diversity and inclusion at a presidential forum Tuesday. The event was moderated by Eytan Wallace (center) from Annenberg Media. Wanting He | Daily Trojan
Presidential tickets Debbie Lee and Blake Ackerman, and Mai Mizuno and Brianna Bozek debated Tuesday night at the “Inclusion Town Hall” presidential forum. Annenberg Media reporter Eytan Wallace moderated the debate.
The two tickets discussed ways to enhance experiences for transfer students, spring admits, commuter and international students, as well as the nature of USG’s relationship with administrators on campus.        
Mizuno opened the debate by establishing herself as an advocate for students, emphasizing her roots as a campus activist before joining USG. 
“I’m not only up here as candidate Mai, but I’m also up here as activist Mai,” Mizuno said. “For three years, since day one, I have been out there marching and protesting.”
Early in the town hall, Lee laid out her vision for diversity and inclusion as well as the manifestation of both of these values in USG.
“The specific way that we ensure that all communities and groups on this campus are not only being recognized and represented, but also being celebrated for their differences is by reaching out to groups who have not historically been a part of USG,” Lee said. “We’re an organization that’s accessible to all students, whatever background you come from and one that fights for all students and celebrates all differences.”
Bozek underscored the rich and diverse nature of the undergraduate student body. A point of emphasis for Mizuno and Bozek was serving as a “mouthpiece” for students first, as opposed to catering to the administration’s interests.
“There are so many student leaders and advocates across this campus that represent a plethora of diverse experiences, backgrounds and needs,” Bozek said. “And we need to stand, again, in solidarity with them and act as a microphone for those advocates.”
Ackerman noted that the existence of great diversity in the undergraduate student body does not necessarily mean all student interests are being considered wholly and equally. 
“Our school is filled with amazing students from different backgrounds and different walks of life, and it’s important to acknowledge this because not all of us have the same experiences when we come here,” Ackerman said. “And we have to celebrate those differences, rather than just acknowledge them.” 
Ackerman noted that, should he and Lee be elected, their doors would always be open to hearing all students’ voices and perspectives.
Mizuno responded, emphasizing that she and Bozek would not only be open to listening to students in their offices, but that they would take action and be present throughout campus.
“For us, it’s not necessarily about making sure that our doors are open, but the idea that we walk outside of those doors in the office and make sure that we actually engage with those communities on Trousdale or wherever else where we could connect with each other,” Mizuno said.
Regarding administrative interests, Lee stated that USG’s autonomy relative to the administration is limited, and that she would work to create compromises.
“We want to ensure that USG is an organization that uplifts voices and doesn’t say no to administration but finds solutions and finds compromises so that all students feel supported and empowered by this University,” Lee said.
Lee spoke about closing the gap between student interests, feasibility and administrative interests regarding spaces on campus. She mentioned the importance of resourcing current spaces before focusing on new spaces.
“We want to collaborate with administrative efforts already being made to ensure that not only the spaces to be made are going to follow through, but also that the spaces that exist right now have the necessary and proper resources to support and empower all students,” Lee said.
Ackerman emphasized that there is an abundance of current resources but lack of awareness among students. For this presidential ticket, enhancing awareness of available resources was a recurring point.
“With regards to all non-traditional college students, we want to make sure that when they get here, we are making them aware of the resources available to them,” Ackerman said. “There are so many great things that this campus has to offer and we want to present them to them right away.”
Mizuno closed the debate by speaking about her own record of advocating for students.
“Anyone can come up here and tout buzzwords within the world of diversity and inclusion, but at the end of the day, it’s about backing that up with a history of fighting for these issues,” Mizuno said. “How many times have we seen our own institutions use buzzwords without following through with actions and policies?”

Wednesday marks the 18th year of National Black HIV/AIDS Awareness Day, a day established to increase awareness and decrease stigma around sexually transmitted diseases within black communities.
“HIV and AIDS disproportionately affects black youth,” said Tensie Taylor, assistant director of the USC Black Alumni Association. “To see some of the USC students [saying] they don’t even talk about their STDs or HIV status with their partner, I found that alarming because part of the ways you can prevent [the diseases] is to know your status — to have the conversation.” 
To improve dialogue around the issue, the association worked alongside the Black AIDS Institute to host an on-campus screening of 90 Days, a film about a black couple with mixed-status HIV, in January. 
“One of the most effective ways to communicate [the] message about HIV and AIDS is through entertainment, is through story, is through films that actually reflect back to the community the issues that are being addressed,”  said Phill Wilson, founder and president of the Black Aids Institute. 
The film focused on a black woman named Jessica, who contracts HIV in college, and highlighted the high risk for women in Jessica’s demographic: Black women are 16 times more likely to acquire HIV compared to white women, according to the Black Aids Institute.
“I felt like by starting this conversation, if [the screening is] successful in [going] to other colleges around the country, just to show young people [they] can prevent this,” Taylor said. 
HIV and AIDS have an intersectional impact on black communities, since aspects of class, gender and disability magnify the epidemic’s effect, according to Marie-Fatima Hyacinthe, a mobilization coordinator at the Black AIDS Institute. 
Although black Americans make up around 13 percent of the U.S. population, 45 percent of all HIV-diagnosed individuals in 2015 were black. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, gay and bisexual men are also disproportionately affected, making up 58 percent of black men diagnosed. 
“I think that the USC community should be paying attention to these issues because the fastest growing population being impacted by either STIs or HIV are college-aged students,” Wilson said.
Wilson established the Black Aids Institute in 1999 and is working to confront HIV and AIDS in what he says is a “uniquely and unapologetically black point of view,” by mobilizing black institutions, educating people and providing services to communities.
“Particularly within the LGBT communities, they are still stigmatizing language, calling people who are HIV-positive ‘dirty’ or things of that nature,” Wilson said. “The stigmas in the black communities aren’t immune from that either.”
By bringing impactful awareness events, like the 90 Days screening, to campus, Taylor aims to be a part of the effort to destigmatize HIV and AIDS. 
“The key that I want to keep reiterating is awareness and education,” Taylor said. “Because when you know something, you have the possibility to change it and … be proactive about it.”
Taylor also emphasized the necessity for USC and its student health centers to be more involved in advocating for HIV and AIDS awareness, in addition to providing faster services for students.
Currently, the Engemann Student Health Center provides an HIV test that costs approximately $30, according to its website, and most tests deliver results in at least a week. Taylor suggested implementing rapid HIV tests on campus, which provide results in a few minutes and can be used in routine testing. 
As a result of the stigma surrounding HIV and AIDS in the black community, people are less likely to get tested and receive treatment, Hyacinthe said.
White men make up the majority of pre-exposure prophylaxis prescriptions, a daily preventative HIV pill for people at risk. And only 15 percent of PrEP prescriptions were filled by women, with black women constituting an even smaller percentage, according to the Black Aids Institute. 
“We still see disparities based on race, gender, sexual orientation, socioeconomic class, education and region in the country where you live,” Wilson said.  But, he said he believes the U.S. has the medical capability to end the AIDS epidemic.
“I just want this conversation to continue and to spread awareness and education, and to get college students talking,” Taylor said. “And so just to encourage people to know your status, be safe, protect yourself, and know that you do have it, it’s not a death sentence.”

Issa Rae, a writer and actress for HBO’s Insecure spoke at Bovard Auditorium Tuesday night. She spoke about her identity as a black woman and how the entertainment industry is moving in a direction that is increasingly empowering for black creators.

The event, called “Issa Rae and the Black Perspective,” was put together by the Graduate Student Government, the Black Student Assembly and the Student Assembly for Gender Empowerment. 
 The event began with a screening of the pilot episode of Insecure, after which there was a question and answer session led by GSG Director of Diversity and Equity Sarah Toutant and USC Black Student Assembly co-executive director Saphia Jackson. 
“I think ultimately we wanted to create a chance for students, faculty, and staff to listen to a conversation about blackness,“ Toutant said. “A conversation that students of all ages and all backgrounds would be interested in hearing.” 
Rae said she was not afraid to use her HBO show Insecure to discuss sensitive topics, including race, interracial dating and the needs of underserved student populations. She also talked about how students could enter the entertainment industry as creators.
Rae said that aspiring writers should try and obtain a job as a writer’s production assistant. 
“Research some favorite shows, find the entry level staff writers on those shows, and try to see if those writers will let you work with them even if it is for free,” Rae said. 
As for being a black actress in Hollywood, Rae said that she feels extremely optimistic about the power she and her peers have when creating art.
“It’s all love, and we’re all supporting each other,” Rae said. “People are making a conscious effort to empower other voices behind the scenes. It feels like a ‘black people’s’ time, a women’s time.”
Toutant, who planned the talk, said her goal was to plan an event that not only allowed people to listen to a discussion on the black experience, but allowed them to participate in the discussion. 
“We didn’t want to bring someone here and put all of the pressure on them to talk,” Toutant said.
Rae also came to USC last November as a part of the USC Annenberg-HBO Diverse Voices Forum, where she talked about her career as a creator and how being a black woman impacted it. 
When setting out to plan the event, Toutant said she was hoping to do more than just bring another speaker to campus. 
“[Issa Rae] is someone who we see in our generation who uses their blackness as a platform to bring issues to light in the black community,” Toutant said. 
Not only did she believes the fact that Rae being a millenial made her more relatable to USC students, but she also believed the popularity of Insecure made Rae more appealing to diverse audiences. 
“I know people that watch her show that are in their 40s, 50s and 60s,” Toutant said. “I also know people that watch her show who are in high school and college, so she breaks a lot of barriers when it comes to the communities in which she speaks.” 
Toutant said she wanted people to witness a conversation that related to the black experience and to create an environment where race could be talked about openly.
“If we can create a space where we critically talk about race, it’s not only going to make us think about our different perspectives and experiences but it’s going to allow us to be a more cohesive community,” Toutant said. “And that way we can talk about the issues that we face every single day.”

USC has ranked among the nation’s top five universities in fundraising for its sixth consecutive year since 2012. According to the Council for Aid to Education, the University received the fifth highest total for cash gifts by the end of 2017. 
“USC’s academic mission and priorities continue to inspire investments in our future,” Albert R. Checcio, USC senior vice president for university advancement, said in the press release. “This impressive level of giving demonstrates that members of the Trojan Family recognize the value of supporting our talented students, outstanding faculty, innovative researchers and dedicated health care providers.”
Last year, USC topped its record by bringing in $668 million, compared to $667 million in 2016 and $653 million in 2015. 
In addition to being one of the top fundraising universities, USC also boasts a high rate of undergraduate alumni donors. Forty-two percent of the University’s donors are undergraduate alumni. The amount of alumni donations has ranked USC at the top among the Pac-12 schools and all major research institutions of its size. 
Undergraduate alumni participation increased from 32 percent since the launch of Campaign for USC in 2011. This campaign, which has secured support from donors, corporations and foundations set the largest fundraising goal in higher education $6 billion. With this goal in mind, alumni and others continue to gift the University with donations.
According to the press release from Monday, USC has received $6.58 billion in campaign cash and pledges. More than 364,000 donors have been involved in the campaign. 
All of the gifted donations are to support the University’s endowment, campus infrastructure, capital projects and academic programs. In addition, the campaign has donated $373 million for endowed student scholarships and fellowships, more than 100 faculty positions and more than 20 new institutes. 
The most recent project at the University is the USC Village, which was designed into a 15-acre residential and retail center for the campus and Los Angeles community. In the next two years, USC plans to fund its upcoming $270 million project to renovate the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum, which will be renamed the United Airlines Memorial Coliseum.

Leon “Ndugu” Chancler, an adjunct assistant USC Thornton School of Music professor in percussion, jazz studies and popular music, died on Saturday in Los Angeles. He was 65.

Chancler was a professional drummer who recorded with Frank Sinatra, Tina Turner and other artists. He was also on multiple Michael Jackson songs like  “Thriller” and “Billie Jean.” 
Chris Sampson, the founding director of the popular music program, confirmed his death to the Daily Trojan. Sampson said Chancler died of complications due to cancer, but he did not specify the type of cancer. 
“He has been instrumental in developing and maintaining the quality of the popular music program,” Sampson said. “He was an amazing colleague and a vital part of our program.”
Along with percussion, Chancler was also a songwriter, and his work on the Dazz Band song “Let it Whip” earned him a Grammy nomination in 1982. 
Chancler also worked with Santana and George Duke through his songwriting, and played percussion instruments for artists like Lionel Ritchie and Miles Davis, according to the Thornton website.
“His versatility, his vast knowledge of multiple genres of music, his resume with massive experience as a drummer, as a producer, as a composer, made him a very broad, well-rounded musician,” jazz studies program chair Bob Mintzer said.
He also performed and recorded music with Patrice Rushen — the chair of the Thornton popular music program — who has known Chancler since high school, when both of them attended the Locke High School in South Los Angeles. 
“We were good friends because I think our feelings about music were the same,” Rushen said. “We had each other to talk about how we love so much music, and so many different kinds of music, that we wanted to be capable of playing anything.”
She said Chancler could play every genre of popular music, and every kind of jazz, in addition to being a skilled composer and producer. 
Chancler started teaching at USC in 1995.
“To his last day, he was teaching and preparing for subsequent days of teaching,” Mintzer said. “He’s always been the most jovial, positive, uplifting person you’d ever want to meet. He was a beacon of light in our program.”
Chancler primarily taught one-on-one drum set classes for percussion majors, but he was also a frequent guest speaker in other Thornton classes, Sampson said. Luke Woodle, a junior majoring in jazz studies, took one-on-one percussion classes with Chancler. 
“I met him my sophomore year, I realized after my freshman year what I was missing out on by not studying with him,” Woodle said. “From day one, he was the warmest person and welcomed me into the studio with love. That was our first interaction, and I remember it very clearly. Since day one, all the way to the last day that I saw him, he was always like that.”
Woodle also said that Chancler’s warm personality was paired with a direct and constructively critical teaching style. 
“He was very real, was very honest,” Woodle said. “So if you were dropping the ball, he’d let you know how badly you dropped the ball. Which was a really great thing, because he found a balance between being supportive and being critical in a constructive way.”
According to Rushen, Chancler taught more than just music. 
“He cared a lot about the students, and he cared a lot about their relationship to the music,” Rushen said. “It forced them to understand the privilege it is to be an artist, the privilege it is to play music and also instilled in them a certain responsibility of being able to always come to something that you love a lot with respect and joy and excellence.”
Chancler also put out his own musical projects. He recorded two albums under the name of Ndugu and the Chocolate Jam Co., “The Spread of the Future” in 1979, and “Do I Make You Feel Better” in 1980. In 2001 and 2007, Chancler recorded albums with Rushen and music producer Stanley Clarke. 
Chancler is survived by his wife, Brenda Curry and his son, Rashon Chancler.
The Thornton School of Music is planning a memorial for Chancler, but they are still discussing how to honor his contribution and legacy at the school, Rushen said.
