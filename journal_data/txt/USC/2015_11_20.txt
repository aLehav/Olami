For those staying local for Thanksgiving, packing is as easy as loading up the car. But for students going back East, or other colder climates around the country, packing can become quite the ordeal.
At first you are beyond excited for the cold

via GIPHY
You fantasize about the sweaters, coats, and boots you’ll wear

via GIPHY
And you think packing is going to be like this

via GIPHY
So you leave it for the night before

via GIPHY
Then you remember you barely own anything for the cold anymore

via GIPHY
And that you have an assignment due before you go

via GIPHY
You desperately raid your closet..and your roommate’s

via GIPHY
But winter wear takes up a lot of room in your suitcase

via GIPHY
You try to squeeze everything in anyways

via GIPHY
And then you remember home plus the holidays means new clothes

via GIPHY
So you settle on bringing just your favorites

via GIPHY
Yet somehow it is still enough for the airline to ask that you check your bag

via GIPHY
Regardless, it is finally time for break! Happy Thanksgiving!!

Artists ILoveMakonnen and Miguel will perform at Conquest, the Undergraduate Student Government Concerts Committee announced Friday. 
“We decided to go ahead with these two artists because we think that not only are they complementary to one another, but they’re also a really exciting way to bring the community together with a pumped-up, really exciting Makonnen set and then a soulful, exciting Miguel set,” said Judah Joseph, executive director of Concerts Committee. “It’s a great way to end off before Thanksgiving and lead us on to beating the Bruins on Saturday.”
ILoveMakonnen will open the show followed by Miguel, the headliner for Monday’s concert.
The concert is part of the annual Conquest rally that takes place before the USC-UCLA rivalry football game. Conquest is organized by the Office of Campus Activities, USG Program Board, Trojan Pride and USG Concerts Committee.
Hailing from Atlanta, Georgia, ILoveMakonnen gained popularity last year when the rapper Drake remixed his song “Tuesday.” On Friday, the artist released a new extended play, “ILoveMakonnen 2,” the sequel to his debut extended play “ILoveMakonnen” released in December 2014. 
Miguel, a Grammy-award winning artist and Los Angeles native, released his third album, Wildheart, in June. His second album, Kaleidoscope Dream, released in September 2012, was nominated for a Grammy award for Best Urban Contemporary Album at the 2013 Grammys. Miguel took home the Grammy for Best R&B Song for “Adorn,” featured on the album.

Consider taking a fun elective next semester, like Surfing. Flickr/CreativeCommons
While most USC students will only have to take 16 units each semester in order to graduate with a degree in four years, filling in the remaining two units covered by tuition with a fun class can really add some excitement to the regular drone of major and General Education classes. Whether the two units are placed toward a high-energy physical education class or a relaxing songwriting class, in two units or less, an elective class can substantially reduce your stress throughout the week. Check out some of these great two unit classes to spice up your schedule next semester.
1. Surfing (PHED 115)
Tired of disappointing your out-of-state friends when you tell them you don’t surf even though you live in Southern California? This one-unit class runs through the Dornsife Physical Education Program, and will teach students fundamental surfing and swimming skills in beautiful Santa Monica. With the beach as your classroom, you will learn about wave and forecast interpretation with regard to surfing and finally acquire a non-stereotypical account of surf culture.
Surfing is offered on Fridays at 8 a.m., 10 a.m. and 12 p.m.
2. Hip-Hop Dance (DANC 185)
Hip-hop culture is all around us, yet many people may not know the roots of hip-hop music and dance. In this two-unit class, you will learn the fundamentals of hip-hop dance ranging from popping to locking to breaking. Freestyling is not only encouraged, but required. Take this class to grace the dance floor at your next party with moves that deviate from jumping up and down and fist pumping.
Hip-hop dance is offered Monday and Wednesday at 2-3:20 p.m., Monday and Wednesday at 5-6:20 p.m., Tuesday and Thursday at 3:30-4:50 p.m., Friday at 10-11:50 a.m. and Friday at 12-1:50 p.m.
3. Visual Effects (CTAN 462)
Want to learn the how-to of production for popular and traditional visual effects in film? Visual Effects will walk you through an introduction to the process of visual effects development while you study techniques and examples of visual effects throughout the evolution of film. You’ll run visual effect circles around movies like Troll 2 after taking this 2-unit course.
This class needs D-clearance, but if you qualify the class is offered Monday at 7-9:50 p.m. and Friday at 1-3:50 p.m.
4. “Introduction to Adobe Photoshop” (ITP 090x)
Move past the mediocrity of Instagram and VSCO filters and hone in on your Photoshop skills with this two-unit class. Learn to take photos and edit them digitally to enhance or completely transform an image into a new picture. Skills learned in this fun two-unit class could be transferred to graphic designs for clubs or extracurricular activities, social media or just personal art.
“Introduction to Adobe Photoshop” is offered Monday at 3:30-6:50 p.m., 5-7:50 p.m. and Tuesday at 5-7:50 p.m.
5. “Improvisation and Theater Games” (THTR 122)
Take this two-unit improvisation theater class that will push you out of your comfort zone while having a few laughs. A class filled with both theater and non-theater majors, this class will be an excellent stress-reliever from a busy week and help you with interpersonal skills in everyday life.
“Improvisation and Theater Games” is offered Monday at 2-3:50 p.m., 4-5:50 p.m., 6-7:50 p.m., Tuesday at 4-5:50 p.m., Wednesday at 2-3:50 p.m., Thursday at 4-5:50 p.m. and Friday at 2-3:50 p.m. and 4-5:50 p.m.
6. Songwriting (MUSC 255)
We can’t all be famous musicians, but this Thornton School of Music class will set you up with the fundamental skills you need to write and compose your own music, whether it is for your own personal playlist or a video or presentational project. Additionally, you will be given the opportunity to analyze popular music composition and relate popular music trends to what you learn in class.
Songwriting is offered Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday at 4-5:50 p.m.

Well, this looks awkward. Alexa Edwards | Daily Trojan
Awkward situations are, well, awkward. Whether it be an accidental or anticipated scenario, we find ourselves in awkward situations more often than we would like to. That sinking feeling in your stomach when you misinterpret what someone says, or when you do something clumsy in front of someone you like is obviously something we actively try to avoid. Interactions with others, especially new people, are difficult to participate in without the “awkward” component. However, there are always ways to navigate social situations that can make them less of a chore.
1. Being left alone with a friend of a friend
Everyone is familiar with that feeling of panic when you are left alone with your friend’s friend only moments after meeting them. To take out the phone or not to take out the phone, that is the question. Do not take out the phone. Use the opportunity to get to know this person. After all, you do share a mutual friend and it might even alleviate the pressure on your friend to break the ice between you two. Skip the “What’s your major?” question and try asking if they have seen your current favorite TV show.
2. Crashing into a biker, skateboarder or pedestrian
Regardless if you are the biker, the boarder or the pedestrian, a crash between any of you — or all of you — is usually pretty embarrassing. Whether you were the cause of the crash, or if you were just a victim, a way to break the awkwardness is assuring that everything is okay. If you crashed into someone, just apologize (even if it was a pedestrian walking down a ramp). If you were crashed into, apologize as well (even if the biker definitely saw you beforehand). More often than not, a crash can usually be avoided, but small spaces and short reaction times can yield this result. The faster you walk away, the faster you and everybody else will get over it.
3. Seeing your crush when you’re not looking your best
Given the never-ending stream of midterms throughout the semester, it is highly likely that this will happen at least once or twice. There are two options with handling this situation: fake your confidence, or run away. If you fake your confidence enough, eventually it will start to feel real. Imagine that you look as good as you normally would, and not only will you trick yourself into forgetting what you look like that day, your crush might take notice as well. If you want to avoid bringing any attention to yourself, as stated before, just run away!
4. Walking the same direction as the person coming toward you
If only the little dance between two people both walking right, and then left, and then right again was as romantic as it is awkward. A general rule of thumb is walking to your right. If you walk right and the person coming toward you also walks right (their left), walk right again as they should naturally go the opposite direction. If you both move right again, just stop moving and let that person pass.
5. Running into someone you hooked up with
This is pretty dependent on your personality and the situation. If you forgot to get this person’s number, this can be a chance to try and get it. If you don’t want to speak to this person, but you also don’t want to be rude, don’t feel obligated to say hi unless you make eye contact. This is something that’s pretty avoidable overall, but if you have to step up to the plate, just act normal so they will act normal. Chances are, they are probably internally freaking out as well.
From the icebreakers at orientation to the networking events in the latter half of college, how to gracefully introduce yourself to a stranger is something you should learn before we step into “the real world,” and will remain important even after we enter it.
See it as practice and a chance to improve your social skills, l rather than a spotlight on your social shortcomings. We all have some awkwardness within us, so embrace it.

Contributed by Jasmine Zahedi | Daily Trojan
When I returned to Shanghai after a weeklong field trip to Sichuan, I realized just how little time I have left in this wonderful city and, rightfully so, got a little emotional. I had just spent a week exploring a new part of China and making friends with people in my program I had not gotten to know yet. And in a little over a month I have to leave? How is that possible? This is what’s been running through my head the past couple days.
1. A semester abroad isn’t enough time
Though my semester is still not over, I feel like it has flown by. I’m nowhere near ready to return to the United States. I feel completely settled in and content with my life here. I can’t imagine leaving. I honestly think that studying abroad for a year is the best way to go because three months just isn’t enough time to see everything, make serious language gains or gain exposure to everything your city has to offer.
2. How am I supposed to leave my friends?
It’s crazy how quickly friendships form while abroad. It’s like repeating freshman year all over again. The shared culture shock plays a big part, but having small classes and living in the dorms also contribute to the strong bonds that form. I’ve become incredibly close to a few people and gotten so used to seeing their familiar faces around campus, that I can’t even imagine what life will be like without them. Almost all the friends I’ve made go to schools on the East Coast, so it’s unlikely that I’ll see them any time soon. Thinking about that really scares me and makes me sad.
3. So much to do, so little time
I feel like I haven’t seen, done or tasted everything that Shanghai has to offer. Obviously that’s an impossible feat, but I’d like to at least come close. While my mom has been visiting me in Shanghai this week, being with her has allowed me to explore more, and I really appreciate that. I didn’t realize how expansive Shanghai’s subway system is, so now that I know, I’m definitely going to take greater advantage of my weekends.
4. Going beyond my Shanghai
There’s so much more to China than Shanghai and Beijing. After going to Sichuan and hearing about my roommate’s experience in northwest China, I realized that I definitely need to return to China. There’s so much I haven’t seen, so many cultures I haven’t experienced. China’s has such an interesting mix of cultures because it has small villages and huge cities. It also has a big Muslim influence in certain parts, which I find fascinating. Despite China’s various levels of development, continuities of habit, religion and culture have largely remained intact.  I realize I’m studying abroad in such a diverse country, most populated country in the world, and I don’t want to leave.

With L.A. in the midst of a cold front, it is perfectly acceptable for Californians to hop on fall’s turtleneck trend. Once viewed as an item reserved for soccer moms and librarians, high-necked tops have transcended not only this year’s runways, but also popular culture. From Valentino to Drake, everyone is on board with turtlenecks. However, for the average college student, it can be difficult to style them without falling into one of those classic stereotypes. Find out how to wear this fall favorite below.\
Cozy up in a sweater and jeans
A style perfect for L.A.’s moderate climate, this turtleneck walks the line between early fall and full on winter. The tank-top style contrast the warm knit material, making it perfect to pair with a jacket on chillier days. Turtlenecks also look great with jeans to keep the vibe more laidback even when the high neckline says stuffy and conservative.
Asos New Look Roll Neck Sleeveless Tabard $36.00
A Layering Gem
Thanks to turtlenecks you can turn those summer dresses into suitable winter wear. Opt for thinner turtlenecks made of cotton or nylon material that will serve as neutral base for a patterned dress. I love this simple knit from Zara because the ribbing and embellished sleeves offer a bit more personality to an otherwise plain piece. 
Zara Polo Neck Sweater $29
For An Evening Out
Who says turtlenecks aren’t meant for the club? If the Hotline Bling video is any indication, Drake certainly doesn’t. This season, designers have gotten creative with turtleneck-wear, including implementing the style into eveningwear. This ribbed dress from Nastygal is a perfect example of how to wear a turtleneck out when you don’t want to deal with losing your jacket at a party. The simplicity of the dress also allows you to have fun with accessories. Pair it with a statement necklace or channel your inner Blair Waldorf with a headband.  
Nasty Gal Somebody to Love Ribbed Turtleneck Dress$40.60
The Classic
The oversized turtleneck sweater will never go out of style. It is a tried and true classic every collegiate can keep in their closet. Similar to its short-sleeved counterpart, throw it on over jeans and your favorite knee high boots for a classy yet comfortable classroom outfit. You can also layer the opposite way by throwing it over a dress or skirt. But to be honest my favorite use for this classic is in the comfort of my bedroom, paired with some well-worn sweatpants. You feel like a cozy burrito, and really, what is better than that?

In the world of nutrition, sometimes, it can feel like everything is bad for you. While several studies will caution against the dangers of saturated fats, others might link saturated fats to decreased cardiovascular risk. It can be difficult to navigate through all of this information, especially when it’s conflicting. But there’s one thing that food scientists have warned against with little refutation — acrylamide.
The potential health risks of cooking high starch foods became apparent in 2002, when high levels of acrylamide, a carcinogenic chemical, was first associated with heating up plant-based foods, such as boiling potatoes or toasting bread. Since then, this issue has been in the consciousness of the scientific community. In 2011, the Joint Food and Agriculture Organization and the World Health Organization Expert Committee on Food Additives conclusively linked high acrylamide exposure to cancer in animal studies.
This month, the Food Standard Agency, the United Kingdom’s equivalent to the Food and Drug Administration, released a second report to bring public attention to acrylamide and its health threats. Acrylamide, while it is clearly dangerous, has not led to much public action, perhaps because it’s hard to believe. How could something so mundane as a potato turn into a carcinogen? It turns out, acrylamide forms from a simple reaction in starchy foods. Add a little heat, and the amino acids and sugars in food react together. The process, called Maillard reaction, contributes to the browning of cooked foods as well as “roasting” aromas and flavors. In short, what makes food taste good can also make it harmful. But, for college students, cooking is a feat in and of itself, so here are a few simple tips to make it easier to avoid acrylamide at home:
Acrylamide has only been linked to cancer when it’s present in high concentrations. To minimize acrylamide, cook foods on heat for shorter lengths and at lower temperatures. The FDA recommends steaming and boiling over frying, roasting or baking.
Starchy foods and grains are essential to the American diet. It would probably be more harmful to eliminate them from your diet, and very unrealistic. The FDA, however, found that acrylamide levels are higher in heated foods that are rich in added sugars (which react with the amino acids) and salt. Some brands of bread have added sugar, so make sure to check the label before you toast it!
Use browning as an indicator of acrylamide formation, abd keep your toaster settings on low. Though a little technical, the FDA recommends toasting bread to a “golden yellow.” The same can be said for fried food. If you’re craving French fries, the yellower the fries, the less acrylamide they likely have!
As with all nutritional advice, these recommendations need to be taken with a grain of salt, but the dangers of acrylamide are real, and the solutions are pretty simple, so why not put more weight on prevention?
