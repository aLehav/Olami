When sophomore forward Isaiah Mobley hit the first basket of the game, a 3-pointer to open his scoring, his shooting stroke was smooth and confident. His aggressive attitude didn’t stop there, as Mobley went on to light the Kansas Jayhawks up early with four threes and 14 total points in the first half. The Trojans rode his hot hand through the first period, taking a 40-21 into the break. Head coach Andy Enfield and company wouldn’t step off the gas in the second half, and the No. 6 Trojans rode their phenomenal defense to a 85-51 upset win over No. 3 Kansas in Indianapolis, Ind. Monday night.
“I’ve been shooting well, so the coaches have been giving me all the confidence to shoot it,” Isaiah said. “When I got my opportunities, I took them … I don’t necessarily like to sit on the three always, but if they’re giving it to me I’m gonna take them.”
Evenly spread-out scoring has been a recipe for USC’s success this season, and this game was no different. The team had five players in double digits for points: Isaiah finished with 17, freshman forward Evan Mobley had 10, redshirt senior guards Isaiah White and Tahj Eaddy had 13 and 12, respectively, and Chevez Goodwin chipped in 10 off the bench. 
“Everyone contributed tonight whether it showed up on the stat sheet or not,” Isaiah said. “That’s the reason we won by the margin that we did against such a great, prestigious school like Kansas … Like I said, when we’re confident, I believe in our team, that we could go up against anybody.”
Enfield, who has resided over the men’s basketball programs’ rise over the last few years, has the Trojans in the Sweet 16 for the first time since 2007. He dedicated the win to his late father who passed away last September. 
“I thought about him a lot, in fact, I saw a picture of him right before the game that my mother sent me,” Enfield said. “He was a total man-to-man coach — I’m sure he would’ve been very happy to see our zone [defense] tonight. But thank you, dad. You meant a lot to me as a coach and as a father.”
The team’s coaching staff had some extra motivation to win, according to Enfield, which came from pregame forecasts on CBS that predicted Kansas as the winners.
“I really wanna thank CBS,” he said. “They said Andy Enfield coached teams and USC teams [are] so undisciplined … We were extremely hungry, and the coaches were just as hungry as the players.”
Kansas started off the game ice cold from the field, missing 10 of its first 11 shots before calling a timeout down 12-3 with 12:43 to go in the first half. USC’s defense stifled the Jayhawks for a good portion of the first half, allowing the Trojan offense to find rhythm and go on an 11-0 run to end the first half.
The Jayhawks did their best to mount a second half comeback, but simply couldn’t knock down their shots, even the open ones. Kansas shot 29% from the field on the night, and key players such as junior forward David McCormack weren’t able to get many good looks at the basket. 
“Just making sure we limited [McCormack’s] touches,” Isaiah said. “He’s a big, active dude … Limiting his touches helped us slow him down because when he caught it in there, he was a load to guard.” 
USC’s win cemented its spot as the fourth Pac-12 team to make the Sweet 16 in this year’s tournament, joining UCLA, Oregon State and Oregon. The Trojans will move on to face the No. 7 Oregon Ducks, who are fresh off an upset of the No. 2 Iowa Hawkeyes. 
“As a member of the conference, you wanna see [other conference teams] do well,” Isaiah said. “I feel like our conference has been a little bit disrespected throughout the year … But now, we’re showing when it matters most, what our conference can do.”
The Trojans will continue their tournament run against the Ducks Sunday. The Sweet 16 matchup tips off at 6.45 p.m.
“This is literally what you dream for,” Isaiah said. “Future says ‘Beat the odds, do numbers and remain humble.’ So just trying to keep that motto and just keep it rolling from here on out.”

Baseball kicked off Pac-12 play by sweeping the Washington Huskies in a three-game series this past weekend. 
This is the first sweep of a conference opponent for the Trojans since 2015 against Arizona. The sweep also pushes the Trojans’ win streak to six, after another series sweep of Nevada last week.
“It’s hard to sweep anybody but especially the opening weekend of conference when everybody is in the hunt and every game matters,” head coach Jason Gill said. “Every game is so important but to open up your conference play with a sweep … they were really excited.” 
The Trojans were returning the favor from the last time the two teams met, when the Huskies swept the Trojans in a three-game series in 2019. Washington leaves the series with an 8-9 record and will face Gonzaga Tuesday. USC is starting to heat up after having a slow start to the season. 
“When you win you start getting that feeling when you show up to the field every day that you’re going to win so that’s always the momentum you like to ride because two weeks ago that wasn’t our feeling and that’s how quick this can switch,” Gill said. 
The team won the first game of the series Friday by a score of 3-2, taking the second Saturday by a final score of 7-5. 
USC won the third game of the series 11-3 on Sunday to complete the sweep. The Trojans came out with a strong start to the game going up 4-0 in the first inning with two RBI singles from redshirt senior infielder John Thomas and redshirt junior infielder Ben Ramirez and an RBI double from redshirt freshman infielder Tyresse Turner. 
Redshirt junior infielder Jamal O’Guinn and redshirt senior infielder Tyler Pritchard each added RBI singles in the fourth and fifth innings respectively, to push the lead to 6-0. 
The Trojan defense allowed Washington to score on an RBI single from redshirt freshman infielder Dalton Chandler and an RBI double from redshirt freshman outfielder Cole Miller in the sixth to put the Huskies only three runs behind the Trojans with a score of 6-3. 
O’Guinn followed with an RBI single in the seventh inning in another strong game, finishing with four hits and two RBI. 
USC finished the game strong with two RBI doubles from redshirt freshman outfielder Rhylan Thomas and Turner in the ninth to secure the win. 
“Our offense is slowly getting better, but I don’t think it’s where it’s going to be in about two weeks,” Gill said. “I think it’s going to continue to get better and better and then we’re still finding out. Our guys on the mound, especially some of our young guys, are still learning how to pitch at this level because we didn’t have a fall so they are learning how to do it in games.” 
Redshirt sophomore pitcher Alex Cornwell carried the Trojans defense through the first five innings and half of the sixth before exiting the game. Redshirt freshman pitcher Ethan Hoopingarner took over for the end of the sixth and the seventh. Redshirt senior pitcher Quentin Longrie and redshirt junior pitcher Brian Gursky finished the game pitching one inning each. 
“We’re going to continue to get better on the mound, we’re going to continue to get better defensively, and we’re going to continue to get better offensively,” Gill said. “We have a long way to go, we are far from where we need to be.” 
USC will host San Diego Tuesday at Dedeaux Field. First pitch is 6 p.m.

The doo-wop sounds of Johnnie & Joe’s “Over the Mountain, Across the Sea” welcome viewers to “Godzilla vs. Kong,” the latest crossover to come out of Lengendary Entertainment and Warner Bros. Pictures’ MonsterVerse industrial complex. 
King Kong is waking up from a restful nap before taking his daily walk across Skull Island, a “Hunger Games: Crossing Fire”-esque virtual megadome habitat that secures him from the public and from outside threats. Up to meet him at a turn of the song to the lyric “a girl waits for me” is Jia (Kaylee Hottle), a deaf Indigenous girl whose bond to Kong is unlike any other, and of course, borne of trauma.
Kong is feeling restless, and Jia can sense his discomfort. Alluding to a looming conflict, Kong “expert” and researcher Ilene Andrews (Rebecca Hall) utters those fateful words that seal the deal of the film: “There can’t be two alpha titans.”
Someone else can sense a threat, and we move to meet Bernie Hayes, a janitor at Apex Cybernetics that plays investigator and conspiracy theorist when no one is looking. Brian Tyree Henry does the absolute best that he can with the corny lines given to him about the Illuminati, lizard people and whatever, but even he cannot truly bring us to care about anyone in this film besides Jia. His voice on his podcast opens up an overarching theme of corporate conspiracy, and just as he is about to gather some information, someone shows up.
The U.S. headquarters of Apex is in the lovely Pensacola, Fla., and it makes sense why Godzilla would want to destroy as much in his path in that Godforsaken state. But Bernie doesn’t believe this attack was random, and convinces listeners that something is afoot, because Godzilla only attacks when provoked, like me.
One of those listeners is the daughter of an Apex director, Madison Russell, played rather flatly by Millie Bobby Brown. As her high school class watches the CNN broadcast of Godzilla stomping on some buildings and giving some mighty roars, Russell puts in AirPods to tune into Bernie, ultimately deciding to find him and see what’s truly going on at Apex. It’s some really weird attempt at bringing ’80s adventure humor to modern anecdotes, and almost none of the jokes land.
Apex founder and evil man Walter Simmons (Demián Bichir) meanwhile travels to Pennsylvania (there’s maybe one good location chosen in this movie) to connect with professor Nathan Lind (Alexander Skarsgård), a nut of a man who pushes the Hollow Earth theory which argues that  the Earth’s core is home to an insurmountable power source that generates some of the monster titans like Kong and Godzilla. Simmons wants that power, but for what?
Skarsgård absolutely cannot play the timid nerd that this film wants him to be, but sends him on a mission anyway to get Kong so that he and Apex can reach Hollow Earth, because Flat Earth was too mainstream. Against Jia’s wishes, Dr. Andrews accepts the idea that Kong could finally be home safe down there, and they venture off for the only opening to the core at Antarctica. Along the way, no matter what water they drag a sedated monster ape across, Godzilla finds them. 
As you can see, there’s a lot of different interests to keep track of in this film, dulling down any commentary on corporate motives, human fallibility, the danger of technology or taking advantage of something that some fans of the MonsterVerse like to project on to these movies. Screenwriters Eric Pearson and Max Borenstein can put whatever little Hail Mary’s to moral ideology they want in “Godzilla vs. Kong” — no one should care about that coming from the abusers of two excellent monster conceptions. 
With incredible visual effects, Apex’s motives once they reach the core are revealed and rather quickly dismantled by Kong’s sense of danger. Simmons’ daughter Maya (Eiza González) is able to harvest a sample of the power source for the company’s newest ambition, a robot monster titan fashioned after Godzilla that uses neural networks to become smarter and more lethal as it learns. 
Not to be replaced, Godzilla travels to Hong Kong where this beast of a machine wakes up. In a stunning sequence, Godzilla starts tearing through the land adjacent to the Pearl River Delta, leaving buildings lit up in rainbow colors that brighten the night. 
When Kong backs through the layers of the Earth to reach Hong Kong and this new threat (apparently you can build an underground tunnel to China), the showdown begins. Godzilla and Kong go at it like never before, crumbling the lights of the city under their bodies like a reverse pinball machine. Not much has changed about these two — Kong still has a mean right hook and Godzilla is not to be underestimated — and that’s perhaps the most comforting part of this entire movie. 
They can’t rest when the robot Mechagodzilla decides to rear its ugly head. While Godzilla is getting his shit rocked against this abomination, the little humans have to figure something out. I’ll let you enjoy that absolute idiotic narrative peak. 
It really is hard to enjoy a film like this when the origins of both Kong and Godzilla are so drawn out and twisted that they are unrecognizable besides that little “Property of Toho Co., Ltd.” note in the opening credits. Their screen partners never live up to their prestige, but there is something magical in seeing them with such great effect and attention to disaster detail. It gives me great joy to think about the next time I’ll be able to see them in theaters again, in whatever iteration or quality I can.

Last semester, for my final paper in my “Postwar Hollywood” class, I wrote about “Flower Drum Song” and representations of Chinese identity and the immigrant woman. It was something very close to my heart as a Chinese American, because at its core, “Flower Drum Song” is a politicized rendering of Chinese American identity at the intersection of race and gender.
“Flower Drum Song” focuses on the story of Mei Li, who comes to the United States as an undocumented immigrant. She’s submissive and docile, a representation of “China.” It’s why later in the film, she becomes open to “assimilation,” viewed as a positive process. Mei Li is quiet and vulnerable, but she has the American dream. In the film, this process of “Americanization” consumes her entire identity. 
I’m thinking about this, about Asian women being viewed as objects, because last week, six Asian women were shot at three spas in Atlanta, Georgia. The accused gunman was a white man who perceived these women as a platform for him to project his aggression onto, describing the massage parlor as a “temptation he wanted to eliminate.” 
Anti-Asian hate is nothing new. There’s an external pressure to talk about anti-Asian racism in the United States as an Asian person and serve as “spokesperson” on this issue in white spaces. I’m arguing against that. Instead of merely tokenizing and uplifting Asian scholars and leaders when a hate crime happens to the community, I invite everyone and anyone to care about Asian people on a regular basis — not just because it’s “timely.” 
I also invite everyone to think critically about the media we consume, more specifically how Sinophobic representations popularized in the media and by the media have contributed to the history and current legacies of anti-Asian hate. 
I don’t think it needs repeating that for the past year, there has been deeply racist rhetoric about China and Chinese people. I’m not just talking about the “Chinese virus” or “China virus,” because those have already been cited many times. I’m talking about the decline in U.S.-China relations, The Wall Street Journal op-ed published last year calling China the “sick man of Asia.” I’m looking at the long history of Chinese people in the United States and Chinatowns racialized as diseased, Western imperialist propaganda. 
I’m talking about the incredibly powerful thread Ian Goodrum posted on Twitter chronicling visual representations of China. Sinophobia is the image of an angry red dragon looming over an “American” college campus in Foreign Policy. It’s the picture of a globe covered by a face mask in the image of a Chinese flag on the cover of The Economist. 
These representations tell us that China is a threat, but they also attach a racialized stigma to the Chinese and, more broadly, Asian identity, which has so often been subject to political, cultural and social suspicions. Consciousness of racism requires consciousness of how it’s embedded in popular imagery. 
I was originally going to discuss the blatantly racist tropes of Asian people in Hollywood, such as the villainous Chinese Fu Manchu in “The Face of Fu Manchu” or the uncool Asian caricature Long Duk Dong in “Sixteen Candles.” To be honest though, those are old and trite versions of racism, and I’m tired of talking about them. 
Anti-Chinese and, more broadly, anti-Asian racism occurs in more than one singular racist representation in a film, but in the entirety of popular culture. It doesn’t even have to be the most obvious ones. 
As many Asian American writers have discussed, racism against Asian women requires an intersectional approach. Jezz Chung tells us in “The Lily” that racism can be subtle, such as the fetishization and sexualization of Asian women in “Memoirs of a Geisha” or “Madame Butterfly.” 
To Chung, racism is about the power and politics of representation. To me, racism is when Asian women and women of color, who are the victims of hate crimes, become nameless people in articles that spend more time humanizing the perpetrator than the individual victims themselves. Even when these names are mentioned, they should be respected — spelled correctly in news coverage and properly pronounced by broadcast news anchors.
A few weeks ago, my mother’s car, parked next to a Chinese supermarket in a predominantly Asian American neighborhood, had its window shattered. To be honest, I don’t know if it was an anti-Asian hate crime, or if I could claim that it was “racially motivated” when asked. Yet as I stood there, looking at the tiny glass shards scattered in the passenger’s seat where I was supposed to sit, I couldn’t help thinking about the political context that had potentially informed it. 
Later, I thought about the part in “Flower Drum Song” when the love interest Wang Ta sings to Mei Li. 
“You are beautiful, small and shy,” he tells her. Mei Li can only look at him demurely.
Racism makes Asian women into beautiful, small and shy objects for white men to project their aggression or fantasies on. It can be in films like “Flower Drum Song,” where the Chinese woman is either sexy (Linda Low) or submissive (Mei Li). It occurs when Mei Li’s Chinese-ness is exotified, patronized and implied to represent China. It’s when the core of Mei Li’s very identity becomes a negative trait ready for “Americanization.” 
Most importantly, though, racism is when Mei Li, an Asian woman, is so pliable, so malleable that she becomes a concept more than a person. To me that’s the most dangerous part, because it’s also when she begins to have no identity at all.

Illuminated in colorful Instagram posts that highlight a wide range of talent, @MadeByBlackSC is a social media account created to help elevate the voices and share the work of Black artists and creatives at USC. In an environment where Black artists were not being rightfully listened to, co-founders Chloe Janson and Naomi Ituah saw the perfect opportunity to make a difference.
“Over the summer, when protests broke out due to police brutality and other social injustices, as a white, privileged student, I wanted to do something that contributed to the Black Lives Matter movement,” Janson wrote in an email to the Daily Trojan. “Because of my passion for the arts, I wanted to specifically contribute to the Black artistic community.”
Janson and Ituah met through their shared connection of being in the same cohort within the School of Cinematic Arts’ Cinema and Media Studies program. The account was created by Janson and Ituah in July 2020,  after protests broke out due to police brutality and other social injustices that had increasing levels of awareness and attention. Janson reached out to Ituah, who she knew had just led a protest in her hometown, and together they created the Instagram account and began organizing interviews, captions and communications with artists. 
Currently, the account posts spotlights on their feed about once a month, as well as  sharing a variety of materials including artists’ work on their story, resources for Black artists and posts from informational resource accounts including @blackartistfund, @blackartfuturesfund and @blacklunchtable. All of these provide unique resources for the community.
The artist spotlights consist of cute graphics that have the individuals name, photo, pronouns, artistic endeavors, samples of their work, as well as interview questions shared in the caption. 
The interview questions composed to spotlight Black USC artists and creators are extensive, diving into their Black roots, the way their heritage impacts their art and experiences when they have received less recognition than their white peers. 
“Our mission is to share in-depth features of USC Black artists,” Janson wrote. “Our interview questions are extensive. Our goal is to give our community of Black creatives a space to be honest about their work, instead of simply showcasing it to the USC community.”
Courtney Commodore, a Black artist at USC and member of Break Through Hip-Hop, was contacted by @MadeByBlackSC about doing a feature spotlight on their page. Commodore, a senior majoring in spanish and global health, spoke about her experience with the dance community, her personal connection with fans and how dance could be a force of power in the Black Lives Matter Movement. 
“To see the people that I know and that I’ve seen create and [their] growth, regardless of whatever their talents and passions are — photography, music, just all types of visual and performing arts ­— it’s been really cool to be able to see my friends get the recognition that they deserve,” Commodore said. 
Since the start of the account, they have gained nearly a thousand followers, making a real impact through the resources and support they are providing Black USC students with. 
Awo Jama, another Black USC artist who was featured on the page, was interviewed for a spotlight after stumbling upon the account and messaging them. Jama, a junior majoring in journalism, was able to share her poetry, film and writing with the USC community.
Although things at USC are starting to change, not enough recognition is given to the Black community at USC, Jama said. This account is essential in providing a safe space for shedding awareness on all of the amazing work done by Black creatives at the school.
“It’s a really great platform to elevate Black voices and Black art and expression, which often we don’t really see a lot of platforms that are wholeheartedly dedicated to just showcasing the work of Black creatives,” Jama said.
Although running the account has presented challenges, particularly in finding the time to conduct extensive interviews while balancing school and the pandemic, creating and maintaining a space for support of Black creatives is a priority, wrote Janson.
Janson and Ituah hope to continue growing the account, even post-graduation. They hope to involve current students with their team once they graduate, but still plan on being a part of the process. In addition, they want to see the account continue to grow as new classes of Trojans join the USC community.
“@MadeByBlackSC is a platform that shares with the USC community the unheard voices of USC’s Black creatives,” Janson

There’s something irresistible about donning a brand that you love. It is not as irresistible to reveal that you bought a certain product from a brand because of one of its sponsors, a polarizing concept in surfing. Do you want to be that guy that’s just parked at the beach in a Red Bull hat, Buell wetsuit and Catch Surf foamie that screams “I subscribe to Jamie O’Brien on YouTube?” Maybe you do, and companies are even more mindful of it these days.
If I had the energy to draw a Venn diagram of what sponsorship looks like in the surfing world, here’s what it might look like: You’ve got your Jamie O’Briens that work off of a vlog or other video content, bringing in GoPro and some CBD brands that complement the noncompetitive but talented freesurfer persona. You’ve got John Florence, who left a $30 million dollar contract with Hurley after Nike sold the company to brand dismantler Bluestar Alliance in Dec. 2019, to start his own line of swimwear while retaining the sponsorship of more practical brands like Nixon and Yeti. Not the last category but definitely one of the biggest is your longboarders, whose main sponsor might be Bing or Donald Takayama surfboards with an eco-friendly company and a casual clothes agreement to match. 
Not everyone fits in these categories. Kelly Slater left Quiksilver in April 2014, the first to have the advertising spot on the nose of his board free and clear of brand stickers. On the other side of the spectrum, Japanese superstar Kanoa Igarashi gets paid the big bucks from partnerships ranging from the Kinoshita Group to Visa. 
There’s a lot of corporations and small businesses that are investing into surfing, even though some of the best surfers in the world aren’t part of one of the coveted Quiksilver, Rip Curl or Billabong brands. It makes sense — surfing can be an incredibly expensive sport when it comes down to it, and for many surfers, it is their livelihood. 
So should we buy into it? Besides maybe a board sponsor, there’s something peculiar in being interested in a brand just because it picked up a seemingly random 17-year-old phenom at the beginning stages of their career, especially when you don’t even drink Monster or wear Oakley sunglasses in the first place. 
Whatever you feel when you see the stickers or logos is a product of the digital age itself. There are very few surfers who do not have a regular filmer that uploads edits of GoPro compilations that almost beg you to look at them. It’s branding in and of itself, marketing yourself as that surfer who should be the face of the brand, or someone that should at least be associated with it for whoever ends up seeing it on social media and the internet. 
There’s always going to be the concern that the sport is getting too commodified, or it is becoming too focused on image rather than talent or spirit. It’s happened with every “spiritual” sport, with skateboarding having maybe the most public debate as of recently.
But it’s also important to evaluate sponsors or companies not just in terms of how they position their partners but how they might work to exacerbate barriers to entry in the sport. This can take many forms, whether it be jacking up the price of gear to obscene levels, neglecting conservation efforts that the sport should beget or closing down beaches so that the pros can surf and the locals can’t. These practices presage the sport warping toward business rather than pleasure.
Is it true, as the writers at Stab Magazine recently wrote, that “the decisions that these brands — and most importantly, their new owners — make, shape surf culture as we know it?” Not if you work against the consequences.

The No. 4 men’s water polo team placed in second in the previously postponed 2020 NCAA Championship after a 1 point loss to No. 3 UCLA Sunday afternoon at home. Despite the loss, from Friday evening on up to the finals, the Trojans rekindled the championship-winning team spirit that defines them as one of the best programs in the world and earned them their 16th-straight NCAA appearance. 
The tournament kicked off with a tilt against Bucknell that started with a huge offensive push out of the gate from the Trojans that led to an early 6-0 lead and resulted in another six points of production in the third. 
Scores from junior 2-meter Jake Ehrhardt, with a game-high five points, and hat tricks from freshmen driver Carson Kranz and 2-meter Tony Nardelli would color the rest of the game, even as the Bison would bring back their total to 9 to make it 18-9 at the finish.
Having a lot of different players clock time in the early semifinal matchup proved advantageous for the Trojans heading into Saturday’s game against first seeded Cal.
The nailbiter of a quarterfinal tipped off with a back-and-forth rally that would continue until the fourth, where the Trojans hit a five-point streak that would eventually secure their 12-10 win. Ehrhardt and Kranz showed up again with four and three goals, respectively, but it was sophomore driver Marcus Longton that held the fourth down for the Trojans.
Even more critical was the Trojans’ defensive effort against the Bears. Junior goalie Nic Porter’s energy was unstoppable after allowing two early 5-meter penalty shots in, hitting huge blocks one after the other until the game’s finish. His spirit was also infectious, pumping the team up in the water and out, with one of the best moments of the game being a fist bump and a “see what I told you” to teammate Chris Agliozzo after the redshirt freshman driver’s first-half zinger.
The USC squad knew that maintaining steadfast energy from the Cal game would be critical to their performance in the finals, after third-seeded UCLA upset the reigning champion third-seeded Stanford.
“That’s one of the things we stress in our program, is you play a role in this team, and you play to the best of your ability,” Porter said after USC’s win against Cal. “And yeah, in particular, like our young guys, and they … everyone just stepped up, and it felt like such a cohesive team performance.”
Sunday afternoon’s title match was too quiet for a USC team that is used to a full Uytengsu Aquatics Center with friends, family and teammates cheering them on. It stayed quiet as the Bruins lept to a three-point lead in the first half. 
The energy faltered at several points with calls from referees deeming just-there shots as goals and what seemed like an exclusion rally on every drive. When the Trojans did have chances on man-up coverage, the shots were often blocked by defensive post-ups on the Bruins’ side. 
When Ehrhardt was kicked out of the game in the fourth with three exclusions to his number, USC had to fall back from their game plan of a hard press against a very active UCLA offense, giving Bruins attackers Jake Cavano and senior Nicolas Saveljic the opportunity to shoot a few in from the outside. 
“So we kind of decided not to run a regular press, like we did in the past against UCLA, in their centers,” head coach Marko Pintaric said. “So we have to start talking a little more and not allow better position for the opponent. But yeah, so that was the adjustment that we set on the bench, we’re going to try … communicate protecting ourselves versus players driving in.”
Pintaric frequently reiterates that water polo is a game of inches, and these words haunted USC’s last quarter against UCLA. Senior driver Jacob Mercep and Kranz, among others, worked to cut down the Trojans’ deficit, but ultimately, the Bruins scored one-point too many for USC to overcome.
The Trojans had more losses this season than ever before, finishing their run at 8-9 overall and 3-7 in conference. But it would be too easy to blame this on the coronavirus or not having Olympic hopefuls Hannes Daube and Marko Vavic on the roster this season. 
What USC showed in its last rally of this season, especially from the underclassmen, was that the time is now to build the team rapport that gave them huge wins over Cal in the championship and UCLA during the regular season.
“I’m very proud of my team,” Porter said at the final post-game conference. “Like my captain Luke [Wyatt] said, we lost more games [than] we ever had before, and we still made it to an NCAA final and pushed UCLA right to the end. In particular, young guys, this is a great experience for them, a great learning experience. And, you know, we’re on it, and I’m really looking forward to getting stuck in the preseason training whenever that is and working towards going one step further in the fall.”
If the Trojans are able to do this, there’s nothing stopping them next season, whenever that may be.

When Chevaughan Dyer graduated from the USC School of Dramatic Arts in 2018, he was one of three Black men in a class of 120 students. He remembers sometimes going days on campus without seeing another student or faculty member who looked like him. He said his “biggest grievance” as an undergraduate student was the Eurocentric  curriculum, more often than not forced to play cisgender white men from distant periods.
“We needed something that was bigger; we needed something that made more of a statement, something that was more permanent, that wouldn’t fade away with the students that came and left,” Dyer said. 
As an undergraduate, Dyer said he spoke to the program about feeling underrepresented. He wanted to be in class with other Black students, to play different characters and to learn about woman playwrights and non-binary producers. 
Upon graduation, Dyer took a job at the SDA dean’s office, where he worked closely under Associate Dean of Equity, Diversity & Inclusion Anita Dashiell-Sparks to oversee research, workshops and guest speaker programs aimed to reform the anglo-centric, heteronormative culture of SDA.
Following George Floyd’s murder at the hands of Minneapolis police last summer, Dyer, Dashiell-Sparks and the rest of the dean’s office began to rethink their approach to equity and inclusion. In early May, the team hosted a series of virtual forums that garnered feedback from student, alumni, staff and faculty voices.
“The strong points are reimagining and diversifying, and overhauling the curriculum to really have diverse — [Black and Indigenous people and people of color]  —  narratives foregrounded,” Dashiell-Sparks said. 
Following the events of the summer, students, alumni and staff members pushed hard for a more diverse curriculum, student body and faculty, Dashiell-Sparks said. Attendees at the public forums made clear that they wanted marginalized voices and overlooked stories at the forefront of their educational experience.
After months of community outreach, public town halls, research and internal brainstorming, SDA unveiled plans for an Equity, Diversity, and Inclusion office this past mid-February. The office is different from previous EDI initiatives — “It’s a front facing to students to say, ‘not only do we want you here, but when you’re here, look at what’s here for you,’” Dyer said. 
For both Dyer, the physical space is more than just an office. It also serves as a common ground: a place for underrepresented students, Black and Indigenous students and students of color to congregate and forge community.
“A physical space provides … a place to come and to sit and to fellowship and to have community with like-minded peers,” Dyer said. “It really just provides a hub and a center for you to engage a different part of your senses that’s not just talking — it’s sitting, it’s touching, it’s communicating, it’s eating together.”
Jennifer Franco, another SDA alumna, will join Dyer and Dashiell-Sparks as the third full-time staff member in the office. Franco, who graduated in 2016, said she was also one of the few students of color in an otherwise majority-white graduating class. Unlike Dyer, however, Franco said she never noticed feeling marginalized, overlooked or unheard.
“I never felt like I wasn’t supported; I didn’t feel like my voice wasn’t heard,” Franco said. “Knowing that people are dealing with this, that hurts me. That breaks my dang heart. The thing that I’m most excited and passionate about is knowing that being a part of this office, … I can try my best to provide what I got for the next generation.”
Until Los Angeles County lifts coronavirus restrictions, the office will continue to operate in a virtual setting — hosting online workshops, professional development training sessions and town hall forums. However, when on-campus operations return, Dashiell-Sparks and her EDI office team look to host a series of in-person guest speaker events, curate a library of plays written by people from all backgrounds for public use and utilize the center as a research hub for future EDI initiatives.
For Dyer, the importance of the arts rests in its ability to “influence and push towards a more inclusive world.” Because of the unique influence creatives have over public discourse, Dashiell-Sparks see comprehensive and forward-thinking EDI programs as particularly integral to a school like SDA. Dyer and Dashiell-Sparks The team said they hope the office can have a powerful and lasting impact on the next generation of artists, actors, playwrights and screenwriters as their work shapes the entertainment industry of tomorrow.
“This is a really exciting opportunity that … we can actually do that. We can actually begin to implement that area of our school in doing [EDI-related] work, that allows wonderful, rich collaboration and opportunities for students as well for faculty,” Dashiell-Sparks said. “These core principles and values really speak and align to our core principles and values of what it means to be an artist.”

With the onset of the pandemic keeping people at home, many turned toward online entertainment and socializing — two factors that inspired Trustin Yoon to found Discover Together, a start-up web-app that transforms Spotify’s music recommendations from a solo to a duo experience. 
By analyzing the features of each person’s 50 most listened songs — such as Danceability, Happiness and Energy — the Discover Together algorithm clusters songs with music tastes the two users have in common and recommends music in that cluster that is new for both users. During quarantine, Yoon stumbled upon the Spotify Application Programming Interface, while teaching himself coding, and was inspired to create a social experience with music. 
“My music tastes are very niche, and I thought like, ‘oh, it would be awesome to kind of experience the joy of finding a new song that I really enjoy with other people,’” Yoon, a senior majoring in business administration, said. “April, May, June, like the worst months of lockdown, [we] had to kind of get creative with you know, bonding and socializing with other people so that’s kind of where I got the idea.” 
Arjun Reddy, a graduate student studying marketing analytics, was already in contact with Yoon on LinkedIn after he had published a different data science project. After he heard Yoon’s idea, the two of them spent 50 hours over seven days to develop the basic algorithm for Discover Together. 
After making a post seeking help to develop the website on Ladder, an online community for recent college graduates to find professional opportunities, Yoon connected with Niyant Narang, a senior majoring in computer engineering at UCLA, and built a team of engineers and designers from Cornell University and the University of Waterloo. Starting in late summer, Yoon, Reddy, Narang and their team worked part-time on Zoom calls and Slack messaging to develop the web-app, which finally launched in February. 
“[Quarantine] was one of the reasons that we actually created this together,” Reddy said. “We wanted to be able to connect two individuals that, you know, might not be able to see each other in person but wanted to keep in touch.”
According to Narang, Discover Together stresses the discovery aspect of finding new music, while other third-party Spotify services recommend songs to one user that the other likes, or finds common songs between both users’ playlists. 
“This is really unique in the sense that it’s not doing either, it’s kind of a little bit of both, where it’s not only mixing your music tastes, but then finding songs that you probably haven’t listened to that you would still love,” said Narang. 
Since the algorithm analyzes each user’s top 50 songs, one challenge Reddy noticed was that less relevant genres in a user’s listening history were getting recommended equally as often as more relevant genres, so the team had to make adjustments to factor in genre relevance to ensure that only the most suitable songs would be recommended. Recently, Discover Together passed the milestone of reaching 1,500 playlists made, and Reddy is eagerly awaiting the day 10,000 playlists have been created. 
Narang’s most rewarding moment after launching Discover Together was when he was working in the library with some people and heard them discussing how much they enjoyed the web-app without knowing that he was one of the founders of the start-up. 
“Someone mentioned ‘Discover Together’ without me prompting … and then they were like, ‘Oh yeah, like I love this, this is super sick, I’ve done it with my girlfriend and we’ve found so many songs together,’” Narang said. “There’s a lot of times where you kind of just get tired of music because you’re stuck with the same songs. You don’t really currently find anything new. I think it’s just a great way to explore, and I like seeing that other people have felt the same way about it.”
Some users have expressed that they want to use Discover Together with more than one other person in a group, so Yoon, Reddy and Narang are considering adding that feature. At the moment, one of their future goals is to be acquired by a dating app since they realized that discovering music was a great way to break the ice when meeting someone new for the first time, especially online. 
Discover Together is currently partnered with a Canadian dating app called Aphrodite, which uses artificial intelligence to match people based on things they have in common on a form they fill out, and are currently in talks with matchSC. Reddy said that music was a great way for two people to connect since sometimes it’s hard to talk to people on dating apps. 
“Right now, we want to position ourselves as a feature that dating apps can use for themselves,” Yoon said. “If you go on Tinder, there would be a feature, saying, ‘Oh, do you want to make a playlist?’ or something like that. I know you can see what their favorite artists are and stuff like that, but kind of going a step further does a great job breaking the ice, like ‘hey, did you listen to this song on our playlist?’ That’s the kind of direction we’re taking.” 
Ideally, Reddy hopes that if Discover Together is integrated into a dating app, it will allow partners to find music and make meaningful memories with each other. 
“You would send a request out for someone you’re talking to on Bumble or whatever, make a playlist with them and [Discover Together] will make the playlist you could potentially listen to together, or talk about the song that you like on the playlist,” Reddy said. “If you go on a date to a picnic or something like that, you’d be able to listen to that close together.”
If a Spotify user wants to try out Discover Together without a partner, the service can also be enjoyed by making a playlist with yourself. When Narang was testing out the service, he made playlists with himself and found at least 20 songs that he now listens to regularly, and encourages people to try it out as well — on their own, with a friend or someone they’ve just started talking to. 
“Music is like a universal connector,” Yoon said. “[Discover Together exists] in a great little niche where we can target existing couples so that they can have fun and make a playlist together. The app is kind of intimate, like a one-on-one playlist builder. Also for people just meeting for the first time, it’s a great way to start conversation and talk about music, favorite artists and find new music together.”

The last time that USC defeated Kansas, McDonald’s had just introduced the “Happy Meal” to the public in 1979. Now, head coach Andy Enfield and his squad have a chance to compete against the perennial powerhouse Monday night in the second round of the NCAA Tournament.
The sixth-seeded Trojans took care of business in the first round Saturday, defeating the eleventh-seeded Drake Bulldogs 72-56 despite only leading by three points at halftime. USC held Drake to just 29% shooting on the night, including an abysmal 19% in the second half. The Trojans will have to keep up the defensive pressure on Monday night if they hope to get past the third-seeded Jayhawks.
“We’ve been good all season [on defense], for the most part,” Enfield said. “I know we’ve lost a few games where our defense wasn’t where it needed to be, but tonight it was, and that’s what it takes in this tournament.” 
Freshman forward Evan Mobley has been a major enforcer on the defensive end this season. His ability to be a deterrent at the rim and block shots has forced opponents to launch 3-pointers rather than drive to the paint. In the first round, Drake shot 23 3-pointers and connected on just seven, while Mobley added three blocks to his stats sheet. 
“Mobley, as a freshman, has improved every week and every month of the season,” Enfield said. “He’s learned how to guard physical bigs, he’s learned how to guard athletic bigs, and also guys who have a lot of skills, like shot fakes.”
Mobley will have his hands full on Monday against a well-balanced Jayhawks squad that features four players who averaged double-digit scoring performances in the regular season. The Jayhawks will hope to get freshman forward Jalen Wilson back from coronavirus isolation before the game, as his tenacious rebounding has been imperative for this Kansas team all season. 
Junior forward David McCormack made his return in Kansas’ win against Eastern Washington in the first round after his coronavirus isolation period came to an end. McCormack looked as though he hadn’t missed a beat, finishing the first round game with 22 points. 
“[Kansas is] just exceptional — they have so much talent, they’re so experienced,” Enfield said. They have veterans at different positions. We’ll have to play a great game to have a chance to beat them on Monday.”
Enfield will look to become the first head coach in USC history to win four NCAA tournament games throughout his tenure. It won’t come easy — Kansas has the ability to go on quick runs and leave opponents in the dust.
“It’s going to be a great game, great matchup,” Mobley said. “They’re a great team, we’re a great team, so we’re just going to be locked in and try to get the win.” 
The Trojans will face the Jayhawks Monday night in the Hinkle Fieldhouse in Indianapolis, Ind. The victor will go on to face the winner of the Oregon-Iowa matchup. Tip-off is at 6:40 p.m.

Regardless of which side you’re on, one thing is certain: Political tribalism in the United States needs to end. There has never been so much gridlock in Congress, with both sides refusing to compromise — a notable example being the passing of the recent American Rescue Plan which zero Republicans voted for. There are many causes for this increased disunity; the rise of controversial political figures on both sides, media bias and new political donors, just to name a few. However, there is one cause, political bias at the university level, that hits closest to home. 
There are three main ways universities contribute to political tribalism: biased grading, peer culture and university attitude. Each one is extremely detrimental to the growth of student minds.
First, unfair grading practices are widespread in U.S. universities. All students have experienced a professor a little too proud of their political views. When this happens, students get two choices: to “write to the professor” to match their views or to stand one’s ground and risk a bad grade. Confirmation bias suggests that professors are more likely to discredit or be skeptical of arguments that run against their ideology. This bias makes it hard for them to grade fairly, even if they are not consciously trying to do so. 
Next, peer culture affects the political atmosphere at universities. Some universities, such as University of California, Berkeley and Brown University, are known for having an overwhelmingly liberal student body. For example, Brown has a 60:1 liberal-to-conservative ratio. In contrast, some universities, such as Hillsdale College, are extremely conservative. University of Dallas is a private liberal arts university that has a required Western Civilization course sequence, forcing students to focus on the Western world. Western Civilization courses give students a Eurocentric view of the world, failing to see beyond the United States and Europe. 
When a student enrolls in a university that has drastically opposing views of their own, they may face ostracization and peer pressure to conform to the majority. Especially with the recent increase in the U.S.’s political divide, more and more people are unfriending others for having different political views. This extreme pressure to conform to the norm, especially on college campuses, is unhealthy. Education is about having the intellectual freedom to choose what to think; universities full of peers forcing others to have a particular view are detrimental to personal growth. 
Although universities may not be fully responsible for peer pressure, they are responsible for the polarized university attitudes. Many colleges try to align their views with their students to prevent backlash and scandals. For example, Hillsdale College often appeases its right-wing donors by supporting Republican practices, such as putting up a statue of Margaret Thatcher and Ronald Reagan. 
Some liberal universities make the same mistake; USC, in an attempt to appear socially responsible, often overly tries to appease to liberals. USC professor Greg Patton came under fire for saying a Chinese word that sounded like a slur in English. Although there could be other motivations for this decision, USC is under pressure to act socially responsible, which may affect some of their decisions. The University not only attempted to put up a progressive front but also ended up isolating Chinese students. Colleges’ decisions to appease its allies through political signalling is destructive to students’ education.
Universities often are pressured to respond in liberal or conservative ways to events, creating a general universitywide political attitude. This can isolate those who do not fit in and makes it difficult for students to think independently.
Although universities are only one cause of many to political tribalism, its effects are extensive, as students learn and form their political opinions on college campuses. In turn, students may carry these prejudices and biases for a lifetime. Many elite universities perpetuate biased grading, peer culture and university attitude, and USC is no exception. In college, students should get the intellectual freedom to form their own views from what they learn, not from what their peers think or what their university supports.

Instead of enjoying a delicious Thanksgiving feast together, I dropped off a plate of turkey and mashed potatoes at my grandma’s door. Rather than our usual Christmas morning gift exchange and brunch, my grandpa and I emailed each other “Happy Holidays!” For now, my grandparents and I settle for waves across the street over hugs.
My grandparents are certainly not the only older adults who’ve had a rough year. The coronavirus disrupted the lives of millions of older adults, demolishing daily routines and annual traditions. And, considering volunteer work is a common activity for older adults, the forced confinement to homes detrimentally impacted nonprofits as well. As we return to a post-coronavirus society over the next few years, nonprofits must not only welcome back older adult volunteers but also build stronger relationships with new volunteers as well. 
Older adults are most likely out of any age group to volunteer for 100 hours or more a year, and one in three U.S. volunteers are age 55 or older. In the next 40 years, the number of Americans over the age of 65 is expected to increase from 56 million to almost 95 million. As older adults account for a greater proportion of the population, nonprofits can harness their desire to volunteer to generate a larger volunteer workforce. 
This past year, nonprofits shifted in-person volunteering to a virtual format. While virtual volunteering has been semi-successful thus far, it requires training, technology and know-how not necessary for in-person volunteering. According to Pew Research Center, only 59% of Americans 65 and older have broadband internet connections, which is significantly lower than younger age groups. Additionally, Thomas Kamber, executive director of Older Adults Technology Services, claims that fluency with software applications presents a common hurdle for older adults when using tools like Zoom. 
Although innovative, virtual volunteering is not one-size-fits-all. Post-pandemic, many nonprofits will choose to pivot back to in-person volunteering. As nonprofits (hopefully) make the transition back to in-person work, they can re-energize their efforts to recruit former and new volunteers. 
Older adults provide a stable, reliable volunteer base for nonprofits. In a survey of volunteer program leaders across the Midwestern United States, 61% of respondents said older adults were easier to recruit than younger generations and 76% reported older adults were easier to retain. 
Older adults don’t solely contribute to nonprofits by performing physical tasks — they also bring their unique and valuable perspectives. The majority of volunteer program leaders found that volunteers’ life experiences, skills and “in-depth knowledge of organizational background, history or culture” were a huge advantage for nonprofits. The new generation of nonprofit leaders can learn from the wealth of stories and lessons of older adults. 
Importantly, recruiting older adults to volunteer for nonprofits helps both the organization and the older adults themselves.
Volunteering improves mental health — an especially important benefit post-pandemic. While this past year presented difficulties for everyone, older adults, who are at greater risk of serious illness from the coronavirus, were hit especially hard with isolation and anxiety. In fact, The Kaiser Family Foundation reports that one in four adults aged 65 and older reported anxiety and depression during the pandemic, up from one in 10 in 2018. 
Studies show that volunteering decreases risk of depression, allows older adults to meet new people and helps people stay physically and mentally active. Post-retirement, volunteering creates a renewed sense of purpose for many older adults by allowing them to apply their skills in a way that benefits society. Volunteering offers a valuable opportunity to reestablish a routine and return to normalcy after the pandemic. 
After months of isolation, many older adults will seek connections as they venture back into society. Now is the perfect time to nurture a relationship between older adults and nonprofits. In the Senior Corps, participants said their top motivations to volunteer were “the desire to feel valued and useful” and “the desire to feel vital and physically active.” 
In order to maximize participation, nonprofits need to tune into the motivations behind older adults’ decision to volunteer. For example, nonprofits should promote roles that utilize the skill-sets and knowledge of older adults, rather than simply assigning them busy work. A flexible schedule and mission-driven actions are key to engaging older adults. 
As we head toward a more hopeful future, we must reintegrate older adults through socialization and engagement opportunities. A strengthened relationship between older adults and nonprofits will not only be beneficial for both parties involved but also society as a whole.
