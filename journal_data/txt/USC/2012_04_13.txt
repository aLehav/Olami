@Josephine I don’t believe I’d go quite so far as calling for his replacement, but I do wonder that Nikias has not appeared in any of the photos or issued any statement with his name on it. I would have expected more from him. 
And your point regarding more/better/cheaper housing is a good one. It could also be said that the Master Plan for replacing the UV would lead to better housing, since it does call for something like 2,500 new beds.
Has Max Nikas even shown up for this crisis?  Has he shown any leadership at all?  Is he just hiding in his office and letting others handle it? There are lots of things he could be doing, such as partially subsidizing the building of nice apartments ( possibly high rise) across the street from USC or promising to partially subsidize the rent of graduate students and other students not from wealthy families if developers would build such housing. Let’s face it. Students who can afford to live in Gateway do not get shot, stabbed or assaulted. USC could make things a lot safer for its students but will not spent the money to do so. If Nikas does not act, then he is a failed leader and USC should replace him.

The families of two international graduate students who were fatally shot have been granted visas to travel from China to the United States, said Michael Jackson, vice president for student affairs.
Jackson said the parents and some extended family members of both victims should arrive within the next several days. The director of the Viterbi School of Engineering’s program in Beijing will accompany the families.
Ming Qu, 23, and Ying Wu, 23, were fatally shot at approximately 1 a.m. Wednesday morning while sitting in Qu’s vehicle near the intersection of Raymond Avenue and 27th Street.
Qu’s family lives in the Jilin province of China. His mother is a high school teacher and his father works for an insurance company.
Wu’s family lives in the Hunan province of China. Wu’s father works for a local police department and her mother is retired.
USC is working closely with the Chinese Consulate-General in Los Angeles to communicate with the victims’ families.
“Our focus is on supporting the families,” Jackson said.
Wu and Qu were graduate students studying electrical engineering at Viterbi.
“They were very close friends who supported each other, studied hard in class and formed close bonds and friendships with the faculty at the Viterbi School of Engineering,” Jackson said. “We are deeply sorry they are no longer with us.”
Jackson said an on-campus memorial for Qu and Wu will be planned once the families arrive.
The gunman remains at large. USC is offering $125,000 for information leading to an arrest and conviction in the case. Anyone with information is asked to call the LAPD’s Criminal Gang Homicide Division at (213) 485-4341 or the Detective Information Desk at the 24-hour toll-free number 877-LAPD-24-7.
To Ana Bolanos, I couldn’t agree more. The University should spare no expense to encourage further development near the campus of safe housing. What a horrible crime, and how ridiculous for a University that is trying to raise $6 billion dollars for an endowment, when they can’t even keep our kids safe. I find it frustrating they are about to spend $70 million dollars to open an new center for athletes, but kids are living in sub-Standard housing to attend an expensive private school. How can they stop campus cruisers at 2:45 am? They should have 24 hour a day shuttle service, more security, etc. I don’t care how “safe” the area is now statsitically. Two deaths are too many for a “world class ” University. The damage to USC”s reputation should be far greater than the costs of more security.
Were either Ying or Ming only children? If so, has anyone thought about whether either set of
 parents will need financial help in their old age and who will provide it?
This could happen anywhere, more gun control is needed. 2 people where shot sitting in their truck in Mill Valley today, one of the nicest cities in California, by a motorcyclist. It can happen anywhere.
More video cameras, less guns, and hard sentences for criminals/death penalty for murderers.
This is incredibly tragic. I cannot imagine the depth of grief that the parents feel. I implore USC to provide safer housing for the students. Our daughter will be living off campus next year and we are ambivalent abour allowing her to continue her studies at USC. The safety of the students should be considered paramount. Hire qualified staff that reflect the integrity of USC to protect our children. I understand that off campus security do not make the students feel save.
This is the price Americans have to pay for gun owership. Beside, what if their parents are corrupted officals?

The Los Angeles Police Department and the university held a press conference Friday afternoon to encourage public help in finding the people responsible for the death of two graduate students shot dead early Wednesday morning.
Viterbi School of Engineering graduate students Ming Qu and Ying Wu were fatally shot early Wednesday morning while sitting in Qu’s car near the intersection of Raymond Avenue and 27th Street.
LAPD Deputy Chief Pat Gannon welcomed the media and community, noting the rainy weather of both the press conference and the morning of the murder.
“[The rain] is exactly like the weather that evening, if there is any symbolism to that,” Gannon said.

[Update: 1:22 p.m.] Gannon said detectives will work in the same fashion  that they would to solve all murders. Both the FBI and the LAPD Save Our Streets task force are assigned to the investigation.
It appears that the unknown suspect used a hand gun to fire two or three shots at Qu and Wu through the driver’s window of Qu’s car. The possible suspect was last seen wearing dark clothes running southbound on Raymond Avenue at about the same time a black sedan was leaving the area. The race and gender of the suspect is unknown.
“In the end, successful resolution to this case will only happen with the help of the public,” Gannon said.
[Update: 1:25 p.m.] The area near the 2700 block of Raymond Avenue where the crime took place has seen a decrease in crime by in the past few years, Gannon said. Violent crime is down 50 percent in the last five years.
“This is a great neighborhood. This is a great community. We’ve had a total of three murders in the last five years,” Gannon said.
[Update: 1:32 p.m.] The university has arranged for the Qu and Wu’s families to travel to Los Angeles, and they will be here shortly, said Michael L. Jackson, vice president of student affairs.
Todd Dickey, senior vice president of administration, said the university is offering a $125,000 reward for any information leading to the arrest and conviction of the suspect or suspects.
“[USC] is working in cooperation with the LAPD by offering a reward of $125,000,” Dickey said.
[Update: 1:43] Jacqueline Hamilton said Wu was a determined young woman. She spent a lot of time at the library and enjoyed cooking.
“She was a member of our family,” said Hamilton, Wu’s host mother since June 2011, who has hosted about 25 international students.
Hamilton said she doesn’t know if she can call it dating, but Wu and Qu saw each other frequently and had developed a close relationship.
“I’ve never seen Ying happier than in the last three weeks. They were at that stage in their relationship where they couldn’t bear to be apart,” Hamilton said.
She said she urges people to come forward with information about the murder.
“They were modest students trying to make a life for themselves,” Hamilton said.
[Update: 1:53 p.m.] Gannon said there is property of Qu and Wu’s that is unaccounted for, which could indicate a robbery. He said he cannot disclose information about the property.
There is no evidence that indicates the murder was gang-related, Gannon said. Investigators are not ruling out that more than one person was involved.
When LAPD arrived at the scene, the engine of the Qu’s car was running, the driver’s window of Qu’s car was broken, and all other windows were rolled up.
“I won’t let some idiot with a gun take away from my sense of safety,” Hamilton said. “No one should blame these two people for anything.”
“I’m so grateful to USC for offering up this reward,” Gannon said.
[Update: 1:57 p.m.] Qu and Wu’s parents and some extended family members have received their visas, Jackson said. They will arrive in Los Angeles in a few days.

Yes big time fail with the “award” “reward” mix up
Does the dt have an editor?
Almost didn’t read this important article, because from the title, I thought it was about something else (should be “reward” not “award” in title).
i’m sorry to hear this news.i’m chinese girl.i come from changde.it is same to the killed girl.i feel so sad.one of my friends knows this girl.they live a same  residential district.the girl is very hard-working and smart.i’m really sad.
I have sent in my declination. 
My parents decided this is too rough a neighborhood. I am torn, but that is that.
Bummmmmer
Never let crime and the malice of others dictate your life. That’s what they prey upon. Be strong and FIGHT ON! Come to USC!
What a terrible story! 
These 2 people lost their lives because some thug wanted their things! 
Truly senseless and scary!
I need to reevaluate about going to USC.
You are right, it is a tragic and senseless murder of 2 young people trying to get ahead in life the right way, by studying hard and going to a great school.  If you were accepted to USC it shows that you are at the top of your class and have undoubtedly have been accepted to several other top universities.  The actions of the thug(s) that have committed this heinous crime should alert all of us of the community just outside the “safety zone” of USC but not necessarily rule out attending this great university.  USC is completely aware of its surroundings and has implemented several extensive security systems.  Unfortunately this happened just outside of it but it appears that the school has set up safety kiosks and guards further out to include that area.  My child is a student at USC and of course, I am concerned about her safety,  but I would have the same concerns wherever she would be attending school.

We don’t seem to know how we like them. With contemporary female artists, there seems be a spectrum of innocence and promiscuousness, and we sort of like to put a singer on one end or the other. The good girl charms us into adoration, while the bad girl shocks us until we find ourselves listening to her music just for the explicit lyrics.
2012 seems to bring more of the same.
With the release of her music video “You Da One” about three months ago, Rihanna has solidified her place as dance-pop’s bad girl. She grabs her crotch and rubs her hands over her body repeatedly, taking the seemingly innocent lyrics My love is your love/ Your love is mine and distorting them into something much more vulgar. Even though this behavior from Rihanna is almost expected today —she’s known for her “S&M” antics and for openly seeking trouble with Chris Brown in “Birthday Cake”— it’s important to remember that, when she debuted in 2005, she was hardly so promiscuous. Songs like “If It’s Loving That You Want” and, later, even “Unfaithful” show a toned-down but sexually confident Rihanna. But somehow, in between the release of Good Girl Gone Bad and Rated R, her image shifted completely, moving her from one end of the spectrum to another.
The opposite is true for pop superstar Katy Perry. When she appeared on the mainstream music scene in 2008 with “I Kissed A Girl” and “Ur So Gay,” fans expected her to teasingly challenge female constraints and sexual norms; if she wasn’t quite a bad girl, she was certainly more loose and unafraid than her contemporaries. But since then, Perry has mellowed out. Though she’s certainly not as innocent as Taylor Swift, the flawless good girl of the country-pop industry, she’s definitely not as flamboyant (at least lyrically) as she originally was. While “E.T” might give a flashback into Perry’s early days with a little sci-fi weirdness, songs like “California Girls,” “Teenage Dream” and 2012’s “Part of Me” harbor more of the generic comfort of a song that is catchy but safe. If we’re talking about growth, Perry, though highly successful, hasn’t really moved in the expected direction.
Still, even with the achievements of extreme artists like Rihanna and Lady Gaga or more comfortable talents like Katy Perry and Taylor Swift, the highest amount of success seems to belong to those who can strike a comfortable balance between the good and bad, the chaste and promiscuous.
Beyoncé Knowles, for example, who has a total of 16 Grammy Awards, six of which are for her third solo album, I Am…Sasha Fierce, seems to have mastered this. The entire theme of Sasha Fierce revolves around B’s duality; disc one features slower, more vulnerable jams, while disc two features up-tempo, party songs. But even outside of her third album, Beyoncé maintains her classy but sexy image. Her 2003 songs “Naughty Girl” and “Yes,” balance each other out, while 2011 4’s “Dance For You” and “Love On Top” position Beyoncé as neither good girl nor bad, but someone independently in between.
The same holds true for country music icon Carrie Underwood. Though Underwood can destroy her ex’s car in “Before He Cheats” and complain about the late-night behaviors of a “Cowboy Casanova,” she can also demonstrate her spirituality in “Jesus, Take the Wheel” and show a little girl-next-door charm in “All-American Girl.” Her latest single “Good Girl” seems to build on that dual image. In the video, Underwood switches between a black catsuit with a garter belt and an innocent, floor-length floral dress, highlighting her ability to balance delicately between two worlds.
To be fair, there’s nothing wrong with being one way or the other. But given the success of some artists who don’t seek to define themselves as good or bad, perhaps such strict roles and representations are not necessary for those who know how to produce good music.

Quentin Tarantino fans can rejoice: we finally get a taste of his upcoming feature Django Unchained.
Starring Leonardo DiCaprio, Jamie Foxx, Kerry Washington, Samuel L. Jackson and 2011 Academy Award winner Christoph Waltz, Tarantino’s ninth film is set to be released Christmas Day 2012.
Foxx will play a freed slave named Django who travels across the South with Waltz in search of his wife, played by Kerry Washington. In a dramatic change of pace, DiCaprio has been cast as the antagonist, a sadistic slave owner.
The recently released poster is simple: two silhouettes, presumably Waltz and Foxx underneath a broken chain. Evoking the spirit of classic Spaghetti Westerns, Tarantino has stated that the upcoming film is a love letter of sorts to iconic filmmaker Sergio Leone.
Although some are skeptical over how Tarantino will treat such a sensitive topic – this is the man, after all, who rewrote World War II – chances are Django Unchained will be another creative masterpiece for Tarantino to call his own.
Love ‘em or hate ‘em, one must admit that Tarantino is completely original in his vision. And in a world of cookie-cutter and mundane films, such originality is welcome – no matter how crazy it might be.
