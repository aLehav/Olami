While most students and faculty are away from campus in adherence to social distancing guidelines, researchers at the USC Center for ImmunoEngineering laboratory are one of the few exceptions to that rule. 
The researchers work for nearly three hours every day, performing trials to develop a vaccine to treat the coronavirus. Led by Pin Wang, a Zohrab A. Kaprielian Fellow in Engineering, the lab uses engineering tools to research the immune system.
The team of researchers, including three doctoral students, began designing the vaccine in February after realizing the severity of the coronavirus spread in China, said Wang, a Viterbi School of Engineering professor of chemical engineering. After realizing the effect the virus may have globally, Wang’s team mobilized its efforts to engineer a hybrid virus last month when the pandemic outbreak intensified in Los Angeles County.
“We have already designed the direction and structure and have already [been] in the process of making [a vaccine],” Wang said. “It became apparent that [the pandemic] will become a major problem in the U.S., particularly in California, and that’s when we start to really pick up the work.”
Wang said the vaccine has relied on engineering a hybrid virus that contains spike proteins, a protein on the surface of the cell membrane, from the coronavirus. Since the hybrid virus can produce antibodies against the virus, helping human bodies recognize and attack the virus, it can be used as a vaccine.  
Next month, the team of researchers plans to conduct an animal study, where they will first place the hybrid virus in a mouse to test the virus effectiveness in inducing an immune system response that includes the production of antibodies. Later, the team may perform testing on other animals to further determine the hybrid virus’ effectiveness. Wang said the team is still in the process of making the hybrid virus and hasn’t done much testing yet.
 “[We need] to, first of all, validate the viral system,” Wang said. “Secondly we need to, more importantly, test the immunogenicity of this viral vector [hybrid virus], which means it has to be tested and dependable.” 
Wang said inducing antibodies is a sophisticated process, and the team chose the approach as a last resort in case developing a vaccine is unfeasible for other institutions working on other vaccines. Vaccines with inactive or weakened coronavirus viruses, which immunize against the virus without infecting the host, are in the process of human testing in China and the United States. 
“We don’t know how easy the [coronavirus] vaccine is going to [develop],” Wang said. “If it’s easy, then we probably do not need such a sophisticated [method], but if it turns out that other [vaccines] don’t work out very well, then [our vaccine] would be very important for backup.” 
Xianhui Chen, a graduate student studying pharmaceutical sciences and one of the doctoral student researchers, said her responsibilities performing experiments in the lab include rotating daily with her co-workers to follow social distancing guidelines and meeting online each day to discuss what researchers accomplished the day before, any issues that arose from experiments and updates regarding next steps in their research plan.                                               
“Our lab has the virus platform that we have established for years, so it can be convenient and efficient for us to step into vaccine development,” Chen said.
When Chen was invited to join Wang’s research team mid-March she said she immediately accepted since she wished to contribute to finding a cure for the virus. Chen also said that before joining the team, she volunteered at the U.S.-China Health Summit to learn about ongoing research involving the pandemic March 1 including the development of drugs for treatment and prevention measures. 
“As scientists we always want to help with the [pandemic] situation to change it, to improve it,” Chen said. “The best way that we can contribute is through our expertise, knowledge and experience in this field.”
Yun Qu, a doctoral student part of the research team studying chemical engineering, has worked in Wang’s immunoengineering research lab for four years, so she was familiar with the techniques used to develop the vaccine, which include using viral vectors to deliver material into cells, before joining Wang’s vaccine research. Qu said she finds comfort in performing the same procedures but on a more impactful scale.
“It feels good to still be able to go to the lab every day and continue working, especially working for this project that can actually make a difference, make an impact to the current situation,” Qu said. 
Wang said he has been working with vaccines and the immune system for more than 15 years and considers the vaccine essential to controlling the coronavirus’ spread and ending the pandemic.
“We all recognize eventually to combat [the coronavirus] and trying to make everyone get [back] to normal life, the vaccine is essential,” Wang said. “We feel like this is important, and we are trying to do our best.”

Every generation has its directors. The ’70s got Martin Scorsese, Francis Ford Coppola and Brian De Palma. The ’80s had John Hughes, Tim Burton and Robert Zemeckis. ’90s kids got Quentin Tarantino, both Andersons (Paul Thomas and Wes) and David Fincher. The turn of the century found many of these masters making some of their best work, while a new generation of filmmakers also began to create. Growing up in the 21st century, while we are privileged to stream the work of classic directors, there are plenty of voices that are unique to our time, our generation. 
In the following columns, I will briefly study one contemporary director who is actively defining our cinematic era. Most of these filmmakers began working in the 2010s, only some of them started in the aughts. Still, the names I will study are shaping our current movie culture. They inspire the filmmakers and critics among us, so I think it’s worth spending a little time getting to know them.
In 2009, Damien Chazelle premiered his debut film at the Tribeca Film Festival. “Guy and Madeline on a Park Bench” was originally Chazelle’s undergraduate thesis film, but he paused his Harvard education to complete it. The film was a critical darling, mainly because it is such a blatant homage to past masters like John Cassavetes and Jean-Luc Godard — and critics love when they can flex their knowledge and point this stuff out. 
Even in this short debut, the young Chazelle announced his ambitions to the world. He immediately sought to blend two seemingly unblendable genres: the realist drama and the musical. “Guy and Madeline” owes its look and themes to both MGM musicals and black-and-white street films. It’s as if Chazelle couldn’t pick a side. Musicals are marked by a spontaneous song break from the narrative, so how do you fit that into a realist sensibility? In his subsequent musical pictures, Chazelle makes music indispensable to his plot, but every compromise comes with some sort of loss. 
“Whiplash” (2013) and “La La Land” (2016) brought Chazelle to the fore. Both are about musical obsession — the former is harsher, of course. “Whiplash” finds Chazelle still showing off. The obvious time-signature editing, the camera whizzing across the stage during every musical number — it was all there in “Guy and Madeline” — but give a director a higher budget and he will make sure you see what he’s doing with it. 
Yet, Chazelle was never going to stay solely in the foul-mouthed world of “Whiplash” and its love-hate relationship with jazz. “La La Land” allowed him to explore the more joyful side of musical filmmaking. It’s probably the film he’ll be most known for and it’s also the one that’s most open to critique.
“La La Land” is a remake. Actually, a remake of two films: Scorsese’s “New York, New York” (1977) and Jacques Demy’s “The Umbrellas of Cherbourg” (1964). The ambitious Chazelle again crams his cinematic obsessions into one vehicle; the full-blown musical form takes up so much oxygen, it leaves little room for the titular characters to have a full life of their own.
In “La La Land,” Chazelle forces his characters into a musical. Unlike the leads in Scorsese’s and Demy’s films, Seb (Ryan Gosling) and Mia (Emma Stone) are not musical characters; they’re too awkward and their personalities are not big enough. Chazelle tries to transplant some of the realistic, mumblecore aesthetic of “Guy and Madeline” to “La La Land,” but it doesn’t translate. Even in his student film, Chazelle made easier transitions between plot and song. 
In “La La Land,” the awkward, quirky Mia and Seb are forced into song and dance. They share a painfully awkward exchange as they walk up the hill before “A Lovely Night.” So why do they suddenly burst into a tap dance? Yes, the whole point of a musical is that real life doesn’t just break out into song, but “La La Land” makes a clear point to erase the line between fantasy and reality (Mia actually changes into tap shoes right before the song). It is asking us to be on board with spontaneous songs, but the musical numbers exist primarily for our fun, not the characters’ expression. It’s delightful, of course, but it’s borderline gratuitous. 
Again, Chazelle is showing off. His hand is very present in the narrative — he clearly orchestrates everything from John Legend’s timely entrance to the number of people that attend Mia’s one-woman show. This is not a bad thing. It’s just that I’d like to see what would happen if he would’ve loosened his grip on Mia and Seb. 
Every generation of directors pays tribute to the past masters; Chazelle is so overt about his influences, I see him as a younger, brighter Tarantino. Yet, while Tarantino’s films show his cinephilia to be quite mature, Chazelle’s films prove his obsession needs to gestate a little. This is why his 2018 film “First Man” is better than “La La Land;” its committed aesthetic bolsters its characters, never smothering their personalities. In “First Man,” Chazelle lets his characters speak more than him.
The defining mark of Chazelle’s films is obsession. His characters are all obsessed with success, with living up to some standard of greatness. This is also why “First Man” is so interesting: Instead of showing someone vying for notoriety, Chazelle shows, in his rendition of Neil Armstrong (Gosling), someone already in the spotlight; he takes us behind closed doors to experience what the history books could never show. Andrew (Miles Teller) in “Whiplash,” Mia and Seb all shoot for the moon and their stories end with them at the top. “First Man” takes us to the moon with Neil and brings us back. We close on a quiet scene — as all Chazelle’s movies do — with two people exchanging a look. 
After conquering the moon, conquering his obsession, the astronaut has a tender moment with his wife. Reaching the top wouldn’t matter if he didn’t come back to Earth a different, better person. Here, more than in his previous films, the ending is earned. Less definite, but more graceful. 
I personally hope Chazelle’s future pictures will focus less on the exhilarating ride to the moon and more on the way back.

In the wake of the coronavirus pandemic, cultural events have found a way to continue despite their venues being closed. On Friday, producer and director Brando Crawford brought live theater online with a reading of “This is Our Youth.” 
Written by Kenneth Lonergan in 1996, the play is a glimpse into the lives of young adults in New York’s Upper West Side as they deal drugs, debate over stolen money and navigate romance. Actors Florence Pugh, Alex Wolff and Justice Smith came together via a livestreamed Zoom session Friday for a read-through of the two-hour-long play.
The read-through was produced by Acting for a Cause, an initiative started by Crawford in high school that was eventually disbanded due to creative differences between Crawford and his partners. After the outbreak, Crawford resurrected the initiative to fundraise for families and students in need. 
“Fifty percent of the profits are going to go directly to families with someone who has coronavirus directly impacting them … and 50% of the profits are going to go to students on the west side of Chicago with financial need,” Crawford said during the play’s intermission as he encouraged viewers to donate. 
Even with a star-studded cast and noble premise, the play inevitably lost the energy of live theater. The actors did not print out the script, instead relying on an online version that twice disappeared due to connectivity issues. These technical issues butchered the flow of the play with one pause occurring halting the intensity of a climactic fight scene. The fourth wall was also broken during the read-through as Wolff apologized to his scene partners and livestream viewers explaining that his script quit out. 
Pugh was expectedly brilliant in her portrayal of Jessica Goldman with a stellar American accent. But Smith was the standout of the show, as he brought a stark duality to his character Dennis Ziegler. During the first act, Smith excelled at playing the hostile yet aimless drug dealer primarily concerned with buying coke and selling his friend’s vintage toy collection. 
Smith’s talent also shined in the second act, as he performed a monologue in the wake of his friend’s death about mortality, his friend’s life and family, all while he contemplated calling his angry girlfriend in search of any source of comfort. Smith was emotionally engaged, and his words were spoken with intent, creating a truly memorable final performance.
Wolff’s performance of Warren Straub left something to be desired. Warren is a frantic, needy and initially unlikable character. As the play explores the death of his sister and abusive relationship with his father, audiences are supposed to feel bad for him and eventually justify his erratic behavior. However, due to a lack of prep time and character work, Wolff’s portrayal was shallow and uninspired. He lacked the vulnerability needed to provoke empathy from the audience, which is necessary for Warren’s character development. 
Overall, the read-through provided an entertaining afternoon for viewers who tuned in. The shortcomings of the production were ultimately understandable, as embarrassing technical issues are universal experiences. Acting for a Cause made an effort to keep the arts alive and share them for free, all while raising $1,550.

The 20th anniversary of the Coachella Music and Arts Festival was set to kick off this past weekend. But with the show rescheduled to October, we are left with the feature-length documentary: “Coachella: 20 Years in the Desert,” dubbed“ Couchella” by Twitter users as they tune in from their homes instead of from the festival grounds in Coachella Valley. The YouTube Original premiered on the platform April 10 at noon, the exact moment when the festival doors would’ve opened. 
If you are a music fan of any kind, this is a must-watch. 
From the start, the documentary immerses viewers in multiple genres of music and legendary performances from different decades with never-before-seen footage of the yearly cultural phenomenon. It gives viewers a behind-the-scenes look at the festival’s humble beginnings and initial struggles to establish itself.
It was particularly fascinating to watch the festival transition over time as popular culture changed. Dispersed throughout the documentary are old concert film and audio clips from the past two decades, making viewers fall in love with the festival’s earlier days. The documentary not only marks Coachella’s changes — moving from punk band and indie rocker performances to EDM, rap and hip hop — but changes in the wider music culture as well. 
The film’s approach to telling the story of co-founders Paul Tollett and Rick Van Santen is energetic, fast-paced and combines the perfect amount of drama with joy — reflective of the experience at the real Coachella. Unexpected was the massive growth and notoriety the festival garnered with the world’s most famous artists, such as Beyonce, eventually headlining. Through interviews with producers, musical icons and more, we not only see the evolution of Coachella but are also placed in its early years with inaugural headliners Rage Against the Machine and Beck. 
At its best, “Coachella: 20 Years in the Desert” is a lesson on how some of the festival’s most monumental performances came together. One of those performances is 2012’s Tupac hologram. The documentary goes into how the festival conceived and produced 3D hologram technology while also respecting the artist’s family and fans. American DJ Gregg Gillis, who goes by the stage name Girl Talk, spoke on how the experience was emotionally complex for fans struggling to decipher whether they should be celebrating Tupac’s life or mourning his death. Other interesting trivia and tidbits in the documentary include a look into Kanye West’s Sunday Service from Easter 2019. We find out that his human-made mountain stage was created in only two weeks. 
There’s a certain romance the real-life experience Coachella gives music fans, providing them with a sense of community. “Coachella: 20 Years in the Desert” excels in recreating the shared experience among Coachella-goers in a new format as everyone is social distancing or quarantining in their homes.  
With “Coachella: 20 Years in the Desert,” you’ll relive some of the festival’s best moments and see exclusive footage of past performances by legends such as Madonna and Prince, along with more recent performances by Tyler, the Creator, Travis Scott and Beyonce. For anyone who had tickets to Coachella this year or is feeling nostalgic, “Coachella: 20 Years in the Desert” is a reminder of the festival’s cult-like allure.

My toes went numb as I stood in a sea of activists holding “Women’s Rights Are Human Rights” and “Respect My Existence or Expect Resistence” posters at the third annual Women’s March in Washington D.C. in 2020, but the cold didn’t bother me as I listened to speakers shout for climate change reform, sexual assault prevention and pro-choice policies.
It was the same energy surge I felt (albeit not as chilly) while marching through downtown Los Angeles the year before, and while the annual protests have lost momentum and attendance numbers since the first one following President Donald Trump’s inauguration in January 2017, looking out at the thousands who did show up gave me power.
Small cities in my area had their own versions of the Women’s March, and I know there are folks in my small Pennsylvania town who believe in the same policies, practices and ideas that I do. But on the one occasion in high school when I explained my pro-choice rights stance to my American history class during a presentation about the sexual revolution, another student texted me later to let me know that he and his friends spent their lunch period discussing how stupid I sounded. 
I kept myself out of any policy debates from that point forward, but when I saw women flood the streets around the world in 2017 to mark one of the largest single-day protests in U.S. history, I couldn’t wait to head to L.A. or Washington D.C. and stand shoulder-to-shoulder with people who felt empowered to shout the beliefs I held inside. 
In these past few weeks of social distancing, I’ve been reminiscing on moments like those and thinking about the women who paved the path for me to live at a time surrounded by so many female activists, policymakers, doctors, business executives and innovators who inspire me to become a better advocate for myself and others.
In 1833, Oberlin College was the first higher education institution to open its doors to men and women, and today, women comprise 56% of all college students. It has been 100 years since women in the U.S. gained the right to vote through the 19th Amendment thanks to suffragettes such as Ida B. Wells and Susan B. Anthony, and it has been 50 years since the Food and Drug Administration approved a pill commissioned by Margaret Sanger that allowed women to decide when they had children. 
Lawmakers and the Supreme Court made decisions in that timeline that declared women had the constitutional right to an abortion and deserved to be paid the same as men for working similar jobs. Supreme Court Justice Sandra Day O’Connor, astronaut Sally Ride, former U.S. Attorney General Janet Reno, former Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi, former Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton and many other women became the first to hold titles previously claimed by men. 
But there’s still so much advocacy that needs to be done. The right to a safe abortion is constantly threatened through harsher state laws and court decisions, including recent measures in states deeming abortions elective, and therefore not necessary, during the coronavirus pandemic. 
Nationwide paid family leave policies should be passed to equalize caregiving responsibilities between both parents and allow men and women equal footing in the workplace. The Violence Against Women Act, which expired in February 2019, must be reenacted to improve responses to domestic violence, a crime that has risen worldwide since people were forced to quarantine inside unsafe homes. 
We must also learn from the mistakes of the activists before us, who fought movements that excluded underrepresented groups. While mainly revered as crusaders for women’s rights, Susan B. Anthony, Elizabeth Cady Stanton and other white suffragettes opened their movement to Black men and women until there were talks of a 15th Amendment, which guaranteed Black men the right to vote. Stanton and other suffragettes, quickly forgetting that abolitionists such as Frederick Douglass helped them grow their movement, opposed the amendment, claiming that granting Black men voting rights first would degrade white women’s social standing. 
Today, white feminism and the divides it creates within the movement still hinder progress. Rachel Cargle, an activist and academic, wrote in Harper’s Bazaar that when she tried to rally feminist activists to get more media attention and questioning when a white man murdered a young Black woman unprovoked, she said she was met with defensiveness from white feminists who listed off other things they had done to help Black people. 
I also learned not too long after leaving the Washington D.C. Women’s March that organizers from Black Lives Matter chapters in L.A., Washington D.C., Houston and Chicago said they were excluded from the event in their cities despite being major community activists who have spoken to the needs of Black men and women in their cities. 
It seems impossible to just stand for women’s rights and not take into account or try to educate oneself on the needs of other underrepresented groups and make sure activists who identify with those groups have a seat at the table. 
While events like the Women’s March marked major milestones for activists around the world and helped young women like me find a voice within the movement, it’s also important to call others out (no matter how powerful or popular they are) when their feminism excludes certain people. If this divide between toxic white feminists — even those who claim to hold intersectional views — persists, the progress we so desperately need to give women and other underrepresented groups will never come to fruition.

Campus turned into a ghost town within a matter of weeks, but USC employees have remained active since student activities grounded to a halt. While the University has taken great precautions to keep faculty and staff at home amid increasing coronavirus concerns, it takes a village to run USC’s 226-acre University Park Campus, and each job carries its own set of challenges. 
From Trader Joe’s staff to USC Housing employees to IT security workers, many employees that work at the University are making sacrifices to keep the University body housed, fed and connected to services like healthcare and internet access. 
Many Trader Joe’s employees fear they will contract the virus despite social distancing measures implemented by the chain. The store currently restricts hours during restocking periods and only serves “senior customers” and “customers with disabilities who may need special assistance” during the first hour of operation, but cashiers greet a steady stream of shoppers throughout their shift — likely coming into contact with carriers of the virus. 
Some USC Housing staff carry spray bottles with disinfectant for the same reason, and residence halls now require students still living on campus to use face recognition technology upon entering instead of scanning their fingerprint. Despite these precautions, many essential workers who cannot work from home fear that increased sanitation may not be enough to keep the virus at bay. 
Medical professionals like those at Keck Medicine of USC work around the clock to provide healthcare to the Los Angeles community, and IT workers work long hours to prevent Zoom-bombings and maintain internet security, according to employees. With little idea as to how long these circumstances will last, the University and administrators serve important roles in adapting institution operations to online formats seamlessly and communicating policy changes effectively.
As of April 8, all non-essential USC staff unable to complete work from home became entitled to paid administrative leave through May 13 — but that period will end, leaving spring semester employees uncertain about their summer employment. This policy is an improvement however upon the actions of  L.A. County, which issued eligible employees two weeks of paid administrative leave and up to 12 weeks’ reduced emergency paid sick leave under the Emergency Paid Sick Leave Act. Both frameworks excel in comparison to Trader Joes’ token employee bonuses and extended sick time reviewed on a case-by-case basis through April 15.  
Non-essential workers who cannot perform their roles online will soon find themselves in a dire predicament: stay home and keep their families safe and face financial hardship or use sick time off in hopes that they will be able to return to recover their losses. 
Meanwhile, non-essential student workers unable to work from home are able to log their hours and receive normal pay beyond the two-week pay period. This is helpful for students who receive financial aid through work-study, but it makes little sense that the barista at a shuttered coffee kiosk should struggle to receive income while students who normally do their homework behind department reception desks still get full pay. 
In an ideal world, both groups of employees would receive compensation during this period of upheaval. If that outcome is not possible, USC may need to reconsider who is receiving compensation and move forward with more utilitarian measures. Additionally, students must take time to acknowledge essential workers on campus and overtaxed employees off campus. They ought to remain informed by reading their emails regularly, and they should stay positive by taking care of themselves as well as thanking those around them. 
The community has entered a period that requires patience, both on behalf of professionals and their clients. Campus is not dead, and its staff continue to face new challenges that should not go unnoticed.

In recent weeks, heroism has been on full display across the country. From doctors flying to the epicenters of the coronavirus pandemic to treat patients to governors and local officials desperately trying to inform the public and save lives, demonstrations of bravery have not been hard to come by. 
Recent weeks also saw heroism, or at least an incredibly heroic campaign, breathe its final breath when Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders announced that he would be suspending his campaign for president. 
In light of this occurrence, I’d like to add some much-needed levity to this column and reference what is indisputably one of the greatest films of all time: “The Dark Knight.” 
Sanders was not the hero that sports deserved, but the hero that sports needed. 
Please put your pitchforks and tiki torches down and just hear me out. I’m not some millennial Marxist recklessly using a sports column as a platform to spread my leftist leanings to the farthest corners of sports fandom. I’m simply trying to tell it like it is. 
Say what you will about Medicare for All, free college or Castro-era literacy programs, but when it comes to sports alone — that singular unifying aspect of American life that both coastal elites and red-state rednecks can bond over— Sanders was your man. 
For some candidates, it was an Ivy League-level education that informed their worldview. For others, it was a personal trauma suffered or injustice endured. For Sanders, it was a bit of both — Sanders attended the University of Chicago and his family struggled to pay his mother’s medical bills. But perhaps more than anything, it was baseball that made him the groundbreaking politician that he is today. 
“I don’t want to tell you that was the sole reason that I’ve developed the politics that I’ve developed,” he said in an interview with The New York Times last January. “But as a kid, I did see in that case … the greed of one particular company. And that impacted me.”
Yes. You heard right. Sanders’ brand of democratic socialism, frequently and falsely compared by the American Right to foreign dictatorships in Venezuela and North Korea, is in fact all-American. 
To add some context, in the quote above, Sanders is referring to a horrific, arguably tragic development of his childhood: the moment the Brooklyn Dodgers betrayed the trust of fans like Sanders and left the outer boroughs of New York for the sunny, palm tree-lined pastures of Los Angeles.
The decision to move was made in 1957, after New York City’s de facto emperor of land development Robert Moses rejected Dodgers’ owner Walter O’Malley’s plans to build a larger, more profitable stadium. 
O’Malley decided to move his team to Los Angeles after the rejection. To this day, assigning blame in the decision has been controversial, but by and large, fans like Sanders still feel their hometown team was stripped from their neighborhood for the sole pursuit of profit. 
To this day, Sanders considers O’Malley’s decision one of the worst moments of his life, and in the decades since, Sanders, now 62 years older, has transformed into a political champion of sorts — a champion for universal health care, a political revolution and, you guessed it, baseball. 
This fall, the Professional Baseball Agreement is set to expire. The PBA governs the relationship between baseball’s major and minor leagues. MLB’s top brass views the agreement’s expiration as an opportunity to save money by giving 42 minor league teams the axe. 
Sanders has been one of the most vocal critics of MLB’s plan, arguing that baseball is a social institution and that minor league teams play a key role in bringing together their local communities. 
Like sports fans across the country, Sanders appreciates the merits of having a local team. He recognizes sports’ ability to forge communities among the most disparate of Americans and knows all too well the pain of losing that kind of community. 
Never mind the fact that the MLB is a federally protected enterprise that scored $1.2 billion in profit just last year. If you’re Joe Sixpack, do you really want to see your local minor league ball club get canned just so the Yankees can hand out some fatter contracts? If you’re a young ballplayer trying to make it one day in the majors, do you want to see your chances evaporate just so some rich owner can get his rocks off to some more cash?
In an era when the NFL prioritizes profits over players’ health and the NBA finds itself in a Faustian bargain with the PRC, Sanders is fighting the good fight, defending baseball and the interests of its fans and young players against the corporate behemoth that is MLB.
For that, we should be thankful for what the senator has done. Sanders’ campaign might not have been your cup of tea, but at the end of the day, he fought for the working man, for the downtrodden and forgotten and for sports fans everywhere, he fought for baseball.
