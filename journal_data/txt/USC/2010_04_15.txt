A growing number of local housing owners are using incentives to entice students to sign leases, and many cite the economy as the primary reason for the recent trend.
Bonus · A number of area housing companies, including University Gateway, offer students incentives for signing a lease. - Hide Kurokawa | Daily Trojan 
“It’s a marketing tool that is used to get people in the door,” said Tommie McCaster, a leasing professional at University Gateway Apartments. “The economy is not what it used to be.”
Students who sign a lease with Gateway are being offered a number of perks. The company is offering to waive the $500 security deposit and the $30 application fee and, until Saturday, is reducing the price of rent from $1,064 per month to $985 per month. Students also receive $200 if they refer a friend who signs a lease.
First Choice Housing, which owns several properties in the North University Park area, also offers students incentives to try to get them through the door.
Currently, First Choice is offering two tickets to a Lakers game when students lease a unit with three or more bedrooms. Students who lease a six-bedroom house get four tickets. Only a limited number of tickets are available, however, and First Choice hopes this will encourage students to act fast.
“We feel that, in today’s economy, students and parents need that little lift. I have noticed that prior to the incentives, students were more indecisive,” said Mehread Koupai, a senior asset manager at First Choice Housing.
First Choice Housing has also rolled back rates to its 2007 rental prices, Koupai noted, and students who sign 11- or 12-month leases are given two weeks of free rent.
“We’ve seen a tremendous response with the incentives,” he said.
Not all housing companies see a need to reward students for leasing with them, however.
“We never need to give away incentives,” said Paul Tennan, executive manager at CDI Management, which owns properties such as The Spot and The Tower. “I don’t believe we’ve ever done a giveaway in direct correlation to signing a lease, but there’s always the need to advertise.”
Tennan added that he thinks prospective renters care more about the facilities than about extra incentives.
“Students see how clean and well-kept our facilities are, and they either want to sign a lease or they don’t,” Tennan said. “If they get value via price or amenities, they’re more inclined to sign.”
Instead of trying to draw in more students, CDI focuses more on tenant appreciation, Tennan said. He noted that CDI frequently does giveaways for tenants, offering items such as movie passes, dinner at L.A. Live restaurants and iPods.
Stephanie Camcho, officer manager at STUHO Student Housing, said STUHO follows the same philosophy, catering toward current rather than prospective renters. STUHO has a referral program that gives students a discount for referring a new tenant, but it doesn’t offer a specific incentive for signing a lease.
Though some students appreciate the incentives, others said they are unnecessary.
“Gateway was the first place I wanted to live, and the incentives in no way, shape or form affected my desire to live there,” said Meghan Mahowald, a freshman majoring in popular music performance. “When I signed the lease, they gave you either a gift card or a bike, and I saw that as unnecessary. Money is already an issue, and it seems wasteful to be giving away such expensive things.”
Mahowald said she would rather see lower rent prices than leasing incentives.
For housing operators, however, leasing incentives are just one more way to get noticed.
“It’s really to increase visibility,” McCaster said. “We want people informed about our housing and our incentives.”
Free rent is definitely a nice incentive, but given the option of living at home (if you are somewhat nearby) versus renting an apartment, living at home has many more perks.  Apartments near campus are not what they seem to be when you’re signing the lease. Recently I found out that a lot of other USC students have felt the same way.  There is this new site called Student Survivors (studentsurvivors.com) for USC students that allows students to read and write reviews for several apartments and companies near campus. I advise any of you looking for housing next year, or those who would like to vent or say good things, to visit the site.  I wish I had known about it when I was living near campus. Its almost like the old Senate Course Guide if any of you remember that.

The national 2010 census is beginning to wind down, but USC is just beginning its effort to make sure students are counted.
Census workers arrived on campus Wednesday, setting up shop at customer service centers in USC Housing facilities on and off campus where they’ll be working 12-hour shifts until April 20.
Making it count · USC Housing is working with the Census Bureau to make sure that as many students are counted as possible. Students are supposed to fill out the census in Los Angeles. - Larry Lin | Daily Trojan 
USC Housing sent campus-wide e-mails Monday informing students about the census and why it’s important for them to participate. Students living in dorms are being instructed to pick up their forms in the Customer Service Center lobby and return them to housing staff. Although some students living off campus received their forms in the mail, others received the forms from R.A.s on their floor.
The university and the Census Bureau are making a special effort to make sure students are represented because they are a traditionally undercounted group, said Sandra Alvarado, a spokesperson for the Census Bureau.
“Students are harder to count,” she said, looking at a map showing return rates for areas across Los Angeles. USC’s 90007 zip code had a return rate of 30 percent.
“That’s really low,” Alvarado said. “Right outside in the neighborhoods is 43 to 46 percent. Nationwide, the current rate is 60 percent.”
Alvarado said it is important that students fill out their forms where they live to attend school, not at their family homes.
“We’ve been doing a lot of outreach to community leaders and hit up some of the campuses with presentations and materials,” she said. “Students should be counted where they live for most of the time. We just want to make sure college students are informed about the process, so we don’t double count.”
Although some students were confused about the process, others found it was relatively painless.
“There were a zillion signs talking about the census,” said Allison Dorr, a sophomore majoring in international relations, who filled out the forms in Fluor Tower. “And L.A. needs the money, so I might as well.”
Leah Mireles, a sophomore majoring in international relations who works in housing, was handing out forms and checking off students’ names on a list. She said many students had already filled out the forms.
“A lot of people have come,” she said. “There was a line where I live.”
Mireles said she wasn’t sure the census effort would reach all the students at USC.
“I think it would be almost impossible to set out to do it, but we have signs and we’re trying to get as many people as possible,” she said.
But Maria Rico, a census worker on campus, said they would not stop trying until they had contacted every student.
“If we’re missing someone, we have to call them back,” she said.
Alvarado said students reluctant to complete the census should think about the impact it would have on their community and the services they want to see 10 years from now. Because of undercounting in the 2000 census, she said, not enough money is given to Los Angeles today.
“Ten years ago, we didn’t count everybody, 20 years ago the same, and now we’re paying the price,” she said.

Swim with Mike, an annual swim-a-thon that raises money for the USC Physically Challenged Athletes Scholarship Fund, celebrates its 30th anniversary this weekend.
Swim with Mike originally started as a way to raise funds to create scholarships for individuals who had suffered serious accidents or illnesses and wanted to attend USC. Since 1999, however, Swim with Mike has significantly expanded nationally, now granting scholarships to students around the country.
Initially titled Swim for Mike, Swim with Mike was established as a one-time event by teammates and friends for Mike Nyeholt, a three-time All-American swimmer paralyzed from the chest down after a motorcycle accident in 1981.
The first event was held on March 7, 1981, and volunteers aimed to purchase a specially equipped van for the superstar athlete.
To everyone’s surprise, the event raised $58,000, far exceeding the amount needed for the van. The excess money was used to create the Physically Challenged Athletes Scholarship Fund at USC, the first of its kind in the nation.
Nyeholt was so overwhelmed with support that he promised to swim the next year to raise more money for future athletes. He kept his promise, swimming the following year and changing the program’s name.
Nyeholt now co-chairs the committee that coordinates the annual event, which has raised $9.6 million in the last 29 years.
“While the event was initiated first only to help Mike, the goal is to now help others live by Mike’s example and prove that anyone can work with physical disabilities,” said Ron Orr, director of Swim with Mike.
The Swim with Mike event includes food, celebrities, raffle prizes, massage centers, kid’s corners, barbeques, silent auctions, Olympics participants and more.
Those who aren’t adept swimmers but want to be involved can become a corporate partner, advertise in the program, donate an item to the swimmer participant goody bags or give an item to the silent auction.
“We are USC’s largest philanthropy; we’ve been around for 30 years and are a huge community in that we have the marching band, the football team and the song girls involved,” said Scott Orr, graduate student at USC and co-chair of the student staff for Swim with Mike.
The Swim with Mike program is truly a “smaller family within the Trojan Family,” said Alison Adams, an undergraduate student at USC and co-chair of the student staff for Swim with Mike. Swim with Mike “is definitely something you’re part of for life,” she added.
Each scholarship recipient brings in another network of people that wants to get involved and make a difference. Swim with Mike is a way to “do action and create a ripple effect,” Ron Orr said.
Swim with Mike started at USC and according to Ron Orr will always be an integral part of the USC community. He said he hopes to “leave an endowment and legacy behind to help other athletes who fall victim to tragedy for many years to come.”

The USC women’s tennis team is coming off a successful Pac-10 weekend at home after beating both Arizona and Arizona State.
The No. 16 Women of Troy (13-7, 5-1) will wrap up the regular season today in Westwood, Calif., with a match against crosstown rival UCLA.
Pairings · Junior Lyndsay Kinstler will be paired with freshman Valeria Pulido in this weekend’s final dual meet of the season against crosstown rival UCLA in Westwood, Calif. - Geo Tu | Daily Trojan 
For USC to have any chance at the Pac-10 title this year, it has to beat No. 7 UCLA (18-3, 5-1). If USC wins, it will most likely play against Stanford during the Pac-10 tournament in Ojai, Calif., this weekend. At 6-0, No. 10 Stanford is the only undefeated team in the Pac-10 and can guarantee itself at least a share of this year’s Pac-10 title if it beats No. 12 California on Saturday.
USC will have to play Stanford if the teams are both in contention for the Pac-10 crown after this weekend’s dual meets. The teams played earlier this month, but rain postponed the doubles play with the singles tied 3-3. According to Intercollegiate Tennis Association rules, their match will have to be resumed at 0-0 only if the Stanford-USC match is a determinant for the 2010 Pac-10 title.
As for the weekly team rankings issued by the ITA, USC moved up one spot from No. 17 to No. 16. Individual rankings were also released Tuesday for the first time since March 30 where USC boasts four nationally ranked singles players.
In singles, junior Maria Sanchez continues to be the highest-ranked singles player for the team, checking in at No. 3 in the nation with a 17-2 singles record for this season. Sophomore Alison Ramos is settled just inside the nation’s top 25 at No. 24 and is followed by two Trojan freshmen, No. 28 Danielle Lao and No. 100 Valeria Pulido.
In doubles, Sanchez is also ranked on three different doubles teams with Lao at No. 55, Pulido at No. 70 and junior Lyndsay Kinstler at No. 80.
Just like the Trojans, the Bruins are also up one spot this week, from No. 8 to No. 7. In singles, Yasmin Schnack leads the Bruins at No. 8, followed by No. 26 Andrea Remynse and No. 51 Noelle Hickey. In doubles, Remynse and Schnack keep their No. 4 ranking, while Hickey and Nina Pantic enter the rankings at No. 77.
For today’s matchup, the Bruins will bring some tough competition for the Women of Troy. Although USC is 42-32 all-time against the Bruins, UCLA edged USC with a 4-3 win when the teams first clashed previously this season.
“We know it’s a big match, but we’re going to approach it wanting to win like any other match and not put any added stress on ourselves,” Sanchez said.
During the teams’ last meeting, UCLA easily grabbed the doubles point, but since then USC has juggled the doubles duos and changed up all the pairs at every position.
“The team has been playing really well lately so that gives us confidence,” Pulido said. “We know that this is not going to be an easy match, but we are prepared for it.”
Unlike the earlier meeting, today’s contest will play a huge role in determining the Pac-10 standings. Their match will start at 1:30 p.m. at the Los Angeles Tennis Center.

Looking to erase the bad memories of the three-game sweep it suffered last weekend against California at Dedeaux Field, the USC baseball team travels to Arizona State tonight to take on the Sun Devils in the first of another three-game set in Tempe, Ariz., this weekend.
USC (15-17, 2-7) will likely send senior Kevin Couture to the mound in tonight’s 6:30 p.m. matchup. The right-hander is 2-1 with a 6.99 ERA in nine starts this season. In his last outing against the Golden Bears, the senior lasted just two and one-third innings, giving up nine runs (seven earned) on nine hits. The Trojans lost the game, 16-9.
After dropping two of three last weekend to Washington State, No. 3 the Sun Devils (28-3, 6-3), undefeated at home and tied for first place in the Pac-10, will send out right-hander Seth Blair to start the series tonight. The junior is 5-0 with a 3.09 ERA in 13 starts this season. In his last start at Washington State, Blair pitched a solid six and one-third innings, giving up five runs (two earned) on seven hits with seven strikeouts. Arizona State lost the game, 6-5.
Saturday’s 6:30 p.m. matchup likely will pit USC sophomore Ben Mount (3-2, 3.57 ERA) against the Sun Devils’ Merrill Kelley (7-0, 3.77 ERA). Sunday’s 12:30 p.m. series finale will showcase USC sophomore Andrew Triggs (1-5, 4.19 ERA) and Arizona State sophomore Jake Borup (6-1, 3.35 ERA).
The Sun Devils have compiled a 3.03 staff ERA on the season, compared to the Trojans’ 4.65. Arizona State is hitting .346 as a team, while USC is batting .287.
The Trojans’ pitchers will need to be careful with Sun Devils’ sophomore infielder Zack MacPhee, a Pac-10 Player of the Year candidate. He is batting .445 on the season with six home runs, 43 RBI and 13 stolen bases.
But USC has some firepower of its own. Sophomore Ricky Oropesa leads the Pac-10 with 11 home runs to go along with his team-leading .328 batting average and 33 RBI. Sophomore Matt Foat also provides some power for the Trojans, heading into the weekend series with five home runs, 28 RBI and a .322 average.
USC heads into tonight’s matchup looking for its first Pac-10 series win of the season. The Trojans have lost their first three Pac-10 series against Stanford, Oregon State and California.
Arizona State leads the all-time series against USC by a slim margin, 94-93.

Even with a playoff spot assured, the USC men’s volleyball team isn’t taking the last two games of the regular season lightly.
Rather, the No. 6 Trojans know that wins at No. 14 UC San Diego and No. 10 Long Beach State this weekend would give them a huge boost as they head into the postseason. USC beat both teams 3-0 in January.
“We’re looking to primarily have good momentum heading into this new season,” USC coach Bill Ferguson said. “I told the guys, ‘How would finishing 5-1 at the end of the season feel instead of 2-4?’ — not to harp on a year that might have happened a year before this one.”
Ferguson is referencing last year, when the Trojans finished the season winning only two of their last six games but ended up playing in the national championship match. Despite that, the Trojans are focusing on the present.
USC (14-10, 11-9) is playing for the sixth or seventh seed in the eight-team MPSF tournament that starts next weekend. The Trojans can get the sixth seed with a win or a UCLA loss this weekend. But if the Bruins win out and USC loses both its games, it will finish in seventh.
Either way, that means the Trojans will have to go on the road to play the first round, and they are using these road games to prepare themselves for that.
“We just want to really clean things up and get to the point where we can build momentum for ourselves for the playoffs,” said Murphy Troy, junior and opposite hitter. “We know we’re going to have to go on the road [during the playoffs], and we want to start the playoffs on the right foot. That means ending the regular season on the right foot.”
The Trojans had a tougher time than expected last weekend, having to go five sets in a win against Pacific and then losing in three sets to No. 1 Stanford in a game that was closer than the score indicated, was the absence of injured starting junior libero Tri Bourne.
Bourne broke his left thumb a week and a half ago in practice and hasn’t played since. Ferguson listed him as day-to-day, and he has slowly been building up his practice time. In his place, Ferguson used junior outside hitter Sean Dennis and senior outside hitter Tyler Stevens, both of whom Ferguson praised as doing a solid job, but the team knows it is missing a key element in Bourne.
“Whenever you’re changing the lineup around at all, you got to expect some inconsistencies, and that’s what we experienced this past weekend,” Troy said.
Dennis started 17 games for the Trojans last year, and Stevens has three years of experience on the team, so Ferguson knows he has capable players ready to go if Bourne can’t play.
“We’re going to wait and see. Tri has been practicing. Tyler and Sean have been practicing and playing outside,” Ferguson said. “We’re prepared for what the situation may be but we just don’t know. We’re going to have to see how the bone heals and how much pain [Bourne] can tolerate.”

I’m sure you have seen the video by now.
After all, it has been watched almost two million times.
The football player in the clip runs a sweep, darts to the sideline, cuts back once, twice and then a third time while defenders fall around him as if their legs suddenly turned to jelly. Running in a dirty white uniform surrounded by fast-approaching dark jerseys, he speeds down the field frantically in search of open space, breaking free in an effortless change of direction. As he crosses the plane of the goal line, the scene behind him is reminiscent more of the conclusion of an epic battle than a single play in a football game.
When you think about it, these images could belong to any number of spectacular plays in USC’s seemingly never-ending football highlight reel.
But the video didn’t come from the Trojans’ film vault. It came from a scrimmage last week, featuring a player that has yet to experience a down in college football: freshman phenom running back Dillon Baxter.
The video is now viral — in addition to the flood of views it received on YouTube and its propagation on sports blogs, the minute-and-a-half clip managed to grace the homepage of      Yahoo.com.
If the comparisons of Baxter to former Trojan Reggie Bush didn’t already exist, they certainly do now; USC coach Lane Kiffin himself dared to make the comparison.
I know what you are thinking — we’ve all heard this before, both with Baxter and every other star tailback to play for the Trojans since Bush left.
Joe McKnight came to USC blanketed with the same expectations; he was supposed to round out a decade chock-full of star running backs and provide the finishing touch to the argument that the Trojans’ ground game was unmatched in college football.
But, despite a successful career by most standards, it didn’t turn out as planned — and in the true nature of Los Angeles sports fans, panic ensued.
So, to prevent any mid-November stress-induced stomach ulcers, I propose that we take a different approach to next season: Let’s end any and all comparisons of Baxter to Bush right now.
Granted, it’s hard to do, as the similarities between the two backs are striking. Both hail from San Diego — where they recorded monstrous numbers in high school (Baxter actually starred at quarterback as well) — they have similar body compositions, use a bruising yet lightning quick style of play and can excel in multiple positions on the field at any time.
It’s not that I don’t think he’ll live up to the hype; in fact, the freakish talent that Baxter has shown leads me to believe that he will go on to an illustrious, record-breaking career at USC. It’s the image that is being stamped on him that I’m worried about.
Forcing Baxter into the Reggie Bush mold will only stunt his growth as a competitor. Rarely do two players — even ones who have so much in common — develop identical styles of play as they progress in their career, and it is even rarer that both find overwhelming success.
As Baxter is given more freedom to become his own style of back, there is a greater chance that he will embrace the role and feel comfortable in his position.
And in case you forgot, the face of the team has changed significantly over the past five years.
There is no longer a LenDale White to provide the “thunder” to Baxter’s “lightning” as White so often did back in 2004 and 2005 with Bush, not to mention the fact that Matt Leinart isn’t taking snaps behind center anymore.
This new team is one of the most inexperienced Trojan squads of the last decade, and their success will rely on a game plan much different from teams of years past. While another Reggie Bush would certainly help, the Trojans need someone suited specifically for this team’s needs, and it is that opportunity in which Baxter will be able to create his own personal legacy.
Although the 30 or so seconds of ankle-breaking and awe-inspiring footage making its rounds on the Internet may conjure up images of No. 5 in your mind, try extra hard to resist.
Because, with the right training and guidance, there may just be a new number to remember a couple years down the road: 28.
“One-Two Punch” runs every other Friday. To comment on this article, visit dailytrojan.com or e-mail James at jbianchi@usc.edu.
I beg to differ.  There certainly is a “thunder” to Baxter’s “lightning”.  His name is Alan Bradford.  This could end up being the most high-powered one-two punch in the Pac 10 this year.

Sophomore quarterback Matt Barkley has taken the lead over senior Mitch Mustain in the race for the Trojans’ starting quarterback position, USC coach Lane Kiffin said after practice Thursday.
Moving up · Sophomore quarterback Matt Barkley has developed a strong connection with senior wide receiver Ronald Johnson during spring practice, which has helped Barkley move up in the quarterback race. - Geo Tu | Daily Trojan 
The announcement came after Barkley completed the vast majority of his passes in an intra-squad scrimmage during the practice that marked the halfway point of spring ball. Barkley also made several impressive throws under pressure.
“Matt’s been playing really, really well,” Kiffin said. “Mitch has had a few too many turnovers, bad decision making, but he’s doing good too.”
Kiffin quickly dispelled any notions that the job is Barkley’s on a permanent basis.
“We’ll continue as we go out there to split the reps,” Kiffin said. “Maybe as we go into next week [the quarterback race] will change. We’ll see how they play Saturday.”
Many of Barkley’s passes were in the direction of senior wide receiver Ronald Johnson, who was open on nearly every play the Trojans ran.
“It appears to be obvious that they have really grown together,” Kiffin said of Barkley and Johnson. “[Johnson] has become the go-to guy this spring because he makes plays. It’s exciting to see. At the rate they’re going, I think it’s going to be a special combination.”
Johnson agreed with his coach, saying that he and Barkley were able to develop chemistry both on and off the field.
“I tried to hang with [Barkley] as much as possible,” Johnson said. “If he goes out, I’m going to go out. I just try to understand what he does, pick his mind a little bit, and we just connected from there.”
Meanwhile, Mustain was solid, if not quite as sharp as Barkley. While it seemed like a majority of Barkley’s passes were on the money, Mustain occasionally threw into empty spaces and on one pass overthrew his receiver by five feet resulting in an interception.
However, Kiffin made it clear that Mustain was not the only player who needed improvement.
“Today was just okay,” Kiffin said. “It was a little bit sloppy. We need to pick the tempo up, the physical aspect of practice. Guys can’t get complacent, even the guys who are playing at a higher level.”
As for the rest of the offense, the Trojans continued to experiment with the Wildcat formation, sending Barkley out wide and putting freshman tailback (and new YouTube sensation) Dillon Baxter behind center. For Baxter, who ran the offense at Mission Bay High School in San Diego, the formation is a bit trickier at the college level.
“The defensive ends are way faster,” Baxter said with a laugh. “The linebackers read it real well. As an offense, we just have to keep running it and see where it takes us.”
With the second half of spring football beginning Saturday, Kiffin says he expects the team to start taking bigger steps.
“It’s time to go to the next level,” Kiffin said. “We need to make sure guys want to be the best in the country, not just the best on this field.”

Being a music major requires a lot of love for your chosen instrument and a hefty amount of dedication. USC’s Thornton School of Music accepts only those with true talent, and applicants to the school’s 11 Bachelor of Music programs must prove their sonic potential by submitting an audition tape.
Emily Intersimone, a senior majoring in jazz studies, is preparing for her senior recital for the Thornton School of Music. Sarah Bennett | Daily Trojan
With these high admission standards, it is only fitting that Thornton require its majors to leave the school in mostly the same manner in which they gained admittance — with a performance.
Along with contributions to concerts across campus — such as this week’s Jazz in the Park series — the school also requires students attempting to gain their Bachelor of Music to perform their own senior recital.
Recitals are a way for Thornton’s students to culminate their years of hard work in a night of musical enjoyment. The concerts are open to USC students, but with little or no advertisement of the recitals on campus, they remain mostly hidden gems.
For jazz studies major and pianist Emily Intersimone, the day of her recital — the first of the senior recital season — is fast approaching.
Intersimone’s interest in music originated with her family. Both of her parents play the guitar, and although neither is a professional musician, they managed to inspire her musical interest. Her mother and sister used to write songs together, and she began to learn how to sing from them. Intersimone also signed up for piano lessons, and it was her piano teacher who introduced her to jazz.
After graduating from Santa Catalina High School in Monterey, Calif., she was drawn to USC’s impressive jazz program.
“I really like that it was within a big university,” Intersimone said. “I was really drawn to some of the faculty members here. USC has a really great community in the jazz department.”
Though her focus of study is jazz piano, Intersimone is also a composer, singer and songwriter. Her website offers downloads and streams of original tracks such as “Sunflowers” and “Playground.”
Given Intersimone’s quirky personality and far-reaching musical background, her recital is sure to be a good show, especially considering she’s been planning it since winter break.
“I spent a large amount of time getting the set list ready,” she said. “I’m trying not to construct something that I’m going to have program notes about, but [instead] something in my head that creates a kind of narrative.”
Her concert will take place Saturday and — with the help of other singers and instrumentalists — will showcase nine pieces, including some original works along with pieces from artists who influenced her style, such as James Taylor and Joni Mitchell.
“[I like] any music you listen to and think, ‘Oh, that has a ton of soul,’” she said.
For Intersimone, the final recital serves as the perfect gateway into the world of music performance. Whatever the genre, musicians must become accustomed to being in the spotlight and putting on a self-promoted concert is great experience.
“I used to have horrible stage fright as a kid but now it just kind of varies depending on my mood,” she said. “I’ll probably not be able to sleep on Friday night worrying about the catering and everything, but for the music I’m really excited.”
Most big-name artists today — Lady Gaga is a prime example — started performing in small venues and can now brag of chart-topping hits and various Grammy nominations. And even in the absence of fame and fortune, music majors can find joy in the ability to share their passion and contribute to the growth of their genre.
As Intersimone demonstrates, many Thornton students go beyond the classroom curricula, creating their own websites and trying their best to expand their art and share it with anyone willing to listen.
“It’s taken me a while to get warmed up to the idea, but now I want to get out there and perform as much as possible,” she said.
The senior recitals will continue over the coming weeks, but because there is no compiled schedule, music lovers will have to scout the corkboards lining the halls of the music school buildings for specific information.
After accomplishing years of training and finishing it all off with a stellar one-off performance, Thornton students will be able to describe themselves as confidently as Intersimone does: “ready to go out into the world.”

“Memories are all you end up with,” Ricardo Morales says as he ponders the assault and murder of his wife 25 years earlier. “At least pick the nice ones.”
Remember me · The Secret In Their Eyes follows a former criminal investigator and won the 2010 Oscar for best foreign language film. - Photos courtesy of Sony Pictures Classics 
The Secret in Their Eyes, the 2010 Academy Award winner for best foreign language film, follows the efforts of former Buenos Aires criminal investigator Benjamín Espósito (Ricardo Darín) to make a novel out of a 25-year-old rape and murder case. In what he describes as “another lifetime,” the case unexpectedly turns his career upside-down and drives a wedge between him and the woman he loves before he is able to profess his feelings for her.
As he painfully relives the fallout from the brutal homicide, which — through a series of flashbacks that correspond to the successive rough drafts of the novel — constitutes the majority of the film, Benjamín realizes that only by drawing the hurt he has repressed for decades into the open can he bring closure to the unresolved case.
The at times graphic film, based on the novel La Pregunta De Sus Ojos by Eduardo Sacheri, does not gloss over the unsavory reality of the rapes, murders and corruption that take place in modern-day Argentina.
An early flashback begins with quirky and harmless bickering about Espósito not wanting to take on another case, as well as his endearing verbal paralysis in front of love interest Irene Hastings (Soledad Villamil), a woman both his professional and social superior.
After arriving on the crime scene, Benjamín stops mid-sentence as he is led into a bedroom to see the naked, battered body of 23-year-old beauty Liliana Coloto (Carla Quevedo) contorted at the foot of the bed where she was raped and beaten to death by a childhood friend. Unable to speak as he takes in the scope of horror and sadness, he approaches the case with utmost seriousness from that moment forward.
In a later scene, Benjamín arrests and draws a confession out of sociopath Isidoro Gómez (Javier Godino), only to find out later that Gómez was released by the Argentine government. Benjamín listens on in helpless disbelief as a fascist official dismisses Isidoro’s conviction, explaining that he’s a smart kid whose personal life shouldn’t bar him from assisting the Buenos Aires secret police force.
Under the threat of a freed, deranged murderer with a personal score to settle, Benjamín is forced to flee Buenos Aires and start his life over elsewhere, leaving behind Irene who, protected from the corrupt government by her family name, is able to stay.
The cast of the film does not disappoint.
The two leads, Ricardo Darín and Soledad Villamil, give touching, nuanced performances as driven and passionate individuals burdened with immense regret.
Darín in particular succeeds in portraying his character as instinctively dedicated to justice, chivalry and truth, struggling in a world that is decidedly not. As Ricardo Morales, Pablo Rago garners audience sympathy as a tortured soul unable to recover from what life has taken from him, his kindhearted nature warped into something as pitiable as it is disturbing.
And beloved Argentine comedian Guillermo Francella adds hilarity to the grim-ness of the story as the oft-inebriated Sandoval — Benjamín’s closest friend and partner in anti-crime.
Director Juan José Campanella does an outstanding job conveying the sheer depth and dimension of human emotion in the story, so much so that we can forgive his occasional meandering into the less-than-novel realm of good cop/bad cop dialogue.
The film is as much about the rediscovery of the past as it is about love and depravity. The characters are each in their own way tied down by their history, all unable to move forward under the weight of memories of lost loves and, in the cases of Benjamín and Irene, long, festering “what ifs.” Some are fortunate to enjoy the benefit of second chances; others are not so lucky.
The Secret in Their Eyes combines all the suspense of a legal thriller with the self-reflexive insight of a memoir. The audience sees and the characters learn that what we lose sight of — whether it’s an opportunity for love or the whereabouts of a murderer — is never as deeply buried in the past as we might believe.
“It wasn’t another lifetime,” an eager Benjamín professes to Irene. “It was this one. It is this one.”

When it came down to either James Cameron or Kathryn Bigelow for best director at last month’s Academy Awards ceremony, what is usually a formal battle between multiple talented directors became something quite personal. Not only are the two directors former husband and wife, but they have also collaborated on more than one film within the past 20 years, most notably 1995’s Strange Days — probably one of the best films of the 1990s.
Set on New Year’s Eve 1999, the approaching millennium finds the city of Los Angeles in utter turmoil as the city has devolved into a brutal police state. As more and more people resort to violence, drug-like Superconducting Quantum Interference Device (“SQUID”) recordings — imprints of sensory experiences taken directly from the cerebral cortex that allow for a completely immersive experience at a later date — are in urgent demand, and former-cop-turned-street-hustler Lenny Nero (Ralph Fiennes) is the city’s top supplier.
What makes SQUID recordings so valuable and illegal is their ability to record life in complete and perfect details and, thus, provide the user with the ultimate sensation of actually experiencing situations such as an armed robbery or sex with an incredibly beautiful woman.
Lenny describes this sensation to a customer by proclaiming, “This is not ‘like-T.V.-only-better.’ This is life. It’s a piece of somebody’s life. It’s pure and uncut, straight from the cerebral cortex. I mean, you’re there, you’re doing it, you’re seeing it, you’re hearing it, you’re feeling it.”
The film’s plot reveals an array of corrupt and deviant characters that Lenny finds himself either doing business with or fearing for his life from as the dawn of the new millennium draws near and the city of Los Angeles decays.
Strange Days, which passed almost unnoticed after its initial release, benefits from an enormously talented supporting cast including Angela Bassett, Juliet Lewis, Vincent D’Onofrio and Tom Sizemore, but most importantly it was edited, co-written and co-produced by James Cameron along with director Kathryn Bigelow.
Though they were already divorced by the time they began the collaboration, both filmmakers were able to combine their talents to produce a film that is just as feverishly intense as The Hurt Locker and every bit as visually stunning as Avatar — with proper adjustments to account for inflation of audience expectations since the 1990s, of course.
What makes Strange Days such an incredible motion picture is its harmonious combination of the distinct styles that both directors have now become so well known for.
Cameron’s invention of the original story and his work with Jay Cocks on the actual script is the best screenwriting Cameron has ever done. The plot’s conspiracy unfolds into something deeply haunting, and it presents a ruthless narrative and even more ruthless characters who slowly corrupt the already sleazy existence of the film’s hero.
And like Avatar, Strange Days showcases some very elaborate special effects that were also developed by Cameron’s production company Lightstorm, the most impressive being a camera system that was used to capture the film’s many point-of-view sequences to depict the action of “wire-tripping,” letting the audience experience the SQUID recordings. The technology took Cameron and his team over a year to develop.
The opening sequence showcases this state-of-the-art camera technique as the process of wire-tripping is portrayed in a three-minute shot that puts the audience right into the action of an armed robbery. Although Cameron created the technology used to capture the action, Bigelow deserves sole credit for the pure adrenaline present in this particular scene.
As she did with her award-winning film The Hurt Locker, Bigelow produces pure intensity through direction, camera work, editing and sound design to accurately express what a rush wire-tripping must be for the characters who experience it. Like the characters using SQUID recordings, those watching the film are also drawn in the action and — by virtue of Bigelow’s immersive direction — truly able to feel as though they are in the moment, experiencing it completely, rather than just watching it.
There are few directors that can capture this kind of total immersion sensation better than Bigelow.
Having her direct a script that was written by Cameron and produced and developed by his one-of-a-kind production team makes for a film that is at once visually stunning and intellectually stimulating.
That was in 1995. It’s hard not to wonder what would happen if the two directors teamed up again now, after all they have both accomplished. With Cameron producing, writing and designing all of the special effects while Bigelow directs, the result would almost certainly be a film that is at once greater than both Avatar and The Hurt Locker.
Strange Days is proof of exactly what can happen when two dedicated and talented directors combine their efforts and effortlessly change the momentum and capability of motion pictures. The film is so good, it is a shame it has not received more attention.
It certainly deserves it — after all, in it is all the masterful technique that would eventually resurface into two of the best films of 2009.

For the first time since 1994, the USC men’s tennis team has an opportunity to win the Pac-10 championship outright as UCLA looks to play the spoiler.
History · Junior Jaak Poldma and the Trojans have the chance to claim an outright Pac-10 title for the first time in nearly two decades. - Gary Fung | Daily Trojan 
To go along with the season finale, USC will honor former coach Dick Leach — a four-time national championship winner — during the match scheduled to start at 3 p.m. at Marks Stadium.
The past three seasons have seen the No. 12 Bruins (13-6, 3-2) beat the No. 4 Trojans (19-2, 5-0) in the season’s final match to claim the Pac-10 title, but this year the momentum favors the Trojans.
USC has won its previous two matches against its rivals, including a 4-0 win at the ITA National Indoor Championships and a 6-1 victory at UCLA.
The reasons for the success so far this season against the UCLA rivals were not readily apparent, but doubles play and the team’s depth have been important factors.
“The big thing is that doubles have been solid this year,” sophomore Steve Johnson said. “J.T. [Sundling] and [Daniel] Nguyen really stepped up at No. 1 during the ITAs, which provided a big confidence boost.”
USC coach Peter Smith mentioned that the law of averages might be in effect after a period of success in past seasons for the Bruins.
“UCLA has had a good bit of fortune come their way the last few years,” Smith said. “The pendulum has started to swing in our favor recently.”
Even though the Trojans cannot pinpoint a specific reason for their recent streak of successes against the Bruins, they can definitely agree that no matter what the setting or the situation, the UCLA match seems to carry extra weight.
“Anytime we play UCLA it’s huge,” junior Jaak Poldma said. “It doesn’t matter when we play, we have to be ready to play them.”
The familiarity with the opponent has both pluses and minuses, but in general the experience many players have against one another is a benefit.
“It works both ways,” Johnson said of playing junior Holden Seguso twice this season already. “I feel it’s a good advantage for us. We know [UCLA’s] strengths and weaknesses; we understand what to avoid and what to attack.”
In the most recent ITA rankings, both teams are well represented, as the Trojans have five ranked singles players — including two top-10 players in No. 2 Johnson and No. 7 senior Robert Farah — and four doubles teams.
The Bruins have four players ranked in the top 100 for singles, along with two ranked doubles squads.
UCLA looks to head into this match with some extra incentive after falling to Arizona 4-3 in its previous match.
This was the first loss in UCLA history to the Wildcats, but the Trojans will not take the Bruins lightly no matter what recent history indicates.
“We know UCLA is capable,” Smith said. “ We are not going to be overconfident. We are not going to overlook any match.”

The tired phrase, “it’s just another game,” is spoken far too often by athletes who are trained to look at each upcoming game objectively.
Final chance · Senior utility Forel Davies is among four senior Women of Troy players who will get one last regular season-shot at UCLA. - Gary Fung | Daily Trojan 
However, in Saturday’s home matchup against the No. 4 UCLA Bruins — a team the Women of Troy drubbed 13-3 Feb. 7 — the cliché simply does not apply.
At 4:30 p.m., star seniors goalie Tumua Anae, two-meter Kami Craig, utility Forel Davies and drivers Alexandra Kiss and Kally Lucas will square off against UCLA in McDonald’s Swim Stadium for the last time.
This rematch of last year’s NCAA championship game won by the Bruins offers the women’s water polo team an opportunity to post its first consecutive wins over UCLA since 2006. Fresh in the seniors’ minds are the struggles they have experienced against a historically strong UCLA team over the past four years.
“Having lost to them in the finals twice and in the semifinals [during my career], we’re definitely fired up,” Lucas said.
The Women of Troy know they will face a determined UCLA team looking for revenge after being embarrassed at this year’s Stanford Invitational. Although UCLA graduated many prominent players from its 2009 championship squad, its women’s water polo team remains a powerhouse, noted for its swimming speed.
However, as is the case in all their games, Lucas and the Women of Troy are much more concerned about their play than the other team’s. If they execute and play up to their potential, it does not matter who is in the pool.
“Putting shots in the cage is what it comes down to,” Lucas said. “Against them in the finals last year, we missed too many shots and went something like 4-for-38.”
Indeed, capitalizing on scoring chances and finishing shots has been a focus for Jovan Vavic and his team throughout the season.
When asked if she had any hopes for her final home game, Lucas smiled and paused for a moment.
“We want to dominate,” Lucas said. “It’s exciting to play them. I can’t wait to play in front of my friends and family one last time.”
In a season in which these five seniors have contributed an incalculable amount to the team’s success, it seems only fitting and inevitable that the Women of Troy will accomplish the one feat these seniors have yet to realize: beating the Bruins twice in a row.

The last time I visited San Francisco, I remember driving under the cables of the Golden Gate Bridge, taking in the view at the bottom of “the crookedest street in the world” and getting salty whiffs at Fisherman’s Wharf — all requisite hotspots every tourist must visit in order to say they’ve been to the city.
Yet some would argue that tourists’ impressions of San Francisco are robbed of a vital cultural element. The quaintly named Uptown Tenderloin — the squalid, poor, drug-ridden quarter of the city — has earned a soft spot with some San Franciscans for its unique culture, so much so that community and civic leaders are now pushing to revitalize the Tenderloin to make it another tourist stop.
But what would attract tourists to the area? It’s a red light district rife with high crime. Needless to say, the common perception of the Tenderloin is not a pleasant one, with many San Franciscans avoiding the area unless necessary.
Its grittiness certainly gives the Tenderloin character — it was recently deemed a historic district on the National Register of Historic Places. Eradicating it would erase a rich facet of the city’s history: Like an endangered culture, many of the Tenderloin’s famous billiard halls, theaters and speakeasies that were once full of life are now gone.
In some ways, the Tenderloin shares its historic-but-high-crime character with USC’s University Park. Long before we stepped foot on the campus, Downtown Los Angeles was a district that boasted diverse architecture with a rich agricultural and cultural history. Today, there are remnants of this history, and University Park faces a similar fate as the Tenderloin. USC’s Master Plan will transform much of what we know as University Park by 2030, though hopefully for the better. The plan seeks to form strategic partnerships with the community in order to improve the quality of life in terms of safety and aesthetics.
The difference between University Park and the Tenderloin, however, is that a plan to transform the Tenderloin into a tourist attraction entails a kind of revitalization that attracts tourists ­— but apparently without benefit to its 30,000 residents.
There are plans to create a museum and walking tours of “the world’s largest collection of historic single-room occupancy hotels,” which would be a “real plus” to tourists, who usually aren’t exposed to such subcultures, according to Randy Shaw, a proponent of the revitilization. San Francisco Mayor Gavin Newsom supports the proposal, issuing a grant to rebrand the Tenderloin with a positive identity in hopes of drawing tourist dollars to the area.
But turning it into another stop for tourists in San Francisco, which reaped $8 billion in tourist revenue last year, seems like a step in the wrong direction. Revitalizing the district in order to mitigate the crippling poverty problems or clean up the illicit drug scene is one thing; revitalizing it for the sake of tourism is entirely different.
In the end, the Tenderloin may lose what has allowed it to thrive as a rich community of historic significance.
In our case, the Master Plan seems to echo USC’s mission, to encourage “the development of human beings and society as a whole through the cultivation and enrichment of the human mind and spirit.” Obviously, it takes the students as its first priority. However, to do so with a disregard for its societal impact, much like what Shaw’s Tenderloin idea proposes, would be irresponsible.
Hopefully, our Master Plan respects the surrounding community enough to maintain beneficial partnerships with it and not lose sight of its well-being.

Though legislation on marijuana has been the hot topic on campus in recent weeks, Trojans should be aware of another measure that will be voted on much sooner.
On June 8, Californians will vote on Proposition 14, known as the Top-Two Primaries Act, which, if passed, will change California’s present closed primary system to an open primary system that will allow all registered citizens the opportunity to vote, regardless of party affiliation.
Julia Vann | Daily Trojan
The proposal would create “a single ballot for primary elections for … congressional and state elective offices,” with the top two candidates from either party progressing to the general election.
The proposition, proposed by Sen. Abel Maldonado, seeks to rectify the wrongs of bipartisanship and its resultant policy gridlock and lack of forward momentum.
If anything, the proposal will redefine the political landscape of the state that is in need of some sort of change.
The proposition attempts to facilitate the election of more collaborative candidates.  By putting all candidates on the same ballot, they must all compete for the same constituents and so shift their own views toward the middle.
The statement in support of Proposition 14 in the Official Voter Information Guide claims, “Proposition 14 will help elect more practical office-holders who are more open to compromise … Non-partisan measures like Proposition 14 will push our elected officials to begin working together for the common good.”
The major and minor political parties are in adamant opposition to Proposition 14 because it will drastically alter their existing primary selection process and the way that each influences the election process in California.
Those in favor of the measure argue that the change will benefit independent party candidates: “Proposition 14 will give independent voters an equal voice in primary elections.” Those in opposition rebut: “Smaller political parties … will be forced off the ballot, further reducing choice.”
The minor party candidates will rarely — if ever — make it to a November runoff, and as such they will lose what little prominence or influence they now possess.
Major parties will face a different but equally significant challenge if the proposition passes. Whereas each of the major parties typically unite to support a single candidate prior to the November election, each now runs the risk of having two of their same candidates on the November ballot, or none at all.
Others have voiced different objections. As Rob Richie of The Huffington Post notes, “Prop. 14 does not even allow write-in candidates in the November runoff.”
Although true, there’s a valid reason: Let’s imagine that in one race, the Democrats have the top two vote-getters, so the Democratic party is split between the candidates in the November election. If the Republicans can organize well enough to get their write-in candidate on enough ballots, their candidate can win with only 34 percent of the vote. We now have either an official in government who was not selected by a majority or a subsequent runoff election to obtain a 50.1 percent or greater vote. Neither outcome is desirable.
Any time there is a proposed constitutional revision, the opponents tend to paint a picture of doom. But there is no significant risk to California.
Proposition 14 is modeled after a similar initiative in Washington state that has passed a constitutional challenge in the U.S. Supreme Court. Louisiana also has a similar primary system in place and neither Louisiana nor Washington has experienced any drastic political devastation as a result of such primary methods.
Bipartisanship and gridlock plague the government and hinder decisive action, but the ultimate question is: Will this proposal reduce either of these problems? The Public Policy Institute of California, a non-partisan organization, has published a comprehensive analysis of Proposition 14, which examines the hypothesized effects of the open primaries in California: “In short, [Proposition 14] would probably have a noticeable but modest effect on voting and representation in California. Crossover voting rates [voters that vote for a candidate of a party other than their own] could be high, but perhaps in only a handful of races. Moderates might benefit, but only slightly more often than under the current system.”
Should California pass such a measure? We can all agree that California is in drastic need of change. Change that encourages collaborative and effective government is absolutely necessary now.
Reid Roman is a freshman majoring in industrial and systems engineering.
The point of primary elections is to let each party choose their best candidate, and then run them against each other. So we can argue amongst ourselves without splitting the vote, then unite behind the winner. Without closed primaries, you often end up with the most popular party *losing* due to a split vote on their side.
The idea of “open primaries” corrupts that system. Is it really fair to the Democrats that Republicans can vote in their primary, forcing them to run a candidate that doesn’t represent them? Is it fair to Republicans that Democrats can meddle in their primary? Usually open primaries are only proposed in a state where one party has a distinct majority, because they WANT to corrupt the process. It would be much easier for the Democrats to dominate California politics if they could stuff the primary ballots and force the Republicans to run terrible candidates. That’s exactly what they’ll do, if we let them get away with it.
Reid, good article and thanks for bringing this prop to my notice. At the conclusion you noted “Change that encourages collaborative and effective government is absolutely necessary now”. However I agree with Richard’s comments, if this prop passes it will not encourage collaboration between parties but may actually preclude one party from participating at all. Additionally the minority parties will be left out altogether. In California this will give the Democrats carte blanche to pass anything they want. That, as we have seen with their policies and where it has led us, would be devastating to the state.
In the 2008 presidential primaries, Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton each polled slightly over 17,000,000 votes nationwide.  John McCain only polled 9,800,000 votes nationwide.  So if the United States were using a “Top-two” system to choose the president, the only two candidates on the November ballot would have been Obama and Clinton, with no write-ins allowed.  This would have shut out almost half the nation (the more conservative and Republican half) from any voice in the November election.  Such an election would enjoy no legitimacy at all.  No free country in the world would hold a presidential election and confine the choices to two members of the same party.  The general election campaign season is when all points of view should be heard and all voters should have the freedom to have someone to vote for in the general election who matches their policy preferences.

On the first official day recruits could announce what campuses they intended to bring their hoops game to next season, it seemed at first glance that the rich kept getting richer.
ESPNU’s top 50 players were going to traditional powerhouses like Kentucky, Kansas, UNC and Duke, while USC seem destined to be left out in the cold.
But according to a number of sources, thanks to the help of USC assistant coach Dieter Horton, Kevin O’Neill was able to snag a potential big-time post player, albeit for 2011, in Antelope Valley College’s Dewayne Dedmon.
While it easy to understand why prestigious programs accustomed to filling their recruiting boards with McDonalds All-Americans and Gatorade Player of the Year award winners passed on Dedmon, given that he only averaged 6.6 points and 7.8 rebounds for the Marauders last season, USC has not been shy in gushing about their newest acquisition.
“We are really excited that Dewayne decided to be a Trojan,” O’Neill said in a statement. “ I think he has great potential, is an excellent student and is an even better person. He will be a huge part of our successes in the future.”
That future will begin next January for the junior college recruit, when he will redshirt his freshman season, as he learns behind proven veterans Alex Stepheson and Nikola Vucevic during the 2010-2011 season.
What may be most remarkable about the Trojans’ future post presence is that he didn’t start playing basketball until his senior year at Lancaster High School, due to his beliefs as a Jehovah’s Witness. So while his numbers at Antelope Valley, where he was coached by Horton, are not gaudy and don’t jump off the page right away, USC still made quite a splash in grabbing Dedmon off the recruiting market.

If you happen to find yourself practicing your emergency earthquake plans in anticipation of the “Big One” in Southern California, you are not alone.
The year 2010 has experienced a significant increase in the number or earthquakes, with 70 more significant earthquakes in the last four months. The intensity of the earthquakes has increased with the frequency, with many of the quakes measuring above 4.0-point on the Richter scale.
With all this talk of earthquakes buzzing, the questionable “Big One” is on the tip of many tongues.
Egill Hauksson, a geophysicist at Caltech, said to the LA Times that Southern California residents should expect bigger earthquakes and more earthquakes in the next few years.
“What it means is that we are going to have more earthquakes than in the average year,” Hauksson said. “With more earthquakes, we’re bound to have more bigger ones. But there are always fewer of those than the smaller ones.”
Earthquake experts insist that larger quakes occur in cycles. Until now the Southern California region was a reasonably quiet area but might be about to enter a much more active state.
Earthquakes have been at the forefront of the media lately. The first major earthquake of 2010 hit in Port-au-Prince, Haiti and killed hundreds of thousands of people; two months later, Chile experienced an 8.8-magnitude earthquake.
In early April, an earthquake with an epicenter in Mexicali, Mexico shook several homes in Baja California and created temblors from Southern California to Arizona.
Experts said scientists can never be sure what causes an earthquake or what creates a cycle, as the movements of the tectonic plates in the earth are random.
One possibility, said Kate Hutton to the LA Times, a seismologist at Caltech, is that one fault line might change and stress out another plate, creating an earthquake in what scientists call the “cascade effect.”
“If that fault is ready to produce an earthquake anyway, it might do something. But it would have to be pretty close” for that to happen, she said.
