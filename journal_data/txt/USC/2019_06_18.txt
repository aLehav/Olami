Trojan fans will soon be able to enjoy the new and improved Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum as its renovation draws to a close.
Exposition Park’s most treasured commodity has undergone many changes over its 96-year history. Today, it resembles a shell of its old self as it proceeds past the latest big change. This most recent upgrade carries a budget of $315 million, some of which USC has received from its 10-year field naming deal with United Airlines.
USC and United agreed that in addition to the airline’s partial funding of the renovation, the Coliseum’s field would be renamed the United Airlines Field at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum. The early June compromise came after many local veteran groups opposed the original plan of naming the entire stadium the United Airlines Memorial Coliseum. 
The renovation process started back in 2013 when USC took over the Coliseum’s master lease. The lease stipulated a major renovation project for the historic home of Trojan football. On Oct. 29, 2015, USC unveiled a project with a privately funded budget of $270 million for massive restoration of the Coliseum that included dramatic upgrades to the stadium. 
The renovation will decrease the Coliseum’s seating capacity by about 16,000, which will allow for wider seats and increased leg room for spectators. The project will also add cup holders, Wi-Fi, two high-definition video boards, improved stadium and field lighting, and will restore the Coliseum’s peristyle to resemble the original design. 
Ken Mulvey, a Marines veteran and local business owner who now works on construction for the renovation, expressed his appreciation of the project. 
“This is a job I’m proud to be part of,” Mulvey said. “The Coliseum is better than ever. It stands as a memorial to World War I veterans, a community landmark and a great place to watch the Trojans play.”
The Coliseum will also introduce Scholarship Tower — a seven-story structure on the south side of the stadium that will include suites, loge boxes, club seats, a new concourse and a new press box. 
In recent months, because of weather conditions and the substantial work still to be done, concerns arose surrounding whether the stadium’s renovations would be completed by the designated date. However, the stadium is still scheduled to reopen in time for the Los Angeles Rams’ first preseason game on Aug. 24.
In response, the project budget ballooned from its original price tag of $270 million to $315 million to ensure that construction finishes in time. In the last month, the exterior of Scholarship Tower started to take shape, and the majority of the seats have been replaced with new and improved Cardinal Red seating, leaving the old ones to be auctioned as souvenirs for Coliseum faithfuls and offered to USC season ticket holders. 
More than 2,600 employees have been working on the renovation since January 2018 to keep the project moving toward its targeted finish date. The project has employed many local residents and veterans as part of USC and United’s commitment to give back to the Los Angeles community. 
The renovation to the legendary stadium has given hope to many L.A. natives in the job hunt. Because of the project, hundreds of jobs were provided for workers looking for sufficient living wages. 
“We diligently reached out to engage the whole community to participate and to gain the benefits of meaningful careers that pay living wages with benefits,” said Theodora Oyie, senior manager of community engagement for the project’s managing general contractor. 
The Coliseum isn’t just a venue for athletic competition. It’s a tribute to thousands of World War I veterans, and now it’s providing job opportunities for southern Californians eager to work. 
Thanks to the newest Coliseum renovations, the symbolic venue should stand tall on South Figueroa for decades into the future.

Jason Gill will take over as head coach of USC Baseball, Athletic Director Lynn Swann announced Friday. Gill will replace former coach Dan Hubbs, who was terminated after the Trojans missed the postseason for the fourth consecutive year.
“We are very excited to welcome Jason Gill to the Trojan family as the head coach of USC Baseball,” Swann said in a statement.
Gill brings plenty of head coaching experience to his new position at USC, having served as head coach of Loyola Marymount for the past 11 years. During that time, Gill’s LMU teams had an overall record of 322-286-1 for a .530 winning percentage.
This season, Gill guided the Lions to a 34-25 record, earning a spot in the postseason before being eliminated by the top overall seed in the nation, UCLA.
Gill began his collegiate baseball career as an infielder for Cal State Fullerton, reaching the College World Series in 1994. He served as an undergraduate assistant at CSUF the following year when the Titans won the national championship. After brief assistant coaching stints at Nevada, LMU and UC Irvine, Gill returned to CSUF in the same role and reached the College World Series in 2006 and 2007.
Gill will now try to bring USC to the College World Series as well — a feat the Trojans have not accomplished since 2001.
“Our desire was to get someone who can elevate USC baseball back into the postseason and help the team once again compete for a College World Series title,” Swann said.
Gill is known for his recruiting and player development skills. Gill coached 31 players at LMU that were selected in the MLB Draft and has seen 24 of his players reach the big leagues over the entirety of his coaching career.
Gill also has seven years of experience as a recruiting coordinator while serving as an assistant coach, bringing in six recruiting classes in the top 30 and two in the top 10 during that span. His recruiting classes at LMU ranked in the top 25 twice — which the program had failed to do for the previous 15 years.
“College baseball has some unique challenges with the roster size and the number of scholarships, and with recruits being drafted out of high school,” Swann said. “We wanted someone familiar with those challenges. We also wanted someone with a history of putting together a staff that can consistently prepare players to not only succeed in the college game but at the next level as well. All of those things led us to Coach Gill and to inviting him to lead our program forward.”
USC has not made the postseason since 2015, despite seeing 32 players selected in the MLB Draft in that span and welcoming top 25 recruiting classes the last two years.
This is uncharacteristic of a Trojan program that has won 12 national championships, six more than any other Division I school. USC has also sent a record 114 players to the Major Leagues.
Despite this, the Trojans have not made the College World Series since 2001 and have not brought a national championship trophy to Heritage Hall since 1998.
Gill, who has made the postseason nine times as a coach, hopes to be part of the solution.
“I would like to thank Lynn Swann and the USC administration for their belief in me as the next head baseball coach at USC,” Gill said in a statement. “I am looking forward to building on the traditions established by the great players and coaches from the most storied college baseball program in the country. USC’s commitment to winning championships while providing a top tier education is unmatched. I am extremely excited and can’t wait to get started.”

Michael Felix was elected to the USC Board of Trustees following over 34 years working in financial services, the University announced. 
“Michael Felix is an exceptional member of the Trojan Family with a remarkable history of service to the University,” Interim President Wanda Austin told USC News. “His dedication to his alma mater — coupled with his extraordinary financial expertise — make him a terrific addition to our board. His passion and experience will certainly prove invaluable.”
Felix serves as the global head of investment operations for Capital Group Companies in addition to holding leadership positions at several other Capital Group subsidiary companies, according to the USC School of Dramatic Arts.  
Accompanying his career success, Felix supported his alma mater throughout various volunteer roles, having held positions such as School of Dramatic Arts Board of Councilors chair, Caruso Catholic Center Advisory Board and Latino Alumni Association Corporate Advisory Councilmember, USC News stated. He has also taken part in several alumni groups, including his recent position as the 95th president of the Alumni Association’s Board of Governors.
“He is very kind, very humble, very committed to USC above anything else,” said LAA executive director Mercy Willard. “The only other thing that he’s more committed to obviously is his family. But, he loves USC, and he loves giving back.”
Founded in 1973, the LAA is one of the nation’s leading Latino alumni organizations. The association aims for the academic advancement of Latino students attending the University.
Throughout his time at the association, he co-chaired its endowment campaign, raising almost $4 million for LAA’s scholarship program, Willard said.
“Michael is going to be a great addition to the Board of Trustees, not only as a as a representative of the Latino community but just overall as an exemplary alumni,” Willard said. “He brings good perspective[s] on USC with the diversity lens that he represents but also as a savvy businessman and family man.” 
Felix grew up in Pico Rivera and did not expect to pursue higher education. However, after a particular high school teacher urged him to apply to a few universities, Felix got into USC. He began his college career in 1979, earning his bachelor’s degree in business administration from the Marshall School of Business. 
After graduating from USC, he worked with Deloitte Haskins and Sells, a company that provides audit, tax, legal, financial and consulting services, in Los Angeles prior to finding success at aforementioned Capital Group Companies in 1987. In three decades, he rose to his current position as the global head of investment operations, USC News reported.  
Now as a trustee, Felix plans to continue his efforts in creating a more inclusive and diverse atmosphere, USC News reported. He hopes to ensure that students from underrepresented and diverse populations will take advantage of opportunities at USC.
“[Felix is] definitely somebody that’s a good ambassador for USC, and someone you can count on,” Willard said. “I think that’s evident from the amount of time and resources that he devotes to his alma mater. He is definitely a die-hard Trojan and just a great human being.”

While USC’s commencement was more than a month ago, college graduation season is in full swing across the country. And with all the ceremonies comes a new element of the “free speech crisis” debate: censoring commencement speakers. Several colleges have struggled with faculty and students protesting their colleges’ speaker selections.
The organization Foundation for Individual Rights in Education (FIRE) reports that there have been at least 145 instances of schools pulling the plug on commencement speakers since 1987, with almost 100 of those coming within the last five years.
Butler University in 2010 refused to host Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts because he is “too controversial.” Conservative commentator Ann Coulter was asked not to speak at Fordham University in 2012. Politicians Tom Tancredo, Dick Cheney and Mitt Romney have all faced student complaints. Even Hillary Clinton was uninvited from the College of St. Catherine in 2008.
Even USC hasn’t been able to dodge the action. The Daily  Trojan reported that some students were unhappy with the selection of undergraduate commencement speaker Congresswoman Karen Bass because they didn’t want a political speaker. USC Gould graduates and faculty members  managed to topple the scheduled talk by Jeh Johnson, secretary of homeland security under President Obama. Protesting a speech is fine, but censoring is not. 
This year, New York University invited Steven Thrasher, an alumnus of their doctorate program, to deliver a commencement speech. In what was reported as a deviation from the script, Thrasher promoted and advocated his position to boycott, divest, and sanction what he called the “apartheid State of Israel.” 
If this were any other campus speaker, even at USC, it wouldn’t have elicited much of a reaction. Obviously, most would not endorse the speaker’s message, nor would they be proud to say they hosted him and provided a platform for him. But fighting to censor his speech isn’t a good idea. Those who do not know their opponent’s arguments do not completely understand their own. Debate is a vital component of a stimulating educational experience. 
That said, a commencement speech doesn’t allow time for debate. It is, in essence, a message that the hosting university believes would be inspirational to students. The difference between censoring an on-campus speaker and a commencement speaker is non-existent.
This isn’t to say that universities should actively search for provocative speakers and ask them to speak about controversial topics. Ultimately, a commencement speech is about, well, commencement —beginning a new phase of life. And that should be the main subject of any speech. Not a heavily politicized debate.
There is a certain level of tact and awareness required of graduation speakers. Obviously, controversial speech should not be off-limits in a commencement speech, but a strong one probably calls more for inspiration, not provocation. 
There will always be someone who disagrees with the politics of any speaker and maybe even part of the content of the speech itself. But it’s possible to still listen — and maybe even gain something — from paying attention. Malcolm X pointed this out in the beginning of his “The Ballot or The Bullet” speech: “Mr. Moderator, Brother Lomax, brothers and sisters, friends and enemies. I just can’t believe everyone in here is a friend, and I don’t want to leave anybody out.” 
If one finds themselves as one of these “enemies,” they have actions to take: condemn the speech, point out its fallacies and reveal its idiocy. But banning it based solely on offensiveness or disagreement is wrong; it’s too subjective. If we choose to ban one speaker, we must ban all speakers. And if we refuse to ban one, we must refuse to ban any.

Los Angeles is a city concealed under botox and filler, coated in a thick layer of Hollywood gloss and overshadowed by its glamorous reputation. 
Growing up less than two hours away, I carried a perception of Los Angeles that mirrored that of any other tourist — the city belonged to movie stars and internet celebrities, to hilltop mansions and beachside cottages, to movie lots and talent agencies. 
Despite the diverse neighborhoods that compose Los Angeles, and despite my proximity to the reality of the city, I held a stereotype.
It’s an easy stereotype to believe — informed by countless movies, TV shows, tabloids and celebrities, Los Angeles has fostered a reputation for its vanity. And, bolstered by smoothie bowls and juice bars abound, L.A.’s food scene has been a victim of this stereotype too — mocked, patronized and scorned by outsiders all over the world. 
After 2009, Michelin ceased publishing a Los Angeles guide, followed by a biting criticism from its former director: “The people in Los Angeles are not real foodies. They are not too interested in eating well but just in who goes to which restaurant and where they sit.” 
It seemed as though Michelin, too, waded in this stereotype.
Without Michelin, Los Angeles is relegated to talented critics like the late Jonathan Gold, whose yearly lists have shaped (and continue to shape) restaurant culture in the city. People were driving from Van Nuys to San Gabriel Valley, Koreatown, East Los Angeles and South Orange County to try Gold’s favorite dishes. 
Slowly, after the umpteenth condescending article from global publications praising “L.A.’s up-and-coming food scene,” the city garnered Michelin’s attention again. 
When I first heard about Michelin’s long-awaited return to the city, I felt a strange sense of validation, like Michelin was an estranged parent and my Los Angeles had finally impressed them again. 
For years, Michelin stars were an elusive sign of success to me, one that I hadn’t encountered in Southern California. In my eyes, Michelin transcended gourmet—It was a sign of culinary success I was desperate to try but was deprived of. 
This year, no Korean, Thai or Filipino restaurants were awarded a Michelin star. 
A single Mexican restaurant, the astounding Taco Maria, received one star. 
One Chinese restaurant in San Gabriel Valley received a star.  
Eleven Japanese restaurants were awarded stars. 
Five restaurants in Hollywood had stars.
Five in Beverly Hills.
Twenty-seven total.
Reading over the list, and realizing its distinct lack of high praise for the abundant and excellent multi-cultural food in Los Angeles, I felt my adoration for the Michelin guide fade. It was clear that, despite a newfound dedication to value the many facets of Los Angeles, Michelin had settled back into a safe, stereotypical view of the city. 
Heavy on classic fine dining, sushi and celebrity chefs, the star system neglected many of L.A.’s best restaurants for being too casual and too cheap. Koreatown and San Gabriel Valley were vastly neglected, despite housing some of the best Korean and Chinese food in the United States, respectively. The absence of Thai legends like Jitlada, Sapp Coffee Shop and Night + Market from the Bib Gourmand was felt.
The 2019 Michelin Guide for Los Angeles is an unfortunate regurgitation of the city’s food stereotypes. While it provided the long-overdue global validation for L.A. as a burgeoning culinary destination, its one and two-star lists fell flat in its representation of the city’s ethnic pockets. 
Perhaps I am biased, and perhaps the lack of a three-star restaurant (Vespertine deserved it) struck me as unfair, but Los Angeles does not need a Michelin guide to highlight exceptional dining. Guides like Jonathan Gold’s did all the work of a Michelin Guide and then some, pointing locals toward hole-in-the-wall restaurants, encouraging citywide exploration, and saving small eateries in the process. 
Although I am no seasoned Michelin Inspector, I do love food. Specifically, the food I’ve eaten in Los Angeles, bursting with flavor, sometimes dripping with grease, savored in late-night darkness with a cohort of Angelenos unfit for the entertainment industry. It’s food from heritage, made by families, or freshly independent cooks, or experimental scientists. It’s passion and skill with the exceptional sunniness found only in Los Angeles, a city I love, and a city I’ll continue to explore — no Michelin Guide needed.

As with most summers, many USC students have moved to big cities around the world to get a taste of the post-college work life through internships. At their best, these experiences can shape and inform career paths. Unpaid internships, however, hinder students’ career prospects, often forcing students who are unable to afford housing, travel and other costs  to forgo work opportunities important for success in their careers. 
Though USC has several summer funding scholarships for unpaid internships, the University must continue to expand access to these resources and assist low-income students.
Even if a student does manage to receive one of these scholarships, most only offer between $1,500 and $2,000, which is definitely not enough to even cover housing over the summer. L.A. apartment rates exceed $1,000 per month, by conservative estimates, and housing in cities like San Francisco and New York cost even more. Most internships run for 10 or more weeks, so a $2,000 stipend wouldn’t even cover rent alone. 
Internships often require students to work just as much as entry-level employees, yet $2,000 spread over ten forty-hour work weeks equates to an hourly help of $5.
Factor in costs incurred for food and transportation and pursuing an unpaid internship becomes next to impossible for some students. 
This creates a notable divide between students who can and cannot afford to live on their own and fund the first few steps of their careers. Students from wealthy families don’t have to worry about the cost of their internship because their families can support them financially. Low-income students don’t have the same privilege. Internships don’t come with the same financial aid available during the school year, forcing them to skip these opportunities to instead work at a job that pays the bills. Furthermore, unpaid internships tend to discourage students who hope to work in public service-oriented sectors. Most nonprofits and government offices only offer unpaid internships, making it difficult for students who want to pursue politics and advocacy in their careers. 
Even outside of the public service sector, The Washington Post reports that 43% of internships are unpaid in the for-profit realm. 
In an ambitious academic and professional environment like USC, securing an internship, paid or unpaid, feels especially necessary. Professors and professional schools turn to practical experience as instructional guidance. Meanwhile, the length of a student’s resume becomes a measuring stick to compare their progress against their peers, inextricably linking internship experience to self-worth.
USC, to its credit, appears to have more robust options for funding undergraduate internships than its peer institutions, offering funding through diverse channels across campus for students from many backgrounds, such as the First-Generation Scholarship and the USC Gateway Scholarship Program. However, increasing the size and accessibility of these funds must become a priority. 
Current industry culture promotes unpaid internships as normal or even beneficial to students, and USC has a responsibility to even the playing field for their students as securing and completing internships becomes just as important as college education itself.

The Interfraternity Council released its semester report outlining improvements to Greek life, including an enhanced recruitment process and an emphasis on community involvement.
“In the past 5 to 10 years, USC has gotten more heavy-handed in how they’ve operated judicially,” said Jack Elliott, IFC’s executive vice president of judicial affairs. “We’ve seen that not just with Greek life, but all over the place. A big goal for us was rebuilding relations.”
A Daily Trojan investigation revealed issues between IFC and Student Judicial Affairs and Community Standards following a year of USC investigations into hazing allegations and policy misconduct. Issues concerning how SJACS handled investigations and alleged misconduct of judicial proceedings contributed to these problems.
“The relationship between IFC and the University is one of mutual respect,” IFC President Matteo Mendoza said in response to the Daily Trojan article.
Internal changes detailed in IFC’s report include a revised recruitment process involving formal house tours, where interested students meet the members of each house and tour the building, as well as a reframing of the IFC Health and Wellness position to improve the development of IFC members and encourage closer relationships with each new member educator.
Externally, IFC continued discussions with the Office of Equity and Inclusion and other Trojan Greek councils about improving diversity training that addresses race and gender representation and ethics. 
“We’re going to be bringing in some speakers and seminars in the fall to help educate people on [topics] you don’t necessarily [learn] in school,” Elliott said.
Additionally, IFC said it seeks to expand its philanthropic efforts by joining the Panhellenic Council for four service days at Union Rescue Mission, the largest private homeless shelter in the country.
“We wanted to be able to find an opportunity for organized service on a very large scale in the local area,” Mendoza said. “We are trying to more institutionally partner chapters with their national service or philanthropic organization.”
More than 40 members attended each service day. IFC hopes over 100 members attend each session during future service events.
The Daily Trojan investigation also revealed a culture of hazing within Greek life, with a former Sigma Alpha Mu member claiming pledges anticipated being hazed. 
Mendoza said students expecting to be hazed are not joining Greek life for the right reasons.
“Students should not feel as though this idea of hazing is something that they can expect or that is normalized,” Mendoza said.
According to IFC’s Constitution and bylaws, each fraternity must fully comply with state and University hazing policies. Carlos Ascencio, a freshman majoring in biological sciences, said his fraternity, Pi Kappa Alpha, has been very receptive to the recent hazing allegations. 
“[Pi Kappa Alpha] takes [hazing] concerns seriously,” Ascensio said.  “[They] acknowledged that you can go too far and [disrespect the pledges] because of that.”
IFC, the Office of Fraternity and Sorority Leadership Development and the Office of Student Affairs have discussed hazing policy changes and restructuring new member education.
The Office of Student Affairs implemented the fraternity and sorority priority timeline in Spring 2019, which provides guidelines for policy alterations and future applications. 
Alongside general fire and event planning safety changes, the Fraternity and Sorority Safety Priorities outlines summer plans to “start mapping [alcohol and sexual abuse] prevention education for 2019-20 for all five communities” that are slated to take effect next fall. The five communities include the IFC, Panhellenic Council, Multicultural Greek Council, Asian Greek Council and National Panhellenic Council. 
According to the timeline, these priorities were well-discussed and reviewed. 
With these new changes taking place and an emphasis on new member education and safety, Mendoza believes Greek life is becoming a healthier environment for students.
“Students should feel much safer moving forward,” Mendoza said.

In the first few minutes of Joe Talbot’s 2019 film “The Last Black Man in San Francisco,” best friends Jimmie and Mont are doubled up precariously on a skateboard, cruising alongside the water toward the Fillmore district. Small waves from the bay lap up onto the rocks under a crystal blue sky, clear enough to see the Golden Gate Bridge and even beyond. It is one of those moments that proclaims how San Francisco is just as much as a state of mind as New York. 
“The Last Black Man in San Francisco” is a timely film about loss and fear of erasure in the Bay Area, a location that has seen the influx of tech giants steadily correlate with the rise of tent cities in San Francisco. Industrialization is an overwhelming reality taking over the Bay Area; a recent study from Wealth-X found that one out of every 11,600 people in San Francisco is a billionaire.
“The Last Black Man” — which won both Special Jury and Directing awards at this year’s Sundance Film Festival — weaves the complex feelings of displacement together in a story about a young black man trying to find his place in his home city that has shut him out. After spending most of his life on his own, Jimmie Fails (playing himself) moved in with his gentle best friend Mont (Jonathan Majors) who dreams of being a playwright and Mont’s sweet, going-blind grandfather (Danny Glover) in a cramped house in Bayview-Hunters Point. 
The friends travel by Jimmie’s skateboard and the city bus into the Fillmore District, making daily trips to a San Franciscan-styled Victorian home. It is the house that his grandfather built where Jimmie and his extended family lived during Jimmie’s childhood, the place that, according to family lore, his grandfather built with his bare hands. When the story opens, the house is owned by an older white couple, but Jimmie frequents the property with tools and paintbrushes, upkeeping the garden and trim as if he is the caretaker. Eventually (and much to Jimmie’s joy) it becomes empty when the owners get sucked into a family conflict. 
Jimmie’s dream of living in the house becomes a reality when he and Mont sneak into the empty property and make it their own. The cinematography is particularly striking here: soft silhouettes of the friends in the intricate wooden hallways, backlit from the bright light of the outdoors, keeping them safe from the city where inequality is too harsh to face. 
“The Last Black Man” is based on the real Jimmie’s experiences and was made possible by funding from Kickstarter. As he and Talbot became close, they started playing with the idea of a screenplay that made poignant commentaries on race, class and the housing crisis in San Francisco.
“It’s really our friendship that kind of made this movie happen,” Talbot told Deadline in a recent article. “The movie came out of us just walking around the city as friends. It’s such a great walking city, so that became sort of a ritual for us.”
Jimmie and Mont’s friendship is the beacon of hope in the film’s haunting narrative and a striking commentary on the hypermasculinity of black men. The intimacy between the two is hauntingly beautiful.
“The Last Black Man in San Francisco” offers no solutions to gentrification, but raises the questions around displacement. When you leave somewhere that you deem special, how are you remembered? Perhaps more importantly, how do you find a home in a city that pushes you out?
