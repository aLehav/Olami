The Undergraduate Student Government discussed semester and year-long goals at Tuesday night’s senate meeting. 
Chief programming officer Jillian Fallon started off the meeting by presenting programming goals aimed to engage more students at different stages of planning and attending events. 
“For this semester, I want to give everyone a strong foundation to start off the year,” Fallon said. “Not only am I meeting with everyone one-on-one, but we also have weekly meetings through our programming department meeting or breakout at organization-wide meetings, just to make sure everyone’s on the same page.”
Afterwards, president Hannah Woodworth said that there was a lot of USG work being done over the summer to plan for the school year. 
“We ran a lot of big ideas, but how can we tailor this and refine it to become something that is actually possible?” Woodworth said. “I’m determining what our advocacy initiatives were and what we thought would be feasible within this year, and then picking and prioritizing them…and really finding two or three core priorities that we want to say at the end of this year, we did it.” 
Woodworth then presented the current projects that USG will work on, including providing a shuttle between USC and Los Angeles International Airport, which USG approved $63,000 in rollover funding this summer to pay and fund a pilot program for this year. They are still working to improve shuttle contracts, conducting qualitative interviews with registered student organizations and posting more frequently on their social media platforms. 
“There’s a barrier to entry to get to LAX,” Woodworth said. “Oftentimes, Ubers are more expensive than your flight. We’re going to try and make sure that this is a collective effort that hopefully stays beyond this year.”
USG also plans to collect more information about the Interfraternity Council disaffiliation, meeting with student advocacy groups about student affordability and establish working relationships with Student Basic Needs. Additional plans include completing a  qualitative analysis on the registered student organizations’ perception of USG, exhausting the USG fund to not have rollover, and increasing social media engagement by 15%.
“We want to do everything we can to support the organization and spend [the fund] to its fullest capacity,” Woodworth said. “[We want to] specifically support our programming branch to make it easy and accessible for them to use this fund.”
Vice president Nivea Krishnan announced the legislative branch’s annual goals, including increasing peer-to-peer communication such as the tabling events that senators will begin next week on Trousdale Parkway to expand accessibility for students outside of USG and establish USG as the go-to for student services and university resources. 
“This past week, we have senators who have been doing an initiative where we’ve been going into classes,” said senator Maria Barun. “We’ve been reaching out to past professors that we have a connection with, and just saying, ‘Can you give me two minutes at the start of your class so I can introduce myself and give students my email and to reach out if they have any questions?’”
USG’s active external projects also include workshops with the Gould School of Law to put together a training series on student tenant rights and how to navigate the housing process, establishing a clear network for RSOs to resolve internal disputes about Relationship and Sexual Violence Prevention and Diversity, Equity and Inclusion, administrative roundtables for groups to discuss with administrators to discuss important campus issues and launching a new meal swipes donation program by workshopping a new version of Trojans Give Back.
“[The meal swipe donation program] is something that we had a really good version of last year,” Krishnan said. “We raised over $12,000 via that program for students in need, but they did change the meal plans so we’re going to have to rework that. USC dining has been very receptive in the past, so we’re hoping that this semester we can redesign the program.”
Chief diversity officer Zaid Diaz-Arias presented goals to expand recruitment, implement diversity training, ensure equity in the budget, expand advocacy and amplify the advocacy department’s role.
“I aim to be the principal architect of USG’s diversity, equity and inclusion plans and programs,” Diaz-Arias said. “The advocacy department was created because we wanted to alleviate the extra responsibility on the assemblies to focus on advocacy at the same time that they’re focusing on programming.”
The budget was restructured to make sure that funding is distributed fairly, and students who are a part of RSOs will be able to attend a funding workshop Wednesday, Sept. 7 at 6 p.m. to learn about the funding department and how their organizations can get financing. More information about the workshops will follow on their Instagram. 
“The mission of the funding department is to promote community development, personal growth and organizational trust through transparent investments and equitable access to opportunity,” chief financial officer Brian Stowe said.

Following the disaffiliation of eight of the 15 chapters of USC’s Interfraternity Council to form the new, independent University Park Interfraternity Council, some alumni have shared their desire for continued partnership between fraternities and the University and expressed support for freshmen who want to be able to rush during their first semester.
Since 2018, the University has enforced a deferred recruitment policy, which prohibits first-semester freshmen from rushing a fraternity in their fall semester in the hopes of allowing new students one semester to focus more closely on University academics and social activities. As part of this policy, students interested in joining a fraternity or sorority must complete a minimum of 12 academic units at USC earning a minimum 2.50 grade point average before they can join.
Alumni from the Kappa Alpha and Zeta Beta Tau, which are both disaffiliated, expressed their hope for fraternities to continue working with the University.
Bart Leddel, class of 1963, an alumnus of ZBT and former president of the student body in 1962 said that “the University should care about all kids in all areas.”
“Fraternities did a good job [in the past]… working with the University and that’s the way it should be now,” Leddel said.
Michael Paulin, class of 1963, an alumnus of Kappa Alpha and former fraternities affairs advisor at USC, echoed this concern. Paulin said he recognized that the disaffiliation of the fraternities was “very unfortunate,” and that he would “like to see everybody  on the same page,” citing greater open dialogue as a way to mend relations between the University and the disaffiliated fraternities. 
However, both also mentioned a larger issue they were more concerned with — the policy prohibiting first-semester freshmen from joining fraternities. 
Paulin noted that USC “stands alone” in this policy, compared with other California schools like UCLA, UCSD and UC Irvine which allow first-semester freshmen to rush fraternities. Paulin will be in discussion with University administration on the topic.
“Fraternities provide an important outlet for [incoming freshmen] to have the first opportunity to coalesce as brothers and feel open amongst each other to be able to discuss problems or issues or emotions,” Paulin said. “That does not really exist in the dormitory environment… or [for] commuter student[s].”
Another more structural reason to allow first-semester freshman to rush, according to Paulin, was the large number of students in fraternities that study abroad in their upperclassmen years, leading to a vacuum in fraternity leadership. 
“It is important to rush incoming freshmen to be able to develop the leadership skills in these fraternities … as the ones who guide the future of the organization,” Paulin said.
In a statement issued by Sigma Chi Grand Praetor Harry Palmer to Sigma Chi alumni, he addressed its move to disaffiliate from the University. 
Palmer cited the mandated deferred recruitment policy and the suspension of nearly all organized activities of USC Interfraternity Council members for alleged policy violations last October for more than 90 days, including chapters in good standing, as reasons behind its move.
In the same statement, Sigma Chi said that these policies resulted in a “significant reduction” in the overall size of the fraternity community at the University, even though USC admitted that there was “no data” proving deferring recruitment had a positive effect on students. 
“We expect that USC will attempt to raise false concerns in the areas of student health and safety,” Palmer wrote. “But Alpha Upsilon is and has long been a chapter in good standing at USC.”
Both Palmer and Paulin also cited various studies to support their claims. These included Dr. Gary Pike’s, of Indiana University, which found that the benefits of collaborative learning in fraternities were especially beneficial to first-year students, as well as the 2021 Gallup study, which found that members of Greek organizations tended to be more successful later in life.

TWICE has consistently been one of the highest-performing South Korean girl groups since their contract began in 2015 — releasing hits like “The Feels,” which peaked at #83 on Billboard’s Global 200 Chart, along with an astounding 10 million records (and counting) sold internationally.
Despite such profound success, the expiration of their seven-year contract crept closer, and many fans were on edge as they awaited either a contract renewal or a disbandment announcement. 
To everyone’s relief, all nine members of TWICE renewed their contract with JYP Entertainment in July, and TWICE wasted no time in teasing new music for ONCE, the name they use to lovingly refer to their fanbase, as they released their new Japanese album, “Celebrate,” two weeks later. 
In what felt like a whirlwind following the release of their eldest member Nayeon’s solo debut, “Im Nayeon” and “Celebrate,” advertisements for “BETWEEN 1&2” began as early as Aug. 4. In a fun and futuristic, yet mature concept trailer, members of TWICE left ONCE wondering what their upcoming mini-album would entail. TWICE is known for their super sweet, bubble gum pop sound, but has generally graduated from their initial cutesy beginnings in recent years.
Even so, this trailer hinted at a healthy balance between a youthful, trendy aesthetic and an age appropriate — even sexy — concept. So, the countdown to Aug. 26 began, and JYP spared no expense in producing various collections of the members in Y2K-inspired outfits and in contrastingly serious, yet alluring photos.
With the excitement of back-to-back albums and the contract renewal, ONCE have come to support TWICE in an incredible way — making “BETWEEN 1&2” the most pre-ordered TWICE release ever, according to Apple Music. Thankfully, their newest release did not disappoint.
“Talk that Talk”
The much anticipated title track is reminiscent of summer — the lighthearted and somewhat nostalgic melody is easy to listen to, and certainly has “earworm” potential where members Sana and Momo sing in the refrain: “lyrics lyrics lyrics.” TWICE often puts their bubble gum pop roots to use, and this becomes evident in the chorus where we hear the characteristic TWICE “sound.” They also surprisingly reference their Nov. 2018 release, “YES or YES,” slipping a “yes or yes?” into their lyrics in the [refrain/pre-chorus?] With such a catchy track, it’s easy to find oneself mouthing along to the song.
“Basics”
Member Chaeyoung is credited as a lyricist on this track, and she does a great job of pulling together unique lyrics that fit the fast-paced and modern feel of the song. Although a friend and fellow ONCE was only able to describe “Basics” as something that “feels good on the brain,” the beat, style and harmonization seems like a faster paced version of Ariana Grande’s “thank u, next” era — something that may or may not be a coincidence considering what Chaeyoung said when asked about who she’d like to collaborate with: “Ariana Grande, I really love her. Jihyo, Nayeon and I did a cover at our concert.”
“When We Were Kids”
Member Dahyun contributed the lyrics to this sweet ode to childhood. As one of the only slower and more serious songs on the mini-album, this track has a contemplative feel to it as the members sing about revisiting the past: “I wish that I could meet / Could meet the younger me.” 
Despite the relatively simple message and construction of the song, it was accompanied by beautiful and dreamy swells in the music with the help of talented lead vocalists, Nayeon and Jihyo, in the chorus.
Despite only covering three out of the seven songs on the mini-album, rest assured that there are plenty of talking points to go on about — this is only for the sake of working with the word limit. TWICE has once again matched people’s expectations on the first listen; though it’s always a good sign when artists are trying new approaches to music, this mini-album incorporates a lot of core aspects that create the distinctive “TWICE” sound without limiting itself  at the same time. This is all to say that it’ll be very exciting to see what TWICE will do with the time that their new contract has afforded them.

It is the seminal question in any self-respecting “small-talk” starter pack: 
“So… what kind of music do you like?” 
Often, it feels like a bit of a trap. No matter what you answer, it feels as though you’re giving people the ammunition to size you up in a second. 
For instance, let’s say you go with the trusty “Oh, I like a little bit of everything” response. Seems like a safe bet. No one can pigeonhole or judge you, right? Wrong. This is the musical equivalent of saying you’re “good with anything” when someone asks you what you want to eat. Don’t be that guy. 
Next time this question comes up in conversation (as it inevitably will) and you want to earn some street cred, try responding with the following: “Have you ever heard of Phoebe Bridgers?” 
On Saturday, Aug. 28, Bridgers returned to her native California on her long-awaited “Reunion Tour,” the audience peppered with teenage girls clad in Doc Martens and cool dads sporting skeleton onesies (Bridger’s outfit of choice). 
Many Pharbz — the name that Bridgers fans have proudly bestowed upon themselves — proved their devotion to the artist this past weekend at the Vina Robles Amphitheatre in Paso Robles. Bridgers’ album “Punisher” was released during the pandemic and gained traction with every passing moment, as it provided a soothing backdrop of songs for the cataclysmic period we were collectively experiencing. The irony of the album’s title was not lost, as this was the only reward for the punishment of isolation we were made to endure during this unforeseen calamity.
As “Punisher” played out in its entirety, with the occasional single or track from Bridgers’ first record, “Stranger in the Alps,” sprinkled in, the audience seemed to be acutely aware of the fact that they were no longer listening to these songs alone in their bedrooms. To hear a crowd of thousands singing along to each melancholic melody after a year spent in isolation was soul-stirring, to say the least. It was a brief eternity that soaked into the very bones of every spectator.
There are far too many ways to describe the platinum blonde indie rock songstress who took the internet by storm during the coronavirus pandemic, and yet not nearly enough. 
The internet has humorously characterized her as “Taylor Swift for girls who told kids on the playground that ‘Ring Around the Rosie’ is actually about the black plague.” Sir Elton John described her sophomore effort, “Punisher,” as one of the “reference points” in his life, and joked that he would “hit someone” if she didn’t win at least one of the four Grammys she was nominated for. She’s been deemed a “trailblazer” by Billboard — and received an award to match — at this year’s Women in Music event. 
Bridgers’ influence isn’t limited to music, however. For someone so fond of ghosts (her merchandise is practically a phantom playground), Bridgers is seemingly everywhere. She recently joined the cast of the upcoming A24 horror film “I Saw the TV Glow” from director Jane Schoenbrun, and  teamed up with Los Angeles restaurant HomeState to create a vegan taco benefitting a child welfare charity.
In spite of her renaissance woman reputation, Bridgers shines most brightly in her songwriting career. She is arguably one of the hottest musicians of the 21st century, with her five-star reviews from Rolling Stone and NME — among several other publications — backing that claim.
For many, Bridgers’ voice provides comfort during moments of quiet, making a day, a week, and, eventually, an entire year spent home alone feel a little less lonely. Thematically, Bridgers has compared “Punisher” to “a diary about your crush during the apocalypse” – a 40-minute auditory odyssey that successfully conveys how many of us feel like our problems take precedence over legitimate turmoil. 
It’s a fitting description for someone who sings about “[romanticizing] a quiet life.” Bridgers’ music is an assortment of folk and bedroom pop that simultaneously manages to be both haunting and undeniably comforting, like a warm mug of apple cider amid the eeriness of Halloween. 
There is a singular moment at the end of every single Bridgers show that, for those who have been lucky enough to experience it, is nothing short of cathartic. 
As she launches into the apocalyptic metal folk ballad “I Know the End” that marks, well, the end of “Punisher,” the trumpets build, the drums kick in, and the audience releases  guttural, barbaric screams that could power a thousand suns. 
Perhaps it is the pent-up communal frustration or simply a singularly beautiful expression of solidarity in the face of emotional strife. Whatever the case, it marks the conclusion of a concert unlike any other, where things fall apart and candidly come back together over the course of a single evening.  
So, the next time the inescapable question is posed, you can confidently talk about Miss Bridgers. Perhaps that will suggest that you are prone to bouts of sadness or have merely discovered a highly effective form of free therapy. More than anything, though, it says that you are in touch with your feelings – however messy or uncertain they may be – and love it when those feelings are transformed into really good art.   
Now, this might be awkward, but in the spirit of fair small-talk etiquette, the question has to be asked…
What kind of music do you like?

On Friday, I was FaceTiming my very sexy boyfriend (a necessary detail) and I started to joke, “This time last semester I was…” But before I could even finish my sentence, he cut me off. 
“No! Don’t say it!” he exclaimed, as if saying it would open Pandora’s satanic box all over again. 
I laughed and said it anyway because it’s true: on the first Friday of the Spring semester, I was hospitalized with sepsis, and would be twice more.
On a Friday in January, doctors found bacteria in my bloodstream and diagnosed me with sepsis, an extreme full-body response to the infection spreading throughout my body, which can be life-threatening.  
Doctors deduced that the bitch that’d double crossed me was my port-a-cath, the implanted device that I rely on for my life sustaining medication. It’s something cancer patients use for frequent IV access. I stick a big-ass needle into my chest to access a tube going to my heart. Some normal bacteria on the skin latched onto the plastic Port as their host and gradually grew, slowly infecting me. 
You may be wondering, “Catherine, what’s this five-star experience like?” Picture yourself on 24/7 IV drips of antibiotics with fatigue so crushing you’re basically Tom Cruise pulling Top Gun 10 G’s, waiting for the antibiotics to clap back against the bacteria. 
Back at school, I was sending out mass emails to all my professors like, “I know we’re just getting to know each other, but I’m in the hospital and not sure when I’ll get out.” I wasn’t prepared for the ensuing five month sepsis saga that went a little something like this:
January: I Zoom into classes from my hospital bed. I’m only released after fighting with my doctors over removing the port. They wanted to preserve it hoping the at-home IV antibiotics would eliminate the infection. I wanted that fucker out, but they refused.
February: I drag myself to classes only to crash again 24 hours after finishing my antibiotics.
March: I’m septic again and hospitalized at a different hospital where my cardiologist promptly slices out the infected port. He places a peripherally inserted central catheter instead. I’m discharged with more at-home IV antibiotics, relieved to spend time at home recuperating. 
A week later, it’s April, and the fever returns. This time I’m not taking any chances. We yank the PICC out and my crumbling body collapses into spring break. Finally…
HAH, YOU THOUGHT THIS SHIT WAS OVER? Without skipping a beat, the last day of finals in May my body gives out and I’m hospitalized again for a major lupus flare.
Recently, I learned one of my improv classmates thought I was just a too-cool-for-school kid who “rolled up whenever I wanted,” when really I was an infected meat sack masking it all with a smile. My smile hid the eight hours a day I spent resting in my room only to use the energy I’d saved up to take a shower. It hid the weeks of nausea when I only ate saltines and ginger ale and the dropping two inches in my pants size. It hid weeks of disassociation with reality and crippling anxiety as I lived in constant fear of another hospitalization if I were to attempt anything that brought me joy. As a result, I have very little memory of those five months. 
During these five months, my mom and boyfriend traded weekends from San Diego to Los Angeles to help me function. For months those closest to me took my teary phone calls, remaining strong for me when I couldn’t take it anymore. Teachers, nurses, my talk therapist, physical therapists, doctors and OSAS case managers helped carry me along. Despite all the love, I feel guilty saying I still had days, weeks, months, of feeling hopeless and alone. 
Now, on the other side of all that suffering, I learned that everything else in life can wait for your health. Your worth is not dependent on how productive you are, it is based on the kind of person you are. Your thoughts are not your reality. Take an incomplete, or three, like me. Your friends, family, doctors and school will understand. If they don’t, I always will. You are doing enough. You are enough. Just as you are today, the next day, and so on. 
As to why I didn’t drop out? It’s because doctors assured me I’d rebound quickly with my antibiotics, and around every corner I sincerely believed that the finish line was in sight. We all did.
But my semester of sepsis was also like living in a slow motion car crash, and asking why I didn’t drop out would be like asking a person who got in a car crash, “Why did you get in the car?” because that’s the thing with chronic illness, you’re constantly at the whim of your body, it comes with the gig. When the inevitable happens, you’re forced to march forward. Yet, despite the trauma of my spring semester, I never gave up. I refused to. Even on my darkest days I chose to fight on –– a phrase I unironically latched onto during this time. 
I tell this story to highlight the unnoticed disabled student experience on campus. I owe my Spring semester to my support system. I’m so fucking proud of myself. And with that, BITCH IT’S MY SENIOR YEAR, I MADE IT!! YOU WON’T BREAK MY SOULLLL!!!

I can’t even recall the number of times my period surprised me with a lovely early visit right before class, and I didn’t have a single pad or tampon on me. Thank you to all the lovely people who saved my ass in said situations, but there were also times I had to resort to a makeshift toilet paper pad because the menstrual cycle dispensers were out or I didn’t have a quarter on me. Most of the time, I would just run home because I panicked at the thought of blood seeping through my pants and the rash I would get if I waited through my class to get a tampon.
The first time that happened, I cried in the stalls of my high school bathroom and got a warning slip for being late to class.
But I never understood why this was the case. Why do I have to buy menstrual products at school? Why do I have to constantly come to class prepared for a breakthrough bleed at all times? I can’t control it and in some months, neither can my birth control. 
If any of this sounds repetitive, it’s because it is. On the Daily Trojan website, there are 40 articles relating to menstrual products, most of which say the same thing: students should not have to pay for having their period. Tampons and pads are not a luxury. How many times do we have to say it? How would you feel if you had to pay every time you went to the bathroom?
Organizations on campus such as the Undergraduate Student Government, ResEd and, most recently, the Viterbi Graduate Student Association have all worked on pilot projects to provide free and accessible menstrual products on campus for students. And yet, it feels as though none of these projects ever last. They either fail due to supply and demand, or fizzle out as leaders of said projects move onto greener pastures. 
According to the USG Advocacy Project Tracker, the Free the Tampon expansion project has been completed, but if that were the case, the Viterbi GSA wouldn’t have needed to start their own project.
But at the end of the day, it shouldn’t be any student organization’s responsibility to find ways for students to have access to menstrual products. It is the University’s responsibility. 
If the University can provide us with toilet paper, soap, paper towels and seat covers, they can find a way to stretch their operating revenue of $5.4 billion to cover menstrual products for students. Universities such as Brown and Emory have been doing it for years, so why hasn’t USC?
But if we truly want to compare, Governor Gavin Newson signed the Menstrual Equity For All Act of 2021 last October, mandating that all public schools and universities must provide free menstrual products by the start of the 2022-2023 school year.
While USC is not a public university, the University is still falling behind in providing adequate support for all of its students, as nearly all other schools in California are recognizing that feminine healthcare products are a necessity, not an option.
While we all have to buy our own toilet paper and soap at home, those who unfortunately get that nasty little red visitor every month or so have to pay around an additional $18,000 over their lifetimes over something they physically cannot avoid. The University might not think $18,000 is a lot of money, considering cost of attendance is between roughly $75,000 to $85,000, but not having to buy a tampon or pad on campus would not just be an enormous mental stress relief for students — it would also relieve major financial stress for many.
I’ve been physically struggling with regulating my menstrual cycle and complained to my roommate about how much I’ve had to spend on tampons lately. I’ll spare you the gory and painful details of what having a period every month is like, but she recommended investing in a menstrual cup to save money. While she isn’t wrong that it definitely would be cheaper, everyone who has to go through a menstrual cycle shouldn’t have to find alternatives or macgyver a pad out of toilet paper in a case of financial or physical emergency. 
Not being able to access free menstrual products speaks to a much larger issue in our society, but let’s start with our University. I’m begging you, USC, please make living with a uterus a bit easier on campus.

Progress is the name of the game for the women’s cross country team, which is looking to continue its growth trajectory and strengthen its relatively young roster this season.
“[The team] is young and inexperienced; that’s just what we have,” said associate head coach Jebreh Harris. “So we have to take all the positives that we can, keep building culturally, keep improving performance-wise.”
Historically, the Trojans have finished at the bottom of the Pac-12 conference, though a squad of five athletes qualified for the NCAA West Regional last season — putting them in the team scoring competition for the first time since 2014. 
Two of those five runners have since graduated, but a core squad of returners remains this season.
Only one senior who ran on the West Regional squad sits on the roster this season: Mihajla Milovanovic. The junior transfer from Loyola University Chicago crossed the finish line second for the Trojans last year at the regional meet — behind the now-graduated Alyssa Brewer — finishing 111th overall with a 6k time of 22:06.
In the 2022 outdoor track season, Milovanovic posted the team’s fastest times in the 3k and 5k (10:20 and 17:55, respectively). 
Also returning are sophomores Giovanna Pisano, Gigi Maccagnini and Maya Lacamp. 
Pisano finished first for the team at the Pac-12 championship last season (66th overall, 23:09 6k), and Maccagnini — the team’s fastest 1500m runner in 2022 (4:25) — was the first Trojan to cross the line in the first two meets that same season. Lacamp was also a consistent scorer for the squad in the 2021 cross country season.
Harris pointed to Pisano and senior Brooke Rodi as the team’s most vocal leaders. 
“[Pisano] is the one who motivates the most,” Harris said. “She’s a great cheerleader for her teammates, so she has been taking a lot of the [brunt] of the emotional energy and motivation of the team.”
Three new freshmen join the squad this year, and could very well mix it up with the returners. Perhaps the most decorated of those three is Ashlee Gallegos of Rancho Mission Viejo, Calif.
Gallegos helped JSerra Catholic win the 2021 California state (Division IV) high school cross country meet, with a 19:49, 67th-overall 5k finish on the famous Woodward Park circuit. A week later, she ran an 18:58 for a 19th overall finish at the NXR California Regional Championships on the same course.
During the 2022 track season, she posted a 2:16.22 for an 11th place finish in the 800m state final. Her personal record is a 2:10.18.
“She is familiar with winning,” Harris said of Gallegos. “She’s one of the top middle distance runners in the state of California coming out of last year, so we are grateful to have her … an athlete who wants to work, who wants to train, who wants to contribute.”
Fellow freshman Lucy Westlake of Naperville, Ill. — who also just so happens to be the youngest American woman to climb Mount Everest — has quite a bit of hardware herself.
In the 2021 cross country season, Westlake finished 9th at the Illinois (3A) state cross country championships with a 3 mile time of 16:55. She then went on to place 41st at the NXR Midwest Regional Championships (19:32 5k) and 39th at the Garmin RunningLane Cross Country Championships (17:22 5k).
“Her cross country team in high school is one of the strongest teams in the state of Illinois,” Harris said. “So she is used to a championship team type of mentality.” 
Harris also noted that Westlake’s mountain climbing “toughness” shows itself during workouts. 
Also joining the Trojan squad is Liyat Kebbede of Niskayuna, N.Y. Another decorated runner, Harris said that Kebbede suffered injuries in her senior year of high school that kept her from racing much.
But she’s still got plenty to show. In her sophomore year, Kebbede ran a 28th place, 19:30 5k at the New York state cross country championships. She followed that up with a 34th place finish at the NXR Northeast & New York Regional Championships. 
On the track, Kebbede holds outdoor personal bests of 10:08 in the 3k and 4:44 in the 5k.
The first meet of the season — the Mark Covert Invitational — is fast approaching on Sept. 3. 
“The goal for [Mark Covert], honestly, is one thing I’ve been talking about at practice,” Harris said. “Really getting out that first mile, settling in and also just working together. I just want a good pack.”
Ultimately, the team will aim to peak in late October when the first elimination competition, the Pac-12 championship, begins.
“September is pretty much like … a pre-competitive season of sorts,” Harris said. “You’re building, figuring each other out, working hard, putting a lot of good groundwork in and chemistry building with the other races.”
Earlier this month, the team traveled to Mammoth Lakes for a three-day training camp, which Harris credited for cultivating the team culture. He noted that he thinks the team has built off of last year in cultivating “good energy.”
Moving forward, Harris identified continued progress as a key goal for the team this year.
“We may not have scored so much in the past years in cross country,” he said. “I’m not saying it’s about to be some big, major 180, but progress is progress.”

Across the college athletics world, boosters have had an important role in school programs. For instance, Phil Knight, co-founder of Nike, has infused hundreds of millions of dollars into his alma mater University of Oregon and their teams to keep the Ducks competitive in Division I athletics. Yet, even though boosters have played a crucial part in sustaining and improving college athletic programs, there has been recent controversy in their relationship with name, image and likeness (NIL) deals. 
Ever since NIL deals were approved last year, the college athletics world has been in chaos – especially in major sports like college football. Along with coaching staff, school prestige, and many other factors, the value of NIL deals now plays an important role for potential recruits and brings a new investment opportunity for boosters. 
According to the NCAA, boosters are known as “any third-party entity that promotes an athletics program, assists with recruiting or assists with providing benefits to recruits, enrolled student-athletes or their family members,” so any individuals and collectives they form to help pay student athletes for NIL deals would be included in this definition. 
These boosters have taken advantage of NIL and the transfer portal to get top established players to come to their schools. One example can be seen here at USC with reigning Biletnikoff winner and All-American wide receiver Jordan Addison coming to Southern California from Pittsburgh. Rumors about his transfer to USC were made even before he was officially in the transfer portal, causing concern over the role boosters have had in his eventual transfer to the Trojans.
Addison’s move instigated the NCAA to start taking action against boosters and collectives for manipulating NIL deals in May. Boosters are now not allowed to have contact with student athletes and their families before they have committed to a university. 
This viewpoint was emphasized by CEO of NIL management company Athliance Peter Schoenthal, who said, “I think the Jordan Addison situation clearly was one of the straws that was, ‘OK, enough is enough,’” in an interview with TribLive.com. 
Furthermore, boosters have not only been using the transfer portal for their NIL deals, as high school recruits have been influenced by them also in their decision-making.
Take for instance Texas A&M, which only had an 8-4 record last year. Yet, they ended up having the number one recruiting class for the 2022 season with eight 5-star recruits. Although Texas A&M has been a prestigious program and has a strong head coach in Jimbo Fisher, it isn’t difficult to see that boosters like Monty Davis, COO of earth and oil analysis firm Core Laboratories, had a role in getting these recruits. 
It even got to the point that University of Alabama head coach Nick Saban called out Texas A&M for their recruiting practices. 
“I mean, we [Alabama] were second in recruiting last year,” Saban said in an event with local Birmingham business leaders. “A&M was first. A&M bought every player on their team — made a deal for name, image, likeness.”
These comments sparked controversy with messages exchanged between both the Alabama and A&M camps throughout the summer, but overall, they highlighted the contentious nature of NIL and boosters getting involved. 
Despite all of these issues going on between teams and the NCAA, boosters are still moving forward with their own NIL deals. One such example is with USC.
Although the University does not want to be involved in any more legal issues with the NCAA, the “Student Body Right”  collective, which is made up of rich donors, school alumni, and fans, wants to provide more monetary incentives for players to join their school.
USC already has a school-sponsored NIL organization, BLVD LLC, to manage NIL deals among its student-athletes, so they are not in violation of any rules or regulations. Therefore, they do not want to associate with SBR, with Athletic Director Mike Bohn not even acknowledging their existence. 
As a USC fan, getting the top players for all of our sports does sound appealing at first. However, if the NCAA starts to enforce punishments for schools breaking their NIL rules, these booster collectives start to become worrying. 
Looking forward, it seems that these collectives and boosters will keep working in the shadows to get players to join their schools. It will be interesting to see how universities, the NCAA, and governments will react and challenge them.
