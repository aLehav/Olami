USC needs to be more straightforward about the application process for Problems Without Passports, Maymesters and departmental summer programs. The funding often varies from program to program — due dates and deposit deadlines may be poorly advertised and information about applicable scholarships and grants hard to sift through. Recent financial aid changes under President Carol Folt have made USC more affordable — but the school administration should be doing more to make optional enrichment programs more financially accessible as well. 
Planning for summer courses is understandably complex, and it affects what students can take during the regular semester as well. Maymester classes are included in undergraduate spring tuition, but the University stipulates that only 18 units are included in each semester’s tuition. Taking a four-unit Maymester class means that students can only take 14 units of work during the semester, unless they choose to pay for extra units or have planned far enough in advance to apply for funds like the Academic Achievement Award, which covers three extra units of tuition. 
Unlike Maymesters, departmental summer programs and Problems without Passports, a summer program during which students travel to locations around the world to study transnational issues, are not covered by Spring tuition. Upon acceptance into the course, a student is obligated to pay a $400 deposit to ensure immediate commitment. The University’s website notes that the 2020 summer tuition for a four-unit course is $7,712, and this doesn’t include the estimates of other expenses incurred while abroad. While the University advertises funding opportunities such as the Summer Undergraduate Research Fund, this application-based aid only covers up to $3,000 of program tuition costs. 
To USC’s credit, Dornsife summer programs are inclusive and immersive, with many offered to non-majors or students looking to complete GE credit. However, there is no escaping the inordinate price tag — even the two-unit “Soccer in Brazil” course offered this summer racks up huge costs, estimating that on top of the USC tuition fees and $500 deposit, there could be up to $2,900 in travel and lodging fees. 
USC summer programs are advertised as “experiential learning,” but for a significant percentage of the student population, the amount of disposable income needed to make these experiences a reality is simply not feasible. While there are funds, scholarships and grants available to offset the costs of living and units of tuition, the amounts offered are scattered and confusing, and application timelines are often conspicuously absent. Viterbi School of Engineering’s Summer 2020 program in London is one of the few departmental offerings that even displays a comprehensive timeline of application requirements and deposit deadlines, offering time after program acceptance and financial aid award disbursement, for students to decide to commit to the program before putting down a deposit. In comparison, many of the Dornsife deadlines for the grant applications occur after the application for the summer program is due,  meaning students committed to the program will either lose their deposit fee or are on the hook for several thousand dollars, if they do not receive enough money.
The depth and variety of summer course programs are truly incredible, but students in need of financial assistance are missing out on some of the most unique and immersive opportunities at USC. Summer courses are optional, but many students don’t even have the luxury of a choice — they simply can’t afford it. Many students would be better off spending the summer gaining valuable work or internship experience rather than face an insurmountable mountain of tuition payments, travel and living expenses and hidden fees. Exorbitantly-priced summer classes only further prove that while USC is taking steps in the right direction, it continues to maintain an illusion of affordability.
While it’s understandable that abroad trips require much planning in advance and coordination, the University’s programs need to be more transparent about what students are getting into. By clearly communicating upcoming summer offerings instead of sporadically posting them online, breaking down cost requirements and expectations through information sessions as well as highlighting alternative routes to finance courses, USC can make summer abroad offerings an exciting learning opportunity rather than a stressful, headache-inducing experience as students scramble to find funding and grants to make ends meet.

This just in: apparently the USC administration now cares about diversifying its student body and providing equal opportunity for undergraduate applicants. The news comes in the form of a tuition policy announced by President Carol Folt Feb. 20. The plan, which USC will implement this fall, will cover the full cost of tuition for students whose families make $80,000 or less, regardless of home equity.
From a distance, it’s all very attractive — a pretty present in pretty packaging. First off, the proposition of free tuition is a big deal, and in the context of USC, it’s groundbreaking. The 2019-20 school year saw a 3.5% increase in tuition — a USC education costs a whopping $58,195 compared to the 2018-19 rate of $56,225. 
For many rising high school seniors, the large price tag may as well be a “Keep Out” sign held by Tommy Trojan himself, standing guard at the campus’ pearly gates. The new policy suggests that the University administration has now opened those gates to the likes of mere mortals. And the timing could not be any better. Amid national discussions about free tuition at public institutions, here’s USC — a private university famed for being the “University of Spoiled Children” — suddenly stepping ahead of its peers. 
But don’t get your hopes up. This new move is merely a well-wrapped regift of what was already available. It’s basically a well-dressed lie. 
Folt’s promise of free tuition does not entail free college. According to the most recent records from National Center for Education Statistics, students within the relevant bracket are left to cough up between $15,210 and $29,293 after aid; this includes the cost of housing, meal plans and other mandatory expenses. The new policy will only cover the cost of tuition, leaving students with the same amount to pay out of pocket. 
And the plan certainly does not guarantee a more financially diverse student body. Folt explained the move as an initiative to remove the barrier of financial restrictions to create more opportunity for 
lower-income students’ to enroll at USC. While eliminating the cost of tuition will most likely encourage more low-income students to apply, the resources can’t be used if the affected students can’t get in. 
The path to USC remains an exclusive one. Regardless of the University’s claim of practicing a “holistic” approach to college admissions and without knowing the inner workings of that oh-so-secretive process, candidates for college admission generally need to look good on paper. This means a strong GPA, extracurriculars, demonstrated leadership and respectable test scores. 
The SATs have long been outed as a means of promoting white privilege and classism — to be at the top, there has to be someone at the bottom. Access to quality education, private tutors and study resources — marks of privilege — all contribute to 
testing outcomes. Even in the case of test-optional schools, an applicant who submits test scores might have a better advantage. And while the effects are felt cross-culturally, it’s clear that people of color are disproportionately affected. This boils down to systemic racism. Such inequality will persist until there has been a complete revitalization of how universities assess students’ aptitude. 
One should not overlook the ways USC benefits from this announcement. An increase in applicants does not equate to an increase in acceptances. Hereby we arrive at the truth of the matter: More applications means more rejections, which in turn will decrease USC’s acceptance rate. This seems insignificant, until one recalls the college admissions scandal. 
According to USC admissions data compiled by Inside Higher Ed, 2019 was a year of records: the highest number of applications, the lowest number of admits and the lowest number of deposits in May — months after Operation Varsity Blues broke into the public sphere. While there are many factors influencing college admissions decisions, it’s not out of the realm of possibility that the highly-publicized scandals negatively contributed to the number of deposits. 
Thus, the new tuition policy takes on a different shade of intent. By repackaging USC to seem more attainable, the administration has built a two-fold system in which they themselves are the primary beneficiaries: As the University grows in public esteem and desirability, so will it grow in exclusivity. 
On another note, what about the students that are already enrolled — of the same or similar income bracket — whp are struggling to pay fees? USC is jumping at the chance to better its scandal-ridden image with this attempt at student outreach, but there is little focus on the students already enrolled. There are pages of pages of GoFundMe’s for enrolled students who’ve turned to last resorts to continue their education, while the University administration is playing at inclusion and social awareness. 
As it stands, the whole new tuition policy reads as a shallow attempt by Folt’s administration to revamp the University’s reputation of privilege. There is still much work to be done in order to make a USC education accessible for a more diverse population. And this is definitely a step in some direction — the question is which one?

This semester has shown me the limitless possibilities that exist for wine adventures around the Los Angeles region. With a little bit of planning and access to a car — or at least a friend with a car — you can explore the selections that make Southern California a global wine hotspot. But first, a public service announcement: Don’t drink and drive, just don’t! 
Paso Robles
Known for its hot springs, olive oil, almonds and large variety of wineries, Paso Robles is the mecca for wine enthusiasts looking to have a well-rounded weekend getaway. The warm climate year-round is an enjoyable experience for us urbanites looking to be exposed to nature ⁠— actual nature, not Runyon Canyon. 
A winery that I recommend visiting is the Epoch Estate, a modernized winery that stands on historical grounds of the wine business in the region. Tastings are only $20 per person, a relatively affordable experience for the college winery-goer with some wineries, particularly those in Napa Valley, charging about $70 per person. Dogs are allowed in this winery, which is always a major plus for me, despite not owning one. Who wouldn’t want to pet a dog when wine tasting?
Don’t miss out on the hot springs and mud baths that this region is also known for! There’s something for everyone in your friend group to do in Paso Robles. 
Santa Barbara
A bit closer to home, Santa Barbara is the perfect location for those who want to take a day trip but not commit to the logistics of overnight excursions. Commonly referred to as the “American Riviera,” the city is known for its Mediterranean climate and casual oceanside lifestyle. 
For those hoping to experience all that Santa Barbara has to offer without having to trek to every winery in the vicinity, check out the Santa Barbara Wine Collective, a venue that offers wine tasting and retail sales and carries a wide selection of locally sourced wines. Plus, it’s way cheaper to order by the glass than to invest in a whole wine bottle. Great for friends with different wine taste!
Temecula
Heading south of Los Angeles, we arrive at a popular destination for Californian wine lovers — Temecula. Known for the Temecula Valley Balloon & Wine Festival in June and other thriving cultural experiences, this region is the best-kept secret of the West Coast wine world. And, dare I say, it’s much better than Napa Valley. (Shhh, please don’t tell my Northern Californian friends — don’t want my citizenship revoked!) 
The festival is an ideal weekend date for those staying in L.A. this summer. Featuring concerts with jazz and country artists and rainbow-colored hot air balloons, this is an experience that you do not want to miss out on. But you don’t have to wait until summer to explore the richness that is Temecula! Just drive down and start hitting up the wineries that have relatively affordable prices for tastings. I would highly recommend checking out family wineries such as the Thornton Winery and the Doffo Winery.
Having lived in Los Angeles for the past few years and with my academic career at USC coming to an end, I have realized how much I have taken for granted L.A. as the epicenter of the many wines of the world. We can order or hit up any wine bar or store in the city, all while becoming exposed to a global selection of wines. Although nothing can beat the experience of trying out wine in its local setting, it’s a misconception that we need to trek to France or even Napa Valley to taste the best wines. Extraordinary wines await us locally for those who are willing to seek them out.

For singer-songwriter Jaya Logani, music is personal, which explains why she is heavily involved in the conception of her records. The Indian American senior, who is majoring in music industry with a minor in songwriting, crafts the melodies and lyrics of all of her music.  
“I feel like if I wasn’t involved in making it, why should I be the one singing it?” Logani said. 
Logani began writing songs at 10 years old and knew even then it was more than just a hobby. The artist said that since both of her parents are doctors and in some Indian American families children are encouraged to pursue medical occupations, she was anxious about communicating her love for music. Despite this fear, her parents accepted her decision to make music long -term.
“I think they could tell growing up because I was always singing, and I credit my mom for the whole songwriting thing because she would remember the melody to all the songs on the radio but she always forgets the words,” Logani said. “So, growing up, it would become a challenge and we would change the words of songs to be about driving to the dentist or different things in life, which is where I got my love for making up stories.”
Logani’s music blends influences from both mainstream American and Bollywood music, representative of her American upbringing and Indian heritage. 
“I do pop and I tend to be more of a positive, optimistic person, so I feel like my target  [audience] is probably like young girls … and definitely trying to be more empowering,” Logani said. “I would love to reach more of the Asian community, too. Being Indian, I would love if I could reach Indian girls too and make them feel like, ‘Oh hey, I don’t only have to be a doctor with my life.’”
Nick Smiley, a senior majoring in music industry, is responsible for Logani’s visuals and her singles’ artwork. He also produced the lyric video for her latest single “Down Low,” which was released a day before Valentine’s Day. Smiley, who has known Logani for a few years, has witnessed her talent and dedication. 
“It’s been super cool to watch her evolve as an artist, as a songwriter, working with different producers to evolve her sound,” Smiley said. “One thing about Jaya is she really cares about her craft and she has a very good attention to detail. Whether it’s when we are shooting and going through photos or designing cover artwork, she cares a lot about the product and art she puts out.”
Smiley said he identifies with Logani’s music simply because of the personable way she expresses herself in her songs. 
“[Her music] really feels like who she is as a person,” Smiley said. “I think if you know Jaya in real life, she’s very full of life and energy and she sees the world in her own unique Jaya way. Her music definitely feels like it’s coming from her, and it has the same spunk and very creative and artistic sensitive quality to it as well.”
Logani’s musical confidence isn’t new — her music progressed when she began writing more seriously in high school and started working with her father-turned-manager and  also with Grammy-nominated producer Rick Jarrard, who is responsible for the famed Christmas anthem “Feliz Navidad.”
“I would record different songs that [Jarrard] had, and then I had to start proving myself and be like, ‘Hey, I can also write songs, I’ll give you one of mine,’” Logani said. “Then that progressed and my work with him ended up getting me into college for music.”
Logani’s record-making process is seemingly effortless and even random. She describes the concepts she works on as “golden lights,” with all other aspects, such as song-writing and choosing a melody, geared toward an initial inspiration. 
“You just kind of get an urge … this golden light out of nowhere or this golden cloud drops in front of your face and you don’t know what this idea is going to be, but you’re very compelled towards diving into it,” Logani said. 
 Despite the bursts of ecstatic energy that inspires her work, not all of her lyrical content is happy. Logani said her best ideas come from moments of uncertainty. 
“I feel like when the best stuff comes, I don’t necessarily have to be overwhelmingly happy, but when I’m just open, I feel like that’s when those really special ideas come that I don’t have to work for,” Logani said.
Jaya’s father and manager, Sanjay Logani, plays an integral role in helping her actualize her ideas. He is a witness to the progression she has made as an artist and remembers one of her early days as a songwriter when she wrote her first song “Paradise Island” on the steps of the treasury building in D.C.
“She wrote that song, and I took a video, and I thought, ‘Oh wow, that was really impressive.She’s just writing a song on the top of her head based on her experience here and the time she’s having,’” Sanjay said. 
Sanjay said he and his wife watched her grow into her own as an artist throughout middle school and helped guide her in the right direction when she finally vocalized the desire to pursue music as a career.
 The lyric video for Jaya’s upcoming single, “Down Low,” releases next week, bringing her a step closer to her big break, Sanjay said. 
“Her music has come from the first song, down to the wire to her last song, and she’s come a long way,” Sanjay said. “She is very close and right on the brink of breaking as an artist.”

The reality dating series follows a group of singles in Atlanta tasked with dating one another without ever meeting face-to-face. Until they decide whether or not to take the next step in their relationships and get engaged to a person they’ve never seen, the singles must get to know each other through deep conversations about love and life in an unusually fast-paced timeline. It’s not too late to start the show if you haven’t done so yet, as their reunion special is due to air March 5. 
“Self Made: Inspired by the Life of Madam C.J. Walker”

This new drama series, which follows the story of America’s first female millionaire and self-made African American entrepreneur and businesswoman, C.J. Walker, is coming to Netflix March 20. Octavia Spencer, known for her roles in “The Help,” “Hidden Figures” and “The Shape of Water,” takes the role of Sarah Breedlove, a woman who rises from poverty and builds an empire around hair care. The trailer reveals that the series will be inspiring and thought-provoking, and is bound to leave you eager to start watching.

Netflix’s original movies have proven to be successful hits among audiences and the buzz about this one has yet to die down. If you’re also a fan of Mark Wahlberg, Winston Duke or Post Malone, you should keep an eye out for this one.
“Blow the Man Down”

The film has been nominated for multiple awards at different festivals, including Best Screenplay in a U.S. Narrative Feature Film at the Tribeca Film Festival which it won.

The USC men’s baseball team won its second series of the season, winning two out of three games against Seton Hall. The Trojans are now 7-3 to start the year, scoring at least 10 runs in four of those wins.
Coming into the series against the Trojans, the Pirates were 3-3 and on a two-game losing streak, but they snapped their short skid with a 6-3 win against USC Friday. The game got off to an ugly start for USC in the first inning when Seton Hall scored 4 runs off junior pitcher Kyle Hurt. The Pirates got all 4 of their runs on just three singles, capitalizing on two walks and a hit by pitch.
A positive for the Trojans was sophomore first baseman Clay Owens’ second home run of the year in the sixth inning, a solo shot. Junior lefty Isaac Esqueda had a clean relief appearance, giving up only 1 run in 4.2 innings pitched.
USC would recover from its loss the next day with its first shutout of the year in a 3-0 win. Junior lefty John Beller had one of the best performances of his career with seven shutout innings, finishing with six strikeouts and lowering his season ERA to 1.13.
“We kinda just came into today with a gameplan of keeping the ball down, throwing strikes and letting our defense work, and that was kind of what we wanted to happen,” Beller said. “There were some amazing plays out there … that just helps me get the confidence right back.”
The Trojans finished with 3 runs on seven hits, two of which came from junior shortstop Ben Ramirez, who tallied two doubles and also scored a run.
On Sunday, USC had its third-largest win of the season in a 10-1 blowout. The Trojans scored in every inning but the third, fifth and eighth, finishing with 10 runs on 14 hits with no errors.
“Everything worked well,” head coach Jason Gill said. “It starts on the mound, right, when you can throw strikes and put up a lot of zeros … that gives your offense a little bit of confidence going out there every inning and not feeling like they have to play catch up.”
The Trojans put up 3-run innings in the second and sixth frames. Redshirt sophomore lefty Alex Cornwell had a solid performance with six innings pitched, surrendering only 1 earned run.
“[Cornwell was] getting ahead of hitters, [and] he’s still learning as well,” Gill said. “When he gets to finishing hitters off he’s going to be pretty dangerous.”
Freshman center fielder Rhylan Thomas picked up two knocks — including a triple — and one RBI. Junior third baseman Casey Dana led the Pirates in hits with two, including a home run, but it wasn’t near enough for Seton Hall. 
The Trojans have scored 76 runs in 10 games while giving up only 31. Gill hopes to continue USC’s momentum as the Trojans prepare to play their first Pac-12 opponent in less than two weeks.
USC will continue its 11-game homestand against UC Irvine Tuesday. The Anteaters are 5-6 on the season coming off a series loss at Washington. So far this season, junior outfielder Jake Palmer has been hitting over .400 for UCI with 8 RBIs. 
Gill had high praise for the Anteaters and knows it’ll be a tough test for his team.
“Obviously a very talented team, we had a chance to match up with them in the fall,” Gill said. “They took it to us a little bit, so I’ll be interested to see how our guys come out on Tuesday.”
The Trojans will play UC Irvine at Dedeaux Field Tuesday at 6 p.m.

For those who do not follow the NBA, San Antonio Spurs forward and USC basketball alumnus DeMar DeRozan is one of the best players in the league. He has received All-Star distinction in four of his 11 seasons thus far and is currently under contract with the Spurs for a hefty $27.7 million per season — one of the league’s largest annual salaries.
With all of his accolades, wealth and fame, it is not unusual to suspect that he must be one of the happiest men in the world. As arguably the most established Trojan in the NBA today, what could he have to complain or worry about?
As it turns out, it’s much more complicated than that. DeRozan’s openness about his struggles with mental health and depression can offer some perspective, especially considering the kinds of challenges the USC community has faced in recent months.
It turns out that the superficial possessions that some tend to associate with “success” do not always result in a sense of fulfillment. In fact, they may even lead to the opposite if people make their happiness contingent upon them, acquire them and then discover their superficial nature. This is made worse if, after making this discovery, people force themselves to convey to others a false sense of fulfillment in the hopes of finding it, rather than living in accordance with how they actually feel.
To DeRozan, the only positive solution to this crisis was to confront it critically, emerge with a positive outlook and share that message with others in the hopes that they win the battle too.
DeRozan spoke on this phenomenon in an interview with ESPN in March 2018.
“I know a lot of people are ashamed to talk about [their struggles with mental health],” DeRozan said. “Even myself for a long time … But you get to a certain age where you feel like it’s all about helping others. It’s not about you … Other people are going through stuff as well … and I just got to that point where it was finally time for me to say something.”
The beauty of hearing a statement like this from someone like DeRozan is that his words carry tremendous weight. He is a supremely talented and well-respected athlete who thousands — if not millions — of people see as a role model. In a world that can sometimes appear to be prone to juvenile, ego-driven impulsiveness, it is encouraging to see him use his influence in this way.
What’s especially inspiring is the obvious truth in his words: As he notes, this kind of truth is not always easy to come out and say. It takes courage to be open about emotional and mental health, knowing full well that some may judge or resent you for it.
In DeRozan’s case, however, his courage appears to be fueled by a sense of obligation to help others through the same sort of mental obstacles that he faced and eventually overcame. The effect of his words is nothing but good and he deserves to be praised for the courage he displayed.
The purpose of this week’s column is to give DeRozan the credit he deserves for his willingness to be open about the challenges he has faced in the past and to convey his message to the USC community at large. After the tragic events which have taken place within our community recently, DeRozan can hopefully serve as a North Star to people who may be experiencing some of the same struggles that he once did.

The No. 1 USC women’s water polo team continued its 4-0 winning streak on the road with a 15-11 win over No. 13 San Jose State Sunday. 
The Trojans had been looking to extend their 37-0 series record over the Spartans in their first MPSF match of the season. Both teams returned from the Barbara Kalbus Invitational at UC Irvine, where SJSU finished in 12th place and USC took the title.
SJSU senior 2-meter Jacqui Maisey scored as a result of a USC turnover, but Trojan junior driver Verica Bakoc answered on the next drive to start the Trojans’ 6-goal campaign in the first. Senior driver Elise Stein added another on a powerplay and senior driver Denise Mammolito scored on even strength with an assist from sophomore driver Grace Tehaney.
SJSU added a goal from junior 2-meter Tyanna Supreme to end USC’s scoring run in the period, but senior 2-meter Kaylee Brownsberger, Bakoc and sophomore 2-meter Mireia Guiral added to the Trojans’ lead within the last minute and a half. 
A double turnover began the second frame, allowing SJSU’s sophomore utility Olga Descalzi Portell to score just a minute in. After working the ball around on a powerplay, Tehaney was able to score to bring the game to 7-3. Despite Brownsberger’s hat trick and Bakoc’s second goal, however, the Spartans took advantage of man-down and even-strength plays to end the half at 10-5. 
SJSU struggled with a low shooting percentage in the first half, but in the past, USC has allowed more goals in the second. With this in mind, the plays that made the game for USC involved ball movement and patience to find the best shot for six-on-fives. 
Sophomore utility Bayley Weber scored a goal on a steal to begin her own run toward a hat trick, and another shot from Guiral brought the score to 12-6 after the Spartans’ Maisey snuck one in on the first drive. While SJSU took another goal on a powerplay, redshirt junior goalie Holly Parker made sure the run ended there, blocking a 5-meter penalty shot to keep a sizable lead heading into the fourth.
From Parker’s position in goal, USC’s defense was best at taking a hard press and forcing turnovers — eight in total by the end of the game.
“I think the defense has been pretty solid all around,” Parker said. “I think we struggled a little bit today, but we have a pretty strong press and press defense and I think that that was able to force a lot of the turnovers. With that said, we did give up a few too many shots more than we had set the goal for, but we won the game. A win’s a win.”
The Trojans looked to maintain their late lead with redshirt freshman Erin Tharp in goal. SJSU was able to get three goals in — two on powerplays — but Weber put back-to-back scores past sophomore goalie Hannah Henry in response. The Spartans’ six-on-five percentage was rounded out at .417 with another goal from Supreme, but USC sophomore utility Sophia Lucas was there to answer to bring the final score to 15-11. 
While the win carried USC’s momentum from the past invitational title, Parker noted that it was also an opportunity to scout an MPSF opponent come tourney time. 
“[The win] was really nice to get the feel of just being up there, seeing them, getting a preview to what they might do moving forward,” Parker said. “And if we play them again in conference, we’ll be even better prepared for them.”
After a break the upcoming weekend, the Trojans will face No. 7 Cal at home March 14 at noon before a quick turnaround to host Indiana March 15 at noon.

The USC women’s basketball team closed out its regular season against Colorado Sunday afternoon in a 66-55 win at Galen Center. The Trojans’ encouraging development over the course of the season as well as the team’s strong finish should give them momentum heading into the Pac-12 Tournament this week in Las Vegas.
After narrowly defeating Utah 69-66 Friday evening, the Trojans took care of business on Senior Day against the Buffaloes to finish the regular season on a three-game winning streak. 
Sunday’s game marked the first time USC held an opponent to under 60 points in conference play this year and the lowest total it has held an opponent to since a win against Cal State Long Beach Dec. 21.
The Trojans earned a split in the season series with the Buffaloes after getting outscored 27-10 in the third quarter of what would ultimately become a 66-53 loss in the teams’ first meeting in Boulder. 
Second-half efforts were not a concern for head coach Mark Trakh and company on Sunday, however, as USC maintained its first-half lead throughout the final two quarters.
Graduate guards Aliyah Jeune and Stephanie Watts were held out with injuries, but senior forward Kayla Overbeck made her presence known on both ends of the floor as she provided energy for the Trojans throughout the afternoon. Overbeck finished her final game at Galen Center with 10 points, four rebounds and a win.
Trakh was complimentary of Overbeck as a player and young leader during her final season at USC.
“She was not going to let her team lose,” Trakh said. “She’s one of our most valuable players out there … She anchors the defense.”
A strong first half for the Trojans saw them open up a 12-point lead at the half after outscoring the Buffs 18-6 in the second quarter. Colorado shot a paltry 20% from the field in the first two quarters compared to a mark of 42.3% for USC.
USC was led by another impressive showing from freshmen forward Alissa Pili — who earned her fourth Pac-12 Freshman of the Week award Monday — and guard Endyia Rogers. Rogers continued her recent strong run for USC, finishing with 20 points to go with four rebounds and four assists.
After averaging 30.5 points in her last two games, Pili topped her season average of 16.1 once again, finishing with 20 points to go with 13 rebounds. Pili’s efforts amounted to her 11th double-double this season — a team-high — and her 14th straight game with at least 10 points.
The Trojans’ stout defensive effort limited Colorado’s ability to shoot the ball from deep, as the Buffaloes missed all 12 of their attempts from behind the arc while USC sank four threes. 
Overbeck was proud of the team’s defensive effort to shut down Colorado’s offense throughout the game.
“We were just trying to have urgency coming at the 3-point shooters,” Overbeck said. “Make them be drivers, make them take tough shots. We really excelled at it today.”
USC ended the regular season on a high note, winning eight of its final 13 conference games after losing its first five games of Pac-12 play.
The win puts the Trojans at 16-13 overall on the season, including an 8-10 mark in conference play and an 11-4 overall record at home — good for seventh in a strong Pac-12 conference. 
Trakh seemed encouraged by his team’s growth over the course of the season, especially given the Trojans’ tough start to conference play. 
“We’re playing good basketball right now,” Trakh said. “I think it’s selflessness, I think it’s teamwork, I think it’s attitude, it’s culture. I’m just really proud of the kids.”
The Trojans will return to action with plenty of momentum March 5 in Las Vegas for a rematch with Colorado in the first round of the Pac-12 Tournament Thursday at 6 p.m.
