To be Raj, or to be Rahul, that is the question. 
Thirty years ago, Bollywood crowned a king who was never once a prince. Shah Rukh Khan, an Indian actor, marked his arrival into the machinery of the Bollywood industry with his debut in “Raj Kanwar’s Deewana” (1992), sweeping the nation with his portrayal of Raja Sahai. An overnight success, his celebrity and stardom took flight and in its shadows, he stole the heart of the country. With arms extended in his signature pose, Shah Rukh Khan is now a household name that lingers on every tongue. As he celebrates 30 years in the industry, he continues to be celebrated for his craft, soon to be honored at Saudi Arabia’s Red Sea International Film Festival. 
Be it his brilliance in “My Name is Khan” (2010) or a mere cameo in “Brahmastra” (2022), his films will always bring me home. So if you are in need of a home or simply looking for a place to rest for the night, read on. Some trivial and rather underwhelming plotlines might lose you, but SRK’s acting — as is customary — will always win you over. After all, “haar kar jeetne wale ko baazigar kehte hai” — the one who wins by losing is a true gambler. 
“Devdas” (2002)
For me, when life closes one door, another opens — more often than not, one that leads into a darkening theater screening a classic Bollywood movie that is sufficient to create a dent in my already crumbling emotional stability. Based on the novel by Sarat Chandra Chattopadhyay, “Devdas” is a five-time award-winning contender in this category. A poster child of dramatization, it is consumed by an exaggeration and opulence that both defines yet somehow manages to outdo the typical Bollywood flair. As such, “Devdas” was director Sanjay Leela Bhansali’s foremost attempt at depicting the splendor and grandiose appeal of Indian high society. 
Within this operatic world that has been painstakingly crafted, we encounter Devdas (Shah Rukh Khan), the prodigal son of the Mukherjee family, who is — to put it gently — an alcoholic wrecking ball. Within every frame (a majority of which he spends alternating between crying and drinking), Khan settles into the skin of Devdas with the same ease and magnificence as that of the sun that melts over the lens of the film. The mastery with which he filters through expressions, an idiosyncrasy unseen in his earlier performances, is brilliant, to say the least. He finds himself in an overture of heartbreaking silence, instantaneously pierced with raging violence, soon to melt into a clear-eyed plea for forgiveness. His wandering eyes, trembling vocalization and sneering laughter lend an unforgettable humanness to the character. 
This, however, is not to say that Devdas isn’t shy of its indignities and frailties. It is replete with values of trickle-down patriarchy, male chauvinism and the romanticization of alcoholism. Yet, within the extremities of his on-screen presence, Khan is a slow-burning sensation. To put it simply, Devdas is an agent of his own ruin but the groundwork of his fame. 
“Kal Ho Naa Ho” (2003)
To watch “Kal Ho Naa Ho” is to dive head first into three hours and six minutes of pure Bollywood indulgence. 
At its core, it is a melodramatic tale of the Kapurs, an eccentrically dysfunctional family that is perennially on edge, owing to the endless quarrels that govern their household. Seconds into the film, we bear witness to their severed family dynamic, catching wisps of them wishing upon a star for a farishta or angel to bring them their happily-ever-after ending. 
Enter Aman (Shah Rukh Khan): the charming and large-hearted yet over-indulgent, nosy neighbor who utters words of wisdom that have, for decades now, been rote-learned and often roll off the tongue of every Bollywood fanatic. While clouds of highly problematic body shaming, misogyny and objectification shadow the film, SRK’s over-the-top, beamingly animated and ironically full-of-life persona kindles forgiveness. 
A story of love that is wrapped in a welter of loss, “Kal Ho Naa Ho” is a warm hug that always hits too close to home.  Reveling in the aura of SRK’s celebrity, the politics of division that have often permeated Hindi cinema take a back seat and allow joy to be the driving force. Through the eyes of director Nikhil Advani and screenwriter Karan Johar, we witness a paragon of culture liberated in a modern world, painting a canvas that is so vibrant and visceral that Indian society seemingly thrives in the Kapurs’ little corner of New York City. 
No matter the years that pass, “Kal Ho Naa Ho” — for all its glory — shall always remain a classic, with Shah Rukh Khan’s words eternally echoing, “Haso, jiyo, muskurao, kya pata kal ho naa ho” — Laugh, live, smile. Tomorrow is never guaranteed.
“Chak De! India” (2007)
Shimit Amin’s fictionalized biography “Chak De! India” is a film that foremost exemplifies grit, picks at the yarn of passion and retreats from the trenches of failure. Contrary to an otherwise idyllic and familiar portrayal of the underdogs finding themselves victorious at the penultimate moment, “Chak De” is a fever dream that crawls into our hearts by degrees. 
In the role of a lifetime, we come upon Shah Rukh Khan in the shadows of a dingy home with unmoored eyes and a fractured spirit. As such, he sinks his teeth into his portrayal of Coach Kabir Khan with immense precision, imbuing the film with a sense of long-lost determination and a blind yet passive rage that wells in his mannerisms. Chartering a course for Shah Rukh that steers not too far from reality, screenwriter Jaideep Sahni blends fictionality with the truth, borrowing tribulations from the life of Mir Ranjan Negi to fit his rendition of Coach Kabir Khan. 
However, as we bury ourselves further into his life, we bear witness to an afterglow of hope. Weaving a tale of self-exploration, success and redemption, “Chak De” roots us with its intensity and verve but provides wings for us to take flight. Khan chaperones a sweeping desire to actualize the dreams that take refuge in our most unfettered imaginations. Delicately yet marvelously, it sways us to peer into the glass mirror, reflecting on a journey of healing that stays with us long after the credits roll.

It’s application season already, and as I contemplate what institution I hope to sell my soul to (with only three months of proposed security), I can’t help but reflect. I already have a bad habit of thinking about the past too often, but I’m trying to approach it more graciously.
The GRAMMY nominations were announced Nov. 15, and it’s made me think a lot about acknowledgments and their power and precedence. They are my favorite part of every book I read and though the awards given off-screen tend to be diminished, I want to honor the sentiment. 
My time at this institution is also wrapping up pretty soon, and it is safe to say that a lot of bad shit has happened over these past three and a half years. 
There was the coronavirus pandemic where, for some reason, I was in school full-time and worked close to 20 hours a week while mask mandates and social distancing were still in place. If you read my second installation of this column, you know about that one night, but it didn’t really hit until I began seeing him on campus again once we returned. This has recently resulted in a post-traumatic stress disorder diagnosis along with three others. 
To sum a lot of it up, I have a hard time trusting and an even harder time feeling gratitude at times, especially in relation to this institution.
But there are a few things and more than a few people that allow me to see college in the right light. 
My wonderful housemates who have withstood the test of being my friend and have warmly taught me about queer love along with the incredibly bright students who inspire creation — they tether me to this world when I float away.
The music industry program in the Thornton School of Music, coupled with the ranging talent that is discovered in Los Angeles supported by (what I consider to be notorious) good weather makes University Park a breeding ground for innovation in music. I’ve had the privilege of speaking to a lot of these up-and-coming key players. I may not know a lot about what’s to come in the years post-graduation, but I do know I am ready to continue to witness them all. I trust that. 
For the dudes at 29th Street who trusted me with their story when I was starting out, to the homie Shawn from the Bay Area who started Cup of Troy, to Amanda and Shea who put on the women in jazz Bebop ‘n’ Blues show earlier this year — which was my favorite student production I’ve been too — and so many more, I am eternally grateful. 
Kicking around gravel in the backyards of these historically preserved houses around campus listening to live music, with the California sunset as the backdrop, is something I am confident to be unparalleled anywhere else. It’s hard to recognize the intricate beauty of something when you’re up close and personal with it. But these are the memories I’m already clinging on to. 
Los Angeles is home to over 400 concert venues, and I have maybe gone to only two hands worth, but the moments are innumerable. Taking molly while seeing KAYTRANADA on Halloween at the Shrine and going to the Hollywood Bowl for the first time to see an artist I don’t even listen to are some of the fondest. 
I’ve never felt tied to this campus. Most of the time, I feel like I am not supposed to be here. But I have to give credit where it’s due, and I suppose this University has (though I still maintain only tangentially) fostered environments where I have become self-assured. 
It was also during my time at USC that I started therapy — for a multitude of reasons — and started using drugs for something more important than recreation. 
SSRIs are, to my frustration, spoken about in more hushed tones than the tales of drunk nights and promiscuous sex. More so than coming into my sexuality or trying to figure out why I’m so scared of commitment, my process of getting accurate diagnoses has been one of the most difficult things for me to figure out and definitely the most intimate. 
I’m not great at doing things without some guidance and guard rails and I’m trying to get more comfortable with looking at myself in the mirror, but I will always choose my hearing over my sight. 
I’ve thought a lot about the ironic and unfortunate dichotomy of focusing on myself and my mental health while gearing up to enter the world as a practicing journalist. 
They tell you in j-school that journalists should be mere, objective and unobstructive. We learn not only how to do our profession, but to be our profession. We abandon our personal identities for the sake of a story — and there’s always a story. 
Finding yourself takes serious time — way more time than a journalist is allowed — and it doesn’t help when mental health professionals themselves try to rush the process all the more. “wondering/wandering” by Kehlani in particular has kept me at ease in the meantime. 
Anxiety and depression disorders are highly identifiable, more commonly diagnosed by psychiatrists and are the most frequently discussed and understood throughout mental health discourse. 
Because these disorders are proximal to feelings of nervousness and sadness, they are understood within an able-bodied understanding of existence. But once a diagnosis becomes non-normative, the more ostracized a person can feel despite the plentiful emails about mental health support and “wellness” directors we’re supposed to believe in. 
That’s where the music saves us. 
With a personality disorder, maybe I’m the most equipped to throw myself into a world where it’s all for the sake of other people. It is this exact sentiment that I am trying so desperately to avoid, though. 
My relationships with others, to whatever degree those are maintained and practiced, are what help me come into my relationship with myself. But when those relationships are forged for the sake of a word count or headline, I become lost. 
The backyards I’ve found myself in are my guardrails. As are the hangovers, as are the simultaneous orgasms, as is this column. I’ve found that I’m actually the best journalist I can be when I throw myself into it all. 
My shaky sense of self is more volatile than the stock market and oftentimes misrepresents me worse than Billboard charts, but with the help of others and my guardrails, I do trust I will figure out who I am. 
In honor of Thanksgiving coming up and this being my last column of the semester, I want to thank you for reading. I hope I can squeeze in acknowledgements in all of the work I will do. It deserves it. You all deserve it.

German couple Baran bo Odar and Jantje Friese have done it again. On Nov. 17, “1899,” the duo’s long-awaited follow-up to their critically acclaimed first series, “Dark,” released on Netflix. Coming two years after the final season of “Dark,” bo Odar and Friese made sure “1899” was well worth the wait. 
“1899” follows a boat of people from many different countries traveling from London to New York City in 1899. As such, much of the show is not in English, with eight languages spoken regularly throughout the first season’s eight episodes. While it was really interesting to hear so many different languages and see people from all over the world find ways to communicate with one another, there is very little handholding. It’s up to the viewer to figure out which characters speak what languages and to keep track of all these characters’ stories as they progress rapidly. “1899” focuses on a whopping 20 characters, and we are dumped right into the deep end of it all without any assistance. 
One way “1899” really shines is through its amazing cast filled with unknown actors. Without the baggage many recognizable actors carry, “1899” allows the plot to truly shine. While all the characters are interesting in some way, the most compelling character is by far the one we spend the most time with: Maura Franklin, played by Emily Beecham. She acts as the viewer’s proxy with her story helping to throw the curtain open on what is truly going on with the ship. Beecham does a tremendous job playing Maura Franklin, creating a wholly sympathetic character at the start of the season whose motivations become more and more questionable as the season progresses.
Another stand-out element of the first season are the effects, both practical and visual. A very important part of how “Dark” was successful was that despite its lofty hard sci-fi and time travel concepts, a lot of the machinery was practical and resulted in a tactile feel that would not have come through with just visual effects. The same is true for “1899.” While there are definitely visual effects used — they filmed a lot of the show using a set where the actors can see what is being projected onto the background all around them — it is the more grounded effects that will truly astonish viewers. The machine at the bottom of the ship and the remotes that control it invoke a sense of wonder that would be impossible with only CGI. 
In addition to the superb casting and effects, the production design and costumes also help immerse audiences into the unique environment of “1899.” The ship looks like any late 19th century cruiseliner but contains elements that hint at a greater plot unfolding right beneath your nose. The cabin designs are particularly effective with each passenger’s cabin easily recognizable while maintaining the innocuousness of a cruise cabin. The variety of costumes highlights the vast diversity of cultures that are present on the ship, with Ling Yi — a Chinese woman pretending to be Japanese — donning a beautiful kimono for most of the season.
Everyone should give “1899” a try, even those who are not the biggest sci-fi fans, because of how high-quality every element of the series is and how it exceeds preconceived notions about the genre. The only real negative is that we will have to wait at least a year for the next season.

Like most children of immigrants, I always felt like a weird mash-up of two cultures. My childhood consisted of traditional Gujarati dinners on weekdays and Pizza Hut on weekends, Bollywood movies with my parents and Disney Channel TV shows with my friends.
Growing up, one of my favorite meals was paneer pasta, a dish that pays homage to my duality. It comes together by pan frying bite-sized cubes of paneer — an Indian cottage cheese — and tossing the paneer pieces with spaghetti, marinara sauce and stir-fried vegetables. To this day, paneer pasta feels like the perfect representation of who I am — an amalgamation of my Indian heritage and American upbringing.
These types of fusion dishes were all the rage in the ‘80s when chefs like Wolfgang Puck and Roy Yamaguchi experimented with combinations of different cuisines. While fusion food was originally celebrated by the cooking community, by the ‘90s, food writers and critics claimed that fusion food was more “con-fusion” than anything.
Paneer pasta is the reason I’ve never understood the culinary disdain for fusion food. Food’s beauty lies in its ability to transcend borders and cultural barriers, bringing together communities over a shared love of flavorful eats. Fusion food is the ultimate expression of that.
Long before fusion food became an ‘80s buzzword, it was a way of life. As people began moving from one place to another, they brought their favorite foods with them and shared those recipes with their new neighbors.
In the late 1800s, many Chinese immigrants came to South America and began cooking the dishes they love with Peruvian ingredients. This mix of Chinese flavors and Peruvian ingredients is now known as Chifa cuisine. From lomo saltado to chaufa, several mainstays of Peruvian food are inspired by this cultural collision.
Though much of the food we love — from queso to bahn mi sandwiches — are fusion foods, fusion went out of style as chefs stopped respecting the cultures they were borrowing from.
Rather than pairing ingredients and techniques that complimented one another, chefs began combining the most shocking foods. ‘90s chefs forgot that fusion was about marrying cultures and tried instead to create the most unexpected, and often undesirable, flavor combinations.
Fusion food becomes appropriative when chefs take ideas from other cuisines without learning to respect the cultures those flavors come from. Delicious fusion food requires chefs to understand the ingredients and techniques they’re incorporating into their dishes.
There’s a delicate balance between honoring culture and tradition and blending the flavors and cooking techniques of different cuisines. When fusion food loses the spirit of its parent cultures, it crosses from appreciation to appropriation.
We usually think of fusion food in the context of trained chefs developing restaurant recipes, but the best fusion foods are often the ones we make at home, combining the flavors of our childhood with those we’ve learned from our friends and neighbors.
Adding fusion elements in our home cooking is the solution to nearly every dilemma. Though the traditional American Thanksgiving dinner is stuffed with delicious starches, meats and herbs, it has little to no textural diversity.
Samin Nosrat, a well-known chef, food writer and TV personality, explains the key to an irresistible Thanksgiving dinner is turning to different communities. In her article “How To Make Your Thanksgiving Dinner Less Boring,” Samin describes a Cambodian method of frying shallots to obtain the perfect crispy, golden-brown texture.
In her endeavor to add crunch to Thanksgiving, Samin uses this Cambodian technique to create a beautifully fried topping with breadcrumbs, rosemary, sage, thyme and parsley — overflowing with the flavor of Thanksgiving while paying respects to Cambodian traditions.
Food is sacred in its ability to bridge cultural and ideological divides. This Thanksgiving topping is a simple example of the ways food can unite us. By integrating fusion cooking into our daily lives, we have an opportunity to learn about the cultures we’re surrounded by and appreciate their flavors through our own cooking.
Sharing our culture is the ultimate form of connection, an act full of love, laughter and nourishment. When made respectfully, fusion food represents diverse communities coming together to create something filled with that same emotional and physical sustenance.

I don’t know anyone who likes job interviews. They’re stressful and uncomfortable, and the preparation is time-consuming. I’d always accepted them as a necessary evil, but are they? In an age where society is reexamining traditions that once seemed immutable, why don’t we do the same for job interviews?
The typical job interview structure attempts to determine competency and compatibility in under an hour. That’s no easy feat. But a traditional interview might not be the quick, reliable solution we think it is.
I’ve often been told to “sell myself” in an interview. Wear your nicest clothes, put on makeup (but not too much), smile often, sit up straight, make eye contact, exude confidence. These tips stem from the unfortunate fact that interviewers take appearance and nonverbal cues into serious consideration. 
“We automatically jump to all kinds of erroneous assumptions about a candidate from their appearance,” psychologist Ron Friedman said in an interview with the World Economic Forum. The way we determine competency in an interview is inherently flawed because we ignore the unconscious biases and assumptions of the interviewer.
“Studies show we view good looking people as more competent. We perceive tall candidates as having greater leadership potential. And we assume deep-voiced candidates are more trustworthy,” Friedman said. How we present ourselves outwardly is paramount in the current interview process, to the detriment of both the company, who could be unintentionally turning away the best hires, and the candidates, because their talents are overshadowed by their social competency. 
In-person interviews impose financial restrictions, too. Some job candidates cannot pay the travel expenses to commute to an interview location or afford expensive interview attire. The next Steve Jobs might not be able to wear that nice suit and tie an interviewer is looking for, yet judging one’s potential on their appearance is often step one in the in-person interview process.
In certain fields, like sales, the one-on-one in-person interview strategy makes more sense. But what about all the occupations that require little to no customer interaction? Confidence in social situations should not be the universal determining factor. Talent and experience should have the most weight in decision-making.
Adding onto the list of why job interviews are currently a terrible measure of one’s potential, the usual interview process discriminates against people with certain conditions, such as autism or social anxiety. Neurodiverse candidates might be overlooked for something inconsequential and completely outside of their control, such as not making eye contact with the interviewer.
According to the London School of Economics and Political Science writers Daniela Lup and Esther Canónico, “Ample research has demonstrated that applicants’ interpersonal attributes (e.g. warmth, confidence, flexibility) inferred during open interactions are highly correlated with the interviewers’ overall positive evaluation of a candidate. This raises the question how warm, confident or flexible are autistic individuals perceived.”
Both neurodivergent and neurotypical candidates have their weaknesses and flaws, but the current interview process disadvantages those with mental illnesses, neurological disorders and disabilities by having their supposed “flaws” judged more negatively. 
While companies all have their own methods of interviewing candidates, the question and answer model continues to dominate the hiring process. As Forbes writer Lisa Whealon states, “Traditional interviews do not give you a clear picture of success and will only set you up for failure. To know if someone will be a fit for the role and the company, you must disrupt your recruiting process and implement non-traditional ways to encourage authenticity.”
I don’t have the perfect alternative to the typical job interview, and I don’t think there should be just one, either. The main problem is the one-size-fits-all approach of the current interview structure. Interviews today prize confidence and charisma no matter the role, and that’s a problem. Interviews should be tailored to the role the company is hiring for.
For example, if hiring for a writing job, ask for writing samples or give a writing assessment. If it’s a web design position, ask them to create a landing page. An assessment or audition is job-specific, easier to operationalize and doesn’t automatically discriminate against applicants. An interview restructuring is sorely needed, because as of right now, the best interviewee is not necessarily the best employee.

Thanksgiving break is practically here. The weather is getting chillier; many are packing their bags and leaving campus to go back home to their friends and family. Burnout has hit us all like a truck. We’re all ready to get stuffed with our family’s best Thanksgiving treats and go into hibernation. But maybe you’re one of the many Trojans not going home this Thanksgiving. If so, here’s a reminder that it’s totally fine to do so! 
First of all, if you choose not to go back home, just know that your choice is 100% valid. You don’t need to feel pressured to go back — it shouldn’t be an obligation, because that defeats the whole meaning of the holiday season. It’s okay to prioritize your mental and physical health, and if going home causes you stress, then be firm in your decisions because only you know your needs. Remember, you can choose your family and home. So if you want to skip out on the Thanksgiving drama, don’t have the funds to fly home or feel like your family is actually here on campus, do whatever feels right to you and keeps you feeling your best.
The Guardian writer Christina Wyman expresses this sentiment perfectly by saying, “The expectation that families should spend the holidays together at all costs is built into the fabric of American culture. You’ll notice this in the many holiday season advertisements that fetishize the idea of a loving nuclear family rather than provide images of friends gathering in mixed groups.”
Thanksgiving does not have to include a family gathering if you don’t want that. Not going back home is not a bad thing, and American societal norms should not pressure you to conform to its standards. In fact, not going home can prevent potential conflicts that come with Thanksgiving dinner and may be better for everyone’s relationships.
While this holiday is usually celebrated with friends and family, Thanksgiving is what you make of it. You can reflect on all the wonderful things in your life in any way you want. One way is Friendsgiving. Have a nice potluck with your friends and eat good food. (After all, there’s only so much USC dining hall food you can eat.) Chill and stay home, watch a movie, eat. Do some skincare and look after yourself. You don’t have to do anything for Thanksgiving if you don’t want to. Just remember to relax and take a break because you deserve it. Finals are right around the corner too, so taking this time for yourself is a necessity at this point.
Being alone during this time can get a bit lonely, but as Refinery29 writer Elly Belle stated, “This year does not have to be an empty, misshapen place or a hole to fill. It can be the year you find and perfect a recipe you really love, or order takeout from a new place and treat yourself to a favorite meal you almost never eat, instead of making a complicated meal. You can pause and reflect.”
One classic and great way to reflect and destress is to write. Maybe you do not have to write an entire article like this, but just write to reflect your stream of consciousness. Write in your diary or write some letters to your loved ones and mail them in place of you coming home for the holiday season. No matter what the circumstances are, the person who receives your letter will definitely appreciate such a heartfelt gesture. 
If you’re not going home for Thanksgiving, that’s okay. Just remember, this day is like any other, so have fun because there’s so much to celebrate — you got through the majority of the semester, and you should be proud of that! You have the rest of the week off, so sleep in and de-stress because you deserve it. The holiday season doesn’t have to be lonely, even if you’re taking some time to yourself to recover from the burnout. There’s more to Thanksgiving than just going home, so take care of yourself.

Among the crinkle of Subway sandwich wrappers, cross-town rivals chatted in anticipation for the first UCLA x USC Integral Bee the Sunday after the Trojans’ victory against the Bruins at Rose Bowl Stadium the day before. 
Competitors and spectators filled the seats of Stauffer Science Lecture Hall, excited to participate in the friendly head-to-head elimination bracket tournament hosted by the UCLA x USC Math Club. Last semester, the USC Math Club hosted the first ever integral bee for USC students at the University. This semester, the Bruins came out on top, winning the top three places in the competition.
“The reason we picked integrals is because that’s one of the first things that people learn in college math,” said Ajay Srinivasan, a sophomore majoring in mathematics and one of the event’s organizers. “It’s also a very easy example of how problem solving should be approached several times. It’s sort of the first window into problem solving for a lot of people and it was for me, too. It’s accessible. It’s fun.”
After a quick overview of rules and tips and a shout-out to USC Football’s win, the competition began. In the first two rounds, two random pairs of participants were called to the boards at the front of the hall. Each round began with a countdown to “go,” when participants began to examine the integral projected onto the screens above them.
Some competitors furiously etched their ideas on the board as they worked out the question while others wrote out the question or parts of the question before contemplating the problem closer. U-subs and trigonometric functions also appeared on the board.
June Shao, a sophomore majoring in electrical and computer engineering, competed in the event. 
“The first time you get a question, you start panicking, and then you just take a few seconds to actually look at their problem and try to destress and calm yourself down and that helps because you can see ‘oh, this is really obvious’ or ‘oh, I can see this trick,’” Shao said. “If it’s really complicated, you may not see it at first.” 
Contestants had less than a minute to solve each question. A quick solution, if not entirely correct, could result in a strike. After two strikes, the competitor was eliminated.
As competitors worked through the problems, their sketches and furious chalk-writing on the board kept audience members captivated by the math. Some audience members worked through the questions on paper in their seats, alongside the competition. In one question that stumped competitors, three out of four got it wrong the first try. 
Throughout the competition period, Srinivasan, the moderator, shared hints for the question if competitors looked lost like “a polar bear in an Erewhon,” as written on the Integral Bee’s introduction slides. 
If a competing pair could not solve the given question, they continued to the next round with a new question. If the question remained unsolvable, both members of the pair lost the round. Contrarily, the quickest round lasted nearly five seconds.
“I didn’t know how to solve most of the problems, but I like to people-watch,” said Abraham Solovy, a senior majoring in political economy and an attendee. “I know a lot of the people in the club so I thought that I could come support.”
In a surprise integral, competitors were faced with a word problem filled with emojis and colloquialisms. Audience members erupted in laughter and competitors stepped away from the projection of the problem with puzzled faces and questioning looks. After a few seconds, the event coordinators relieved competitors of their misery and revealed the math integration of the word question, and the competitors quickly got back to the boards to solve it. 
As soon as competitors circled or boxed their answers, Scott Macdonald, an assistant professor of physics and astronomy, reviewed their responses. Some competitors were stumped by trickier questions, while others were aggravated by missed positive and negative numbers after their work was checked.
“We were excited with how things went, it was a good vibe,” said Angel Hernandez, a senior majoring in business and an organizer of the bee. “Everyone seemed to have a friendly competition. Especially when we got to the harder integrals, everyone got excited.” 
Whenever Srinivasan asked the competitors if they wanted the same level of difficulty or harder questions for the following round, the crowd would respond with a resounding response for more difficult integrals.
“[I loved] getting a question right, but also seeing how people were cheering each other on, even those not from their school,” Shao said. 
In good spirit, audience members clapped as competitors made their way to the board and solved problems.  
“I was surprised by the passion it creates,” Solovy said. “I’ve never been to a USC event with so much passion, which is wild.”
Hernandez said Srinivasan began the first Integral Bee last year with the goal of “testing out” math skills. 
“For a lot of people, math is really fun, so having the space to solve integrals with an audience is not something you see every day,” Hernandez said. “It’s something we wanted to bring to the table.” 
In the future, the math club hopes to “integrate” more schools into the Integral Bee such as Caltech, Loyola Marymount University and other nearby colleges.
“It was an enjoyable experience,” Shao said. “It was quite fun to see everyone congregate over a love of integrals — a love of solving problems.”

Extended hours, an updated frequently asked questions section, contact information for faculty members and a new Chatbot aim to make research less difficult for students, especially those with tight schedules. 
Email and the Chatbot will be available 24 hours a day, while Live Chat with staff members and librarians will be available from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. on Mondays through Thursdays, and noon to 4 p.m. on Fridays. 
Melissa Miller, the head of the Hoose Library of Philosophy, is part of the team working on this project. She hopes that it will make students more aware that USC employees are available as resources. 
“The main goal is to try to provide more access to strategic research collaborations for students, faculty and staff,” Miller said. 
USC community members can schedule appointments for one-on-one research consultations and other forms of assistance with subject librarians, whose contact information is available through research guides on the library’s website. Meetings can take place through Zoom, phone call or email. 
Many faculty librarians at USC also teach courses at the University and are knowledgeable in a variety of subject areas. They also have field experience and expertise surrounding the academic research process, which they are willing to share with students.
“We’re happy to teach research skills like finding, evaluating and critically analyzing resources and such for research papers or projects, and are happy to be partners in that process,” Miller said. 
Some of these resources, such as emails and FAQs, have been available in the library system for a while. They’ve now been updated from previous versions in an attempt to increase use. Miller said the chief objective of this effort is to update and increase accessibility to these tools. 
“We really want to stress that the virtual reference pilot program is increasing availability because you don’t just have to do it in person,” Miller said. 
Isabel Chavero, a sophomore majoring in political science, said she will use these new tools for her research. It can be relatively easy, she said, to look for information on specific topics through the libraries’ research databases, but it can also be overwhelming due to the vast amount of information there is to navigate. 
Chavero said she believes the new tools, such as Live Chat, will help in encouraging students to use what the library has to offer. 
“I think a lot of students don’t even know that they’re able to do pretty profound research with the content that USC Libraries has,” Chavero said. 
Christophe Merriam, a freshman majoring in business of cinematic arts, tried out some of the new research tools for one of his classes. He attended workshops in Leavey Library led by instructors who conducted their own research while also working at the library. He used the library to gather information and review sources for a final project about labor exploitation in Bangladesh. He said the workshops were quite helpful, as many of his professors require research for coursework but provide limited guidance on how to obtain it. 
Merriam said he didn’t know that the libraries offered these tools and had previously just used Google to find needed information. 
“[The instructors] told us what all the online resources were and, to be honest, I didn’t know any of them at all before,” Merriam said. 
Merriam said the one thing that he wished was different during his research processes was more time slot availability. Most slots he saw were mid-day, which is when he has the bulk of his classes. Merriam said he believes the 24-hour Chatbot will be helpful for issues like this. 
“If it was late at night and I was struggling to do research or I had a deadline coming up, I could see that being very valuable,” Merriam said. 
The team of librarians working on this project plans to continue improving the library’s research aids based on analysis of how the current tools work. Right now, the main focus is increasing virtual access to these aids, Miller said. 
The new tools can be accessed by visiting the online USC Libraries page. From here, the “Connect with the Libraries” page can direct users to Live Chat, ChatBot, an email form and contact information for subject librarians to help with research in specific fields.

USC’s medical facilities — Keck Medical Center of USC and its various hospitals and USC Student Health, a branch of Keck Medicine of USC— received the distinction of “LGBTQ+ Healthcare Equality Leader” in March, marking the sixth time Keck Medicine Hospitals have received the distinction. This year, Student Health participated in the survey for the first time.
The title was only given to healthcare facilities that received a perfect score in the Human Rights Campaign Foundation’s 2022 Healthcare Equality Index. HRCF created the index in 2007 to create a national standard for LGBTQ+ patient care and examine the current state of healthcare facilities. 
Keck Medicine and Student Health performed flawlessly in four distinct criteria: non-discrimination & staff training, patient services & support, employee benefits & policies and patient & community engagement.
The commitment to open dialogue with the LGBTQ+ community and the ways in which Keck Medicine engages with the voices of students were key to the high rating, said Dr. Patty Pinanong, the lead physician of the Student Health gender-affirming care team.
Student Health created the gender-affirming care center in 2013, after Pinanong’s team was approached by students who expressed a need for affirming services at the University. Pinanong cited a 2015 survey by the National Center for Transgender Equality, which found that one-third of respondents who had seen a provider in the past year reported at least one negative experience with a doctor or other healthcare provider related to being transgender. This lack of affirming treatment widely reported by transgender individuals is one of the reasons why Student Health’s multidisciplinary team is determined to meet the needs of its patients. 
“We have people from our mental health team, Relationship and Sexual Violence Prevention and we also have members from our psychiatry team, so that’s the mental health component,” Pinanong said. “Then on the medical side, we want to make sure that we’re providing really affirming primary care.”
Student Health exclusively serves students, while Keck Medicine and its various hospitals serve patients from the greater Los Angeles area. Keck Medicine and its various hospitals had no gender-affirming care program until 2020, when the coronavirus pandemic provided an opportunity to redefine what it meant to have such a program. 
“When the pandemic happened, a lot of our inpatient services were curtailed. I had more time and this was the time to really start developing, ‘What [did we want our] gender affirming care program to look like?’” said Lindsey Morrison, process architect with Keck Medicine’s Office of Performance and Transformation and co-chair of Keck Pride, the LGBTQ+ employee resource group.
During these talks about the creation of a gender-affirming care program, Dr. Laura Taylor also was onboarded. Morrison said Taylor’s hire was the silver lining of the pandemic, as it gave an opportunity to build a strong gender-affirming care program with passionate and recently onboarded physicians.
Taylor now serves as the medical director of Keck’s Gender-Affirming Care Program. She provides primary care and hormone management for transgender, nonbinary and gender-nonconforming individuals, and is experienced in affirming preventive and gynecologic screenings, mental health, sexual health and HIV prevention, among other things. 
Alongside Taylor are other physicians and healthcare experts that work together to create a robust program offering services that include hormone therapy, voice therapy, STI testing and treatment, physical therapy, mental health care, gynecologic care, gender-affirming surgical and primary care and chronic disease management. 
“[We worked] with Dr. Pinanong and really [modeled] what Student Health had already done to make sure that we were creating a warm handoff between Student Health and the Hospitals when students needed to come over for surgical care or higher level care that Student Health can’t provide,” Morrison said.
Keck Medicine prides itself on its dedication to collaboration and the steps it has taken to ensure the high quality of gender affirming care, Taylor said.
“The thing that I think we’ve done is pushed for training. We’ve had a grassroots group of people who are interested in providing good care to the transgender and non-binary community and we’re working toward having more ongoing collaboration and training for all the physicians and providers involved,” Taylor said.
Keck Medicine formally entered a strategic collaboration with the TransLatin@ Coalition in March to improve access to specialized care for the transgender community. Taylor said this partnership enables Keck Medicine to center the voices of transgender individuals, further developing a program to suit the community’s needs.
“[The collaboration] has been really helpful to make sure that we are centering the needs and voices of trans people in the community,” Taylor said. “We’ve held focus groups and [have] been trying to understand how we should be doing this care in a patient-centered and community-centered way.”
Riley Davis, a licensed marriage and family therapist and clinical instructor of the department of psychiatry and behavioral sciences at Keck Medicine, said Student Health excels at interdisciplinary communication, allowing students timely access to the resources they need. 
“[In their counseling appointment], students will say, ‘Hey, I’m interested in going on hormones and how do I go about doing that?’ and I’m able to walk them through the process … and with  the student’s permission I can give a heads up to the medical provider and say, ‘Hey, this is what the student is going to be looking for and vice versa,’” Davis said. 
Keck Medicine and Student Health work together to offer student patients a wide variety of resources, and the community of doctors and counselors help advocate for students every step of the way. Altogether, the gender-affirming care programs both at Student Health and the broader Keck Medicine hospitals, Morisson said, represents the future of transgender/gender-nonconforming and LGBTQ+ healthcare.
“Because of the passionate, incredible people we’ve got involved, I see USC as being a world class, gender-affirming care program,” Morisson said. “For anybody — for students, for adults — I really see us being a destination for care.”

With the Trojans taking down their crosstown rivals after last Saturday, they’re gearing up to try and take down Notre Dame, their rival of almost 100 years.
After beating UCLA 48-45 in a thrilling matchup that earned USC a spot in the Pac-12 Championship game, the Trojans have moved up to No. 5 in the AP Poll and are very much in contention for the College Football Playoff. 
Sophomore quarterback Caleb Williams picked the perfect time to have his best game as a Trojan, having 503 all- purpose yards, the most by any Trojan quarterback in USC history. He threw for two touchdown passes and rushed for one, making his case even stronger to his already impressive Heisman Trophy resumé. He now has a chance to add on to that with this crucial regular season finale. 
“He’s been one of the best players in the country this year. He’s really played well,” Head Coach Lincoln Riley said about Williams after Saturday’s win. 
However, he wanted to emphasize that the most important thing is the team going 1-0 each and every week before anything else. 
“It’s got to stay about the ball, and that’s the most important thing,” said Riley. “I know that’s the most important thing to him and all of us. Maybe those things come to fruition, that’s great, but those are byproducts.”
Notre Dame had a terrible start to their season, with rookie Head Coach Marcus Freeman starting off 3-3 and losing to Marshall and Stanford at home. The Fighting Irish have had very inconsistent quarterback play but have been a force in the run game. In their 44-0 route of Boston College, redshirt sophomore quarterback Drew Pyne completed 13 of 25 passes for 156 yards and a touchdown. Their ground game, however, had a combined 281 yards and 4 touchdowns.
The Trojan defense has struggled against the run this season, but held a Bruin rushing attack to just over 200 yards — not bad, considering that UCLA has been one of the best rushing teams in the country over the course of this season.
“We talk all the time that a play has to be made at the end of the game to win,” said defensive coordinator Alex Grinch. “If you’re not careful, the advantage goes to the offense because they know they have to make a play. On the defensive standpoint, we have to make sure we match that mentality wise.”
Notre Dame’s defense has had a strong season, ranked as a top 20 defense in the country and giving up only 317.5 yards per game this season. This will be the best defense that Riley’s offense will face, but the high-scoring unit led by Williams could prove to be a challenge for the Fighting Irish.
True freshman cornerback Benjamin Morrison has had 5 interceptions over the last three games. Redshirt junior defensive lineman Isaiah Foskey has had 9.5 sacks this season, and looks to be a first round pick in this year’s NFL draft. 
The last time the Trojans beat Notre Dame was in 2016, a 45-27 home victory. Not only would a win make USC’s case to make the College Football Playoff a lot stronger, but it would be a huge moral victory for the team, signifying a new era in this blue blood rivalry between two historic college football programs.
For all the change the program has gone through over the past year, along with their play on the field, the tight bond in the locker room is why the team is now 10-1, and in the Pac-12 championship.
“Thinking back to when we all got here, the main thing we wanted to do was come together and have an unbreakable brotherhood,” said senior linebacker Shane Lee. “I think that’s the biggest reason why we’re here and that’s what’s going to keep getting us in these big games and keep leading us to success, is just how much we can rely on each other and just love each other, honestly.”
A win against Notre Dame, combined with a Pac-12 championship, would almost guarantee a spot in the College Football Playoff for the first time in program history.

The NBA season has seen perennial contenders, such as the Golden State Warriors or LeBron James’ Los Angeles Lakers, struggle in the first month of action. While USC is obviously a west coast school, it is in the Eastern Conference that Trojans have found the most success this year. 
Power forward/center Evan Mobley, Cleveland Cavaliers
Joined now by his brother Isaiah, Evan Mobley has built on his strong rookie year with a solid start to his sophomore season in the NBA. Averaging 15.5 points in 16 games, the former USC star has been an integral part of the Cavs’ early season success. Sitting at 10-6 and fourth in the Eastern Conference, the addition of star shooting guard Donovan Mitchell from the Utah Jazz has proven to be the correct decision for a Cleveland team that missed the playoffs last season despite having a talented young core made up of Mobley, point guard Darius Garland and center Jarrett Allen. Allen and Mobley, both standing at 6-foot-11 or taller, complement each other well in the paint, spacing out the defense and creating space for Garland to drive and shoot or dump it off to one of the big men. Mobley’s height is also an advantage on the defensive side of the ball, as he is averaging a team-high 1.4 blocks per game. 
Power forward Onyeka Okongwu, Atlanta Hawks
Sitting just in front of the Cavs at third in the Eastern Conference are Onyeka Okongwu and the Atlanta Hawks. The 2020 sixth-overall pick has solidified a spot as a key role player on a deep Hawks roster. Okongwu has contributed 7.4 points and 5.7 rebounds per game, averaging just under 20 minutes a game. With a 64.9 shooting percentage, Okongwu has established himself as a reliable option in the paint. Okongwu is also a menace on the defensive side of the ball,  thanks to his 6-foot-9 frame and impressive vertical jump, sporting a 109.2 defensive rating this season. 
Shooting guard Kevin Porter Jr., Houston Rockets
While the Rockets have sputtered to a 3-14 start, good for last place in the Western Conference, Porter Jr. has taken advantage of his starting spot on a team with questionable depth. Averaging 19.8 points, 6.1 rebounds and a team-high 5.8 assists per game, Porter Jr. is having the best statistical season of his career. His rebounding ability stands out as an improvement from previous years, averaging 1.7 more boards per game than last year. Although the Rockets have miles to go in terms of competing for a championship, Porter Jr. is proving his capability to contribute quality minutes as a starter in the NBA.
Small forward DeMar DeRozan and center Nikola Vucevic, Chicago Bulls
Two former Trojans reunited in Chicago after DeRozan was traded from San Antonio last season. Both members of the 2009 USC team, DeRozan leads the Bulls with 25.2 points per game and Vucevic with 11.7 rebounds per game. The Bulls, who finished as a sixth seed in the playoffs last year, have gotten off to a rocky start with a 6-10 record this season. DeRozan is a skilled ball handler and can make contested shots, while Vucevic can park in the paint and post up on defenders for the score. However talented though, the duo has more work to do, as the Bulls are currently on the outside looking in if the playoffs started today.

Exactly 367 days ago, USC suffered its worst defeat to UCLA in rivalry game history, a stunning 62-33 loss at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum. It was the second of four games the Trojans would lose in a row to close the season.A week after that loss to the Bruins, Lincoln Riley was named head coach. A year later, USC is in a position many could not have imagined — a spot clinched in the Pac-12 Championship game. 
“If you would have told me at the end of last season that I’d be here now with this group of guys and be able to go play for a championship I’d call you a dead liar,” said redshirt junior wide receiver Kyle Ford. 
Well, it’s come true for the Trojans. A year after going 4-8, No. 5 USC is 10-1 and in its first conference championship game in a full season since 2017. All it took was a wild 48-45 victory against No. 17 UCLA at the Rose Bowl. 
Here are four takeaways from the game. 
Potential career-altering play from Korey Foreman
The Trojans announced sophomore edge Korey Foreman’s commitment to USC in 2021 with a billboard near the 110 freeway. It was a bold move but warranted for someone who is the third-highest player to ever commit to USC, according to 247 Sports. Since then, Foreman’s Trojan career has been up and down. 
He had 2.5 sacks last season and has none this year. He even played no snaps against Oregon State in September, even though he was fully healthy. Riley mentioned last month, however, that Foreman was on the cusp of making an impact on the field. 
Almost exactly one month after that quote, Foreman made the biggest play of the game Saturday, intercepting UCLA’s redshirt senior quarterback Dorian Thompson-Robinson to seal USC’s victory. 
“I can’t thank this team enough because they put me in that situation,” Foreman said. “I thank everybody for allowing me to just, man, I’m blessed to be in the position I am right now.” 
Before the interception, Foreman was pacing back and forth on the sidelines saying to himself a play had to be made “right here, right now.”
It’s a moment that defensive coordinator Alex Grinch said they were waiting for, one that could serve as a catalyst for the former No. 1 recruit. Unleashing Foreman’s potential in the final month of the season can make a huge difference for the Trojans. 
He shared a moment on the field with Riley too, proving the head coach’s comments true from a month ago.
“Excited for Korey. He’s worked hard behind the scenes and a great example of don’t worry about any outside expectations or what other people think, it doesn’t matter, you just keep working, improving and good things happen,” Riley said. “And he’s done a great job of that.”
Caleb Williams has his Heisman moment
With three more weeks remaining until Heisman voting is due, sophomore quarterback Caleb Williams might have had his moment. 
He threw for a career-high 472 yards on a season-high 74.4% completion rate for 2 touchdowns in the air and one on the ground. Time and time again he made key plays to keep USC alive. Nine receivers had a reception too, a testament to the quarterback’s ability to spread the wealth.
He did, however, throw his third interception of the season. But it was just a thorn in a seemingly flawless game at the Rose Bowl, as Williams’ play propelled the Trojans to victory.
“He’s been one of the best players in the country this year,” Riley said. “He’s played really well.”  
After his spectacular game, Williams is now the odds-on favorite to win the Heisman award. 
And it wasn’t just what he was doing on the field that made an impact. On the sidelines, Williams was staying loose, dancing in moments of crisis, something that kept the team comfortable with their backs against the wall. 
His leadership was on full display Saturday night.
“He’s a competitor. He’s so confident in himself but it doesn’t come off in a cocky way and I think he really knows how to rally the guys and make everyone comfortable,” redshirt senior center Brett Neilon said. “He just believes in this team and he believes in himself.” 
Williams’ 503 total yards were also the most anyone has ever had in 92 meetings between the crosstown rivals. 
Austin Jones fills in nicely for Travis Dye
After a season-ending injury for redshirt senior running back Travis Dye, it became evident the running back room would look completely different. 
Senior running back Austin Jones stepped in as the no. 1 back leading the team in carries with 11 on Saturday. He racked up a season-high of 120 yards rushing and 57 yards receiving. Jones provided a reliant attack on the ground with consistency carrying the ball. 
Even though he fell down in the depth chart as the season progressed, the veteran running back stayed ready, making the most of his opportunity when it counted.
“He was huge, but like exactly what we expected him to be, exactly what he has been,” Riley said. “There’s not one person in that locker room surprised about the way he plays.” 
Defense limits UCLA’s rushing attack
Going into Saturday night, Bruins senior running back Zach Charbonnet ran for over 100 yards in seven of UCLA’s eight games. USC allows over 140 rushing yards per game, making the case that Charbonnet would easily continue that streak.  
He didn’t though, running for just 95 yards on 5 yards per carry — his lowest total of the season. UCLA as a whole typically averages the sixth most rushing yards per game at 238. But, the Bruins ran for 204 yards, their lowest total since playing Oregon. 
Grinch joked the key to stopping Charbonnet was one word: “Tuli [Tuipoluto].” 
“Trying to move him around and try to have an impact. And so it kind of hit a few times and [we] kind of stuck with that,” Grinch said. “So that was critical.”
A defense that was struggling to stop the run did exactly that for the most part, a potential confidence booster going into the final weeks of the season. It won’t get easier down the stretch with Notre Dame and potentially Oregon, Utah or Washington in the conference championship game.
