Friday night’s matchup between USC and No. 10 Utah was one of the most highly anticipated games of the past few seasons for the Trojans — not just because it had a chance to decide the winner of the Pac-12 South, but because former Trojan running back Reggie Bush was making his return to the Coliseum as a broadcaster. 
The “Reggie, Reggie” postgame chants from USC fans didn’t come as a surprise, but the guest on Bush’s FOX postgame show — redshirt junior quarterback Matt Fink — did. 
After freshman quarterback Kedon Slovis went down with an injury on the second play from scrimmage, Fink’s 351 yards and three touchdowns helped USC to a 30-23 victory over Utah at the Coliseum. 
“I can’t tell you how proud I am of [Fink],” head coach Clay Helton said. “In today’s world, things don’t always go your way, and you live through adversity, and you say, ‘Hey, you know what, when my opportunity comes, I’m going to make the most of it.’”
After the game, Fink said he knew he was prepared for the opportunity and was not fazed by the pressure.
“Just do my job,” Fink said. “I don’t think this moment was too big for me.” 
It has been a turbulent journey for Fink. In the offseason, even before he was named the third-stringer, he entered the transfer portal and took a visit to the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. However, the talent level at USC brought him back, and he mentioned that his bond with his teammates helped him push through the disappointment.
Fink connected with senior wide receiver Michael Pittman Jr. for a staggering 232 yards on the night — a career-high for the tenured receiver. 
“Matt’s not scared to take shots,” Pittman said after the game. “He’ll look at me and then give me the signal, and I know that he’s probably going to throw that pass.” 
Pittman’s highlight of the night was a career-high 77-yard touchdown on USC’s first drive of the third quarter. Pittman said he thought Utah knew the ball was going to him after his hot start, but that it didn’t matter. 
“They just couldn’t stop me,” he said after the game, smiling.
Wide receivers redshirt junior Tyler Vaughns and sophomore Amon-Ra St. Brown also scored on USC’s first two drives, early signs that the unit would steal the show for the Trojans. 
While Fink’s excellent start was certainly the story of the first half, USC wouldn’t have entered halftime ahead if not for several Utah mistakes. The Utes set themselves back on almost every offensive drive and were flagged nine times for 75 yards in the first half alone. 
Utah’s sloppy play was not confined to penalties, though. Right before halftime, Utah had the ball at USC’s 2-yard line and a go-ahead touchdown looked inevitable. However, with 16 seconds remaining, Trojan sophomore inside linebacker Palaie Gaoteote IV forced sophomore running back Devin Brumfield to fumble. Redshirt sophomore cornerback Greg Johnson scooped it up, and USC was ahead at the break. 
It was a lead USC would not relinquish.
Utah eventually made it a 21-20 game, appearing to have all the momentum on its side when it forced USC to punt with under 10 minutes left in the game.
That’s when the defense stepped up. 
After redshirt freshman punter Ben Griffiths pinned the Utes at their 6-yard line in the middle of the fourth, freshman defensive lineman Drake Jackson pressured Utah senior quarterback Tyler Huntley in the end zone, forcing an intentional grounding and a safety. 
The play was the capstone of USC’s improved pursuit of Huntley in the second half. The Utes’ signal-caller rushed for 48 yards in the first half compared to just 12 in the second. 
“We really just wanted to keep him in the pocket, so we just rushed him at a certain rate to where he couldn’t get out or get around us,” Jackson said. 
After the ensuing punt, a 42-yard pass from Fink to Pittman led to a 4-yard touchdown run from redshirt freshman tailback Markese Stepp, putting the Trojans up 30-20. 
Utah responded with a field goal, but USC picked up a few first downs to run out the clock and seal the win. 
The Trojans’ rushing unit — which picked up only 13 yards compared to Utah’s 247 — managed to do just enough. 
“What I’m most proud of, though, is we get the ball on a four-minute drive when you gotta have it, everyone knows we’re going to run it, we competed and found a way to do it,” offensive coordinator Graham Harrell said after the game.
USC football, now No. 21 in the AP Poll, is used to being the dominant team targeted by others, not the underdog pulling the upset. However, Fink said he believes this team is on its way to returning to college football’s elite.
“You have the best players in the nation here,” Fink said. “I’m saying that ‘SC is on the rise. We have guys that are going to push us to the top here.”

Thousands of faculty, students, staff and alumni crowded Alumni Park Friday to watch Carol Folt be sworn in as the 12th president and the first female president to lead the University. Accompanied by the USC “Fight Song,” Folt made her way from the Bovard Administration Building to the steps of Doheny Memorial Library, sporting a cardinal robe, high-fiving students and throwing up a “Fight On.”
She trailed behind Wanda Austin, who served as the interim president for the 2018-19 school year until Folt assumed the position July 1. At the ceremony, Austin presented Folt with a gold medallion, officially handing off the office of president.
The inauguration marked a moment in history. USC was thrown into the spotlight multiple times in the past few years — following lawsuits in which hundreds of patients accused two former campus doctors of sexual assault and following the revelations of Operation Varsity Blues, 
With this inauguration, USC is filtering out years riddled with scandals in exchange for Folt, who aims to bring the University to new heights.
“I want to assure you that we will continue to tackle these problems until they are corrected,” she said to the audience. “We’re going to do it with urgency, and we’re going to do it with your involvement, with the involvement of the community and our governance structures.”
Folt discussed her goals to limit student debt, increase sustainability, form stronger partnerships with the surrounding community and work to rebuild trust and accountability at the University. 
When new Provost Charles Zukoski starts his position Oct. 1, Folt said he will head a group to “overhaul admissions” following the FBI investigation that found over 20 students had been admitted to USC as part of a backdoor scheme that involved bribe money and false athletic profiles. 
“We are going to do a deep dive into this whole thing that happened through Varsity Blues, that we are going to understand our admission process from the start,” Folt said in an interview with the Daily Trojan following the ceremony. “… And that’s not because I think we have lots of problems, but … we have to make sure first, we need to make sure how it happened, how to make sure it doesn’t happen again.”

Lauren Abbattista, a junior majoring in environmental studies, said she was excited to hear about Folt’s focus on campus sustainability efforts.
“She really values what students want,” Abbattista said. “I just would encourage her and hope that she continues encouraging interaction with students and open dialogue.”
Carol Folt has emphasized that she wants her tenure to be a “student-led” presidency. As students processed to their seats at the inauguration Friday, Folt ran down from the stage to take a photo with them before the ceremony began. 
Folt has also said that she will listen to perspectives from across the University community in her decision making, including consulting faculty and staff on changes. Edith Umugiraneza, an indexer at the Shoah Foundation, said she is excited for the changes to come with Folt, including a transportation subsidy program that was announced Sept. 17 that will cover half the cost of public transit for all staff that will begin Oct. 1. 
“I think she comes in with a lot of energy [and] motivation, and so many changes,” Umugiraneza said. 
As she settles into her role, Folt has said she will continue to meet with students and other campus stakeholders to include them on decisions. She recently announced a search committee for a new athletic director, which will include school officials as well as two student athletes. Two student representatives were also included in the provost search committee  after the University was criticized by Undergraduate Student Government for not involving student voices. 
Folt said in her speech that she spoke with Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti — who was in attendance Friday — last week to discuss how the University and city could work together to create change.
“We talked about the really deep needs of our communities, about how we could work together to combat inequities in health, in wealth and in education,” she said. “And we agreed that everyday that we delay on taking meaningful action on sustainability, we are pushing the environment into futures that we don’t want for our kids or our grandkids or any of your families.”
Once she stepped on stage for her speech, Folt was interrupted by about six protesters shouting, “Who do you serve? Who do you protect?” from the steps of the von KleinSmid Center. The protesters held a banner that read “#SilenceSam,” referencing the 8-foot commemorative statue of a Confederate soldier that marked the entrance of the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill’s campus until it was toppled by protesters in August 2018. 
Before leaving UNC in January, Folt, who was then the chancellor, removed the statue’s base, but UNC students previously told the Daily Trojan they felt this action should have come sooner. 
“I have been around protests my entire life at a university, and as a student I think universities have and must and should allow protest,” Folt said. 
Earlier Friday morning, the Daily Trojan reported that a bust of Rufus von KleinSmid, USC’s fifth president who was heavily involved in the eugenicist movement, was found covered with a cloth scribbled with the words “Rename VKC,” accompanied with a sign that read “Nazi.” 
Folt said she expected protests over the building’s name and would be looking further into the issue with Zukoski once he comes to campus. 
“I know that people are concerned about that, and I know there’s been a whole committee put in place to consider naming, which we need to do,” Folt told the Daily Trojan. “That would be a really good thing to do. It actually comes up through the Provost … but I’ll get involved in it.”
Before Folt took the stage, the ceremony started with an invocation from Dean of Religious Life Varun Soni, with Board of Trustees Chairman Rick Caruso coming forward to celebrate USC’s new chapter with the University community. 
“After the most turbulent period in USC’s history, today is a reflection on the actions we have taken, and the work that will begin anew,” Caruso said. “We are in the midst of relieving and restoring the original fabric of this great University.” 
In her interview with the Daily Trojan, Folt said she is excited about upholding the University to proper sustainability practices, but in the process, bring the USC community together. 
“The fact that I get cheers for sustainability is just music to my ears, I love that, but it’s much more than just cheers,” Folt said. “We can start making progress, but what I have to do is tap into everybody. It’s one of those ones where everyone can be going in so many different directions — what if we all came together?” 
Malika Seth, a graduate student studying computer science, said seeing Folt installed as the first female president of USC should encourage women in the USC community and in general to rise to the highest levels in whatever they do.
“It shows all of us female students that we are well-represented within the USC community, and I think it makes us feel really comfortable that we have someone to look up to so it’s an inspirational thing as well,” Seth said.

A bust of Rufus VonKleinsmid was found vandalized Friday morning at the VonKleinsmid Center, hours before Carol Folt was set to be sworn in as president of the University. 
According to a photo acquired by the Daily Trojan, the bust’s face was covered in a cloth with the words “rename VKC” written across it and a piece of cardboard with the word “nazi” hanging around its neck. Department of Public Safety Assistant Chief David Carlisle said that they are in the preliminary stages of investigating the incident.
VonKleinsmid holds a controversial legacy at USC. Along with being the University’s fifth president, he was a known eugenicist, someone encourages the reproduction of desirable traits, generally among white people, and discourages reproduction among people with negative traits, which included the poor and people of color, both of whom were deemed intellectually inferior.
During his tenure at the University, VonKleinsmid co-founded a think tank that promoted sterilization “to improve civilization.” A 2017 Daily Trojan article reported that  “A Nation of Imbeciles,” a 2015 paper published in the “Chapman Historical Review,” found that the organization influenced Nazi Germany’s eugenics-based ideology through connections with top German intellectuals and officials.
“What needs to be understood is that this is not an issue of a few students disliking USC’s history or simply a representation of what the norm was at the time; calls to rename buildings are, however, an active movement to remove racism from the pedestal and a process in which history is accurately represented — not slanted — by the narratives of exceptionalism commonplace in American universities,” a Daily Trojan Opinion writer wrote in 2016, after a University study revealed VonKleinsmid’s controversial past.
While USC has not yet released a statement on the incident, USG Vice President Mahin Tahsin and USG President Trenton Stone said in a statement to the Daily Trojan that they have been in touch with Vice President for Student Affairs Winston Crisp.
“USG just last week appointed three members to the Nomenclature Task Force and the group should be meeting soon,” they said in the statement. “We hope this will be a formal place to be able to evaluate names, images, and symbols on campus and prove to be effective in making everyone feel more comfortable attending USC.”
USG did not comment on the specifics of the incident.
Students have asked the University to rename the structure for years. In March 2018, the Undergraduate Student Government Senate voted in favor of creating a task force to rename the building.
In February, former Provost Michael Quick announced the creation of a task force on University nomenclature. The group is responsible for defining principles and processes for faculty, staff and students to submit concerns regarding campus building names, symbols and monuments, according to a memo sent to the USC community.
“The principles should be broad enough to be applied to a variety of circumstances rather than tailored to a particular issue or controversy, and the Task Force should not deal with any particular issue or controversy,” Quick wrote in a letter then. “The Task Force should weigh all relevant considerations and develop criteria for making such decisions.”
Folt is no stranger to addressing controversial monuments. During her time at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Folt made the decision to remove the pedestal where “Silent Sam,” a campus Confederate statue, once stood. The fall before, students protested and took down the statue at UNC. After her controversial decision, UNC’s Board of Governors asked Folt to resign — months earlier than she anticipated.

When Carol Folt completed her tenure as the 11th chancellor of the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, she left the university in better shape than she had found it. As UNC’s first female chancellor, Folt successfully steered the university through two major controversies — the university’s academic-athletic scandal and the events surrounding the fall of the Confederate monument known as Silent Sam.
Similar to her arrival at USC, Folt was inaugurated as UNC’s chancellor amid one of the biggest scandals ever to rack the institution. Throughout the course of the NCAA’s investigation into alleged fraud and academic dishonesty committed at the university, Folt remained steadfast in her messaging, accepting responsibility for gaps in oversight while insisting that no NCAA violations were committed.
Folt’s deft navigation of the NCAA’s investigation provided the first line item on her resume as a university crisis leader. Her maneuvering of Silent Sam’s political and legal challenges cemented her legacy as a bona fide problem-solver.
With vocal critics on both the left and right, Folt frequently found herself in unwinnable situations. Folt’s measured approach to the issue of Silent Sam rubbed some student activists the wrong way, yet her hands were tied by a 2015 North Carolina law that generally bars the relocation of historic monuments. 
On the other end of the spectrum, Folt had a strained relationship with the right-leaning UNC Board of Governors, which felt that Folt was overstepping her duties.
Nearly five months after protestors toppled Silent Sam, Folt  — citing “a continuing threat both to the personal safety and well-being of our community” — finished their work by authorizing the removal of the statue’s base and commemorative plaques in her resignation letter to the UNC community. Folt’s actions received immediate praise from Representative David Price and North Carolina Governor Roy Cooper, and the student body president said that Folt would have a legacy of being “here to work and to serve students.”
Still, other student leaders reacted to Folt’s resignation by saying they would remember Folt for “systematically silencing us, systematically ignoring us and telling us to our faces that the violence that we’re experiencing and that we’re confronting on a daily basis doesn’t matter.”
Whatever the feelings on Folt’s time as chancellor of UNC, the results of her tenure are undeniable. She successfully led the university through its most difficult period in recent history. The skills she gained in North Carolina will serve her well as she navigates new challenges in Southern California.

Scandals and corruption have become all too common at USC in the past few years. Sparing statements on the obvious and already known, it could not be said any louder or more clearly that new leadership at USC ought to be a force in enacting drastic change. 
Issues concerning accountability, transparency and prioritization of the health and wellness of the student body should be at the forefront of concerns for President Carol Folt and her slew of new hires to work to address.
President Folt’s previous experiences as chancellor at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill seem to underscore USC’s hope to disassociate the school’s reputation rife with constantly occurring scandals. During her time at UNC, Folt was responsible for overseeing numerous campus controversies: academic fraud concerns with student athletes and no-show classes, which resulted in an NCAA probe, and the removal of a historical Confederate landmark, Silent Sam. Her arrival to USC was met with open arms, but the community is anxiously awaiting her implementation of institutional changes, which some students hope to be addressed during her inauguration speech. 
Through President Folt’s leadership thus far, USC has also found two new additions to the administration with the appointments of Provost and Senior Vice President for Academic Affairs Charles Zukoski and Vice President of Student Affairs Winston Crisp. Both positions, similar to that of President Folt, are filled by figures of senior experience in their respective administrative fields. 
Under Zukoski’s leadership, the University at Buffalo’s former Provost witnessed the diversification of its student body, increased its graduation rates and improved the general education requirements, with emphasis on interdisciplinary approaches and created new global learning programs. Diversity among the student body has been a constant and continual hope within admissions at USC. As a university that is also known for its broad range of programs and fields, USC will hopefully benefit from his past work on strengthening our general education requirements, as well. 
Like President Folt, Winston Crisp comes to USC from UNC as the former vice chancellor of student affairs. He has largely credited his approaches to student engagement and support to being a first-generation college student, having stated before that he owes his career and everything else he has accomplished to his access to higher education, an opportunity that no one else in his family before him had. While at UNC, Crisp was responsible for the creation of the institution’s Mental Health Task Force, which sought to assess the mental health needs of students and make recommendations and changes in policies for better mental health care. 
There is plenty of space for Crisp’s work to take shape here; one in every six students at USC is a first generation college student, and a mental health task force should be implemented as well. 
The credibility of our new leaders is confirmed by past experiences and knowledge in administrative roles. However, it is important that, in addition to their perceived efficiency in running institutions of higher education, they govern with accountability, transparency, concern and regard for the students, which the previous USC administration lacked. Among all the scandals and corruption the USC community has witnessed, the University has grown in popularity and reputation, while it has fallen in dignity and public confidence. 
While Folt’s background shows evidence of being able to overcome controversy and scandal, it is also hopeful that her time will be ethically and morally driven. As for the other new members of administration, their time in office should be spent tackling issues head-on rather than campaigning for something else. The USC community is looking forward to the construction of new institutions and policies within the school, commitments to decision-making that best reflect the values of USC and opportunities for positive transformation and growth under President Folt’s leadership.

The Department of Public Safety will have all hands on deck at President Carol Folt’s inauguration at Alumni Park Friday. The Department will deploy additional officers, surveillance cameras at the center of campus and put up barriers to prevent vehicles from entering.
Folt will be sworn in at the 12th presidential inauguration in USC history before a crowd of approximately 10,000 to 11,000 attendees, based on DPS estimations. Due to the size of the crowd, at least 95% of all DPS officers will attend or work in some capacity to ensure the safety of everyone throughout the day’s events, DPS Chief John Thomas said. There will also be a football game against the University of Utah Friday evening.
“Friday is going to be a very busy day for the University,” Assistant Chief David Carlisle said. “We’re expecting a very large crowd on campus for the events that will be going on.”
Additional CSC security officers will be on campus to help restrict traffic. DPS recommends that skateboarders, bicyclists and electric vehicle riders do not ride around the area.
Abiding by normal protocol, the Los Angeles Police Department will be on-scene as well with its bomb-sniffing dog to ensure there are no explosive devices at or around the campus.
DPS has also set in place live-monitoring surveillance cameras centered at Alumni Park. Being able to tilt and zoom on the cameras will allow the designated officers to track the large crowd throughout the event. 
“We’re going to focus a lot of cameras on the center campus,” Carlisle said. “We usually have five special surveillance officers trained to operate those cameras, patrolling the crowd with those surveillance cameras.”
DPS will also have special mobile barricades in place during the inauguration to ensure that no driver can intentionally enter the center of campus with a vehicle. “If somebody came in even driving a three-quarter-ton pickup at high speed, we’ll stop it,” Carlisle said. 
A DPS special intelligence officer is also working with LAPD to mine social media to prevent disruptions at the inauguration. 
“We monitor all social media in case we see something that concerns us,” Carlisle said.
While DPS does not anticipate any interferences, officers are prepared for worst-case scenarios. 
“We want to ensure the overall safety of the majority that everyone that is in attendance can enjoy this great day for the University,” Thomas said. “The No. 1 priority is ensuring that the event is safe and that we have taken all the necessary precautions.”
There will be an information area outside the Student Union building Friday so attendees can report public safety concerns. DPS will work with Fire Safety and student EMTs in the case of a medical emergency.
“I have every confidence that our dedicated department of public safety team and their first responder partners are prepared to ensure the safety of our campus community during this celebration of our community and our University,” Folt wrote in an email to the Daily Trojan.

Alumni, faculty and students gathered at Bovard Auditorium Thursday for the University Park Faculty Symposium celebrating research projects from 11 professors that focused on topics like sustainability, social change and mobility. 
Folt opened the presentation with praise for the Health Sciences Campus Symposium, which took place one day prior and for the interdisciplinary nature of the research being done on campus. 
Antonio Bento, a professor of public policy and economics, and Mahta Moghaddam, a professor of electrical engineering, opened the symposium by presenting their research project, the USC Center for Sustainability Solutions. The center, which opens next semester, aims to encourage conversation about climate change that will inspire the University and government bodies to create change. 
“I believe the future of the green economy starts here in Los Angeles,” said Bento, who is also the director the Center for Sustainability Solutions. He pointed specifically to the Los Angeles Green New Deal, county sustainability plans and the 2028 Olympics as platforms for community aspirations.
Bento said the city can design policy so that stakeholders will pay fees for causing environmental damage. The center’s project will also discuss technology that could solve climate change issues like air pollution and will highlight specific devices USC can use to address environmental issues on campus.
Also addressing issues relevant to downtown L.A., Eric Rice, associate professor at the Suzanne Dworak-Peck School of Social Work and co-founder of the USC Center for Artificial Intelligence in Society, focused his research on using artificial intelligence to help tackle HIV among homeless youth. Rice used AI to navigate social networks within the homeless community in Los Angeles and target certain members for a safe-sex training program.
“We train them in leadership skills and communication skills and empower them to go back out into their communities and spread the word about sexual health with their friends,” Rice said. 
Realizing that youth would rather learn from their peers than adults, they implemented a system where the young people they train dispersed the information they learned to the rest of the community. Analyzing statistics from the project, it appears that this method has helped to ameliorate the issue of HIV among homeless youth at large.
Jennifer McQuiston Lott, an assistant professor of practice at the Kaufman School of Dance, and Andrew Norman, an associate professor of composition at the Thornton School of Music created a short film that combined contemporary choreography and chamber music composition. 
The film, titled “Caught in the Chamber,” looks at how music and dance can complement and enhance one another.
“In the end, we learned quite a lot from each other … and from our incredible performers and as with all great collaborations, the questions just get more questions and more opportunities for potential exploration” Lott said. 
Lott and Norman announced they are in the process of creating the second installment of the project, “Activated Chambers,” which will premiere in December.
Allissa Richardson, an assistant professor of communication and journalism, gave the final presentation, titled “Bearing Witness While Black,” which focused on the impact of new technology like smartphones on journalism. Richardson discussed case studies of historical events that highlighted police brutality and the effect of mobile journalism.
“Ten years ago, I started the first mobile journalism laboratory, and at the time I called it the MOJO lab,” Richardson said. “In this MOJO lab, my [students] went around with nothing but tablets and cell phones asking people questions, big and small.”
She discussed the accessibility that smartphones provide, allowing anyone to document and broadcast important events. Richardson specifically highlighted Black history and the empowerment mobile journalism has given rise to. 
Folt offered a few closing statements and more praise after the presentations had concluded. She expressed admiration and gratitude for the work being done by her colleagues.
“There’s courage, humor, grace, the future hard-cutting look at virtually everything we would want a university to be looking at, and that was just in 11 talks,” Folt said.

President Carol Folt’s inauguration is one for the books. While the former University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill chancellor is the first female president to be inaugurated in USC’s history, the ceremony is unique for another reason: its plan to achieve zero waste.
“As an ecologist, I have always been concerned with making sure we all do everything we can to sustain our planet,” Folt wrote in a statement to the Daily Trojan. “When I arrived at USC, I was so heartened by the sincere desire of our students, faculty, staff and [the] entire campus community, to do more to curb our environmental impact.”
Adam Rosen, vice president of the USC Office of Cultural Relations and University Events, said his department oversaw planning for the event and that he met with Folt to discuss her plans for the day.
“When I initially met with Dr. Folt, she said, ‘The one thing that I want is for this to be the greenest inauguration that has ever happened,’” Rosen said. “We sat down as a team to brainstorm from the event side … and brought in all of our campus partners.”
According to the USC Office of Sustainability, the ceremony makes “meaningful strides” in implementing and expanding the University’s sustainability efforts. Ellen Dux, associate director of the Office of Sustainability, said the ceremony’s ambition was a collaborative effort from various offices on campus, including Facilities Management Services, USC Auxiliary Services and the Office of the President, among others.
“[Folt] is using this public opportunity to signal to the broader community that this is a priority, and it speaks more broadly to aggressively advancing sustainability on our campus,” Dux said.
According to the office, the inauguration aims to divert 90% of trash away from local landfills. To achieve this goal, the ceremony will utilize compostable and recyclable materials and encourage all attendees to properly divert waste into color-coded bins.
The zero-waste inauguration fact sheet found on the office’s website identifies and breaks down the material that each item used at the inauguration is made of — everything from certifiably compostable napkins to disposable wooden forks and spoons.
“With inauguration, I wanted to make sure we set the tone early, even as we plan for more concrete initiatives that I look forward to working with our community to implement soon,” Folt wrote.
Dux said that while the operation may seem like a challenge, efforts to increase sustainability on campus are a joint effort between FMS, USC Hospitality, the administration and the public. 
“This is a very public moment for [Folt] and for USC, and she said ‘I want to put this first foot forward and signal to everyone who is watching that USC is committed … and serious about advancing sustainability,” Dux said. “But it’s not a closed loop, anyone can wander anywhere with a burrito from home or a huge jug of something in plastic.”
The factsheet outlines seven steps necessary to achieve a zero waste inauguration, including eliminating single-use plastics; reducing paper waste such as programs; using compostable serviceware; encourage caterers to minimize excess food; educate guests on waste diversion; donate leftover food to food banks; and work with waste haulers to track the destination of the ceremony’s waste. 
Rosen said the biggest challenge of the initiative has been working with the city to ensure that waste from the event is diverted away from landfills.
“When we first started this process, we didn’t think we would be able to compost properly,” Rosen said. “So working within the city’s confines and what the University is required to use was probably the hardest piece — this is where we lean on our partners.”
This is not the first large-scale event at USC that will be zero waste. In April, the Los Angeles County recognized the USC Office of Sustainability for making the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum a zero waste facility. For two years in a row, USC’s stadium also won the Pac-12 Conference Zero Waste Competition. However, Dux believes that achieving zero waste for the inauguration will be more challenging than the Coliseum.
“It’s one thing to do zero waste at the Coliseum, which is a huge venue but … the Coliseum is a closed loop — we control everything that goes in or out,” Dux said.
Helen Williams, a junior majoring in international relations and environmental studies, said she hopes the inauguration educates the community on zero waste practices.
“A lot of people, especially on campus, don’t know how to sort their waste and don’t know the proper ways to recycle, so having such a campus-wide event [where] everyone is invited and everyone is aware of the diversion of waste increases awareness about the movement and promotes sustainability,” Williams said.
Rosen hopes that the inauguration shows students who are concerned with sustainability on campus that the University is taking important steps toward change. 
“It’s lovely to see something like this coming to ’SC,” Rosen said. “An area where I have seen students complain about the lack of sustainability and the lack of initiatives around that.”
Williams believes that many students are often too busy with their day-to-day tasks to realize the need to be conscious and considerate of their habits. She hopes that Folt’s prioritization of sustainability will increase these conversations on campus.
“Having someone in the highest office on campus constantly remind us that [sustainability] is important and that environmental crises are happening will impact all of us,” Williams said.

Today is a significant day in USC’s 139-year history. Carol Folt will take center stage in Alumni Park for her inauguration as USC’s 12th president.
This event is a turning point for the University. In the face of troubled times, Folt ushers in an era of change. Though she joins the ranks of USC giants like Steven Sample and C. L. Max Nikias, her three months in office have already made history — Folt is the first woman to serve as president.
“The inauguration of USC’s next president marks the beginning of a new era of excellence in teaching and research, institutional accountability, and service to our local communities, the nation and the world,” Rick Caruso, Chair of the Board of Trustees, wrote on the inauguration website.
For part of the ceremony, leaders and members of the community will march in an official processional. Students, staff, parents, alumni and community members representing everything from academic programs to student organizations, will march from the steps of Bovard Auditorium to Alumni Park. Select students will carry heraldic flags that will fly at the forefront of the procession, representing the University’s degree programs. 
Following the procession, the community will celebrate the inauguration with a luncheon at McCarthy Quad. 
Though the formal inauguration takes place this morning, the past week has been filled with celebration.
The Arts Showcase, which featured student work and performances, was held in Bovard Auditorium and Alumni Park Wednesday evening to honor USC’s arts schools and student creatives. The following day, Faculty Symposiums showcased innovative faculty work and research from several fields of study, from advances in artificial intelligence to dance in the digital age.
 Amid all the celebration, today’s ceremony marks a literal and figurative step forward for the University of Southern California.

Last month, Amazonian fires billowed over much of the South American rainforest as the rest of the world watched in horror. Most were set by man’s own hand, and our world’s lungs paid the price. Fire has become a symbol of how fast our climate is warming, how fierce man’s involvement in environmental degradation is and how apocalyptic the coming years could be. 
Fire doubles as evidence of a movement. One student can spark others to rally for climate action. Those students can spark a university to make sustainability a priority. That university can instigate statewide change and statewide change can be a model for a nation. A single spark can do so much damage, or so much good. 
Fire consumes oxygen. It pulls air from a room so that anyone near its embrace has no choice but to watch it grow. Likewise, the global environmental movement must become so huge that world leaders have no choice but to listen and make change. The combined force of student, parent, corporate and government action can be a monumental man-made fire that changes the face of this Earth. 
For centuries, Native American peoples used fire to decrease the risk of larger fires and to instigate growth in ecosystems. The fires were useful and cyclical; they were small but great. Within the global environmental movement exists small controlled burns that rapidly amplify a community and seek to keep the coming climate disaster from devastating more forests, more homes and more futures than it already will. 
Today, as President Carol Folt is inaugurated as USC’s first sustainability-minded president and the city shines a light on our community, students will gather at Tommy Trojan from 3 to 4:30 p.m., joining thousands of students worldwide who are refusing to remain idle as our Earth pleads for survival. Our goal is as follows:
In line with the Climate Strike Movement, we are striking for aggressive and urgent climate policy action that greatly reduces greenhouse gas emissions and ensures equity and justice for marginalized communities.
With your voice, with your time and with your ambition, join us in supporting a future of regrowth. Our world can persevere through man’s harm, but not if we continue to wait for someone else to make things better. It is up to all of us to ensure that our generation, our kids’ generation and myriad generations after will have a safe Earth to call home. The fire is burning. You can be a part of the fire that takes life away or the one that seeks to reinstate it.

At 2 a.m. on his first night of college, then-freshman Winston Crisp jerked awake to the sound of the fire alarm blaring. He sprang from his bed, scrambling to gather his thoughts as he rushed out of his dorm. After all, where he grew up, the fire alarm always signaled an emergency.
As he exited his dorm, Crisp realized that he was the only resident outside. There he found the residence hall director, who told him the incident was only a fire drill. 
“People were laughing at me, and I’ll never forget,” Crisp said. “I mean, it seems like a really dumb thing, but the notion that people just ignored stuff like that routinely . . . so I was always taking stuff seriously.”
Crisp’s college experience was marked by the fear that he was not supposed to be there — a sentiment he compared to imposter syndrome — and that he was going to be thrown out of school if he did anything wrong. 
“For a lot of people, when you come to college for the first time in your life, you’re surrounded by people who are all pretty much just as smart as you are,” Crisp said. “And then you start looking around at what they’re doing … And I had this panic that I’m doing it wrong.”
But with his college experience came insight that Crisp said he has carried to all the communities he’s served. After 26 years working in various student affairs positions at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Crisp followed President Carol Folt to USC as vice president for student affairs, officially beginning his position Aug. 16. Since then, Crisp said he has been meeting with various members of the University community and listening to their concerns.
“I am not the kind that comes in and just immediately starts,” Crisp said. “This is a great place with wonderful people so far, who all have a desire to see the place rise and to be better and to treat folks, and I’m trying to figure out how to best apply myself and my talents to make that better. And it’s going to take a little bit of time to learn.”
TURNING TO EDUCATION
Growing up, Crisp thought there were only two career paths he could follow to be successful: medicine and law.
It soon became clear which path Crisp would choose after taking his first biology class. When his class did frog dissections, he hid behind his lab partner and peered over her every so often as she cut through the cadaver. He immediately scratched med school off the list and set his sights on becoming an attorney. But as he got older, Crisp said he was not sure how much of that dream was his and how much of it was his family’s — another aspect of being a first-generation student, he said.
“When your entire family is pointed toward achieving something, how do you separate your own desires from [theirs]?” Crisp said. “But I had another desire, and I had another love that I was discovering. And that was education.”
Crisp’s family ingrained in him a deep respect for education, and he said he always knew he would go to college. His grandfather told him about generations of his family who had worked hard so that he could get an education, and Crisp’s parents made sure he maintained straight A’s before he stepped on a sports field as a student-athlete. 
When it came time to apply to college, he wasn’t sure how his family would afford the expense, but Johnson C. Smith University, a small HBCU in Charlotte, N.C. — a place he said was where “folks who didn’t necessarily have access could gain access” — and later the UNC School of Law offered him the scholarship money he needed.
“I don’t know anybody who can be truly successful by themselves, not in this world,” Crisp said. “And I think people who need to tell you that they are solely responsible for their success and the whole, ‘I pulled myself up by my bootstraps,’ I don’t subscribe to that. I think nobody gets anywhere without help.”
But once he stepped foot onto campus, Crisp said that he fell into assumptions about what college life would entail. He recalls thinking students were required to wear suits and ties to their classes. All of what he expected from the college environment stemmed from movies and books. 
“I felt like sometimes that I showed up like a month after everybody,” Crisp said. “Because … everyone had the whole college thing down, and their parents had been there. They had been shopping . . . and I’m looking at people’s residence hall rooms, and I showed up with one military footlocker and a military duffel bag because that’s all I owned.”
The turning point in Crisp’s education came from the relationships he developed with various mentors. At first, he hated one of his professors, who gave him C’s and told him she was grading him based on what he was capable of doing and didn’t do. In other words, Crisp said she was calling him lazy and that he was doing “just enough to break the curve.” But looking back, Crisp said she was one of his greatest influences because she refused to let him settle for anything less.
Another mentor, the dean of UNC School of Law, told Crisp he should consider pursuing education just as he was finishing up his law degree with plans to join the military. She contacted Crisp’s father as well as the colonel to stop him.
“I thought she was just completely derailing my life because I had a plan,” Crisp said. “I had a plan, and I was ready for my plan. … [But] the colonel told me at one point, ‘If you don’t take that job, I’m going to rescind your commission offer because you’re too young and stupid to understand what a gift you’re being handed.’”
And with that mentorship, Crisp changed his plans entirely, beginning his career as an educator at UNC. 
LOOKING BACK ON UNC
Jonathan Sauls, who worked in student affairs with Crisp at UNC for 14 years, said Crisp often gave out his phone number to the thousands of families in each incoming class when welcoming new students and parents to Chapel Hill. Sauls said that at a graduation ceremony last December, Folt commented on Crisp giving his number to so many families, and one mother stood up and yelled back, “Yep, still have your card, still have your number.”
“What it really did is in a tangible way affirm to people that he was sincere and authentic in saying that he cares about the well-being of our students,” Sauls said.
Sauls said that even years after graduating, students would check in with Crisp on their visits back to campus. 
Crisp often met with student organizations and leaders to discuss issues on campus, but Sauls said Crisp also made time to talk with and mentor students to give career advice or help students dealing with barriers to education — even inviting them into the office after the workday had ended. 
While she felt other UNC administrators struggled to listen to students, 2019 graduate Sarah Lundgren said Crisp seemed sincere in his efforts to help students feel heard. After student government leaders voted in 2017 to split into separate bodies representing undergraduate and graduate students, Crisp stepped in to help facilitate the change. 
Crisp was also appointed the              co-chair of the Chancellor’s Task Force on UNC History in 2015. Folt created the task force to reckon with the school’s past, both in terms of its contributions to society and its relation to issues of race, class and privilege. 
Crisp said he has tried to be consistent in his values over the course of his career, and his values always began with the health and safety of the students. 
“My philosophy is very simple, and you will get tired of me saying it: Every single student that comes to this University without regard to what adjective goes in front of the name is supposed to get the same shot at figuring this out,” Crisp said. “And if you aren’t healthy, if you’re not safe, if you don’t feel welcome, if you don’t feel like you have access to the same room, then that stuff is not going to happen.”
According to Crisp, Silent Sam, an 8-foot commemorative statue of a Confederate soldier that marked the entrance of the UNC campus for more than a century, created a health and safety issue among students. The statue sparked decades of protests, but with the support of conservative alumni and state legislators, Silent Sam stood standing until August 2018, when it was toppled by protestors. In January, Folt, who was then the UNC chancellor, removed the remnants of the statue before announcing her official departure from the university.
The Daily Tar Heel reported on texts and emails obtained by WRAL, a local publication, revealing Crisp’s position on the statue’s controversy before it was taken down. In the texts, UNC Chief of Staff for Student Affairs Christi Hurt texted Crisp, “You think they’re gonna take that thing down?” to which Crisp responded, “One can hope.” 
After the statue was uprooted, Crisp texted, “Whew. What a mess. Won’t be texting. You be very careful with text and email also. Call if you need.”
“When you have so much angst and anxiety and anger and fear … that it’s taken up the kind of time and energy and effort, and it becomes the central defining character of a place, then that place is not … discovering knowledge, educating and teaching people,” Crisp said. “My attitude was, ‘This [statue] is detrimental.’”
Lundgren, who worked as the digital managing editor for The Daily Tar Heel her senior year, said the administration seemed reactionary and closed off after the Silent Sam incident. 
“I’m not saying that that was Winston Crisp, but more so UNC administration in general,” she said. “I wouldn’t necessarily call that his mistake, but I would say in the administration he was part of, that was definitely the most notable problem.” 
While he was in retirement after leaving UNC, Crisp told Folt he wanted to return to education and student affairs. In the coming months, Folt accepted her position at USC, former Vice President for Student Affairs Ainsley Carry announced his resignation and Crisp applied for and accepted the job. As part of Folt’s plan to create a more student-led presidency, she included Crisp in her cabinet along with other key administrators, like the heads of finance and human resources, who will help advise her decisions. 
For others, Folt said the phrase “student-centered” may seem like a buzzword, but at UNC, she watched Crisp put that term into action through his efforts to get to know students and parents and work on efforts to cultivate a better campus and community.
“His contributions were to create a loving presence,” Folt said. “Even when there were things [students] didn’t like, they would have turned to him and say he was really important for us.”
HEALTH AND SAFETY AT THE FOREFRONT
In 2018, Crisp created a Mental Health Task Force at UNC that released a report the year following his retirement recommending nearly 60 changes related to Chapel Hill’s wellness and climate; identification, treatment and ongoing support and academic policies. 
But mental health became a focus of Crisp’s career over the past two decades. When he started his career in student affairs at the UNC School of Law, Crisp and his department worked with a student who had significant mental health challenges and saw him start to improve. Then in 1995, the student, Wendell Williamson, went off of his medication and shot two people: a student and a fellow Chapel Hill resident. Williamson was later found not guilty by way of insanity.
The shooting shocked the UNC community and the nation, and at first Crisp wondered if he had failed or allowed the incident to happen. As lawsuits and trials followed, Crisp said he watched conversations on mental health unfold at more universities and saw a change in how colleges and health centers approached their relationships with students.
When a gunman opened fire at Virginia Tech in 2007, leaving 32 people dead, presidents and vice presidents from ACC schools met to see how they could help the school move forward. Because Crisp had dealt with trauma on a campus before, he was sent to VT to help faculty and staff recover and rebuild as they prepared for an incoming class of students. 
“I spent a lot of time learning about grief and learning about how to move forward and learning about how to move populations forward,” Crisp said. “And I never expected to have that happen, and I never would have dreamed in a million years that it would happen.”
These two incidents helped define Crisp’s career and solidify his focus on campus wellness and safety. If community members don’t feel healthy and safe, he said they’ll never be able to focus on the academic and personal growth that mark the college experience.
As he settles into his role at USC, Crisp said he will likely deal with the same issues that face many college students: mental health, safety and relationship struggles. He’ll continue to meet with students, faculty and staff across campus to learn about the specific issues he can address at USC. 
“I also don’t think I’m going to be reinventing any wheels,” Crisp said. “I think there’s probably good work, and good people, from students all the way up who are already engaged in all of these things. My job is to figure out how can I integrate with that and facilitate and help and figure that out, and it’ll take a while to do that.”

The disco medley had been going for nearly 10 minutes, and there was no end in sight. Dozens of dancers sporting sparkly bell-bottoms danced tirelessly as musicians covered ‘70s classics like Chic’s “Le Freak” and the Bee Gees’ “Stayin’ Alive,” and the audience was on its feet before the number was halfway over.  
Although it very well could have been, the performance was neither a televised tribute nor an intergalactic aerobics class. It was the finale to a two-hour arts showcase celebrating the inauguration of Carol Folt, USC’s 12th president, and all the performers were students. 
The event, held at Bovard Auditorium and Alumni Memorial Park Wednesday evening, featured a lineup of student artists from a variety of schools and disciplines. In between musical numbers and group dance routines, students performed stand-up comedy acts, and audience members watched animated short films from the School of Cinematic Arts. 
Before and after the live event, attendees walked through an outdoor gallery of work from the Roski School of Art and Design and observed a colorful projections display on the front of Doheny Memorial Library. 
“The arts not only are building creativity, they can also speak to things that can’t be said any other way,” Folt said in her opening remarks. “If there was ever a time that we want to double down on the arts, it is right now.” 
Audience members responded enthusiastically to the show’s diverse lineup. Judith Shelton, an adjunct lecturer in the School of Dramatic Arts whose students performed stand-up comedy in the showcase, said her favorite part — after her students — was the final disco medley, arranged by award-winning musician Patrice Rushen, an  assistant professor of practice and chair of the Popular Music Program at the Thornton School of Music.
“It was perfect — there’s so much talent here,” Shelton said. “At the end, where we were all standing and dancing, it just filled the whole room with joy and hope for the future.” 
In her opening speech, Folt spoke about the importance of the arts at USC as she begins her tenure as president. Some audience members said they would like to see increased resources and performance opportunities for USC’s various artistic programs under her leadership. 
“I hope to see, in terms of USC’s future, more interdepartmental collaboration among animation students, music students [and] dance students, which is currently going on, but the more the better in my opinion,” said Eva Hill, a graduate student in the animation and digital arts program.  
The showcase also featured performances by Musical Theatre Repertory, a student theatre organization, and the SoCal VoCals, an undergraduate a cappella group. In an introductory speech, SDA Dean David Bridel described MTR as one of USC’s most vibrant student groups.
“They are entirely self-produced and self-funded, [and] everything they do is under their own initiative,” Bridel said in his speech. “They, like so many of the other artists … carry within them that mysterious flame of creativity … It’s something that is very hard to describe, but you know it when you see it.”
MTR President Tyler Ellis, a senior majoring in theatre, said the group began rehearsing at the beginning of the semester after Bridel chose two musical theatre songs for them from a list of options. They ended up settling on “The New World” from Jason Robert Brown’s “Songs for a New World” and “Run, Freedom, Run!” from the 2001 musical “Urinetown.” 
Ellis said the showcase made MTR group members feel “seen” by Folt and the University as a whole, something he said is rare for artists on campus. 
“We don’t often get nights like this; we don’t have the budget necessary,” Ellis said. “Just feeling … like we belong at this university and that we actually enrich the school — we don’t always feel that way as arts students, so it was a refreshing evening of celebration. I was lucky and honored to be a part of it.”

After two weeks of NFL football, one thing has become abundantly clear — the Saints are being conspired against by referees, and everyone outside of New Orleans is in on it. 
While doing my best Charlie Kelly impersonation to connect the dots of the conspiracy, I found myself focusing in on a different observation: the 2019 season is being dominated by Black quarterbacks. 
Nine black quarterbacks are set to start Week 3. However, this number isn’t the accomplishment. That comes from the undeniable production that said quarterbacks have collectively put on display early this season. 
The top three passing touchdown leaders, Lamar Jackson, Patrick Mahomes and Dak Prescott, are all Black. Two more — Jacoby Brissett and Russell Wilson — rank in the top 10, making half of the top 10 scoring quarterbacks in the league Black.
Despite the passing success of past greats like Warren Moon and Donovan McNabb, black quarterbacks have continuously been marginalized as pure scramblers, leading to a lack of recognition for their overall impact on the game. 
The marginalization and lack of recognition for Black quarterbacks is a plight shared by another prominent demographic: women in the rap industry. 
Similar to how the Black quarterbacks are only given credit for their running ability, female rappers only receive recognition as background music for the perceived “real show” of their bodies, resulting in the misjudgement that they are strippers rapping.
As someone who respects women and spends a lot of time listening to music, I would never describe female rappers in such a manner. Record Executive Jermaine Dupri, on the other hand, used those exact words to describe female rappers in an interview with People Magazine. 
However, much like Black quarterbacks, female rappers have surpassed their suppression to go on and dominate in their profession. 
Houston rapper Megan Thee Stallion and Baltimore Ravens quarterback Lamar Jackson are prime examples of using the ability that they are expected to have and pairing it with an ability that many insisted they didn’t. 
Megan Thee Stallion markets her body to attract an audience’s attention then engages that audience with a skilled flow and sexually aggressive lyricism that converts them into real fans. That combination of what people commonly associate women rappers with and the “unexpected” genuine skill she possesses sparked a “hot girl summer” that future generations will credit their creation to and earned the 24-year-old a Roc Nation record deal. 
Jackson’s selection in the 2018 NFL Draft was met with microaggressions of whether the Heisman Award-winning quarterback was better suited in the league as a running back. 
If you don’t follow sports and the idea of a successful quarterback making the switch to running back sounds strange to you, congratulations. You have more sense than some “esteemed” sports analysts.
After throwing for 324 yards and five touchdowns with a perfect passer rating Week 1 against the Dolphins, Jackson symbolically flipped off all his critics, reviewing his performance as “not bad for a running back.”
While Jackson and Megan Thee Stallion prove why their respective demographics should not be boxed in by their most distinctive quality, their peers have also been displaying their talent within their own communities. 
Contrary to the dual-threat play style of Jackson, Mahomes thrives mostly on his arm talent, which furthers a separate conspiracy theory of mine that he pulled a Little Mermaid-type stunt involving his voice reminiscent of Kermit the Frog and his ability to throw a football — but I digress.
Russell Wilson paired his legs with his arm to become a Super Bowl-winning quarterback and the highest paid player in the NFL — a formula that Dak Prescott and Deshaun Watson are currently replicating. 
On the music side of things, women rappers differ from the most publicized path set by Nicki Minaj and mastered by the likes of Cardi B and Megan Thee Stallion. 
Rapsody has used her lyricism to become a top ten rapper, male or female, Tierra Whack is one of the most creative minds in all of music and English rapper Little Simz released arguably a top five rap album of the year. The list of women rap stars goes on, with talents like Rico Nasty, Doja Cat and the City Girls continuing to put out quality content. 
The future is bright for women in rap, and it looks like they will be shining alongside black quarterbacks in the NFL, as names like Kyler Murray, Dwayne Haskins and Teddy Bridgewater all look like potential franchise quarterbacks.
Black quarterbacks and women rappers have been cast aside in their industries for as long as I can remember. In the past, every now and then a Cam Newton or a Nicki Minaj would claw their way to the top, but the recent widespread successes of their peers is making the climb a lot less steep for future generations.

It’s always the right SZN for Dinah Jane.
Almost exactly a year after dropping her debut solo single “Bottled Up,” the Polynesian queen’s career is on an ascent. Though her sound is reminiscent of early 2000s hip-hop and R&B, there’s a refreshing quality about her tracks. Her lyrics are relatable, her beats are danceable and, though we haven’t gotten a full-blown project, her fans are more than ready to see Jane in full solo swing.
Earlier this year, she surprised the Dinahsty with R&B-packed Dinah Jane 1, a three-song bundle that gave the world an introduction to what Jane is really about. Accompanied by two deeply personal tracks, ”Heard It All Before” is a standout in DJ’s discography. Ask Ariana Grande: she’s played the track during her arena tour as fans filed in to see the “thank u, next” singer perform.
After standing out as one of the five members of Fifth Harmony, she says DJ1 became a way for her to “break the ice” from being in the most successful girl group of our generation (yes, I’m biased) to becoming the blossoming solo artist she is today.
“There will most definitely be an R&B tone within my music, but it isn’t the only style to expect from me,” she explained. “I’m influenced and moved by everything.”
Though her circumstances have changed throughout the years — she started her career as a solo artist on “The X Factor” and spent a half-dozen years alongside Normani, Ally Brooke, Lauren Jauregui and Camila Cabello in 5H — a handful of things have remained constant with Jane. She continues to be a standout vocalist (see Fifth Harmony’s “Who Are You” and “Lonely Night” as examples) and she is still the down-to-earth, family-oriented person Harmonizers like me fell in love with years ago.
On a personal level, I’ve followed Dinah’s (and the other girls’) careers religiously: I’ve gifted them with personalized hot sauce bottles, won fan competitions to interview them and even ran a fan account not too long ago. The Fifth Harmony girls were my world — and now I’m excited to see them do their own thing and excel at what they do best: being themselves.
If there’s anyone I think you should stan, it’s Dinah Jane.

What was it like collabing with A Boogie wit da Hoodie on “SZNS”? I honestly have it on repeat! 
The fact that you have it on repeat makes me so happy! I originally wrote this record with the intention of a “wedding” song. How ironic, right? Coming from someone like me who is far from ready for that SZN — just so we’re clear! But, it’s honestly an honor to have someone as talented as him on this record. A Boogie embodied SZNS with his tone, his lyrics and direction of melody. I really wouldn’t have it any other way. 
What really hit home for me were his lyrics. I loved that this record brought out a raw and vulnerable side to this man speaking on behalf of all men who are down for their woman and own up to being in their feelings as much as us. We’re so used to hearing records out right now about ass shaking and throwin’ cash. I found this as an opportunity for whoever the male feature was going to be to express themselves wholeheartedly without holding back. 
You’re getting the chance to write more now. Tell me about your songwriting process. 
After joining and collaborating with so many brilliant and insanely talented writers and artists, I’ve learned that everyone has their own unique creative process, and I’ve included pieces of those experiences in my sessions. 
I feel like a sponge, and I’ve learned that it’s important to be one. I’m always a student. Most of my records are real life experiences about me, about my friends, about my family. I usually like to start with a concept and then have the producer take it where they hear it. 
What do you want Harmonizers (like me!) to know about your post-group ventures? How are you feeling, and what is the solo life like?
I’d say I’m so aware and cautious more so than ever with who I affiliate myself with. I’m so grateful for everything I’ve encountered in that era because it prepared me for my solo career. Musically, relationships, friendships, performances, my business — all of that. The music I’m creating now is the lane I feel so confident and honest in. [I’m] speaking my truth. I’ve traveled the world and seen so much, I honestly feel older than 22. I’m still learning to live in the moment and be 100% attentive to the little things; they really do matter.
I saw you perform at the BET Experience, and you gave off some strong Mariah Carey vibes — is Mariah a big inspiration for you? Why so? Who are some of your biggest inspirations? 
Mariah Carey is most definitely one of my biggest inspirations. She’s one of the few artists who’ve shaped my artistry. Beyoncé, Brandy, Aaliyah, Tamia, etc. You gotta learn from the greatest of all time. Sonically and melodically, I carry some of these artists’ styles within my music because they have such timeless records, style and stories that we still hold dear to our hearts. 
Mariah always had a message and strong vocals that made you say, “Oh shit, the bitch is sangin’!” I hope I can one day embody that era of real solid music where vocalists sing their heart and soul out and had a message to share of pain, love, insecurity, empowering women and social issues. 
Back in 2013, you tweeted: “When my brothers go to college, I HOPE they choose to go to my fav college #USC. Can’t wait for their season start next week!!!” I’ve also seen some posts of you rocking USC merch! Talk to me about your love for the University!
My family have always been die-hard Trojan fans! I’m the biggest daddy’s girl, so whatever my Popz liked, I did too. I remember when I was younger, I’d watch him play college football on the Xbox, and his team was always USC. That’s when I became familiar with the colors, the school and most importantly, the Trojan anthem! 
My uncle Hebron Fangupo played for the football team, and it boosted our love for the University even more. The football support system built within the school is the most solid foundation I’ve ever witnessed. My brothers are currently in high school, and my hope is that one day they will follow in the footsteps of my uncle and become a true Trojan so I can brag, brag, brag! I’ll sleep, live and breathe in the USC colors everywhere I go, ha!
What are some of the projects that you are currently working on? When should we expect new music and full album?
I would love to tell you what I’m up to, but I love to keep the suspense. Just enjoy the music I’ve released thus far, and know that the album is on its way. I’m in no rush to release because I have so much more to say and get off my chest. Just be ready to get in your feelings, dance your ass off on the weekends with your crew and to walk around with confidence knowing what you bring to the table! 
Lastly, this column is called “You Should Stan.” Why should people stan Dinah Jane?
You should stan Dinah Jane because she’s cute and a solid Trojan supporter.

The USC women’s golf team kicked off its 2019 campaign Monday at the ANNIKA Intercollegiate held at the Royal Golf Club in Lake Elmo, Minn. 
Heading into the tournament as Golfweek’s top ranked team, the Trojans entered the competition with high expectations, returning all but one member of last year’s squad that won a total of seven tournaments over the course of the season. 
However, things didn’t go exactly according to plan for the Trojans in their opening competition. USC got off to a rough start against a 12-team field which Golfweek called “the best field in women’s Div. 1 golf,” ending the first of the three-day tournament tied for fifth place out of 12 on the team leaderboard. 
Senior Aiko Leong said the group was caught off guard by the consistent 10-15 mile per hour winds throughout the tournament, noting that it doesn’t typically practice in those conditions. It added an extra challenge that Leong said affected the team’s performance.
“It’s hard to, I guess, control the shot when it’s that windy,” Leong said. “The ball might go somewhere completely [where] you don’t want it to go. The wind can take it the other way.”
Following the difficult start, day two was crucial for the players to get back on their feet and fight through some unexpected adversity — and they did. The top-ranked Trojans posted a second round mark of nine-under 279 and surged up the leaderboard to second place, distancing themselves from third-place Arkansas and moving within six shots of leader Wake Forest.  
Despite some of the group’s typical top performers going through some early season struggles, Leong praised the team for hanging in and competing. 
“I definitely know a lot of people who were not happy with how they played, but, at the end of day two we were second,” Leong said. “I know we can do way better and with some of our top players being a little off, I think it was OK. It was still a good team effort.”
On day three, the Trojans returned to their inconsistent form, finishing the tournament in fifth place at three over 867. 
Leong played exceptionally well over the final two days of the tournament, posting an impressive individual mark of three under for the whole tournament. She had an astounding second round in which she shot six under par, making her the top-placing Trojan at sixth overall.
Leong explained that mental clarity and composure were keys to her success. 
“I just know that I just made a lot of dumb mistakes in the first round,” she said. “I thought I could score lower, so for the next round I just tried not to let the stupid mistakes get to my head.”
Leong was accompanied in the top ten by junior Jennifer Chang, who tied for eighth at two under par.
Junior Alyaa Abdulghany got out to an exceptional start in the first two days of the tournament but struggled on day three, dropping from fifth to outside the top 10 in the final round. Abdulghany’s first two days, however, kept USC in the tournament while others took time to find their groove, as she went a combined four under par over the tournament’s first two rounds.
Although head coach Justin Silverstein’s unit was unable to put together a complete effort over the course of the competition, he and his staff have plenty of reason for optimism. Outstanding sporadic individual displays from Abdulghany, Leong and Chang should have those within the team and those following it eager to see what’s next. 
Any roster with five All-Americans on it is going to be expected to perform well in — if not win — every tournament it enters, and this USC team is no exception. Although the unit did not leave its season-opener with any hardware, the season is still promising for USC. 
The Trojans look to overcome the wind and the rest of the field at the Windy City Collegiate Invitational in Chicago, Ill., from Sept. 30 to Oct. 1.

When All-American third team junior midfielder Savannah Demelo suffered a season-ending injury this past offseason, the USC women’s soccer team suddenly had a gaping hole in its offensive unit. Demelo was third on the team in points last season with 28, so one question loomed large over USC’s season: Who would step up in her place?
The answer so far has undoubtedly been junior forward Tara McKeown, who is currently having a dream season for the No. 2-ranked Trojans. With 7 goals and six assists in just seven games, McKeown is on an offensive tear that has provided a much-needed spark to the Trojan offense, especially in key wins against tough teams like Florida State and Florida.  
McKeown has partnered up with sophomore forward Penelope Hocking, who led the team in points last season, to account for a total of 35 points this season — over half of the team’s total points. McKeown attributes their on-field success to their relationship off the pitch. 
“Before she even got here as a freshman, we had the opportunity to play together with the U20 World Cup team and since then, we’ve been close,” McKeown said. “We were able to develop a connection off the field first.” 
McKeown also has a close bond with junior midfielder Alea Hyatt, who has played with her since they were 7 years old. That was about the time that McKeown first began to play at a higher level while on a club team. 
“I started playing when I was around 4,” McKeown said. “When I was 6 or 7, my first club coach saw me at AYSO and asked me to come out for his team, and once I started that I’ve [played] club ever since.”  
To some, McKeown’s offensive outburst may seem like somewhat of a surprise. However, it’s hard to call this year a breakout. As a freshman and sophomore, McKeown was already impressive for the Trojans, starting 33 games total and recording 13 and 19 points, respectively.  
McKeown’s rise to the spotlight and her increased offensive productivity can be partially attributed to one simple change. In her first two seasons at USC, McKeown was more of an outside back and had fewer chances to attack on the offensive end. However, this offseason, in the wake of injuries and graduating players, there was an open position at forward, which gave McKeown the opportunity to play at her most natural spot.  
“When I was playing club I would play forward usually,” she said. “That was my main position until about like maybe the year before I came in [to USC]. I started playing more outside back because that’s what I was playing for the national team at the time.”
McKeown’s comfort on the attacking end can also be explained by her aggressive yet unselfish playing style. She noted that some of her strengths include her “vision and ability to not just score goals but help other people score goals.”
Her selfless attitude is also reflected in her willingness and ability to play a number of positions. By adapting so quickly from outside back to forward, McKeown demonstrates her elite versatility, which she says she developed as a young player.
“From a young age, my club coach always moved players around because he knew how important it was to be versatile,” McKeown said. “That’s where I learned to just go with the flow and play wherever my coach needs.”
As a result of her outstanding play, McKeown already has garnered national attention, recently being named the United Soccer Coaches National and Pac-12 Player of the Week. If she continues to play at her current pace, she should receive some serious consideration for the Pac-12 Player of the Year award, among other accolades. 
However, McKeown isn’t focused on the individual spotlight as much as the team’s success. 
“I can just do my best for each game and help my team win,” she said. “I don’t think it’s individual as much as a team goal we are trying to get to in the end.”
After college, McKeown said she hopes to continue to play as a professional, as she will declare for the National Women’s Soccer League draft when she graduates in 2021. Those hopes may certainly become a reality at the rate that she is progressing, and maybe one day, McKeown will play on the U.S. National Team. 
For now though, McKeown is focusing on bringing USC its third national championship — and if she keeps playing the way she has been, the sky’s the limit for the Trojans.
USC will take on Baylor in Waco, Texas, Friday at 4:00 p.m.
