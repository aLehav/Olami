The college football season came to a close Monday after Georgia’s historic 65-7 beatdown of Texas Christian University at SoFi Stadium. The good times will keep on rolling for Athens’ back-to-back champs, but an offseason of introspection awaits TCU and the rest of college football. While the USC Trojans avoided a similar national TV drubbing, a 15-point collapse to Tulane at the Cotton Bowl didn’t look much better on small screens across the country. 
Missed tackles doomed the Trojans at the Pac-12 Championship, and a porous run defense couldn’t even come close to stopping the Green Wave’s Tyjae Spears one month later. The offense will need to reload as well, with All-American wideout Jordan Addison and star running back Travis Dye leaving for the NFL. Here’s who USC is bringing in.
5-Stars
Malachi Nelson: The heir-apparent to the reigning Heisman’s throne, Nelson comes in as the No. 2 quarterback in the nation, just behind UT Austin commit Arch Manning. Equipped with a 6’3” frame and a strong arm, Nelson threw for 35 touchdowns and just 4 interceptions last fall for Los Alamitos High School. A year of learning under the nation’s top college quarterback will make sure he and the offense keep on rolling for the foreseeable future.
Zachariah Branch: Track-level speed. NFL-level catching. Branch profiles as an elite route-runner on Day One, able to leave his defenders in the dust early in the play. He also shines on special teams, recently scoring a 93-yard punt return at the Under Armour All-American game. 
Makai Lemon: Malachi Nelson will have one of his top targets back in Lemon, an intriguing two-way option. Lemon starred as a wide receiver and cornerback for Los Alamitos, displaying elite quickness on both sides of the ball. His ability to accelerate and decelerate allows him to create wide separation from defenders and close gaps in space.
4-Stars
Braylan Shelby: A much-needed reinforcement on the defensive front, Shelby checks in as the No. 8 edge rusher in the country. A late-riser, Shelby flew up recruiting rankings last fall to become USC’s 4th top-100 recruit. Shelby’s athleticism allows him to step out and be a factor in defending the passing game.
Tackett Curtis: Named Louisiana’s Mr. Football earlier this month, Curtis became the first winner of the award to choose USC since Joe McKnight, USC’s highest-ever graded recruit. He’s got big shoes to fill, but Lincoln Riley is a believer. “I think he’s the best inside linebacker in the country,” Riley said. “There’s not one I would take over him.”
Quinten Joyner: A running back out of Texas, Joyner combines strength and speed to devastating effect. Impressive marks on the 100m and shotput tell the story of an athlete who could be ready to run downhill in the Pac-12 from the start. Joyner will join a suddenly-crowded running back room and will have to excel in practice to see the field over a few returners and newcomers.
Elijah Paige: A 6’7”, 304 pound offensive tackle out of Phoenix, Arizona Page turned down Notre Dame and UCLA in favor of USC, so he should be a quick fan favorite.
Maliki Crawford: A cornerback out of Oxnard, California, Crawford is a high-upside player that could develop into one of the nation’s top defensive players in the coming years. Above-average height and length will allow him to break up passes from farther away than most corners.
A’Marion Peterson: A strong player who punches holes in defenses as a running back, Peterson turned down Alabama for the Trojans. He likes to bounce off tackles and could be part of a one-two punch of runners alongside fellow 2023 commit Quinten Joyner.
Notable Transfers
MarShawn Lloyd: Coming in from the University of South Carolina, Lloyd will serve as a physical, SEC-tested running back at the top of the depth chart. After running for 9 touchdowns last season, Lloyd will be hungry to add to his tally in the wide-open USC offense.
Dorian Singer, Kyon Barrs and Christian Roland-Wallace: A trio of Arizona standouts cross the Pac-12 to join the Trojans on both sides of the ball. Singer led the league in receiving yards last season, Rolland-Wallace will help replace the departing Mekhi Blackmon as cornerback and Barrs will add another All-Pac-12 performer to the defensive line.
Mason Cobb: He led Oklahoma State in tackles and tackles for loss and will likely be a foundational piece for the defense in the fall. Cobb had a huge game in the trenches against CFP also-rans TCU in mid-October, tallying 16 tackles.

Everyone has their own way of understanding the world. For some, it’s through conversation with peers;  for others, it’s studying a certain topic. 
For Remi Frogo, the world can be understood through art or, at least, that’s the goal of her new exhibit, “i know everything.”
In this  “exploration of self,” Frogo set out to create a show that “dissects, denies, and resurrects.” 
“The ‘i know everything’ title came from a zine that I recently made. It’s a bit of a jab at my work being kind of self-centered. A lot of my subjects are myself,” Frogo said. “[It’s] a little sarcastic — kind of revolving around me not knowing everything, wanting to know more and just kind of making fun of myself a little bit … It’s subtly funny to me.” 
Frogo, a senior majoring in fine arts, applied for a showcase last spring and was accepted in November. The installation is made up primarily of paintings that Frogo created over the past two years, often composed from her own photos. Her best friend, Ellie Williams, a senior majoring in popular music performance, witnessed the creation of her exhibit, which, in large part, is a collection of memories throughout her life. Williams first met Frogo in the pair’s junior year of high school, when they attended the Orange County School of the Arts. Since then, the two have supported each other’s growth as artists and people.
“When I met her, she was already like Picasso, already very, very talented,” Williams said. “I was already aware that she was going to be making art for a long time.” 
While Frogo experiments with various mediums, oil paint is the one that she gravitates toward the most. 
“A lot of things start with a visual idea rather than a concept,” Frogo said. “I’ve learned that as I start to paint it from this image, as I’m working on it, I’ll start to realize what it conceptually means to me, but I like to lead with the visual rather than the conceptual most of the time.”
No two artists are identical in approach to developing their work. What sets Frogo apart is her point of inspiration, which, for the most part, originates in the buried treasures of her own camera roll, featuring memories of her friends and, often, herself.
Characterized by bright colors and occasionally chaotic compositions, Frogo’s paintings are unmistakably hers. For some of her paintings, Frogo distorts and compiles her reference images into captivating compositions, creating varying points of focus. Other paintings have a more direct focus, such as the painting depicting a one hour and twenty minute phone call with her mother.  
“I learned how to paint by using other people’s references and trying to replicate other things. I got to the point where I was like ‘I don’t want to be just taking other people’s images,’ so it started at a place of ‘if it’s my own photos or if it’s myself, then it’s definitely original,’” Frogo said. “Then it led into wanting to depict myself in a certain moment in time and take a period of my own life and experience and immortalize that point in time. As it progressed, each new self- portrait I made kind of replaced the last … It feels natural now.”
After a lifetime spent refining her own artistic palette and working closely with mentor Keith Mayerson, a professor of art at Roski, Frogo was prepared to cultivate her own exhibit. 
 “I always say to be a great artist, each new work needs to be your masterpiece and you have to beat it with your next masterpiece,” Mayerson said. “Remi from the get-go has been making masterpiece after masterpiece, but when you see them together it’s an eclectic body of work where they’re all equally good and it’s just about different ideas happening in each one.”
When trying to create an introduction to her show, Frogo enlisted the help of her friend, Julia Lin, a senior majoring in journalism. 
“I’m not always super good at articulating my work and my ideas into words, so it was cool to see her take what I said and interpret it and say it back to me,” Frogo said.
Although Frogo begins the exhibit with the phrase, “I know everything, and by that I mean I know nothing,” the unknown is the appeal of her work. 
“It’s a combination of wanting to know everything and actually knowing nothing, which I think is very cool,” Williams said. “I personally resonate with that a lot.”
“i know everything” is on display at the Helen Lindhurst Fine Arts Gallery in Watt Hall from Jan. 12 to 25.

Growing up as a Latina with pale skin and red hair, my identity was always something that confused me, mostly because it confused the people around me. I’m told on a daily basis that I must be Irish because of my hair, and strangers argue when I tell them that both of my parents are in fact Mexican. After hundreds,  maybe thousands, of these interactions, the confidence I once held in knowing where I belong began to disintegrate. It instilled the idea that I was not enough of a Latina to call myself one and that I could never do the heritage justice because of how I am perceived. 
So who am I to be giving Latin music recommendations? Certainly not someone who has extensive background knowledge on the topic. I’ll even hesitantly admit I am not fluent in Spanish. I’d say I’m about 80% there, making me a full-fledged “no sabo” kid. 
However, for the last few years I have had the joy of discovering Spanish music, and I can appreciate the Latin music being released today. 
If you’re anything like me and your only exposure to Latin music was the Luis Miguel played in the car on the way to school, or if you’re just looking for recommendations as you discover a new genre, welcome. I invite you to put your headphones on and come on this journey through new Latin music as we discover artists together throughout the semester. 
If you are one of the millions of people who relentlessly listened to Bad Bunny’s “Un Verano Sin Ti” last year, here is another artist you might enjoy. With the same urban trap style as Bad Bunny, María Becerra is quickly becoming one of Argentina’s most celebrated singers. Becerra has countless collaborations under her belt with notable Latin artists such as Prince Royce and J Balvin, as well as the new album “LA NENA DE ARGENTINA,” released Dec. 8. 
The question of “who is María Becerra?” is one that even she may struggle to answer. There is no one identity that explains Becerra, but rather a multiplicity of personas. Becerra can be quiet, even unassertive, yet when she performs or creates art — Becerra unleashes a buried side — one which is powerful, which unapologetically feels every emotion in its greatest capacity. Her music, or rather her creative process, is what evokes this separate identity. This persona is what she named her most recent album after — “LA NENA DE ARGENTINA.”
“La Nena,” which translates to “the girl,” is a fitting title for Becerra’s latest release as it is in equal parts an appreciation of her heritage and an evolution of her Latina identity.
Only 22 years old, la nena de Buenos Aires is making a name for herself. While her signature subject matter and tone of voice makes her music easily recognizable, the person behind the sound is harder to identify. 
“I believe I have two personalities,” she said in an interview with MTV. “One is the more timid María who’s introverted, dramatic, and with her emotions on her sleeve. The other personality is the María who’s more fierce, more extroverted, and says and sings about things that are taboo. She stands strong. Making music brought out this side of me that I didn’t know, and it surprised me what I can do.”
The album consists of 12 songs, ranging in styles of cumbia, bachata and everything in between. 
In an interview with Spotify, Becerra explained that the titular final track concerns her alter ego.
“The girl from Argentina, my artistic facet. She’s a powerful girl, that achieves everything that is proposed and never goes unnoticed,” Becerra said. “ I love my country and I want everyone to know that I’m Argentina!”
Becerra’s music usually falls within the lines of reggaeton, but her most recent album showed that she is not afraid to experiment with new sounds. My favorite song, “ADIÓS,” is the first cumbia song Becerra has released. For anyone reading the word Cumbia for the first time, it is a style of Latin music and dance that originated in Colombia but has variations across Latin America specific to different countries. 
Despite an upbeat tempo, “ADIÓS” delves into the pain of acknowledging the toxicity of a relationship and accepting that at times the only way to move forward is to say goodbye. The juxtaposition between its cheerful melody and melancholy lyrics makes the song dynamic. 
“To your deceptions and your lies I say goodbye / There is no more harm, no more wounds with me / From your falsehood and your hypocrisy and I am tired / Not for a second will I return to your double life,” Becerra sings. 
Her songs are written from real experiences, either her own or those of her friends. That candidness is tangible throughout the album’s lyrics, which touch on rather taboo topics, carrying the impact of her album far beyond just background music in the car or at a party. 
Alexis Lara is a sophomore writing about Latin music. She is also an arts & entertainment editor at the Daily Trojan.

The beleaguered cryptocurrency industry has faced severe scrutiny from policymakers and regulators following a series of high-profile insolvencies.
Most notably, crypto exchange FTX — a broker-like service that provided a platform on which customers could buy and sell cryptocurrency, and that was once worth $32 billion — listed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in November amid a flurry of financial fraud filings against its founder, Sam Bankman-Fried. Bankman-Fried was arrested in the Bahamas Dec. 12 on charges of wire fraud, conspiracy to commit money laundering and conspiracy to misuse customer funds, and has agreed to be extradited to the United States.
Following the FTX fallout, the bank Silvergate Capital saw its shares tank by over 40% last week after fourth-quarter results showed massive customer withdrawals. Silvergate, once earmarked as an essential service in the crypto market and endorsed by Bankman-Fried, is a bank that offers traditional financial services and a payment network to crypto companies, including exchanges such as FTX. Silvergate has faced calls for answers from policy figures, including, Senator Elizabeth Warren as allegations of its instrumental role in defrauding FTX customers have come to light.
Michael Simkovic, the Leon Benwell professor of law and accounting at the Gould School of Law, spoke with the Daily Trojan to discuss the risk inherent to the cryptocurrency industry and whether companies should be given the protection of government guarantees. Silvergate offers U.S. dollar-denominated loans and takes relatively risky cryptocurrency as collateral, and Simkovic said its recent losses could come out of government entities’ pockets and increase costs to the broader financial system. He also postulates that cryptocurrency could end up hurting those who have not invested in cryptocurrency themselves.
Simkovic placed a lens on the role of government in allowing the problems with banks like Silvergate that place large bets on cryptocurrency to become larger. He said that such companies should not be given government guarantees, and that “the traditional financial system would perhaps be better served by excluding those sorts of companies from [being] within the protection of government guarantees.”
Simkovic highlighted the important role of government guarantees to the financial system, describing how guarantees from entities like the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (that backs Silvergate) and the Treasury mean that banks are able to tell their depositors that their money is safe.
“The deal is … if anything bad happens to us, [the government entities will] make sure that you do not lose a dime and you will be fine,” Simkovic said. “That makes people trust banks and feel comfortable leaving their money with the banks even at a relatively low interest rate.” 
“The problem,” Simkovic said, “is if they start taking too much risk that raises costs to the government to make good on those guarantees, and the regulations are typically in place to limit how much risk the banks can take since they do have those guarantees. It’s unclear whether it is advisable to allow banks to be placing large bets on cryptocurrency. It’s extremely risky. It’s very speculative.”
While venture capitalists have the right to invest in cryptocurrencies, Simkovic said that government backed entities are, by nature, supposed to be more conservative.
Since the inception of Bitcoin as the first cryptocurrency in 2009, more than 21,000 different cryptocurrencies have been created, totalling to a value of around $804 billion. Around 21% of American adults are said to have owned cryptocurrency as of last year, and banks like J.P. Morgan have started their own cryptocurrency. Even countries have begun to accept it as legal tender. However, Simkovic said he doubted cryptocurrency will go on to play a large role in the financial system. 
“I’ve heard many of the arguments in favor of cryptocurrency,” he said. “[For] pretty much every argument I’ve heard, the existing financial system can do what cryptocurrency is supposed to do, and often … [they] can do it better.”
Cryptocurrency also facilitates illegal and criminal transactions, Simkovic said, including “tax avoidance, regulatory avoidance, money laundering, terrorism” and “illegal transactions involving drugs.” 
“If you are doing something which is completely legal and you make a transaction through a traditional financial institution, your financial institution knows what you’re doing,” Simkovic said. “But that information is not directly transmitted to the government — it’s only transmitted if you come under investigation.”
The impact goes well beyond the safety of American citizens, Simkovic said. 
“Even if Silvergate’s customers are not U.S. citizens, its activities still affect the U.S. financial system and ultimately could affect U.S. taxpayers,” Simkovic said.

The XBB.1.5 coronavirus subvariant, nicknamed the “Kraken” variant, has some USC students concerned that it may spread because of the lax attitudes and health practices of their peers. 
XBB.1.5 is a descendant of the omicron XBB subvariant. It is a combination of two previous BA.2 subvariants, both of which were more transmissible than previous variants. Now, it appears that XBB.1.5 has the potential to be even more transmissible. Surfacing in early November 2022, XBB.1.5 accounts for nearly 30% of coronavirus variants circulating in the United States in the past week, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. 
The variant ravaged the East Coast over Winter Break. Right now, XBB.1.5 makes up 72.7% of coronavirus cases in New Jersey, New York, Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands, according to the CDC. XBB.1.5 recently made landfall in Southern California.
In an interview with the Los Angeles Times, Paula Cannon, virologist and professor of molecular microbiology and immunology at USC, said XBB1.5 is a new monster altogether, one that has evolved to be even more transmissible than its predecessors.  
“It’s just the latest and greatest most infectious variant,” Cannon said. “It’s amazing to me that this virus keeps finding one more trick to make itself even more infectious, even more transmissible.”
Spring semester attitudes, peer pressure and a lack of mask-wearing are among the reasons some students said they are concerned about the XBB.1.5 subvariant.
Ailani Bonilla, a sophomore majoring in geological sciences, said she feels worried about the subvariant, given her immunocompromised status and high risk for long-term complications from the coronavirus. 
“I’m a high-risk person. I’ve already gotten [the coronavirus] twice, and it really sucked. I had the omicron variant. I have a lot of high-risk family members, and I go home a lot so I don’t want to give it to them,” Bonilla said. “No one really follows the CDC guidelines anymore.”
L.A County recommends wearing a mask during this winter surge, especially in indoor public settings, businesses, government offices, schools and higher education settings. L.A. County health officials urge people to wear a mask for ten days as they return to school and work.
Kevin Grammling, a sophomore majoring in theater, said he felt that the fear that once kept everyone masked and socially distanced no longer exists, and that many are ignoring health recommendations from public officials. 
The freshness of the pandemic in 2020 and the news of impending illness spurred people into action, Grammling said, but people have now grown too comfortable. 
“When we bring up [coronavirus], it doesn’t have that same air of catastrophe and tragedy and fear,” Grammling said. “It feels way more normalized and, with that, there’s a level of comfort and although it’s less anxiety-inducing … A lot of people are very quick to get comfortable and feel safe again, and with safety we fall back into our old routines of not wearing a mask and everything.”
At the end of 2021 and beginning of 2022, USC required students to test every week and show their Trojan Checks, a pass obtained after a daily health check quiz. The University has since lifted its coronavirus protocols, no longer requiring weekly surveillance testing and ending its campuswide mask mandate in March.
Santana Vespe, a sophomore majoring in comparative literature and journalism, said that because of the break, many people were bored from staying at home and now are back on campus and anxious to experience college again, making them less likely to wear masks and test frequently.
“There’s that spring semester nihilism that comes over the student body and maybe even the professors,” Vespe said. “It’s like, ‘I don’t care I was just at home for a bunch of weeks and that was dead boring’ or ‘The new year happened, it didn’t change anything, whatever, I’m just going to continue that downward spiral.’”
Now that classes have started, Bonilla said she has noticed a steady trend of people not wearing face masks.
“Even when USC [removed the mask mandate], I still saw a lot of people wearing masks compared to people who weren’t wearing masks,” Bonilla said. “As more people started unmasking, it just became ‘Oh go back to how things were’ and people became less empathetic … Yeah, you should think about yourself, you should be happy, but … sometimes you have to make a sacrifice to take care of others.”

USC admits new students in the spring semester every year to provide opportunities for qualified students who were unable to enroll earlier because of insufficient university resources or space in the fall. This year, the University reported that it welcomed 813 new undergraduate students to campus, constituting 19% of the total number of 2022-23 student starts. 
Of the 19%, 25% are first-generation college students, 56% are from California and 12% are international students.
Although students who start in January are just now beginning their careers at USC, many spring admits are coming from a fulfilling fall semester of taking for-credit courses at a community college, studying at local universities or even enrolling in one of the University’s study abroad programs. 
Despite having had these fruitful experiences in the fall, finding a community is still difficult, said James Lee, a freshman majoring in business administration who started at USC this semester. 
“It’s definitely harder to make friends,” Lee said. “Other kids have more experience … and, in a way, you’re disadvantaged when you join clubs or you’re just trying to go out. It’s a lot more difficult, but, I mean, I just take it at face value. I’m blessed with what I have.”
All spring admits who spoke with the Daily Trojan said they were given fewer opportunities to network, socialize and adjust to campus compared to those who start in the fall. Heeding this, the University has made some efforts to help new admits get involved by hosting spring events — like Welcome Week orientation and Spring Into SC for spring students and Late Night LA in McCarthy Quad for the entire student body.
“The orientation program offerings for this year’s spring admitted students mirrored the options available for fall admitted students,” wrote Dean of Admissions Timothy Brunold in a statement to the Daily Trojan Thursday. “Both populations received online academic advisement and course registration, paired with in-person events before the start of classes.”
Megan Chan, a freshman spring admit majoring in communications, said there were several events she has attended so far to get academically and socially involved around campus — including an orientation for the Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism, Spring Into SC, the convocation and a Spider-Man movie night.
Many of these events, however, are restricted to spring admits, making it challenging for them to get to know more fall admits and diversify their relationships. Leena Elmashat, a freshman spring admit majoring in computer science, said that most of her interactions so far have been with fellow spring admits. 
“I’ve been able to talk to a few fall admits, but it’s definitely been more spring admits,” Elmashat said. “For example, in my GESM, there’s a lot of spring admits, … so I have more exposure to spring admits in my different classes just because of how my schedule ended up being set up.”
Some students have also had questions regarding whether certain majors are prioritized for spring admission over others. 
“I’ve seen a lot of film majors or theater majors that are in spring for some reason,” said Celeste Leendertse, a freshman Spring Admit majoring in economics. “That was a little weird, especially theater majors, because I know that there aren’t that many of them in the program.” 
Brunold wrote in his statement Thursday that spring admission offers “vary from year to year but tend to be proportional to the size of each academic unit,” and that “not all majors are conducive to students entering mid-year, but most are.”
Some spring admits also said that their housing assignments, which are usually any available space in undergraduate apartments, do little to help the situation. Leendertse, who lives at University Gateway, said she felt as though she was missing out living away from her peers.
“It’s less social here than some of the other freshman halls … I was a little disappointed,” she said. “I definitely missed out a little bit on meeting other freshmen.”
While the University’s orientation left spring admits well-prepared to make use of available resources, Elmashat said it failed to help them fully adjust to the social factor of campus life. 
“[Fall admits] had a lot more get to know you games and things like that at [their] orientation,” Elmashat said, whereas the online spring orientation was far less interactive, covering information about resources and inviting guests to speak about their experiences.
Despite some of these pitfalls, Lee said he has been enjoying his time at the University so far. 
“I’ve already made a really good group of friends and I’ve met so many great people even through like small events,” Lee said. “I’m happy with my experience.”

The USC men’s basketball team suffered a heartbreaking 60-58 loss to the crosstown rival UCLA Bruins last Thursday, but the Trojans redeemed themselves on Thursday with a 68-61 win against the Colorado Buffaloes. USC will look to stay in the win column Saturday night against the Utah Utes.
Head Coach Andy Enfield said how the team’s long week of practice has helped with improving its game on both sides of the floor.
“It allowed us to improve on the offensive end, work on some of the things that we didn’t do so well against UCLA … It also gives us time to go over our defense,” Enfield said in an interview with the Daily Trojan.
The Trojans were down big against UCLA, with the largest deficit being 18 points. With bench contribution from sophomore guard Reese Dixon-Waters shooting a perfect 7-for-7 from the field with 16 points. Though the Trojans took the lead with less than a minute to go. They eventually fell from a game-winning three from UCLA junior guard Jaylen Clark.
“Our guys came out and really competed and had a chance to win the game and play outstanding defense the entire second half with toughness,” Enfield said. “It was nice to see [Dixon-Waters] be aggressive and make the right decisions and make some shots against UCLA.”
The Utah Utes are 12-5 on the season with an impressive 5-1 conference record, good for 2nd in the Pac-12. Their 7 foot senior center, Branden Carlson, has been a major force on the offensive end and protecting the rim, leading the team in points, rebounds and assists, averaging 15.7 points per game, 7.4 rebounds per game and 2.2 blocks per game. 
The Trojans have won five of the last seven matchups against the Utes. To prepare for this Thursday’s, game senior guard Boogie Ellis stressed just locking in on the game plan.
On the defensive end, USC has been one of the top teams in the country, holding opponents to 38% from the field, good for 13th in the country. Ellis credits this success to being active on the floor.
“Flying around, staying in the gaps, communicating and having pride in stopping our defenders,” said Ellis in an interview with the Daily Trojan.
USC played at the Galen Center Thursday for the first time since their 74-71 victory against Auburn Dec. 18. The Trojans haven’t started their conference schedule with four games on the road since 1967. Playing in front of Trojan fans seems key for their success, as they are 8-1 in home games this year. 
“It feels good, honestly, Ellis said. I really didn’t notice it though because I like playing road games but I’m glad to be back at home.”
Ellis is leading the Trojans this season in points, averaging a career-high 15.7 points per game and a career-high in steals of 1.5. Last season, USC swept the season series against Utah, beating the Utes 79-67 on the road and 93-73 at home. Ellis shot a combined 11-for-21 from the field while scoring 37 points in both those games. 
Ellis loves the scrappiness and how they’re never out of a game because of their toughness.
“Our grit, we never give up no matter what, said Ellis.” We stay together taking everything into consideration. No matter what, if we’re down, we’ll have a chance to win the game.”
USC looks to keep its winning ways going against Utah  Saturday at the Galen Center at 7:30 p.m.

I didn’t particularly want to watch “Puss in Boots: The Last Wish” when my friends texted me about our Sunday night plans on the eve of my final semester at USC. I don’t know if it was because I thought I was above the “Shrek” franchise, considering the 21-and-a-half years of wisdom and maturity I have accrued while attending this university, but I would have rather watched “Sunday Night Football” or gone to Dave and Buster’s (or watched “Sunday Night Football” at Dave and Buster’s) instead of viewing the second installment in the “Puss in Boots” saga.
Consider my mind changed. More than anything, I laughed — particularly at whatever “Big” Jack Horner, voiced by comedian John Mulaney, had to say. The movie also, perhaps unsurprisingly, provided opportunities to reflect on the overwhelmingly broad concept of life and its limitations. 
But first, the jokes. Horner, one of the villains in the flick, was a man-child in every sense. Without getting too political, his appearance and characteristics scream Washington and the antagonist might as well be gracing the White House or Senate floor. He looks ridiculous and is unabashedly evil but, because of his inherited wealth and arsenal of magic toys — ranging from the magic carpet from “Aladdin” (1992) to King Arthur’s Excalibur — Horner poses a major threat to a dejected Puss, who competes with a host of fairy tale favorites to find the Wishing Star. 
The Wishing Star is what it sounds like: a hidden star that grants one wish to whoever runs through the gauntlet of traps and tricks that precede its discovery.
For Puss, finding the Wishing Star is a matter of life and death. After running out of his first eight lives, Puss becomes entranced with the idea of using the Wishing Star to wish for a fresh set of nine (which begs the question, “Why stop at nine, Puss?”). The celebrated outlaw no longer has the freedom to risk death at every turn, made evident by his chilling encounter with a ferocious bounty hunter who intimidates Puss so much that he does something he had never done before: run away from a fight.
On the quest for a life-refill, Puss encounters new friends and familiar faces. One, a nameless dog who immediately clings to Puss, pulls out a softer side of the habitually tough tomcat. The other, a former fiancée of Puss’ named Kitty Softpaws, serves as a powerful reminder of the past and everything that makes life worth living.
No matter what good befalls Puss and his friends, though, the cat is constantly in terror that the bounty hunter, a large hooded wolf with red eyes and unknown magical powers, will catch up to him. Death, as we know, comes for us all in the end.
I won’t necessarily equate dying with graduating from this university … but I will try. Having started my last semester at USC, I could relate to Puss’ anxiety as he faced his ninth and final life. I would probably use the Wishing Star to find a job (or wish for more wishes) instead of extending my lifespan ninefold, but the ability to wish for anything I want would be tempting enough to  launch me on a dangerous quest full of unknowns as well. Which I suppose is what life is, anyway. There, I tried.
A welcome addition to the cast and a comforting presence to those experiencing quarter-life crises is the beloved Jiminy Cricket of “Pinocchio” (1940) fame, serving as Horner’s conscience (or, at least, trying to). Throughout the film, Horner’s savagery and dismissal of human life is present and horrifies the poor cricket. 
Horner’s crew of pie-makers (dubbed the “Baker’s Dozen”) disappears faster than cornbread at the Warren family dinner table, but Horner pays their sacrifice no mind. At one point, Jiminy tells the abnormally large, but small-headed Horner that he is an “irredeemable monster,” before giving up on guiding the tyrannical pie CEO. Which is an important lesson in itself: Not everyone deserves second or third or fourth chances.
Puss, on the other hand, ends up reversing some of his actions that hurt those he cared about. While he’s focused on his own life for the majority of the movie, he realizes some of his past misfires and shows some accountability and remorse for hurting his loved ones — a trait that seems to escape many these days.
“Puss in Boots: The Last Wish” is fun for kids (I would imagine; I am not one anymore) as well as super mature and sophisticated 21-year-olds. It will make you ponder over what you want to do with your only remaining life just as much as it’ll make you laugh obnoxiously loud — although that might have just been the weed.

“Just come here legally.” Many immigrants hear this phrase far too often. The use of the term “illegal” in the subject of immigration tends to connect immigration to legality, with a specific focus on racialization and migration. What this phrase insinuates is that immigration is a simple process that anyone can do, but when you’re trapped in war zones with little to no resources, it feels more like a Sisyphean task.
As Haitians flee from humanitarian crises and citizens of Latin American countries take on the journey north, the border and all the political baggage it carries only reminds them of the hatred the United States carries for people like them. The media often refers to migration as a wave and amplifies calls for a focus on border enforcement and a wall to build. The conception evoked is that immigration is an invasion, which is far from the truth. 
Through the immigration journey, parents carry their children with them. Many would move mountains for their children to have a better life; more exactly, they would cross mountains to move to an entirely new country. These children, sometimes mere infants, are often unaware of where they are moving; unaware that they may grow up to a life filled with the question of “where are you from?”, unaware of the lack of protection, unwarranted hostility and unjust treatment within they may face in education, work and the legal system. 
Sadly, a common response to the struggles of many undocumented immigrants is to “just come legally.” Indeed, the statement serves as proof that those who say it possess little knowledge of the U.S.’s citizenship process. It can take up to ten years to obtain a green card, years which are not guaranteed as many continue to struggle to survive in their host countries. 
As an undocumented person, I have always felt as though I had to hide in the shadows of the U.S., due to a lack of support. As children arrive in the U.S., we do not hold citizenship nor the benefits granted to citizens. However, we were raised in the U.S. and, being in the country, we have an excellent knowledge of it — the history, culture and language — only to not be recognized as Americans no matter how hard we try. 
In 2012, there was a spark of hope as the Department of Homeland Security announced Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals. This executive order authorized immigrant children and people aged 16-30 federal protection, work permits and a temporary social security number. However, this order did not grant a direct pathway to citizenship. 
Even the order’s announcement has sparked conversation: is DACA constitutional? Former President Donald Trump announced in 2017 his plans to end the DACA program, causing fear in applicants and those who were currently in the program. “Congress, get ready to do your job — DACA!” read his tweet. 
On June 18, 2020, the Trump administration moved to terminate the DACA program, a decision that overruled by the Supreme Court; the Justices ruled 5-4 in favor of DREAMers. The ruling allowed U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services to accept DACA applicants for both previous and new recipients, as the pause in applications due to the Trump administration’s attempts to permanently end the program affected the status of many in the country.
On Oct. 5, 2022, the Fifth Circuit Court declared the DACA program unconstitutional. Judge Andrew Hanen from the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Texas claimed in his 2021 ruling that “Texas [sought] to protect its legal residents’ economic and commercial interests from labor market distortion caused by DACA.” 
The truth? A PBS news brief by Courtney Vinopal looked into figures from the New American Economy that show that DACA recipients paid $4 billion in taxes to the U.S. government in 2017. The Director of Quantitative Research at the New American Economy Andrew Lim went on to state that “the vast majority of [the DACA-eligible individuals] — 93% — are working, if they’re not in school. Together, every year, they earn more than $23.4 billion.” Billions would be lost if DACA were to end, and the labor market could implode all together.
A nine-digit security measure holds us back, and we are tired. We are tired of proving that we are humans. Yet, it feels as though how we got into the country is the only thing many focus on. Our only chance? Applying for citizenship through a long, tedious process, only to be tested on six U.S.  history questions that determine whether or not we truly “belong” in this country. 
As of 2023, current DACA recipients and youth migrants are unsure of whether DACA will remain. Universities, colleges and high schools need to be aware that undocumented students need support from teachers and the reassurance that no dream shall remain a dream, but become a reality. 
Immigrants are people. We are not aliens or “illegal”. We are those who do not have the great privilege of being born with wealth and safety, something completely out of our control. Undocumented students have ambition. We work twice as much just for institutions to deny us support. We are tired of sharing the good we have contributed to this country just to convince people we are human. We want recognition; why does this country fail to hear us?

There’s a movie I want to watch with my mom. It came out early last year, 2022. It’s called “Everything Everywhere All at Once.” On second thought, I think she’d hate it. The main characters are all Chinese. There are moments when they speak to each other in Chinese as well. And she would definitely disapprove of the daughter. She’s rebellious. She talks back, has tattoos and is gay.
She’s just like me.
But my mom doesn’t know that. She thinks I’m her smart, hardworking son who will go to college and get a degree, get a well paying job and let her finally retire. And she thinks that all her efforts paid off. That she raised me well and her sacrifice – immigrating to the United States – was well worth it. And one day, I’ll give her many grandchildren to call her own. But I won’t. I’m not. I’m not who she thinks I am. But she doesn’t know that. I’m sorry I’ve kept it a secret for so long. And I’m sorry that I will continue to keep it, because I’m not sure if she would ever accept me after finding out. I’m not sure if she could still call me her son. If she could still love me as your son. Because in this house, we don’t say “I love you.”
In October 2020, I adopted an orange cat, a silly little boy named Leo. He taught me unconditional love. That little asshole has bitten and scratched me, covering me in cuts and scars, but how could I be mad at him? In his tiny single little brain cell, all he wants to do is play. And so he plays with sharp teeth and equally sharp claws. And I could never be mad at him for that. Because he does not understand what it is to hurt others – the way you, me and everyone else does. Because that’s what people do. We hurt each other.
Love hurts. I’ve spent much of my life believing my parents didn’t love me. You know, during the pandemic, I took the year off from school. I was home with my mom, dad and sister. Every. Single. Day. And, God, did it drive me insane. But in that broken little home, we learned (or rather relearned) how to love, and it was the silly orange kitty that taught us.
My parents were not happy when I brought Leo home — but it was too late. I paid for all his vet bills and his supplies. So they let me keep him, and before I knew it, Leo was no longer mine, but my family’s. My mom, who did not love me, showed so much affection to Mr. Leo. Mr. Leo who would sleep beside her every night. She tells me that Leo is my older brother, reincarnated from when she miscarried before me. My dad kisses Leo on his silly little head every morning before heading off to work. My absent dad, who never once showed me an ounce of affection.
And it’s not fair.
Why was it that my parents, who never loved me, showed so much love and affection to my cat? I guess it’s because people change. It’s gradual, but they change. And the way they show love changes as well. In the years since I’ve left home, I learned that love is so much more than uttering the words “I love you.” Love is in everything we do. And it looks different for everyone.
When I was a child, love was parental neglect. My parents were never home because they loved me. They never spent time with me because they loved me. Because they were too busy living paycheck-to-paycheck, too busy trying to keep food on the plate and a roof above my head, to tell me they love me. So in my house, we don’t say “I love you.” My mom says “I love you” when she cuts fruit for me while I study. She says it in the cuts on her hands. My dad says “I love you” in the silence when he drives me to school in the mornings. For 12 years, he had been saying “          .”  
My parents said “I love you” with clenched fists and raised hands because my parents did not know better. Because no one told them that violence would only breed resentment and fear. But that’s what they were taught. So in the only way they knew how, they said “I love you.” Again. And again. And again. Until blood had been spilt and tears had been shed. And I was too young, too naive to know it then. 
I can’t say I forgive my parents for what they’ve done. They’ve given me a lifetime of mommy and daddy issues. But I’m trying. I want to. Because they did the best with what they knew, with what they’ve been taught. So “I love you” is violence and discipline. It is pain and suffering, backed with good intentions. So in my household, we don’t say “I love you.” Because it hurts too much to say it.
So don’t say “I love you.”
