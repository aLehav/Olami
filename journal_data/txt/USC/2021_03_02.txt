Jai Bhavnani was in the shower when he had the idea to build a cryptocurrency investment company. He wanted people to be able to compound their wealth, so with a vision in mind for a start-up, he was inspired to create Rari Capital.
Rari Capital is a start-up that allows users to lend their cryptocurrencies to the company and then receive the highest yield back for their assets without having to go to a bank. Co-founded by Bhavnani, a freshman in the Iovine and Young Academy, UW-Madison sophomore Jack Lipstone and UT Austin sophomore David Lucid, the idea for the company was first developed in late May of 2020 and launched in July 2020.
In simple finance terms, a cryptocurrency is a currency on a blockchain. It’s a type of digital currency where users can use an online platform, one example being the application Coinbase, to turn their USD into USDC (digital dollars), and deposit it to start receiving earnings off of it. It is similar to lending cash to a bank and earning interest off of it.
“At its core, how you differentiate a cryptocurrency from a non-cryptocurrency is whether it is living on top of a blockchain,” Bhavani said.
Before Rari Capital, Bhavnani and Lipstone developed a cryptocurrency mobile wallet called Ambo. Once Ambo was acquired by MyCrypto, another crypto wallet manager company that both founders worked for in 2019, they had a large amount of U.S. dollar-based cryptocurrencies. 
Bhavnani wanted to get more money off his cryptos, so he manually lent it out to financial platforms like Dydx and Compound finance. Eventually, he wanted to speed up this process so he could generate more cryptos.
To deposit into Rari Capital, users must connect a crypto mobile wallet (MetaMask, WalletConnect, Portis, Torus, Formatic or Authereum) to access the Rari Capital app landing page. They then choose one of three pools (the Rari ETH Pool Token, Rari Stable Pool Token or Rari Yield Pool Token) to deposit their cryptos in. As users deposit their money into Rari’s pools, their money will go out to providers. Rari takes 17.5% of everything they make off their users as a performance fee cost, Bhavnani said.
As Rari Capital moves into the economic world with nearly 10,000 token holders, they are constantly updating what their company has to offer. 
In July, version one was launched, and users deposited a maximum of $350. One hundred seventy users deposited and summed the fund to up to $60,000. Since version one worked, Rari Capital was something the co-founders wanted to continue building, Bhavnani said.
Version two was then released last October, when the co-founders decided to create their own cryptocurrency.
 “The cryptocurrency that we’re going to create is going to control this entire network that we’re building, this entire fund that we’re building,” Bhavnani said. “Alongside that, we started giving away our cryptocurrency to anybody that’s deposited into the fund … everybody wanted to deposit into the fund because they wanted a piece of our cryptocurrency … within 72 hours of us launching version two, we had $95 million under management.” 
Currently, the Rari Capital team is composed of eight members: the three co-founders, a user experience designer, one front-end developer, one community outreach employee and two smart contract developers. The majority of the workers attended the same high school as Bhavnani and Lipstone.
Since the start-up was formed when everything shifted online, Rari Capital has never existed in a non-Zoom world, so many of the workers have not met each other, Bhavnani said.
Justin Yu, a high school senior and the company’s first hire, said working for Rari Capital is a blessing. The experience of working for an online start-up allows him to try out a wide array of roles such as user interface, user experience design, designing operations and marketing, he said. 
 “We’ve done about three all-nighters where we cram away working on something for an important deadline,” Yu said.
The team communicates through Slack, and Lipstone said the co-founders are constantly calling each other and texting one another. 
“It’s pretty much like a family, that’s what I would call it,” Lipstone said.
The company started with an idea that has grown over the past eight months. Rari Capital’s next steps include developing a product called Fuse. Fuse will allow users to create their own money market, which would allow people to lend and borrow assets at their discretion, said Lipstone.
“I’ve been around effectively as long as the company has been around … We had nothing …  There was a bit of a stall trying to get traction, trying to get our name out there,” Yu said. “Now, there’s all sorts of influencers and larger personalities and [people on] Twitter who have thousands and thousands of followers who are tweeting about us, asking for personal pitches and more information, and I think that definitely makes it a much more rewarding experience having seen it from zero to 100.”

Julia Orozco was first introduced to the idea of sustainability with the rise of metal straws in 2016. However, Orozco quickly realized that to make a greater impact, larger institutions needed to make a change. As a result, Orozco joined the Environmental Student Assembly in Fall 2019 to meet people who were also passionate about sustainability and improving sustainability efforts at USC specifically.
”We’re only here for four years, whereas the community we’re in has been staying the same,” Orozco said. “We tend to be [more] affluent than the surrounding community, so we need to take more steps to reduce our environmental impact given that those around us don’t have necessarily have the same resources, and people of color and lower income communities tend to experience more environmental impact than than their higher income and white counterparts.”
Orozco quickly identified a major problem on campus: fraternity parties and gatherings generated a lot of waste, and a lot of the easily recyclable items being thrown away ended up in landfills. Since then, Orozco, a senior majoring in public policy and ESA director of advocacy, has worked on and off to help implement recycling measures in fraternity houses on The Row, by providing flyers and helping them set up recycling bins. 
“Greek life is such an important part of USC’s culture, and a lot of what our administration does sort of caters a lot to it, or to students in Greek life,” Orozco said. “I think that these fraternities sending the message to the administration by recycling really puts pressure on the administration to incorporate sustainability campuswide, whether it be more recycling bins on campus, or compost on campus. By showing them that students, especially those of such organizations on campus, want to become more green really pushes them to also become more green.”
Orozco originally began the project in Fall 2019 alongside Isabella Caltabiano, who graduated in 2020. Since sorority houses had already implemented recycling measures, Orozco and Caltabiano focused on introducing similar measures to fraternity houses. Later that semester, Sigma Chi became the first fraternity to implement recycling measures. However, Orozco said that because the project started in the middle of the fall semester, a lot of fraternities had already finalized their semester budgets, and it was not financially viable for them to buy the recycling bins needed at that time.
The following semester, Orozco and Caltabiano attempted to revamp the recycling initiative, before the coronavirus pandemic put their plans on hold again. 
Despite Caltabiano’s graduation that spring, Orozco still knew she wanted to make her project a reality. However, due to the continued virtual learning environment, Orozco was unable to make any additional progress throughout the Fall 2020 semester either. 
“I was hoping to pick the project back up in the fall because we were intending on being in person,” Orozco said. “But since we went fully online again with no chance of us going back in person, we halted it, since we didn’t think anyone would be on campus, so it wouldn’t be worthwhile to start the initiative again.”
However, when more people returned to campus this spring semester and the University announced its plans to reopen completely for the Fall 2021 semester, Orozco saw the perfect opportunity to start up the project once again. In January, Orozco reached out to Interfraternity Council Vice President Nolan Mac Ban to help her develop a list of fraternity contacts and ensure the project could effectively restart. 
“I was like, ‘Yeah, I’d be more than happy to help you restart this initiative and provide you with the contacts of presidents, treasurers and vice presidents of each of the houses,’” said Mac Ban, a junior majoring in business administration and cinematic arts. 
Since then, Orozco helped Delta Tau Delta, Phi Sigma Kappa, Pi Kappa Alpha and Sigma Alpha Mu implement recycling measures at each of their houses. 
Delta Tau Delta President Camilo Daza Manga first heard about the initiative from Caltabiano when it originally started in 2019.
“I wasn’t in a leadership position in my house yet at the time, but I do remember [Caltabiano] starting, then reaching out to a couple of houses,” Daza Manga said. “When Julia reached out to me earlier in January I was like, ‘Yeah, totally.’ I mean, it’s just a handful of recycling bins.  We already have gardens, cleaning services and all that type of stuff, so it was an easy transition.”
The Delta Tau Delta house has been recycling for about three weeks, with recycling bins on two of the house’s three floors. Daza Manga said that Orozco helped the fraternity get a laminated sign from the City of LA that shows exactly what can and can’t be recycled. 
Daza Manga said there have not been any difficulties adapting to the new recycling initiatives. The members have been putting food scraps in the bins and those living in the house have easily been able to recycle cans, bottles, Amazon packages and other recyclable materials. 
“I think it’s important for everybody, not just organizations [to recycle]. I think it’s a top-to-bottom thing, like big corporations doing all that type of stuff as well,” Daza Manga said. “But I feel putting our best foot forward not only, I guess, represents us in a good light but just makes us feel a little bit better about kind of contributing towards things. I think it’s something that was a little bit past due for us.”
Phi Sigma Kappa President Frank Yokas also worked with Orozco to implement the recycling initiative in his fraternity house. 
“It’s been awesome. There’s definitely less trash around the property which is always a good thing,” Yokas said. “It’s a lot cleaner. We’ve paired the recycling bin with the trash bins. So, you obviously have that option every time you walk up to a bin.” 
Yokas said that because of the house’s location, there is a lot of foot traffic around the house, and that many people experiencing homelessness look for cans to recycle in the house’s dumpster. Since the house began recycling, giving the cans away became easier. 
According to ESA Executive Director Jackson FitzGerald, one of ESA’s focuses is to advocate sustainability to all students, and focusing on a group with a high concentration of students, such as Greek life is a good way to build on the sustainability efforts that have already been made within residence halls. 
In Spring 2020, ESA implemented waste reducing initiatives throughout University housing, adding composting to several residential buildings, including Webb Tower, New North Residential College and Nemirovsky Residential College. To celebrate this, the Undergraduate Student Government held a Zero Waste Carnival in February 2020, in partnership with ESA and the USC Residential Housing Association. 
“[It’s awesome] that Julia was able to push us through during the pandemic because I know that especially for us and some of the other groups doing advocacy on campus, that getting anything done over the past few months has been really hard, because it’s not like you can meet with people,” Fitzgerald said. “This is definitely one of the biggest student-led advocacy changes that we’ve seen on campus during the pandemic, and so I’m super proud of all the work that Julia has done, especially just doing it in her free time.”

The 78th annual Golden Globe awards took place Feb. 28 to honor the best in TV and film in the last year. The coronavirus pandemic had more people than ever glued to their screens as entertainment lifelines and some truly great media came out of an otherwise rough year.
Although the Globes aims to recognize the best of U.S. film and TV, the evening was clouded by the result of a recent Los Angeles Times investigation which showed that none of the Hollywood Foreign Press Association’s 87 members are Black. This was referenced throughout the evening as the hosts’ opening monologue playfully slammed the HFPA and ended the bit with a straightforward “you gotta change that.”
When Sacha Baron Cohen accepted his award for Best Comedy or Musical with “Borat Subsequent Moviefilm,” he started his speech with, “Thank you to the all-white Hollywood Foreign Press.” 
In lieu of a ballroom packed with celebrities, the event was held virtually with its nominees calling in via Zoom. Hosts Tina Fey and Amy Poehler did appear in person at the Rainbow Room in New York and the Beverly Hilton in Los Angeles, respectively. The small audiences in both audiences were made up of first responders and frontline workers as a way to honor and thank them for their service.
The ceremony kicked off with Daniel Kaluuya winning Best Supporting Actor in any motion picture for his portrayal of Black Panther Chairman Fred Hampton in “Judas and the Black Messiah.” In typical virtual event fashion, there was a mic or muting error during his acceptance speech resulting in almost 20 seconds of dead air and his speech getting cut off. However, it was fixed in time for him to proclaim “You’re doing me dirty!” He went on to thank Hampton and to say how much he gave to the role.
“Like the great Nipsey Hussle said, ‘We’re here to give until we’re empty,’ and I gave everything.” Kaluuya said.
Chloé Zhao, writer, director and editor of “Nomadland,” won big on Sunday. She is the second woman ever to win Best Director, the last being Barbra Streisand for “Yentl” 37 years ago, and the first woman of color. “Nomadland” also took home the award for Best Motion Picture – Drama. 
With the Golden Globes being seen as an early indicator of how Academy members may vote for the Oscars, Chloé Zhao may have her eye on the prestigious Best Picture and Best Director categories, both of which are notorious boys’ clubs.
The most emotional moment of the night was when Chadwick Boseman posthumously won Best Actor in a Motion Picture Drama for his performance in “Ma Rainey’s Black Bottom.” His wife, Taylor Simone Ledward, accepted the award on his behalf and gave a teary speech.
“He would say something beautiful, something inspiring, something that would amplify that little voice inside all of that tells you that you can,” Ledward said. 
Other major winners include Andra Day winning Best Actress in a Motion Picture Drama for “The United States vs Billie Holiday,” Aaron Sorkin winning Best Screenplay for “The Trial of the Chicago 7,” “Soul” winning Best Animated Motion Picture and Best Original Score and “Lee Isaac Chung’s “Minari” winning best Foreign Language Picture.
David Fincher’s “Mank” had six nominations, the most of any movie or TV series this year, yet it did not win a single award.
Jane Fonda received the Cecil B. DeMille Award, and Norman Lear became the third ever recipient of the Carol Burnett Award, both honors to celebrate their entire careers and overall contributions to the industry.
Many Black creators, women creators and artists of color got the recognition they rightfully deserve. But through all the jabs, jokes and HFPA’s empty promises to do better, addressing the racial inequality isn’t enough without correcting it. Audiences will continue to  look at the HFPA this time next year to see if any real action is taken.

When Cardi B and Megan Thee Stallion released “WAP” this past August, its upbeat tempo and catchy lyrics inspired choreographer Brian Esperson to create a TikTok dance that soon became the #WAPChallenge. Everyone from TikTok influencer Addison Rae to the comedian-musician Jack Black tried their hand at the challenge, but the music behind this dance trend quickly turned into discourse about its provocative lyrics.
Many people — mostly conservatives — took to social media to share their immense detestation of the song’s lyrics. 
California Senate Republican candidate John Bradley tweeted: “Cardi B & Megan Thee Stallion is what happens when children are raised without God and without a strong father figure. Their new “song” The #WAP (which I heard accidentally) made me want to pour holy water in my ears and I feel sorry for future girls if this is their role model!”
Similarly, unsuccessful 2020 Republican Congressional candidate Deanna Lorraine tweeted from her now-suspended account that: “Cardi B & Megan Thee Stallion just set the entire female gender back by 100 years with their disgusting & vile ‘WAP’ song.”
While the controversy seems like it happened forever ago, I believe it is an important conversation to continue having. These responses are, as a reader, the epitome of feeling “disappointed, but not surprised.” What the popularity of “WAP” made clear was that there is only space in the men’s locker room to talk about a woman’s body or sexuality. All hell breaks loose if a woman sexualizes themself but when a man does, it is dismissed because after all, “boys will be boys.”
There is such a double standard — in rap music, politics and society in general — that women face on a daily basis. Men, especially in rap music, create hypersexualized images of women with their lyrics and no one bats an eye. The lyrics in Rapper BRS Kash’s “Throat Baby” holds nothing back, describing explicitly, the many erotic fantasies he hopes his partner — who is called numerous derogatory terms — pleasures him with. GQ even praises the song as “a melodic ode to sexual desire and the things it can drive someone to do.”
In songs like “Throat Baby,” women are seen as objects meant to pleasure men. On the other hand, it is taboo for female musicians to sing about their objectification because they need to be good role models for young girls. What about male musicians though? Shouldn’t they be role models for young boys? 
Slate curated a list of “The Dirtiest Hot 100 No. 1s of All Time Before ‘WAP’” and the majority of the songs on the list are performed by men. Songs like Sir-Mix-A-Lot’s “Baby Got Back” or Jason Derulo’s “Wiggle” are celebrated as party anthems. 
Take “Watermelon Sugar” by Harry Styles, for example. Anyone who knows me knows that I am a huge Harry Styles fan, but “Watermelon Sugar” and “WAP” are essentially about the same thing. In an interview with Zane Lowe and Styles, it is hinted that the song is a sexual innuendo about “the joys of mutually appreciated oral pleasure.” Even though the lyrics are less explicit than “WAP,” when people, or should I say Twitter, found out what “Watermelon Sugar” was meant to be about, it was laughed off and viewed as cheeky.
Any time a woman chooses to embrace their sexuality, a man is quick to express his opinion. If a woman wants to talk about her sexuality, she should be able to just like men are able to. If it makes people uncomfortable, then they need to reflect on the fact that their opinions are deeply rooted in misogyny. No man, woman or child is forced to listen to sexually explicit music, so they do not have to listen if they do not want to. 
When the people who are disgusted by “WAP” listen to the song’s lyrics, they feel as though women are doing the very thing that they wanted to stop: self-objectification; — but that is simply not true. “WAP” should stand for “We Abolish Patriarchy” because what Cardi B and Megan Thee Stallion are doing is taking back power from male-dominated institutions — empowering women to choose how they wish to sexualize and sensualize their bodies.

Award-winning composer and lyricist Stephen Sondheim once said, “Art in itself is an attempt to bring order out of chaos.” So, when the coronavirus took the world stage in early 2020, the country may have gone into lockdown, but the mind of recent USC graduate Tyler Joseph Ellis definitely did not.
Having been on a “creative momentum” looking for a new outlet to channel all his theatrical energy, Ellis stumbled upon TikTok, where he was able to move on to the next stage of his journey: the virtual stage.
“My sister and I were laughing at how silly it was that I was downloading it because I was so resistant to it … but I was so bored and wanted to know what’s up,” Ellis said. 
Little did Ellis know, he would be close to 100,000 followers in only a year into his TikTok career since he started posting videos that have consistently gained popularity.
“I found my niche,” Ellis said. “If you want to be funny, start with things that you think are funny. Find your niche [because] that’s the secret to success. I can treat my theatre-loving audience how I would treat myself.” 
On his TikTok account @tylerjosephellis, Ellis introduces us to “Theatre B*tch,” a comedic portrayal of members of the theatre community who don’t get along with other members due to their big egos. Ellis’ videos often include a vast array of theatre references that he initially believed “no one was going to get.”
“It’s really affirming [because] everyone knows a ‘theatre b*tch’. It’s not just me being silly,” Ellis said. “It definitely comes from me being an unabashed theatre nerd and I wear it proudly.”
So where did Ellis’ extensive theatre knowledge come from?
When it comes to theatre, one of Ellis’s earliest influences was Julie Andrews, who he’d seen star in the movie musical classic, “The Sound of Music.” Although utterly inspired by her performance, he still felt distanced from the actual theatre scene.
Ellis made his theatrical debut in the fifth grade in his school’s musical production of “Robin Hood.” Being given the lead role for the first time was an experience he would never forget, and he definitely made the most of it. 
By high school, Ellis established himself as a “theatre kid,” something he’s now garnered fame from on TikTok. Acting has become second nature to Ellis, who puts performing at the forefront of his life. This has not limited him to the realm of theatre, but has led to one of his first television appearances on the “Late Show with David Letterman,” where he performed his award-winning call of the Pacific Loon for his high school’s annual bird calling contest. 
“I craved that nervous butterflies-in-your-stomach feeling,” Ellis said. “Like adrenaline coursing through your veins.” 
Ellis knew he didn’t want to study under a bachelor of fine arts program because on top of acting, directing, producing and marketing were also growing interests for him. Eventually, Ellis officially began his four-year journey as a Trojan in the bachelor of arts theatre program at the School of Dramatic Arts. 
He completely immersed himself in the theatre scene after arriving at USC.
Throughout his college career, Ellis became heavily involved with Musical Theatre Repertory, a student-run theatre company on campus, which left unforgettable memories of Ellis that current students, like Chloe Willey, still look back on with smiles on their faces. One of these shows was “The 25th Annual Putnam County Spelling Bee.”
“The show has its challenges in that a lot of the characters have to stay stagnant a lot of the time, just because it’s very much a park and bark type of thing,” said Willey, a senior majoring in theatre with an emphasis in stage management who worked as a director on the show. “And he really made it a lot more dynamic than just a park and bark.” 
It was also within MTR that Ellis met one of his biggest influences throughout his college theatre journey: professor Parmer Fuller at the Thornton School of Music, who at the time was MTR’s faculty advisor.
“He believed in me from the get-go … and he took me under his wing as a freshman,” Ellis said. 
“Tyler has been just a complete pleasure in my life,” Fuller said. “My wife and I have a small music theatre company, and we would put on benefits and he volunteered a number of times to come in, to sing on our programs and he absolutely killed it.”
Like all of his mentors in the past, Fuller saw Ellis’ passion and preparation that set him apart from the rest, apparent when SDA put on Sondheim’s “Sunday in the Park with George” as a main stage production and he took on the titular role.
Having met his current manager at Authentic Talent & Literary Management through his performance in “Sunday,” Ellis said, “Stephen Sondheim, and working on his work, has given me more opportunities than almost anything…[and] changed my life.”
“Sunday,” unfortunately, was Ellis’ last live stage production at USC due to the coronavirus outbreak in the middle of his senior year. Despite this, Ellis knew he was at least “so much more sure of himself” than when he started.
Following many adrenaline-filled performances throughout high school and college, Ellis is still searching for that same feeling during the pandemic when traditional stage productions have come to a halt.
“I give TikTok so much credit,” Ellis said. “It’s given me so much. And I think it’ll continue to do so… I’ve been recognized on the street with my mask on. I’m like, what’s gonna happen when the pandemic’s over … Is this going to be a thing?” 
Not only has he been recognized on the street, but Ellis has also been recognized for his TikTok content by current Broadway professionals such as Jordan Fisher and Andrew Barth Feldman.
“I do know that a few casting directors follow me and they know my stuff,” Ellis said. “It feels like a lot of this potential energy is getting built up. And it just takes the pandemic being over for all that potential energy to turn into actual momentum.”
So what’s next for our main character?
“I think for me in the near future, I want to begin creating stuff with my friends, making it high quality and just writing and practicing,” Ellis said.
Austin Karkowsky, a senior majoring in music industry, has been one of these friends.
“He submitted a song for the ‘Ratatouille’ musical,’” Karkowsky said. “Tyler sent me some lyrics and I added some music to it, orchestrated it … I want to do a whole lot more of that.”
While TikTok has rekindled Ellis’ age-old desire to make people laugh, he’s ready to perform on another type of stage — standup comedy. Having already honed his comedic voice on the mobile app, Tyler now wants to test the waters with a real live audience.
“When standup houses are back, I definitely want to do more open mics,” Ellis said. “It’s an active thing that I’m trying every day [on TikTok], figuring out what makes me funny, and I’d love to … see if I can do that with a live audience without editing or any of that kind of stuff.”
With all this said and done, it’s safe to say that Ellis is definitely far from taking his final bow. Fresh out of college, after the pandemic, he’s just waiting to take the next opportunity that flies his way. Once he does, the world will undoubtedly begin to see Ellis for the star that he is and, as his hero described in 1954, the star he was born to be.

As USC’s scholarship acceptances roll out, new admits are extremely excited. From sharing their acceptances on TikTok to recording their family’s reactions to their acceptances, the class of 2025 is bouncing off the walls. USC has always given nice acceptance letters; everyone remembers the thick red box and fancy paper. However, this year it seems the new admits got an even bigger prize: AirPods. In their admission package, Marshall School of Business scholarship admits got a decorated red box, a gold-encrusted acceptance letter, an AirPods case, a pin of their state and AirPods. 
The special treatment and fast delivery are surprising, as the class of 2024 had to wait almost an entire year for a paper acceptance letter. USC told the class of 2024 that they were unable to deliver their usual red box, as the coronavirus complicated the process. Most students were understanding; after all, no one wants to endanger any workers. Although most students were accepted on March 26, 2020 through a virtual acceptance letter, they only received a physical acceptance letter in January 2021. Sadly, they did not receive the usual red box; rather a flimsy red envelope with three papers inside. 
It is not understandable why high schoolers would get their expensive acceptance boxes less than a week after acceptance while current first-year students are still waiting for theirs. 
As the AirPods are only for Marshall admits, admits from other schools are offended as well. It has been long known that USC treats some colleges better than others, but it’s surprising to see such dramatic favoritism so early on. This is not the first year USC has given better gifts to Marshall students. 
Earlier, Marshall scholarship admits would get luxurious gifts such as Amazon Fire tablets while admits from other colleges received a mug or a shirt. The backlash has been especially prominent this year, as the difference in treatment is more extreme than normal. Without even stepping foot on campus, some admits already feel less welcomed or valued for being in the Viterbi School for Engineering or Dornsife College of Letters, Arts and Sciences.
Marshall’s gift is insulting not only to current freshmen but also to the entire university. This school year, tuition was raised 3.5% to a whopping $59,260. USC has maintained its position that tuition “will help fund the high-quality education, broad range of outstanding academic programs and important research activities that are the hallmarks of USC.” 
However, students doubt the current online classes qualify as the “outstanding academic programs” USC promised. At a time when tuition is being raised and the quality of education is worse than ever, the school’s decision to spend money on frivolous AirPods for high schoolers who are not even committed USC students yet is offensive. 
Students do not know why the school has chosen such a specific and niche thing to spend money on. However, possible reasons can be inferred from USC’s past actions and values. 
The AirPods may have been gifted to protect the school’s yield. Yield rate is the percentage of students who accept their acceptance. The school has long played the rankings game, trying to raise its yield rate and lower its acceptance rate through various methods, such as merit scholarships and nice acceptance boxes. Perhaps giving the admits AirPods was a method to encourage them to enroll at the school. 
It could also have been an attempt to bring more prestige to Marshall. After the beloved Marshall Dean James Ellis was ousted, the college quickly hired Geoffrey Garrett, the former dean of the University of Pennsylvania’s Wharton School of Business. 
There was a lot of controversy surrounding this process, as Marshall hired Garrett after just four months of searching for a new dean. Garrett was the only person interviewed for the position in a list of 50 possible candidates. This process starkly contrasts the loyal Trojan Family USC often talks about; it seems like community and loyalty means nothing in the face of reputation and prestige.
In their mission statement, USC claims to prioritize students’ education and seek to “[develop] human beings and society as a whole through the cultivation and enrichment of the human mind and spirit.” AirPods do not contribute to the enrichment of the human mind, but perhaps this is yet another thing so complicated that administration must leave students in the dark about. After all, making current students feel welcomed or providing adequate financial aid is nothing compared to a higher yield, right?
