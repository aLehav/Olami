Azerbaijan launched unprovoked attacks on sovereign, internationally recognized territory of the Republic of Armenia on Sept. 13, killing 207 Armenian servicemen and civilians and displacing 7,600 civilians.
The recent outbreak of violence between the two countries is the deadliest since a 44-day war in 2020 in the Nagorno-Karabakh territory. The territory is a majority Armenian enclave that is internationally recognized as part of Azerbaijan but has claimed independence since 1991. Nagorno-Karabakh has historically been at the center of territorial disputes between Armenia and Azerbaijan, two former Soviet republics where conflict has been simmering for decades.
“There’s always been skirmishes on the border between Armenia and Azerbaijan over the decades, but there hasn’t been this type of blatant violence deep inside Armenian territory in towns [and] villages,” said Syuzanna Petrosyan, associate director of the USC Institute of Armenian Studies. “We’re not talking directly on the border. We’re talking about kilometers inside, where there’s communities of people, schools and pastures.”
Though a ceasefire halted last Tuesday’s attacks, many Armenians fear another full-scale war between the two countries, Petrosyan said, as Azerbaijan continues to make claims on Armenian territories.
“The people living [in Nagorno-Karabakh] don’t want to be part of Azerbaijan because they’re Armenian, and they know that for them being incorporated, fully controlled by Azerbaijan, means ethnic cleansing,” Petrosyan said. “Now that war has ended, and Azerbaijan has new claims on the Republic of Armenia, but there’s been so much history of violence and trauma. Every time Azerbaijan has come to a territory, there’s torture and crude violence.”
Mane Berikyan, a sophomore majoring in international relations, was working in the Armenian Institute when, soon after they happened, she found out about the attacks. She learned her aunt’s family woke up to the sound of shelling in Vardenis, one of the settlements that was attacked. 
“I think it was the most scared I’ve ever felt for my family’s safety,” Berikyan said. “It’s not the first time that their village has been [under fire] just because it’s close to the border, but it’s the first time that it was with this intensity and with other major towns deep inside Armenia, not very close to the border.”
Berikyan said that for a few hours, her relatives could not evacuate, but eventually male civilians were able to drive women and children to the capital. 
Gegham Mughnetsyan, an archivist at the Armenian Institute, was also working when the news of the attacks broke. He said another student worker at the Institute mentioned his brother was in the army serving in the attacked stretch of the border. Both he and Berikyan were attempting to get in contact with their families.
“It was a very chaotic moment where there is this war 5,000 miles away, but it was directly affecting the students in the middle of their work at USC,” Mughnetsyan said. “And we had to, at the moment, also scramble to get information from Armenia and try to find some sources …everybody was in this state of trying to look over the internet to try to find trustworthy information to see if this was war again.”
Berikyan said many Armenian students at USC are feeling scared, but also angry and “invisible” due to the administration’s silence on the conflict, despite the size of the Armenian community on campus. Around 700 Armenian students attend USC, with many hailing from Los Angeles — home to one of the largest Armenian diasporas in the world. Many Armenian students are also dismayed at the lack of resources offered by the administration during the difficult time. 
“We have a lot of events coming out soon,” Berikyan said. “We’re trying to channel the anger and fear into something productive, but it’s easy to just feel paralyzed and like you’re not able to do anything about it being so far away from your family and loved ones who are in danger.”
Armenian students coordinated several efforts in response to the crisis, including a fundraiser to support displaced Armenian civilians, an open letter jointly issued urging University communities to action and a vigil honoring lives lost in the recent attacks. 
During the initial week of the attacks, the USC Armenian Student Association started a fundraiser for Kooyrigs, a nonprofit organization providing on-the-ground humanitarian aid to displaced Armenian families. Donations have exceeded $2,000 so far. 
USC ASA also joined other ASAs at prominent universities across the nation in issuing an open letter Tuesday to their university communities. The letter calls for students and faculty to oppose Azerbaijan’s “assault on humanity” and demonstrate their solidarity with Armenians. 
The letter noted “horrifying developments,” such as a series of videos released Sept. 16 showing Azerbaijani soldiers celebrating the mutilation of female Armenian soldiers. Christine Almadjian, a senior majoring in law, history and culture, said Azeris, the main ethnic group in Azerbaijani, have international messaging channels where they created GIFs of such videos—one channel, Telegram, made more than 3,000 of them.
“It’s been the laughingstock of the Azeri channels and even among other officials,” Almadjian said. “They laugh at the fact that our identities are constantly at stake and at risk because of their violence. These are just aspects of the Armenian reality. These are things students have to cope with.”
The letter also called attention to the risk of cultural genocide in Armenia under Azerbaijan. The letter cited a recent Cornell University and Purdue University report detailing how Azerbaijan wiped out many Armenian cultural heritage sites under their jurisdiction. The letter additionally went on to mention Nancy Pelosi’s recent visit to Armenia on the weekend of Sept. 17. During her visit, Pelosi expressed strong support for Armenia, highlighting the country’s position as a democracy in a “sea of autocracy.”
On Wednesday evening, the Armenian Student Association held a candlelight vigil in the Religious Center Courtyard in support of Armenia under attack, where a priest was invited to make remarks and lead a prayer. Students lit candles and stood for a moment in silence to pay respects to those who died in the fighting.
The date of the Sept. 21 vigil held a deeper meaning to those who attended as well— it is the date Armenia won its independence from the Soviet Union in 1991. Araxi Malazian, a senior majoring in civil engineering, said that a day that traditionally called for celebration was sadly overshadowed by the recent violence. 
Malazian learned about last week’s attacks on social media after waking up and said she appreciated the vigil after an incredibly stressful week juggling “helping out in whatever way I can,” grieving and daily life.
“It just felt a little bit surreal to wake up to that and go about the rest of my day,” Malazian said. “So it’s nice to have events like [this, where] there’s something I can do to pay respect and show support.”
Correction: A previous version of this article stated that the attacks against Armenia began Sept. 14. They began on Sept. 13. The Daily Trojan regrets this error.

Around 35 million students attending higher education institutions will receive an application next month that will allow many of them to wipe out their student loans. For another 8 million borrowers, the process is already underway.
This undertaking comes after President Joe Biden’s Aug. 24 statement which outlined a three-part plan to lift the $1.7 trillion debt burden incurred from federal student loans. Aimed at low and middle-income households, it continues the freeze on loan repayments, cancels debt for borrowers the government deems “at highest risk of delinquencies or default once payments resume” and curates a new income-driven repayment plan to reduce future monthly payments.
For the 26% of undergraduate students at USC who receive federal loans, such as Andrew Lutz, a junior studying philosophy, politics and law, this plan will come as a welcome relief. 
“That’s money that I would either have to pay off with my own career for the next five to 10 years, or money that my parents would have to take out of the house,” he said. “It’ll probably cut the amount of time, including interest, that I’d have to take to pay back the loans by at least half.”
In canceling debt of up to $10,000 to $20,000, Lutz said he believes that the forgiveness plan offers a greater number of options for the future.
“It also gives me more peace of mind because I’m not a STEM major,” he said. “While there’s definitely a lot of options for me out of college, I don’t feel as much that I have to find something that’s going to be super lucrative right out of school.”
Victor Falcon, a first-generation sophomore studying business administration, said the plan is “making a huge difference” towards his decision on pursuing a fourth year at USC rather than concluding his undergraduate studies after three.
Student loan debt accounts for the second-highest consumer debt category in the United States, second only to mortgage debt and higher than credit card and auto loan debt. California holds the greatest contribution to this segment of debt, totaling $141.8 billion for a combined population of undergraduate and graduate students.
“I definitely feel like I’m getting a better deal right now from school,” Lutz said. “It often feels like if you want to get an education, you have to go into an overbearing amount of debt.”
While the plan aids USC’s current crop of students in managing their debt, there are some who suggest that the school must still do more to increase its affordability. Attending the University in the 2022-23 academic year is estimated to come with a price tag of $63,468 just for tuition — 53% more than the national average of $41,568. 
“USC wants to proclaim itself as a top-tier institution… on par with top-ranking Ivy League schools,” Falcon said. “A lot of these schools are dropping their tuition and guaranteeing free tuition for all families less than $100,000.”
In April 2022, Bloomberg reported that the average cost of tuition at an Ivy League school  is falling by around 5% on average, adjusted for inflation. While the University of Pennsylvania raised its tuition by 4%, it increased its financial aid by 5.25%. Earlier this month, Princeton University expanded its aid package by offering free tuition to students from families that earn less than $100,000.
USC’s most recent step in need-based funding came in February 2020, when it committed over $30 million to covering tuition for families making less than $80,000 per year.
“[The University] needs to make financial aid more accessible, more streamlined, especially in reaching out to first- generation students who are new to this process. Also, being more generous with their aid, or maybe capping the cost,” Falcon said. “Let’s say you’re a freshman, USC [could] guarantee that the costs to come here are going to be fixed.”
Meanwhile, others believe that while the policy may help USC students, it is funneling funding away from areas that need it more. 
“It’s going to help places like USC, but perhaps there are better ways of spending these funds and the people who will really hurt,” said Robert Dekle, an economics professor at the Dornsife College of Letters, Arts and Sciences. “[With a degree], you’re going to get paid back through the market, it’s just an investment in yourself.” 
While California holds the largest level of student loan debt, it also has the third lowest average student loan debt, at $21,125. Sixty-five percent of Americans don’t attend college, but the forgiveness plan will cost taxpayers an estimated $400 billion over 10 years. 
“Use the money for preschool education, and there’ll be more impact on income equality,” Dekle said. 
Falcon “wholeheartedly disagrees” with the idea that the plan won’t help lower-income families, since it is directed towards families who make under $150,000. 
“I feel like this is completely a step in the right direction,” he said. “I feel that Senate debt relief should really increase the amount. I’m more in favor of $50k forgiveness.”
For years, progressive members of Congress have lobbied for the cancellation of $50,000 in student loan debt. After the economic fallout of the coronavirus pandemic, which affected borrowers’ ability to pay back their loans, Congress and both the Trump and Biden administrations have responded with historic student loan relief and pauses on federal student loan payments.
When looking to the future, Falcon and Dekle said that the long-term focus for achieving greater equity in education should not lie only on the question of student debt.
“I know that student debt forgiveness isn’t the end-all be-all,” Falcon said. “It should really be expanded. I believe that the United States should adopt a system closer to the education system in Europe for higher education, where citizens are paying little to nothing to go to college and follow their dreams. Here in the United States, we’re paying an exorbitant amount of money.”
Dekle said he has doubts over the plan’s longevity and ensuing efficiency, asking if administrations will “perennially have a $10,000 forgiveness program.”
“Education has externalities,” Dekle said. “There’s the question of whether that individual [forgiven of a student loan] should benefit so much at the expense of other programs… my feeling is more balanced towards greater needs than this.”

Former East Wing press secretary Noelia Rodríguez and Secret Service agent Héctor Hernández recounted their experiences working in the White House at the event “Hispanics in the White House: From the Secret Service to the First Lady’s Office” Thursday. 
The wide-ranging conversation touched on personal anecdotes of the pair’s time in the White House, as well as how being Latinx has impacted their careers and their hopes for the political future of America. 
Rodríguez, who is a Fall 2022 fellow for the USC Dornsife Center for the Political Future, got her start in Los Angeles politics before working in Washington, D.C. Rodríguez was former L.A. Mayor Richard Riordan’s press secretary and then his deputy mayor. Rodríguez said she was confused upon receiving an invitation to interview for the position as First Lady Laura Bush’s press secretary. 
“I literally laughed and said, I’m a Democrat from California, and I just worked on this little project called the Democratic Convention,” Rodríguez said. 
Rodríguez interviewed for Laura Bush’s office and was offered a job as press secretary on the spot.
Rodríguez was the first Mexican American to be the press secretary for the first lady, but she said she never felt out of place in the Bush White House. 
“I never thought about the fact that I’m Mexican American or anything like that,” Rodríguez said.
She felt that since President George W. Bush had previously served as the governor of Texas, he had a unique perspective on the importance of Mexico-America relations. Rodríguez recalled that President Bush’s first state dinner, just days before 9/11, was with Vicente Fox Quesada, the president of Mexico at the time. While preparing for the state dinner, Laura Bush noticed that the table settings had cascading green grapes and asked to have them removed. 
“Obviously, it would have created a political reference to grape growers and farm pickers and César Chávez,” Rodríguez said. “The fact that she was the one who recognized it told me a lot about Mrs. Bush and the president.”
While Rodríguez never thought that her heritage negatively affected her career, Hernández had a different experience. 
Hernández, who grew up in the predominantly Hispanic community of El Paso, Texas, said he was taken aback by the discrimination he faced in the workforce. He recalled showing up to his first day at the Social Security Administration in Oklahoma, and the lady at the front desk turned around and yelled, “Our new Hispanic is here!” 
“I felt like an Amazon package,” he said. 
Hernández started out in the Secret Service when Bill Clinton was president, and later became the first Latino to serve in the Vice Presidential Protection Division, where he was in charge of Former Vice President Mike Pence’s security detail. 
Hernández said that sometimes he felt discriminated against, but he still was honored to work at the White House. 
“Did I let that bog me down? Did I let that bury me? Did I let that steer me away from continuing to push forward? Absolutely not,” he said. 
Despite any discrimination they faced in their time in the White House, both Hernández and Rodríguez said they are passionate Americans. 
“There is no other place in this entire earth that God created, none better than the United States of America. None,” Hernández said. 
Their patriotism did not go unnoticed by the audience. 
“American exceptionalism has a negative connotation, at least in my generation,” one participant said. 
In response, Rodríguez said that the level of discord in the current political sphere is not the norm.
“Now the responsibility is, quite frankly, up to your generation to pivot back so that we have at least a modicum of civility among our elected officials and our public officials,” she said. 
Dr. María Romero-Morales, who moderated the event, also shared her experience as a Latina working in a high-level position. Romero-Morales is the assistant chief inclusion and diversity officer for communication, community and student engagement at USC. 
Romero-Morales has a long history at the University, having received her bachelor’s, master’s and doctorate degrees from USC. She recalled looking at Bovard Auditorium, where she now has an office, as an undergraduate and wondering who worked in the building. Now, Romero-Morales said she makes sure to be visible to students from her office window, which faces the Ronald Tutor Campus Center. 
“I purposely want you to see me in there, and I want you to see that there is a woman of color, a Latina, first gen, transfer student who has made their journey from all these different pathways into USC, and now I’m in Bovard,” Romero-Morales said. 
Like Romero-Morales, Hernández and Rodríguez said they are hopeful that more Latinx people will have the opportunity to effect change. Rodríguez noted that just two weeks ago, Vanessa Valdivia, a Latina Annenberg alumni, was tapped as First Lady Jill Biden’s press secretary. 
“We may have been the first,” Rodríguez said. “But we take very seriously that we’re not the last.”

The family of Peng Wang, a 29-year-old graduate student at Chapman University, filed a wrongful-death lawsuit against USC and two of its students, Biangliang Li and Ting Su, after Wang’s death on set of a School of Cinematic Arts shoot in April. The family claims that a driver with proper training would have never inflicted such an erroneous accident.
Wang died from an off-road vehicle crash on a large sand dune in the Imperial Sand Dunes Recreation Area. During production, Wang, as well as three other USC students, were traveling throughout the recreation area when their 2022 Can-Am Maverick UTV overturned down the sand dune. The other students all survived the crash. According to a California Highway Patrol news release, “all parties were wearing the proper safety equipment” except for the late cinematographer, who was not wearing a seatbelt. 
CHP officers had previously recommended to the Imperial County district attorney to bring charges of involuntary manslaughter against USC student Biangliang Li. Mario Vela, senior deputy district attorney, stated on Tuesday he will not be following through with the charges, stating to the Los Angeles Times that he has found no criminal offense committed, and that “this was just a terrible accident that unfortunately resulted in a tragedy.”
Wang was unfamiliar with the proper operation and safety protocols required for riding the off-road vehicle. Su had to assist Wang in putting on his helmet. The family states in the suit, “this should have placed Su and Li on heightened alert regarding [Wang’s] lack of familiarity with the proper… safety protocols for the [off-road vehicle].”
USC has a policy that any filming activity that involves off-road vehicles or is further than 50 miles from campus requires explicit approval from the University. Imperial Sand Dunes Recreation Area is about 230 miles southeast of campus.
When the tragedy occurred, SCA Dean Elizabeth Daley released a statement to the SCA community that the University was “unaware of any such approvals having been requested or provided in this tragic matter.”
According to the lawsuit filed in Los Angeles County Superior Court, Wang’s parents alleged that the University had granted the crew permission to shoot in the desert as well as the usage of off-roading equipment. SCA approved a “student certification” for the film and assigned the film a production number on April 5.
Charges for the rental of an off-road vehicle as well as the location of where the film was going to be shot were stated in the approved budget of the short. 
“USC has a responsibility to return the people who make its films back to their families intact,” Wang’s parents stated in the suit. “USC is liable for its negligent failure to exercise control over, and to ensure safety on, the ‘Finale’ student film project. That negligence resulted in [Wang’s] death and the ensuing damages for which plaintiffs bring suit to recover.”
As of now, the family is seeking unspecified damages.
“We are honored to represent Peng “Aaron” Wang’s parents, and look forward to demonstrating that USC needs to improve the way it manages student films in order to adequately protect young people like Aaron from injury or death,” wrote Brian Strange, the family’s lawyer, in a statement to the Los Angeles Times. 
The University declines these allegations, writing a statement to the Daily Trojan that “USC was not responsible for Mr. Wang’s tragic death. We will be sharing the facts about our robust safety procedures and safety record in court.”
Wang was pursuing a master of fine arts degree at Chapman University and passed away weeks before the end of his master’s fine arts course. Stephan Galloway, dean of Dodge College of Film and Media Arts at Chapman University, awarded Wang his degree posthumously. 
Wang helped USC students complete three films as part of a directing class at SCA. Wang had been involved in award-winning films before “Finale,” such as the short “Daemon,” which received the award for the Best Drama Short at the 2020 Los Angeles Film Awards. His final project, “Finale,” was a short depicting the hallucination and death of a man in the desert.

Josh Wolk struck me as surprisingly nice for a guy who runs headlines like “Cucumber Sick and Tired of Just Being Used For Sex” and “Top 10 GILFs Who Died Before I Got The Chance.” (He wrote neither of those articles, but I figure this is an acceptable instance of guilt by association.) 
Wolk is president of The Sack of Troy, USC’s self-acclaimed “second-best parody newspaper” — you’ve probably seen it on Instagram at some point. The paper publishes a regular stream of content varying in sexual innuendo, unvarying in hilarity and probably sexier than the Daily Trojan (bo-ring).
Anyways. Last weekend, The Sack was gracious enough to allow me to sit in on its weekly pitch meeting in the hopes of answering just one question: Do you (yes, you) have what it takes to join The Sack of Troy?
To be fair, not all of The Sack’s stories contain innuendo or outright references to foodstuffs in bodily orifices — that was apparent from the onset of the Sunday evening staff meeting on the first floor of Waite Phillips Hall. 
We opened with a round of pitches, where every writer recited headline ideas that I assume some meticulously crafted over the week, and some wrote on the spot. During a later speed brainstorm on a surprise topic, most ideas seemed to come with a preceding “I hate this one” or “This sounded a lot better in my head.” Typical.
Each pitch was accompanied by laughter from the rest of the team — the volume of which seemed to correlate to the hilarity of the idea — then the relief of approval from Editor-in-Chief Sarah Cortina, who typically chose one or two of each writer’s ideas to move forward with. Every idea seemed to at least get a pity laugh.
At one point, a writer pitched a headline reading “‘Ariel is Supposed to be White,’ Says Man Who is Supposed to be Employed.” That one got quite a few chuckles, but Cortina mistook “Ariel” for “areola” — though she still laughed along and issued her stamp of approval. Not every idea was a sex joke, but Cortina clearly wasn’t afraid of nipple talk. (She did later approve the original pitch.)
After the meeting, I got to talk with Wolk and Mia Young, who was last year’s editor-in-chief. (I wasn’t allowed to interview Cortina, because she also writes for the Daily Trojan.) I asked the two about finding the right balance between crude humor and, well, everything else.
Wolk argued that good satire often isn’t what shocks with its crudeness; it’s the stuff that points out real-world happenings and can spark a bigger conversation. Onion articles tend to be more memorable than op-eds in The Atlantic, he posited.
“It’s very easy for a lot of people to hear something simple, like a pun or something that just is funny and engage within the meeting,” Young said. “And they think that that equates to like, ‘A lot of people laughed at this because this is good satire.’”
(For the record, Young is the one who wrote the cucumber dildo story.)
But what Young said reminded me of a moment in the meeting when Wolk, not unlike your English teacher, gave a lecture on best-practice writing and a breakdown of what often makes comedy funny. He referenced ClickHole, a satirical news website where the humor tends to lie mostly in shock, rather than any sort of carefully crafted jabs.
“[ClickHole] is really funny,” Wolk said. “It’s just I don’t want to just become ClickHole — we can sprinkle a little bit. It’s the garnish.” 
That was followed by a very audible groan from the audience.
Wolk struck me as the nerd in the room, presenting writing tips that were quite similar to those I’ve heard in “real” newsrooms (avoid pleonasms, vary sentence length, don’t nominalize, etc.) and dutifully reminding writers that headlines must be self-contained jokes (because most people never actually read the body text).
In the past, Wolk has written stories that jab at conservative abortion policy, Jeff Bezos and high school sports prayers; he’s supposedly even inspired Change.org petitions in poking fun at the University.
“Don’t worry about likes,” Wolk said during the meeting. “Worry about saying what you want to say.”
So what does The Sack look for in its applicants? For one, I can report that while hardly every writer seemed to consistently crank out gold, it seemed fairly obvious that even the new writers were willing to pitch and workshop their ideas with others.
Wolk said that the application process isn’t particularly rigorous or selective, but that the team will, obviously, reject applications that just aren’t funny. He was pretty clear that everybody grows as a writer and comedian even after getting accepted onto staff, and noted that the team will sometimes reject applicants but hope that they reapply after growing as writers.
Want my two cents? If there’s one thing I learned from that meeting, it’s that satirical writing isn’t just the act of writing funny shit; it’s the act of writing funny thoughtful shit. Show that you’re an intelligent comedian. 
There are real and serious problems in the world that we try to shed light on here at the Daily Trojan and in the news industry more broadly. I learned this weekend that The Sack seems to be doing exactly what we are too — it’s just that sometimes, you need a good laugh to start a serious conversation.
I also might not be the best person to take advice from. There was a point in the meeting where the staff was brainstorming responses for an advice column, and one of the audience-submitted questions was something to the effect of: “My ballsack hurts, what should I do?” A staffer prompted me to share an idea, so I suggested replying with the link to an internet autofellatio tutorial. 
That one got a few pity laughs.

I grew up in a town very comically, very stereotypically called Gilbert, Arizona. Yes, Gilbert, like a farmer boy born and raised in Arkansas might be named. Most of the time, I found myself feeling very much on the outskirts of this majority Latter Day Saints town filled with white girls in blue poplin dresses and boys donning Bass Pro Shops hats who looked at me as if I were an alien from another planet. Unsurprisingly, being Black, visibly Muslim as a hijabi and in a place no one has ever seen the two together will draw stares — not the good kind. 
A very inconvenient and even further isolating facet of growing up in such a community was the fact that halal food was nowhere to be found. The nearest halal grocery store was a 30-minute drive away in Tempe, a city notably more diverse than Gilbert. My parents, who worked while also raising four kids, rarely had the time to make the trip, and we found that it was simply easier to shop at grocery stores near us. Everything we needed was at Target or Walmart, each a five-minute drive from our house.
The term “halal” means permissible by God, and for Muslims, applies to all aspects of life. The term “haram,” or forbidden, means the opposite. Food items and drinks that are haram include pork, carnivorous animals and alcohol, but also include meat not slaughtered in a halal way. In order for this to happen, the name of God needs to be mentioned, the butcher must be Muslim, Jewish or Christian, at least three of the four main jugular veins must be cut and, of course, it must be done in the most humane way possible. The term for halal meat is “zabiha,” and I had no idea it existed until I was 15. This is the case for plenty of other Muslims in America. Friends from states such as Texas and Kansas had similar experiences not eating zabiha meat, and after coming to USC, I found that the majority of Muslim students that were raised in California, or other states with more diverse populations, ate zabiha. 
There’s a sense of guilt that comes with seeing other Muslims do something that you don’t. I often find myself thinking twice about picking up the bulgogi fried rice from the Trader Joe’s frozen section or a chicken breast for pasta night. Though I now try to take the meatless option as often as possible or make it a point to find zabiha restaurants when out with Muslim friends, it’s still difficult to be able to eat it consistently. Unfortunately, being a student at USC does not make it any easier.
USC has very few halal options. If you ask, you can pay for a frozen halal meal at the Village Dining Hall, and eat just the beef — but nothing made with ground beef — from any of the dining halls. But other than that, there isn’t much else. The nearest halal butcher and halal restaurants aren’t close enough to walk or Fryft from campus and are not easily accessible to students without cars. As a result, campus dining is all that some have. 
Many Muslim freshmen find themselves having to pay over $3,000 for the required meal plan and not even being able to eat much of what is offered. Why should Muslim students have to eat frozen packaged meals while other students can eat the majority of what’s served in the dining halls? Shouldn’t the dining hall cater to everyone? If the beef is halal, why not the chicken? The same can be said for students who eat kosher food, which while I don’t have much knowledge of, I do know that USC’s dining options alienate students with dietary restrictions outside of being vegetarian. 
Muslims on campus have proposed that Dolan’s, a halal restaurant that specializes in Uyghur cuisine, be opened in the USC Village. It’s not as though this would drastically impact others who aren’t Muslim either, as there’s no tangible difference between zabiha and non-halal meat. If anything, a new halal restaurant in the Village would not only give Muslim students another option but also offer a new cultural cuisine that would add to the Village’s already diverse dining options. Even though a petition for this gained almost 1,000 signatures, it remains overlooked by USC’s administration.
For a school that claims to care about each and every one of its students, USC isn’t very good at showing it. It should be the school’s top priority to cater to the needs of every student, regardless of identity. While it may cost more, an impactful investment would pay for itself in a much more meaningful way — and we know USC’s budget can afford it.

As college students with club meetings to attend, endless essays to do and social lives to salvage, it can be hard to make time for assigned reading — let alone reading for pleasure. Whether you’re someone who updates Goodreads daily or has not read a book for fun in 10 years, it’s impossible to deny the power of storytelling. And, especially, the power of the memoir.
Memoirs are unique because they allow readers a glimpse into the author’s life and experiences. They can expose readers to new cultures and allow readers to gain a better understanding of those around them.
So, if you are able to find some time in your busy schedule, here are eight memoirs that are guaranteed to expand your worldview. 
“Crying in H Mart” by Michelle Zauner
Michelle Zauner, lead singer of the band Japanese Breakfast, released her debut memoir “Crying in H Mart” in 2021. Since then, the book has skyrocketed in popularity, remaining on the New York Times’ nonfiction bestseller list for over a year. “Crying in H Mart” is an absolutely heart-wrenching must-read for everyone. Through the discussion of her mother’s battle with terminal cancer, Zauner dives into discussions of culture, food and her Korean American identity. The title “Crying in H Mart” introduces the idea of food as a cultural identifier, a motif which continues throughout the memoir as Zauner uses Korean food to connect with her mother. An important reflection on culture, identity and familial relationships, Zauner’s “Crying in H Mart” is devastating and gripping in the best ways. 
“I’m Glad My Mom Died” by Jennette McCurdy
Many of us grew up watching Jennette McCurdy as the tough yet lovable cool-girl Sam Puckett on “iCarly.” You might have even wanted to be like her — confident, funny and living the life of a web star. Still, all McCurdy ever wanted was freedom from the role. In her memoir, “I’m Glad My Mom Died,” McCurdy sheds light on the abuse that she faced both behind-the-scenes of Nickelodeon and in her own home. The book details the emotional abuse McCurdy’s mother inflicted upon her in the most touching and heartbreaking way. This memoir was unexpected, but an absolutely necessary read.
“Between the World and Me” by Ta-Nehisi Coates
In this letter to his son, Ta-Nehisi Coates uses his experience growing up as a Black man in Baltimore, Maryland as an instruction manual for life. “Between the World and Me” is Coates’ lyrical masterpiece, giving readers a glimpse into what it means to be a Black man in America. This heart-wrenching memoir details many of Coates’ experiences, but it truly shines in Coates’ understanding of history and suggestions on how to move forward. “Between the World and Me” explores the ways that we keep living despite the obstacles that try to hold us back.
“Educated” by Tara Westover
“Educated” illustrates Westover’s experience in a survivalist family who trusted no one other than themselves; she was forced to fight for everything, most importantly the ability to attend school. While so many of us take education for granted, Westover grew up in an environment where her education was not valued. “Educated” does not only delve into Westover’s struggle, but also highlights why education is so valuable yet still inaccessible to so many.
“Real American: A Memoir” by Julie Lythcott-Haims
Growing up as a biracial Black woman in America, Julie Lythcott-Haims certainly faced her fair share of struggles. The title of the book, “Real American,” truly sums up Lythcott-Haims. Growing up in America with a white mother and a Black father, she speaks about a number of quintessential American experiences, both good and bad. “Real American” showcases the often harsh realities of living as a Black woman in America, while speaking on complicated issues of identity that we can all relate to in some capacity.
“¡Hola Papi!: How to Come Out in a Walmart Parking Lot and Other Life Lessons” by John Paul Brammer
The idea for “¡Hola Papi!” began with John Paul Brammer’s advice column of the same name in Grindr’s magazine INTO. With the popularity of his advice column, Brammer turned a collection of essays about growing up as a queer Latino in a small town into a heartfelt and hilarious memoir. Brammer’s unique ability to tackle complex issues in a lighthearted way makes this memoir special — even using Lady Gaga to discuss his complex experience with internalized homophobia. This memoir is a fantastic read for queer people, but regardless of whether you identify as LGBTQ+ or not, “¡Hola Papi!” is guaranteed not only  to make you laugh out loud but also to help you learn.
“Red Azalea” by Anchee Min
In “Red Azalea,” Anchee Min recounts her harrowing experience growing up in Mao Zedong’s China. Both emotional and informational, this memoir will give you eyes into that period of China’s history. From working in a labor camp and beginning a forbidden romance with another woman to winning the lead role in a Communist propaganda film, Min’s life was never typical. “Red Azalea” illuminates all of the unimaginable tragedy in Mao’s China while remaining deeply personal and heartfelt.
“I Remember Nothing and Other Reflections” by Nora Ephron
Nora Ephron is the woman responsible for so many of the beloved rom-coms we love to rewatch, with her credits including legendary titles such as “When Harry Met Sally…” (1989) and “You’ve Got Mail” (1998). Ephron created so many beloved films, and while less popular, her books are just as iconic. “I Remember Nothing” is Ephron’s collection of essays telling stories of her life from childhood to old age. Ephron’s musings on her life are an absolute must-read, with “I Remember Nothing” being funny, witty and scarily relatable.

As an A&E editor, music consumes a large part of my life. So much so that I don’t watch shows or movies — sorry to my writers that pitch me stuff about that, it’s not my forté. I listen to a range of music from different countries and their subgenres. So you’d think that with this column idea it’d be hard for me to narrow it down to a single topic. Nah.
I’m not one to feel so homesick that my day is ruined and I’m in a depressive state for that moment, but I do feel some small bursts of “Damn, I wish I was back in Jersey with my family and the boys.” I find myself playing “Mama” by Aminé multiple times every month, and it just has me thinking about my mother — obviously — and also my family. 
So I start to dig myself into a hole, listening to more songs based on family. “Mama” is basically a letter to Aminé’s mother appreciating & reminiscing the times they spent together, essentially giving her a song to listen to when he’s away. It’s evident when he melodically raps, “I’ma write you a song to put on everyday / So the times that I’m gone, you could smile when it plays.”
Earlier in the song, Aminé has a verse where he raps, “Used to promise when I’m rich that I would get your favorite whip / You was my lift before the Lyft, so you deserve you a coupe / Twenty-plus years at the Post Office (Yeah)  / You was workin’ graveyard shifts for the both of us (Yeah) / You deserve a long vacation, a standing ovation,” and later remarks, “I’ma take you to the GRAMMYs in a yellow suit / Put ya in Chanel just to show ‘em how my mama do.”
It reminds me of the same goals I have, watching my mother go to work at a factory six days a week on minimum wage, sometimes working 10 days back to back, and wanting to just help my family out financially in the future. And that’s why I chose journalism, the most lucrative major known to man — it’s not, not even close. 
It also doesn’t help that Aminé brought Charlie Wilson to feature on the track, who, for me, is one of the greatest feature artists out there. His vocals on the track just make the song hit harder and remind me why I still need to do fairly well in school, ‘cause I want the best for my mama and my family. 
Other songs that remind me of my family are “Grow Up” by King Lil G and “Summerhouse” by Kota The Friend. In “Grow Up, ” the Los Angeles native talks about growing up in a difficult neighborhood with a single mother, and feeling like he disappointed his mother because he got involved in the gang lifestyle. While I may not share those exact sentiments, I do feel that sometimes I do things that may disappoint my mother, and it hurts. 
Sometimes I don’t act in the best manner towards my mother — it’s all love at the end of the day — which causes me to think, “Why the fuck am I acting like this? She works so hard to give me as much as she can and I’m here pissing her off.” That’s just on some occasions though. For the most part, I’d say I’m very friendly and loving towards my parents. 
The latter isn’t strictly about family and life, but Kota does rap about those topics for a few bars. Towards the end of the song, the New York rapper says, “Momma call me, I’m gone now / All she want is some FaceTime / Baby boy he all grown now, she just want us all home now,” and wow, that shit hits harder now than when I first listened to it after the album dropped in 2020. Also, the voice memo of that little kid saying, “Hello did you miss me? I missed you. I’m back,” melts my heart — it’s fucking adorable. 
It also reminds me of a conversation my dad and I had when talking about me moving to Cali to study. He said it reminds him of when he left El Salvador and was thousands of miles away from everyone. But it’s different for me. There’s no Boss Revolution cards they have to buy to talk to me, all they gotta do is FaceTime me. If I want to go back to Jersey, I just have to buy a ticket, there’s no asking the United States government for permission to leave for El Salvador. 
There’s plenty of other songs I love that talk about parents and family, like “Dear Mama” by Tupac, “Dance with my Father” by Luther VanDross and “Bloom” by bLAck pARty, with the latter being a track bLAck pARty dedicated to his younger sister. I always thought about making a playlist full of songs that are family oriented, but I always forget to do it, like I do with so many things. Oh, and “Family Business” by Kanye West is another classic. 
Remember to call your parents, siblings, friends or anyone else back home. I haven’t called my mom and sister in like two weeks, and wow does it suck being busy. I’m definitely calling them after writing this article.

After a dominant 45-17 win over Fresno State last Saturday, the Trojans are back on the road as they face 3-0 Oregon State on Saturday night.
USC is 63-12-4 against Oregon State all time, with its last win against the Beavers coming in 2018. The last time the two teams played, it was a 45-27 victory for Oregon State, as the Beavers had 535 yards of total offense. Oregon State really hurt the Trojans on the ground with 322 yards rushing as a team. On Saturday, Oregon State’s red zone offense will be one of the biggest challenges facing the Trojans as the Beavers have scored touchdowns on all 14 red zone trips.
“They’re a little bit of a different challenge in the red zone,” defensive coordinator Alex Grinch said. “You get in that goal line area and they’re able to use multiple tight ends and possibly even the wildcat formation.”
Oregon State’s rushing attack has been a critical part of their success this season and in their previous game against Montana State, the Beavers had 214 rushing yards as a team. Against Boise State and Fresno State, the Beavers ran for a combined 356 yards. Similar to week two’s matchup against Stanford, the Trojans still have last year’s loss at the back of their minds.
“I remember that they had 300 rushing yards,” redshirt freshman cornerback Ceyair Wright said. “They like running the ball, so that’s one thing I think we definitely need to stop.”
Oregon State redshirt junior quarterback Chance Nolan will also be a key player USC must contain on Saturday. Nolan is coming off a performance in which he threw for 276 yards and four touchdowns against Montana State, and on the season, Nolan has thrown for 746 yards and seven touchdown passes. Nolan also had success against the Trojans in last year’s meeting as he threw for 213 yards and four touchdowns.
USC still sits at No. 7 in the power rankings and the Trojans boast an offense currently averaging 50.7 points per game. The offense looks forward to a unique challenge that Oregon State’s defense presents this week.
“Throughout our past three games, we’ve had times where we’ve stalled,” sophomore quarterback Caleb Williams said. “It teaches us that we have to be more consistent and worry about the details.”
Williams has been excellent for USC, having thrown for 874 yards and eight touchdowns while completing 74% of his passes. Williams and the offense have been sensational throughout the first three weeks of the season, but will be tasked with holding off Oregon State’s formidable defensive front.
“We need to make sure we are all in one,” Williams said. “When they make their shifts and their moves, I have to make sure I don’t snap it so the line can readjust their run calls or pass check calls.”
It will be important for Williams and the Trojans to not commit any turnovers or give Oregon State any other advantages that could lead to a home victory. As Williams continues his second season in Hhead Ccoach Lincoln Riley’s system, he is always looking for areas for improvement.
“I’ve been working on knowing my checks throughout each week, being more consistent and accurate and getting through my reads,” Williams said. “Instead of wanting the big post ball or go ball, it is important to make the defense play to our offense.”
USC’s chemistry on offense has been one of the factors leading to their 3-0 record, and while Oregon State will look to disrupt it on Saturday, the Trojans are ready for the challenge in front of them.
“They’re a great team and we just have to be ready come Saturday,” sophomore wide receiver Mario Williams said. “They definitely play more man coverage than other coverages, but we’re just focused on getting our job done and doing what we have to do on Saturday.”
Williams has caught 12 passes for 194 yards and one touchdown so far this season for the Trojans.
USC and Oregon State are set to kick off Saturday’s game at 6:30 p.m. at Reser Stadium.

Officially, Ecuador will seemingly open the 22nd edition of the FIFA World Cup when they face the host nation in the tournament opener on Nov. 20. But, that was put at risk due to one player and his birth certificate. 
A few months ago, Chile started a legal debate with FIFA when they called for a review on their game against Ecuador, claiming that Byron Castillo was ineligible to represent Ecuador. The Chilean Football Federation claimed that Ecuador’s camp had used false passports and birth certificates for selected players. 
FIFA stated that everything was clear and legitimate, despite Chile’s claims that winger Castillo was not born in Ecuador, but rather in Tumaco, Colombia. However, the officials of the largest soccer organization stated that the decision would rely on the pending investigation. 
At that time, the Ecuadorian Federation submitted new evidence to FIFA, including an audio where Castillo himself admitted that he was in fact born in Colombia. He also stated that he lied on his birth certificate and was not born in 1998; instead, he was born in 1995. 
In the audio, which first appeared four years ago, he explains that his full name is actually spelled Bayron Javier Castillo Segura, rather than what appears on his Ecuadorian birth certificate, Byron David Castillo Segura. 
The audio supported the claims established by the Chilean Soccer Federation in an attempt to return to the World Cup after eight years of absence. However, this digging operation was not enough to grant Chile a last-minute ticket to Qatar. FIFA officially announced that Ecuador would remain the second seed in the A group.  
Even after the official decision by soccer’s leading organization, we must take into account the incredible precedent that informed this case. In 2016, the Bolivian soccer federation was in a similar situation when they aligned defender Nelson Cabrera in a match against Chile and Peru. Cabrera, who was born in Paraguay, led FIFA to penalize the Bolivian side, forcing them to forfeit their two matches. The decision then raised Chile above Argentina in fifth place of the ten-team CONMEBOL qualifying group. Then, FIFA chose to keep the ruling and cause Bolivia to lose the four points earned in those two windows. Evidently, that decision was taken with ample time before the start of the World Cup. But, time is something FIFA did not have when reaching a verdict this time around. 
The Byron Castillo case also shares similarities with that of Congolese defender Chenzel Mbemba. Then playing for Portuguese side Porto FC, the defender was outed by his own club for allegedly falsifying his birth certificate. Due to increased uncertainty about his age, Porto decided to end their relationship with Mbemba after finding he had four different birth certificates each with a different age. The player had allegedly listed 1988 as his birth year when he first signed with his first two clubs in Congo. In his participation in the Africa Cup of Nations qualifiers in 2011, his birth year listed was 1991. According to the Belgian club Anderlecht’s records, Embembe was born in 1994. 
The increased uncertainty regarding the falsification of birth records by the player led him to be sacked from Porto. Now, he is a starting defender for French side Olympique de Marseille. 
With these recent actions, FIFA was under pressure to quickly resolve the issue and calm the Ecuadorian fans who were uncertain about their place in the upcoming World Cup. Unfortunately, these stories will continue to appear as we continue to live in a society where migration is a constant. Many who see the story of Byron Castillo assume that it is normal for one to leave their country of origin soon after birth in order to find a better life, better opportunities and a better future. 
That is all Byron Castillo was looking for when he made this switch: a chance at his professional soccer dream, and now that is what he will obtain. Castillo is faced with a chance to show his character and skills on the pitch when later this fall he, alongside La Tri, will face similars like Qatar, the Netherlands and Senegal.
