This week’s Students Talk Back series, entitled “The United States’ Economy” and hosted by the Jesse M. Unruh Institute of Politics, focused on the effects of minimum wage on the local and national economy. The panel was on Wednesday afternoon in the Ronald Tutor Campus Center.
The panel consisted of Douglas Herman, political strategist from The Strategy Group; David Englin, executive vice president of BizFed, a grassroots alliance advocating for stronger public policies that increases regional economy; Jessica Yu, finance director of the USC College Democrats; and Sarah Dhanaphatana, secretary of the USC College Republicans and Daily Trojan deputy features editor.
Dan Schnur, director of the Unruh Institute, was joined by Daily Trojan editorial director Sonali Seth to moderate the panel.
One of the primary topics discussed by the panel was the effects of increasing the minimum wage to various sectors and whether it is advisable to do so. Englin argued that his alliance’s 135 business membership is indifferent to the minimum wage increase, according to its annual survey.
“Sixty percent of our members told us that they were not concerned whether the minimum wage increases. About 20 percent that are included in that 60 percent thought that increasing the minimum wage might be good for their businesses,” he said. “So, especially in California, where the general cultural baseline is much farther in the left than the rest of the country, I think the business community broadly is a little less black and white in these issues.”
However, he was quick to add that other small business owners, such as restaurant and retail owners, are concerned about reducing jobs if the minimum wage spikes, aggravating the broader issue on poverty.
“We would argue that raising the minimum wage is not mathematically the right approach to addressing poverty because raising somebody from $10 to $15 an hour when you’re not doing anything about the housing costs, transportation costs, all the other costs of living in L.A. is not actually lifting them out of poverty.”
Rather than increase the minimum wage, Englin suggested that resources be put into education, training and creation of jobs to address the issue of poverty.
Herman agreed that raising the minimum wage is not a solution to poverty. He argued that the current minimum wage in California of $9 per hour, which is above the federal minimum wage of $7.25 and will increase to $10 in January, is not guaranteed to lift someone out of the federal poverty level. The stagnation of the minimum wage, not keeping up with inflation, has only worsened income inequality.
“What we’re seeing is that the disparity between the pay at the top and the pay at the bottom is growing greater and greater while we continue to stagnate and not raise the minimum wage,” Herman said.
He added that while increasing the wage floor is part of the solution, it is not the only solution.This nuanced issue of minimum wage is only a facet of broader social issues such as poverty, income inequality, housing and unemployment.
Dhanapatana, the only Republican on the panel, said the discussion should be refocused on improving access to affordable housing so that workers can continue to afford to live in cities, such as Los Angeles, that have a high cost of living.
“I think what we’re seeing is that the minimum wage increase seems like a great solution, in the moment,” she said. “We’re really helping out these people get back on their feet and while I don’t disagree with that, I think if we’re looking long term, we’re looking at where the money is actually going and how much [it’s] benefiting their household, then you can see that affordable housing plays a larger role in this scenario.”
Greyson Peltier, a junior majoring in business administration, said he found the event informative.
“It did get me a lot of different perspectives on the issue,” he said. “Obviously, it’s a bit more slanted because there’s only one Republican and three Democrats in the panel. It was interesting to hear about the impacts of these larger economic issues on the local community especially as it relates to housing. That’s one of the things that I was not as familiar with.”

Retired Army general and former CIA director, David Petraeus, was the spotlight of a Q&A focusing on relations with the media Wednesday afternoon in the Wallis Annenberg Lobby.
Petraeus is known for his distinguished military career, during which he served for 37 years and eventually became a decorated four-star general. After retiring from the service, President Obama nominated Petraeus to be Director of the CIA. Today, Petraeus is a partner with global investment firm KKR, and serves as chairman of KKR’s global institute.
The event was moderated by Willow Bay, director of the School of Journalism, and included Philip Seib, vice dean of Annenberg. Both Bay and Seib asked Petraeus questions regarding the media, women in the military, Syria and Afghanistan.
Obama recently announced that the United States is sending Special Operations forces into Syria. The public now questions whether ground troops will be committed to fight ISIS later on.
“I have not been one who has advised that,” Petraeus said. “Syria has evolved into a regional sectarian civil war being fought by proxies, and now even has global dimensions with the addition of Russian forces that are actively supporting Bashar Assad’s regime forces. Syria is now a geopolitical Chernobyl.”
Petraeus said the presence of advisers is insufficient to deal with the scale of conflict.
“It’s spewing violence, instability, extremism and refugees — not just in Syria, but now obviously extending into Europe,” Petraeus said. “The 50 advisors certainly won’t be enough to stop this, but they actually will have a lot more effect than people realize. They will be able to provide a level of coordination and assistance that has truly transformed the way we are fighting in Iran and in Syria.”
Syrian warfare can seem too complicated and remote for civilians to fully understand. However, this humanitarian disaster is discussed daily across various media outlets. Petraeus believes the media has three responsibilities when releasing news stories: to provide accurate facts, a degree of context and characterization, such as the implications and conclusions of certain events.
“I think that the mainstream media does a reasonably good job in discharging its responsibilities to its customers,” Petraeus said. “The problem now is this: What is the media, who is the media? Every person with a cell phone is the media. Social media is playing a much, much more significant role — everything has to be reduced to the number of characters in a Twitter message. “
Petraeus said social media intensifies competition among journalists.
“There is an intensity of scrutiny because all of these different potential media journalists are in a sense competing with one another to write a story that will rise to the top of the heap.”
In addition to the war in Syria, there is an informational war. News outlets are fighting for attention. Seib noted that 500 million Tweets are sent per day. Bay explained the ways in which Annenberg prepares its students for this battle.
“We are teaching and training and equipping students to be really prepared for today’s current technology and emerging technologies, to be mindful of the audiences that they are speaking to and to be relentlessly focused on fundamentals — accuracy, timeliness, context,” she said.
While in the military, Petraeus also focused on these fundamental aspects of communication.
“Our goal, when it came to dealing with the press, was to be first with the truth,” he said. “We literally wanted to try to beat the bad guys to the headlines. And this is tough. If you lose the headline, you then become the subtitle. There is huge pressure.”
Petraeus even considered it a military responsibility to be available to and accurate in the media.
“We worked very hard to be accessible,” Petraeus said. “It’s not my army, it’s America’s army, and America has a right to know what it’s doing and to know the thoughts of the individuals who are leading it.”
The current debate is whether or not to allow women into combat. Petraeus recalled giving a woman a bronze star and purple heart in Baghdad. She was in a sustained firefight to protect her battalion commander, but he was killed. Petraeus emphasized the importance of standards. He supports both women and LGBT individuals being allowed to enter the armed forces, as long as the force can still uphold recruiting, readiness and retention.
“It has not been a big deal,” he said. “With standards, gay guys can’t hit on other guys as much as guys can’t hit on women. There are standards of behavior that apply to everybody. So that’s the same thing you have with the expansion in more areas for women. It’s about standards of physical performance … There are a lot of guys that will not meet these standards. If a woman can meet a standard, I think we should open it up.”
Overall, military forces are made up of people who not only can attack and defend, but also understand local nation building, how to work with the locals, how to address local governance issues and how to help a country rebuild itself.
“Firms, military organizations, schools, universities, everybody needs to preserve and protect the out-of-the-box thinkers — the bomb chuckers — that are very, very useful for igniting constructive, intellectual discourse,” Petraeus said.

Undergraduate Student Government President Rini Sampath attended an invite-only convening of students and administrators on racial harassment in higher education on Wednesday in Chicago. The event was sponsored by the United States Department of Education.
In a Facebook post on Oct. 19, Sampath announced she had been invited by Under Secretary Ted Mitchell.
“We will also explore ways to create supportive and inclusive environments for students and the campus community,” She wrote in the post.
Sampath participated in a panel discussion focused on responding to racial harassment on campus moderated by Assistant Secretary for Civil Rights, Catherine E. Lhamon. Sampath stressed the importance of concerted action on the part of university administrations, without haste.
“If administrations respond too slowly, they’ll have a problem. If they respond too hastily, they’ll have a problem,” Sampath said. “It’s about finding a balance. A takeaway from that, however, was that institutions do need to respond.”
The event demonstrated that the  issues of diversity students face on USC’s campus are shared nationwide. Open and honest dialogue, Sampath said, is necessary to address the fundamental diversity problem in higher education.
“It was a great opportunity because I got to see how these problems are not unique to USC. It’s happening in institutions of higher education all over the country,” Sampath said. “We, at USC, are trying to be one of the top tier institutions, and we are lacking in resources to address these problems on our campus.”
Sampath says universities across the nation should look to each other for strategies related to diversity and that USC’s administrative infrastructure is somewhat behind. Sampath specifically referenced a presentation from the first University of California, Los Angeles Vice Chancellor for Diversity Issues, Jerry Kang, who was in attendance at the convening. The position was created by UCLA this spring.
“It’s clear [UCLA] has individuals tasked to taking care of these kinds of issues and cultivating an environment where everyone has equal opportunity at their university,” Sampath said. “We have to be looking at other institutions and wondering how we can learn from them.”
Sampath is also concerned about USC’s elimination of the diversity class requirement, which she said most attendees of the conference agreed is beneficial to opening up dialogue about diversity issues.
“I want to see how we can create more educational opportunities to address problems of diversity on campus,” Sampath said. “Regardless of how we feel about that requirement, we have a responsibility to find out how we can create more culturally competent leaders.”
The administration, she added, made progress in the last few years with acknowledging issues of racial diversity and discrimination on campus. In May 2013, when black students at USC accused the Los Angeles Police Department of racial bias after a party clash, Sampath said students were disappointed with the lack of administrators present at an open forum on the issue.
“This year, we had our provost in attendance at our town hall,” Sampath said. “It’s something we appreciated as students, but we need to see more communication and concerted effort on the administration’s part.”
The town hall she referenced was called in response to an incident in late September in which Sampath experienced racial harassment outside of a fraternity house that drew national media attention. USG has since introduced a campus climate bill that addresses diversity issues on USC’s campus. A USG Senate vote on that bill was postponed last week after a heated debate.
“The campus climate resolution has been a tremendous learning experience for all students involved,” Sampath said. “I do think some of the comments we’ve received about it should be taken into account. The whole purpose of a public forum is so that students can give feedback.”
Sampath hopes to take into account feedback particularly from students with disabilities who think the resolution should cover elements of diversity beyond race and sexual orientation. Regardless, the administration must buy in.
“This is just step one. I think there’s a misconception about how a resolution functions. It’s really up to the University as to how they want to implement it,” Sampath said. “It’s not the rule of law. It’s an opportunity for us to lay a brick. We’ve made such a remarkable effort to lay that first brick.”

When the first residents moved onto the fifth floor of Fluor Tower in the Fall 1995 semester, they became the inaugural class of Somerville Place. The newly minted African-American floor, which celebrates its 20th anniversary this week, was created to help students transition to a predominantly white institution and create a support system of belonging and retention.
Mark Pearson, who graduated from USC in 1999, lived on the floor during its first year. Pearson, now a faculty member at the Rossier School of Education, said he opted to live on the floor because he was the only black student in his classes at his high school boarding school. When he came to USC, he turned to Somerville Place to provide a different environment.
“I was literally the first person to step onto that floor,” Pearson said. “I figured that’s where a lot of black freshmen were going to be, and I wanted to be immersed.”
In Somerville Place and Pearson’s first semester, the O.J. Simpson verdict, long considered a racially divisive case, came down in Los Angeles. A few years before, the destructive civil unrest had raged around USC’s campus in response to the acquittal of four white officers on charges of beating Rodney King, a black man.
Pearson said with the advent of the floor, “no one would ever question” why it was needed.
In its 20 years, Somerville Place has served 574 students, according to numbers from the Center for Black Cultural and Student Affairs. The floor is named after John and Vada Somerville, who were social activists and black dental students in the early 1900s. On John Somerville’s first day at USC, back in 1903, his white peers presented an ultimatum to the dean saying they would resign if their black classmate were allowed to stay. Stay he did, and John, and later his wife Vada, became the first black students to graduate from the Ostrow School of Dentistry.
John Somerville’s favorite quote was, “Do not wait for your boat to come in, row out and meet it.” The floor has stayed true to its namesakes’ mission of being proactive within the black community and working to carve out a safe space for students of color at USC
On Thursday, past and current residents will come together to celebrate the legacy of the Somervilles and reflect on the accomplishments of the students who have lived on the floor. The banquet will be held in the Ronald Tutor Campus Center. Former Somerville resident and singer-songwriter Aloe Blacc, who lived on the floor from 1997-98, will perform.
Setting sail
Though the times have changed in this country since the mid-1990s, Somerville Place programming continues to address student life concerns for black students. Shernae Hughes, the current residential assistant for Somerville, said she aims to provide the resources black freshman need to feel confident and comfortable in college. Hughes lived at Somerville last year as a freshman.
“It was a very hectic year,” Hughes said. “Literally every week, two or three stories were coming out about instances of police brutality and things of that nature. I was so happy that I didn’t have to defend black humanity in my own safe space, at my place of residence, where I lived.”
The demographics on the floor are in flux. This school year, Somerville Place has 22 residents who identify as African American. Not all students who live on the fifth floor of Fluor Tower are Somerville residents. For the past three years, the floor hasn’t been completely filled with 32 black students, said Corliss Bennett-McBride, director of the CBCSA.
The Office of Admission used to sponsor a multicultural overnight weekend in April, a few weekends before final school decisions had to be made. Students said seeing how residents interacted in a familial way tipped the scales for them to attend USC. Bennett-McBride said since then, the number of African-American students on the floor has decreased.
The University no longer funds that overnight program, but the CBCSA still works to bring prospective and admitted students to see the floor.
Yet Somerville remains a place for social activism, scholarship and community service. Many of the students who lived on that floor later became Black Student Assembly presidents, Troy Camp members and National Pan-Hellenic Council leaders.
“Each floor is different,” said Bennett-McBride, who has selected 18 of the 21 cohorts of Somerville residents. “I’ve seen that it’s created a sense of belonging, professional development and whoever participates in it gets that feel that this is my home away from home.”
Further Horizons
Past residents said maintaining community among black students is essential to retention and empowerment at such a large school.
“We’ve kicked down some doors,” said Ian Chestnut, who lived on Somerville Place in Fall 1996. “I hope generations today are benefiting from those doors we kicked down and that they’re still kicking down doors for generations to come.”
Of the freshmen who entered in the Fall 2015 semester, the percentage of students who identify as African American sat at 7 percent, according to statistics from USC. This is a 1 percent increase since Fall 2012.
Yet, current resident Tola Oseni, a freshman majoring in business administration, said the diverse backgrounds of residents are welcome. On Mondays, Hughes holds “Woke Workshops,” which touch on news items involving the black community. The talks, ranging from respectability politics to colorism, are open to all. Non-black students also usually attend, Hughes said.
“It’s nice to have [non-black students] there and see that they’re understanding and trying to move forward with us as opposed to just being in the room,” Oseni said. “It’s nice to know they’re there for us.”
Like other floors in residence halls, Somerville Place receives funds from Residential Student Government, Building Government and Assistant Residential Area Supervisor I to put on events. Because of its specific mission and similar goals, Somerville RAs have also relied on the resources from the CBCSA. These include additional stipends and the time spent by Bennett-McBride and her team in executing events.
Each year, the students who pass through Somerville Place bring a different culture to the floor. However, what has stayed consistent through the years is the safe space feeling that comes with living around people who understand where you’re coming from.
“I really care about this population. It’s my family, and I need to do more for it,” Hughes said. “That’s why I got more involved in this space and BSA and the whole black community.”

Putting a lid on the goal · Senior defender Natalie Donaldson and the Women of Troy have shut out their opponents on eight different occassions heading into their last game of the regular season against UCLA. – Brian Ji | Daily Trojan
The women’s soccer team will square off against UCLA on Friday evening in the regular season finale. The crosstown rivalry game will be played in enemy territory for the Trojans.
Both USC and UCLA traveled north this past weekend to take on Stanford and Cal.
The Women of Troy fell to the Cardinal 1-0 before defeating the Golden Bears, 1-0. Meanwhile, the Bruins came up empty on their road trip, losing to Cal 7-0 and losing to Stanford 2-0.
The Cal game was certainly one to forget for the Bruins. The Golden Bears seized the momentum and ran with it, leaving UCLA searching for answers.
UCLA’s 8-9-1 record may not look terribly impressive, but their strength of schedule is as good as it gets. In addition to playing in the grueling Pac-12, UCLA has taken on Wisconsin, Virginia, Texas, Wake Forest, North Carolina and Pepperdine.
A win over USC would bring UCLA to .500 on the season. It would also salvage what has been a mediocre season for UCLA  by program standards. The Bruins won the national title in 2013 and looked to be one of the favorites heading into this season.
However, with two losses in its two games, UCLA has slipped during the latter part of the season.
The Trojans, ranked No. 14 in the country, look to be the clear favorite in this matchup. The crosstown schools have one of the best rivalries in all of collegiate athletics.
Additionally, Friday’s game is Senior Night for UCLA.
There is also something to be said for having nothing to lose. The Bruins do not have a tremendous amount of pressure on their shoulders and could very well come out playing free-flowing soccer on Friday night.
Sometimes a team’s record is not an accurate reflection of the talent level present. UCLA is not used to losing this many games in a season. In fact, UCLA is not used to losing at all.
Last season, the Bruins did not lose a single game until the NCAA quarterfinals when they fell to Virginia 2-1. This same core group of players went 21-1-2 a year ago.
Though the stats, facts, figures and projections lean heavily toward USC in this contest, recent history has its own rebuttal. In 2011, the Bruins clobbered the Women of Troy, 5-2. In 2013, during UCLA’s run to the national championship, the Bruins cruised to a 4-1 victory over USC.
Last season, the Bruins came out on top, defeating USC 2-0 at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum.
The 2015 USC team is a different animal, though.
Head coach Keidane McAlpine is now in his second season and has his team absolutely humming.
While the Trojans have been dominant on offense, the defense has been stout throughout the season.
The team has lost a meager five games on the season, never allowing more than two goals in a game and never losing by more than one goal.
This back four does not make mental errors, as all four defenders are visibly locked in at all times.
Diligent defending from center backs Dominique Randle and Ally Prisock has enabled outside backs like Kayla Mills to push forward and join in on attacking movements.
The outstanding play of goalkeeper Sammy Jo Prudhomme has only added to this feeling of stability at the back. USC’s keeper is coming off of another clean sheet. She made five saves in the 1-0 win at Cal and has been integral to the team’s success with her shot stopping and distribution.
The 2015 edition of this historic crosstown rivalry will take place on Friday night at 6 p.m. at UCLA’s Drake Stadium.

Ball hogs · Sophomore JuJu Smith-Schuster and the Trojans have won the time-of-possession battle in each of its last three games. – Mariya Dondonyan | Daily Trojan
The Trojans had another tough, physical practice on Wednesday. Interim head coach Clay Helton continued to emphasize the competition that the players have with each other in practice to better prepare for situations during a live game.
“Love the effort these kids are playing with right now,” Helton said. “The defensive unit has really come together, and it’s been neat to watch them.”
The strong effort — especially from the defense — has made an impact during the game. The defense has produced six interceptions in their last two games — doubling the number from the first half of the season.
Against Cal, sophomore cornerback Adoree’ Jackson grabbed a pick-six and senior cornerback Kevon Seymour had an interception in the fourth quarter.
Defensive coordinator Justin Wilcox applauded the individual performances from Jackson and Seymour, but he also emphasized the team’s involvement on the plays.
Wilcox credits the defensive turnaround in the second half of the season to a focus on technique and attention to detail. He said that the defense is improving across the board.
“Guys are making strides and showing progress at different positions,” Wilcox said. “We expect that to continue.”
Looking toward Arizona, Wilcox knows that his players will need to continue to focus on their technique and mental intensity to handle the tempo of the Wildcats’ offense.
“Ultimately it comes down to the execution of the play,” Wilcox said. “We’ve been better in that area.”
One of the keys to the team turning it around in the second half has been Helton’s focus on togetherness.
Redshirt sophomore safety Chris Hawkins noted that Helton has made the team into a real family, especially with the Tuesday night family dinners.
“You want to play for one another,” Hawkins said. “You don’t want to let your brothers down.”
In practices, Helton encourages the players to constantly be competitive with each other to mirror game situations.
“The competition we bring against one another helps us on the field,” Hawkins said. “We compete at the highest ability.”
Sophomore wide receiver JuJu Smith-Schuster  underwent surgery on Monday to repair his fractured hand. He was at practice Wednesday morning in a cast supporting his team.
“I consider him Superman, so it wouldn’t shock me if all of a sudden Thursday or Friday he says, ‘Coach, I’m ready.’”
Smith-Schuster’s ability to play will be dependent on pain tolerance. Helton is planning on not having Smith-Schuster available to play, but he’s still waiting to see.
With various injuries to the wide receiver corps, USC has had to utilize its depth. Freshman wide receiver Deontay Burnett has stepped up for the Trojans after he recorded three catches for a team-high 82 yards against Cal — the second most on the team. Helton has been impressed with Burnett’s effort and work ethic.
“That light comes on a lot quicker for guys who pour themselves into the craft,” Helton said.
A focus on family and technique has kept the Trojans effective and successful on the field. They will once again have their work cut out for them on Saturday. If they beat the Wildcats, they will remain in the race to win the Pac-12 South.

The College Football Playoff Committee unveiled its first CFP rankings of the year Tuesday night. The committee had its hands full with 11 undefeated teams — compared to just three last year — and several other one-loss teams with impressive resumes.
But that is why the NCAA decided to switch from the BCS to the CFP. To make sure that humans were making the decisions based on the eye test, strength of schedule and quality of wins.
The BCS system showed too much favoritism to teams from Power Five conferences — especially the SEC. There was  even a year when two SEC teams played for the NCAA Championship despite there being several other qualified teams.
Last year, the committee got it right by picking Ohio State over Baylor and TCU. The committee was hit with harsh criticism by picking the Buckeyes, who had a relatively soft schedule, over the one-loss Texas programs, but in the end, the decision turned out to be the choice.
The CFP was a success on all levels in year one.
Unfortunately, it appears that year two may be retreading into the same bad habits that plagued the BCS system: SEC bias.
When the committee released its first poll of the season, many were shocked to see two SEC teams ranked in the top 4 — undefeated LSU and one-loss Alabama. In fact, the committee’s top 25 is almost completely different than the AP Top 25.
The Committee’s top 10: Clemson, LSU, Ohio State, Alabama, Notre Dame, Baylor, Michigan State, TCU, Iowa and Florida.
The AP Top 10: Ohio State, Baylor, Clemson, LSU, TCU, Michigan State, Alabama, Notre Dame, Stanford and Iowa.
If the College Football Playoff started today, the two Big 12 representatives would be left out once again. The committee actually ranked two one-loss teams — ’Bama and Notre Dame — ahead of the likes of undefeated Baylor, Michigan State, TCU and Iowa.
The other four undefeated teams — Memphis, Oklahoma State, Toledo and Houston were left out of the top 10 altogether.
The team that may have the most outcry at being left out of the top 10 is Memphis. The Tigers are one of two undefeated American Athletic Conference teams, but own one of the best wins of the season — a 13-point victory over Ole Miss.
That’s the same Ole Miss team that went into Tuscaloosa and beat the Crimson Tide with ease. It appears that the committee was way off in its decision-making this year.
This season has been full of surprises, and the committee could have quite the decision to make come the end of the season. There is a strong possibility that each Power 5 conference could boast a one-loss conference champion.
The Pac-12 is already guaranteed a one-loss champion. Alabama and LSU will square off this weekend, but if Ole Miss wins out they would be the West representatives in the SEC Championship game with two losses.
The Rebels would then surely face off against Florida for the championship, leaving a one-loss Alabama team at home.
In the Big 12, Oklahoma, Oklahoma State, TCU and Baylor all have to play each other. Assuming each of these teams beat up on each other, there could be a tie for first in the conference once again.
Having no championship game could come back to haunt the conference for a second consecutive year.
Ohio State still has to play both Michigan and Michigan State and then possibly undefeated Iowa in the Big 10 championship game. If Clemson can escape with a win over Florida State this weekend they will have the best chance of being an undefeated conference champion.
Now for the non-Big 5 conferences, it comes down to Houston, Notre Dame and Memphis. Houston and Memphis will square off later this month with the winner surely ending the season undefeated. Notre Dame has a late season showdown against Stanford.
In this hypothetical situation, the committee could be looking at a one-loss Utah, a two-loss SEC champion Ole Miss, a one-loss Alabama, a one-loss TCU, a one-loss Big 10 champion Ohio State, an undefeated Clemson, an undefeated Memphis or Houston and a one-loss Notre Dame for four playoff spots.
How fast until the media and fans start calling for eight teams if that situation arises?
Maybe Pat Haden made the right choice by stepping down from the committee. I sure wouldn’t want to be making that choice.

Back for more · Senior outside hitter Alex Slaught recorded a team-best 284 kills in 2015, to go along with 121 digs, which contributed to him being named All-MPSF honorable mention. – Brian Ji | Daily Trojan
After a less than stellar first taste as the head coach of USC men’s volleyball in a fall tournament last month, Jeff Nygaard will look for an improved performance on Thursday in another early exhibition game against Hawai’i.
Nygaard, who was announced as the program head coach this past June, won’t have to coach his first official match until the Trojan’s season opener against Penn State in January, but the matchup against Hawai’i will be another chance for the Trojans to see where they are in their fall training program.
The team lost one of its best players in program history in setter Micah Christenson, who graduated in the spring. Christenson is a member of the U.S. Men’s national team and was key to the Trojans’ offense.
The Trojans face one of the premier programs in Hawai’i, who advanced to the NCAA national championship tournament last year. The team is looking to advance to the NCAA tournament for the first time since the 2012-2013 season.
At the fall tournament earlier this year on Oct. 25, the Trojans dropped all four of their matches against Concordia, UCLA, UC Santa Barbara and Cal State Northridge.
USC was the only team at the tourney to go winless, while their crosstown rivals went 3-1.
Nygaard took over the USC program after athletic director Pat Haden announced that former head coach Bill Ferguson would not return last May.
Ferguson went 150-102 during his nine seasons at USC including three trips to the NCAA chamionships.
Last season, Ferguson’s team went 19-9 and finished 2015 as the No. 7 ranked team in the nation. The program, however, finished in the bottom half of the MPSF in the two years prior.
The match against Hawai’i starts at 7 p.m. in the Galen Center.
What do you expect from a former ‘ruin who was a main part of the program problems the last few years. Another great search by Haden in finding a new Coach for the team. There is a definite lack of talent w/o Christenson and Feathers who graduated, and
no height at the outside positions. Losing to Concordia takes the cake. Nowhere to go but up after that  performance.

In sports it’s often said that winning can cure any problem, and USC has won its last two games. Players say that it’s been this team’s embracement of interim head coach Clay Helton’s philosophy of being a family that has saved USC’s season.After the dramatic departure of coach Steve Sarkisian, Helton preached to his players that the only way they were going to get through their rigorous Pac-12 schedule was if they relied on one another. Though the season looked grim then, Helton was optimistic about USC’s future since his first day as head coach, saying that if USC started to play collective football as a family they could go on an “epic” run and win the Pac-12.
“He’s great. He’s one of those guys who is just so positive. He’s one of those people who never seems to be having a bad day — or if he is, you would never know it,” defensive coordinator Justin Wilcox said after practice Wednesday. “He really knows how to lead. He has got a lot of energy. I’ve always been grateful for the great relationship we’ve had.”
United by one goal, USC players and coaches have rallied around Helton’s positive message of relying on one another. This can be seen on the practice field, where players have been given longer water breaks in between drills. Since Sarkisian’s departure, players socialize with other players of their same position and coaches more. And, they appear to have a lot of fun as they discuss technique and strategy.
“I think that we are just coming together as a group more, and we’re becoming a much more balanced and efficient team,” said cornerback Adoree’ Jackson. “Since Helton got here — with all the stuff going on — he told us that he is going to take care of us.”
In recent games, the USC defense played much more collectively against Utah and Cal as evidenced by when they were visibly swarming the ball carriers and making more group tackles. Similarly, USC’s offense has had to rely on each other in the wake of key injuries to starting offensive linemen and receivers. USC players say that they’ve been revitalized by Helton’s teaching that if they play together, the wins will come.
“He is such a positive coach, man,” redshirt senior defensive tackle Delvon Simmons said.  “And we’re all buying into what he is selling, and I think that it has really helped us. We all want to work hard for him and get it done for him.”
USC coaches and players say that the family dynamic Helton has built on the field stems from his effort to get to know every member of the team. Since his first practice, the offensive-minded Helton has equally divided his attention between the offense, defense and special teams so that he can get a “feel” for every decision of the game. Sophomore safety Chris Hawkins said that Helton has helped the defensive secondary by spending a lot of time during film installing USC’s next opponent’s playing style in the scout-team offense, so that after they’re scrimmaging in practice, they’re better prepared for the games.
“Coach Helton told us that he is watching us and cares for us, and I know that he’s been working with the offensive scout team to get us right,” Hawkins said. “He’s been teaching us the tendencies of opposing quarterbacks and defenses. So, he has really been coaching on both sides of the ball.”
Hawkins added that the team has spent a lot more time together off the field at events that Helton started, like Tuesday night team dinners, in which coaches and players invite their families for barbecue. Consequently, Hawkins said that USC’s play has come off as more “put together” and “like a team.” Wilcox echoed Hawkins’ sentiment, as his defense has been filling gaps and collecting tackles as much more of a combined unit. Wilcox added that his trusting relationship with Helton has allowed him and his defense to execute his game plan in their past two wins.
“I think that team-wise, the more that you can do together, it is always beneficial,” Wilcox said. “You just put so much  time and hours in. And we spend so much time on meetings and in practices working on X’s and O’s and technique and scheme and all of these things. But we have really started to see that these young guys are building that camaraderie and chemistry and that has led to a lot of success for us.”
In practice, Helton can be seen lining up as a defensive back and running with receivers in order to coach them through their routes. He’s gotten into three-point stances with the linemen in order to emphasize technique and physicality. And, he’s inspected countless field goals with Alex Wood and the special teams. Helton said he’s learned that in order to be a good coach and see progression in his team, he has to listen to his players.
“I want to be on both sides of the ball,” Helton said. “I think that as a head coach the whole team has to feel you at every position, and I want to make sure that I am part of that defensive structure because they have to know that you care and they have to know that you have their best interest at heart. They have got to feel your passion for them.”
The support Helton has received to remain the head coach after the season from the entire team has exemplified that USC players have responded to his message of being a family and are drawn by Helton’s positive demeanor. Quarterback Cody Kessler, who has had a long relationship with Helton, his one-time quarterbacks coach, says that the team and him are playing as hard as they can to not only win, but also to support their new head coach. And because Helton has been “100 percent real in practice, every day,” the whole team trusts and enjoys playing for him.
“Coach Helton has been a genuine guy to me since day one,” Kessler said. “He hasn’t changed, and that is something you really look [for] in a coach.”
Helton has repeatedly called the USC head coaching job his dream job and calls himself “the luckiest man in the world for the chance to represent USC in the Coliseum on Saturdays.” Understandably, Helton says that he’s been extremely “humbled” by how his players have embraced his message of playing as a family and winning because of it.
“It is very humbling. It shows you probably the number one thing that I’ve learned in this entire experience — how important relationships are in this business,” Helton said. “Those relationships between coach and players are invaluable. I want them to know that I have the utmost trust in them, and I know that I have their trust. And when you have that, you are going to be a very cohesive football team.”
USC’s two straight wins were largely fueled by significant contributions from freshman and sophomore players. Helton attributes the younger players’ ability to step up in these situations to new 45-minute Monday practices, which he added a week before the Notre Dame game. Helton said he created Monday practices for a chance to give the redshirt freshmen and players who do play in games extra reps to develop their fundamentals, while the veterans watch film and get some much-needed rest to combat the physically grueling season.
“As we rally together as a Trojan family during a hard time, you’ll see the true character of what Trojans are made of,” Helton said in his  introductory press conference.
Since then, USC has put itself into prime position to accomplish the same goal they’ve had all year long — win the Pac-12. And under Helton, both sides of the ball have looked much more efficient and confident to win out.

Let your cooking skills run libre and celebrate National Nacho Day on Friday. The classic Tex-Mex dish serves as a simple snack or even a hearty meal for hungry college students to make on a budget. With thousands of different combinations available, nachos are sure to satisfy any palate. The following recipes provide a classic take and a holiday twist on this delicious meal.
Classic Beef Nachos
The secret to classic beef nachos comes from the oven. Baking nachos in the oven adds a crispy touch to otherwise dull tortillas. The way the cheese melts bringing all of the ingredients together creates a delicious mixture of flavors. This dish can range anywhere from mild to extra hot depending on preference.
-1 pound ground beef
-16-ounce can refried beans
-15 ounces corn tortilla chips
-2 cups shredded Cheddar cheese
-1 onion, finely diced
-1/2 cups sour cream
-1 sliced jalapeño pepper, to taste
-Salt and pepper, to taste
Serves 6. Active: 25 minutes; total: 40 minutes.
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees and lightly grease a 12×12-inch baking dish. Brown the ground beef with onion, salt and pepper in a large frying pan over medium heat and be sure to break the meat into very small pieces before draining the grease once the meat is cooked. Then place the refried beans in a saucepan over medium heat and stir until they are sufficiently heated up. Arrange half the chips and 1/2 cup of the cheese at the bottom of the greased baking dish. Layer the refried beans over the chips and sprinkle another 1/2 cup of cheese on top of the beans. Spread the sour cream over the second layer of cheese and the ground beef over the sour cream. Top the ground beef with the rest of the chips followed by 1 cup of cheese. If preferred, add jalapeño pepper on top to taste. Bake in preheated oven until the cheese melts thoroughly.
Loaded Vegetarian Nachos
This hearty meat-free recipe is a fairly healthy approach to this classic dish. With black beans and refried beans as well as heaps of cheese, there is plenty of protein to go around. Vegetarians and
non-vegetarians alike will surely be left licking their fingers.
-5 cups tortilla chips
-2 cups of shredded Monterey Jack cheese
-1 avocado, diced
-1 Roma tomato, diced
-1/2 cup canned black beans
-1/2 cup refried beans
-1/3 cup corn kernels
-1/4 cup green chiles
-Pickled jalapeños, to taste
Serves 4. Active: 10 minutes; total: 20 minutes.
Preheat the oven to 375 degrees and lightly grease an 8×8-inch baking dish. Spread the tortilla chips in the greased dish and top with avocado, beans, cheese, corn, green chiles and tomato. Place into the oven and bake until the cheese has thoroughly melted. If desired, serve with pickled jalapeños.
Thanksgiving Leftover Nachos
Now that it is November, the time has come to celebrate Thanksgiving. So, put a festive twist on this delicious northern Mexican dish. This combination of holiday sweetness mixed with vibrant spice comes together to form an unforgettable and delicious recipe.
-16 ounces tortilla chips
-2 cups shredded Cheddar cheese
-1 pound chopped turkey breast
-16-ounce can of refried beans
-1 cup cranberry sauce
-2 tablespoons chopped fresh cilantro
-2 tablespoons lime juice
-2 jalapeño peppers
-1 green onion, sliced
-Salt, to taste
-Sour cream, to taste
Serves: 8. Active: 10 minutes; total: 20 minutes.
Preheat oven to 425 degrees and lightly grease a 13×13-inch baking pan.
Arrange a layer of tortilla chips at the bottom of the baking pan and sprinkle 1 cup of cheese on top. Layer more tortilla chips on top of the cheese and place half of the
pre-cooked turkey over the chips. Top the first layer of turkey evenly with the refried beans followed by the remaining turkey. Layer the rest of the tortilla chips on top of the turkey followed by the remaining 1 cup of cheese spread evenly over the chips. Bake five to 10 minutes until the cheese is thoroughly melted. While the tortilla chips are baking, prepare the cranberry-jalapeño salsa by mixing the cranberry sauce, cilantro and lime juice in a small bowl. Seed and finely dice one jalapeño pepper, stir it into the salsa and add salt to taste. Slice the remaining jalapeño and arrange it evenly over the baked nachos along with sliced green onion. Serve with salsa and sour cream to taste.

Michelle Payne was the first female jockey ever to win the Melbourne Cup.
Fascinators and ties were the dress code as the country stood still for a day to celebrate the culmination of Australian horse racing at the Melbourne Cup. As one of the biggest events in the Australian sports calendar, the Melbourne Cup is also one of the most important events on the global horse racing scene. It was the first time I had ever attended a horse race, and the event definitely exceeded my expectations.
This year, the Cup was especially exciting as Michelle Payne was the first female jockey ever to take home the gold trophy along with $6.2 million in prize money. Witnessing such a historic event enhanced the experience, as Payne’s win was an important milestone in horse racing history. The racing, though, was hardly the only factor demanding attention that day.
The Melbourne Cup brings together people from all over to Flemington Racecourse to celebrate with friends, show off their race style and bet on their favorite horses. Spirits run high throughout the track. People of all ages and backgrounds enjoy picnics on the lawn in the general admission area, as they toast with plastic champagne glasses. Meanwhile, tents and members’ areas invite dedicated and higher-price ticket holders into the stands to watch the 10 races sponsored by a variety of companies. The main race — the Melbourne Cup race seven — happens later in the day.
What fascinated me was the fashion — it was probably one of the most distinctive aspects of the entire experience. Leading up to the event, almost every large retail shop displays wide brimmed hats, creative fascinator headpieces (think Kate Middleton) and crowns, enticing shoppers to pick out a perfect headpiece to go with their outfit. Store windows  show off pieces in their collections, specifically drawing customers to find their headpiece for spring racing season or to be Melbourne Cup ready. Planning the perfect Cup outfit takes precision and the ensembles that people wear to the event demonstrated the dedication that people had, going above and beyond the call of fashion.
Though several women opted for fascinators with bows, flowers, bright colors or mesh attachés reminiscent of the headpieces worn during the royal wedding, others wore large hats or floral crowns. Some people even took the time to make themselves impressive headwear, incorporating painted wood pieces and feathers or, in some cases even fresh flowers. The headwear, though, merely complemented the range of outfits that people wore. Vibrant colors played a dominant role, as spring fashion trends matched the spirit of the daytime lawn party. I opted for a gold leaf crown to go along with my white dress, to aim for a minimalistic look.
Meanwhile, the men also brought their best looks out with impressive suits. In fact, some of the most astounding outfits were worn by men, including a suit covered in cheetah print and top hats topped with race horse statues. Clearly, the fashion was just as important to the event as were the races.
Betting, in particular, was very popular among attendees with totals reaching well into the millions in the pools and prizes, which included trips to Paris. What I found particularly interesting at the event was the absence of commercials on TV bearing the message to gamble responsibly. Usually, these commercials are pretty standard at horse racing events, but they took a break during the Melbourne Cup, which resembles a public holiday.
And a public holiday it is. During this day, the entire country comes to a stop as banks, retail stores, medical centers and eateries close. The excitement spreads around the city leading up to the event, as Melbourne boasts its host status of such a prestigious occasion.
Studying in Melbourne this semester allowed me to take part in this memorable holiday that remains at the core of the city that has been my home for the past couple of months. I would have never expected that the first horse race I would attend would be down under.

Whole Foods Market officially opened their new location, at the corner of Grand Avenue and 8th Street in downtown Los Angeles, Wednesday. Though the commute will be a little farther, Whole Foods might be a good option for USC students who are disappointed about the upcoming closing of Fresh & Easy on Figueroa Street.
Whole Foods is like a sustainable, hip version of Costco, with just as much variety but more organic options. The walls are covered with quotes in cute typography. During the opening booths were set up for samples ranging from cold pressed juices to chips and guacamole. Live music set the atmosphere for customers as well.
The organic food paradise featured music from local band Puddles Pity Party, with Puddles, the lead singer, dressed as a large clown. Standing seven feet tall and singing cabaret, Puddles is impossible to miss and added a unique style to the Whole Foods grand opening. After his set, he walked around the marketplace greeting customers.
In addition to its wide array of vegetables, the newly opened store also features a juice bar with many types of cold pressed juices, including the popular “green juices,” usually made with apple and kale.
“One of the hot trends is cold pressed, and many people ask us how the process works,” said Julio Garcia, one of the product managers of Whole Foods.
Garcia represented the helpful workers in the market, as he delved into the difference between cold press and regular juicing. According to Garcia, the process entails going into a room that’s under 45 degrees in temperature while putting the product into a cloth bag. Then, a machine uses more than 25,000 pounds of pressure to squeeze out the product. This process collects a concentrated amount of juice, with no loss of nutrients.
Customers will be impressed by the amount of vegan options in every department, the poke bar and the coffee bar. Eight Bar, a restaurant and bar next to and owned by the grocery store, contains brunch menus as well as wine and cocktail menus.
Other features will certainly excite organic enthusiasts and health buffs. People will find the multiple varieties for cosmetics, food and household products. For a more convenient option, Instacart, a company that delivers groceries to homes, partnered with Whole Foods to promote their venture of delivering fresh foods to Los Angeles residents.
At the heart of it, Whole Foods prides itself on being local and helping small businesses in the area. Additionally, the grocery store always promises fresh and sustainable fruits and vegetables, without preservatives or artificial flavors.
The Whole Foods Market grand opening resembled a carnival. People of all ages and backgrounds will easily be enamored by the high quality. Ultimately, people who do not even subscribe to the organic foods lifestyle will be intrigued by the functionality and flair that Whole Foods presents.

Los Angeles — a city well-known to many, but yet do they really see what lies beneath many of the tourist attractions? It’s now a city filled with homeless individuals and families occupying sidewalks and freeway underpasses.  A state of emergency was declared in Los Angeles on Sept. 22, Los Angeles is the only city to take such a critical step toward addressing the growing issue of homelessness. Since 2013, there has been a 12 percent increase totaling nearly 26,000 homeless individuals and families, 18,000 of which are unsheltered.
Mayor Eric Garcetti has pledged to spend $100 million on housing services. This is a positive step for Los Angeles leadership. However, the mayor has yet to say where this money will be coming from and what particular services will be funded. These are fundamental questions that need to be answered. The longer the wait for action, the greater the issue becomes.
Unlike many other urban cities such as New York, a vast majority of the homeless individuals are unsheltered. One of the main contributions of unsheltered homeless individuals is the lack of affordable housing in the Los Angeles area. Many of the people receiving housing vouchers are unable to cover their total rental costs. The issue at hand is the lack of affordable and sustainable resources.
There have been many resources allocated for these individuals, but the question on the table: Are the offered resources sustainable? Let’s take for example the Tiny Home Project. This project provided homeless individuals a mobile house that was the size of a doghouse which were placed on public streets. Many of the individuals were grateful for the roof over their heads, but admitted they need more space and lacked basic amenities. This project targets one of the needs which was providing a roof over their heads, but they still lacked bathrooms and storage spaces. This project created controversy among community members. On one hand, locals were concerned with their safety because many of these come from diverse backgrounds such as mental illness, previous offenders and substance abusers to name a few. On the other hand, community advocates felt that dog houses were not sustainable. These individuals lacked basic necessities and amenities such as a bathroom, kitchen and storage space.
With that being said, there are many resources being offered on a macro level, which cannot meet the basic needs on an individual level. There are many options being proposed, but community needs to support. One of those options involves finding individuals who are willing to either donate land to the community or the city buys a plot of land to build homes for individuals similar to the mobile-home park layout. The second option would be to work with landlords and have critical discussions regarding the stigmatization of section 8 housing candidates. It is critical that we break these barriers which prohibit these individuals from receiving affordable housing. I stress the need for community support because in order to address the growing issue there must be community buy in.
We can only blame community leaders to a certain extent. It takes people power to create an action plan and follow through with it. It is our job as a community to implement action steps and advocate for the need of sustainable housing.
Justice has not been served until all homeless individuals are treated with dignity and compassion by our community and elected officials. Justice isn’t served until homeless victims are informed of all their rights throughout the justice process — rights that empower them, give them important choices, and offer them opportunities to have voices and choices in their cases and in their future. In Los Angeles, we can be “bystanders” to justice, or we can recognize that justice for one person who is affected by homelessness  is truly justice for us all. If you or someone you know is concerned about justice and safety in our community, you can help out by volunteering and advocating for homeless assistance programs.

Who is in place to adjudicate “justice” for the homeless? A city like LA has millions of people with diverse interests. There are many specials interests that compete for the taxpayers dollars. Unless the homeless become more powerful than the local unions, government unions, or sports teams they cannot expect to get the same lavish treatment. Unfortunately, the homeless are not large campaign contributors, as such they will be treated as second class citizens.

As much as USC students dread midterms and detest 8 a.m. classes, most are grateful for the opportunity to further their education. Now, if they imagine life where college was not an option financially, their future shifts dramatically. This is the mentality of foster children nationwide who are often more focused on how they will support themselves and secure a living wage job by the time they “age out” of foster care on their 18th birthday than getting a college education.
Approximately two-thirds of foster students do not attend college, and very few graduate. Even if they do choose to attend college, these students do not have the strong support system that a family provides during their turbulent first year away. Burdened with an enormous debt from tuition on top of this lack of support, many foster students drop out of college midway through their freshman year. If foster children went to college at the same rate as their peers, there would be 100,000 more foster youth enrolled in secondary education, according to Foster Care to Success.
Arizona has taken an incredible step toward helping foster children in this situation. Two years ago, former Gov. Jan Brewer signed a bill granting free tuition for foster children at community colleges and state universities. Since then, enrollment of foster students in these universities has increased by 40 percent at Arizona State University, according to a university official. More than 3,500 13-17 year olds were in the Arizona foster system in 2014, which means that more than 700 of these students will soon “age out” of foster care.
With this bill in place, college is finally a feasible option for many former foster youth. Evidence suggests that further help will follow the grants. For example, program staff working at Arizona State University donated school supplies, toiletries and bedding to foster children who showed up at the school empty-handed.
It is vital that USC follow in Arizona State’s footsteps by providing free college tuition to foster children who age out of the system. In California alone, there are approximately 60,000 foster youth, a large percentage of whom will face adverse circumstances once they age out of the system. Investing in education is, hands down, the most effective way of reducing these obstacles. Higher education, which we often take for granted, could completely change students’ lives for the better. Foster youth “experience homelessness, incarceration, dependence on public assistance, unemployment and out-of-wedlock parenthood at disproportionately higher rates than their same-age peers,” according to Foster Care to Success. Thus, the cost to the state for free tuition would be less than the cost of the state-funded welfare programs that many of these foster children would be forced to rely on without an education.
Furthermore, because former foster children are statistically more likely to develop substance addiction, incarceration and medical costs will ultimately surpass tuition costs as well. From 1987 to 2007, national spending on incarceration increased by 127 percent, while spending on higher education saw only a 21 percent increase, according to Foster Care to Success. Overall, states spend four times more on incarceration alone than education, a statistic that could be altered if more foster children are educated.
It is also important to consider the social benefits that programs like these can have. Foster children move from home to home and school to school without making lasting friendships. The chance to attend college for four continuous years without interruption would allow these students to make perhaps their first true connections with both peers and faculty. This supportive network will encourage former foster children to enjoy college so that a higher percentage of them will remain in school until graduation.
Many of the positive effects from free tuition programs can already be seen. ASU reports that many students in its Bridging Success program are high-achieving and aspire to become leaders. Graduating from USC with no tuition debt via a program like Bridging Success, foster youth would have a far brighter future.  An education at USC will equip these students with the skills, knowledge and Trojan Family connections to secure a well-paying job and start a better life for themselves and for their future children. This is how we can begin to break the cycle of poverty and neglect.
Thank you so much for posting this article. This needs to be discussed more. I will reach out to you about this topic.
USC already has MANY ways to get free tuition.
Hi Natalie,
You have to realize USC is a private university whereas ASU is a public university.  Nothing is free in life.  Arizona taxpayers will have to pay for ASU’s generous plan.  Do you want your tuition increased to cover foster children’s “free tuition” if they go to USC?  Someone will have to pay for it.
True but is ASU dealing with billions of dollars in the budget and surely less than 1% of its population ( roughly 20 students right now ) needing 200k over the course of 4 years? Let me simplify and scale. 200000 to 1,000,000,000 is about $2 to $10,000. USC has a 5.6 billion dollar endowment and there are 20 students. SO 200,000 x 20 = 4million dollars or in this scale about 40$ compared to the 10000 or in this case the 1000,000,000 x 5.6 {bil} = 5.6 billion dollars or in this scale $56,000. All these kids need is 40$ over the course of 4 years from budget ($120 ). Yes that means foster youth only would need 120$ out of $224,000 because 56000 x4 = 222400 . Is 40 dollars a year out of 56000 too much to change 20 amazing trojan lives? Thats hardly a dent in the budget at all and these are the most vulnerable people in our society because they usually only have themselves.
Stanford (sucks) pays for anyone who makes less than like 115+ or something. thats a california private school we should be shitting on. Foster youth start off with 0.

Calling all avocado lovers! Not only do these green super foods taste good, but they also are extremely good for you. Avocados reduce your risk for heart disease and cancer, and help you maintain weight and healthy skin and eyes. And what better way to eat avocados than on toast? Here are top five spots to find avocado toast in Los Angeles.
Located just a short trip from USC, Zinc is a great brunch spot offering all of the breakfast classics –– including made-to-order avocado toast.

On a whiteboard behind my desk in the Daily Trojan newsroom, there are tally marks indicating the number of corrections we’ve printed in the DT this semester: currently 11. Each one pains me, as though the marks were written with Professor Umbridge’s special quill, but they serve as a constant reminder of one of the unfortunate realities of journalism: Mistakes happen.
On any given day, through the eyes and ears of my reporters, I can attend a lecture by a former White House press secretary, watch a demonstration on campus or learn that former Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger is, indeed, back.  My goal is to ensure that all our readers can experience these events too. As Jef Mallett said, “Writing well means never having to say, ‘I guess you had to be there.’”
My desire for thorough, accurate reporting runs headlong into the reality of printing deadlines. I’ve lost count of the days that I have thought it would be the first time the paper didn’t go to press. Things always have a way of working out, but the deadline pressure is ever present. Working against time, my co-editor Sebastian and I are responsible for reporting the news in a manner that is quick, engaging, and, above all, accurate. Each story gets read as many times and by as many different people as possible. We have an entire section, Copy, dedicated to fact-checking. Anything that can be confirmed is, but many times we have to trust our reporters in the field, and even the most stringent systems fail occasionally. 
The need for accuracy is due in part to the prestige of our University. Celebrities, politicians and other high-profile figures frequent the campus and have reputations to maintain. Carelessness in reporting is not only unprofessional — it can have serious repercussions. 
Earlier this year, there was an incident involving a former official who asked for an article about his visit to campus be removed, citing errors and mischaracterizations of his remarks that would be damaging to his career. An audio recording of his talk revealed that he had not been misquoted as he claimed, but there were factual errors that were corrected. 
This incident and others demonstrate the power that journalists have with their words and why each tally mark on our board irks me — each one represents a dereliction of our primary duty as journalists: To seek the truth. 
I dread receiving emails, sometimes angry ones, about errors in our articles and I loathe having to run corrections in print — but I’ve come to accept that as part of the game. The sanctity of print journalism comes from its indelible nature — once something is printed, it can’t be undone. You can edit a blog post or delete tweets in seconds, but you can’t shred 10,000 copies of the DT easily. We stand by our work, and when mistakes happen, we acknowledge and take steps to rectify them.

There are many ways to take advantage of your study abroad semester, just as blogger Janis Yue has done in Bilbao. Janis Yue | Daily Trojan

Scanning through social media, it’s very easy to believe that studying abroad is only made up of positive experiences. While exploring the world away from home can be beautiful, impactful and overall a priceless experience, it’s important to know that creating a good study abroad experience doesn’t always come without active effort. There are lows and bad days no matter where you are in the world, but there are specific steps that you can take while studying abroad in order to have as many good days as possible.
Here is a list of dos and don’ts of study abroad to have the best experience possible. While everyone seeks a different study abroad story, here are six lessons that I’ve personally learned that could help improve other people’s journeys:
Do’s
1. Do remember to stay in your designated study abroad city some weekends. Many people see studying abroad as being a once in a lifetime opportunity to go to every major city within a reasonable distance. While there are many awesome benefits to traveling as a student, don’t forget to get to know the city you’re studying in and really create a home away from home. Maintain a balance of breadth and depth. Some of the best weekends I’ve had studying abroad have been spent just relaxing with my host family in Bilbao.
2.  Ask for a local opinion. Though it might be uncomfortable at first, asking locals where to go (to eat, drink or just hang out) really is the best way to gain special tips about the city. Or you might even learn the quickest way to get to the grocery store. Locals have told me things to do that are off the beaten path, such as hiking the San Juan de Gaztelugatxe (pictured above) on the coast of the Basque Country. It’s easy to turn to your phone for information without having to engage in human interaction, but asking locals is generally more informative and faster. It’s a great way to practice your language as well if you’re learning one.
3. Do remember that you are indeed incredibly and marvelously blessed to be having this experience! It’s one that not everyone is lucky enough to have.
Don’ts
1. Don’t expect to become completely fluent in a new language, especially without actively taking steps to improve. I came to Spain with the idea that within a few weeks I would be able to understand every conversation and speak like a local. Even after eight weeks, it’s becoming more and more clear that Spanish will always be a work in progress for me. What’s more, is that just being in Spain doesn’t mean that I’ll automatically pick up Spanish. While I am improving significantly, taking an active approach by watching TV in Spanish instead of English, listening to Spanish music and having conversations with American friends in Spanish are crucial to improvement.
2. Don’t spend too much time on social media or talking to friends from back home. Staying connected to friends and family is important, but it’s easy to overdo it by constantly Facebook messaging or Skyping. There will be time to reconnect when you go back home. There will be time to tell stories and update each other on your lives. Spend more of your time creating the stories first while you’re in a different part of the world.
3. Don’t feel guilty for spending a day in. While you might feel pressure to take advantage of every moment and every day while you’re abroad, I think it’s very important to take a few mental health days to just process everything that is happening.
